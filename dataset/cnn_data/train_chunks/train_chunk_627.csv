"[author . PUBLISHED: . 10:52 EST, 8 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:52 EST, 8 July 2013 . A romantic couple have journeyed across the country just to kiss at the end of every seaside pier. Hazel Preller, 43, and husband Jay, 55, spent two years travelling 7,000 miles across Britain and visiting 60 different seaside resorts to share a passionate smooch. They decided to attempt the feat after their local attraction, the Grand Pier in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, burned down in 2008. Pier romance: Hazel Preller and her husband Jay travelled 7,000 miles across Britain after making a pledge to kiss at the end of every seaside pier in the country (pictured here on Birnbeck Pier Weston Super Mare in October 2009) After travelling around the country they completed the challenge by getting married at the end of Brighton Pier, East Sussex. Hazel, a primary school teacher, said: 'It was a bit like a military operation, we had a big map with all the piers detailed on each so we could see which were near each other to visit. 'We could only do it on the weekends so we had to make sure we got in as much as we could. 'We had to plan all our routes in detail but it was worth it, especially for the kiss at each one. 'We learned so much about each pier, about how it was made and how it came to be. They were huge places back in their heyday so it was fascinating to find out all about them.' Now, after completing their adventure, Hazel has written a book detailing their journey. Big decision: They decided to undertake the farfetched-feat after their beloved Grand Pier, in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, burnt down in 2008 (pictured here on Clevedon Pier in May 2009) 'Perhaps our book can start a new craze. Some of the piers have become derelict and others are in need of major repairs,' she added. 'By highlighting this perhaps more people will get involved in helping to save them.' The couple, who have five children between them, first met after becoming friends over the internet in 2007. When Weston pier burnt down, followed closely by Fleetwood pier, Lancs., the pair jokingly discussed how many piers were left to share a kiss on. Over the next two years the couple travelled more than 7,000 miles, visiting 60 spots before marrying in October 2010 on Brighton Pier, East Sussex. So in love: Hazel has written a book about the couple's challenge which features 30 different photographs of the different places the couple visited, as well as some snaps of the couple kissing on some . The newlyweds and their 40 guests enjoyed a ride on the carousel before tucking into seaside-themed food and cutting a wedding cake in the shape of a sandcastle - as well as enjoying their 60th pier kiss. Hazel and Jay, of Weston-super-Mare, even had to gain special permission from the Manx Government to visit the Queen's Pier at Ramsey, on the Isle of Mann. 'The pier at Ramsey was shut to the public because it needed a lot of repairs doing to it,' said Hazel. 'We thought there was no harm in asking anyway, and the government were quite happy to give us permission - as long as we let a local news reporter cover the story.' As a result of the visit the couple have now been made honorary life members of the Isle of Mann Pier. Each chapter in the book, 'From Piers to Eternity', painstakingly written by Hazel, represents an individual visit. Matrimony: The newlyweds and their 40 guests enjoyed a ride on the carousel on Brighton Pier, East Sussex before tucking into seaside themed food and cutting a wedding cake in the shape of a sandcastle - as well as enjoying their 60th pier kiss . During one excursion the couple took in a record 10 piers in just one weekend. Hazel said her and Jay could not pick a favourite pier, but one that stood out was Southwold Pier, in Suffolk. She said: 'The pier is so quirky and yet so quintessentially English. 'It is really well themed with seaside benches with eels on the handles and a water clock as well as a telescope at the end of the pier where apparently you get to see mermaids. 'We have a soft spot for Brighton as well. We had hoped to marry on Weston's pier but it wasn't to be because they hadn't rebuilt it in time. 'We had to decide somewhere else to go and Brighton was the last place to visit. I'm so glad we did now, it was gorgeous.' Busy: During one excursion the couple took in a record 10 piers in just one weekend (pictured here on Cleethorpes Pier) The book features 30 different photographs of the different places the couple visited, as well as some snaps of the couple kissing on some. 'At the time there was not a definitive guide book about all the piers of Britain, so we thought it would be nice to write a book about them as we went round,"" Hazel added . 'It's a bit of a one-off. Humourous, factual, and a bit of a tourist guide all mixed in together. 'The book is about two love stories. It's about how Jay and I fell in love with each other as we travelled, and then our love for piers.'

From Botox and lasers to surgery and . high-end face creams containing a whole host of bizarre ingredients, it . seems that we have entered a new era in the . fight against ageing. But the . latest addition to the litany of unusual lotions and potions is an anti-ageing cream which claims to have the most expensive ingredients ever. Cult 51 will cost £125 for a 1.6 fl oz . (50ml) jar, equivalent to £94,000 a tonne, when it goes on sale online . and at upmarket London store Fortnum and Mason tomorrow. Age defying: A new anti-ageing cream, which is the most expensive in the world, already has a waiting list of 5,000 women ahead of its unveiling tomorrow . Model Kelly Brook and singer Myleene Klass are already fans of the night cream made by British chemist Richard Mears after being given samples, but if you're hoping to get your hands on it, join the queue because there's already 5,000 women on the waiting list. In trials so far, Cult 51 has been found to reverse the signs of ageing by up to five years in just six weeks. It is clinically proven to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines by up to 52 per cent in 28 days. It increases the skin’s absorption of oxygen by up to 45 per cent and in trials reduced the appearance of age spots by up a quarter in 12 weeks. Mr Mears said it is the first skincare product on the market that can claim to have ‘3D effects’ as it stimulates the skin to produce its own collagen while increasing cell production and oxygen flow in the skin. He said: 'Most anti-ageing creams do only one or two things, so consumers end up buying several products, such as those aimed at day time use, nights, the eyes and skin brightening, to get the full benefits. All-in-one: The multi-purpose product increases the skin's absorption of oxygen by up to 45 per cent and in trials reduced the appearance of age spots by up a quarter in 12 weeks . 'Brands want to sell many products to their customers and maximise sales. However, there is an accepted wisdom within skin care that the skin can only absorb so much active and that too many products actually smother it, preventing it from functioning naturally.' Mr Mears, who has developed skin products for many luxury cosmetic brands in the past 25 years, said Cult 51’s main ingredient is ATP, a naturally found cell-producing compound which diminishes with age. Mr Mears said Cult 51 will increase ATP levels by up to 65 per cent and strengthen the skin’s capillary walls, boosting blood circulation. It also reacts to humidity, working harder in an air-conditioned environment and cuts the amount of melanin in the skin - which leads to age spots. The developers said the raw materials used in the cream are the most expensive ever. Ingredients for a mass market skin care lotion would cost between £800 and £1,500 per metric tonne, while those in a professional cream could cost up £20,000 per metric tonne. However, the materials used in Cult 51 would add up to £94,000 per metric tonne. It’s the first product to deliver total skin care suitable for face, eyes, dicolletage and hands. Among trial volunteers, one woman said using Cult 51 for two weeks cleared up a problem over sensitive skin, while another who had acne scarring found pockmarks had virtually disappeared after eight weeks. The product is available online via the website www.cult51.com.

She was the quintessential perfect nanny who every child dreamed of floating into their lives under her magical black umbrella. Now a real Mary Poppins has emerged in the form of Brenda Ashford, a 92-year-old nanny who has cared for over 100 children over her 62 year career. Speaking on This Morning she described being a nanny as ‘a calling rather an occupation’ she attended the prestigious Norland Nanny School. One of six children, Brenda says her love of children says started at age 9 when her little brother was born. Brenda Ashford appeared with her surrogate daughter Susanna, who she cared for from 10 days old . At an impressive age of 92, Brenda has cared for over 100 children in her 62 year career . ‘I just adored babies, and my youngest brother was a special baby to me because I was able to do things for him. ‘I used to help my mother with him and do things like put him in my doll pram and push him around.’ She attended the Norland College when she was 18, inspired, she says, by her own mother, who had wanted to be a nanny. ‘Mother had 6 of us in 10 years. She wanted to be a Norland nanny but at the time it wasn’t considered quite the ‘right thing’ and her father did not want her to be a nanny. Brenda talks of how at Norland College, as well as learning all about childcare, the student nannies first did 3 months of training in domestic work. ‘We learnt everything from cleaning shoes to cleaning lavatories.’ Brenda appeared on This Morning to discuss her new book 'Tuppence for Paper and String' which chronicles Brenda's experiences .

A broken piece of track could be to blame for the commuter train collision outside New York City that injured more than 70 people. Officials investigating the cause of the crash ruled out foul play, and sent a damaged section of railway track for analysis. It is not clear if the accident . was caused by the broken piece of track, or if it was damaged before the crash, said Earl Weener, of the National Transportation Safety Board. He added that the investigation was in its early stages, and refused to speculate on why the train derailed near Bridgeport, at 6.10pm. Scroll down for video . Crash site: Investigators sift through the wreckage of the commuter train crash in Bridgeport . Seventy-two people were sent to hospital after a Metro-North train from New York City, derailed and was hit by a train coming from New Haven. Senator Chris Murphy said it was 'frankly amazing' that none of the 700 people on board the two trains was killed. 'The damage is absolutely staggering,' Richard Blumenthal added. The senator, who visited several patients in the hospital, described shattered interiors of carriages and tons of . metal tossed around. 'The sides of cars are torn away like ribbons of cloth,' Mr Blumenthal told the CT Post. 'I feel that we are fortunate that even more . injuries were not the result of this very tragic and unfortunate . accident,' he said. The National Transportation Safety Board began its investigation on Saturday, which is expected to last for seven to 10 days.

'[Passenger] . safety, and the safety of our employees, is always the first priority in . everything we do,' Howard Permut, president of MTA Metro-North . Railroad, said. The railway tracks were damaged in the crash, and Amtrak was forced to suspend services between New York and Boston.

Nigella Lawson has taken her two teenage children to view a house in central London in what seems to be further proof her marriage to Charles Saatchi may be over. She was shown around the mews home - which is available to let for £11,000-a-month and worth £2.5million - by an estate agent on Friday, accompanied by her sister Horatia and children Cosima, 19, and Bruno, 17. The television chef, 53, had already moved her family out of their £14million home in . Chelsea after pictures showing her husband holding her by the throat . were published. House-hunting: Nigella Lawson took her two teenage children to view a property on Friday. She is pictured returning to the Mayfair flat where she is temporarily staying earlier this week . Miss Lawson appeared pale and did not smile as the group viewed the property, the Sunday People reported. Today a friend of the couple said the argument which triggered the assault was over whether her son Bruno should remain living at home. Both the chef's children are from her first marriage to journalist John Diamond, who died of throat cancer in 2001. The family friend told the Sunday Express that Mr Saatchi did not want the teenager staying at home any more as they did not get on. 'He says he feels 'crowded' - even though their house is huge,' the source told the newspaper. 'Nigella is naturally protective. She's not about to just see her son . chucked out but whenever the subject is broached it always ends in an . argument.

Last week, more of Miss Lawson's belongings were removed from her Chelsea home. One of the vans contained a box which clearly had the words 'Bruno's room' written on it. Two string instruments and a skateboard were loaded into van by a removal company. Some of the chef's cooking equipment was also taken with a crepe maker being added to the pile of belongings. When Nigella Lawson moved out, her husband Charles Saatchi had played down photographs of him grabbing her by the throat and tweaking her nose at a restaurant as a ‘playful tiff’. But she appears to have dashed any hopes that the marriage of the couple - who have a £14million marital home in Chelsea, west London - can be reconciled.

Other items including Miss Lawson’s . weights and exercise ball, dresses, hats, toys, toiletries and even a . bag of wrapping paper were loaded into the van. One box contained a can labelled . Cannabis – which despite the alarming name is a legal energy drink . containing hemp extract. Miss Lawson was not seen at the move and Saatchi turned up . only after the process was complete. There were so many possessions that . the removal team made two runs. Chef: A man was seen removing a box that had 'cookbooks' written on it from the house . Insturment: A Gibson guitar is carefully packed into place among Miss Lawson's other possessions . One onlooker said he had been told that some statues had been removed earlier in the day. ‘It . looked very much like Nigella is moving all of her personal possessions . out of the house – and isn’t going to be back in a hurry,’ he said. Many . items were apparently taken to a storage facility while the rest were . taken to an address some seven miles away in south-west London where . Miss Lawson appears to be setting up home. The . 53-year-old has been seen several times looking drawn and without . her wedding ring, and while her two children and sister have visited, . there has been no sign of her husband of ten years. Saatchi, 70, has accepted a police caution for assault for the scenes that provoked their split, despite playing it down. The . advertising tycoon turned modern art mogul was photographed grabbing . Miss Lawson by the throat and tweaking her nose outside Scotts . restaurant in central London during an extraordinary 27-minute incident. Belongings: Miss Lawson's keep-fit equipment is packed into the van, along with bags and some summer hats . Loading: A plastic box full of personal effects is loaded, including a can of Cannabis Energy Drink . When . Miss Lawson left home after the photos were published a week later, . Saatchi claimed he had simply suggested she moved out to wait for ‘the . dust to settle’. He initially tried to explain the throat-grabbing as a ‘playful tiff’. When further pictures of him twisting Miss Lawson’s nose emerged, he said he had merely been trying to clean her nose. Miss Lawson’s spokesman last night continued to refuse to comment either on the assault incident or on the state of her marriage.

A nearby solar system is packed with up to seven planets including three 'super-Earths' that may be capable of supporting life, say scientists. The planets orbit Gliese 667C, one of three stars bound together in a triple system 22 light years away in the constellation of Scorpius. Astronomers believe they fill up the star’s habitable zone - the orbital region just the right distance away to permit mild temperatures and liquid water. Scroll down for video . Super-Earth Gliese 667Cb orbits the star Gliese 667C. A record-breaking three planets in this system are super-Earths lying in the zone around the star where liquid water could exist, making them possible candidates for the presence of life . Three of the new worlds are categorised as 'super-Earths', meaning they have between one and 10 times the mass of the Earth. If, like the Earth, they are rocky and possess atmospheres and watery lakes or oceans, they could conceivably harbour life. Because Gliese 667C is part of a triple system, anyone standing on one of the planets would see three suns in the sky. At night, the two companion stars would be as bright as the full moon on Earth. An artist's impression of a sunset seen from the super-Earth Gliese 667Cc. The brightest star in the sky is Gliese 667C. Astronomers have estimated that there are tens of billions of such rocky worlds orbiting faint red dwarf stars in the Milky Way . An artist's impression of the view from Gliese 667Cd looking towards the planet's parent star, Gliese 667C . Previous studies had identified three planets orbiting the star, including one in the habitable zone. The other planets were discovered after astronomers revisited previous data and made new observations using a range of telescopes. Lead scientist Dr Guillem Anglada-Escuda, from the University of Gottingen in Germany, said: 'We identified three strong signals in the star before, but it was possible that smaller planets were hidden in the data. 'We re-examined the existing data, added some new observations, and applied two different data analysis methods especially designed to deal with multi-planet signal detection. 'Both methods yielded the same answer: there are five very secure signals and up to seven low-mass planets in short-period orbits around the star.' Gliese 667C is smaller, fainter and cooler than the sun, having just over a third of its mass. As a result, its habitable zone - where conditions are warm but not scalding hot - is relatively close in. This is helpful to astronomers because the limits of current technology make it hard to detect smaller Earth-like planets in more distant orbits. Planets in the Gliese 667C system in relation to their star. This is the first system found with a fully packed habitable zone . The astronomers believe the star’s habitable zone is full - there are no more stable, long-lived orbits available within it that could contain other planets. If the Earth circled the sun at the same distance, it would be far too hot to support life. But much milder conditions may exist on planets orbiting close to dimmer, cooler stars such as Gliese 667C. Since low-mass stars make up around 80 per cent of the stars in our galaxy, the Milky Way, astronomers hope they might provide a rich harvest of other potentially habitable close-orbiting planets. 'The number of potentially habitable planets in our galaxy is much greater if we can expect to find several of them around each low-mass star,' said co-researcher Dr Rory Barnes, from the University of Washington in the US. 'Instead of looking at 10 stars to look for a single potentially habitable planets, we now know we can look at just one star and find several of them.' The sky around the triple star Gliese 667. The bright star at the centre is Gliese 667 A and B, the two main components of the system, which cannot be separated in this image . The findings, released by the European Southern Observatory, are to appear in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. Although the planets are far too small to see with a telescope, they could be detected by looking for the effect of their gravity on the star. The gravitational 'tug' of an orbiting planet makes a star 'wobble' which in turn causes its light wavelength to fluctuate. By measuring these tiny changes astronomers can calculate the planet’s orbit and mass.","Planets orbit Gliese 667C in a triple system in constellation of Scorpius .

It is the high octane, adrenaline-fuelled extravaganza that injures - and sometimes kills - hundreds of of people a year and has been branded cruel by animal welfare groups. But in extraordinary scenes today, the annual bull-running festival of San Fermin - made famous by Ernest Hemingway's novel, The Sun Also Rises -  showed it has lost none of its lure, as thousands of people packed the streets of Pamplona to mark the start of nine days of blood and gore. Bedecked in white and holding the traditional vivid red scarves, a writhing mass of humanity basked in blazing temperatures as they prepared for the traditional launch of a firework that signals the release of the bulls. Sea of humanity: The square in Pamplona is packed with thousands of people ahead of the start of the nine-day bull-running festival of San Fermin . Riot of colour: A glorious sea of red means it only one thing in Pamplona - bulls . Defiant: Concerns over animal welfare were ignored by the throng of people who flock to Basque city every year for perhaps the most famous festival in Spain . Packed in tight: Revelers kick off the event with a party ahead of the launching of a rocket to mark the release of the bulls . United: Several thousand people hold up the traditional red scarf as they celebrate the beginning of the festival . Hedonistic: Passions run high for one couple, right, while a group of men get into the spirit of things, right . The party was delayed briefly after suspected nationalists draped the Basque flag over the city hall. Six 100-stone bulls and six steers from are set free from their corral and a crowd of revellers will then run for nearly a kilometre through the city, ending up at the bullring. There are absolutely no hiding places. Workers erect 12-feet barriers along the route, and many participants push their luck too far. Around 200 are injured during San Fermin each year, and the bull runs have claimed 15 lives since 1924, with the most recent death, that of a 62-year-old Spaniard, occurring in 2003. Surfing: A girl rides the crowd, as the party atmosphere reaches fever pitch . Thirsty work: A reveler drinks wine at the start of a festival that injures on average about 200 people a year . Celebration: A group of men hoist a woman in the air during the 'Chupinazo' marking the start of the San Fermin Festival . Tradition: Revellers gathered in Ayuntamiento square, in Pamplona, to mark the start of the famous festival . Red and white: People gathered in the square are covered in red paint and consume red drinks . Party: A man is held aloft above the crowd, where everyone has come dressed in white . The issue of animal rights has long gone hand-in-hand with San Fermin. The bulls that take part in the run each morning are killed by bullfighters in the evening, usually in a slow and torturous manner.

'Every shared tapa, every cerveza, every booked hotel room and balcony bolsters the killing. As long as the city makes money off the event, bulls will continue to suffer and die.' 'Tormenting and butchering bulls for entertainment belongs to the dark ages – not the 21st century.' The League Against Cruel Sports, a charity, blamed 'lads magazines' for 'sensationalising the event... playing up the braveness' of the human participants, and glossing over 'the reality as to how the bull run ends'.

The ZEOD RC will make its race debut at next year's Le Mans 24 Hour event in France. Scroll down for video . Nissan has unveiled the world's fastest electric car - the Zero Emission On Demand Racing Car. ZEOD RC for short, the car can reach speeds of up to 185mph and will make its race debut at next year's Le Mans 24 hours event in France . The ZEOD RC will compete under the Automobile Club de l'Ouest's 'Garage 56' entry at the 2014 Le Mans event - an additional spot on the grid especially for vehicles that showcase innovative technology . The technology in Nissan's ZEOD RC car builds upon its electric designs in its Leaf model. Leaf stands for Leading, Environmentally friendly, Affordable, Family. It uses an 80 kW and 280 N-m front-mounted electric motor that drives the front axle, powered by a 24 kilowatt-hours lithium ion battery pack. This system is designed to create up to 90 kilowatts (120 hp) power. The current Leaf model can reach speeds of up to 93 mph and it goes from zero to 60 mph in 9.9 seconds. The battery pack is designed to retain 70 to 80 per cent of its capacity for 10 years. The Leaf also has an auxiliary 12-volt lead-acid battery that powers the car computer systems including the radio, headlights and windshield wipers. A U.S version also has a small solar panel on the rear spoiler. Nissan unveiled the car to fans ahead of this weekend's Le Mans 24 Hour race. The car will compete under the Automobile Club de l'Ouest's 'Garage 56' entry - an additional spot on the grid for vehicles that showcase new . and innovative technology. Nissan plans to test various types of engine and electric technologies in the new car over the next year to increase its performance for the race. These trials will then be used to create technology for future electric road cars. Nissan said it will showcase these developments as they happen on its YouTube channel and Nismo.TV. The ZEOD RC design team was headed by Ben Bowlby who was recently appointed as Nissan's Director of Motorsport Innovation. The technology in Nissan's ZEOD RC is a modified version of the electric engine used in its LEAF road car. The LEAF reaches top speeds of around 93mph while the ZEOD RC can achieve 185mph . Bowley said: 'The Nissan ZEOD RC is a natural progression that follows on from the development of the Nissan LEAF road car and the LEAF RC race car prototype. 'The technologies developed through the program will form part of future innovations for road cars. 'The program is designed to develop multiple technologies to evaluate how they could be used for a future return of Nissan at Le Mans. We are investigating multiple options. The ZEOD RC model unveiled ahead of this weekend's Le Mans race is a prototype. Nissan plans to test various types of engine and electric technologies in the new car over the next year to increase its performance for the race . An ZEOD RC driver can to switch between electric and petrol-powered drive. Nissan's design team claim that this a technology that could be added to road cars in the future in addition to pure electric power . 'A Zero Emission On Demand option - where the driver can switch between electric and petrol-powered drive - is a future direction for road cars, so that will be tested in addition to pure electric power and other new technologies.' While current battery technology doesn't provide the energy storage capacity to race a solely electric Le Mans prototype, Bowlby believes the development of the car will be an important step in the 'electrification' of motorsport. 'A car like this provides an incredibly challenging test bed for what could be highly-effective options for road cars. Throughout the next year we will be testing multiple drive trains in an extensive test program,' Bowlby said. Nissan's cars currently don't have the energy storage capacity to race a solely electric Le Mans prototype but its designer Ben Bowlby wants to change this during the trials. He believes the development of the car will be an important step in the 'electrification' of motorsport . 'Nissan is a leader in electric vehicle . technology for the road, now we want to take those lessons learnt and . utilize that knowledge base in the development of the new race car.' Launched in 2010, the Nissan LEAF has become the world's best-selling all-electric car. Nissan launched the Nissan LEAF RC in 2011 - a race car powered by the same 107-hp electric motor that is used in the road car. The LEAF RC uses Leaf’s lithium-ion battery pack and 80-kW, 107 horse power motor.","Nissan's ZEOD RC is more than twice as fast as current electric road cars .

Miguel Caballero, known as the Armani of armoured clothing, displaying his new bulletproof clothing for children. Six teachers and 20 children were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, when Adam Lanza, 20, stormed into the building and opened fire. Mr Caballero already made a range of bullet proof clothing but decided after the attack to start a range of children’s backpacks. They have proved a hit, he told CBS, with parents desperate to protect their children from the spectre of another school bloodbath. The backpacks launched under the MC Kids brand, and the US distribution rights were secured by Elite Sterling Security. Timothy Hogan of Elite Sterling Security was delighted with the take-up since the backpacks went on sale in March. They cost $250 (£162) each but the company has still managed to sell more than 300 of them in three months. Bulletproof backpacks produced for boys and girls following the massascre at Sandy Hook Elementary School last year. Despite a price tag of $245 (£160) They have proved popular with parents who want their children to have added protection.

It's just one more level of protection that can help take care of our kids.’ The backpacks have been made for younger children but there have also been requests for a range suitable for high school pupils. Mr Caballero and his US  have begun work on creating a larger backpack and hope to have them ready for the market later this year.

Target: The company has stores in 49 of the country's 50 states, as well as Canada and parts of India . Douglas Dayton started working in the family business after serving in an Army infantry division in Europe during World War II, where he was injured and received a Purple Heart. Having worked as a store manager, Dayton sensed the threat of discount retailers like Kmart. In 1960, he became the first president of Target, and within two years, the company had opened four Target stores in the Twin Cities suburbs. 'Target was the best job I had,' he recalled in a May interview with the (Minneapolis) Star Tribune. Humble beginnings: The first Target store was opened in 1962 in nearby Roseville, Minnesota . Dayton is the uncle of Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton. The governor issued a statement calling his uncle 'an extraordinary businessman, philanthropist, and leader of our family.' According to an obituary prepared by his family, Douglas Dayton left the Target presidency in 1968 and returned to help run the Dayton-Hudson department store parent company. That business eventually was consolidated into Target Corp. The company has expanded nationally and into Canada, and is now ranked No. 36 on the Fortune 500. The Dayton family has not been involved in its ownership or operations for a number of years. All things to all people: Target recently opened a new store concept, called CityTarget. The first stores were opened in July, 2012, in Chicago, Seattle, and Los Angeles . Most of the former Dayton's department stores in Minnesota are today operated by Macy's. Dayton left the company in 1974 and formed a venture capital firm. He retired in 1994 but remained active in a number of charitable and philanthropic groups. 'He and his brothers shared a common vision for improvement to the community, and to give back what the community had given them,' Wendy Dayton said Sunday. She said he focused his philanthropic efforts on expanding access to education and social justice, and to preservation of the arts and nature.","Douglas James Dayton took over the family’s downtown Minneapolis department store from their father in 1948 .

'Bring it on,' she told reporters when the news broke. 'Gosh, it’s going to be a fun race!' Davis has already said she plans to make Spitzer's past association with her ladies of the evening a central campaign issue, saying that 'it would be a disgrace for the City of New York to allow an unpunished criminal who committed multiple felonies to be re-elected back into office.' She tweeted a reminder on Sunday evening that it was Spitzer who, as governor in 2007, signed a bill into law that 'made it a felony 4 a man to use prostitutes.' 'Not that I think that should be criminal but he sure did.' Political Wire's Taegan Goddard tweeted what many pundits are thinking. Other tweets predicted a Bill Clinton run for Parks and Recreation Director . Politico's Alex Burns offered help to Jay Leno's joke writers, who will soon be competing with the rest of the late-night universe to find new ways to poke fun at New York's political scene . Former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer represented George W. Bush for more than two years. His critics would say he knows a thing or two about laughing stocks . Davis' illicit operation, the . Emperors Club VIP, attracted the attention of federal law enforcement, . which caught Spitzer on a wiretap arranging a sex-for-pay session in . Washington, D.C. with a woman whose stage name was Ashley Alexandra Dupré. 'I have acted in a way that violates my . obligations to my family and violates my - or any - sense of right or . wrong,' Spitzer finally said in a short speech, after media reports identified him as a man referred to in court documents only as 'Client 9.' After federal authorities determined that he never used use public money or campaign funds to pay for his romps, Spitzer never faced criminal charges. But room 871 at the tony Mayflower Hotel in Washington, where he spent 1,000 per hour for his sexcapades, has become a minor tourist attraction. Spitzer's brethren: Former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford (L) won his race for Congress after an affair with his now-fiancee María Belén Chapur. Anthony Weiner (R), posing with a drag queen during New York City's gay pride parade, resigned from Congress after long denying that he tweeted inappropriate photos of himself . The Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C. was Eliot Spitzer's preferred home-away-from-home when he enjoyed the company of $1,000-per-hour prostitutes . The 2009 documentary 'Client 9: The Rise and Fall of Eliot Spitzer' tells the story of the governor's fall from grace, and the corporate titans who were happy to see him self-destruct . The Big Apple's political . establishment is already reeling from the specter of an Anthony Weiner . victory in the Democratic mayoral primary, which would make him a heavy . favorite to claim Gracie Mansion in the fall. Weiner, far less famous for his time . in Congress than for tweeting photos of himself in various states of . undress to young women who were not his newlywed wife, has seized on the . mayoral race as a platform for redemption in a  city known for its . hard-nosed politics and an anything-goes election philosophy.

Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer dropped out of the mayoral race to run for comptroller instead, but with Eliot Spitzer and his millions now in play, he's no longer a lock to win . Spitzer co-hosted a short-lived CNN show with Washington Post columnist Kathleen Parker. Originally called 'Parker Spitzer,' it was renamed 'In The Arena' when Parker left four months after it debuted. The show was canceled after less than nine months on the air . Manhattan Borough President Scott . Stringer was considered the odds-on favorite to win the controller's . race before Spitzer entered the fray on Sunday. His campaign came out swinging within an hour of Spitzer's announcement. 'Scott Stringer has a proven record of results and integrity and entered this race to help New York’s middle class regain its footing,' said Stringer campaign manager Sascha Owen. 'By contrast, Eliot Spitzer is going to spurn the campaign finance program to try and buy personal redemption with his family fortune.' Spitzer is expected to self-finance his bid for comptroller - 'He apparently likes to pay for it,' quipped a series of tweeters on Sunday - using a real estate fortune that includes office buildings along the Mid-Atlantic seaboard from New York to Washington. Those properties include two Manhattan apartment buildings within blocks of each other on swanky Fifth Avenue: one where Spitzer lived for years with his wife Silda, and another where his father lives. The New York Post reported in May that the former governor was actually living in the second building, away from his wife. Presaging an awkward wife-to-wife phone call, New York Post columnist John Podhoretz tweeted his gleeful imagination of a conversation in which the spouses of Anthony Weiner and Eliot Spitzer compare notes . Twitter exploded Sunday evening after Spitzer entered the comptroller race, but former madam Kristin Davis may have the last laugh at the debate . As late-night joke writers and newspaper headline gurus ponder their good fortune, New Yorkers can expect to . relive the 2008 Spitzer episode, with all its tawdry underpinnings, . between now and November. That includes the money, the sex, the sensationalized downfall, and even the mid-calf black socks that he . allegedly declined to take off during his encounters with prostitutes. But even with the possibility of New York City's top two officeholders sporting the names Weiner and Spitzer, the newer candidate has so far refused to draw any lines of connection between his situation and Anthony Weiner's. 'I don't draw conclusions from anyone else's dynamic or situation,' he told the Daily News. 'The more people get into politics, the healthier it is. I hope the public gives me a fair shot.'","Eliot Spitzer will run for NYC comptroller against Kristin Davis, the former madam who hooked him up with $1,000-per-hour sex romps .

The Olympic opening ceremony took place under threat of a cyber attack, security experts have revealed. Nearly a year on, Oliver Hoare, head of cyber security for the London 2012 Games, has told how officials feared the Olympic stadium lights could be switched off by a remote attack. He was telephoned by Government intelligence agency GCHQ in the early hours of July 27, the day of the £27million opening ceremony with the warning. The Queen and Daniel Craig, left, were one of the many highlights of the £27million ceremony, which went off without a hitch despite threats that the Olympic stadium could face a cyber attack . The threat was discovered by GCHQ only hours before the ceremony began on July 27 last year . The threat failed to materialise, but security officials have now revealed the extent of the precautions they took to make sure the celebrations went off without a hitch. 'There was a suggestion that there was a credible attack on the electricity infrastructure supporting the Games,' Mr Hoare told a BBC Radio 4 programme, which will be broadcast this evening. 'And the first reaction to that is, ""Goodness, you know, let's make a strong cup of coffee and get into the office"".' Mr Hoare said that extensive testing took place in anticipation of a wide range of attacks, including the exact scenario that raised concerns at GCHQ. He said: 'We'd tested no less than five times the possibility of an attack, a cyber attack, on the electricity infrastructure. 'In a sense I think we felt pretty well prepared, but there's always an amount of concern, particularly when you've only got eight or nine hours before the opening ceremony.' The Government, Olympic organiser Locog and service providers such as BT were all part of a team that responded to such threats. The primary response to the threat came from the Olympic Cyber Co-ordination Team, based at MI5 headquarters in Thames House. Chris Hoy leading Great Britain's athletes out during the opening ceremony on July 27 last year. The head of cyber security for the Games said there was enough back-up to keep the stadium alight no matter what . This involved assessing how credible the threat of attack might be, a process which took place while officials put in place a contingency plan. 'The clock was absolutely ticking,' Mr Hoare told the BBC. 'We effectively switched to manual, or had the facility to switch to manual. 'It's a very crude way of describing it, but effectively we had lots of technicians stationed at various points.' He said there was so much back-up in place that 'if all the lights went out in east London you could guarantee that the Olympic Stadium would still be burning brightly'. In the afternoon before the ceremony, a Cabinet meeting discussed contingency plans and ministers were informed of the issues. A BBC Radio 4 programme will reveal the fears for the first time tonight . But officials became increasingly confident that they could deal with the threat if it happened. An hour before the ceremony, a colleague told Mr Hoare: 'if the lights go down we can get them up and running regardless within 30 seconds'. 'Thirty seconds at the opening ceremony with the lights going down would have been catastrophic in terms of reputational hit,' Mr Hoare said. 'So I watched the opening ceremony with a great deal of trepidation.' The attack failed to materialise, but Mr Hoare said he twitched every time the lights in the stadium dimmed as he watched the ceremony at home with his family, who were unaware of the threat. He said: 'You wouldn't be human if you didn't have butterflies.'","GCHQ found out about the threat only hours ahead of July 27 ceremony .

A 35-year-old Florida man who was accused of killing and then eating parts of a homeless man in Connecticut was found not guilty of murder by reason of insanity. Tyree Lincoln Smith of Bridgeport will still likely spend the rest of his life locked up, but in a mental facility and not a prison. A three-judge panel found that while the prosecution proved Smith had indeed killed homeless man Angel Gonzales, the defense also proved that Smith hadn't committed murder per se because he was mentally ill. Insane: Tyree Lincoln Smith in court today, after receiving the judgement that he wax not guilty, but found insane . The decision was met with joy from family members of the victim. 'Justice has been served!' Talitha Frazier, sister-n-law of Gonzales yelled. 'I don't care where he serves the rest of his life as long as it's behind locked doors.' Earlier, Talitha had gotten into an argument in the courtroom with one of Smith's family members, distraught at the decision. 'Tyree, Tyree! I'm your blood, I'm your blood,' the man who would only identify him as a relative of Smith's said. 'I ain't saying he didn't do it, I know he did - but I'm his blood,' the man said. Justice: Talitha Frazier, left, sister-in-law of the victim Angel Gonzalez, right, was happy with today's outcome . Smith will be taken to Whiting Forensic Institute in Middletown, Connecticut until his next court date on September 9. Psychiatrists will then testify as to whether it's safe to send him back into the community - which is unlikely. 'We have to look at the big picture,' said Smith's lawyer Joseph Bruckmann. 'We can't overlook that he ate part of the man's brain and his eyeballs in a cemetery. 'The defendant was unable, as a result of a mental disease, a psychosis attended by command hallucinations, to control his conduct within the requirements of the law,' one of the judge's said. 'There have been two tragedies in this case,' said Bruckmann. 'The first was the senseless death of Mr Gonzalez, and the second is that Tyree Smith has been a tortured soul for many years. He's been tortured by voices for decades and now that he is properly medicated he is horrified he caused Mr Gonzalez's death.' In court: Smith at his arraignment in February 2012 . Smith was arrested last year and charged with murder over the killing of Angel Gonzalez, whose decomposed body was found on the third floor of an abandoned building in the town. Police in Bridgeport said Smith was . covered in blood when he told his cousin about the murder, after . developing a lust for blood he needed to satiate after eating a rare . steak. Caught: Smith's mugshot after he was found trying to escape to Florida . Gonzalez's body was found 39 days later by an inspector for a mortgage company. Smith came to the attention of authorities when his cousin contacted Bridgeport police about Gonzalez's slaying. She . told detectives that Smith had arrived at her house on December 15th, . 2011, and said he wanted to 'get blood on his hands' before going to the . abandoned home, where he used to live, according to an arrest warrant . affidavit. The next day, Smith returned to the cousin's house with blood on his pants, hands and an ax, the affidavit said. Police say he told his cousin he . had 'gotten his blood'. Smith . told his cousin, Nicole Rabb, that he killed Gonzalez with the ax and . beat the man's face and head. He said he then collected one . of his victim's eyes, 'which tasted like an oyster', and some of his . brain matter and consumed them in a nearby cemetery, washing it down . with sake, according to court documents. 'Tyree . told his cousin the blows to Gonzalez's head were so severe that he was . able to remove an eye from the man's head along with pieces of brain . matter and a piece of his skull,' the arrest warrant says. When he was arrested, Smith admitting seeing the body and said there were no eyes in it. He said he did not touch it, though. However, Smith admitted to the detectives that when his mother asked him if he killed the man, he confirmed that he had. Less than a month . after the killing, Smith was treated and released from St. Vincent's . Medical Center's Behavioral Health Services in Westport, Connecticut after being . discovered in a pharmacy bleeding from his wrist, which police said he . had slashed with a box cutter.

A disgraced dentist considered the mastermind of an illegal body parts harvesting ring has died at a New York prison aged 49. Michael Mastromarino was pronounced dead around 10am on Sunday at St Luke's Hospital in Cornwall, according to prison officials. The agency says that he had been taken there from the medical unit at Fishkill state prison. Died in prison: Michael Mastromarino was pronounced dead around 10 am on Sunday at St Luke's Hospital in Cornwall, according to prison officials . Officials say a medical examiner will . determine the cause of death, which appears to be from natural causes. His attorney told New Jersey media outlets that Mastromarino had cancer. The New York Times reported he had died from complications of metastatic liver cancer. The former Fort Lee, New Jersey dentist was sentenced in 2009 to up to 58 years in prison for his role in a multi-state ring that illegally harvested body parts. Mastromarino and others would cut up corpses from funeral homes and then sell the body parts to unsuspecting doctors. It had emerged in April that the criminal was dying of bone cancer which had spread through his entire body. His lawyer said at the time that he had been given his last rites. Mastromarino had made millions of dollars from his ghoulish practice of illicitly harvesting skin and bones from corpses. Lockdown: Mastromarino's death appears to be related to his battle with terminal bone cancer . Ghoulish: The body-snatcher harvested parts from more than 1,000 corpses which were sold on to medical centers . The harvesting ring dismembered more than 1,000 cadavers in unsanitary conditions in . New York state, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and sold parts to doctors . who transplanted them into patients. BBC veteran broadcaster Alistair Cooke was among the 1,000 victims of the body-snatching gang. Mastromarino had pleaded guilty to body stealing, reckless endangerment and enterprise corruption in 2008. Desecrated: Veteran BBC broadcaster Alistair Cooke was one of Mastromarino's victims . Brothers Louis and Gerald Garzone provided bodies from a pair of funeral homes and a crematorium they ran in Philadelphia to Mastromarino. They are currently serving between eight and 20 years. Mastromarino paid the Garzones for at . least 244 corpses that were carved up without families' permission and . without-medical tests, prosecutors said. Skin, bones, tendons and other parts, . some of them diseased, were then sold around the country for dental . implants, knee and hip replacements and other procedures. The tissue stolen from a single body often fetched about $4,000. Biomedical Tissue Services, which was . owned by Mastromarino, shipped the body parts to Regeneration . Technologies, LifeCell Corp, Tutogen Medical Inc and two non-profit . organisations, Lost Mountain Tissue Bank and Tissue Centre of Central . Texas. At the time of his sentencing, Mastromarino wept as he told the court: 'Words cannot express how sorry I am.' He called his crimes 'nothing less than disgusting and embarrassing'. Mastromarino had been serving an 18 to 54-year sentence for body stealing, forgery, grand larceny and enterprise corruption. He and his estranged wife Barbara agreed to pay $4.6million to victims' families. He is survived by two sons Michael and Jerry.","Michael Mastromarino was suffering from the cancer which had spread throughout his body, his lawyer revealed in April .

A new video released by the Hawthorne Police in California adds a new perspective on the shooting of a dog that caused uproar on the internet. On June 30, Leon Rosby was out walking his dog when he came across a police scene and started filming it while also blasting music from his car. Police then arrested him for 'interference with officers.' While being arrested, his dog escaped from his car and ran over to his owner. When the dog jumped at an officer, the officer shot and killed the dog. Scroll down for video . Police release another video: The new video, taken by another bystander, gives a closer-up view of what happened on June 30 . Escape: Rosby's dog jumps out of the car and runs over to his master . Loose dog: The officer attempts to grab the leash and restrain the dog, but is unable. When the dog lurches at him, he shoots . Shots: The video ends abruptly with the officer's first shot at the dog. Though the officer continues with more shots viewable in the first video, spokesman Swain says that's normal police procedure . The whole interaction was filmed by witnesses nearby, and one video posted to YouTube that same day went viral. That viral video attracted serious criticism for the officer's handling of the situation. In the week since that video was posted, outrage over the incident has spread both on the internet and in Hawthorne. Internet 'hacktivist' group Anonymous posted a threatening video to the police on July 3. 'Police of Hawthorne, you must know that you are our primary target. This matter will not remain unresolved. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us,' the masked Anonymous representative says in the video. About 100 members in the community held a protest outside police headquarters on June 6. A Change.org petition calling for the prosecution of the police officers had almost 98,000 signatures as of Monday night. Calling for reform: About 100 people gathered to protest the shooting of the dog outside of Hawthorne police headquarters on June 6 . There have even been death threats sent to the police officers involved, which has lead the department to take three officers off of street duty. But on July 7, the police released another video taken of the incident that shows more of Leon Rosby's interaction with police before his dog was fatally shot - A new perspective that they believe helps their case. This video was taken by another witness at the scene, and gives a closer perspective on the shooting, as well as clearer audio of the exchange between Rosby and Police. 'This video will help us tremendously regarding [Rosby's] actions prior to his arrest,' Lt. Scott Swain of the Hawthorne Police told The Huffington Post. 'You can see the officer gives out his hand to let the dog sniff it and tries to grab the leash.' Bystander: Leon Rosby, 52, was walking his dog and video-tapping a police scene when he was arrested for obstruction of justice . Detained: Rosby did not put up a fight and let the police officer's arrest him without incident after he put his dog in the car . Threats: The three police officers have since been pulled from street duty for their safety in Southern California after the video of them shooting the dog went viral . Killed: A police officer shot the dog when it ran over to his owner. Rosby is now in the process of filing a suit against the police department for the incident . As for criticism as to why the officer shot the dog so many times, Swain says that's just normal police procedure. 'We're not trained to shoot one shot or to shoot in the leg. You're always trained to shoot multiple shots. Firing a gun is a last resort. We're trained to eliminate the threat, and that's a judgement call on the officers.' Currently, the Hawthorne Police do not put their officers through dog training. 'We'll have to see about that at the end of this investigation,' Swain said. 'It's something that we'll consider.' Even with the new video, some remain skeptical of the officer's actions. Robert Helfend, a defense attorney in L.A. said that it seems police didn't have a plan in place with how to deal with the dog. 'It would seem, in hindsight, that the officers could have simply let Mr. Rosby go temporarily, to contain his animal,' Helfend said. 'They then could have permitted Mr. Rosby to phone someone to pick up the dog. The so-called crime that Mr. Rosby supposedly committed was not life-threatening nor was he a danger to the community.' While still upset with the police's handling of the situation, Rosby has spoken out discouraging others from threatening the officer's lives. Rosby in due in court for the interfering with police charge on August 12, and if convicted could serve between six months to a year in county jail.","A video showing the June 30 shooting of Leon Rosby's dog by police in Hawthorne, California went viral .

Freed: Addam Swapp pictured on July 3, 2013, just before he was released from prison after 25 years . Polygamous leader Addam Swapp, who bombed a Mormon church building and sparked a 13-day standoff in 1988 that left a corrections officer dead, was released from prison on Tuesday after more than 25 years behind bars. Swapp, 52, was accompanied by family members as he left Sanpete County Jail three months after members of the state board of pardons and parole approved his release, saying he had shown remorse for leading the standoff in Marion. At his September parole hearing, Swapp apologized and said he planned to join his wife Charlotte and wanted to use his freedom to live peacefully and 'be a blessing to my fellow man'. 'I desire when I get out of prison to live my life in such a manner that my family, friends, neighbors and community would find my presence in their lives a benefit and a blessing,' Swapp said in a written statement, according to a transcript of the hearing posted online by The Salt Lake Tribune. Swapp said he was a different man after serving time in state and federal prisons for manslaughter, attempted murder, possessing a bomb and other offenses. 'My core beliefs have completely changed,' he said. 'I am completely opposed to the violent acts I committed which got me sent to prison.' The standoff began after Swapp detonated 87 sticks of dynamite at a Mormon church building in Kamas on January 16, 1988. Swapp claimed it would lead to the overthrow of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and resurrect his father-in-law, John Singer, who was killed by police at the Marion compound in 1979. Authorities said Singer was fatally shot when he pointed a gun at officers trying to arrest him over his refusal to send his children to public schools. Singer, 48, was a practicing polygamist and blamed the LDS church for his legal problems after he was excommunicated.

Swapp claimed he had a revelation that Singer would return to life on the ninth anniversary of his death, which was barely two weeks away. Swapp, who went on to marry two of Singer's daughters, holed up in Singer's compound following the bombing. Nine children were among the 14 people barricaded with him in a log cabin. More than 100 officers surrounded the property after following tracks in the snow. Throughout the standoff, officers flashed bright lights and circled in noisy snowmobiles in the middle of the night to psychologically weaken members of the Singer-Swapp clan.

Zara Phillips insists she will carry on competing in top class horse trials despite her pregnancy. The 32-year-old granddaughter of the Queen, who was part of the Olympic medal-winning British eventing team last summer, is expecting her first baby with husband Mike Tindall in the New Year, Buckingham Palace announced yesterday. Although the NHS advises pregnant women not to continue with ‘inherently risky’ sports such as horse riding, former world champion Miss Phillips was competing at the Barbury International Horse Trials at the weekend. Happy couple: Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall were yesterday on Centre Court to watch the men's singles final between Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon . Appearance: Mike Tindall and Zara Phillips were on Centre Court for the Murray and Djokovic final yesterday . Miss Phillips, who is believed to be three months pregnant, came off her horse at one point, but was later described as ‘fine’. Yesterday a spokesman for Miss Phillips, as she is still known professionally, said she would carry on competing for several weeks at least. She is currently entered into three events later this month, with rides on six horses. The spokesman said: ‘She will definitely be back in the saddle soon. It’s business as usual at the moment. ‘She is entered into several events, but as with any rider, they treat each event on a case-by-case basis and if she pulls out of an event it will be because the horse isn’t ready, rather than her.’ But she later cautioned: ‘As you can imagine she is following all medical advice from her doctors. She is being sensible about this and is listening to what the doctors are telling her. ‘She couldn’t be happier about the baby and would never put her pregnancy in jeopardy.’ Equestrian star: Great Britain's Zara Phillips on Mr Murt takes part in the Cross Country during day three of the Barbury International Horse Trials at Barbury Castle, Wiltshire, on Saturday . Miss Phillips is well aware of the dangers of riding. She broke her collarbone in 2008 after she came off her horse at an event in France. The animal, Tsunami II, broke its neck and was killed in the fall. Two years previously her close friend, world-class rider Sherelle Duke, died when her horse fell on top of her during a competition. The news that another royal baby is on the way was announced formally in a statement by . 'Thanks for all the kind messages, we are very excited and I agree with you all that hopefully he/she won’t have my nose' Mike Tindall . Buckingham Palace yesterday. It said: ‘Mr and Mrs Mike Tindall are very pleased to announce that Zara Tindall is expecting a baby in the New Year. The Princess Royal and Captain Mark Phillips, Mr Phillip and Mrs Linda Tindall, and members of both families are delighted with the news. ‘This baby will be the first child for Mike and Zara and the third grandchild for The Princess Royal.’ The baby is believed to be due in January. The Queen was said to be ‘delighted’ about another addition to her family, as were the parents of Miss Phillips and Tindall. A spokesman for David Cameron said he would ‘send his very, very best wishes to the happy couple’. Later Tindall, a former England rugby captain, joked on Twitter: ‘Thanks for all the kind messages, we are very excited and I agree with you all that hopefully he/she won’t have my nose.’ Competing: Zara was part of last summer's silver medal winning Olympic Great Britain eventing team. She is pictured here riding High Kingdom during the eventing at Greenwich Park in south-east London in July 2012 . He has long been the butt of jokes for his misshapen nose, the result of several breaks during his international rugby career. Last night his father, Phil, told the Daily Mail: ‘We are very happy obviously and looking forward to having another baby in the family. Mike’s big brother had a daughter in February so it’s not our first grandchild and we know what to expect. ‘Mike rang to tell us about two weeks ago. We haven’t seen Mike or Zara since they told us the news but [we have] spoken to them on the phone. Obviously Mike is very happy and excited to be a father.’ The child will be 16th in line to the throne following the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s first baby later this month. It is believed Miss Phillips’s mother, Princess Anne, rode until she was 34 weeks pregnant. Well done: Zara Phillips gets a hug from Mike Tindall after the show-jumping stage of the equestrian event at Greenwich Park in July 2012 . And eventer Mary King, who rode for Britain at six consecutive Olympics, competed until she was five and a half months pregnant. She said: ‘The team doctor said that the baby was perfectly safe inside you, if you’re happy with what you’re doing just crack on.' The Mail’s medical expert, Dr Martin Scurr, said he advised mothers-to-be not to wrap themselves in cotton wool. ‘I think pregnant women shouldn’t be too over-protected and there is very little I wouldn’t advise them to do. She is a professional athlete and I really can’t see the harm in it,’ he said. ‘The fact is that her body will soon grow to such an extent that it probably wouldn’t be practical for her to compete anyway, although she could still ride for fun.’ The Queen's granddaughter Zara and Mr Tindall have talked openly about their desire to start a family. The pair's sporting commitments - particular Zara's Olympic dreams - have meant their schedules were hectic and much of their time was devoted to their respective rugby and eventing careers. In the summer of 2012, former world champion Zara achieved her dream of competing in the Olympics, winning a team silver in front of a home crowd in London. New arrival: Zara Phillips and rugby player Mike Tindall, who married in 2011, are expecting a baby . Tindall spoke about how they were waiting for the right window before having a baby. ‘Obviously we're going to have a family. But it's about timing,’ he said at the launch of his new charity Rugby For Heroes in May 2012. ‘Obviously it's the Olympics this year, the Europeans next year, the World Championships the year after for her. I want to play for another two years, so it's just where we find the balance in that. ‘I wouldn't say we'll wait, we'll try and find a window.’ 'Obviously we're going to have a family. But it's about timing' Mike Tindall, speaking in May 2012 . The pair are already a doting aunt and . uncle to their two nieces, Savannah and Isla - the daughters of Zara's . brother Peter and his wife Autumn. The royal baby will be the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh's fourth great grandchild, after Savannah and Isla Phillips and William and Kate's baby, which is due this month. Zara's pregnancy comes in the year of the 60th anniversary of the Queen's coronation, with the baby set to arrive in the New Year of 2014. The couple wed in July 2011 in Edinburgh's Canongate Kirk in a private ceremony attended by all the senior members of the Royal Family, three months after Zara's cousin William married Kate. Picture perfect: Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall in Holyrood Abbey, Palace of Holyroodhouse, at their wedding . Zara's ivory silk faille and duchess satin gown was by one of the Queen's favourite designers, Stewart Parvin. Royal event: Mike Tindell and Zara Phillips attend a service at Westminster Abbey in honour of the 60th anniversary of the Queen's Coronation last month . Tindall said his wedding topped winning the World Cup, and Zara described the day as ‘amazing’. Just months later, newlywed Tindall was fined and booted out of the England rugby squad for drunken antics during the World Cup in New Zealand. He apparently took part in a ‘dwarf tossing’ competition with fellow players and was seen embracing an ex-girlfriend. He was later reinstated to the team and had his fine reduced because he could not remember the drinking session and did not intentionally mislead the RFU team management . The Princess Royal's daughter and Tindall met at the 2003 Rugby World Cup in Australia. They moved in together, sharing The Bothy, on Anne's Gatcombe Park estate which was a gift from the Princess Royal, but later settled in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, before moving back to her mother's estate in January 2013. Zara has spoken about the importance of her relationship with her husband. She met him just after she found out her horse, Toytown, which she had wanted to ride in the 2008 Olympics, had become injured. ‘He met me just after I'd found out my horse had injured himself, so I was quite low and vulnerable,’ she said. ‘No, he understands the pressures, and vice versa, which obviously helps, but it actually started from becoming very good friends.’ Zara is currently 14th in line to the throne, but does not hold a royal title and is not an HRH. Their children will be plain Miss or Master Tindall.","Pair, who married in 2011, are expecting their first child in New Year .

Disgraced former Governor Eliot Spitzer choked back tears Tuesday morning as he opened up about his decision to re-enter the public sphere. Spitzer, who resigned from office five years ago after it was revealed that he solicited prostitutes, is now running for the New York City comptroller's office, and he has spent much of the past 24 hours since he announced his candidacy apologizing to voters. During an appearance on today's Morning Joe, Spitzer said he has reflected and grown since his fall from grace. 'You go through that pain, you change,' Spitzer said, getting visibly choked up. WATCH THE VIDEO HERE . Emotional moment: Eliot Spitzer's voice rattled slightly when he talked about the pain he and his family have gone through over the past five years after he resigned as Governor of New York . Spitzer announced that he would be running for the position-effectively the city's financial manager- late Sunday and made his first public appearance on Monday where he was swarmed by a mob of journalists. He gave several interviews on Monday, but his first truly emotional moment came at the end of his Morning Joe appearance. 'I failed, I had flaws, made horrific judgements, was unfaithful to my family, to the electorate- that's why I resigned. I stood up and I said I'm holding myself accountable,' he said during the segment. 'In those five years, I've reflected, I have thought, I've taught, I've written, I've done a multitude of things- run our family business- and I now think after five years- a lengthy period of time- and I can go to the public and say ""Look at the totality of who I am.""' Back in the public eye: Before he resigned, Spitzer was known as the 'Sheriff of Wall Street' because of his tough stance against banks and the role of City comptroller would have him dealing with them extensively . Though he opened the interview saying he was 'mystified' by the press attention that his involvement with prostitutes, much of the interview was dedicated to questions of whether New Yorkers could trust him again after he admitted to breaking a number of laws. 'I am ready to take the incoming missiles, some of them are hitting- I understand that. I've spent five years thinking, apologizing. I'm ready to ask for forgiveness. It's not easy, I'm ready to ask,' he said. Women of his past: Ashley Dupre (left) is the prostitute who met with Spitzer, and Kristin Davis (right) was allegedly the madam who arranged the trysts and she now says she will run against him for comptroller . Support: His wife Silda stood by his side when he announced that he would resign in 2008 following the scandal . Out and about: Silda was not spotted alongside her husband on Monday but she has attended a number of New York charity and society functions lately . He said that one of the toughest parts of . the resignation was looking his 'family in the eye' and though he did . not address them specifically this morning, he previously said that he . discussed the run with his wife Silda and their three daughters before . launching his bid. Some critics said that the show of emotion seemed contrived- and noted that there were no actual tears- but co-host Mika Brzezinski sided with the former governor. 'He was raw and all there. It was pretty powerful. Don’t know if it’ll change things for him, but I do appreciate a person who’s made mistakes coming and facing the cameras and facing the questions. That’s actually a test of character,' she told Politico. His choice to appear on Morning Joe, the daily political and economic news show aired on MSNBC, as opposed to a local news program may not help him in his immediate agenda. In order to actually qualify for the position, Spitzer must collect 4,000 signatures by Thursday in order to qualify for the race. His direct competition is Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer, a Democrat who was initially expected to run for Mayor but opted for the more financially-focused role. Taking the insults: The former governor was met with some shouts from hecklers when he went to Union Square on Monday in his first public appearance since announcing his bid . While he has the attention of the media, his first real goal is to connect with voters as he has to gather at least 4,000 signatures by Thursday from residents who support his campaign in order to run .","The former Governor now hopes to become the New York City comptroller .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 14:36 EST, 9 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:42 EST, 9 July 2013 . Punishment: Annie George, 41, was sentenced to five years' probation and forfeiture of her 20,000-square-foot mansion . An hotelier's widow in upstate New York has been sentenced to five years' probation, including eight months of home confinement, for keeping an Indian servant in the country illegally. Annie George, 41, was convicted in March of harboring an illegal alien at her stone mansion in rural Rexford, 15 miles northwest of Albany. She was acquitted of treating the woman as a slave for financial gain, although prosecutors alleged George owed Valsamma Mathai $317,000 for 5 1/2 years of work while Mathai said she was paid only $26,000 that was mostly sent to her family in India. A federal judge in Albany also ordered the widow to forfeit the 20,000-square-foot mansion as a financial penalty. Defense attorney Mark Sacco says he'll file notice of appeal, which will halt the mansion seizure. He says authorities estimated its value at $1.9million and his client owns about 10 per cent. George had faced a possible penalty of up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine at sentencing Tuesday. The George family had employed Mathai as a live-in maid at their suburban 26-room Llenroc estate for more than five years. During her sentencing, Judge Gary Sharpe lambasted George for lying about her association with Mathai when she testified in her own defense last March. 'You tried to hoodwink that jury!' Sharpe told the defendant after noting that her case ‘is not the crime of the century.’ The judge imposed a harsher sentence on the 41-year-old woman than either defense or prosecutors requested. Lucky break: George had faced a possible penalty of up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, but she was acquitted of enslaving her maid for financial gain . George’ defense attorney said that the issue of truthful testimony came from a garbled tape with different voices on it, produced by the maid's son in India, and George denied it was her voice. According to Sacco, his client, didn't initially hire the maid and was left with the situation after her husband and oldest son died in a 2009 plane crash. George was to begin serving the home confinement sentence immediately, Sacco said, and the mansion seizure will be halted during the appeal process. Federal prosecutors recommended eight months of home detention, 200 hours of community service, two years of probation and a $20,000 fine. Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Belliss in court papers said George deserved a harsher penalty under federal guidelines than the defense sought because she tried to obstruct investigators in 2011. While knowing her servant was in the U.S. illegally, George kept her even after her husband died because it was convenient and probably cheaper than hiring someone legally, he wrote.Sharpe agreed, saying the obstruction also reflected trial testimony. During the trial, Mathai had testified that she slept in a closet, worked 17-hour days without vacation, days off or sick time and wasn't allowed to leave the property, a palatial stone mansion on a cliff overlooking the Mohawk River. The case surfaced when Mathai's son in India, Shiju Mathai, called the National Human Trafficking Resources Center in 2011. In March, George testified that the tape recording of a phone call between a woman and Shiju Mathai wasn't her voice. On the call, the woman warns Shiju there could be dire consequences, even jail time, for his mother if she was to tell authorities about working in the United States. Palatial home: V.M. worked in the George family's more than 20,000-square-foot stone mansion called Llenroc, 15 miles northwest of Albany . 'If she says that she's working here, that's a big problem,' George told the son, according to Belliss. 'They'll put her in jail for sure.' At another point, George allegedly said: 'All it took was one person to say something and look what has happened now.' The widow testified that she was left in desperate financial straits when her husband died in 2009. She said she knew nothing of his . business dealings, including the arrangement to have Mathai live with . them, because he required her to stick to her duties as his wife and . mother of their six children and severely punished her if she tried to . make any decisions in the home. Her late husband, Mathai George, was a . native of India who built a hotel and real estate development business . in the United States. Deal gone awry: The woman hired in 2006 to work for the Georges as a live-in domestic servant for $1,000 a month . He was killed in 2009 along with his 11-year-old son and another man when their private plane crashed after takeoff. In his closing arguments during the trial, Sacco said Annie George deferred to her husband on all decisions. 'The government is prosecuting Annie George because Mathai George isn't here,' Sacco said. He suggested Shiju Mathai launched the . investigation because he was unhappy that his mother was sending less . money home after Mathai George died. But Assistant U.S. Attorney Belliss said Mrs George was an intelligent woman with a graduate . degree in pharmacy who, even if she didn't directly know Valsamma . Mathai's immigration status, was smart enough to figure it out. Belliss said Annie George even took Valsamma to an immigration lawyer once, a charge George denied. Valsamma Mathai came to the United . States legally on a visa after her husband died of cancer, leaving her . the sole provider for her two sons and ailing mother. When she left the . original family she was illegal because it violated the terms of the . visa, Belliss said. Several friends of Annie George said . when they visited it appeared Valsamma Mathai was a member of the family . rather than a servant, and George's children called her grandmother.","Annie George, 41, sentenced to five years' probation, eights months of home confinement .

Most people keep love letters as a reminder of the sweet nothings they shared. But one couple have a slightly different memento of their relationship - a contract agreeing that she will be his mistress in exchange for him paying for her home and income. And now the unusual - but at least organised - contract, along with recordings she made of their conversations spanning their 30-year affair, is being brought to the West End. The real-life anonymous couple - she is 88 and he is now 93 - live in separate houses in the same city on America's west coast. In exchange for 'mistress services', including 'All sexual acts as requested, with suspension of historical, emotional, psychological disclaimers,' he has provided her with a comfortable life. The unconventional pair first met at university but drifted apart, before meeting again 20 years later. They then embarked on the affair after she drew up 'The Mistress Contract', agreeing that for the duration of the Agreement, she would become his sexual property. Part of the contract, which was neatly typed out, involves him keeping his mistress in 'tasteful accommodations to her liking together with expenses accrued in the normal course of her activities'. In return she would, along with sexual acts, provide him with companionship when he was in the area'. Upon receipt of the document - which she faxed to him - he phoned her immediately to accept. London's Royal Court Theatre will host the play, which is based on an unusual 30-year contract . Their business and pleasure relationship has now formed the plot of a play written by Abi Morgan, the British screenwriter behind the Margaret Thatcher biopic The Iron Lady. The woman describes herself as a highly educated, intelligent woman with a history of involvement in the feminist movement, the Royal Court, where the play will be performed, said. She and her wealthy lover taped their conversations about their relationship while they ate, laid in bed and travelled. The pair anonymously penned a book called The Mistress Contract, only signing themselves as She and He. Their identities have understandably remained shrouded in mystery, as many question the nature of the relationship. In the opening lines of the book, one transcribed conversation records him heaping praise on her 'audacity' and 'sheer genius' of having him sign the contract, which he says 'makes him fall in love with (her) all over again' whenever he remembers it. Their recorded conversations cover each others views on the other's personality, criticisms, spats, loving words and sex. The Mistress Contract is Abi Morgan's debut at London's Royal Court Theatre. Her television credits include BBC2's The Hour and BBC 1's Birdsong, while her theatre credits include Lovesong, performed at the Lyric Hammersmith in London. Artistic Director of the Royal Court Vicky Featherstone will direct the astonishing play, which opens in January next year.","The couple live separately in the same city on America's west coast .

German Wimbledon loser Sabine Lisicki has suffered a double blow - her 18 month affair with an Olympic swimmer is over. Sabine, 23, who is known in Germany as 'Doris Becker' in homage to her own talents and Wimbledon legend Boris Becker, lost in straight sets in the women's final on Saturday to Marion Bartoli of France. Her boyfriend Benjamin Starke was not there to witness it - he stayed at home in Berlin telling friends he did not want to become involved in the 'Wimbledon circus.' Now Sabine has told a TV interviewer: 'I don't like to talk about my private life. But I can only say that it no longer exists at the moment.' It is unclear exactly when the split occurred. Sabine, who wept on the centre court as she was trounced in the final, is not shedding any tears over the break-up with Starke. Their love-affair began in December 2011 when both were hit by injuries and spent weeks together in a rehab centre in Germany. But they were seldom seen together in public. Even when they both attended an ice-hockey match they sat apart to avoid the media's attention. Lisicki did most of her training in Florida while her boy-friend spent most of his time in Berlin - too far apart, said pals, for the love affair to work. Now Sabine, currently No 18 in the world ratings, wants to concentrate only on her tennis. 'I want to be the world's Number one,' she told the TV interviewer. The German swimming star and the tennis wunderkind have been an item since last year but are intensely private.  No photos of them smooching in public, dining or dancing have ever been taken. She used to stay with him in his . apartment in the Mitte district of Berlin when over from Florida.  When . they were an item they liked watching the Berlin ice hockey team Polar . Bears at home games. He . competed at the Olympic Games in London last year and she was there to . cheer him on, but despite winning a silver and a bronze at Rome and . Shanghai in recent years, he didn't bag any medals. Couple: Olympic swimmer Benjamin Starke and Sabine Lisicki had been an item since 2011 but they were rarely pictured together . Known as a 'funster' and a 'live wire', Sabine has suffered many injuries in recent years that has held her career back. She began playing as a teenager in her . home town of Troisdorf, near Bonn, when she was seven and moved when . she was 10 to Berlin with her parents Richard - a sports scientist and . her trainer - and mother Elizabeth, an artist. She . credits her with passing on to her her 'creative talents' as she has . designed some of the outfits she wore at Wimbledon and other . tournaments.

Tears: Miss Lisicki wipes her eyes as she clutches the runner-up trophy after losing to Marion Bartoli in Saturday's Wimbledon final . Neither Richard or Elizabeth were pushy parents, leaving it up to her to decide if tennis was to be a career choice for her. 'All this happened voluntarily,' she said.  'I had to even beg my dad to give me some time to play when I was growing up.'

One of the self-proclaimed ‘happy hookers’ was sobbing outside of court after finding out that her ‘husband’ and his father were sentenced to three to nine years in prison. ‘I loved him. I just wanted him home,’ said Desiree Ellis, one of the three prostitutes who testified on behalf of their father-son pair of pimps. Vincent George Sr. and his son Vincent George Jr. were found guilty last month of money laundering and promoting prostitution but acquitted of more serious sex-trafficking charges, and their matching prison sentences were handed down. Sobbing: Desiree Ellis, a self-proclaimed prostitute, cries outside of a Manhattan court on Monday after her two pimps were told of their matching three to nine year sentences . Emotional: Ellis is one of three prostitutes who called themselves 'happy hookers' that worked for Vincent George Sr and Vincent George Jr . Sentenced: Vincent George Jr (left) and his father Vincent George Sr (right) were found guilty of money laundering and promoting prostitution but not the more serious sex trafficking charge they faced . Judge Ruth Pickholtz announced the sentence on Monday without elaboration, and the defendants showed no strong reaction. But Ms Ellis, an admitted prostitute who was a defense witness, openly wept as she sat in the audience. Before hearing the sentence, the jailed Vincent George Jr. apologized to Ellis and other women 'for not being there for them' since his arrest last year and for 'wasting the court's time.' His father declined to speak, but prosecutors said that in pre-sentence interviews, both men refused to take responsibility for their crimes. At trial, prosecutors alleged that George Sr., 56, and his son, 35, had used both threats of violence and false promises of riches to turn troubled women into virtual sex slaves. Tears for her 'family': Desiree Ellis, seen left when the Georges were found guilty on June 19 and right on Monday, was said to be sobbing outside of court on July 8 when they were sentenced . 'Happy hookers': Self-proclaimed prostitutes Danielle Geissler (left), Heather Keith (center) and Desiree Ellis (right) have testified in defense of their alleged pimps, a father-and-son duo . The defense argued their clients were exercising free will, calling them 'happy hookers.' The prostitutes made as much as $500,000 a year for the Georges but got only a few dollars a night themselves and had no bank accounts or property, prosecutors said. Evidence show that the pimps laundered millions of dollars through music recording and car service businesses. The Georges warned their prostitutes they would be beaten if they didn't bring in as much money as expected or were late to check in, according to wiretap conversations played at trial. The women painted a different picture, saying they were treated to nice cars, vacations in Florida and affection from their pimps. Some lived together as 'family' in a . house in Allentown, Pennsylvania, about 90 miles from New York, and . drove in to the city at night to turn tricks for $300, they said. On the witness stand, the 24-year-old Ellis dismissed allegations that George Jr. abused her, calling him a 'teddy bear.' She once thought about leaving him. But once at a bus station, she changed her mind and asked if she could . come back to their 'family.' He welcomed her with open arms. Keeping it classy: Geissler, dressed in a conservative tan pantsuit accessorized with a large cross dangling from her neck, described Vincent George Jr as her sweetheart and 'daddy,' and said that she was in love with him . Carrying on: Heather Keith, who is eight months pregnant with another man's child, also defended the two men for whom she worked. She had the younger George's street name tattooed on her neck . No complaints: Desiree Ellis (seen here when she testified on the pair's behalf earlier in the trial) called Vincent Sr. a 'teddy bear' and was seen sobbing outside of court . 'We kissed,' she said. 'We made up. We had a love session.' Another self-proclaimed hooker, Heather Keith, has . Vincent George Jr.'s nickname, King Koby, tattooed on her neck. She . testified she was a drug-addicted 19-year-old stripper from upstate. He . moved her to Allentown and helped her beat a cocaine habit, she said. 'I would say that I make my own choices,' said Keith, now 26. 'I am not a dumb person.

Hundreds of wild horses have been rounded up and wrestled to the ground as part of a 400-year-old Spanish festival. The Rapa Das Bestas, translated as Shearing Of The Beasts, sees horses herded down from the mountains in northwestern Spain to be trimmed and groomed. Thousands of visitors descended on the small village of Sabucedo this weekend and endured temperatures of almost 40C to witness the traditional spectacle. Battle: Aloitadores, or 'fighters' struggle to hold onto a wild horse during the Rapa Das Bestas . Herd: 500 horses were herded down from the Galicia mountains to be trimmed in the 400-year-old festival . Dangerous: One of the local fighters risks being trampled as he wrestles a horse to the ground . Spectacle: Thousands of people attended the three-day festival as 'fighters' wrestled with wild horses . The festival, which has attracted . criticism from animal rights campaigners in the past, began as a way of . checking the horses for disease and cutting their hair to keep them cool . in the hottest months. But it has turned into a tradition that now attracts thousands of people to the small village, about 40kms from Santiago de Compostela. The horses come from the mountains of Galicia, where they roam free for the rest of the year. Over three days, about 30 local Aloitadores, or 'fighters', must do battle with the horses using nothing but their hands. No tools or ropes are permitted. Tourist attraction: Thousands of people descend on the small village of Sabucedo to see the spectacle . Criticism: The festival, known as Shearing Of The Beasts, has been criticised in the past by animal rights campaigners but locals say it still serves a practical purpose to check on the health of the horses . Struggle: Three Aloitadores team up together to wrestle a horse to the ground where it is trimmed . Branded: As well as the trim, foals are also branded during the three-day festival . Family event: A woman and a young boy grab a foal during the Rapa Das Bestas . Three men are needed for each horse. One jumps on the horse's back while another takes hold of its neck. The . third grabs the tail. They then risk being trampled or crushed as they  wrestle the horse to floor in order to shear it and trim its mane and tail. Younger horses that have not previously been tagged are also branded. The festival begins on the first . Saturday in July, and starts with an early morning mass, prior to the . herders heading off at 7am, and goes on into the Monday. Tradition: The festival is 400-years-old and always takes place on the first weekend in July . Trim: Once on the ground, the horses have their mane and tails cut to keep them cool in the hot summer . Herd: Once the festival is over the horses are taken back to the mountains where they roam free . This year, 500 horses will be sheared - more than the 350 involved in the 2012 festival - before being herded back to the mountains today. Organisers delayed the start of yesterday's event as temperatures soared because of fears about the health of the horses and the fighters. In 2007, the festival was declared a Fiesta of International Tourist Interest by the Spanish General Secretariat of Tourism.","500 horses trimmed during The Rapa Das Bestas in northwestern Spain .

Phyllis Cook walked down the aisle in a smart skirt and blouse to tie the knot with groom John Plommer, 86. Phyllis thought her last hope of ever getting hitched disappeared when her lifelong fiance died in 2008. To have but not too old: John Plommer, 86, and never-before-married Phyllis Cook, 85, tied the knot at a small ceremony . The couple never married because their parents had originally frowned on their romance. But she moved into sheltered accommodation a year ago after a tumble at home - and found herself falling for fellow resident John. The retired farmer had been married twice before but his second wife died a year ago. The old romantics soon became close friends and last Christmas grandad John asked Phyllis to a date. Two months later they became engaged and they have now got married in front of 23 delighted guests. True love: The pair have only known each other a year, having met when they moved into Mulberry Court retirement housing on the same day last June . Phyllis walked unaccompanied down the aisle at St Mildred's Church, Canterbury last Friday. To her surprise and delight her sister Yvonne Lane flew over from Canada for the occasion. The newlyweds, who live in the same sheltered housing in Canterbury, are now on honeymoon in Wales . But before leaving overjoyed Phyllis, a retired administrator, said: 'It was a nice service. 'We had as many friends there as we could get in the church. 'We're not 21 years old but we've both made friends with everyone where we live.' John said: 'I lost my second wife in March 2012 and I couldn't look after our bungalow and garden on my own so I found a flat here. 'Phyllis and I just help each other out. 'We saw in the new year together and from there she has spent most of the daylight hours with me in my flat. 'I hope our marriage will bring friendship, happiness and companionship.' He added: 'Not everyone wants to get married again but we are helping each other.' The wedding guests also included John's son Geoff, 48, and his wife Diane and their children Damien and Kyle.

The family of a young disabled girl were shocked and angered when they were told their daughter wouldn’t be able to access a museum because her wheelchair would ‘get the carpets dirty.’ Lexi Hass, 11, from Charlotte, North Carolina suffers from a rare neurological condition called Kernicterus that has left her physically non-functional. She and her family spent the weekend in Savannah, Georgia and had planned to visit the Ships of the Sea Museum on Sunday but were told they wouldn’t be able to bring Lexi’s wheelchair into the museum. Lexi Hass was refused entry to the Ships of the Sea Museum in Savannah, Georgia because of concerns that her wheelchair would spoil their carpets . The Ships of the Sea Museum in Savannah, Georgia is housed in an old building, but that isn't the reason that Lexi was refused entry . Lexi’s father Dr. Stephen Haas told WBTV that he thought it might be difficult for his daughter to visit the museum because it is housed in a historic building, but he said the reason given ‘didn’t make any sense’. The family were told they couldn't bring in Lexi’s almost brand new wheelchair because it would get dirty the carpets. When Lexi’s father pointed out that the wheelchair was no dirtier than his shoes, he was told his daughter could use a wheelchair that the museum owns. ‘Apparently the Ships and Sea Museum in Savannah Georgia has a policy that wheelchairs from the outside are not allowed on the carpet but shoes are allowed,’ the family posted on Lexi’s Facebook page. Lexi suffers from Kernicterus, a rare neurological condition that has left her physically non-functional . That wasn’t a viable option for the Haas family as Lexi’s wheelchair has special straps because she can't sit up on her own. The museum then suggested that Lexi could sit outside and watch a video while the rest of her family walked through the exhibit. ‘They really need to train their staff. They really do. It's a significant error and significant departure in the current thinking on disability access,’ Lexi's mother Susan Haas told WBTV. The family decided not to enter and have since received an apology email from the museum's director, and accepted that apology. Lexi's mom Susan has said the museum needs to train their staff better, while father Dr. Stephen Hass said the reason given for not accepting his daughter 'didn't make any sense' They aren't looking to file an Americans with Disabilities Act complaint, but just want to make it clear that this type of thing is not acceptable. Museum curator Wendy Melton has blamed the mix-up on an employee who misunderstood the museum's wheelchair policy. She said she has spoken with the employee and made the policy clear for the future. Lexi was angry about not visiting the museum as she enjoys learning, but her parents took her for ice cream instead and enjoyed the rest of her stay in Savanna.","Lexi Hass, 11, suffers from a rare neurological condition .

A baby raccoon dog was confused for a bear cub and taken in by local police in Shanghai, China. The mix-up was not discovered until an officer posted pictured of the cub online wearing a miniature police uniform. What a coon-artist! This baby raccoon dog was mistaken for a bear cub and taken in by police in Shanghai . Undercover officer: The case of mistaken identity was discovered after these adorable pictured were posted on Chinese microblogging site Weibo by one of the officers at the police station . Bear-ly: After a closer look, it becomes clear that the little raccoon dog definitely isn't related to a bear . Shanghai Police found the ‘bear cub’ when they responded to a call from a local man who reported that he had discovered a bear cub in his back garden, police officer Li Wenyue said. Liu went and collected the bear and made a temporary home for it in a shoebox at the police station. After posting the pictures online, she was contacted by a person from the local forestry department who told her that the ‘cub’ was actually a baby raccoon dog. The youngster has since been taken in by the forestry department who will release it back into the wild once it is old enough. The raccoon dog has been given its name due to its close resemblance to the common raccoon but is in fact a species of dog and is not closely related to the raccoon, but rather to the fox. Far-fetched claim: The raccoon dog is closer related to dogs and foxes than bears . Saved: Fortunately for this little rascal, he will be released back into the wild, unlike the 1.5 million raccoon dogs bread for fur in China every year . It is commonly used in the Chinese fur trade, known for skinning raccoon dogs alive, where it is called ‘murmansky fur’. A 2005 investigation found that approximately 1.5 million raccoon dogs are raised for fur in China at any given time. There have been calls for the banning of using raccoon dogs for fur after several incidents of international retailers mislabeling raccoon dog fur as fake. In 2006 several American designers were discovered to be selling raccoon dog fur under fake labels, including Jay-Z's label Rocawear, P-Diddy's Sean John and retailer Macy's, who all pulled the garments.","Shanghai police responded to a distress call over a 'bear cub' in a garden .

Britain is at the centre of a fresh spying scandal today after its agents apparently intercepted phone calls and monitored the computers of foreign officials at two major meetings held in London. It is alleged the UK's secret services even tricked delegates into using internet cafes they had set up at the 2009 G20 summits to allow British intelligence agencies to easily read their emails. GCHQ documents seen by the Guardian, labelled top secret, even bragged about the 'successes' of spying at G20, and named at least two targets of the spying - long-standing allies Turkey and South Africa. A large number of smartphones and BlackBerrys were tapped to harvest confidential calls, emails and documents, which 'provided timely information to UK ministers', according to confidential slides leaked by US whistleblower Edward Snowden. The embarrassing news comes as Britain . prepares to host a G8 summit for nations which were all present - and . spied upon - in 2009. Keeping a close watch: World leaders pictured at the G20 summit in April 2009. The Guardian has reported that GCHQ spied on foreign representatives while they were in the UK . It raises new questions about the boundaries of surveillance by GCHQ, the UK intelligence agency, and its US sister organisation, the National Security Agency. Ministers say access to phone records and internet data is necessary in the fight against terrorism and serious crime. The 2009 spying appears to have been organised for a less important purpose - securing an advantage in meetings. Secrets: The data about the apparent British spying is alleged to have come from Edward Snowden. a former technical assistant for the CIA who has fled to Hong Kong . Eavesdropping: GCHQ, Britain's electronic listening agency, mounted an intensive spying operation on foreign politicians attending two G20 summit meetings in London in 2009, it has been reported . During G20 meetings in April and September 2009, GCHQ used what one document calls ‘ground-breaking intelligence capabilities’ to intercept the communications of visiting delegations. This included setting up internet cafes where they used an email interception programme and key-logging software to spy on delegates’ use of computers; and penetrating the security on delegates’ BlackBerrys to monitor their email messages and phone calls. Other moves also include supplying 45 . analysts with a live round-the-clock summary of who was phoning who at . the summit; and targeting the Turkish finance minister and possibly 15 . others in his party. Embarrassing: As Barack Obama arrives with his family for G8 today, details of the spying at previous G20 summits emerged . The . documents suggest that the operation was sanctioned in principle at a . senior level in the government of Gordon Brown, the then prime minister - . and that intelligence, including briefings for visiting delegates, was . passed to British ministers. An . outline of the objectives of 'spying' on delegates written by GCHQ . director Sir Iain Lobban was handed out to officials, according to The . Guardian. One report seen . by the newspaper explains the efforts that NSA specialists working at . Menwith Hill in North Yorkshire went to to decode encrypted telephone . calls by Russian president Dmitry Medvedev. Powerful: G20 leaders including US President Barack Obama, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev were at the summit at the Excel Centre in London . Summit: Spanish Prime Minister Jose Zapatero (left), German Chancellor, Angela Merkel (centre) and her Finance Minister, Peer Steinbruck during the round table session at the G20 London Summit in April 2009 . In a September meeting of G20 finance ministers GCHQ details of intercepted calls were displayed on a giant screen of the organisation's operations centre as well as to individual officials' screens. That information was then quickly passed on to UK delegates at the summit to provide them information to use for negotiations. Officials were also able to get hold of advanced copies of G20 briefings to ministers by bypassing BlackBerry security. GCHQ was able to spy on the foreign diplomats under the 1994 Intelligence Services Act (ISA) which allows Britain's security services to conduct such operations with ministerial authority. Important: Then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown made the summit a top strategic priority . The law includes a clause which says that agencies should operate 'in the interests of economic wellbeing of the UK'. The ISA was greeted with great suspicion by European countries when it came into force because countries were concerned that British companies would have access to intelligence that would give them a competitive edge over rival foreign firms. It is not clear whether ISA was specifically invoked for the G20 meetings but then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown had made the summit a strategic priority so it was likely that it had.","Series of 'top secret' slides reveals level of British spying at 2009 summits .

Moyes believes Rooney can still become a United ‘legend’ if puts the turmoil of the past few months behind him and signs a new contract. He said: ‘I think if I was Wayne, you would look at the legends who have played at this club. You see their pictures at the training ground - George Best, Bobby Charlton, Roy Keane, I could go on. And I thought to myself, Wayne is not too far away from that. It isn't too difficult to get the goals and if he could do that, he would be seen in the same light as those people. ‘What we're looking to do is see how we can get Wayne Rooney scoring those goals, which will challenge the likes of Bobby Charlton and Denis Law's numbers. ‘We are working and trying everything to get Wayne to the level where we think he should be. Not only that, this country will have a World Cup to play in next year, so for everybody’s benefit, we are trying to get him back to the Wayne Rooney we all know.’ Moyes, 50, has joined United on a six-year contract after 11 years at Everton. Getting to know you: Moyes in the Old Trafford dug out . He revealed that Ferguson invited him to his house in Cheshire and effectively told him that he would be his successor. ‘It was a strange situation,’ he added. ‘I had no idea whatsoever. I knew nothing until ir Alex Ferguson gave me a call and asked me to come to his house. I was expecting him to say he was taking one of my players at Everton. ‘But the first thing he said was “I’m retiring”. I asked when and he said “next week!”. His next words were, “You’re the next Manchester United manager”. I didn’t get a chance to say yes or no. I was told I was the next United manager and that was enough. ‘I was incredibly privileged but it was more shock. The blood drained from my face. But I always hoped I would be a consideration.’ Moyes acknowledged the challenge he . faces to maintain the success Ferguson brought to Old Trafford, and . admitted that it will e impossible to replicate. But . he insisted that he will do things his own way and not be intimidated . by his fellow Scot staying on as a director and club ambassador. ‘I’m . looking forward to him sitting behind me in the director’s box,’ said . Moyes. ‘I’ve got to say he is someone I will use for advice. Topic of conversation: Wayne Rooney was the main talking point at the press conference . The journey begins: Moyes poses with assistant manager Steve Round (left) and coach Jimmy Lumsden (right) ‘Sir Alex Ferguson will never go away. His statue his here and his name is on the stand. It is impossible to match him and do it for 26 years at this level. I don’t think there will be another manager who will do it for that long. His achievements means there are no better. 'Time will tell on the future. Any . football manager wants to manage here. All I can do is what David Moyes . has done before. I will definitely continue the traditions of Manchester . United but put my own stamp on the club. ‘I . am fortunate to take over champions of England. Success is tattooed . across badge of this club. This job is about winning trophies and it is . something I am wanting to do. It will not change me, I’m determined to . try to get the first one on the board. ‘I am inexperienced in a lot of . things. There are some brilliant managers who could have taken this role . but the biggest confidence I can take is Sir Alex Ferguson telling me . he wanted me for this role. ‘I hope he is sitting in the directors box. I have already called him two or three times for some advice.’ Big arrival: David Moyes arriving at Carrington ahead of his press conference . Meet and greet: Moyes meets more staff on his first day as Manchester United manager at Carrington . Settling in: Moyes gets to grips with his surroundings earlier in the week . Moyes added Ryan Giggs and Phil Neville to his coaching staff on Thursday, and said he hopes to bring Paul Scholes back to the club in some capacity in the future following his retirement at the end of last season. He would not expand on United’s pursuit of Barcelona midfielder Thiago Alcantara and his old Everton defender Leighton Baines, admitting that some deals may not be in place before the team leaves for a pre-season tour of Australia and Asia on Wednesday. Targets? Moyes admitted he hopes to bring in a couple of players before their pre-season tour. Thiago Alcantara (left) and Leighton Baines have been heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford . ‘I will try to have players in before the tour but I would not like to say yes,’ he said. ‘The way the transfer window is things might be done later. Not everything will be done straightaway. ‘I would never speak about players at other clubs. I would try to answer as many questions as I can. This club is always interested in the best players. ‘I’ve only been the manager since July 1. This club will always go for the best players and will always go for the best young players. ‘We tried to introduce players at Everton the best we could, and it’s in the DNA here to bring in our own players from the youth set-up.’ Moyes admitted that he could not remember United having to face a tougher start, with the champions facing Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool in their first five games. New look: Phil Neville and Ryan Giggs have joined Moyes as United's backroom staff gets a reshuffle . But he welcomed the return of Jose Mourinho at Chelsea and the challenge of Manuel Pellegrini’s arrival at City. ‘I think there will be improvements from all the clubs,’ he added. ‘I’m pleased to see Jose back and we will enjoy having him back. ‘I have come across Pellegrini before and it will be new to him. There has been a big shake-up and there is a lot of things unknown, not just at this club but a few others. ‘I think the priority is doing well in all the competitions. We have to go for everything, you attempt to win everything. I’ve done it everywhere else I’ve been. ‘We will play exciting football, the way Manchester United play – but the biggest thing is to win. ‘I would always put winning at the top of the list and I’m sure Sir Alex Ferguson would as well. If you have an entertaining team and don’t win then you’re not going anywhere.’ Big shoes: Moyes has to follow in the footsteps of, arguably, Britain's best ever manager .

A three-week old kitten survived a 1,000 mile journey across two US states inside the engine of a car. The cat was only discovered after the driver heard it meowing while driving from Oregon to California. Police were called but were unable to find it and the kitten was eventually freed by an animal rescue charity after being trapped for two to three days. Scroll down for video . The kitten survived a two-day 1,000 mile journey across two US states before being rescued . Speaking to ABC News, Julia Di Sieno, the founder of Animal Rescue Team, Inc., said the car's owner first called her last week. She said: 'She heard the kitten crying before she departed and there was nothing she could do. She tried to find the kitten. So they continued on their journey, driving south.' But the owner called her again the following day to say she thought the kitten, a stray, was trapped somewhere in the car. Miss Di Sieno said she asked the owner to call the Santa Barbara police department and ask them to call animal control. The kitten is thought to have been trapped inside the engine compartment for two to three days . The driver heard the kitten - a stray - meowing while driving 1,000 miles from Oregon to California . The cat was only discovered after the driver heard it meowing while driving from Oregon to California . She added: 'Animal control was dispatched, an officer showed up, and he thought perhaps the kitten was no longer in the compartment.' But that afternoon Miss Di Sieno got another call saying she could still hear the cat meowing. Miss Di Sieno added: 'I had to go do something.' She drove to meet the owner. At first, they struggled to find the kitten - even after they had lifted up the car to look underneath with the help of a tow truck company - but then found it hidden away in the silver Honda Fit's engine compartment. She managed to sedate the cat with a 'jab stick' and was then able to manouevre it out of the engine. Miss Di Sieno said: 'I was concerned about this kitten because it had been in the car engine for two to three days. 'I put on latex gloves, and I managed to get my hands in there until I had a little kitten and wiggled it through.' The rescuers managed to remove the kitten by sedating it and then pulling it out carefully . The kitten, which was dehydrated and had an infected eye, is now expected to make a full recovery . Miss Di Sieno then took the kitten, who was dehydrated and had an infected eye, home to give it treatment. It is now expected to make a full recovery. Miss Di Sieno added: 'He is very tame now, purring, and finally eating. We’ve been treating him with antibiotics.' Miss Di Sieno has been saving animals for more than 29 years at Animal Rescue Team, Inc., sustained solely by donations. She has rescued lions, bears and other large mammals, but she said this was the first time she’s rescued a kitten from an engine. She said: 'It was refreshing for me because I’m passionate about this work and saving animals. The moment I pulled him up, it was so exhilarating.' She added that, for a lost kitten, an engine is a perfect small, tight compartment to seek warmth, especially if it was in a climate such as Oregon. The cat has now been named 'Love' after the owner of the tow truck company, who helped free the kitten without asking for payment.","Kitten survives 1,000 mile journey inside the engine of a Honda Fit .

Within hours of his arrival in his native Jordan, lawyers for the terror suspect said they would file legal papers today asking for him to be released. Qatada, 53, grinned broadly as he was driven to a maximum-security prison following a two-hour interrogation inside Jordan’s State Security Court. Radical Islamist cleric Abu Qatada's lawyers said that they will file papers for his immediate release . Surrounded by anti-terrorism officers in a convoy of vehicles which included jeeps mounted with anti-aircraft machine guns, the fundamentalist appeared delighted by his latest legal ploy. He told his family he was ‘happy’ to be in Jordan, saying: ‘The UK is not my country and I never looked for comfort there. I came back to Jordan on my own wish and I’m happy I’ve come back to my family and loved ones.’ Qatada was taken to the State Security Court compound where he was allowed a 15-minute reunion with his father and three brothers. His family left the courthouse proclaiming his innocence and their belief that he would be free within a week. Mahmoud Othman Omar, the father of Abu Qatada, said that he believes his son is innocent . The family of the radical preacher, centre, leave the Jordanian military court. A Jordanian military prosecutor says he has charged a radical Muslim preacher with conspiring to carry out al-Qaida-linked attacks on Americans, Israelis and other Westerners . Father Mahmoud Othman, 84, said: ‘My son is innocent and I hope the court will set him free. They are going to release him on bail after a week. He is in high spirits.’ Brother Ibrahim, 33, a falafel seller, added: ‘We hope he’ll be out in a week.’ Witnesses said Qatada started crying when he saw his father for the first time in 22 years, and knelt to kiss his hands and feet. His brother Mohammed seized him and kissed his hand, swearing allegiance to him as his ‘Sheikh’, or leader. Qatada spent last night in a Jordanian prison, deep in the desert – a world away from his family’s taxpayer-funded four-bedroom home in the suburbs of north-west London. Prosecutors said they expected the radical Islamist to remain at the maximum-security Muwaqqar prison for at least two weeks while he undergoes daily interrogation from lawyers and the prosecutor-general. On yer bike: Abu Qatada is finally being deported after a 10-year legal battle that has cost taxpayers around £2million . Jordanian security stand guard in front of the State Security Court, where the trial will be held, in Amman . He is accused of plotting Al Qaeda-linked terrorist bomb attacks on Western and Israeli targets in Jordan in the 1990s. Prison insiders said any contact with other inmates would be tightly controlled for fear the extremist cleric would inspire a new generation of terrorists. Qatada’s lawyer Tayseer Daib said: ‘I will appeal tomorrow to the court to release him on bail. My client is not guilty.’ If he gets bail, he would live in his parents’ home in downtown Amman, near the family’s falafel restaurant. Abu Qatada has finally been deported from Britain after a 10-year legal battle that has cost taxpayers an estimated £2million. Qatada's plane left the airfield at about 2.45am . The Government has been trying to deport him to Jordan, where he was convicted of terror charges in his absence in 1999, for about a decade . The 53-year-old hate preacher left Belmarsh prison shortly after midnight on Sunday morning in a police convoy. He was taken to RAF Northholt, from where he was flown in a private jet to Jordan . Meanwhile, his wife and five children are to stay in their £1,400-a-month London home  to the fury of neighbours. The preacher’s family have received an estimated £500,000 in benefits since they arrived in the country in 1993. Neighbours have started a petition demanding the family is evicted, and have threatened to stop paying council tax.

After her daughter was the victim of a school hate campaign, Hayley Harker refused to let the bullies win. She promised Paige, 16, the prom of her dreams if she finished school despite the torment. And thanks to a £1,000 splurge – and the same horse-drawn carriage used by Katie Price on her wedding day – Mrs Harker has delivered on that promise. Devoted: Hayley Harker splashed out £1,000 to make her daughter's prom night perfect, after Paige endured years of bullying at school where she was verbally abused, kicked and tripped up . Cinderella moment: Ms Harker even hired the £600 horse-drawn carriage used by Katie Price on the day she married Peter Andre to take Paige to the prom - pulled by two horses . The mother-of-two, from Telford, . Shropshire, splashed out £600 on hiring the carriage, drawn by two grey . horses, as well as £240 for a custom-made dress from China.

'Sleepless nights': Ms Harker, seen with her daughter at their home in Telford, said the promise of a special prom night helped to give her daughter the strength to remain in school . Celebration: Paige wore a custom-made royal blue gown to her prom, which her mother said marked the end of 'five years of hell' for her daughter . Paige, who is ‘relieved’ to be . leaving school and looking forward to starting beauty college in . September, said: ‘When we drove through town, everyone’s heads were . turning. It was like being a celebrity. ‘I had the best time and I am so grateful that my mum paid so much for my prom.

The bullying then escalated and she . was verbally abused, tripped up and kicked on a daily basis. It became . so bad Paige was forced to miss a month of school and her mother had to . pay £2,000 for a maths tutor as she fell behind. Paige said: ‘I hated school, it was a . constant struggle. I was called names and people even tried to push me . down a flight of stairs. It was horrible.’ Mrs Harker, a hairdresser, said: ‘She . had such a awful time at school but I didn’t want her to drop out, so I . decided to try and convince her to stay with the promise of an amazing . prom. ‘It was all worth it to see  her dressed up and happy. I was welling up.’ 'I had sleepless nights on the run up to the prom - I was so worried about everything running smoothly,' Ms Harker said. 'I just wanted Paige . to have what she wanted, she deserved it and I had promised her all . year she could have an amazing prom - no expense spared,' she said. Paige's ordeal began when she first . started secondary school, and turned into a five year campaign of . bullying that saw her verbally abused, tripped up and kicked on a daily . basis. Total: £1,035 . Ms Harker said: 'She had such a awful time at school, she really hated going, but . I didn’t want her to drop out, so I decided to try and convince her to . stay with the promise of an amazing prom. 'I had the dress made for her six months before, as an incentive for Paige to stay in school.' Paige . said: 'We spent ages choosing the right material, and once we found it . we sent off a sample to a company in China, where they used my . measurements to make me an original dress, which no-one else would have. It was a perfect fit.' The strapless blue dress had eight hoops sewn into the lining of the skirt to give it extra impact. 'It was amazing, but so heavy. I was exhausted by the end of the night. Most other people had straight up and down dresses but mine was really big, and really stood out - I loved it,' the teenager said. 'The night I dreamed of': Paige, 16, says she is 'so grateful' to her mother for helping to make her night special . 'No expense spared': Single mother Ms Harker, from Telford, said she had promised her daughter the 'amazing' prom night she deserved and even organised for her blue dress to be hand-made in China . 'They even managed to match the feathers on the horses’ heads, which pulled my carriage, to the same royal blue as my dress, it was perfect. 'The carriages were different prices for black and white, but I had the exact same one as Katie Price had, the company bought it two days after her wedding. It was expensive but I knew it would be amazing. 'The carriage arrived early and all the neighbours came out to have a look and take pictures. When we drove through town, everyone’s heads were turning. It was like being a celebrity. 'On the day, the carriage arrived early and when I went outside all the neighbours had come out of their houses and gathered around to look and kids were asking for photos,' said Paige. Dream come true: Paige was whisked to her prom in the same horse-drawn carriage Katie Price travelled in on the day she married Peter Andre . Ms Harker has another daughter, four-year-old Miley, who also had a new outfit for her sister’s prom and rode in the carriage with Paige on the 30-minute journey through the town. Paige said: 'Miley will want just as big a prom as me, although she is a bit of a tomboy so probably won’t have the carriage. 'Me and my mum are very close, I tell her everything, we are the best of friends. She has really helped to fight my corner.' Ms Harker said the bullying became so bad at one stage her daughter missed a month of school. 'Paige’s face flared up with stress acne and she didn’t want anyone to see her,' she said.

One was killed and four others were injured after an explosion at a nuclear plant in one of the France's most popular tourist areas today. The blast at the vast Marcoule site, close to Bagnols-sur-Ceze, in the Gard department, immediately raised fears of an atomic disaster. Marcoule, which is used to store and melt down radioactive waste, is close to the beaches of the French Riviera and major cities including Montpellier and Marseilles. Response: A fire truck arrives at Marcoule nuclear waste treatment centre after the blast. The French nuclear watchdog insists that 'right now, there is no radioactive leak' but the fire service has refused to enter the site . But, following the explosion at around 11.45am, a spokesman for ASN, France's nuclear safety watchdog, claimed 'right now, there no radioactive leak'. Despite this, the fire service was refusing to enter the facility to assess the damage, and a safety perimeter fence had been placed around the facility. A source among the workforce at Marcoule, which has been in operation since 1956, said: 'The explosion caused the instant death of one man, while another is in a critical condition with horrific burns. 'He has been transported to hospital . in Montpellier by emergency helicopter. Another three workers are less . seriously injured, and they have been evacuated to hospital in . Bagnols-sur-Ceze.'

Marcoule was used to carry out some of the earliest plutonium experiments by French military scientists. It once housed a number of nuclear reactors, but these have been shut down. Now it contains a pressurized water reactor, with cooling for all its plants coming from the Rhone River. France produces almost 80 per cent of its electricity from nuclear power - the highest percentage in the world. EDF (Electricity of France) - the country's main electricity provider - has managed the country's 59 nuclear power plants since 2002, with potentially dangerous incidents kept to a minimum. Security: French gendarmes secure the area around Marcoule after the explosion. The site was the scene of some of the earliest experiments with plutonium by French weapons scientists .

"By . Matt Chorley and Tim Shipman . PUBLISHED: . 06:16 EST, 9 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:02 EST, 9 July 2013 . Crackdown: Labour leader Ed Miliband said it was time to limit outside earnings for MPs who earn hundreds of thousands of pounds . MPs should be banned from earning hundreds of thousands of pounds in lucrative second jobs, Ed Miliband said today. The Labour leader said there should be . a limit on the amounts politicians can earn from outside interests but . faced claims he was using the issue to deflect attention from his . failure to stand up to his union paymasters. Mr Miliband sought to get back on the . front foot after dire headlines over union dominance of the Labour . party, using financial muscle to influence policy and candidate . selection. The row erupted over claims of . criminal activity in the Labour safe seat of Falkirk, amid allegations . that people were signed up as party members by Unite without their . knowledge in order to secure the union’s preferred candidate in the . seat. In a speech in central London today, . Mr Miliband sought to reclaim the initiative by condemning Unite’s . activities in Falkirk as ‘a symbol of what is wrong with politics’. He said: ‘That was a politics closed, a politics of the machine, a politics hated – and rightly so.’ In a much-hyped speech he said he . would reform the system of affiliating union members to Labour, . introduce a code of conduct for would-be election candidates and . introduce open primary elections for Labour's next candidate for London . Mayor. But despite being heralded as the . biggest challenge to the unions’ ties to Labour, the plans were warmly . welcomed by the heads of some of Labour;s biggest trade union donors. It also emerged that the man chosen to . lead reforms of party rules is Lord Collins, a former TGWU assistant . general secretary who helped steer the union into a merger with Amicus . to create Unite – the union accused of exerting excessive influence over . Labour. In a surprise move Mr Miliband . announced it was time to end MPs earning big money outside Parliament in . as lawyers or advising the corporate world. He said it was wrong that sometimes MPs earn higher salaries from second jobs than as a Member of Parliament. Picking a fight: Mr Miliband said he wanted to change Labour's relationship with the unions . Fightback: The Labour leader used the speech at The St Bride Foundation near Fleet Street to counter claims his party is in hoc to his union paymasters . Some . 295 of the 650 MPs declared some form of income, and 20 made more money . outside Parliament than their MP's salary of £65,738. The total declared by Conservative MPs came to £4.3 million and by Labour MPs £2.4 million. The MPs to declare the most income included: . Gordon Brown (Lab) £1.37million . Stephen Phillips (Con) £740,000 . Geoffrey Cox (Con) £417,000 . Nicholas Soames (Con) £305,000 . Sir Malcolm Rifkind (Con) £276,000 . Alistair Darling (Lab) £263,000 . John Redwood (Con) £238,000 . Jack Straw (Lab) £183,000. Latest figures show MPs earned . £7million from outside jobs last year, including 20 who received more . than the MPs' standard salary of £65,738. Embarrassingly for Mr Miliband, one of . the most in demand was former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who . declared earnings of £1.4million , although he insists he does not . receive the income himself  but ‘all the money goes directly to charity . or to fund charitable work by himself and his wife’ Sarah. Mr Miliband said: 'The British people expect their MPs to be representing them and the country not anyone else. 'They understand that Members of . Parliament need to keep connected to the world beyond Westminster and . will always write articles and give speeches. 'But can it be right that the rules . allow MPs to earn hundreds of thousands of pounds from private legal . practice while they are supposed to be an MP? Or from outside . corporations without any real form of regulation? 'We will change things in the next . Parliament. That is why I believe that at the very least there should be . new limits on outside earnings, like they have in other countries. And . new rules on conflict of interests too.' He urged David Cameron and Nick Clegg to work with him to tackle the problem. But in the Commons Mr Clegg rejected the idea as an attempt to distract attention from Labour's woes over union influence. The Deputy Prime Minister said: 'I . think that what is important is that it is done in the most transparent . and accountable way possible. 'People do expect MPs to work for . their constituents. That is what we are here for and that should remain . the principle purpose of all MPs elected to this place.' In what is billed as the most . significant reform of his party for a generation, Mr Miliband said union . members will have to ‘opt in’ to hand over an annual £3 donation to . Labour, which they currently pay automatically. It has the potential to dramatically . reduce the amount of money Labour receives via union membership, but . would increase the number of fully paid-up Labour members. Mr Miliband is desperate to regain . credibility while police probe claims that members of the Unite union . conspired to fix a Labour candidate selection in Falkirk. Mixed messages: Last night Unite leader Len McCluskey denounced the 'opt-in' plans as 'unworkable' but today said he welcomed Mr Miliband;s reforms . In his speech, he called for a ‘new direction’ with the unions, even though aides conceded this may ‘take years’ to achieve. Unite leader Len McCluskey last night denounced the ‘opt-in’ plan as ‘unworkable’. But today the head of the union which has given £8.4million to Labour since Mr Miliband’s election in 2010. But today Mr McCluskey said he was . ‘very comfortable’ with Mr Miliband's proposals, which he said could . result in tens of thousands more union members joining Labour. Conservative Party Chairman Grant . Shapps said: ‘Nothing has changed.  Under Ed Miliband’s proposals, Len . McCluskey would still bankroll the Labour Party, pick Labour’s . candidates, and still elect Labour’s leader. Backing: Former Prime Minister Tony Blair said he supported the plans to curb the influence of the unions . ‘It’s still the same old Labour Party: . a weak leader in the pocket of the union bosses who’s unable to stand . up for hardworking people.’ At present, three million workers, . including shop staff, nurses and train drivers, automatically have the . cash taken from their union subscriptions, because their unions are . ‘affiliated’ to Labour. But the levy has long been the source . of resentment for some rank-and-file members, many of whom want to . belong to a union but may not support Labour. Under Mr Miliband’s plan, members would have to ‘opt in’ to the levy instead of the status quo where they are told to ‘opt out’. The plans received the support of . former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair, who admitted that he should . have made the same reforms himself when he was leader from 1994-2007. 'I think this is a defining moment, and I think it's bold and it's strong. It's real leadership,' Mr Blair told Sky News. 'I think it's important not only in . its own terms, because he's carrying through a process for reform in the . Labour Party that's long overdue. 'And, frankly, probably I should have . done it when I was leader - but at the same time, what he is doing - and . I think this is also very important for the country - is that he's . sending a very strong message to the country that in the end he'll do . what's right for all the country and not simply for one section of it. 'This is big stuff and it takes a real act of leadership to do it.' However it is unclear whether the plans would succeed in diluting union influence over Labour policy and elections. Mr Miliband is also resisting calls to . change rules on electing a Labour leader – a process in which union . members still have huge influence – or whether he will dilute their . voting power at party conference, where the unions still enjoy a 50 per . cent block vote. Under Mr Miliband's plan, members would have to 'opt in' to the levy instead of the status quo where they are told to 'opt out' It remains unclear how the opt-in plans can work without union cooperation because its officials would have to administer it. But the move was hailed by Miliband . allies last night as the most significant reform to Labour since the . party moved to one member one vote 20 years ago. But the plans are some way short of challenging Labour’s links to the unions. If, as expected, the number of union . members formally affiliated to the party via the levy drops . dramatically, union bosses could actually enjoy more power over Labour . unless the leadership and conference voting rules are changed. If the unions keep their block vote they would be able to manipulate the party by influencing just a few thousand union members. In a fresh blow, the Tories yesterday . asked Scotland Yard to launch an investigation into Unite activities in . two other seats, Lewisham Deptford and Ilford North. The full extent of Unite’s influence . over Labour was laid bare last night when a leaked document written by . the union’s political secretary revealed that the union has privately . boasted of changing Labour policies and dictated the subject of .

Spain topped the table with 19 per cent conceiving in the traditional British tourist hotspot, closely  followed by the UK, with 15 per cent becoming pregnant during a 'staycation.' A poll found that a fifth of British women conceive while on holiday. The most popular destination was Spain, closely followed by UK 'staycations' France came third, with 12 per cent saying it was where they started or added to their family, Italy came fourth with nine per cent admitting they'd become pregnant there and Portugal came fifth with seven per cent. Researchers at Hotels.com also found that celebrity conceptions are influencing holidaymakers, with five per cent saying they were inspired to travel to Singapore amid rumours the Royal baby was conceived there. 1 Spain 19%2 UK 15%3 France 12%4 Italy 9%5 Portugal 7% . Other celebrities who have affected British parents-to-be's travel choices include Victoria Beckham for Brooklyn in New York, Kim Kardashian for Rome and Beyonce for Paris. All were rumoured or admitted to having become pregnant while travelling. Surprisingly, men were more inspired to holiday in a celebrity conception destination than their female counterparts, with five per cent of men wanting to treat their partner to a Singaporean holiday, compared to only three per cent of women. Laura Watts, of Hotels.com, said: 'It's incredible to see celebrity conceptions are influential for some Brits when looking to book their next holiday - who knows where the next hotspot will be. 'We can see which destinations bring out . our amorous side, especially in men, resulting in a holiday memory that . will last a lifetime.'

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that drugs companies believe they are close to finding a cure for dementia . Scientists are edging closer to discovering a cure for dementia, according to the British Health Secretary. Jeremy Hunt has claimed that 'incredible advances' in British medicine are bringing us nearer to a treatment for the age-related brain disease. He also said that the country's 'tremendous science tradition' is crucial to securing the future of the NHS and meeting the challenges of an ageing society. Mr Hunt made the announcement at the annual conference of the Local Government Association in Manchester, according to The Telegraph. 'Finding drugs that can halt or cure dementia may seem a distant prospect now but there are drugs  companies that think they will have a cure for dementia by 2020.' He added that the UK will be the first country in the world to map 100,000 genomes and decode patients' medical history. This would unlock a 'treasure trove' of information to tackle diseases such as cancer, he explained. He went as far as to say that the project would be the medical equivalent of the invention of the internet, in terms of its significance. He later explained that societies should be judged by the way they care for their elderly residents and added that an increasingly old population should be perceived not as a 'ticking time bomb' but maybe as 'humanity's greatest triumph to date.' Mr Hunt added that with the correct care we should not see the increasing elderly population as a 'ticking time bomb' but instead 'humanity's greatest triumph to date' To achieve this, he said that local authorities and the NHS must work together to find solutions that would ensure all elderly people were treated the way that anyone would want their grandparent to be looked after. The three pillars of reform were outlined as being in contrast to the previous government's 'more targets, more pressure, more corporate objectives'. This had resulted in 'unspeakable human tragedy' such as in Mid Staffordshire. Mr Hunt concluded that in the future every patient would be given a named clinician so people knew whose responsibility it was when problems arose. He said he would like this person to be the GP or someone who could 'rediscover the tradition of personal responsibility'.","Jeremy Hunt added that the country's 'tremendous science tradition' is crucial to securing future of NHS .

A 49-year-old man infected with a respiratory virus believed to be more deadly than Sars has died in Britain, officials have revealed. The Qatari man was being treated for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-nCV) in an intensive care unit at St Thomas’ Hospital in central London. Hospital officials said that the man, who was 49 when he was admitted, died after his condition deteriorated. Deadly: A 49-year-old Qatari man has become the third person to die in Britain after becoming infected with the deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-nCV), pictured . There have now been 77 confirmed cases across nine countries with 41 deaths from the . virus, which emerged last year and is similar to those that cause Sars . and the common cold. Three people have now died in the UK as a result of the infection. Before the latest victim became ill he had travelled to Saudi Arabia where the majority of coronavirus cases have been reported. The patient, who was suffering from acute respiratory syndrome and renal failure, was then admitted to an intensive care unit in Doha, Qatar, on September 7 last year. The man, who has not been named by officials, was transferred to the UK by air ambulance on September 11. Undergoing treatment: The man was admitted to an intensive care unit at St Thomas' Hospital in London, pictured, with acute respiratory syndrome and renal failure in September but died on June 28 . A hospital spokeswoman said: 'Guy’s and . St Thomas’ can confirm that the patient with severe respiratory illness . due to novel coronavirus (MERS-nCV) sadly died on Friday 28 June, after . his condition deteriorated despite every effort and full supportive . treatment.' Despite doctors’ efforts to keep him alive, including connecting him to an artificial lung, he died on Friday last week. This latest death comes after the World Health Organisation (WHO) said in May that Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus - or MERS-CoV - is a 'threat to the entire world'. In a statement in May the World Health Organization (WHO) said: 'The . greatest global concern is about the potential for this new virus to . spread. 'This is partly because the virus has already caused severe disease in . multiple countries, although in small numbers, and has persisted in the . [Middle East] region since 2012. Most cases of the disease have been recorded in Saudi Arabia, which is also expecting millions of Muslin pilgrims to visit this month during Ramadan . 'Of most concern, however, is the fact that the different clusters seen . in multiple countries increasingly support the hypothesis that when . there is close contact this novel coronavirus can transmit from person . to person.' Experts raised concerns that the disease is 'emerging faster than our understanding'. WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan said: 'We understand too little about this virus when viewed against the magnitude of its potential threat.' Cases have been confirmed in Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, France, Germany, Italy, Tunisia and the UK. British health officials have been advised to be vigilant for severe unexplained respiratory illness in anyone who has recently travelled in the Middle East, as well as any unexplained clusters of such illness.

Action: Some in the food industry believe stevia powder, which is 300 time sweeter than sugar but has no calories, could help tackle obesity . It sounds too good to be true - all the sweetness of sugar but with none of the calories. But an extract from a plant found growing wild in South America is being trumpeted as a major weapon in tackling the obesity crisis threatening the health of millions of people around the world. The natural sweetener called stevia is 300 times sweeter than traditional beet or cane sugar and could be a way for people with a sweet tooth to satisfy their sugar cravings totally guilt-free. Dr Margaret Ashwell, a member of the . Scientific Advisory Board of the Global Stevia Institute, an information . service provided by the main suppliers of stevia, believes the health benefits cannot be understated. 'Stevia . can help people enjoy natural-origin sweetness while reducing calories . as part of a healthful, balanced diet,' she told the Independent. She added: 'There are enormous opportunities for industry to meet national . and international pledges to reduce sugar in products to help the . obesity crisis.' Used for thousands of years in South . America cooking, it was added to food as a sweetener as well as a health . tonic and treatment for high blood pressure, heartburn, gout and type 2 . diabetes. Now . multi-national food companies are catching on to the possible benefits . of stevia and are introducing it into to a range of low-calorie . products. According to the National Health . Service's 2013 Statistics on Obesity, Physical Activity and Diet, 65 per . cent of men and 58 per cent of women are overweight or obese in . England, with the numbers continuing to rise. So the plant, used for centuries by Paraguay's Guarani Indians, it has shot from . relative obscurity to being used as a key sweetener by large companies . such as Coca-Cola and Danone in just a few years. Sales of the extract have soared in recent years - up 400 per cent between 2008 and 2012. In 2011 it was approved by the European Food Safety Agency for widespread introduction. Miracle plant: An extract from the leaves of a stevia bush are 300 times sweeter than sugar - but with none of the calories . Some critics have questioned if a calorie free supplement can possibly help in longterm fat loss diets. Dr Robert Lustig, author of Fat . Chance: The Bitter Truth About Sugar, said that weight-loss diets might . not be achieved because the body expects real sugar, the Independent . reported. But this doubt over the effects of . stevia has not stopped some food manufactures introducing the additive . to some of their most popular ranges. In March, this year, fizzy drink . Sprite ditched its 'full-fat' recipe in favour of a lower-calorie . version that uses the 'natural' sweetener. The new formulation of the popular . beverage contains 30 per cent fewer calories - but fans fear it . will have an unusual aftertaste. The . drink is being altered as part of the parent company Coca-Cola's . anti-obesity drive and follows a call by the government to address the . issue. Guilt-free: Stevia, pictured being cultivated for use in the food industry, is being described as an ingredient which could help tackle obesity by cutting the calories in junk food and fizzy drinks . A Coca-Cola spokesman said: 'We are introducing Sprite with Stevia in the UK. Research into stevia’s alleged health benefits have been mixed and many believe the plant could in fact pose health risks. Some research has found that the plant lowered blood pressure. There has also been research into its effects on diabetes. The most obvious benefit of stevia is that it provides sweetness but does not elevate blood glucose levels as white sugar does. But in addition to this, early research has shown that it can actively lower blood sugars. Scientists found that taking 1000 mg daily of stevioside reduced blood sugar levels after meals by up to 18 per cent in people with type 2 diabetes. Other alleged benefits of stevia were analysed in a 2009 review of recent stevia research. Experts at  Mahidol University in Thailand found that a number of studies did show stevia to have blood pressure-lowering, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumour, anti-diarrheal, diuretic, and immunomodulatory actions. This will contain 30 per cent fewer calories and, instead of being added as a mid-calorie addition to the Sprite range, it will completely replace the current Sprite,' it read. 'Stevia, a sweetener from natural origins, is sweeter than sugar but without the calories. 'It is an extract from the leaf of the stevia plant which is native to Paraguay. Stevia has been used for centuries as a source of intense, natural sweetness.' The increasing introduction of the calourie-free natural sweetener comes amid mounting concern about the health effects of the soft drinks enjoyed by millions of Britons every day. Heart attacks, diabetes, weight gain, brittle bones, pancreatic and prostate cancer, muscle weakness and paralysis have all been flagged up as potential problems of drinking soft drinks. Earlier this year, a study warned that just one can of a sugary soft drink a day can raise the risk of diabetes by up to a fifth. A can of Coke contains around eight teaspoons of sugar and 139 calories. This is around 7 per cent of the 2,000 calories a woman is recommended per day. Two cans would use up more than a tenth of a man’s 2,500 daily calorie allowance. Harvard University’s respected School of Public Health warns that sugary drinks ‘are a major contributor to the obesity epidemic’. Research it cites to back this up includes a 20-year study of 120,000 men and women which found those that drank an extra soft drink a day gained, on average, a pound a year more than those that did not up their intake. Over seven years, it would add up to half a stone.","The plant extract called stevia is 300 times sweeter than sugar .

Arrest: Laura Elizabeth Whitehurst, 28, allegedly had sex with three high school students . Laura Whitehurst, the former high school teacher accused of having sex with her students and giving birth to one of their children, pleaded not guilty to the charges against her in court on Tuesday. Whitehurst, who was arrested and charged Monday, was arraigned by video inside the San Bernardino Superior Courthouse. ‘She's a clean-cut American girl sitting in jail, so she's having a hard time, but she will be OK,’ her defense attorney, James Gass, said. The former Citrus Valley High School teacher was wearing a green jail jumpsuit, an indication that she was being held in protective custody. The defendant sat quietly and only spoke to answer the judge's questions. Whitehurst, 28, has been charged with 41 felony counts of unlawful sex acts with a minor, which include 30 counts of unlawful sex with a minor and 11 counts of oral copulation of a person under 18, according to court records. ‘The first 30 counts are basically sex with a minor, or an underage person. And then the other remaining counts are oral copulation with a person under the age of 18. There are three named victims in this case,’ prosecutor Melissa Rodriguez said. Whitehurst, from Redlands, California, was arrested last week after the mother of the boy - now 17 - reported their alleged year-long relationship and subsequent birth of their child to police. The Citrus Valley High student  is believed to have been present at the birth. She met him while acting as his adviser at the school. Since then, two more former students have come forward to claim they had a sexual relationship with Whitehurst. If convicted, she faces up to 29 years in prison. Her bail was increased from $25,000 to $750,000 in light of the recent allegations. She told investigators she and the father of her child began having sex at her apartment after a Disneyland trip in 2012. Another victim was a 14-year-old freshman during the time of their alleged relationship. 'The victim, now 20, told police that he and Whitehurst had sex in her classroom before school, as well as at her apartment and in her car,' a police news release stated. The latest victim to come forward said . he was 16 when he had sex with Whitehurst when she was his English . teacher at Redlands High School. With child: Whitehurst, 28, gave birth to a baby last month who was allegedly fathered by a student, aged 16 . The victim, who identified himself to NBC4 as . 22-year-old Michael Cooper, said the class had been told to write about . their dreams and afterwards, Whitehurst told him she had dreamed of . kissing him during a school field trip. 'I didn't have anything to say . really,' he said. 'I was like, ""Oh really, that's crazy,"" and a couple . of days later, we ended up actually kissing.' He . said that they kissed in her classroom and two weeks later, she invited him to her apartment and . he spent the night. They . continued to have sex a few times a month but he said he never felt as . if they were in a relationship, but when they contacted each other, they . both knew what was going to happen, he said. 'When . it happens, you're kind of like, . all right, this is pretty badass,' he said. 'You know, my teacher is . into me. I was 17 and I was having a good time is what it was. 'I didn't feel like a victim; I'm not . scarred for life or anything. To be honest, I had a . good time when it was going on.' 'Former flame': Michael Cooper, now 22, said he had sex with the teacher when he was just 16. He said that she told him she had dreamed about kissing him and they later had sex at her home . 'Lovers': Images show Cooper, then 16, and Whitehurst, then 23, at the time of their 'relationship' in 2007 . But . in spring 2008, he said he stopped returning the teacher's messages and . calls as he had a girlfriend and had started to feel guilty. They . eventually broke the relationship off amicably, he said. He added that he did not get preferential treatment in class because of their relationship. Cooper . has filed a police report but told authorities he does not wish to . press charges. He told NBC4 that he wanted to share his story to . encourage other victims to come forward. Whitehurst said that they had a . relationship 'but not to that extent', Redlands police Detective Natasha . Crawford said during a phone interview. According to the Redlands Police . Department, Whitehurst's underage lover - with whom she had a child - was 16-years-old during their . year-long relationship, which allegedly started last summer. 'Bad teacher': Whitehurst, left in a yearbook picture, allegedly had sex with three teenage students . The . mother of the alleged victim, who is now 17, became . aware of the affair between her son and his teacher and notified the . Redlands United School District, which in turn contacted police. Whitehurst gave birth to a child June 18, and police say her former student is the father. Since her arrest last week, Whitehurst had been placed on administrative leave. ‘Nothing is as important to us as the safety of our students and the District takes this arrest very seriously. 'We are fully cooperating with police in their investigation of this matter,’ Assistant School Superintendent Sabine Robertson-Phillips said. The educator graduated from Redlands East Valley High School and taught English to sophomores at Citrus Valley, where she was also a Link Crew adviser and a Compact Careers Club adviser. In 2010, Whitehurst was also an assistant soccer coach. She previously was a volunteer soccer coach for American Youth Soccer Organization in Redlands.

The retired farmer developed pneumonia and died three months later. His family have now received an undisclosed payout from the NHS after reaching an out-of-court settlement . Poor treatment: Frank Kelly, 79, died of pneumonia three months after nurses left him outside Worcester Royal Hospital wearing just pyjamas in the rain . Apology: Worcestershire Royal Hospital has apologised for Mr Kelly's poor treatment during his five-month stay at the hospital and his family has received an undisclosed payout from the NHS . They also received an apology after it emerged the incident was just one in a catalogue of errors during Mr Kelly's five-month stay at the hospital. The retired farmer was admitted to Worcestershire Royal Hospital in November 2010 after suffering a second stroke which left him blind. But the family soon took up a 24-hour rota at his bedside after being shocked by the 'appalling' care he received from doctors and nurses. On one visit to the hospital, Frank's son Martin, 51, found his father stood in the middle of the car park wearing nothing but his sodden pyjamas on a rainy day in December 2010. It later emerged he had wandered into the car park after the nurses who were moving him to a new ward lost him. Care: The family of Mr Kelly, . pictured being shaved by his son Matthew while in hospital, say staff were too busy to acre for their father and frequently failed to feed him . Dinner time: Mr Kelly's family visited him every day to feed him after being shocked at the 'appalling' care at Worcestershire Royal Hospital . Martin said: 'When I turned up to see my dad in the car park, I was stunned, I couldn't believe it. 'I stopped the car, raced over and told him I was there. 'It's so sad to think that he worked his whole life and when it came to it, he couldn't even get decent hospital care. 'We all believe that with better care we could have had dad home again.' In February 2011, just a few months after being left in the car park in the middle of winter, Frank died. Frank Kelly was admitted to the hospital in November 2010 after suffering a second stroke . Martin, from St John's in Worcester, . yesterday said the incident was part of a long-running series of . mistreatment that bordered on 'cruelty' and a breach of his human . rights. Martin and the rest of his family received a financial settlement from the hospital after one of Frank's own medical team advised them to take action. Martin added: 'He was not fed properly, they didn't seem to realise that he was blind. We had to take in food every day. 'He was dehydrated all the time and the communication on the wards was just appalling. We were begging for help but he was never given a chance. 'The hospital has admitted a total failure of care and that dad had an awful slice of the cake. 'We didn't do this for any financial reasons, we did it to try and highlight the failings and ensure this sort of thing does not happen to anyone else. 'We have been told it is improving but we are not convinced and we do fear what sort of care we would get if we were ever unfortunate enough to need them again.' He added that the health system had 'too many managers in suits' at the expense of nurses devoted to care. In a letter to Frank's widow Anne, 78, Chief executive Penny Venables said: 'I am acutely conscious that these improvements came too late to positively influence your father's experience and that is a matter of deep regret. 'I can fully understand how angry and frustrated you must have felt about the care he received at the time and how painful it must have been for you to witness his suffering. 'I have taken their concerns extremely seriously and am determined that standards across the trust will continue to be raised. Let down: Members of the Kelly family, from left are brothers Martin, Brian, Matthew and Frank's widow Anne, with their letter of apology from the health authority . 'Everyone is committed to providing the highest quality care for all patients and striving to continuously improve the care we offer.'

Worrying: Hundreds of health service managers have pocketed pay-offs of up to £500,000 - but many have walked straight into new jobs in the NHS. Reforms were ordered in 2010 by the then Health Secretary Andrew Lansley, pictured . Hundreds of health service managers have pocketed pay-offs of up to £500,000 – but many have walked straight into new jobs in the NHS, a report reveals today. Since 2010, the NHS has spent £430 million on redundancy packages for staff of departments scrapped under the  coalition’s health reforms. But more than a fifth of those supposedly no longer needed have already found new jobs within the health service, and thousands more could follow. They have exploited rules which mean they have to wait only four weeks before they can take a new post. The National Audit Office report shows that one unnamed boss was handed a redundancy package worth £578,470 while hundreds of others received payments of more than £200,000. But the Department of Health has refused to name any of these individuals – despite previously promising to be more open and transparent – claiming it would breach confidentiality rules. Last night the ‘jobs merry-go-round’ was attacked by critics of public sector waste. The report has been published just a week after another NAO study revealed how the BBC broke its own rules in negotiating bumper pay-offs for departing staff. NHS reforms were ordered in 2010 by the then Health Secretary Andrew Lansley in a bid to cut the number of managers and give more power to doctors and nurses. They resulted in the abolition of hundreds of regional NHS bureaucracies, such as primary care trusts and strategic health authorities, and the creation of GP-led organisations called clinical commissioning groups. But many senior doctors and other health professionals warned that the shake-up would cost the NHS vast amounts of money which would be diverted away from patient care. Today’s report reveals that the reforms have so far cost the taxpayer £1.1billion, which included £435million on redundancy payments. A total of 10,095 employees have been made redundant since May 2010, each receiving an average pay-out of £43,095. But these figures do not . take into account the redundancies in April when the reforms were . officially implemented and many organisations were abolished. Expensive: Since 2010, the NHS has spent £430million on redundancy packages for staff of departments scrapped under the coalition's health reforms . The Department of Health has admitted the total cost of the reforms may rise to £1.7billion, including £680million in pay-outs. It claims that the reforms will ultimately save the NHS £2.4billion in slashing unnecessary bureaucracy –although the report says it cannot confirm if this is the case. But the report also points out that since the reforms, although 171 bodies were abolished, 240 were set up in their place – meaning there are now 70 more compared to three years ago. The report also points out that 9 per cent of the 45,350 newly created posts have not yet been filled, meaning that more than 4,000 axed managers could walk straight into new jobs. Hospitals and NHS organisations have been ordered to make £20billion of savings by next year so that budgets can be re-invested in better care for the elderly and more advanced treatments. But in the face of such strict targets, many trusts have resorted to sacking nurses and other frontline staff, and rationing drugs and operations. Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Health chiefs have wasted a breathtaking amount of taxpayers’ money on pay-offs when axeing staff. ‘The size of the pay-outs, particularly those handed to senior managers, appear to have been allowed to spiral out of control. Laying off staff at great expense to taxpayers only to hire them back is unacceptable. ‘This is all too typical of the NHS jobs merry-go-round that needlessly costs taxpayers a fortune.’ Andrew Gwynne MP, Labour’s shadow health minister, said: ‘This report lifts the lid on the Government’s shambolic re-organisation of the NHS. Since David Cameron entered Downing Street over 4,000 nursing posts have been axed and one in ten hospitals are now short-staffed. Ministers are taking unacceptable risks with standards of patient care.’ Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the council of the British Medical Association, which represents doctors, said: ‘The findings of the National Audit Office echo many of our concerns about how the NHS reforms were devised and implemented. ‘Introducing radical changes to how the NHS is run and structured during a period of intense financial pressure has been a costly distraction to solving the real challenges facing the health service. ‘All the evidence is pointing to  a worsening financial situation  for the NHS, and the Government needs to urgently rethink  its approach. ‘Most of the savings have come from pay freezes and cuts in the tariffs for services, but this is neither sustainable or likely to deliver the long-term savings that are needed to protect patient services.’ A Department of Health spokeswoman said: ‘The changes made as a result of the reforms mean a huge net gain for the taxpayer. They will save £5.5billion during this Parliament and £1.5billion every year thereafter, to be reinvested back into patient care. ‘We have put doctors and nurses in the driving seat. They are best placed to take decisions about care for their patients – decisions that were previously taken by managers. 'They now have the freedom, power and budget to make sure their local communities get the care and services they really need.’ Thousands of patients’ confidential medical records are being lost by NHS staff every year, figures show. Files containing highly personal information have been mistakenly left in drains, hospital car parks and even branches of WH Smith. Freedom of Information requests show that hospitals made 2,805 confidentiality breaches in the past 12 months – a 20 per cent rise on the previous year. In one example, at Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, Essex, a letter informing a patient they had cancer was left in the car park.","NHS has spent £430m on staff of departments scrapped .

But you never know. It’s been getting close to eight years now we’ve been together. It’s a long time.’ It is the second time 26-year-old Murray has got a little touchy on the subject this week, after being asked the same question at a press conference on Sunday.

"By . Tim Shipman and James Chapman . PUBLISHED: . 18:34 EST, 9 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:50 EST, 10 July 2013 . Criticism: Ed Miliband unveiling his reforms yesterday . Ed Miliband’s reform of Labour’s trade union links was denounced as a ‘complete sham’ last night after it emerged it could leave union barons even richer and more powerful. The Labour leader yesterday unveiled what he billed as ‘big and historic changes’ to the way union members give money to his party. Mr Miliband’s proposal to end the automatic affiliation of union members to the party could cost it part of its income, with some commentators suggesting that as much as £5million of the £9million is at stake. Tony Blair hailed the move as ‘a real act of leadership’. The former prime minister admitted he probably should have taken the same step when he led the party from 1994 to 2007. The explosive reaction expected from the unions did not materialise, as Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said he was ‘very comfortable’ with the proposals – which he said could in fact result in tens of thousands more union members joining Labour. In addition, the man Mr Miliband put in charge of the reforms, former Labour general secretary Ray Collins, actually helped set up Unite. Denouncing the plans, Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘These reforms are a complete sham and no more than a tactical distraction. They do nothing to deal with the scandal around Falkirk or the fact that Unite has fixed the selection of 41 candidates in key marginal seats. ‘No wonder Len McCluskey has been smiling. The only result of these reforms are they will increase the coffers of Unite and his spending power.’ The measures are designed to draw a line under the biggest crisis of Mr Miliband’s leadership, as police probe claims that Unite tried to fix the selection of Labour’s general election candidate in Falkirk by packing the constituency with 100 or more of its own members. In a London speech, Mr Miliband said Falkirk represented ‘part of the death-throes of the old politics’, and he hoped to usher in an ‘open, transparent and trusted’ era. Welcoming: Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said he was ¿very comfortable¿ with the proposals . Rather than being automatically affiliated, union members should be asked to make an active decision to join the party by opting in. They would no longer automatically pay a £3 fee to the party from their union subscriptions and would instead have to opt in. Yet, while Labour risks losing millions of pounds from the political levy, unions will lose nothing since they will be able to keep the money that would have been paid to Labour for themselves. Miliband aides admitted there is nothing to stop union barons using that cash to make one-off payments to Labour’s election war chest instead. If membership rises, union bosses could also end up with more power to pick Labour MPs – even though the reforms are ostensibly designed to loosen their grip on selections. Three million members of unions affiliated to Labour pay the levy, one million are Unite members. Union members who opt-in will become affiliate members of the party and would win new rights to vote in primary elections to pick Labour candidates. Mr Miliband said: ‘In the 21st century it just doesn’t make sense for anyone to be affiliated to a political party unless they have chosen to do so.’ Mr McCluskey yesterday predicted that 100,000 of his members would keep paying the levy, giving the most powerful union baron a block of supporters. He said the move could swell party membership from 200,000 to ‘a far higher number’ and admitted Lord Collins will now have to consider how the changes will affect union power in leadership elections and during votes at Labour conference, where the unions control 50 per cent of the votes. New age: In a London speech, Mr Miliband said Falkirk represented ¿part of the death-throes of the old politics¿, and he hoped to usher in an ¿open, transparent and trusted¿ era . Aides admitted that in leadership elections ‘the electoral college could stay’, meaning unions will retain 30 per cent of the vote which helped Mr Miliband to defeat his brother. Mr Miliband dismissed claims that Lord Collins is a union stooge. But in a blow to the leader, former Labour general secretary Larry Whitty revealed he turned down the job because it was ‘unworkable’. Mr McCluskey was delighted that Mr Miliband refused to change the law to force unions to give up the cash from the levy if members opt out. He said: ‘Those who pay the levy, he wants them to have a second option to see whether they want to opt in to becoming associate members of the Labour Party.’ David Cameron denounced the plans as a ‘smokescreen’. Further allegations last night appeared to suggest rigging was not confined to Falkirk alone. Karen Webb, a former candidate in Peterborough, alleged that Unite fixed the selection in favour of its candidate, Lisa Forbes. Miss Forbes was named on a list of candidates whose selection Unite boasted they had secured. Unite denied the claims. Ed Miliband sought to regain the initiative yesterday amid questions over who really controls his party. Here we analyse the speech he never wanted to give. WHAT HE SAID: ‘What we saw in Falkirk is part of the death-throes of the old politics... it comes against growing mistrust in politics.‘As the Labour Party – the party of working people – we have a special responsibility to stand for a better politics.’ WHAT HE MEANT: Admits his initiative was prompted by the sensational allegations that union members were signed up as party members without their knowledge to influence the selection of a candidate in Falkirk. Until now, he has shown no desire to take on the union barons, to whom he owes his victory against brother David in the party leadership contest. On the front foot: Ed Miliband sought to regain the initiative yesterday . WHAT HE SAID: ‘We do not need to change that law on the right of trade unions to have political funds. But I do want to change the way individual trade unionists are affiliated to the Labour Party through these funds...‘Individual trade union members should choose to join Labour through the affiliation fee, not be automatically affiliated.’ WHAT HE MEANT: Plans for opt-in payment for union members would certainly deprive the party of some cash. But even though less money may go to it directly, subscription funds will be available for union leaders to distribute as they see fit – on anti-Conservative campaigns, or donations in the run-up to an election, for example. It will also mean union members who agree to pay the affiliation fee become party members. Len McCluskey estimates that at least 100,000 of his membership will sign up. WHAT HE SAID: ‘I have asked Ray Collins, former general secretary of the Labour Party, to lead work on how to make this a reality.’ Unimpressed: Prime Minister David Cameron denounced Ed Miliband's plans as a smokescreen . WHAT HE MEANT: Lord Collins is the former assistant general secretary of the Transport and General Workers’ Union and in 2007 helped steer through a merger with Amicus to create the super-union Unite. Tories said the selection of a union man revealed Mr Miliband’s reform plan as a ‘stitch-up’. WHAT HE SAID: ‘We will urgently agree new spending limits for Parliamentary selections to include for the first time all spending by outside organisations.’ WHAT HE MEANT: Argues a spending cap will limit ‘machine politics’ by unions when it comes to picking candidates. But there is no indication of what the limit will be. Crucially, there is no intention to change the leadership rules which means the unions control around a third of Labour’s electoral college . WHAT HE SAID: ‘Can it be right that the rules allow MPs to earn hundreds of thousands of pounds from private legal practice while they are supposed to be an MP, or from outside corporations without any real form of regulation?... At the very least there should be new limits on outside earnings.’ WHAT HE MEANT: A crude but effective attempt to turn some heat on the Tories. Before the last election, David Cameron persuaded the then shadow Cabinet to drop outside interests, but would face uproar if he tried the same with his MPs. WHAT HE SAID: ‘I propose for the next London Mayoral election Labour will have a primary for our candidate selection. Any Londoner should be eligible to vote and all they will need to do is to register as a supporter of the Labour Party at any time up to the ballot. Ray Collins will examine how to pioneer this idea elsewhere too, such as in future Parliamentary selections where a sitting MP is retiring and where the local party has dwindled.’ WHAT HE MEANT: American-style primaries have been pioneered by the Tories, who used them to select some of their candidates in 2010. Critics say the system gives extra power to those with backing from the media or deep pockets.","The Labour leader billed his plans as 'big and historic changes'

The United States is considering speeding up its planned withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan, including a possible 'zero option' that would result in no U.S. forces in that country after 2014, the New York Times reported on Monday. Citing U.S. and European officials, the Times reported that President Barack Obama has become increasingly frustrated by his dealings with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, with their fraying relationship falling to new depths after last month's U.S. move to open peace talks with the Taliban. A June 27 video conference between Obama and Karzai aimed at lowering tensions ended poorly, the Times reported on its website, citing U.S. and Afghan officials with knowledge of the conversation. President Obama, pictured beside Vice President Joe Biden on Sunday, is reportedly considering speeding up American troop withdrawal from Afghanistan . The Times reported that Karzai accused the United States of trying to forge a separate peace with the Taliban and its Pakistani supporters in an arrangement that would expose Karzai's government to its enemies. Obama is committed to wrapping up U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan by the end of 2014, but the United States has been talking with officials in Afghanistan about keeping a small 'residual' force there after next year. Since the video conference, a full military pullout from Afghanistan like the one from Iraq has been transformed from a 'worst-case scenario' to an option 'under serious consideration in Washington and Kabul,' the Times reported. The officials quoted by the Times said no decisions have been made on the pace and scale of the withdrawal. President Barack Obama has reportedly become increasingly frustrated by his dealings with Afghan President Hamid Karzai (pictured) The United States also had planned on keeping a small force in Iraq after the broad troop withdrawal from that country, but talks with Iraqi leaders failed to yield such a deal. A senior Obama administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters: 'All options remain on the table but a decision is far from made.' 'There's always been a zero option, but it was not seen as the main option,' the Times quoted a senior Western official in Kabul as saying. 'It is now becoming one of them, and if you listen to some people in Washington, it is maybe now being seen as a realistic path.' The number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan - now around 63,000 - already is set to decline to 34,000 by next February, the Times noted. The White House has said the great majority of American forces would be out of Afghanistan by the end of 2014.","Obama is considering a speedier withdrawal as his relationship deteriorates with Afghan President Hamid Karzai .

For most fathers-to-be, the mad dash to get to the hospital on time involves weaving through traffic and swearing at the dashboard. The Duke of Cambridge, however, has something a little more efficient up his sleeve – a helicopter. Well, more precisely, it’s in his back garden. With five days to go until his wife is due to give birth to their first child, Prince William has borrowed a helicopter once used to circumnavigate the globe in record time. It means that the 31-year-old duke, who is on duty this week as an RAF Search and Rescue pilot, can cover the 288 miles between his base in North Wales and St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, West London, in just 90 minutes. The distinctive orange McDonnell Douglas four-seater helicopter appears to be on permanent standby in the garden of his rented farmhouse on the island of Anglesey in case it is needed to whisk him off. It was parked there last night. When the time comes, however, it is not believed that William would fly the helicopter himself. Meanwhile Kate, also 31, is dividing her time between their London apartment in the grounds of Kensington Palace and her parents’ home in Berkshire, so she can be closer to the Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital, where she will give birth. The helicopter is owned by the prince’s friend, fellow pilot Simon Oliphant-Hope, who was Pierce Brosnan’s stunt double in the James Bond film Die Another Day. He occasionally offers the couple a lift in the aircraft if he happens to be ‘routing past’ North Wales. The Mail published exclusive photographs of such a trip last month. Last night the couple’s office at Kensington Palace refused to discuss the helicopter parked in the prince’s Welsh garden.

According to specialists Air Charter Service it would normally cost more than £1,000 a day to have a helicopter on standby, while the cost of a flight between Anglesey and London would be around £6,000. A spokesman said: ‘A number of travel options are being considered for the duke should he need to travel back to London from Anglesey at a moment’s notice. ‘This includes by helicopter. However he gets back to London will be at his private expense.’ Mr Oliphant-Hope also declined to comment.","Duchess could be flown to hospital in high-speed chopper .

Troubled footballer Paul Gascoigne was rushed to hospital last night after being found collapsed in the street outside a hotel in London. The star was apparently 'very drunk' and needed crutches to walk before he fell over, prompting worried bystanders to call the police. The incident came just four days after he was arrested for allegedly attacking his ex-wife Sheryl and a train guard in a drunken assault. Gascoigne's celebrity friends, who paid for him to go to rehab in the U.S. earlier this year, are apparently 'disappointed' by his relapse - and suggest that he may never recover from the scourge of alcoholism. In the latest incident, witnesses described seeing the 46-year-old former footballer looking like an 'old disabled guy' and visibly drunk as he wandered aimlessly around central London. He collapsed outside the Royal National Hotel in Russell Square, leading onlookers to call for the police and ambulance. While waiting for an ambulance to arrive, Gascoigne apparently asked to speak to Sheryl, and tried to persuade a bystander to ring her on his mobile. The former England midfielder had two bottles of gin on him as well as hundreds of pounds in cash, according to The Sun. He was taken to a nearby hospital, believed to be University College Hospital, for treatment. Australian tourist Daniel Stubbe told the Daily Mirror: 'He had a stick or a crutch and we thought he was just this old disabled guy. He looked so old and so ill.' An employee of the hotel told The Sun: 'There was an ambulance and motorbike called to Gazza who was lying flat on his face.' Gazza collapsed outside the Royal National Hotel in Bedford Way, central London . Many witnesses took to Twitter to . express their sadness at the sight of the fallen star and ask his . celebrity friends to step in and save Gascoigne from his alcohol . troubles. Victor Abbey . sent a message to Piers Morgan saying, 'Just seen one of the saddest . sights, a drunk Gazza, if you can reach out to him or his friends please . do, he still needs help.' Matt . Morrison tweeted: 'Just bumped into Gazza. By which I mean he almost . fell into me. On crutches, barely recognisable, gaunt, wasted. Saddest . thing ever.' Another . Twitter user wrote to Gascoigne's former teammate Gary Lineker saying . that the ex-player was 'very drunk' and 'very sick', adding that he . looked 'lost and confused'. Relapse: Gascoigne was said to be on the road to recovery from his alcohol problems before being arrested and hospitalised in the past week . A spokesman for the . Metropolitan Police said: 'Police were called to reports of a man . causing a disturbance outside a hotel in Russell Square. 'The man was taken to a central London hospital by the ambulance service. There were no arrests.' Former international cricketer Ronnie . Irani, who contributed to a £100,000 fund which enabled Gascoigne to . undergo a rehab programme in Arizona, said today that the news did not . come as a shock. 'Are we surprised? No, it's sad but . we just hope and pray that he can get through it,' he told BBC Radio 5 . Live, adding that he and other friends of the star are 'disappointed'. Couple: Gascoigne demanded to speak to his ex-wife Sheryl, with whom he is picture in 1993 . He suggested that Gascoigne might never get over his drink problems, pointing out that only 10 per cent of alcoholics ever recover and adding: 'He's got mental health issues as well that we know about, so it's going to be very tough for him.' Asked if he was worried that the footballer's disease might eventually kill him, Irani admitted: 'When it comes to addictions, I think alcohol takes the most lives, so there's every chance that this could happen.' The former Essex and England star also seemed to suggest that Gascoigne had never thanked him for contributing to the rehab as he said, 'I don't need a thanks from Paul Gascoigne.' Last Thursday, Gascoigne was arrested at Stevenage train station following reports he had grabbed a guard by the throat and then held Sheryl by the arm when she tried to step in. Peak: The talented England midfielder is pictured during the semi-final of the 1990 World Cup . He was held by police overnight and . released on bail in the morning, but later that day was apparently seen . swigging gin from the bottle in a convenience store in London. Five months ago, Gascoigne went to rehab in the U.S. after being seen drunk and rambling at a public Q&A event. The £100,000 cost of his treatment was funded by celebrity friends such as Lineker and DJ Chris Evans, and in May Gascoigne was seen with his family at Windsor racecourse looking happy and healthy. He told ITV's Daybreak that he wanted to 'get back to reality' and pledged to stay sober, although he admitted that his alcohol troubles were likely to continue.","Former footballer was walking on crutches and 'looked like an old man'

From Sloanes to WAGs, no one has gorgeous, flowing manes of hair like very rich women do. And they don't get much richer than Tamara Ecclestone, the perma-tanned, yacht-flitting daughter of Formula 1 boss Bernie, who recently married in a £7 million extravaganza in the south of France and is said to be worth £300 million. Socialite Tamara's bouncy blow-dry puts even the Duchess of Cambridge to shame. It speaks of luxury, pampering and - whisper it - the free time to spend in expensive salons which comes of not having to work. Which is why her latest venture, Show Beauty, a premium haircare range comprising 11 'volumising, thickening, conditioning and finishing products for the world's most discerning customers', has attracted so much attention. The 'indulgent and luxurious' line is stocked only in the most exclusive department stores - Selfridges, Harvey Nichols and Harrods. Every product is scented with a fragrance developed by Givaudan, the eminent perfume house behind iconic scents including L'Air Du Temps, Opium, Obsession and Poison. Its adverts can be seen in upmarket glossy magazines this month, and promise us mortals the chance to look like multi-millionaires. The price tags are pretty striking too. The cheapest products are the dry shampoo, a texture spray and a hairspray, each of which costs £30; the most expensive is a £55 hair fragrance. In fact, were you to purchase every product - as some women are said to have been doing in Harrods - then it would set you back £375. For that sort of money, you would hope for a wig made of Tamara's own hair - or a shampoo and a conditioner at the very least (both of which are conspicuously absent from the line-up). The products undoubtedly look expensive, coming in metallic bottles with quilted relief designs and chunky plastic lids that - from a distance, if you squint - look like cut-glass stoppers. As for the fragrance - to me, it smells like burnt sugar. But apparently I'm missing the point. According to the website, Tamara's Show Beauty is 'more than a luxury haircare brand, it is a lifestyle statement and a window into the often untouchable world of elite elegance'. I'm not sure any window is worth this sort of cash. After all, you can buy a can of Batiste dry shampoo for £2.99 and good old L'Oreal Elnett hairspray for £4. Show off: Tamara's range of very expensive luxury haircare products . So to find out if Tamara's stuff is any better, we asked top stylist Stephen Low of London's exclusive Neville Hair & Beauty salon to blind test £245 worth of Show Beauty products against High Street best-sellers at a total of £38.01. Stephen looks after the locks of seriously groomed posh girls such as Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Poppy Delevingne, so he's perfectly placed to judge. To make the test as fair as possible, we decanted all the products into clear plastic bottles or used masking tape to disguise the branding. Here's what Stephen had to say: . HAIRSPRAY . Tamara's Show Beauty Finishing Spray, £30, harrods.com . This smells terrible and it's too sticky on the hair. It does give a firm hold, but also leaves a residue on the hair if you apply too much. Not for anyone who wants a natural look with movement. L'Oreal Elnett, £4, boots.com . I liked the fresh smell of this and it gave a good hold with no residue left behind. It brushed through the hair nicely - a good product that I would happily work with. WINNER: High Street . DRY SHAMPOO . Tamara's Show Beauty dry shampoo, £30, harrods.com . The cloying scent was really unpleasant, although it left no residue and still created a fresh and revived look to a style. Batiste dry shampoo,  £2.99, boots.com . I really liked the smell, but when it came to performance I was disappointed. It left a white powdery residue that might be OK on blonde hair but would really show up on a brunette. WINNER: Tamara (as long as you can put up with the smell) Turn up the volume: Tamara's volumising product was hard to work with . MOUSSE . Tamara's Show Beauty Lux Volume Mousse, £30, harrods.com . This had a good foam and was not too sticky. The hair looked great. I'd be happy to use this product again. Garnier Fructis Style Big Volume Mousse, £2.65, boots.com . This was a little heavy and actually gave a bit too much grip to hair making it quite difficult to blow-dry. This meant the hair was left feeling rather tacky. WINNER: Tamara . TREATMENT OIL . Tamara's Show Beauty Pure Treatment Oil, £50, harrods.com . This leaves a lot of residue. Be careful how much you use - it can weigh the hair down and make it look greasy. Lee Stafford Argan Oil,  £11.99, boots.com . I wasn't impressed with this either. When you're putting oil on the hair, a light texture is essential and neither of these scored well on that front. WINNER: Neither. I prefer Shu Uemura Nourishing Protective Oil (£39.50, feelunique.com). VOLUME LOTION . Tamara's Show Beauty Lux Volume Lotion, £40, harrods.com . This was very hard to work with - dense, sticky, tough to blow-dry and the smell wasn't very appealing either. Tresemme 24 Hour Body Dramatic Volume Blow Dry Lotion, £5.50, boots.com . This was also a bit too sticky on the hair - although I did like the fresh smell. WINNER: High Street. Not my favourite volumising product, but better than the other one. THICKENING SPRAY . Tamara's Show Beauty Divine Thickening Mist, £35, harrods.com . Although this did thicken the hair, it made it hard to blow-dry and dragged it down. Samy Fat Hair Thickening Spray, £5.99, superdrug.com . This wasn't too sticky, blow-dried well and gave a good hold. I liked the smell, too. I would be happy to use this on my clients. WINNER: High Street. Knot great: Tamara's Texture Spray was heavy and tended to make hair clumpy . TEXTURE SPRAY . Tamara's Show Beauty  Premiere Working Texture  Spray, £30, harrods.com . This was heavy and I had to be very careful how much I used to avoid clumping or matting. Aussie Dual Personality Texturising & Conditioning Gel Spray, 150ml, £4.89, boots.com . Lightweight, with a great fresh scent. WINNER: High Street . STEPHEN'S VERDICT . I've always felt you don't have to spend a fortune on haircare; it's about finding products that you like, not packaging or price. The basis of gorgeous, glossy hair is a great shampoo and conditioner. If hair's not properly prepared, you won't get the best results from other products. I won't be swapping any of my usual kit for Tamara's products - not least because I find the smell really unappealing. If you're desperate to buy them, the dry shampoo and mousse are your best bets. I wouldn't use the rest.","The socialite has just released a new line of luxury haircare products .

Two engineers were killed when they were dragged onto a conveyor belt while carrying out repairs, an inquest heard today. James Bibby, 25, and Thomas Elmer, 27, died while working on a 150ft tall silo at the Sonae factory in Kirkby, Merseyside, on December 7, 2010. Coroner’s officer Lynda Roberts told the jury at Bootle Town Hall: 'It is believed the maintenance work was almost complete when the conveyor belt has started up and both males were dragged into the machinery.' Thomas Elmer (left) James Bibby (right) were killed when they were dragged onto a conveyor belt while carrying out repairs at a factory, an inquest has heard . John Moutrie, a specialist mechanical inspector for the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), said that the 'tragic incident' occurred while the work was carried out 'without the conveyor belt being isolated'. He said: 'The conveyor would not have run if the isolator was off and the incident could not have occurred.' Mr Moutrie questioned the Sonae safety procedures and the 'Permit to Work' which he said outlined how a 'permit issuer' - or staff member responsible for safety - should have checked that machine. He said the staff member in question was 'apparently not trained' and 'may not have been competent to authorise the permit to work procedure'. A specialist inspector for the HSE questioned safety procedures at the Sonae factory (pictured) But Mr Moutrie also said that Mr Bibby and Mr Elmer should have checked their own machine and applied isolation 'locks' prior to starting work. He added: 'In my opinion if it’s an outside contractor working on the site it’s doubly important that it’s inspected by the issuer.' The inquest heard the conveyor belt had been triggered automatically as factory machinery started to dump wood chips into the silo. The two men, both from Rossendale, Lancashire, were working on one of four silos - described as the overflow silo - which was used when the three other silos were full up. The jury was told that prior to the incident both men were 'fit and healthy' and that toxicology tests later confirmed that no alcohol or drugs were found in their systems. A post mortem examination found that both men died from multiple injuries. The inquest, heard in front of Merseyside Coroner Christopher Sumner, is expected to continue for around three weeks. The factory was burnt to the ground in 2011 and Portuguese company Sonae Industria stopped production in September 2012.

In fact Linsey, 33, is so strong she can tear a telephone book with her bare hands, bend a frying pan in half and crush apples with her biceps. Despite her butter-wouldn't-melt look, the pretty brunette bends metal bars into hearts, uses her fist to hammer nails into wood and can even blow a hot water bottle up like a balloon - until it bursts. Scroll down for video . Core strength: Strong woman Linsey Lindberg crushes a pair of apples with her biceps . Linsey, known by her stage name Mama Lou travels the world showcasing her unique talent in a series of bizarre feats of strength. The former religious studies graduate, from Austin, Texas was working at a prestigious accounting firm in New York before she quit to follow her dream to join the circus. She spent time performing as an aerialist at a circus in Montreal before deciding to use her strength to create a unique act of her own. Linsey spent months attempting to rip telephone directories in half and bending bars in a bid to carve out her niche in the industry.

She said: 'I was working at AXA Financial with grand offices in the Rockefeller Centre making more money than both my parents and I decided to quit my job and run away with the circus. 'Everyone thought I was crazy, I had this great job and yet I was quitting to work as a circus performer. But I just thought if I don't do it now, I never will. 'After a while I fell out of love with the circus and wanted to become a street performer but I knew I needed an act, something brand new. 'I'd always been quite strong and so decided to base my act on my strength. One day I looked at a telephone book and thought 'I wonder if I can rip it in half?' The idea for my act came from there. 'It wasn't easy , there was a lot of trial and error. I would get my room mate in Montreal to help me out with my acts. Tough nut: The strongwoman hammers a nail into a piece of wood with her bare hands . 'I'd beg him to help me with these . really weird stunts. I'd built this bed of nails at home and I'd be like .

Crunchtime: Strongwoman Linsey goes to work on a metal bar which she swiftly bends into a heart shape .

'Blowing up and popping a hot water bottle is definitely the hardest and most dangerous part of my act. 'It took about a year to perfect, I can now do it under a minute. 'There's so much air pressure that when it explodes the bits of rubber often hits me in the face, which hurts.

Michael Jackson was a 'basket case' who would 'fall on his ass' if he attempted one of his trademark dance moves, according to an email written by the production manager of the star's planned comeback tour, a court heard. In the message to AEG live director Randy Phillips, sent just five days before Jackson died, production manager John 'Bugzee' Hougdahl raised concerns about the singer's poor physical and mental health. He wrote: 'I have watched him deteriorate in front of my eyes over the last 8 weeks. He was able to do multiple 360 spins back in April. He'd fall on his ass if he tried now.' 'A basket case': Michael Jackson rehearses for the 'This Is It' tour. The show's producer expressed grave concerns over the singer's deteriorating health, a court heard . Houghdal told Phillips how AEG live director Kenny Ortega had sent Jackson home early from rehearsal. He wrote: 'He was a basket case and Kenny was concerned he would embarrass himself on stage, or worse yet -- get hurt. The company is rehearsing right now, but the DOUBT is pervasive.' Ortega also wrote to AEG Live CEO Randy Phillips raising his concerns about the star's ability to perform. He said: 'I honestly don't think he is ready for this based on his continued physical weakening and deepening emotional state.' He said Jackson was having trouble 'grasping the work' at rehearsals. Ortega, . who knew Jackson well and worked with him closely preparing his 'This . Is It' shows, described seeing 'strong signs of paranoia, anxiety and . obsessive-like behavior' with Jackson. Jackson would 'fall on his ass' if he tried to do a 360 degrees spin production manager John 'Bugzee' Hougdah, claimed in an emaill . 'I think the very best thing we can do is get a top psychiatrist to evaluate him ASAP.' In his reply to Ortega, Phillips said: 'Please stay steady. Enough alarms have sounded. It is time to put out the fire, not burn the building down.' At an earlier hearing Phillips has explained that  by 'burn the building down,' he meant pulling the plug on the tour. Michael Jackson died after Dr. Conrad Murray administered an overdose of anaesthetic propofol on June 25, 2009. Murray, who agreed to work on the 'This Is It' shows for $150,000 a month, provided Jackson with propofol as a sleep aid. Lawyers for the Jackson family claim AEG bosses could have prevented his death if they had heeded warning signs about his health and mental condition. The suit contends AEG had hired, retained or supervised Dr Murray, however AEG denies this and claims it bears no responsibility for Jackson's death. On the day the emails were exchanged Phillips met with Dr Murray, Jackson and Ortega at Jackson's home. The Jackson family's lawyers claim AEG used the meeting to put pressure on Dr Murray to ensure Jackson was fit to rehearse. AEG lawyers argue that Dr Murray had assured the producer's there was nothing to worry about. The court heard yesterday from a doctor who treated Michael Jackson during a 1993 concert tour that had to be canceled when the singer entered rehab testified Monday about the signs that led him to conclude the singer had a problem with prescription pain medications at the time. In videotaped testimony, Dr. Stuart . Finkelstein said he was later asked by concert promoter AEG Live to act . as Jackson's personal physician during the ill-fated 'This Is It' tour . in 2009 but wanted to know if Jackson was 'clean.' AEG executive Paul Gongaware said he didn't believe Jackson had any prescription drug issues, Finkelstein testified. Finkelstein's testimony was recorded . during a February deposition that was played for jurors hearing a . negligence lawsuit by Jackson's mother against AEG Live LLC. Katherine . Jackson claims AEG failed to properly investigate another doctor who . later gave her son an overdose of propofol and that the . company ignored warning signs about her son's health. Email exchange: 'This Is It' tour director Kenny Ortega (left) warned the company's CEO Randy Phillips over Michael Jackson's poor health five days before he died, a court heard . Finkelstein . said he first suspected Jackson had a dependence on pain medications in . 1993 while working on the 'Dangerous' tour. He recounted spending 24 . hours in the singer's hotel suite and administering morphine . intravenously to deal with Jackson's pain. He . said he gave Jackson morphine during their first meeting because the . singer's buttocks were scarred from previous unspecified treatments and . he was concerned about giving an injection of the painkiller Demerol. He . said he also noticed that Jackson appeared to have a high tolerance for . morphine and had on a patch that administered another opiate drug. Finkelstein . said he gave Jackson one other painkiller treatment before the . 'Dangerous' tour was halted after what he described as an intervention . by Elizabeth Taylor and others in Mexico City. Jurors . also heard Monday from Kenny Ortega, a choreographer and director who . worked with Jackson on preparations for the 'Dangerous' tour and later . shows, including 'This Is It.'

Michael Jackson's Mother Katherine Jackson (Pictured ) is suing AEG Live claiming claim AEG bosses could have prevented the star's death if they had heeded warning signs about his physical and mental condition . Finkelstein, who now specializes in addiction medicine and works for concert promoters treating injuries to performers, said he relayed his concerns about Jackson's painkiller use to Gongaware, then a 'Dangerous' tour worker.

Victim: Lay preacher Alan Greaves was killed as he made his way to play the organ at midnight mass on Christmas Eve . A man accused of murdering a church organist on Christmas Eve has told a jury how he was frightened of his co-accused who has already admitted the killing. Ashley Foster, 22, told the jury at Sheffield Crown Court today that he was afraid he was going to be beaten up by Jonathan Bowling, also 22, when he brandished a pick-axe handle as the pair went for a walk on December 24 last year. He told jurors how he tried to calm Bowling down after he threatened to kill another man during a row earlier the same evening. Foster is accused of battering 68-year-old Alan Greaves to death as the organist walked from his home to play at midnight mass at St Saviour's Church in the High Green area of Sheffield. Bowling has already admitted murdering the grandfather, but prosecutors allege Foster also took part in the attack. Foster gave evidence today supported by an intermediary. At times he was barely audible in the courtroom and he was frequently asked to repeat his answers to questions from his barrister, Adrian Waterman QC, so the judge and jury could hear them. Foster told the jury how he had known Bowling since he was about 13 years old, when his mother was involved in a relationship with Bowling’s father, Leslie. He told the jury how Leslie Bowling often beat him up and tried to kill his mother. He said the violence was such that his mother was given a new name and the family moved to Cornwall for a time. Father-of-two Foster told the jury how Bowling had also beaten him up - once because his dad had given him £50 to do it. He said his family returned from Cornwall and Bowling would come around to his house, despite him not wanting him to. Battered: Mr Greaves sustained 'grave and catastrophic head injuries in the attack, and he died in hospital three days later . 'I was scared of telling him to go away,' Foster said. 'Scared of him trying to beat everyone up in my house and beat me up.' Accused: Foster was at times inaudible as he spoke during the third week of his trial at Sheffield Crown Court, pictured . Foster told the jury how he and Bowling went walking around High Green on Christmas Eve last year. He said he was trying to calm the other man down after an argument in which he had threatened to kill someone they had been with earlier. Foster said that at one point during their walk Bowling went off for a moment and came back with a pick-axe. He said he knocked the head off it, leaving just the handle. He said: 'I thought he was going to beat me up with it. 'I thought he was going to beat me up there.' Foster described how he had drunk one Budweiser at a family gathering before the two men went, out but admitted he had smoked cannabis. The jury has heard that Mr Greaves sustained 'grave and catastrophic head injuries in the attack, and he died in hospital three days later. Prosecutors say he was hit with a pick-axe handle and another weapon, possibly a hammer. Foster denies one count of murder.

Tragic: Gary Windle who collapsed and died in large snow drifts just half a mile from his home in March this year . A man died from hypothermia after collapsing in large snow drifts just half a mile from his home following a night out with friends, an inquest has heard. Dressed in only a shirt, light jacket, trousers and shoes, Gary Windle was found by a farmer in Shay Lane, Briercliffe, buried under deep snow. The tragedy happened on the weekend Britain experienced some of the heaviest snowfall in decades. The 25-year-old had taken a taxi from a friend's house and was dropped near his house in Briercliffe, Lancashire, on March 23. But surrounding roads leading to his home were blocked because of the heavy snowfall. The body of Mr Windle was found later that day in a nearby field. He was taken by air ambulance to the Royal Blackburn Hospital where he was pronounced dead. Giving evidence, pathologist Dr Abdul Al-Dawoud told Burnley Coroner's Court that alcohol could make a person more susceptible to hypothermia because it reduces the core temperature of the body which then leads to disorientation and poor decision making. Recording a verdict of misadventure, Mark Williams, East Lancashire deputy coroner, said: 'It is clear he intended to walk home but unfortunately never made it.' Speaking at the time Chief Inspector Derry Crorken described his death as a 'tragic accident' and said conditions around where Mr Windle's body were found were 'absolutely trecherous'.

Two doctors locked their nanny in her room, told her she would never be allowed to go home and said they would ‘sell’ her because she was costing too much money, a court heard. Drs Safaa Hassan Ismail, 45, and Hussien El-Maghraby, 47, are accused of trafficking, false imprisonment and holding Egyptian Asmaa Hemdan in servitude, Southwark Crown Court heard today. The couple arranged travel documents through a relative bringing the 27-year-old to their home in Muswell Hill in May 2011 with the intention of exploiting her, it is claimed. Accused: Safaa Hassan Ismail (left) and Hussien El-Maghraby (right) are accused of trafficking, false imprisonment and holding Egyptian Asmaa Hemdan in servitude . The alleged victim was told she would be working as a nanny for the couple’s young son, and occasionally looking after their niece, who also lived with the couple, being paid £200 a month to work six days a week. But when she arrived her passport was taken from her and she was forced to work long hours doing other chores including cleaning the house. The court heard how the woman was locked in the house when the couple went out, kept under ‘constant watch’ and only allowed out of the house when accompanying Dr Ismail. After becoming ‘very depressed’ she asked to go back to Egypt, but was locked in her room without food and water and told she couldn’t come out until ‘she learnt some manners’, the court heard. Following a discussion with Dr Ismail after the incident, she was told she would ‘never be allowed to leave’. The court heard the woman overheard a conversation between the couple in which she claims they said she would be sold as she was costing to much. Hearing: Southwark Crown Court (pictured) heard how the couple allegedly arranged travel documents to bring the 27-year-old to their home in Muswell Hill in May 2011 with the intention of exploiting her . The family were preparing to move from London to Rugby for Dr Maghraby’s job. After four months of her alleged ordeal she took a rare opportunity to flee, the court heard. She was found sobbing at a bus stop by a stranger and later reported her ordeal to the police. Opening the case, prosecutor Timothy Forster said today: 'Asmaa Hemdan was told that she would be working as a nanny for the couple's young son for these two defendants Dr Safaa Ismail and Dr Hussien El-Maghraby, both of whom are medical doctors. 'She said she was physically abused, . pushed and shoved by Dr Ismail. There are photos that you will see that . show bruising on the alleged victim. Even though she is a very religious . woman she was prevented from going to the Mosque' - Prosecutor Timothy Forster . 'Asmaa Hemdan comes from Eygpt and is from a very poor background. She had previously worked as a cleaner for Dr Ismail’s sister. This is the connection to the two defendants. 'This case is essentially about expectations.' He said she expected to be paid a fixed sum of £200 to be a nanny and would be treated as a member of the family. He said: 'She thought she would be given the opportunity to improve herself by taking an educational course and by meeting people. 'She had been interviewed in Egypt by Dr Ismail’s sister in law and this is when she says she was told what her duties would be. 'But when she arrived with the family the reality of her life was decidedly different from what she had been lead to expect.' Mr Forster said the victim's passport was taken away from her and never returned and she was forced to work long hours. He said: 'Indeed, she was a nanny, she was a cleaner, on top of that she was expected to look after Dr Ismail’s every need, and kept under watch by Dr Ismail constantly. Allegation: The court heard how the woman was locked in the house when the couple went out and only allowed out when accompanying Dr Ismail. Pictured is Dr Hussein El Maghraby at Southwark Crown Court . 'She was told she would be paid £200 a month into a bank account and indeed an account was opened for her when she first arrived. Four hundred pounds was paid into the bank account in the four month period she was living with the family. 'But she was never given access to this money. She never had a bank card. If she wanted to get money she would have to go with Dr Ismail.' He said she was not allowed to leave the house on her own and when Ismail left the house should be locked inside. He said: 'She said she was physically abused, pushed and shoved by Dr Ismail. There are photos that you will see that show bruising on the alleged victim. Even though she is a very religious woman she was prevented from going to the Mosque. 'The hard work and long hours she was forced to do resulted in back pain but when she asked to go the doctor she was not allowed to go.' Mr Forster said Ms Hemdan asked to go home to Egypt after she became depressed with the work, but Ismail became angry following the request and locked her in her room. Mr Forster said: 'She was not given any water or food and told she couldn’t come out until she had apologised to the family and learned some manners.' Mr Forster went on to say: 'She recalls overhearing a conversation between Dr Ismail and Dr Maghraby, in which Dr Maghraby is said to have complained that the victim was costing the family too much money. To which she says she heard Dr Ismail say ""don’t worry when we move house we can sell her"". 'If you believe this account this is a clear indication of how the pair viewed the victim.' Ms Hemdan accepted the job in the UK hoping to be able to provide for her brothers and sisters in Cairo, the court heard. The alleged victim, who is giving evidence from behind a screen, said she had been promised a regular wage and support for her struggling family. 'My siblings were the main reason for me to accept to travel to England’, she told the court. ‘They had no income, and I had high hopes that I could work and help them financially.’ Ms Hemdan said her previous employer, Ismail’s sister Hanaa, had promised her a better life in the UK. ‘Dr Hanaa told me that while I was away, if I took the job they would take care of my brothers and sisters’, she said. ‘We didn’t have enough money to pay the rent, or for food, and she reassured me they would be taken care of while I was away.’ She added: ‘Dr Hanaa told me that any time I wanted to come back home, they would bring me.’ The alleged victim said her previous employer treated her well, but she was told to expect even better conditions in the UK with Ismail and El Maghraby. ‘Dr Hanaa used to mention she had a sister who lived in London, who had a son’, she said. ‘She used to tell me she liked my work, I was honest and straight forward, and she would recommend me to work for her sister.’ Ms Hemdan was taken to the British embassy to get a visa, and signed papers for a new passport before leaving Cairo. Speaking through an interpreter, she said she did not understand the paperwork, which was in English, but signed it because she trusted her employer at the time. She was handed her passport on the plane to the UK, the court heard, but it was taken from her as soon as she got through customs. ‘There was a page in Arabic which said that every person was responsible for their passport’, she said. ‘When I found out it was my responsibility to hold on to that document, I would have preferred to hold on to it. But when I crossed passport control, she took it from me.’ Ms Hemdan said she never saw the passport again. Her evidence continues. The trail is expected to last eight days. Both defendants deny the charges. The case continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Doctors accused of trafficking and false imprisonment .

A golf club boss and qualified first-aider ignored a barmaid who collapsed in a potentially lethal diabetic coma to carry on drinking - because he was off-duty. An employment tribunal heard how 'contemptuous' Allen Gray failed to help or even dial an ambulance for Michele Polidano, 53, when she fell unconscious at Gorleston Golf Club in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. Mrs Polidano, who had to be assisted by customers, resigned in disgust and has now won a legal battle with her former employers after launching a claim for constructive dismissal - but the club is still refusing to apologise. 'Appalling': When Michele Polidano fell unconscious at Gorleston Golf Club in Great Yarmouth, her manager Allen Gray failed to help her or even summon an ambulance, a tribunal heard . The tribunal ruled in Mrs Polidano's favour after hearing she had been put at risk by rules banning eating behind the bar, making it more difficult for her to manage her diabetes. Referring to Mr Gray, panel judge Robin Postle said: 'It was, putting it mildly, appalling behaviour, contemptuous and unacceptable for a responsible line manager . 'One has to bear in mind that if a hypoglycaemic attack goes untreated it could lead to cardiac arrest,' he added. The tribunal heard that Mr Gray, a man of ‘some 25 stone’, had 'taken against' Mrs Polidano and had been known to fly into an aggressive rage in response to some of her 'reasonable' requests. Golf Club manager David James had told the tribunal that Mrs Polidano was allowed to eat in the TV room and leave the bar unattended. But the panel dismissed his evidence and described him as 'an evasive witness who found the truth an elusive concept'. Mrs Polidano had to be assisted by customers and later resigned in disgust before winning a legal battle against her former employers . Following the settlement Mrs Polidano said: 'I’m just so pleased that it’s all over with. 'The last 11 months have been really, really stressful. I feel like my life has been on hold.' She said the outcome of the incident might have been much worse were it not for the golfers at the club who came to her aid. 'I . get upset even thinking about it now, but if it wasn’t for them there’s . a possibility I might not be here today. I was very fortunate,' she . said. Tribunal panel judge Robin Postle . 'I was so shocked at the time that I resigned the next day. Personally I can’t imagine treating another human being that way. I’m still shocked at what he didn’t do.' She thanked the ordinary golf club members, who she described as 'kind and decent people'. 'Most of them had no idea of what I was going through - I think a lot of them were surprised,' said Mrs Polidano. 'But every time I wanted to give up, they helped me to keep going.' Mrs Polidano’s additional claims of indirect discrimination and discrimination arising from disability were dismissed.

The sixth member of a gang who tortured a British man in a Reservoir Dogs-style attack on the Algarve, has been jailed for nine years. Matthew Conde fled to Britain after discovering other gang members had been arrested by Portuguese police over the kidnap and maiming of James Ross. He was subsequently detained on an international arrest warrant - but was still in custody in the UK when gang leader Steven Johnson was jailed for 25 years by an Algarve court after a trial in July last year. Four other men received prison sentences at the time ranging from 15 to two-and-a-half years. The same court in Loule near Faro jailed Conde, 26, yesterday to nine and a half years after convicting him of attempted murder and aggravated kidnapping. Ross, 28, from Wick, Caithness, was held captive for 13 days in 2010 and tortured in a dispute over a £100,000 drugs debt. Conde's sentencing judges announced in a written ruling: 'Despite it not being proven that Matthew Conde had inflicted the torture, he kept prisoner for several days a person who had body parts missing, had been burnt with a cigarette lighter and was suffering terrible pain.' Defence lawyers for the Brit said afterwards they would appeal because Conde freed Ross after discovering his accomplices had been arrested by police. Ross survived the horrific ordeal despite having an ear, two fingers and three toes cut off with bolt cutters. He was also stripped naked, nailed to a piece of wood, burned with a cigarette lighter and beaten with a baseball bat. Accused: Callum McLeod (left) and William Quinn (right) were part of the gang . Johnson's gang also crushed Ross's testicles in a clamp until he almost past out in agony. Johnson was jailed for 25 years for attempted murder, kidnap, GBH and drug trafficking. Fellow gang member Callum McLeod, 46, from Stornoway, Isle of Lewis, was sentenced to 15 years. Terence McGurck, 34, and William Quinn, 55, both from Coventry, were . jailed for eight years, and Ronald Lee Rose, 26, also from Coventry, for . two-and-a-half years. Ross was lured to the Algarve with the promise of a job but was . kidnapped shortly after landing at Faro airport and was taken to a . secluded villa near Boliqueime. Johnson, from Radcliffe, Manchester, believed Ross owed him money and . that he had betrayed him by working for a rival gang of drug . traffickers. Johnson even cut off Ross's wedding ring finger and told his victim: 'This is for Donna,' Ross's wife and mother of kids James, seven and . Danielle, 12. Accused: Terence McGurck (left), Ronald Rose (centre) and Steven Johnson (right) before the trial . Prosecutors said the gang planned to murder Ross by tying a 30 kilo weight to him and dumping in a reservoir. But their plans were frustrated when the car with Ross inside crashed into a tree. He managed to escape after police arrested some of the suspects. Ross had plastic surgery and has since returned to Scotland. Reliving his horror attack after . coming home, he said: 'They sliced off the tendon in my leg. They were . trying to chop my foot off.'

A supermarket's summer advertising campaign featuring a famous Christmas song has managed to infuriate both shoppers and employees. The chain has been inundated with complaints about the jingly references to mistletoe and carol singing in Andy Williams’ hit It’s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year, which has been repeatedly played in stores while the sun beats down outside. The song is being used ironically in conjunction with a TV campaign, which staff have also reportedly asked to be stopped, to advertise the Co-op’s range of summer products. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Christmas time? Shoppers and staff have complained about Co-op's summer advertising campaign which features a festive theme . Here comes the summer: The advert makes a number of visual allusions to Christmas . Sand angel: The advert features Andy Williams' It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year, but shoppers have been infuriated after also hearing it in stores . After the criticism and promises by shoppers on Facebook to do whatever the Co-op wanted as long as it stopped playing the song, the supermarket chain agreed to play the song half as often. In the TV advert, a summer barbecue makes visual allusions to Christmas: blossom falls like snow, a couple kiss under salad leaves and the mother brings a wonderful roast chicken. This is, however, all lost on shoppers filling their trolleys. They know only that they are listening to a Christmas hit in the middle of July. And a frustrated customer wrote on the company’s Facebook page: ‘I promise you I will shop at Co-op every day, I’ll get a members card, I’ll force all my friends to get one. Just please, please, please stop playing the godforsaken Christmas song.’ One member of staff wrote on the same page: ‘Having to listen to it all day. Terrible.’ Another wrote: ‘It’s ridiculous. In some breaks they were playing it three times in a row.’ Under the salad leaves? Employees have written on the company's Facebook page asking for the TV advert to stop . Barbecue: The advert is set at a barbecue at the height of summer . Bearing gifts: Others have praised the advert and even described it as 'really quite clever' A spokesman for the Co-op said: ‘We have already decreased the number of times the ad is played on the radio by half. We will continue to review this.’ Meanwhile, employees have also written on the company's Facebook page asking for the TV advert to stop, according to The Guardian. One wrote: 'What is the deal with the next advert! CHRISTMAS MUSIC? IN JUNE?! 'It's depressing enough as it is with Christmas stock coming in as earlier as it does!' Family: The supermarket chain has agreed to play the record only half as much in its stores . Waterbombs: Children play with waterbombs, as opposed to snowballs . Others however have praised the advert and even described it as 'really quite clever'. Helen Nunn, head of marketing at the Co-op Food, said: 'Love it or hate it, our latest ad has certainly got people talking, but, judging from our scorching sales over the Wimbledon weekend, the Andy Williams soundtrack isn't putting people off shopping with us! 'However, the ad, which plays on everyone’s emotional attachment to two key events – summer and Christmas – works best on TV, when you can see the lovely summer imagery with a seasonal twist, so we’ve taken comments about in-store radio on board and reduced the airtime for the Andy Williams classic.'","Supermarket using It's The Most Wonderful Time of the Year for summer ads .

Mystery: Convicted killer Simon Hennessey has been on the run since 1998 - police in Australia now believe he has been using fake identities to stay hidden . A British fugitive caught in Australia after 15 years on the run evaded capture for so long by stealing a brain-damaged man’s identity, it has been revealed. Convicted killer Simon Hennessey, 49, mutilated his aunt in a frenzied attack in 1978, stabbing her 70 times at her home in Plymouth. Hennessey, then aged 14, later admitted her murder on the grounds of mental illness and was jailed for life in the same year. But after serving 20 years he walked out of Leyhill open prison, in Gloucestershire, in December 1998, and effectively disappeared. Efforts to hunt him down are largely believed to have focused on Europe until police in Queensland, Australia, arrested him in April. Now it has emerged Hennessey lived a double life for years, taking the identity of a man from Hastings, New Zealand. He was caught using the name Robert Eric Jeffery when first arrested at an address in Tewantin on the popular Queensland Sunshine Coast. Hennessey has been charged with fraud understood to be linked to a sophisticated credit card scam running to tens of thousands of Australian dollars. Robert Jeffery, 44, was in a head-on collision with a vehicle in 2005 and thrown from the flat-bed truck he was driving. He has been in permanent care ever since and struggles to retain information. He has never held a passport. 'Three months ago, Don Jeffery, Robert’s father, received a call from the Department of Internal Affairs to say someone had been taken into custody on the Sunshine Coast with a passport in Robert’s name,' reports New Zealand's Hawke's Bay Today newspaper. Discovery: It is believed Hennessey, 49, had been using the identity of a man from the Hawke's Bay area of New Zealand (pictured) Don Jeffrey told the newspaper: 'I had heard of this happening but it’s shocking when it happens to someone so close.' Mr Jeffrey adds that he does not recognise Hennessey’s photograph and has no idea how he could have stolen his son’s details. 'We don’t know whether it was a chance encounter or whether he targeted Rob.' He added: 'He seems to have been using Rob’s identity to evade the law, not to rip Rob off. That was obviously our main concern, making sure Rob is protected. 'We’re not sure if this guy got his details before the car accident or afterwards when they knew what had happened.' Caught: Hennessey was arrested in Queensland, Australia (pictured), in connection with a sophisticated fraud scam in April . The newspaper also reports that after Hennessey’s prison escape in 1998 he is believed to have used the name Neil Docking to enter New Zealand. It states that police in the country have confirmed electronic items linked to Hennessey have been seized from a house in Hastings. Hennessey remains in custody in Australia after his last appearance before Maroochydore Magistrates’ Court on June 17. Avon and Somerset police have previously confirmed they have already contacted the authorities in Australia with a view to extradite Hennessey back to Britain.","Simon Hennessey, then 14, jailed for life in 1978 for murdering his aunt .

A young mother turned detective to get her violent boyfriend jailed after he avoided prison by faking a glowing reference. Gemma Jarman, 24, was angry when Jesse Fleischer, 38, was let off with a suspended sentence despite admitting beating her up in front of their toddler daughter at the home they shared in Southampton. Miss Jarman had seen how the judge at Winchester Crown Court had been impressed by a character reference from a hotel her boyfriend had worked at - a reference she knew was fake. Attacked: Gemma Jarman suffered a broken cheekbone and tooth in the assault by Jesse Fleischer, 38 . The intensive care nurse had suffered a fractured cheekbone and broken tooth in the attack, which left her and her daughter Freya, now two, 'living in fear'. She told police that Fleischer had not worked at the Marwell Hotel in Colden Common, Hampshire, for two months, and went on to prove that the letter was a forgery. Miss Jarman said: 'I was in court . when they read out the reference and I knew straight away it wasn’t . right - he wasn’t working there any more. 'He had been sacked on the day he battered me, and wrote the reference himself saying he was an amazing citizen. 'He . wrote that if he went to jail we would lose a great citizen of society . and that he should be dealt with in society and not go to prison. 'I’ve seen the letter since, and it’s all spelt wrong, there’s no grammar, and it’s signed off ‘Thank you’. 'Jesse simply brought this faked letter in on plain A4 on the day and handed it over - I was absolutely disgusted that he was allowed to walk away a free man the first time, I couldn’t believe it.' Jesse Fleischer, 38, is now in jail after the girlfriend he beat told police he had faked a character reference . Miss Jarman found out no-one at the hotel had written or signed the letter and told the police. She said: 'I went to the police and the officer I spoke to said: ""That’s not right, I’m going to fight for this"". 'They managed to get statements saying the hotel staff didn’t support Jesse in any way. 'That was lucky for me, because otherwise I would still be sitting here scared out of my wits.' Winchester Crown Court had heard how Fleischer ‘completely lost it’ when Miss Jarman tried to break up with him on March 13. Miss Jarman said: 'He begged me to stay but I couldn’t take it any more. 'He pulled me by my hair and pushed me onto the sofa and punched me about 12 times. 'I . was up against the wall, trying to get away from him, when he picked up . a statue from the mantelpiece and started swinging it around. Gemma Jarman, pictured before she was assaulted, told police her boyfriend had conned the judge . 'I . went to get a cloth from the kitchen for my face and he started saying . that if he couldn’t have us, his family, then nobody could. 'Freya was crying, but he only shouted ""Shut up, shut up, stop being stupid"". 'It was a terrifying attack and one which he subjected me to in front of our daughter, who was just 22 months old. 'He terrified my daughter and me.  We have been living in fear ever since, looking over our shoulders, fearing what he might do next. 'I just couldn’t let him get away with it.  I am just relieved he is finally behind bars and can live my life now - I have been living in fear for the last five months.' Fleischer, who had pleaded guilty to causing actual bodily harm and possessing cannabis with intent to supply in May, was brought back to court. The same judge, Recorder Michael Parroy QC, sentenced Fleischer to two years and four months in prison after he admitted perverting the course of justice. The judge told Fleischer he would have been locked up in the first place without the complimentary reference that he had faked. Miss Jarman said: 'The whole episode has been traumatising. I didn’t leave the house for the two months after Jesse attacked me because I was so in fear of him. 'When I moved to a different town to get away, he followed me, and I have a panic alarm fitted in my house in case he came here to hurt us again. 'I have only just managed to get Freya back into a routine and sleeping in her own bed again, for ages she wouldn’t step away from my side. 'I am so glad that he’s been put away at last.'","Jesse Fleischer, 38, beat Gemma Jarman, 24, at their Southampton home .

Prosecutors are to reconsider a decision not to bring charges in the case of Jimmy Mubenga after an inquest found he was unlawfully killed as he was deported from Britain. Mubenga, 46, was on a British Airways flight bound for his native Angola when security guards noticed he was not breathing and stopped the plane on the runway. The father-of-five later died in hospital and today an inquest jury recorded a majority verdict of unlawful killing. After the verdict was announced, the Crown Prosecution Service said it would now reconsider its original decision not to bring criminal charges in the case. Killed: Jimmy Mubenga, who died aged 46 after being restrained on a flight to Angola, was unlawfully killed, an inquest jury found today . Mr Mubenga, who was being deported after serving a jail sentence for committing actual bodily harm, was being restrained on the flight in October 2010 by three G4S guards, Terence Hughes, Stuart Tribelnig and Colin Kaler. They said they restrained him when he attacked one of them soon after boarding the plane . But the inquest jury, sitting at Isleworth Crown Court in west London, heard that Mr Mubenga was calling out for help and shouting that he could not breathe. Mr Mubenga died of cardio-respiratory collapse, where the heart stops beating and a person stops breathing, the inquest found. Other passengers on board the flight said they heard Mr Mubenga wailing for help after saying he could not breathe, with one of the guards apparently replying: 'Yes, you can.' No charges have ever been brought against the security guards, despite Mr Mubenga’s widow claiming that somebody ought to be held responsible for his death. Three G4S guards - Terence Hughes, Stuart Tribelnig and Colin Kaler - accompanied Mr Mubenga on the flight . The Angolan was being deported after he serving a prison sentence for assault. Mr . Mubenga and his wife, Adrienne Makenda Kambana, had been living in . Ilford, east London, after arriving in the UK from Angola in 1994. He was in the process of applying for . permission to stay in the country permanently when it was decided he . should be deported after serving two years in jail for assault . occasioning actual bodily harm. Returning the verdict of unlawful killing, the jury foreman said: 'Based on the evidence we have heard, we have found Mr Mubenga was pushed or held down by one or more of the guards. 'We find that this was unreasonable force. Adienne Makenda Kamana, Jimmy Mubenga's widow, said he was 'a good friend, a good man, a good husband' 'The guards would have known that they would have caused harm to Mr Mubenga, if not serious harm.' An . inquest jury of seven men and three women a recorded a majority verdict . of nine to one of unlawful killing after four days of deliberations . following an eight-week hearing. Mrs Kambana said outside court that her late husband was treated 'worse than an animal' on the flight, and called for deportations to be monitored better. She said: 'He was neglected on the plane worse than an animal.  What the witnesses said, they heard Jimmy asking for help. Nobody helped him. 'Jimmy should be here, but because he didn't get help, that's why he's not here.' She said although Mr Mubenga had served a prison sentence for assault, he did not deserve to die for his crime. 'It's not worse than someone killing someone, because he didn't kill anyone,' she said. 'He was a good man, a good friend, a loving husband. He treated me well.'

Scotland Yard Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe today apologised to Tory former chief whip Andrew Mitchell if his confidence in the Plebgate police probe had been damaged. Britain’s most senior police officer was questioned by the Home Affairs Select Committee over speculation about briefings he held with journalists in March. Mr Mitchell resigned after he was accused of launching a foul-mouthed rant at officers guarding Downing Street, including calling them 'plebs', which he denied. Apology: Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, left, apologised to Andrew Mitchell, right, if his confidence in the Plebgate investigation has been damaged . Conservative MP Mark Reckless asked the commissioner if he regretted holding the briefings, and added: 'In particular, would you apologise to Andrew Mitchell?' Sir Bernard replied: 'If it’s damaged Mr Mitchell’s, or anybody else’s, confidence in the integrity of our inquiry, then of course I’m sorry.' He said he told reporters he had concerns about the potential damage to the Met’s reputation, and that he could not account for news reports published days after the briefings. A few days after the meetings stories appeared in the Guardian and the Times suggesting there was no evidence that police lied about the affair. Sir Bernard said he was concerned over . whether it would be possible to establish who said what, over calls by . the Police Federation for a minister to resign and over allegations that . officers could have released information that was incorrect. In . an exchange about the force’s policy on meetings with journalists,Sir . Bernard said: 'More importantly, whichever way this went, it was not . going to be good for the reputation of the Metropolitan Police, (that) was my concern.' Controversy: The Plebgate row ignited when Mr Mitchell was accused of a heated outburst against police officers as he left Downing Street on September 19 . Eight arrests have been made as part of the investigation, known as Operation Alice, which has cost close to £200,000 so far. The Plebgate row ignited when Mr Mitchell was accused of the heated outburst against officers as he left Downing Street on September 19. Pressure intensified after the Daily Telegraph published a police log of the incident, which claimed he called officers 'plebs' and swore at them repeatedly. He insisted he did not use the words attributed to him, and later said he was the victim of a deliberate attempt to 'toxify' the Tories and ruin his career. An email from a civilian witness backing up the police account of events has also since been called into question. Some 30 detectives have taken statements from all 800 officers in the Diplomatic Protection Group (DPG) as part of the inquiry, which has taken nine months to date.","Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe appeared before Home Affairs Select Committee .

A wife overheard her husband raping his girlfriend when his mobile phone accidentally called her, it was revealed today. Matthew Stacey, 42, is starting a six-year jail term after being found guilty of carrying out the attack on Vittoria Di Franco, 34, of Ipswich, Suffolk, who has waived her right to anonymity. The car salesman abused Miss Di Franco and duped her into believing he was single when they started dating - even though he was still married, Ipswich Crown Court heard. Rape: Matthew Stacey (left), 42, is starting a six-year jail term after being found guilty of carrying out the attack on his victim Vittoria Di Franco (right, with Stacey), 34, of Ipswich, who has waived her right to anonymity . Miss Di Franco - who wants to  to encourage other rape victims to come forward - said: ‘I lived in fear. I was scared. When he lived with me my entire life revolved around his needs. 'By telling my story I want other women to come forward and stand up to abuse. Victims shouldn’t feel ashamed. I don’t hate him, but I really hate what he did. I used to put up with so much because I didn’t want to upset him.’ She said he would come home so drunk he could barely stand up, adding: ‘He was really abusive, but he was drunk half the time. He used to buy me things as if it was an excuse for what he had done. ‘He was very extreme. I went on holiday once with my mum. When I came back home he had chucked everything of mine out - the washing machine, the phone, cooker, kettle, iron, hoover’ Stacey’s estranged wife heard him raping his new partner when the speed dial on his phone was unwittingly set off during the attack, the court was told. Stacey and Miss Di Franco had met through dating website PlentyMoreFish, said Andrew Thompson, prosecuting. He pestered her until she agreed to see him in 2009, and they began a relationship. Mr Thompson added: ‘At times he would refer to her as the next Mrs Stacey.’ Jailed: Ipswich Crown Court (pictured) in Suffolk heard how Stacey had duped Miss Di Franco into believing he was single when they started dating, even though he was still married . But he said Stacey started acting differently towards Miss Di Franco after about five months. She suspected he was not being truthful with her and discovered he was still married. Stacey’s wife was surprised and upset when she found out they were seeing each other. But Miss Di  Franco, believing her relationship with him was a loving and enduring one, continued to see him. Stacey stayed at her home on a regular . basis. But they had highs and lows as he would get drunk and became mean . and spiteful. Stacey sexually assaulted her on one occasion, the court . was told.

Stacey felt she was taunting him as she had his phone, the court heard. He lost his temper and she fell on the bed with his mobile beneath her. Miss Di Franco shouted at crazed Stacey to stop, but he raped her. Mr Thompson said: ‘When he finished he retrieved the phone from the bed. At that stage he realised the phone had dialled someone, and the call had connected with his estranged wife.’ He said Stacey’s estranged wife Faith immediately recognised his voice and heard his victim pleading with him to stop. Stacey was convicted of assault by penetration and rape. Stacey was cleared of five other rape charges relating to Miss Di Franco. He denied all the charges. Miss Di Franco wanted to be identified because she said sex abuse victims should not be ashamed.

Barry George was today denied compensation for the eight years he spent in prison after being wrongly convicted of the murder of TV presenter Jill Dando. He claimed to be the victim of a 'miscarriage of justice' - but judges agreed with a minister that Mr George was 'not innocent enough' to be eligible for a pay-off. The decision at the Court of Appeal followed the dismissal of his compensation claim by two High Court judges in January who said he had 'failed the legal test' to claim a pay-off. Scroll down for video . Defeat: Barry George, left, has been denied compensation for being wrongly convicted of killing Jill Dando, right . Setback: A judge at the Court of Appeal decided that he was 'not innocent enough' to be compensated . Lord Justice Beatson and Mr Justice Irwin had rejected his argument that the Justice Secretary was wrong to decide he was 'not innocent enough to be compensated', ruling that the Secretary of State was 'entirely justified in the conclusion he reached'. Lord Justice Richards, sitting at the Court of Appeal in London, today rejected an application by Mr George for permission to challenge the January decision and said the 53-year-old had 'no realistic prospects' of success. Mr George was seeking a fresh examination of his case which could allow him to claim up to £500,000 from the State for lost earnings and wrongful imprisonment. Miss Dando, the presenter of Crimewatch, was shot dead outside her home in Fulham, West London, in April 1999. Mr George was convicted of murdering her in 2001, but was acquitted after a retrial in 2008. Victim: Miss Dando's real killer has never been identified after Mr George was acquitted of murder in 2008 . Barry George has been seeking compensation from the State ever since he was acquitted of Jill Dando's murder in August 2008. His initial claim was rejected in January 2010, but he launched a challenge to that decision based on a landmark Supreme Court ruling granting Andrew Adams compensation for the 14 years he spent in jail after being wrongfully convicted of murder. That case hinged on Section 133 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, which says that victims of a 'miscarriage of justice' should be compensated by the State. However, Justice Secretary Ken Clarke told Mr George that his case did not qualify, because he was 'not innocent enough to be compensated'. In January this year, two High Court judges agreed with Mr Clarke, denying him compensation because his conviction was not so unfair as to count as a miscarriage of justice. Mr George's lawyer had argued that 'no reasonable jury, properly directed, could have convicted on the evidence that was available to them', but the High Court judges concluded that this was incorrect and that a jury could reasonably have found him guilty. The decision at the Appeal Court today means that Mr George cannot challenge the High Court's decision any longer. After today's ruling, his sister Michelle Diskin said outside the Royal Courts of Justice that the Court of Appeal judge's decision was a 'travesty of justice'. With her brother standing by her side, she told reporters: 'There never was any viable evidence against Barry. 'This whole case from April 2000 until today has been a smoke and mirrors exercise designed to placate a worried public, and give the impression that justice had been done. 'Well neither the Dando family, nor our family, has seen any justice in the past 13 years.' She added: 'Serving eight years in prison for someone else's crime is not acceptable. 'Everything was taken from this man when the police started what we believe to be a malicious prosecution. He lost his home, his furniture, his clothing and all of his possessions, his place within his community and his church family.' Ms Diskin said the family would prepare to 'stand against this latest travesty of justice'. She . concluded: 'Barry is innocent. He deserves a financial settlement to . compensate for all that was taken from him - everything he owned and . eight years of his life.' During . today's hearing Ian Glen QC, representing Mr George free of charge, . submitted that the prosecution case against him was 'not viable and not a . case where a reasonable jury could have convicted'. In . arguing for permission to appeal, Mr Glen said: 'We seek an opportunity . to make out our argument to the Secretary of State that no reasonable . jury, properly directed, could have convicted on the evidence that was . available to them at the retrial'. But . the High Court judges concluded: 'There was indeed a case upon which a . reasonable jury, properly directed, could have convicted the claimant of . murder.' Scene of the crime: Miss Dando was gunned down outside her home in Fulham, pictured . Mr George's initial claim for compensation for lost earnings and wrongful imprisonment was rejected in January 2010. His legal challenge against that decision was put on hold until after a panel of nine Supreme Court justices gave their ruling in the case of Andrew Adams - a former aircraft engineer who spent 14 years in jail before his murder conviction was ruled unsafe. After the Adams ruling, Mr George was told by the Justice Secretary in June 2011 that he was still not entitled to compensation under Section 133 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. In January the High Court judges rejected Mr George's challenge along with three others, but they found in favour of Ian Lawless, who spent eight years behind bars for murder before being freed by the Court of Appeal in 2009. Mr Lawless was jailed for life in 2002 after confessing to the murder of retired sea captain Alf Wilkins on the Yarborough estate in Grimsby, Lincolnshire. The judges ruled that in his case the decision to refuse compensation was legally flawed and must be reconsidered in the light of their ruling. In Mr George's case the two High Court judges said: 'There was indeed a case upon which a reasonable jury, properly directed, could have convicted the claimant of murder.' Permission to appeal has previously been granted in the three other cases dismissed by the High Court and a hearing at the Court of Appeal relating to those is expected in October.","Barry George spent eight years in prison after being convicted of murder .

Finally behind bars: Jennice Lynch (outside Burnley Crown Court) burgled the luxury home of her mother and father three times in a month . A 20-year-old unruly daughter who was repeatedly let off by judges despite waging a ‘campaign of spite’ against her parents has finally been locked up for two years. Jennice Lynch, of Haslingden, Lancashire, burgled the home of her mother and father three times in a month - in one raid stealing a gold and diamond bracelet plus a £4,000 Jaguar watch. She was let off by a judge - but just four weeks after her mother Ruth criticised the suspended custody term and warned she would back in trouble, Lynch went on a shoplifting spree. The single mother of two was caught stealing wine, beer and spirits, but said she did it because she wanted to go to prison, adding: ‘I fancy a roof over my head and three square meals a day.’ A court heard she also then did not not turn up for probation appointments and instead helped herself to a charity box from a takeaway. Today she was finally behind bars after a judge said yesterday that she had ‘thrown back’ numerous opportunities that were given to her. She had earlier turned up several hours late for her hearing at Burnley Crown Court scruffily dressed, clutching a Lidl shopping bag and a lighted cigarette with ink on the back of her hand. Her father John, 46, a company director, attended the court hearing with another of his daughters during the morning - but they left thinking Lynch  would not turn up. The court heard Mr and Mrs Lynch, 45, had been deliberately targeted by her - even though they had tried to help her financially, bought her a flat and looked after her two young children. She would invade her parents’ £300,000 rural home in Whitworth, Lancashire, when they were out. In one break-in, her own children’s toys were showered with glass and had to be thrown away. Mr and Mrs Lynch, whose three other daughters are an accountant, a company manager and a university student, later told police they were disgusted with their daughter’s behaviour. They called for her to be locked up and said they had never had any problems with any of their other children. Thefts: Lynch would invade her parents' £300,000 rural home in Whitworth, Lancashire, when they were out. In one break-in, her own children's toys were showered with glass and had to be thrown away . But last March she was given a 22-month prison term suspended for two years after she admitted three burglaries. She promised there had been a ‘seachange’ in her behaviour. Dad: John Lynch, 46, father of Jennice, is pictured outside the court, where she was sentenced . But at the time housewife Mrs Lynch, whose husband runs an energy company, said: ‘The suspended sentence was a joke and she will see this as a reason to do it all again. ‘It will either be us or someone else she knows. Most people would be ashamed of themselves if they behaved this way but not our daughter. ‘She is uncaring and cold and it’s about time she got severely punished, because she needs a wake-up call. Anybody who she comes into contact with she falls out with because something has gone missing. 'We’ve tried to help her, teachers have tried to help her, and psychologists have tried to help her. But it’s been no use. The thieving has gone on for donkeys years, and going to court was our last resort - we just couldn’t go on.’ Just weeks after the suspended sentence was imposed, Lynch stole cider, wine, lager, Malibu and vodka from four shops in Bacup, Lancashire between April 14 and May 4. She was challenged twice, swore at one assistant, said: ‘Get out of my way’, and walked out of the premises. Ten days after that, on May 14, she was given a chance to attend supervision appointments but on June 10, she pinched the charity box, containing cash for local mosques, and ran away. It was later retrieved from behind the fridge at an address where she was staying. She was arrested and questioned and denied being responsible for each and every one of the thefts. Lynch continued to claim she was not . involved, even when shown CCTV - claiming shopkeepers were wrong. She admitted six counts of theft and breaching the suspended custody term. Custody: Jennice Lynch (pictured left in her police mugshot and right in a family photograph), 20, of Haslingden, Lancashire, was finally behind bars today after a judge said that she had 'thrown back' numerous opportunities . Mark Friend, defending, said his client had ‘had a very difficult relationship with her mother.’ He added: ‘For the last couple of weeks, for the first time in many years, the defendant and her mother have begun to make the tentative first steps towards building bridges in their relationship. ‘She tells me for the first time her mother is beginning to make arrangements for her to play an active and positive role in the lives of her children.’ Mr Friend said Lynch committed the thefts while subject to the suspended sentence because she wanted to go to prison, rather than feared it. Mother and daughter: A family photograph of Jennice Lynch (centre) and her mother Ruth Lynch (right) He said: ‘She was homeless. The idea of a roof over her head and three square meals a day was not something she was particularly fearful of. 'You have really thrown back at me the opportunity I gave you' Judge Jonathan Gibson . 'Now her life is beginning to turn around. She is all too aware of the difficulties she must overcome to build a stable and structured life for herself and her children.’ Sentencing, Judge Jonathan Gibson said she clearly had ‘multitudinous problems’, but had left him with little option. He said the final theft was committed after he gave her a last chance to comply with supervision. She will serve her sentence in a Young Offender Institution. The judge added: ‘In effect, by committing that offence and attending only two supervision appointments, you have really thrown back at me the opportunity I gave you. It’s inevitable a custodial sentence must follow.’","Jennice Lynch burgled parents' Lancashire home three times in month .

David Cameron has succeeded in fulfilling his pledge to increase spending on the health service every year, new figures show. The Prime Minister has come under pressure for his refusal to lift the ringfence protection from cuts given to the NHS while Labour has accused the coalition of failing to increase spending as promised. But new Treasury data published today show real terms increases in NHS spending in each year since the coalition was formed. Spending: New data released today shows how health spending has risen in real terms since 2010-11, after the coalition was formed in May 2010 . The figures, which cover actual spending from 2008-09 to 2012-13, lay bare that the only cut in spending came in the 2010-11 financial year which began in the last weeks of the Labour government. The Public Spending Statistics show that Health (NHS) spending increased from £104.405billioln in 2011-12 to £105.254billion in 2012-13. It amounts to a 0.8 per cent rise in real terms year-on-year. In 2011-12, health spending was 0.3 per cent higher than a year earlier. Ministers are confident that over their Spending Review period, the Government has continued to meet its promise to provide a real terms increase in the health budget. A Treasury source said: ‘Because of tough decisions this Government has taken on welfare we are able to increase NHS spending. ‘Labour claim protecting the NHS is irresponsible and would cut the NHS, like they have in Wales, where they are in charge.’ The figures will provide a major boost to Mr Cameron, who staked his personal reputation on a pledge not to cut health funding. Promise: Prime Minister David Cameron has been under pressure to stick to his pledge on health spending . During the 2010 election campaign the Tory leader appeared on a poster proclaiming: ‘Ill cut the deficit not the NHS.’ Ahead of the Budget and spending review this year there were renewed calls to remove the ringfence from health spending. But Mr Cameron suggested he would . never allow the NHS budget to be cut while he was Prime Minister. He . said: ‘When you look particularly at the NHS, you know that we have got . an ageing population. ‘There . is massive pressure on the NHS, more expensive treatments and drugs are . coming through, and I just don’t believe it is practical or right to . cut the NHS,’ Mr Cameron said in March. Row: Labour shadow health minister Jamie Reed repeated the claim that the coalition cut the NHS in its first year . ‘As prime minister I am never short of . advice. But there’s one piece of advice I won’t take and that’s the . piece of advice that says you ought to cut the National Health Service . budget.’ Last year the coalition became embroiled in a public spat with Andrew Dilnot, the head of the UK Statistics Authority, over the claim to have increased NHS spending each year. He argued that ‘expenditure on the NHS in real terms was lower in 2011-12 than it was in 2009-10’. But the coalition argued that the cut in 2010-11 was put in place by the last Labour government. In each year since Mr Cameron’s spending plans have been in place, health spending has risen. However, shadow health minister Jamie Reed insisted that the complaint from Mr Dilnot as still valid. He said: ‘David Cameron famously promised he would cut the deficit, not the NHS. ‘But we have it in black and white from the statistics chief: he cut the NHS in his first year in Government. ‘There could be no clearer evidence of the failure of this Prime Minister and his Government. ‘This mismatch between David Cameron's promises and the reality on the ground cannot be allowed to continue. These real-terms cuts explain why hospitals in England do not have adequate staffing levels and why over 4,000 nursing jobs have been lost on David Cameron’s watch.’","Treasury data shows health spending topped £105billion in 2012-13 .

She said: 'I was a bit embarrassed but I suppose I just laughed it off.' Embarrassment: Saskia Tikasingh told the General Dental Council how Mr Patel's comments made her feel embarrassed and she tried to laugh them off . She said the dentist had made similar remarks to her 'about three or four times'. Of Mr Patel’s clinical practise, she added: ‘He would use the same instruments the whole morning for his orthodontic patients.’ Mr Grey asked: ‘Did he sterilise those instruments between patients?’ Miss Tikasingh replied: ‘No’.

A trainee accountant may never walk again after he was shot by a motorist during a rush hour 'road rage attack'. Atif Ali, 27, got out of his silver Audi A3 to check for damage after a Ford Mondeo ran into the back of him. But as he went to speak to the Mondeo driver to swap details the motorist opened fire and Mr Ali was hit in the leg. The Mondeo then drove off. Mr Ali was taken to hospital in a serious condition and has undergone extensive surgery to save his leg. But doctors still do not know whether he still may be permanently disabled as a result of the shooting. Today Mr Ali's family offered a £15,000 reward for information leading to the capture of the gunman who struck in Luton, Bedfordshire which has been in the grip of a gang war following 11 shootings this year. The victim who studied at Nottingham University is highly respected in his community and regularly plays cricket. He recently organised a charity dinner where he helped to raise more than £50,000 for good causes. Mr Ali is not known to police and detectives are said to be baffled as to a motive for the shooting amid fears he was targeted by mistake. The incident occurred at 8am on May 20 this year when Mr Ali left the home he shares with his elderly parents to go to work. Bedfordshire Police said his silver Audi was followed by a black Audi and the silver Mondeo registration number YM02 XYJ. Do you know this man?

Mr Ali's car turned left at a road junction only for the Mondeo to plough into the rear end of the victim’s car as it followed.

In a statement, Mr Ali's brother Amjid Ali said: 'Atif, my family and I are still waiting to find out why this happened to him. We are all at a loss as to the reason why. 'Atif is 27 years old, he is single and he works as a trainee accountant at a company in Hertfordshire. 'He lives with my elderly parents and has two brothers, including myself, and three sisters.

Damning Evidence: Carlos Ortiz appears for a hearing at Attleboro, Mass., District Court, Tuesday, July 9, 2013. Ortiz told police that Hernandez allegedly admitted to firing the shots that killed fellow football player Odin Lloyd in June . Dramatic court documents released on Tuesday allegedly state that former New England tight end Aaron Hernandez confessed to Odin Lloyd's murder. Filed in Florida and obtained by the Associated Press, the documents also reveal the chilling last moments of the semi-pro footballer on the morning of Lloyd's June 17th shooting. According to the 156 page unsealed documents, Carlos Ortiz, 27, informed police that Ernest Wallace, 41, told him that the former Patriots player admitted firing the shots that killed Lloyd. Hernandez, Wallace, Ortiz and Lloyd are all believed to have been traveling in the same vehicle. Furthermore, Ortiz told police exactly what happened on that June morning. He said that along with Wallace and Hernandez they picked up Lloyd at his Boston home and were headed towards Hernandez's home in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. Ortiz claims that Hernandez had become upset that Lloyd had been 'chilling' with individuals that Hernandez did not approve of - but the two men apparently shook hands and agreed to let the argument go. However, Ortiz told police that the car then stopped and Wallace, Hernandez and Lloyd got out to urinate upon which Ortiz said he heard gunshots and only Hernandez and Lloyd got back into the car. Search: . Ernest Wallace, of Miramar, Florida (center), stands next to his . attorney David Meier, (left), and a court officer, (right), in Attleboro . District Court, in Attleboro, Mass., during his arraignment, Monday, . July 8th, 2013. Wallace is facing an accessory to murder charge in the . case involving former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez . The documents were filed on Tuesday in Florida to justify searching Wallace's home after he was arraigned on charges of being an accessory after the fact in Attleboro District Court on Monday. They also reveal that police . found a spent shell casing in a Chevrolet Suburban rented by Hernandez that had been fired from . the same pistol as five empty shells found near the victim's body. When asked about the vehicle, Hernandez told police that he had rented it for 'O', who he identified as Lloyd. Lloyd's body was found with the keys to the rented car in his pocket. The documents filed on . Tuesday in Miramar, state that while investigating Lloyd's killing, . police conducted searches in Hernandez's hometown of Bristol, . Connecticut and found the Chevy which is wanted in connection with a July 2012 double . homicide in Boston. Police have said they still do not have a motive for the murder of Lloyd. The Boston Globe reported last month that Lloyd was believed to have known about Hernandez's alleged involvement in the 2012 double murder of Daniel Abreu and Safiro Furtado and Hernandez reportedly killed Lloyd to keep him quiet. Allegations: Carlos Ortiz, (center), is shown during a hearing in court in Bristol, Connecticut, on Friday, June 28th, 2013 . Hernandez, who was released by the Patriots last month, is being held without bail and has pleaded not guilty to the murder of Lloyd, 27 and five weapons charges. Carlos Ortiz, 27 has been charged with the illegal possession of a firearm and Ernest Wallace, 41, is up on charges of being accessory after the fact. Odin Lloyd, 27, who played semi-pro football . for the Boston Bandits, was shot dead in the early morning of June 17th - . his body was found by a jogger at 5.30 p.m. that day. The court documents included an autopsy showing that Lloyd had been shot several times and that two projectiles consistent with .45 caliber ammunition were recovered from his body. At an apartment rented by Hernandez in Franklin, Massachusetts - half a mile from his North Attleboro home -  police discovered five boxes of .45 caliber cartridges, according to the documents. During an earlier search of Hernandez's home, investigators found an Hungarian rifle with an attached magazine in a black gym bag on the back seat of a Toyota sedan parked in the garage. They confiscated video footage from the residence that showed two men in the driveway changing their clothes by the car, a silver 2012 Nissan Altima, apparently rented by Hernandez on the night of the murder. Other footage showed three men entering the house. Accused: Aaron Hernandez, formerly of the New England Patriots looks during a game against the Seattle Seahawks in 2012 - The football player is accused of killing Odin Lloyd (right) in June of this year . Hernandez has pleaded not guilty in Lloyd's killing. His legal team did not return email messages Tuesday. In total, 156 pages of documentation released, police outline the cold and callous nature of Hernandez when they arrived at the football players home at 10.30 p.m. on June 17th to inform him about the death of Lloyd and ask him about the car he rented for the man he called 'O'. Police said that Hernandez immediately became agitated by questions about his whereabouts the night before, asking 'What's with all the questions?' The documents show that when asked when last he saw Lloyd, Hernandez replied that the deceased had been 'up his way', the night before. However, police say that Hernandez displayed signs of nervousness and told officers that they would need to speak to his attorney, closed his door and locked it. Minutes later he re-emerged with his attorney's business card, handed it over to police and again close and locked the door. Intriguingly, when told by the police 'this is a death investigation', Hernandez apparently failed to inquire who had died. 'Mr. Hernandez's demeanor did not indicate any concern for the death of any person,' the documents state. It was only after he contacted his lawyer that Hernandez agreed to speak to police and traveled to North Attleboro police station in Massacusetts to be interviewed. The warrants reveal the breadth of the investigation, with authorities scouring through everything from Hernandez's house to his phone to the contents of his team locker, which the Patriots emptied into a container after they released him.

In addition, three Apple iPads, an iPhone and a cellphone containing LLoyds number under 'Dis N***A' and 'N***a Dis'. They also reveal that Hernandez's girlfriend, Shayanna Jenkins may have let police known that Odin Lloyd was a marijuana smoker and dealer.

A weight-lifting champion and Raoul Moat fan beat his girlfriend 'black and blue' after she chose to spend the day at Ascot instead of with him, a court heard. After repeatedly hitting the 22-year-old with his fists and allegedly whipping her with a belt, bodybuilder Gareth Davies - who has represented Great Britain in power-lifting - then forced Jamie-Lee Cooksey to clean up the blood left splattered around the apartment they shared in Surrey, a court heard. Davies, who at one point yanked Miss Cooksey off the floor by her hair, was jailed for two years and four months after admitting assault causing actual bodily harm. Jailed: Bodybuilder Gareth Davies, 31, beat his girlfriend Jamie-Lee Cooksey in an hour-long ordeal, then made her clean up the blood left splattered around the apartment they shared . Passing sentence, Judge Peter Moss told the aircraft engineer: 'You are a very big and powerful young man. One can only imagine how terrifying it must have been for Miss Cooksey.' Guildford Crown Court heard Davies, who had previously compared himself to killer Raoul Moat, was on licence from prison where he had been serving a 25-month sentence for a similar attack on a former girlfriend at the time of the incident. 'That previous incident bears strong similarities to the one currently before this court,' said prosecutor John Upton. On June 19 last year a row erupted between Davies and Miss Cooksey, who is from Fife in Scotland, at their flat in Redhill, Surrey. 'Miss Cooksey had made plans to go to Ascot with her mum for the races. But the defendant was unhappy about that and accused her of being selfish,' Mr Upton said. 'Unhappy': The court heard Davies lost his temper with his girlfriend because she had decided to spend the day at Ascot with her mother instead of with him . Mr Upton told the court Miss Cooksey . abandoned her day out after getting a call to tell her that Davies was at the . local railway station and was depressed. She met him there and they returned to together to their apartment, where Davies turned on his girlfriend, the prosecutor said. 'He picked her up by her hair and proceeded to hit her repeatedly,' said Mr Upton. 'Then he punched her repeatedly with his fists before thrashing her with a belt.' Comparison: A court heard Davies had previously compared himself to bodybuilding gunman Raoul Moat . During the hour-long ordeal, Davies told the petrified victim: 'I don’t want to assault you but you’ve pushed me to it.' 'He then made her clean up the flat because it was covered with her blood,' Mr Upton said. When . Davies, from Chertsey, had calmed down, Miss Cooksey sent a . text to her mother which read: 'Call the police or I’m not going to survive.' She eventually managed to flee the apartment and take refuge at a local newsagents, the court heard. The court heard Davies had been jailed in April 2011 for two offences of assault causing actual bodily harm and three of assault with intent to resist arrest after throttling his one-time partner Lucy Barrett, then 24, and going on a rampage at the Holiday Inn in Shepperton during a fit of rage. On that occasion Miss Barrett, speaking from behind a witness screen, told the court how Davies, had often spoken about Moat and compared his own situation with his. She said: 'He told me everyone had got it wrong about Raoul Moat, he didn’t go mad because of the steroids - he went mad because he had a diddy girlfriend and no one listened to him.' 'He said that he would go on a killing rampage because his family didn’t listen to him, or support him,' she added. Davies initially denied responsibility for the attack on Miss Cooksey, and said she took cocaine, was 'bi-polar', and that her injuries had been the result of her doing cartwheels while wearing high-heeled shoes. James Mason, defending, told the court his client now accepted inflicting the injuries, but denied the use of a belt. He said Davies had problems with his pituitary gland and was taking 11 different forms of medication. In a victim impact statement, Miss Cooksey said she had been left 'traumatised' by her ordeal. Jailing Davies, who was once sent to prison for armed robbery, Judge Moss said the assault and the defendant’s comments bore all the classic hallmarks of serious domestic violence. 'She was black and blue on her arms,' he said. Judge Moss added: 'This is a bad case. Miss Cooksey said she was going off for a day at the races. It was the trigger for you to abuse her.'","Bodybuilder Gareth Davies picked girlfriend up by hair and hit her repeatedly .

Heated exchange: A transcript of the insults traded between Bulger and Weeks . Judge Denise Casper had to step in and restore order. She reminded Bulger that his lawyers are to speak for him in court. Weeks says he decided to cooperate and testify after learning that Bulger and Flemmi were longtime FBI informants. He is on the stand for a second day in Bulger's trial for allegedly participating in 19 murders in the 1970s and 1980s.

The defendant (Bulger): F**k you, too. The witness (Weeks): What do you want to do? The Court: Hey. Mr Bulger. Mr Bulger, let your attorneys speak for you. Bulger has pleaded not guilty, and his attorneys had not had a chance to cross-examine Weeks, a former enforcer in Bulger's Winter Hill Gang. In the past, they've challenged his credibility and criticized the plea deal Weeks received from prosecutors in exchange for his testimony. Week served five years in prison for being an accessory in five murders and other crimes. On Tuesday, Weeks said he was at a South Boston house with Bulger in 1985 when he heard a thud. He said he then saw Bulger choking 26-year-old Deborah Hussey, the stepdaughter of Bulger's partner, Stephen ‘The Rifleman’ Flemmi. Weeks said Flemmi then strangled her with a rope after he realized she was still alive. Weeks also said Hussey and two other murder victims were buried in a basement but later moved. He said he led authorities to the bodies in 2000. During testimony Monday, Bulger only occasionally glanced at his former right-hand man as Weeks described how Bulger opened fire on a car and killed two men in 1982. The Donahue family, including Michael Donahue's widow Patricia and son Tom, right, arrive at court for the trial of accused mob boss James Whitey Bulger at the U.S. Federal Courthouse in Boston, Massachusetts . Weeks testified that Bulger donned a wig and mustache, drove a souped-up ‘hit car’ and pumped bullets into Edward ‘Brian’ Halloran, whom he had heard was cooperating with authorities against him, and Michael Donahue, an innocent bystander who happened to offer Halloran a ride home that night. Weeks said he saw Bulger pull up to the car Halloran got into as he left a restaurant in South Boston. ‘He slid across the front seat and he yelled out, “Brian!” and he proceeded to start shooting,’ Weeks said. When he called Bulger later that night, Bulger said he was eating dinner with his girlfriend and urged him to ‘go get something to eat,’ Weeks said. Donahue's son Thomas, who has attended every day of the month-long trial with his mother and two brothers, said hearing Weeks testify about the killing of his father had shaken his family. ‘It tears you apart hearing the horrific story,’ he said.

Detective Sergeant Panicos Monk, pictured outside Norwich Magistrates Court, where he admitted harassment without violence and was given a 24 month community order . A female detective said she felt like a prisoner in her own home after a jealous police sergeant subjected her to two months of harassment when their relationship broke down. Detective sergeant Panicos Monk, a highly commended officer who served in Suffolk Police’s investigation management unit, left his wife and children to begin a relationship with detective constable Petrina Webb in 2009 after they met at the force’s Martlesham headquarters, Norwich Magistrates’ Court heard today. But when their three year relationship ended, Monk, 44, of Bedfield, Suffolk, launched a campaign of harassment beginning on Valentine’s Day this year. Over two months, he sent her almost 200 abusive text, Facebook and email messages, prosecutor Ben Brighouse said. Suspecting she had met somebody else, he hacked her account on the social networking site to spy on her. On one occasion he pulled his car in front of hers, forcing her to stop on a busy road, the court heard. She locked herself in the vehicle and when a member of the public came to her aid, Monk showed his warrant card and told them there was nothing wrong. Eventually she managed to drive to safety at police headquarters. Afterwards Miss Webb became suspicious that Monk was following her in his car. Monk admitted harassment without violence and was given a 24 month community order and ordered to attend a programme to improve his behaviour in relationships.

He now faces disciplinary action after being suspended by Suffolk Police (HQ pictured) He was also made subject to a three year restraining order and must pay Miss Webb £500 in compensation. The officer, who previously served in the Navy and had received numerous commendations during his 19-year police career, will now face disciplinary action after being suspended by Suffolk Police. In a statement read to the court, Miss Webb said: 'When I realised he had been silently monitoring my private emails and Facebook accounts, I went cold. 'I hadn’t thought to change my password when we separated and, although I had nothing to hide, nobody wants to be spied on like that. 'I feel like a prisoner in my own home and felt compelled to take measures to improve my security. 'I park my car as close to the door as possible and have had my door locks changed. 'I leave my lights on at night and take an alarm to bed with me. I can’t go out walking alone in my own village.' The stress became so bad that Miss Webb was signed off work for seven weeks and is still undergoing therapy, magistrates were told. Emma Collins, mitigating, said that the pair had a 'toxic' on-off relationship. She added that Monk was 'totally devastated and mortified' by the prosecution. 'This is particularly devastating for Mr Monk and will have a detrimental impact on his employment,' she added. 'This is a man who acted totally inappropriately but out of desperation.'

Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy views his successor Francois Hollande as a ‘ridiculous little fat man who dyes his hair’, it emerged today. The vicious attack is reported by l’Express, the highly respected Paris news magazine whose editor is a close friend of Mr Sarkozy’s third wife, Carla Bruni. Barely disguised hatred between the two politicians has been well documented, but this is the first time that Mr Sarkozy’s bitter language has been reported in public. Mutual dislike: Nicolas Sarkozy, pictured left, has described his successor Francois Hollande, pictured right, as a 'ridiculous little fat man who dyes his hair' According to the magazine, Mr Sarkozy told a friend: ‘You’ve seen him, this ridiculous little fat man who dyes his hair. Do you know men who dye their hair?’ Mr Sarkozy, a 58-year-old conservative, was roundly beaten by the portly Socialist, who is also 58, in last year’s presidential election. When Mr Sarkozy was head of state Ms Bruni put him on a fitness programme aimed at making him leaner, fitter and younger looking. Before that Mr Sarkozy, who is only 5ft 5ins, was himself mocked for being a chubby little man. He continued to wear platform heels, and to surround himself with smaller men in an attempt to look taller, but lost a great deal of weight through constant work-outs and giving up chocolate. Mr Hollande, in contrast, has failed to . lose the tubby image which has seen him nick-named Flanby, after a . custard pudding popular in France. Handover of power: Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni leave the Elysee Palace after Francois Hollande, pictured in the background with his partner Valerie Trierweiler, was sworn in as President . Mr Hollande has also made an effort to lose some pounds, and his hair has got noticeably darker over the last few months. Like Mr Sarkozy, he has a younger partner – his girlfriend is 48-year-old divorcee Valerie Trierweiler – and is only too well aware of how important it is to maintain a dynamic image. Mr Sarkozy infamously collapsed while out jogging during his presidency, and only managed one term in office. He was widely disliked by millions of voters, and within a few days of losing his presidential immunity from prosecution saw the house he shares with Ms Bruni raided by anti-corruption police. Mr Hollande is fairing equally badly as his tax-and-spend policies create economic disaster for France. Opinion polls already reveal that Mr Hollande is the most unpopular president in the history of the Fifth Republic, with Mr Sarkozy a close second.","Nicolas Sarkozy was .

His 75-year-old wife has been bailed while officers await instructions from the Crown Prosecution Service on how to treat the case. Thames Valley Police’s handling of the death appears to be unprecedented, as those taking the life of a victim are usually investigated for murder or manslaughter. Assisted suicide ¿ or actively helping someone to kill themselves ¿ is illegal under the 1961 Suicide Act (STOCK IMAGE) The body of the man, named by neighbours as John Sampford, a retired coach-painter, was discovered when police were called to a house at Bancroft Park, Milton Keynes, in the early hours of Friday. Police arrested his wife, Sheila, but released her on bail until a date next month. They are not looking for anyone else in relation to the death which post mortem results indicate was caused by strangulation. The couple had been happily married for 50 years. Mr Sampford had been diagnosed with leukaemia and was said to have been given only three months to live. Assisted suicide – or actively helping someone to kill themselves – is illegal under the 1961 Suicide Act. Conservative MP Mark Pritchard, who is vice-chairman of the Parliamentary Pro-Life Group, said: ¿If a crime has been committed the police must investigate'. Detective Chief Inspector Vince Grey, who is leading the investigation, said: ‘We are now consulting with the Crown Prosecution Service as to how this case should be carried forward. Our focus is to establish the exact circumstances around the death to best understand what and how it happened.’ But MPs last night criticised Thames Valley Police for an apparent ‘positional shift’ in deciding how an apparent homicide should be investigated. Conservative MP Mark Pritchard, who is vice-chairman of the Parliamentary Pro-Life Group, said: ‘If a crime has been committed the police must investigate. It is not the police’s job to write the law, that is for Parliament. And it is not the police’s job to interpret the law, that is for the courts.’ Tory MP Nadine Dorries, who has also been campaigning on pro-life issues, said: ‘This case should be treated as murder. The law states that assisted suicide is illegal.’ New guidelines on how to handle assisted suicide cases were issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer, in 2010. The guidance, issued after MS-sufferer Debbie Purdy sought legal assurances that her partner would not be prosecuted for helping her die, states: ‘Assisted suicide refers to helping someone take his or her own life . . . taking someone’s life, as opposed to, helping them to take their own life, is murder or manslaughter.’ The CPS said: ‘We have had contact with Thames Valley Police, but we have not received the file yet.’","A man, named as John Sampford, was found in Milton Keynes .

A British climber has scaled a 3,000ft rockface considered to be one of the most dangerous in the world - despite being blind. Steve Bate, 35, has become the first registered blind person to conquer the El Capitan monolith in California. The former climbing instructor spent six days hauling himself up the granite slab in Yosemite National Park and spent the nights sleeping in a hanging hammock. Mr Bate was diagnosed two years ago with degenerative eye condition retinitis pigmentosa and is legally registered blind. Scroll down to watch video . Going solo: Steve Bate has become the first ever registered blind person to climb one of El Capitan's most dangerous routes called Zodiac, pictured, solo . Climbing over all obstacles: Steve Bate, 35, from Elgin, Moray, was diagnosed with a degenerative illness called retinitis pigmentosa two years ago and is registered blind . Determined: Steve Bate, who was told he would be completely blind within five years of his diagnosis, wanted to complete the climb before losing his sight altogether . He said: 'It was really tough and when I finished I couldn't really understand where all my strength had come from. 'It took a couple of days for me to recover from the exhaustion of it all, but I am so glad I did it. The feeling when I got to the top was just incredible and I am so happy with how it went.' Mr Bate, from Moray, Scotland, lugged more than 100kg of equipment with him on his ascent and experienced a rollercoaster of emotions throughout the expedition. At one point he almost threw in the towel after hearing a climber friend's girlfriend had been hit by a car. He said: 'Spending so much time on my own, going through the motions over and over, had me making more mistakes than I would usually make because my guard was down. Gruelling: Steve Bate had to haul 100kg of equipment with him on the 3,000ft climb in California .

'I fell twice on the climb and it was so hot out there, I became tired a lot quicker than I had accounted for.' Mr Bate's incurable eye disease is slowly destroying his sight from the outside inwards, a condition known as 'tunnel vision'. He has been told by specialists that he will be completely blind within three years. 'My eyesight hasn't been completely right for up to 10 years but I was only diagnosed two years ago,' he said. 'Now I have completely lost my peripheral vision, so it's like looking down a tunnel. 'I had to make a lot of changes to my lifestyle. For example, my driving licence got taken away and I couldn't go mountain biking anymore because it was too dangerous. Not for the fainthearted: The entire climb took Steve Bate six days so he slept in a hanging hammock at night .

'But climbing is something I really love, so I hope I never have to give it up. I'm certainly going to make the most of it, while I still can. 'When I was diagnosed two years ago, I was told that I could expect to be completely blind within five years, so I wanted to do the climb before it was too late.' The bike charity project manager is the first blind person to conquer the granite monolith solo along the challenging 'Zodiac' route, in a bid to raise money for sight charity North East Sensory Services. Mr Bate, who is married to Caroline, said: 'I'm not sure I will ever realise what I have done, being a climber it's just another great climb.

High-street shoppers watched in disbelief as a 'frail pensioner' leapt over benches, did backflips and even performed a handstand on a moving escalator. The wrinkled man, who said he was 90-year-old Jim Cook, stunned passers-by as he leapt between pillars and bounced off walls in the sleepy Hampshire town of Basingstoke. Little did they know that they were in fact watching 27-year-old professional freerunner, Chase Armitage, performing stunts for a video he was making. Scroll down for video . Chase Armitage, 27, spent three hours disguising himself as a 90-year-old before leaping over benches . He's HOW old? Shoppers in Basingstoke gawp at the professional freerunner disguised as a frail OAP . Mr Armitage spent three hours with a professional make-up artist who used £5,000 of prosthetics to transform him into a wrinkled elderly gentleman who looked as if he'd find getting up from his armchair challenging enough. A cardigan, specs and balding head with wispy hair were enough to make the athletic young man completely convincing. Daredevil Chase, who is a professional free-runner, then took to the streets of his home town of Basingstoke, Hants, dressed as his character Mr Cook. Mr Armitage is a member of the well-known freerunning group 3RUN, who filmed the stunt to make a video to encourage people to exercise. He said: 'The prank worked best when . we performed it just once or twice and quickly moved on, leaving . people looking puzzled. 'The . guys I was with told those who asked that I'd invented free-running . and was still obsessed with staying healthy and in good shape. Mr Armitage put some work into fooling his audience, puffing and panting and pretending his back hurt .

Not your average 90-year-old: Mr Armitage filmed his stunts for a video that will encourage people to exercise . Chase Armitage as he usually looks, left, and how he looked with the prosthetics and make-up applied, right . 'At the bottom of the escalator I really built up the tension, making it look like I would struggle to even walk up it. 'I think it’s fair to say people were more than a little surprised when I then climbed it on my hands.' Freerunning, also known as parkour, involves performing gymnastic stunts on street furniture and buildings, and has its origins in late 1980s France. Mr Armitage, who has been freerunning for 13 years, also visited a local gym, where he impressed personal trainers with his dead-lifts, flips, and pull-ups. He said: '""Jim"" added to the illusion by limbering-up before each jump and dramatically holding his lower back as if it was stiff whenever he landed. Leaping over benches at the shopping centre, Mr Armitage drew some gasps from the afternoon crowds .

Video director Scott Young, 24, said: 'A few elderly people bought it, and it was funny how the younger generation really fell for it as well.

Before the rise of vast service stations and faceless coffee chains, hungry drivers relied on traditional truck stops like Peggy's Diner and the Blue Sky Cafe to refuel them on long journeys. Once a familiar sight along the UK's road network, such independent cafes have been all but wiped out by sprawling services, prompting one photographer to take to the road and document the surviving stops where motorists can enjoy a hot drink and a bacon sandwich - and still have change from £3.50. Snapper Sam Mellish downed 'hundreds' of cups of tea as he travelled 6,000 miles along the UK's major A-routes in a bid to capture the 'open road feeling' with his series of images of the last remaining roadside cafes. Fuelling travellers' journeys: Independent roadside cafes - like the Orchard Cafe on the fringes of Greater London - are a dying breed, but a photographer has travelled the length and breadth of the country to capture the remnants of a bygone era . Quaint: Traditional roadside truck stops like Peggy's Diner in Antrim, Northern Ireland, have largely been replaced by sprawling service stations . 'We spend much of our lives on the road commuting, working, setting off on holiday, or just drifting,' Mr Mellish said. 'I wanted to capture the open road feeling, like songs such as Route 66 or the Road To Hell. 'I have travelled more than 6,000 miles, used 800 litres of petrol - and I have drunk hundred of cups of tea and bacon sarnies,' he said of his project. 'But . these independent places are under threat - several of those I . photographed at the beginning of the project have since closed down.' Historians and architectural experts echoed Mr Mellish's concern for the 'fast disappearing' cafes. Catherine Croft, director of The Twentieth Century Society, described them as a 'unique and irreplaceable part of our heritage'. 'They . may not be attributed to named architects but they have been seen by . thousands of visitors originally introducing them to new styles and . materials,' she said. 'Often it is the way that everything is designed from the building down to signage and napkins that makes them so evocative. 'Sam’s images capture a world whose passing is happening so quietly that it is in danger of vanishing without record. 'We . can learn as much from these modest buildings as grand ones and these . cafes tell a wealth of stories about how we have travelled, relaxed and . sped on our way through the twentieth century,' Ms Croft said. Pit stop: The sight of this burger shack is no doubt a welcome one for many a hungry motorist on Bodmin Moor in Cornwall . Postcard perfect: Sam Mellish trekked 6,000 miles along the UK's major A routes to document traditional roadside diners - including the picturesque Blue Sky Cafe in Norfolk, which overlooks the coast . Welcome sight: The Farm Cafe, on the A17, has been refuelling motorists for more than half a century, having been established when the parents of the current owner set up a tea stop on the side of the route . Trucker's salvation: Rustic looking cabin the Midway Stop serves food and beverages to drivers heading along the eastbound A14 in Suffolk . No-frills: This shack-like roadside cafe is a far cry from the sprawling service stations that have sprung up along the country's motorways in recent decades . Faded: Traditional roadside cafes are a 'unique and irreplaceable' part of the country's architectural heritage, according to the Twentieth Century Society . Value: The photographer said he wanted his series of images to capture the 'open road feeling' summed up by songs like Route 66 or the Road to Hell . Social and cultural historian Joe Moran . said: 'Before the M1 opened in 1959 there were no service stations and . roadside variety reigned. 'Well-to-do motorists used to visit road houses - lavish hostelries that boasted swimming pools, ballrooms and even polo fields. 'Lorry drivers swore by the greasy spoon transport cafes like Kate’s Cabin on the A1 and Berts on the A30. 'Then came service stations which became bland corporate spaces like roadside shopping malls,' Mr Moran said. 'Even the A roads, which used to be the last redoubt of the transport cafe, are now being colonised by chain owners. 'But there are still parts of the British roadside that resist the pull of sameness and blandness. 'When . they first opened motorway service stations were stylish places where . young people would would drive at high speeds to play pinball and drink . Cona coffee. 'But as operators . began to cut costs service stations became a notorious land of un-swept . floors, sticky tabletops and congealed food slowly dying under . hot-lamps. Now they have become almost like airports - clean, efficient and expensive,' the historian added. 'A corporate owned mono-culture now increasingly rules the roadside.' These images in more are seen in Mr Mellish's book, Roadside Britain, published by Diesel Books. Roadside Britain: Mr Mellish travelled thousands of miles and drank 'hundreds' of cups of tea during his efforts to document the UK's last remaining roadside cafes . Influence: The design of OK Diners like this one is inspired by the iconic roadside cafes that crop up along America's highways . Character: They may be small - like the Popham Diner on the A303 in Hampshire - but Britain's roadside cafes boast vast car parks ideal for trucks and coaches .

They are typically found floating in the ocean's depths - so just how did this octopus end up 978m above sea level at the peak of England's tallest mountain? A team of litter pickers carrying out a clean-up on Scafell Pike were left baffled when they came across the body of a dead octopus nestled on the rocks close to the mountain's summit. Mystery surrounds the manner in which the dead sea creature came to land on the lofty perch in the Lake District - with some suggesting the cephalopod was dropped by a bird after being scooped up from the Irish Sea. Mystery: The dead octopus was discovered by a team of litter pickers carrying out a clean-up near the summit of Scafell Pike - England's highest mountain . It would have taken a powerful bird to haul the octopus - which measured around 10 inches from the top of its head to the tip of its tentacles - so high in the air. The Cumbria beauty spot is home to nesting Osprey, and sea eagles have recently begun to colonise the area thanks to a breeding programme in Scotland. But Dave Ascough, who discovered the dead creature, suspects its presence on top of the mountain may have been the result of a prank. Bizarre: Could a bird have dropped the dead sea creature at the summit of the Scafell Pike in the Lake District? 'It appeared quite fresh, but I suppose it could have been someone's idea of a joke,' he said. 'If not that, it raises the question of why the bird would carry it all the way up the top of the mountain and then lose it and not eat it. 'But I am not an ornithologist, so it remains a mystery,' he said. Mr Ascough, from Stockport, was taking a party of volunteers up Scafell Pike to clear away litter left by other visitors when he stumbled across the bizarre find. The trained mountain leader, who said swathes of litter is left behind on the mountain by tourists and climbers taking part in the popular Three Peaks Challenge, said his team brought ten black bags of rubbish down with them off Scafell Pike that day - including the octopus. 'It is easily the most unusual thing we have found on Scafell Pike - we were quite surprised when we came across it,' he said. 'We were just at the summit cairn where it was quite windy and misty and I saw something on a rock which I thought was a child's toy - a teddy bear or a glove puppet. But on going over to it I realised it was a dead octopus. 'Last year on Ben Nevis I did find a . whole trout in a carrier bag near the summit cairn. So my first . reaction when I saw the octopus was that someone carried it up as some . kind of as a prank. 'Then . I gave it some thought and realised it was possible that a bird had . somehow dropped it, though it would have to have been a big bird.' The . octopus was put into a black sack and disposed of with the rest of the . rubbish, by being dumped in a skip at the foot of the mountain.

A Connecticut man who says he lost an eye after being shot . in the face by murder suspect Aaron Hernandez in February has been ordered to . testify before a grand jury in Massachusetts that is investigating the former . New England Patriots star. Hernandez has been charged with first-degree murder in . connection to the execution-style death of 27-year-old Odin Lloyd, who was . found gunned down June 17 in an industrial park not far from the football . player's home. Superior Court Judge Joan Alexander in Hartford on Friday . ordered Alexander Bradley, 31, to appear July 17 in Fall River. Eyewitness: A judge ordered Alexander Bradley, 31, to testify in connection to Aaron Hernandez's murder case after the Connecticut man had filed a lawsuit against the football player accusing him of shooting him in the face . Former friends: Bradley (left) claimed in his federal suit that Hernandez (right) discharged his unlicensed gun at him after an argument in a strip club in February, causing him to lose his right eye . Bradley had been fighting an interstate subpoena, asserting . he needed to return to Florida for medical treatment, which involves cleaning . his prosthetic eye and making adjustments to it so it could track his vision, The Hartford Courant reported. In a lawsuit filed four days before the discovery of Lloyd’s . body, Bradley claimed that he was shot by Hernandez with a handgun as they were . driving in Florida after getting into a heated argument in a Miami nightclub. At the time, he told police he did not know who had shot him. According to Florida police, a bullet struck Bradley in the . face February 13 while he was riding in a car with Hernandez and two other men . from Tootsie's strip club in Miami, where the two friends got into a . dispute. Bradley's civil suit seeking at least $75,000 in damages states . that Hernandez's gun, which the football player allegedly had no license to . carry, discharged. The bullet went through Bradley’s arm and struck the 31-year-old . man in the face, causing him to lose his right eye. Legal woes: Hernandez (center) has been charged with murdering a friend execution-style last month . Timeline: The body of Boston Bandits football player Odin Lloyd, 27, was found June 17 near Hernandez's home just four days after Bradley had filed a lawsuit against his former friend . 'It has been enucleated - replaced with a prosthetic eye,' his attorney David Jaroslawicz told ABC News. 'He has also lost use of his . right arm.' The injuries, which have been described in the lawsuit as 'permanent . in nature,' resulted in several operations, leaving Bradley struggling to . ingest food and in pain. On the morning following the shooting, Bradley was . discovered bleeding from his head and arm in an alley near a John Deere landscaping . business in Riviera Beach, Florida, according to NBC News. When first responders and police officers arrived on the . scene, the victim reportedly refused to name the person who shot him while . denying that his wounds were self-inflicted. Jaroslawicz believes that his client had been dumped alone . in an industrial park because Hernandez and the other two men who were with them . thought 'he would be dead.' While being treated in a West Palm Beach hospital, Bradley . told police he only knew he was shot by 'black and Hispanic' men. The . 31-year-old then stopped cooperating with investigators, causing the case to . become inactive. Only four months after the shooting, Bradley named Hernandez as the alleged gunman in his federal lawsuit. High stakes: The grand jury that will hear Bradley's testimony will be tasked with determining whether Hernandez is to be formally indicted . The lawyer said last month that his client would like to find . out if Hernandez had fired the gun at Bradley on purpose. According to . Jaroslawicz, Bradley and Hernandez had known each other for several years, and . his client thought the former Patriots star was his friend, USA Today reported. Hernandez is being held without bail in the Bristol County . Jail after entering a not guilty plea. The grand jury will determine if he will . be formally indicted on the murder charge. Mr Bradely is expected to offer his testimony before the . grand jury panel at 9am on July 17. Two weeks before Bradley was shot in Florida, Massachusetts . State Police arrested him for drunken driving and speeding on Interstate 93, . while Hernandez was apparently a passenger in the car, according to court . records, according to Boston.com. Troubled: Bradley served time in prison on a drug conviction, was arrested for drunken driving in February and is now accused of punching his ex-girlfriend in the face . On Tuesday, the 31-year-old appeared in Hartford Superior . Court in Connecticut on unrelated charges that he punched his ex-girlfriend in . the face.

Moving on: Patriots fans lined up by the hundreds to exchange their Aaron Hernandez jerseys for any other player free of charge . ‘They're going to lose a lot of money on this, but that's what makes it one of the best organizations definitely in the NFL,"" Mike Vitelli told the Boston Globe.Fans echoed Vitelli’s sentiment, saying that the team is doing the right thing.‘I think it’s a great thing the team is doing,’ Andrew Keating told the Globe, ‘What [Hernandez] did was a pretty awful thing.’ Classy move: The Patriots are offering a new jersey to all fans who want to get rid of the one they bought with Hernandez's name . Trade: This fan wore his Aaron Hernandez jersey to the trade-in, there was no word on whether he wore his new jersey out of the pro shop . The jersey exchange comes on the heels of yet another search of a Hernandez property in the past few days, according to reports.The latest property to be searched in connection with the murder of Odin Lloyd has been characterized in reports as a ‘flop house’ rented by the player for a mere $1,200 a month.Details released this week of that search, conducted June 26, were pretty grim. Investigators are said to have found 11 boxes of ammunition, a bag from Kay Jewelers, paychecks from both the Patriots and Puma, a valet receipt from a downtown Boston hotel, a Hertz rental agreement – a rental car in Hernandez’s name was found in the vicinity of Lloyd’s body – a Western Union receipt and two set of keys to a brand new Hummer in the disgraced star’s name, according to the Boston Herald. The search warrant also reportedly indicated cops were looking for cocaine, but there is no evidence of any drugs being found during the search. Gone: The Patriots are trying to help fans move on from their fallen star by offering a free jersey bearing any other player's name in exchange for a Hernandez jersey. Accused: Hernandez being led away from his Attelboro, MA home by Massachusetts State Police . Also, authorities are examining Hernandez’s tattoos, of which he has many, for signs of any past or present gang affiliations.Two associates of the accused murderer have been arrested and officials are also looking into possible involvement in a double murder in Boston last summer, according to reports.‘I think it’s a good idea, and it gives everyone a chance to wear a player that they are pretty proud of,’ Marta Hernandez later added.The most popular jersey so far has been defensive lineman Vince Wilfork, according to the Herald. Star quarterback Tom Brady and linebacker Chandler Jones were close behind. The exchange runs through the weekend.It's not clear what the team plans to do with the unwanted Hernandez jerseys, multiple attempts by Mail Online to reach a Patriots spokesperson were unsuccessful.","The team announced the free exchange after the star player was charged with murdering Odin Lloyd .

Ed Miliband has spoken for the first time how he used to go out with BBC economic correspondent Stephanie Flanders - some months before she had a relationship with Ed Balls. The Labour leader, who admitted he was a ‘late developer’ when it comes to women, denied it was weird that he had dated the same journalist as his shadow Chancellor. The relationship is believed to have happened in the 1990s, after they had left university. But, until now, Mr Miliband has been unwilling to speak about the affair, which happened many years before he met his wife Justine. Ed Miliband denied it was strange he dated Stephanie Flanders (left), who also went out with Ed Balls . The Labour leader spoke about his love life in an interview with Now magazine - but he admitted that it did not get going until he left home and started university. Asked whether he had had many girlfriends when he was young, Mr Miliband replied: ‘Not really. I was a late developer.’ The magazine then asked him whether it meant he was not like Nick Clegg, who claimed that he had slept with ‘no more than 30 women’ before he met his wife. ‘I’m not going to compare myself to Nick Clegg in any way,’ he said. ‘I was quite square and serious. Girls came a bit later - university and after.’ Miliband has not spoken about the relationship before, which ended years before he met wife Justine (pictured) Hot or not? Ed Miliband brushed off claims his brother David (right) is 'hotter', insisting his own wife disagreed . Mr Miliband was then asked whether it . was ‘weird’ that he had shared a girlfriend - Stephanie Flanders - with . Ed Balls, he said: ‘We did both date her but there was a long time apart . between me and Ed. ‘Stephanie and I don’t have any problems running into each other now.’ Oxford-educated .

Ed Balls and Miss Flanders are believed to have had a relationship in the mid-1990s . Miss Flanders is believed to have had her relationship with Mr Balls in the mid-1990s, when the pair worked as journalists on the Financial Times. The relationship with Mr Miliband happened before this. In the interview with Now magazine, the Labour leader denied he was upset that people say his brother David is ‘hotter’ than him. ‘I think my wife thinks I’m hotter,’ he said. ‘If she didn’t I’d be worried!’ Mr Miliband married his wife Justine Thornton, a former child actress, in 2001. They have two sons - Daniel and Samuel. He told the magazine that they met at a friend’s dinner when he was with someone else. They stayed in touch and then started going out when he was campaigning to be a Doncaster MP. He recalled: ‘She was helping put out chairs for a campaign meeting and these ladies were there saying: “You didn’t come all this way just to put out chairs, love!” ‘Quite quickly I got to the point where I thought: “I can’t imagine my life without Justine”. ‘I really feel so lucky. She’s so much the rock of my life. It sounds a bit corny, but I wouldn’t be doing this job and I wouldn’t be happy without her.’ The Labour leader said he preferred brunettes to blondes - ‘I’d be in trouble if I didn’t say that’ - and revealed he prefers M&S underwear to designer brands. Mr Miliband also used the interview to confirm he his fighting ‘the battle of the bulge’, and that his wife often stops him going outside wearing horrible clothes such as ‘big jumpers, nasty corduroys’.","Ed Miliband had a relationship with Stephanie Flanders in the 1990s .

"By . Guy Adams, Ryan Kisiel and Tim Shipman . PUBLISHED: . 18:36 EST, 8 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:37 EST, 8 July 2013 . Labour faced fresh claims of union abuse last night as it emerged that ethnic minority candidates have been passed over in favour of trade union-supported white candidates. The party briefly suspended the selection of candidates for council seats in the south London boroughs of Southwark and Lambeth after claims black and Asian applicants were discriminated against. Four highly qualified black women filed official complaints against Labour officials after not being selected for the shortlist to represent the party in Lambeth. In Southwark, where deputy leader Harriet Harman has her parliamentary seat, the former black mayor, who has been deselected, accused Miss Harman of failing to uphold her claims to support equality. Althea Smith (left) says she was ditched by local party and Harriet Harman's son Joe Dromey (right) The revelations deepen Labour’s internal crisis after it emerged that members of Len McCluskey’s Unite union conspired to stitch-up Labour’s candidate selection in Falkirk. One black woman who was not selected as a councillor candidate in Lambeth told the Mail: ‘We attend our local ward meetings all year and see the same faces. 'Then suddenly, when it came to councillor candidate selection, all these new faces turned up. They were voting for the other candidate. ‘One woman had a high-powered job and was a trade union member with lots of political friends. The panel interviewing us were all white and it just seemed a fix. ‘We complained and had an appeal interview, but it was a sham and predetermined.’ Well-connected: Joe Dromey, 28, is the son of trade union baron Jack Dromey (pictured) A second rejected black candidate added: ‘I know of seven applicants who were rejected at the first round. They were all black. The only person I know who got through was a white man. He just happens to be backed by Unite.’ Lambeth is one of the most ethnically diverse boroughs with 50 per cent of voters coming from a minority. But out of its 40 councillors, only nine of them are black or Asian. In Southwark, Councillor Althea Smith says she was deselected by her local Labour Party in favour of trade union-backed candidates. She said: ‘People came from outside the borough who have connections to trade unions and MPs and were selected. These are the people who want to become career politicians. ‘Harriet Harman wants equality, but she wants her own brand of equality.’ The controversy comes as Miss Harman’s son was selected last week to stand for Labour in Lewisham, south-east London. Joe Dromey, 28, is the son of trade union baron Jack Dromey, who was deputy general secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union before becoming Labour treasurer and an MP. Simon Woolley, director of pressure group Operation Black Vote, said he was concerned at the high number of black candidates being struck off. He said: ‘The affair in Lambeth, in particular, is worse than a shambles. It’s absolutely shocking and shameful.’ Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Day by day fresh evidence emerges of how an unelected union baron is tightening his stranglehold on the Labour Party.’ A Labour spokesman dismissed the complaints, pointing out that losing candidates with a grievance have surfaced around the country since the furore blew up about Falkirk. However, many of the complaints in south London pre-date the controversy. The spokesman added: ‘We are satisfied that selections are being carried out properly and any suggestion otherwise is wrong.’","Four black women filed official complaints against Labour officials after not being selected for shortlist in Lambeth .

A Victorian space observatory where some of the world’s earliest photographs of the moon were taken has been saved. Photographic pioneer John Dillwyn Llewelyn took early pictures of the moonscape in 1857 from the observatory. The 'nationally important' building on the Penllergare estate, near Swansea, South Wales, was crumbling after years of neglect. Historic: A neglected space observatory on the Penllergare estate, South Wales, where some of the world's earliest photographs of the moon were taken has been saved . Photographer: Wealthy industrialist and renaissance man John Dillwyn Llewelyn (pictured) built the observatory in 1846 . Important: The building (pictured in the 1800s) was crumbling after years of neglect . But it has now been saved by a £2.9m Lottery Heritage Fund restoration project. The astronomical observatory was built in 1846 by wealthy industrialist and renaissance man John Dillwyn Llewelyn - a founder member of the Royal Photographic Society. After installing a telescope in the building, he and his daughter Thereza captured some of the earliest photographs of the moon. Llewelyn was a noted botanist, scientist, abolitionist and a health campaigner as well as a world-renowned photographer. Pioneering: A photograph of the moon taken from the observatory in 1857 . Saved: The historic observatory and surviving estate woodlands have been saved by a £2.9m Heritage Lottery Fund grant . Site: Llewelyn inherited Penllergare house and estate in 1833 and built the astronomical observatory in 1846 . Family: After installing a telescope in the building, John Dillwyn Llewelyn and his daughter Thereza (pictured) captured some of the earliest photographs of the moon . Queen Victoria and Prince Albert bought many of his pioneering works to add to their growing photographic collection. Prestige: Llewelyn was also a noted botanist, scientist, abolitionist and a health campaigner . His invention of the Oxymel process - the use of honey and vinegar to instantly preserve images - in the 1850s meant landscape photographers could do away with cumbersome portable laboratories and darkroom tents. Llewelyn’s industrialist family owned the Cambrian pottery in Swansea, South Wales, and he inherited Penllergare house and estate in 1833. He died in 1882, aged 72, and by the 1930s the house and estate began a period of decline. For more than half a century the Penllergare estate was almost forgotten and the mansion was destroyed and replaced by council offices. But now the historic observatory and surviving estate woodlands have been saved for the nation by a £2.9m Heritage Lottery Fund grant. Penllergare Trust chairman Terry Jones said: 'The observatory is the scientific legacy of John Dillwyn Llewelyn. 'It has survived over half a century of neglect along with the picturesque designed landscape garden in the valley below. 'We’re looking forward to bringing this nationally important historic structure back into good condition and conserving it for public benefit.' The Victorian era saw an increase in peoples' interest in space and astronomy as technologies improved to allow those with a growing amount of wealth and leisure time to follow such pursuits. Rebekah Higgitt, curator of history of science and technology at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, said a number of observatories opened across both Europe and America during this time. She said: 'It was the 19th century that saw a real explosion of the number of observatories in Europe and America and Britain was very much part of that. 'In Britain in particular that has been driven by amatuer astronomers who are wealthy enough to fund observatories themselves for their own interests.' Ms Higgitt said astronomers at the time developed interests in using photography and spectroscopy as ways of exploring the heavens.","Observatory on Penllergare estate was crumbling after years of neglect .

Two food-loving students have come up with an ingenious way to tempt unadventurous peers into the kitchen with the creation of a naked cookbook. Kinvara Hubbard and Mimi Williams decided to bare all in a brave bid to coax their fellow students away from the bar. The two, who are both 21 and childhood friends from Cambridge, came up with the quirky concept after realising traditional cookbooks were gathering dust in university accommodation across the country. Budding chefs: Kinvara is a Philosophy student at the University of Edinburgh and Mimi is midway through a four-year course studying French and Law at the University of Leeds . Naked chefs: Kinvara Hubbard (L) and Mimi Williams (R) decided to bare all for a naked cookbook in a brave bid to coax their fellow students away from the bar and to cook more . The book, which also features a number of the girls' student friends in the altogether, includes everything from nude skiers at the top of Arthur’s Seat, a giant peak in Edinburgh, to stripped-down sportsmen pumping iron in a gym in Leeds, all spicing up the pages of the cookbook, which otherwise offers fairly bog-standard recipes like bean casserole and spaghetti Bolognese. The girls, whose book has already stirred a lot of interest amongst fellow students, admitted it was not hard finding willing volunteers for their project. Kinvara said: 'Everyone asks if it was tough to find students who were willing to strip, but that was the easy part - it was getting them to put their clothes back on that was the hard part. 'We were at a party where we realised we had all been given a cookbook by our parents when we went away to university but out of 30 of us only two had even opened them. 'It's amazing how clueless students are when it comes to cooking - I had one friend who even asked me how to peel a carrot once.

'Mimi and I had picked up some kitchen skills during a summer catering job so that night we decided to come up with a way of making cooking fun and making a cookbook that appealed to students. 'We thought we’d try and emphasise the social aspect of cooking and bring back dinner parties as students love to watch Come Dine With Me. 'Hopefully the pictures are eye-catching enough to make sure the book isn’t just used as a coffee coaster for three years. 'It’s a cookbook put together by students, for students, so it’s completely idiot proof.'

Kinvara . is a Philosophy student at the University of Edinburgh and Mimi is . midway through a four-year course studying French and Law at the . University of Leeds. Mimi added: 'It’s been a steep learning curve. Fun way to learn: Alongside the quirky pictures are simple recipes for student staples including spaghetti bolognese, curry, toad in the hole and even a step-by-step guide on how to boil an egg . 'We’ve had to learn to balance degree work and finishing the cookbook which has definitely been tough - especially during our exams. 'We had a lot of late nights and a lot of help from friends and family but it’s been fun throughout.' Alongside the quirky pictures are simple recipes for student staples including spaghetti Bolognese, curry, toad in the hole and even a step-by-step guide on how to boil an egg. Kinvara added: 'Both our universities were very supportive and all our friends got involved. 'One photoshoot involved the rugby team with cakes tactically placed to cover their modesty. 'Afterwards the whole team went outside and played a game of naked rugby out on the field despite it being a freezing day in February. 'We had 60 of our friends strip off during a crazy two weeks of photoshoots - it was the most surreal fortnight of my life but the end result was definitely worth it.' The girls are donating £1 from every book sold to homeless charity Crisis in recognition of the work they do in university cities across the country.

One in five Tory members is thinking of voting for the UK Independence Party at the next election, a poll has revealed. More than half feel they are not respected by David Cameron, despite years of service to their local Conservative associations. And many feel alienated by some of the Prime Minister’s flagship policies, with 59 per cent saying they oppose gay marriage and 67 per cent opposed to increases in the budget for foreign aid. Switching: More than 800 Conservative party members were asked to rate how likely they were to vote for UKIP at the 2015 election from 0 to 10 . Threat: David Cameron, pictured at Wimbledon yesterday, is warned his party members are ready to defect to support Nigel Farage's UKIP . The findings came in a YouGov poll of . 852 members for Queen Mary, University of London, Sussex University and . the McDougall Trust pressure group. The survey revealed only 19 per cent . of members believe Mr Cameron will lead the party to victory in 2015. The rare insight into feeling among the Tory activists will make for worrying reading for party strategists. It reveals a growing disconnect between Mr . Cameron and his members, with almost half saying they now spend no time . campaigning for his re-election as Prime Minister. Many of them are actively considering switching to back UKIP, in a major boost for Nigel Farage’s party. The damning verdict comes just two months after party relations were shattered by claims a senior Tory figure had dismissed activists as 'swivel-eyed loons'. Mr Cameron was forced to publicly declare his support for party members after the insult was used to explain why Tory MPs voted against gay marriage plans, under pressure from their local associations. Unpopular: Coalition policies on gay marriage and ring-fencing international development from cuts are opposed by Conservative activists . The research was carried out by YouGov for Queen Mary, University of London, Sussex University and the McDougall Trust. It is unusual to see surveys of party . members because lists of names are not released, but the polling firm . has identified 852 individuals from its previous work. The . study emerged as former Defence Secretary Liam Fox stepped up his . attacks on the European Union, attacking the political class in Brussels . for 'fanning the flames of frustration' by failing to listen to fears . about immigration across the EU. European commissioners are ‘paving the way for extremists’ by turning a blind eye to increasing concerns about immigration, Liam Fox warned today as he called for a policy that puts ‘the British people first’. The former Defence Secretary attacked the political class in Brussels for ‘fanning the flames of frustration’ by failing to listen to fears across the EU and warned it could have ‘dangerous’ consequences. In a speech to the Centre for Policy Studies in London he also called for reforms that would make it easier for international workers with skills needed in Britain to enter the country but tougher for those that are a ‘burden’ on the state. He indicated a green-card style system could be introduced as part of an ‘open and shut’ immigration system. ‘Nobody should assume they have the right to come to our country because they have relatives already here or because they happen to reside in some remote corner of the European Union,’ he said. Respondents were asked to say whether . they would consider voting for UKIP on a scale of one to 10, with the . top rating indicating a definite ‘yes’ and 0 meaning they would ‘never’ defect. Some 19 per cent gave a score of eight or above, while nine per cent said they would definitely switch. Only a fifth (19 per cent) think the . Conservatives will win an overall majority in the 2015 general election, . with 10 per cent predicting a second coalition with the Lib Dems.

A body pulled from the Missouri River has been identified as a 64-year-old father who plunged to his death while hand-in-hand with his 29-year-old daughter in March. The man, who has still not been identified to the media by family members, jumped from the Christopher S. Bond Bridge with his daughter and their pet Chihuahua four months ago. His body was found on May 10 by a fisherman at La Benite Park, around 15 miles west from the bridge. His daughter's body has never been recovered.

More than 674 people have complained to the BBC after presenter John Inverdale suggested Wimbledon winner Marion Bartoli was 'never going to be a looker' The BBC presenter who made disparaging comments about Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli has been labelled a ‘sexist moron’ by viewers. The corporation has received 674 complaints and was forced to issue a grovelling apology after John Inverdale said the French star was ‘never going to be a looker’. He tried to draw a line under the matter the following day by explaining his comments on air and sending an apologetic letter to Bartoli. But even though the player said the incident ‘doesn’t matter’, Inverdale has been hit by a furious backlash from listeners, who said his apology was ‘inadequate’. Many took to social networking site Twitter to express their disgust, with some demanding that he resign. Inverdale, 55, who anchored the BBC’s TV coverage of the Wimbledon championships, made his comments during an interview with Radio 5 Live ahead of Saturday’s women’s final. He said: ‘I just wonder if her dad, because he has obviously been the most influential person in her life, did say to her when she was 12, 13, 14 maybe, “listen, you are never going to be, you know, a looker. “You are never going to be somebody like a (Maria) Sharapova, you’re never going to be 5ft 11in, you’re never going to be somebody with long legs, so you have to compensate for that.’ Inverdale attended the champions’ dinner at London’s Park Lane Hotel on Sunday night. He greeted Andy Murray’s mother, Judy, with a hug and a kiss. French champion Miss Bartoli, 28, disproved the presenter’s theory when she arrived at the event looking glamorous in a figure-hugging black dress and heels. She brushed off his remarks, saying: ‘It doesn’t matter, honestly.’ But many listeners were not so happy to let the matter drop. Writing on Twitter, one said: ‘Inver-dale’s sexist remarks makes me sick in the stomach BBC.’ Another added, ‘John Inverdale is such a chauvinist’; while others said, ‘This isn’t a “gaffe” – the commenter is a sexist moron’, and ‘You should be ashamed.

Her frantic midnight calls from the panic button round her neck were missed by Bexley Emergency Link Line (Bell) because only one worker was on duty, and he had been logged out of the system. It was not until five hours later, just before 6am on April 6 last year, that the council employee logged back in again. By this time Mrs Baker was dead. A former telecoms engineer who used . to install the systems for Bexley Council claims he warned bosses such . an incident could happen back in 2007. John Cousins, who worked for Bexley Council at time of Barbara Baker's death, with a log of her failed calls. Mr Cousins, who was not the agency worker involved, was critical of the system . Her calls from Meadows Court . sheltered housing complex, in Sidcup, went through to the . lone operator at Bexley Civic Centre but he missed it, causing the . computer system to log him out of 'call receiving mode' after three . minutes. A post-mortem concluded Mrs Baker died of natural causes but it was not attributed to the lack of response to her alarm and there was no inquest. Telecoms engineer John Cousins, 54, said a single person should never have been left in charge of the system. He . added CCTV staff who used to be on the same corridor as the Bell . operators and would cover for them when needed were moved elsewhere in . 2010. He said: 'Why gamble on having one operator? To me it's just reckless having one person working on a particular night. 'The . weakest link should always be the customer not wearing their pendant, . not the council having just one member of staff on because they can't . afford more.

Mr Cousins, of Bexleyheath, says the operator was promising but was inexperienced and had not been trained to deal with the situation he was confronted with. The operator was immediately sacked, though a police investigation found insufficient evidence to charge him with any crime. Mr Cousins was himself fired in July last year over an unrelated case of 'gross misconduct', though he feels he was forced out by the council over the incident with Mrs Baker. Bexley Council in south-east London, which operates the 24-hour response system, has apologised 'unreservedly' to the family of Barbara Baker. However, it claims Mr Cousins did not alert the council about problems prior to Mrs Baker's death. Meadows Court, where Barbara Baker lived when she died of natural causes, after her panic calls went unanswered . The council said: 'Following a post-mortem examination, it was concluded Mrs Baker died of natural causes. 'The lack of response by Bell was not an attributable factor in Mrs Baker's death, and the case did not progress to an inquest. 'The Bell staff and managers were very upset this incident happened and the council has apologised unreservedly to Mrs Baker's sister for the distress it caused.' 'Mr Cousins was not party to this incident and is speculating on a situation while not being in possession of the full facts. 'He did not alert managers, prior to the incident, that there could be a future issue. 'The operator on duty that night, an agency worker, has not been employed by the council since. 'The agency worker had been given full training on the Bell system and had even been given extra, specific training on what to do should the system ever lock out. 'Due to the low workload, the system was previously monitored overnight by one operator.

Elizabeth Surrey has appeared in court accused of misconduct in public office after concerns were raised over her behaviour while working at HMP Chelmsford . A female prison officer accused of having an inappropriate relationship with an inmate has appeared in court. Elizabeth Surrey, 25, from Chelmsford, Essex, is accused of misconduct in public office after concerns were raised over her behaviour while working at HMP Chelmsford between March 11 and April 5. The charge relates to claims she sent cards, letters and emails to a serving prisoner, received a personal phone call from the convict, showed the prisoner her cleavage and removed his ID card from the category B jail and failed to return it. She appeared at Chelmsford Magistrates’ Court this morning but entered no plea. Surrey, who has been suspended from duty, spoke only to confirm her name and address. She was released on unconditional bail until the next hearing at Chelmsford Crown Court on September 16. HMP Chelmsford is a Category B men's prison and young offenders' institution. The prison began as a county jail in 1830 but was later transformed into a Category B prison, a young person's prison and a local prison in 1987. It was expanded in 1996 to relieve overcrowding but in January the Ministry of Justice announced parts of the prison would close. The charge relates to claims she showed her cleavage to a prisoner at Chelmsford (file picture) and sent the convict cards, letters and emails . The decision meant there would be a reduction of 132 places at the site. The Chief Inspector of Prisons criticised the management at the prison in 1999 after finding staff were failing to respond to cell alarms. In 2005 however, Chelmsford was praised for improving standards and procedures for inmates.

Malta cancelled two flights to return migrants to Libya after the European Court of Human Rights issued an interim measure banning repatriation. The court's written decision was handed to Prime Minister Joseph Muscat on Tuesday evening as he addressed parliament about his concern over a growing migration crisis. He said more than 400 migrants, many from Somalia and Eritrea, had arrived on the island of 400,000 people in less than a week, with many having started their journey across the Mediterranean in Libya. Order: Malta cancelled two flights to return migrants to Libya after the European Court of Human Rights issued an interim measure banning repatriation. Pictured: Would-be immigrants rest on a patrol boat after arriving at Haywharf in Valletta's Marsamxett Harbour . Decision: The court's written decision was handed to Prime Minister Joseph Muscat on Tuesday evening as he addressed parliament about his concern over a growing migration crisis. Another three boats were being monitored, he said. The summer months usually see a steady stream of often rickety migrant boats arriving on the shores of Malta and the island of Lampedusa, off Sicily, seen as a gateway to Europe for migrants fleeing war and poverty at home. The European court's order was issued on Tuesday after an emergency request by non-governmental organisations citing media reports that the government was planning to send the migrants back to Libya. The groups said this amounted to so-called 'push back' - a practice declared illegal by the court last year after it was used by Italy in 2009 under then prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. Supporters of the groups had gathered outside police headquarters, threatening to block buses taking migrants to the airport. Bated breath: Members of several non-governmental organisations working with immigrants listen on a radio to Malta's Prime Minister Joseph Muscat making a statement in parliament, following the European Court of Human Rights' urgent interim decision . Determined: NGOs working with immigrants hold a protest outside the Malta Police headquarters in Floriana, outside Valletta yesterday . Muscat said Malta would respect the decisions of the court and international treaties but would consider all options to safeguard its interests. He confirmed his government had been in contact with the Libyan authorities about sending the migrants back to Libya, but denied it amounted to 'push back'. 'This is not push back, it is a message that we are not push-overs,' he told the Times of Malta website. Muscat accused the European Union was not showing solidarity with Malta over issue and had earlier warned that Malta was prepared to use its veto on unrelated issues in EU matters to bring about a change. The EU commissioner for home affairs, Cecilia Malmstrom, said that, according to EU and international obligations, all people arriving in EU territory were entitled to file an asylum request and to have a proper assessment of their situation. She said the EU stood ready to increase support to Malta if it should face growing pressure from the influx.","Decision handed .

Murder for hire: Julia Merfeld, 21, pleaded guilty to soliciting a murder after she was caught on hidden camera hiring an undercover detective to kill her husband . Julia Merfeld, a 21-year-old married mother of two from Michigan, did not want to break her husband’s heart by divorcing him – so she decided to have him killed instead, according to investigators. Merfeld has pleaded guilty to soliciting the murder of her 27-year-old husband following an investigation that included videotaped meetings with an undercover police detective posing as a hit man. On the video, the Muskegon resident is heard telling the undercover officer that the killing would be ‘easier than divorcing him.’ Merfeld said that she and her husband had been fighting, and that she had been thinking about having him killed for a while because if he was dead, she wouldn’t have to worry about her family’s judgment or ‘breaking his heart.’ Two videos made in April were released to The Muskegon Chronicle by prosecutors. The 21-year-old woman pleaded guilty June 27 to soliciting a murder. She’s jailed ahead of sentencing July 30 and is expected to face up to a life in prison. Authorities say she wanted her . husband’s $400,000 life insurance policy, and promised to pay the . would-be hit man $50,000 for the killing in several $9,000 installments. Police became aware of Mrs Merfeld's plot to have her husband killed when they were tipped off by her co-worker, Carlos Ramos. According . to Ramos, the 21-year-old woman offered him $50,000 for the hit, but he . called police and helped set up a meeting between Merfeld and an . undercover detective posing as a prospective assassin. The . woman and the man she thought to be a gun-for-hire met on April 9 and . 10 in his car. Unbeknownst to Merfeld, both meetings were recorded on a . hidden camera. Scroll down for undercover video . Sting: Merfeld's co-worker tipped off police about the woman's deadly plot and helped set up a meeting between her and an undercover officer posing as a prospective hit man in April . In cold blood:  The young married mother could be seen smiling broadly and laughing while discussing how and when her husband would be killed . Scheduling: At one point, Merfeld pulled out her smartphone to choose the perfect day on the calendar for her husband's murder . Detail-oriented: Merfeld could be seen ticking off on her fingers the items she has to bring for her next meeting with the hit man the following day . In the videos, the 21-year-old mother of two could be seen grinning while discussing the details of the hit on her 27-year-old husband in a detached, matter-of-fact way. 'When I first decided to do this … it’s not that we weren’t getting along,' she says on the video. 'But … terrible as it sounds, it was easier than divorcing him. 'You know, I didn’t have to worry . about the judgment of my family, I didn’t have to worry about breaking . his heart, all that stuff like this. It’s, like, how I got a clean . getaway.' During the two . meetings, the woman calmly tells the hit man that the best time to kill . her husband would be on a Thursday. At one point, she could be seen . checking the calendar on her smartphone covered with a Batman sticker . for the optimal date for the assassination. Getting . down to details, Merfeld explains that she is reluctant to stage the . murder as a burglary gone awry because she is worried that it would . scare off her friend, whom she wanted to move in with her after her . husband's death. During . the second meeting on April 10, Merfeld, sporting a Batman sweatshirt . and a pair of pink sweatpants, stresses several times that she does not . want her spouse to suffer, and that she wants him to die as painlessly . as possible. She even . suggests to the would-be assassin that the best method would be to break . her husband's neck, but the undercover detective tells Merfeld that he . would prefer to use either a gun or a knife. In . response, the 21-year-old chooses the gun and calmly says ‘OK’ when the . detective tells her that he will shoot her spouse in the face. Final preparations: Merfeld turned up for the second meeting with hand-written notes outlining their floor plan and the directions to their home . Blood money: The 21-year-old was asked to pay the assassin $100 as a down payment on the $50,000 contract . Moment of doubt: During her second meeting with the 'killer,' Merfeld appears to have second thoughts about the plot (left), but she quickly goes back on track with the plan to have her husband shot in the head . Merfeld says that she doesn’t want to know exactly when or how the murder would happen and that ‘it would better if you surprised me.’ ‘The more shocked I am when it happens, the better,’ she tells the hit man. ‘I just want to make it as non-suspicious as possible.’ In their first conversation, the young mother tells the hit man that she would prefer the deed to be done outside their West Forest Avenue home, explaining with a laugh that a shooting indoors 'would be messy in the house.' When Merfeld meets up with the detective the following day, carrying a floor plan of their home and directions to the house drawn on lined notebooks sheets, as well as her husband’s' photo, the two decide that the best option is to have Mr Merfeld killed inside the apartment  while she is at work. To make it look like a home invasion gone wrong, the killer will steal items such as a computer. Merfeld also could be seen handing the detective $100 as a down payment to prove to him that she is serious about the hit. At no point during her two encounters with the fake assassin does the 21-year-old wife complain about her husband or cite a specific reason for her decision to have him killed beyond her desire to collect his life insurance. In the course of the second meeting with the cop, Merfeld briefly appears to have second thoughts about the plan. After the assassin tells her repeatedly that he is going to put two bullets in her husband's 'noggin' and that 'he's gonna dies,' she smiles nervously and tells him ' it makes me sad.' A few minutes later, she adds, as if thinking out loud, ' it's a bad idea for me.' End game: The 21-year-old Muskegon woman was arrested and pleaded guilty to soliciting the murder of her 27-year-old husband . Mercy: Merfeld's husband and the target of her murder plot asked the judge to spare her jail time, but she could face up to a life in prison when sentenced July 30 . But not before long, Ms Merfeld appears to be back on track with her deadly plot after the undercover cop stresses that after today, she won't be able to call off the hit even if she has a change of heart at some point before the date chosen for the killing. Merfled then asks the bogus killer, 'What happens if you get caught?' in response, the man reassures her that he will 'take the hit' and keep her name out of the investigation so long as she pays him or his associates ‘on the outside’ the agreed upon sum of $50,000. The second meeting concludes with the hit man and his client shaking hands and him wishing Merfeld luck. 'Thank you. Good luck to you, too,' she replies with a smile as she exits the car. The 21-year-old wife and mother was arrested a short time later and booked into the Muskegon County Jail. After the murder plot was uncovered, Merfled's husband appealed to the judge to spare his wife any jail time. Instead, Judge William Marietti decided to cap the defendant's minimum sentence to six years. She could face up to life in prison when she is sentenced July 30.","Julia Merfeld, 21, pleaded guilty to soliciting a murder and could face up to life in prison .

The corporation's controller of comedy commissioning Shane Allen said Frankie Boyle is 'not a pariah' He has been axed from Channel 4 and was cut from this year’s Comic Relief schedule for making a string of sick jokes. But the BBC still wants Frankie Boyle to return to its mainstream TV channels, its new comedy boss has revealed. The corporation’s controller of comedy commissioning Shane Allen said the controversial comic is ‘not a pariah’ and may return if the right programme emerges. Despite admitting many viewers see him as an ‘offence machine’, he said Boyle’s comedy was ‘done with intelligence and a purpose’, adding: ‘If you’re worried about offending anyone you won’t make any comedy.’ Mr Allen also revealed he hopes to commission new special episodes of Absolutely Fabulous, saying the door is always open to the 1990s classic as it is ‘in the national fabric.’ Before joining the BBC last year, Mr Allen worked with Boyle on Channel 4 sketch show Tramadol Nights. The show was axed after the 40-year-old Scot joked about the autistic son of glamour model Katie Price. Speaking at a Broadcasting Press Guild event, Mr Allen said: ‘I wouldn’t rule him out. He’s not a pariah. Look back to the 70s. Billy Connolly was an outcast. People were kicking in his gates. He was doing jokes about the crucifixion and stuff. ‘I do think there’s offensive and horrible and nasty comedy. If it’s not done with intelligence and a purpose then I think it’s really wrong. You can’t defend it. But I do think Frankie gives us an alternative view of the world.’ Mr Allen said Twitter and other social media caused an ‘added problem’ when hiring controversial comics, because the BBC cannot control what they say online. But he said: ‘What I think [Boyle] stands for is a libertarian mindset, not a million miles away from [BBC star] Charlie Brooker. His angst and his frustration at the world and at how flawed and imperfect we are is where Frankie’s coming from, rather than it dissipating into a nasty diatribe about horrific stuff. Show was axed after the Scot joked about the autistic son of glamour model Katie Price who married Alex Reid . ‘This has been lost along the way. He is seen as this offence machine. This guy who does this horrific offensive comedy.’ He added: ‘Nobody has at yet brought forward an actual project [for Boyle]. I’m trying to find the right thing for the right people. I don’t know what Frankie would go in. I need someone to come in with a vision.’ Asked whether the BBC should be more careful than other broadcasters not to cause offence, Mr Allen said: ‘Offense is subjective. If there’s a purpose or there’s some satirical intent and it’s defendable for humour reasons, then of course you’re going to offend some people. 'Some people get offended by weird things…animal scenes generate the most amount of anger. ‘I think when people are offended they are genuinely offended. But it’s just their internal barometer. It’s a subjective thing. 'If you’re worried about offending anyone you won’t make any comedy.’ Boyle last appeared on the BBC in 2009, when he left satirical panel game Mock the Week claiming he was ‘bored’. Earlier this month BBC bosses were forced to axe Boyle from a Comic Relief broadcast .

The moment a firefighter saved a tiny kitten from a burnt out house and helped bring it back to life has been captured on his helmet camera. Cory Kalanick was at a blaze in Fresno, California, when he spotted the lifeless body of the kitten on the floor of the house. Sadly the kitten did not survive the night, but the touching efforts of Mr Kalanick led to a donation of two animal oxygen masks to help with future rescues. Watch the kitten's rescue: . Pet rescue: Cory Kalanick holds an oxygen mask over the kitten's face as he revives it . In the footage of the rescue, the firefighter was seen carrying the limp kitten from the burnt interior of a house and laying it gently on the road, where he fitted a child's oxygen mask over it and gently massaged it back to life. 'I looked down and you can actually see . the cat shining in the spotlight of my flashlight. And I looked back . and that's when I saw the cat and grabbed him,' he told CBS 47. Mr Kalanick, who always wears a camera on his uniform, used a tank of oxygen in his attempts to save the animal. The kitten was laid on a glove to protect it from the hot sidewalk, and water was poured over its body to try to revive it. Mr Kalanick, who has been a firefighter for ten years, said his crew mates teased him a little at first, but added: 'It's a pretty cool thing that we get to help a kitten out.' He put an edited version of the rescue on his YouTube page.

A cluster of towering concrete blocks that loom over London's Elephant and Castle will now join a list of national treasures, as they've been awarded Grade II listed status. Ernö Goldfinger's Metro Central Heights, has been branded 'soulless' and one of the 'worst examples of post-war development'. But that has not stopped Heritage Minister Ed Vaizey giving the building the prestigious award. Once branded 'soulless', the building has now been given special status because of its high caliibre design . The influential architect, who was renowned for his 'austere' projects, angered James Bond author Ian Fleming so much with his designs that the novelist named one of his most famous villains after him. Fleming had been among the many unhappy objectors to the pre-war demolition of some Hampstead cottages which were removed to make way for Goldfinger's house in Willow Road. Erno Goldfinger considered the Metro Central Heights one of his most significant achievements . The Budapest-born architect threatened to sue who Goldfinger was published in 1959, which prompted Fleming to threaten to rename the character 'Goldprick', but eventually he climbed down and dropped his threat. Built between 1959 and 1967 and  originally called Alexander Fleming House, the south London block housed the Department of Health and Social Security until 1989. But the office block became known as sick building syndrome - where inhabitants suffer health problems linked to spending time inside it - and staff were moved out in the early 1990s to a new headquarters across the road. It remained empty and was considered for demolition, but it was converted to residential use in 2002. The Design Museum said: 'His monumental 1959-1963 scheme for Elephant & Castle in south London is frequently cited as one of the worst examples of soulless post-war developments.' But this hasn't stopped English Heritage advising that the structure should not enjoy protected status. Ed Vaizey said: Goldfinger considered this to be his most significant work. 'Acclaimed when it was first built, it subsequently divided opinion but has now – 25 years after first being put forward for listing – clearly passed the test of time. 'I am pleased now to be able to give it the recognition it deserves. Villain Auric Goldfinger was named after the architect, who incurred the wrath of Ian Fleming with his austere designs . Simon Thurley, Chief Executive of . English Heritage said: 'Built by distinguished architect Ernö . Goldfinger, Metro Central Heights is an excellent example of high . calibre post-war architecture. 'An accomplished building, it has proved highly influential for designs which followed. Trellick Tower took years for Londoners - and especially those living there - to warm to it . 'We are pleased that the Heritage Minister agrees with our advice and has listed it at Grade II. Grade II buildings are nationally important and of special interest; 92 per cent of all listed buildings are in this class and it is the most likely grade of listing for a home owner. However there is some hope for those who view the block as a blot, rather than a treasure - listing does not protect the building. Instead, it means that listed building consent must be applied for in order to make any changes to that building which might affect its special interest. Listed buildings can be altered, extended and sometimes even demolished within government planning guidance. An influential figure in the British modern movement, Goldfinger studied architecture in Paris, the Design Museum said. But his works would often divide residents and critics' opinions. He moved to London in 1934, attracting praise for some projects, notably his Hampstead home, but drawing controversy for ambitious schemes at Elephant and Castle and Poplar. The Trellick Tower in west London, is a prime example of his provoking work. Popular though Trellick is today, it took years for Londoners – and especially those living there – to warm to it, and other Goldfinger projects proved equally contentious.","Ernö Goldfinger's Metro Central Heights, has been branded 'soulless'

A whistleblower sacked as he tried to publicise the success of a new cancer wonder drug has been awarded £3.4million for unfair dismissal. David Best, 63, was chairman and managing director of a medical research company which developed a vaccine against prostate cancer, which in trials produced good results. But Mr Best claimed the company, Medical Marketing International, fraudulently withheld the breakthrough in a bid to artificially depress the company's share price. David Best refused to agree a settlement with the firm which was founded in 1988 by his wife Margaret, 57 . He said when he attempted go public with the discovery and expose the conspiracy he was sacked in 2008 for gross misconduct - and gagged for five years. Mr Best refused to agree a settlement with the firm which was founded in 1988 by his wife Margaret, 57. Instead, he continued to fight with Cambridge-based MMI - which also produced a new AIDS drug - until it was forced into liquidation in 2010. When he refused a payment of £31,000 from the liquidators he was cut out of his share of the company, which he claims ran to hundreds of millions. He then launched a claim for unfair dismissal and an employment tribunal sitting in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire has now found in his favour. Best claimed Medical Marketing International (MMI) fraudulently withheld the breakthrough in a bid to depress artificially the company's share price . Mr Best, who was earning more than £1 million a year as a former director, has now been awarded a payout of £3.4million. Panel judge Michael Ord said: 'The sole reason for the claimant's dismissal was his actions in seeking to expose what he, in good faith, believed to be fraud and unlawful activities by his fellow directors and others. 'The response of the company throughout was to ignore or deny any problem, ignore the claimant's complaints and instead seek to find a reason to remove the claimant from the company.' He added: 'His dismissal, wrongly as being on the grounds of gross misconduct, has caused substantial reputational damage in the pharmaceutical and biomedical world.' Mr and Mrs Best, from Saffron Walden, Essex, developed MMI through several subsidiaries which worked on new drugs and treatments. They worked together on the company for two decades until Mr Best was sacked. Ian Carr, of accountants Grant Thornton, was appointed joint administrator as MMI went into liquidation. Best, who was earning more than £1 million a year as a former director, has now been awarded a payout of £3.4million . He said the liquidators had rejected Mr Best's total claim of more than £800,000 and offered to pay him just over £31,000 in May 2010. When Mr Best failed to appeal this decision he was left out of the share-out from what remained of the company. Mr Carr said it was as a result of MMI being unable to settle Mr Best's original claim that the company went into administration. Mr Best said: 'This court decision is a milestone. 'It now opens up the door to achieve compensation for all who have suffered. 'Obviously this has been a terrible time for me and my immediate family. 'The judge called it ""life-changing"", but I will not be satisfied until all those who have lost out are fairly compensated. 'Margaret and I owned about a third of the business, so we have lost around £130 million.' MMI was never shown to have made a profit although in 2005 it was valued at £175m.","David Best was chairman and MD of Medical Marketing International .

A man who stabbed his estranged wife in the head because she was given custody of their dogs following their split has walked free from court. After attacking Sarah Dowse in the street with a pocket knife as she walked the terriers near her home in Redcar, Martin Clarkson, 59, was heard to say: 'I've given her face a good kicking... she'll need plastic surgery.' Police initially treated the incident as attempted murder, but Clarkson was given a 15-month suspended sentence after admitting inflicting grievous bodily harm. Ms Dowse, 34, last night told of her shock that her former husband was not jailed for the incident on January 24, which saw Clarkson repeatedly stab his ex in the head and fracture her cheekbone before he was overpowered by a passerby. Teesside Crown Court heard he fled to the home of another former wife following the attack and asked: 'Have the police been?', before describing how he had given Ms Dowse's face 'a good kicking'. Passing sentence, Judge Peter Moorhouse imposed a five-year restraining order preventing Clarkson from contacting his ex, but Ms Dowse has since said the ban 'won't stop me feeling in fear of him every day'. 'I expected him to get a prison sentence, and I feel what he received was inadequate for the suffering he caused me,' she said. Prosecutor Tamara Pawson told Teesside Crown Court the couple had been together for eight years and married for two. The relationship broke down late last year and by the time of the incident, Clarkson was said by his barrister to have been at 'an all-time low'. Ms Dowse was walking the Patterdale terrier and border terrier when Clarkson shouted from across the road: 'Can I talk to you?' She replied 'no'. 'Inadequate': Judge Peter Moorhouse gave Clarkson a 15-month suspended sentence . He then ran at his former wife with an open pocket knife in his hand, threatening to stab her, Ms Pawson told the court. Clarkson sliced through one dog lead and then began 'sawing' at the neck of Ms Dowse’s jacket and repeatedly stabbing her head, the court heard. Peter Makepeace, mitigating, told the court the estranged couple's disagreement over their dogs had caused his client to 'snap'. 'Huge difficulties arose about the dogs, who would have custody of them,' he said. 'That is what made Mr Clarkson snap this day. He has never been in trouble before in 60 years and it is explicable by extremely heightened emotions involved in relationship breakdowns. 'He is deeply ashamed of what he has done... he understands it is in everyone’s interests he is kept apart from Sarah Dowse.' Imposing a restraining order and supervision to include alcohol treatment, Judge George Moorhouse told Clarkson: 'It is a very sad day when someone of your age with no previous convictions comes before the court for the first time.'Ms Dowse said last night: “No-one deserves to suffer domestic violence and I would urge anyone who is to get help, there is help out there. 'When I was told what he had received by my barrister, I was devastated. He was given a restraining order but that won’t stop me feeling in fear of him every day.' Peter Cuthbertson from the Centre for Crime Prevention said: 'This is an appalling example of the overuse of suspended sentences when prison would be more appropriate.' The Centre for Crime Prevention is calling on the government to limit suspended sentences to instances involving minor, first-time offenders. 'They should not be used for hardened criminals and crazed stabbings,' Mr Cuthbertson said.","Martin Clarkson, 59, attacked Sarah Dowse, 34, in the street in Redcar .

Stephen Fry’s attempt to kill himself last year happened while he was filming a BBC2 documentary in Africa about the mistreatment of gay people, it has emerged. The actor and TV presenter had been in Uganda, a country famous for its intolerance of homosexuality, when he tried to commit suicide with a cocktail of vodka and pills. Mr Fry was saved after being been discovered in his hotel room, a day after the production had completed filming in the country, by its producer and director Fergus O’Brien. Better spirits: Stephen Fry, pictured at the Ormeley Dinner in London last night, recently spoke out about his suicide attempt . The popular performer was then taken . back to England and the making of the two-part documentary, called Out . There, was put on hold until he had recovered from the incident. The programme, which will air later . this year, sees Mr Fry complaining about the senselessness of attacking . gay people ‘who mean them no harm’.

He had said: ‘Now, you may say, how . can anyone who has got it all be so stupid as to want to end it all? That’s the point, there is no “why?” It’s not the right question.

I took a huge number of pills with a large amount of vodka and the . mixture of them made my body convulse so much that I broke four ribs, . but I was still unconscious. ‘Fortunately when the producer I was . filming with at the time came into the hotel room and I was found in a . sort of unconscious state and taken back to England and looked after.’ Fry first disclosed he had . contemplated killing himself 18 years ago. He was said to have come . close to committing suicide in 1995 after abruptly quitting the West End . play Cell Mates, which had suffered critical reviews.

Missing: Terry Dewayne Smith Jr went missing Saturday night while his step-brother was babysitting . Authorities searched for possible human remains on Wednesday at the home of an 11-year-old autistic boy who disappeared over the weekend -  but volunteers pledged to continue hunting for him in the scorching desert. The home in Menifee, southern California was being treated as a crime scene and investigators were trying to determine whether remains were on the property, Mayor Scott Mann said in an email today. Riverside County sheriff's detectives were led to the home shortly after 1am on Wednesday based on evidence indicating there might be a body there, Deputy Albert Martinez told the Riverside Press-Enterprise. Details were not released but the Sheriff's Department suspended its search for Terry Dewayne Smith Jr. 'Our searchers are on standby. We are waiting to see what investigators find on the property,' Martinez  said. Volunteers planned to continue searching the surrounding semi-rural area for the boy who was last seen on Saturday night. 'Until we have absolute confirmation from the sheriff directly, we will continue to do our job, which is to search,' said a posting on a Facebook page where the volunteer search was organized. About 1,000 people, including sheriff's deputies on horseback, emergency workers and volunteers, hunted for him on Tuesday. Authorities were concerned that he wandered away without food, water or his medication in an area 70 miles southeast of Los Angeles where temperatures have topped 100F. The search continues: Crime scene investigators were looking at a property in Menifee, southern California . In danger: Terry, who weighs 76 pounds and is 4'8"", most likely did not take his medicine with him which will cause problems because he is a high-functioning autistic . The 4-foot-8 boy with sandy brown hair and brown eyes was last seen wearing blue basketball shorts. Local children were asked to not wear blue, to help avoid confusion. Terry was last seen when he followed his 16-year-old step-brother, who told the boy to go home, the Desert Sun reported. The boy's mother said she didn't realize he was missing until 10.30am the next day as she was out for the evening. Terry's mother shared details of the boy's habits on the searchers' Facebook page. Without his medication, Terry may be 'over sensitive and may be walking on his tiptoes', the page said. Searchers were also instructed to call him by his nickname 'Juju' because hearing his full name called out might cause him to believe he's in trouble and flee. Neither Terry's mother nor his . 16-year-old step brother have spoke out publicly, nor have the police . said why the teenager did not notice that his brother was missing . sooner. Investigators took . quick action sending out the first search party on Sunday morning . shortly after the boy's mother called to report him missing. Sticking together: Hundreds of locals volunteered in Meniffe, California to try to raise awareness . High and low: Police searched on horseback and used bloodhounds to see if he was hiding in the nearby hills . The boy's father lives outside of California and has been ruled out as a suspect. Police sent out hundreds of searching volunteers as well as police mounted on horseback and in helicopters. 'We too have a special needs child and we know how sometimes that they wander off and our hearts are breaking,' said volunteer Danielle Adamson. Family friend Sophia Masih warned that if anyone spots Terry, who goes by the nickname Juju, they should approach him cautiously and try to initiate a conversation so that he begins to trust them. 'He acts and looks like he's seven,' she told The Press-Enterprise. 'Because he hasn't taken any of his medication his personality could be very angry, (so) no sudden movements or anything like that.'

Not cooperative: Daisha Inman, seen here in a 2012 booking photo, refused to accept court papers from a process server . The mother of twin 15-year-old heirs to the Doris Duke fortune has been accused of using hired bodyguards and a 'SWAT team' to stop a bank from serving her with legal papers that demand she account for how she is spending their trust fund. This is just the latest duel between JP Morgan, the administrator of the $29million trust fund left by the tobacco heiress, and Daisha Inman - the mother of Georgia and Walker Inman. JP Morgan is holding the fortune in trust until the 15-year-old twins turn 21. The bank has for years battled with Daisha, claiming she is trying to 'drain' the trust fund with lavish spending - including $50,000 for Christmas gifts and $16million for a sprawling Utah estate. According to court documents filed on June 20, process server Nik Coffen went to Inman's home in Park City, Utah, and attempted to serve her with legal papers on May 9, DNAinfo.com reports. Georgia Noel Lahi Inman and Walker . Patterson Inman III are the great-step-niece and nephew of heiress Doris Duke, once described as 'the richest girl in the world.' Their father, Walker Inman Jr, who . died in 2010 of a drug overdose, married Daisha, a former topless . dancer, as his fourth wife. The documentsthat JP Morgan sent were meant to legally notify Daisha that the bank was asking a Manhattan court to force Daisha to detail how she was spending the regular payment she was receiving from the twins' trust fund. The payments are meant to pay for the care and education of the teenagers. At the Utah home, twin heirs answered the door and said their mother had left for several days with a 'friend.' They gave the process server Daisha's called phone number. The broke millionaires: Walker Inman III and twin sister Georgia Inman, 15, have trust funds worth an estimated $60million - but they can't access the money until they turn 21 . Glamorous: Doris Duke, a New York socialite who died in 1993, was known as the 'richest girl in the world' for her trust funds left to her by her father, who founded American Tobacco . After two days of 'phone tag' Coffen . got in touch with Diasha, who reportedly told the process server that . she would not receive the court papers. 'She . told me that she would not be served and that her SWAT team and body . guards would not let me anywhere near her,' Coffen wrote in a affidavit . filed with the court after he tired and failed to deliver the documents . for five days. Finally, on May 14, Coffen went to the Inmans' Utah home again. This time he was blocked by a security guard. After . Daisha refused to be served, with the papers, the court hearing went . ahead as planned in Manhattan on June 28. She was not present. In April, JPMorgan . filed court documents alleging that Randy Williams, 49, a convicted sex . offender who is dating Daisha Inman, has been working with her to drain . money from the trust fund. The . bank accused Williams of using Daish'a email to ask for cash from the . trust fund. He may also be behind unusual requests for money to pay for . gold coins and a vacation to Las Vegas. But . in court filings, JP Morgan says Mrs Inman has become 'erratic and . hostile' and is making increasingly 'suspicious' requests to withdraw . money from the fund, according to DNAInfo.com. 'Danger': The trust fund manager raised concerns about the twin's mother rekindling her relationship with Randy Williams, who has been accused of sexually abusing children . They say Inman, 54, has gotten back together with Williams, her ex-husband, despite his convictions for sexually abusing minors. Williams has been convicted of . molesting his step-daughters from a previous marriage and was barred . from seeing his son after a court in Washington state found that he had . sexually abused and neglected the child, according to Manhattan court . filings by the JPMorgan administrator. 'At the most basic level, (JPMorgan) is concerned about the potential risks to the children,' the trust . administrator wrote, according to the New York Post. Diasha and Williams agreed to split . the 3percent commission that Williams would earn as the real estate . broker for the sale, according to court documents. As a result, the trust fund overseers went so far as to withhold the children's Christmas money. 'Concerned about Randy Williams' proximity to the children, his potential involvement in the children's . financial affairs, and petitioner's continued difficulties with Ms. Inman - including Ms. Inman's failure to account for funds advanced to . her - we determined in December 2012 that it would not transfer . significant funds that had been approved for housing and holiday . expenses to Ms. Inman's own bank account as it had done in the past,' the administrator wrote. Squabbles: The children's mother Daisha (left) was the fourth wife of Walker 'Skipper' Inman Jr (right), who died in 2010 of a methadone overdose . Family tree: Walker and Georgia Inman are the great-niece and nephew of Doris Duke . 'Daddy Warbucks': All of the money in the Duke and Inman fortunes came from the millions James 'Buck' Duke, the founder of American Tobacco . Instead, the bank set up separate funds that the children could access. The administrator claims Williams selected the the $4.3million South Carolina mansion that . Daisha asked the administrator to purchase. He chose the home, because . 'it was described in local media as the most expensive home on the Isle . of Palm,' according to documents. It was revealed last month that . Daisha tried to buy a $29million mansion in Park City, Utah, with the . trust fund - which would have depleted nearly half of her children's . money. 'Instead of locating a suitable . rental property as she had represented she would do, Ms. Inman requested . funding to buy a ranch in Utah with a listing price of $29million . (representing almost the entirety of the property held in the children’s . trusts,' Francis Simms, a JPMorgan executor for the fund, wrote in a . new court filing. The 214-acre ranch boasted eight bedrooms, nine bathrooms, a tennis court, a movie theater and other luxury amenities. 'Shortly before she moved to Utah, . Ms Inman made another premature request to fund the purchase of a . relatively more modest $4.3million South Carolina residence, only to . leave South Carolina without warning a few months later,' Simms wrote. Inman blames JPMorgan for her . family's financial difficulties, claiming their reluctance to repay . legitimate expenses has resulted in the children being suspended from . their private school. She has not commented on the latest claims about . the Utah ranch. Glamor: Doris Duke lived her entire adult life as the subject of news and gossip pages. Her wealth, philanthropy and multiple marriages made her one of the most famous women of her day . Socialite: Duke, seen here with Andy Warhol at Studio 54 in 1977, rubbed elbows with all of New York's most famous people until her death in 1993 . Simms said the tuition wasn't paid . because Inman failed to provide an itemized invoice verifying that the . amount she asked for in tuition in fees was actually the amount that . was owed, according to the New York Post. Ms Inman said she wanted to give her . children a horse, a snowmobile and an around-the-world trip. The trust . paid out $5,000 for Christmas instead. 'If the trustees simply funded all . requests it received, the children’s trusts could be drained of assets . long before the children ever reach the age of 21 years,' JPMorgan . wrote. But Ms Inman says the says the trustees have gone too far and neglected to pay her children's legitimate expenses. The trustees have asked the court to intervene in the battle over twins' money. Home: Doris Duke moved bounced around several lavish homes, including this mansion in Honolulu, Hawaii. She also owned a 2,700-acre farm in New Jersey and a mansion on East 78th Street in Manhattan . Much like her descendants, Duke was unlucky in love. She is pictured here in 1935 with financier James Cromwell, the first of her two husbands . Walker and Georgia's father Walker 'Skipper' Inman Jr, died in 2010 of a methadone overdose. Walker Jr's father was the half-brother of Doris Duke. Doris Duke inherited untold millions . from her father James 'Buck' Duke - the founder of American Tobacco, . maker of Lucky Strike cigarettes. His massive gift to a small, private . college in North Carolina led leaders there to change its name to Duke . University. The huge sum resulted in Duke becoming one of the most elite . universities in the country . Doris Duke, who died in 1993, left a . large philanthropic legacy, as well. She was know during her time as . 'the richest girl in the world' and was a superstar celebrity and . socialite for most of her life. On her death, she left nearly all of . her $1billon estate to the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, which . remains a major force in the philanthropic world. However, Doris Duke had no surviving . biological children and part of the Duke fortune went into trust funds . for the Inman twins.

A Texas teenager was three times over the legal alcohol limit and speeding when he slammed into four people on a roadside, killing them, and injuring 12 others, police say. Ethan Couch, 16, of Keller, and seven friends had been drinking for hours before the June 15 wreck and some of them were even caught on surveillance video stealing two cases of beer from a nearby Walmart. At around 11:45 p.m., the intoxicated teens piled into a red Ford F350 pick-up and were barelling down Burleson-Retta Road in southern Tarrant County when Couch left the road and clipped a broken down SUV, throwing the owner and four good Samaritans, who were trying to help, 60 yards in the air. They were killed on impact. At a press conference on Tuesday, Tarrant County Sheriff Dee Anderson revealed that Couch's blood-alcohol level was 0.24 - three times the limit - and that his truck was traveling up to 70 mph when it started the chain reaction of crashes. Victims: Brian Jennings, 41, pictured right, and Breanna Mitchell, left, were both killed in the horrific crash . '(The driver) was extremely intoxicated, obviously,' Anderson said, according to The Star Telegram, adding that the 16-year-old is the focus of the vehicular manslaughter investigation and will probably be the only one charged, though he hasn't been yet. 'It is a something that was completely preventable. Something that, because a group of people made some very, very bad decisions, four totally innocent people lost their lives. There is just no other way to say it.' Anderson said the teens stole two cases of beer from a Walmart in Burleson about an hour before the crash and prior to that, they tried, unsuccessfully, to buy alcohol at a convenience store. The group had only traveled two blocks when their speeding vehicle came off the road and clipped the SUV belonging to Breanna Mitchell, 24, and plowed into Mitchell, Brian Jennings, 41, Hollie Boyles, 52, and her daughter, Shelby Boyles, 21. Jennings, a Burleson youth minister, had stopped to help Mitchell, whose vehicle had a flat tire, and Boyles and her daughter had come out of their nearby house to assist. The SUV and all four victims were standing off the roadway. They were thrown 60 yards by the force of the speeding vehicle, investigators found. Scene: 911 callers described cars everywhere and kids' lying in ditches' after the June 15 smash . Injured: Two young men, Soliman Mohmand, right, and Sergio Molina, left, who were in Couch's truck were injured. One remains in critical condition . The red pick-up then struck Jennings' parked Silverado pickup, where two boys were inside, waiting for him. The boys were among those injured. The impact sent Couch's pickup flying and it crashed into a tree. None of the drunken teens in the truck were wearing seat belts and two ended up in the tray of the vehicle, Anderson said, according to the Telegram. Soliman Mohmand and Sergio Molina were seriously injured and one remains in critical condition. The Silverado was pushed into a Volkswagen Beetle, which was being driven by Ashlyn Evans, 18. She and her 14-year-old passenger were also injured. The Telegram reported that 911 callers described mangled vehicles and kids 'lying in ditches.' Tragic: Jennings, pictured second from left, was a father of three and a youth minister in Burleson . Crash: One of four vehicles involved in the crash was send flying into a tree . 'I truly believe this is probably the most difficult accident scene we've ever had to work, for a lot of reasons,' Anderson said. 'It was a tremendously trying job for the people who showed up to have four people killed instantly at the scene. 'Almost immediately upon it happening, some family members of the victims came upon the scene. You can imagine how traumatic it was for (them).' Couch has yet to be charged and Tarrant County District Attorney refused to speculate on possible charges. The sheriff said, however, he expects the driver will be charged in juvenile court and added 'I'm confident the case is strong.' Last month, WFAA revealed the June 15 wreck wasn't the first time underage drinking had got Couch in trouble. On February 19, police in the Town of Lakeside, northwest of Fort Worth, found Couch with a 12-ounce can of beer and a 1.75-liter bottle of vodka in the early hours and gave him two citations - one for being a minor in possession of alcohol, the other for consuming alcohol as a minor.","Ethan Couch, 16, from Keller, Texas, and seven friends had been drinking for hours before the June 15 wreck .

In a jury-waived trial, Norfolk County, Massachusetts Judge Robert C. Cosgrove found that Li Rong Zhang lacked criminal responsibility for son Brandon Yang’s 2011 death. Authorities say the 42-year-old Quincy, Massachusetts woman intended to kill herself and her son. Not guilty: Li Rong Zhang was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the 2011 hibachi grill death of her 8-year-old son .

Investigators into the boy’s death found that Zhang had placed a large bureau in front of a bedroom door where Brandon was found dead, face-down on a bed January 13, 2011. It was Zhang’s other son, then 16-year-old Deming Yang, who first spotted trouble and called authorities. He told police he arrived home from school that day to find all the doors to his house locked. When he got inside, he smelled smoke. He was unable to get inside his mother’s room. Firefighters arrived and broke open the door, finding Zhang on the floor of the room, as well. They also found a grill, lighter, and charcoal briquettes.

A Virginia church has been inundated with responses after it posted a message on its Facebook page asking for a family to adopt an unborn baby with Down syndrome that would otherwise be aborted. The Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Gainesville posted the appeal first thing Monday after its lead pastor Reverend Thomas Vander Woude begged the young mother - who is just shy of six months pregnant - and her partner to let him find an appropriate adoptive family. When they agreed, he took to social media and was shocked when he received more than 900 responses in a day from families willing to adopt the child and raise it as their own. The parents are now interviewing three of those families with an adoption agency. Strange appeal: The Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Gainesville posted a message, pictured, on its Facebook page asking for a family to adopt an unborn baby with Downs syndrome . 'When we got in and opened up around 9:30, it was nearly nonstop. All day long, we were receiving phone calls from people who wanted to adopt the baby,' church staff member Martha Drennan told The Washington Times. 'Father Vander Woude has gotten over 900 emails in regard to the baby.' The note, posted by a volunteer who handles the church's social media pages on behalf of Vander Woude, stated: 'There is a couple in another state who have contacted an adoption agency looking for a family to adopt their Downs Syndrome unborn baby. If a couple has not been found by today they plan to abort the baby. 'If you are interested in adopting . this baby please contact Fr.

'Brute': Jeremy Brent Cramer, 38, of Lacey, Wash., is accused of deliberate homicide after his 3-year-old son's body was found in Montana . A Washington state father has been charged with murdering his 3-year-old son after he was arrested Monday while washing blood off his clothes in a convenience-store restroom in Montana. Jeremy Brent Cramer, 38, of Lacey, has been charged with deliberate homicide, Anaconda-Deer Lodge County Attorney Ben Krakowka said. He made an initial court appearance Tuesday, where he asked to be represented by a public defender. His bond was set at $250,000. The boy’s mother, Natalie Cramer, told police Monday that her husband had taken their son, Brody, from their home in Lacey, Thurston County, and was not returning cell phone calls or messages, the Lacey Police Department said in a statement. Police requested help from law enforcement in Eastern Washington, Idaho and Montana in a search for the boy after Mrs Cramer reported her husband’s fuel card was used in Moses Lake. A convenience-store clerk in the Anaconda area  - more than 600 miles from the Cramers' home - called police at around 10.30pm Monday after spotting a man washing blood off his body and clothes in the restroom. Investigators later found the suspect’s vehicle in a rural area about 5 miles southeast of Anaconda. Innocent toddler: Brody Cramer, 3, was found murdered not far from his father's truck . Crime scene: Cramer's car was discovered 5 miles southeast of town on Montana Secondary Highway 569 . Resting place: Officers discovered the boy's body in this field outside of town . An initial search turned up no sign of Brody Cramer Monday night, but his body was found after the search resumed at daybreak. Officials declined to provide more details about where the boy was found or how he may have died. Lacey Police Cmdr. Jim Mack said an Amber Alert wasn’t issued because the mother never indicated that the child was in danger. ‘My officers had no reason to believe that the father was going to harm the child,’ Mack said. ‘It’s a tragedy for the community.’ He said that Cramer had lived in Lacey only about a year and had a Montana driver’s license. He said police had never been called out to the home previously. Mack said that the couple had been arguing about finances recently since Cramer has been unemployed for about a year. ‘He had asked her earlier within the last couple of weeks if they could do a road trip to the East Coast, and she said, “No, we don’t have the money, ”’ Mack said. ‘It sounded like he wanted to go to the East Coast.’ New beginning: The Cramers moved into this home in Lacey, Washington, just over a year ago, but the couple have been fighting over money because Jeremy Cramer had lost his job . Family and friends said that Cramer and his toddler son were best friends, often going on fishing and camping trips together, so it did not initially cause an alarm when the father decided to take little Brody out for a ride at around 9am Monday. At around noon, Natalie Cramer dialled 911, saying that she had called her husband more than 50 times, but he did not answer and did not respond to any of her text messages, the station KIRO-TV reported. Mrs Cramer checked the couple's bank account and discovered that her husband had filled up his truck at a Moses Lake gas station - more than 200 miles away from home. Local police issued a bulletin to look for Cramer's truck and perform a welfare check on the father and son, but no Amber Alert was issued because Cmdr. Mack said they had no indication that Brody Cramer was in danger. At around 10.30pm Monday, police in Anaconda-Deer Lodge got a call from a convenience store clerk reporting that he saw a man trying to wash blood off his hands and clothes in the restroom. In custody: Cramer (center) has been charged with deliberate homicide, which could land him in prison for up to 100 years, if convicted . Crocodile tears: Cramer appeared distraught during his initial court appearance, weeping and grimacing while the charges against him were read . Responding officers quickly collared the 38-year-old suspect, who had no pants on at the time. Police instructed Cramer to get dressed, but the man disregarded the order and was initially arrested on suspicion of disorderly conduct, The Montana Standard reported. Cramer’s car was discovered 5 miles southeast of town on Montana Secondary Highway 569. Little Brody was nowhere to be found. At daybreak, officers began combing through the surrounding area, and at 6am Tuesday they came across his body in a field no far from his father's truck. Natalie Cramer learned of the tragedy a short time later, the news leaving her in a state of disbelief that her husband would be capable of harming their son. On Tuesday, Mr Cramer was led into the Anaconda-Deer Lodge courthouse handcuffed and dressed in jail garb. The man appeared distraught during the proceedings, frequently grimacing and fidgeting as the charges against him were being read aloud. Cramer is due back in court July 30. If convicted of deliberate homicide, he could face up to 100 years in prison.","Jeremy Cramer, 38, charged with deliberate homicide in the murder of his toddler son, Brody .

The New York Times sparked outrage on Twitter yesterday after wrongly calling Andy Murray an 'English' tennis player. After the Scottish star made history by becoming the first British man to win Wimbledon since 1936, the newspaper posted an online story headlined: 'After 77 years, Murray and England rule'. The story was also published on Twitter, and the gaffe was quickly seized upon by tennis fans. Blunder: The New York Times write 'England rule' in a Tweet published after the Scottish player had won Wimbledon . Outrage: Twitter users react after the New York Times made the mistake . Correction: The New York Times send out another Tweet, making clear that Murray is British and not English . The proud Scotsman, who grew up in Dunblane, beat Novak Djokovic yesterday in the men's final in straight sets 6-4 7-5 6-4. Minutes after publishing the story, the New York Times corrected it - although their Tweet about Englishman Andy Murray remains online today. The 26-year-old British player was watched in the Royal box on Centre Court yesterday by both Prime Minister David Cameron and Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond. One Twitter user, called Kirk J Torrance wrote that he will be voting for Scottish independence because the mistake is so commonly made overseas. 'oh dear... See this is one of the reasons I'm voting #Yes in #IndyRef - the world believes that England/ Britain is interchangeable,' he wrote. Delight: Andy Murray holds aloft the Wimbledon trophy after defeating Novak Djokovic of Serbia in straight sets . Focus: Andy Murray makes a forehand return during yesterday's Wimbledon final on Centre Court . Another user, called Daniel Lewis, wrote: '99.9% of Americans so thrilled the English won Wimbledon.' In a tongue in cheek remark, Tom Phillips joked: 'Really disappointing mistake from one of the great Canadian newspapers.' Yesterday Alex Salmond was accused of political opportunism after unfurling a Saltire behind David Cameron's head in the wake of Andy Murray's historic Wimbledon victory. The move was politically sensitive because Scotland is planning to hold an independence referendum in autumn 2014. The SNP leader seemed to deliberately raise the flag behind the Prime Minister so it would be in the television shot. Under fire: Alex Salmond unfurls a Saltire behind David Cameron's head in the Royal Box moments after Andy Murray had won Wimbledon . Supporters of the Union also accused him of breaking All England Club rules which state that large banners and flags cannot be used around the courts. But Mr Salmond told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that he had 'no idea' what the seating plans were, and the Wimbledon authorities had not minded his actions 'in the slightest'. 'I think it (is) a rule more observed in the breaking than the observation,' he added. Stressing that the incident happened after the match had finished, Mr Salmond pointed out that, while Britain had waited 77 years, no Scot had won the tournament since Harold Mahoney in 1896. Following: Scottish star Andy Murray is watched by both Prime Minister David Cameron (front) and First Minister Alex Salmond (rear) at Wimbledon . 'It is not something that happens very often so I think a few Saltires hoisted over Wimbledon does not do any harm at all,' he said. 'I had no idea what the seating arrangements were - that is absolutely the case.' He said the flag had been in his wife Moira's handbag. Asked whether Murray's achievement had been a triumph for Britain, he replied: 'Absolutely, and for tennis fans everywhere. Let everyone enjoy the triumph. But you will allow us just the little sneaky thing of the first Scot since 1896. Let us wave our Saltires.'","Newspaper hailed Murray's Wimbledon victory by writing 'England rule'

Authorities have told the parents of the two Chinese schoolgirls killed in the Asiana Airlines crash which of their daughters was the one possibly struck and killed by a fire truck on the runway. The parents of 16-year-old Ye Mengyuan, a talented gymnast, were told by investigators on Tuesday that she was the victim potentially hit by the vehicle, the San Mateo County coroner said. Ye's parents flew to San Francisco International Airport late on Monday night along with the parents of 16-year-old Wang Lin Jia, a close friend of Ye's who was also killed in the crash. Authorities revealed earlier this week that, amid the chaos, it is possible that an emergency responder vehicle hit and killed one of teenagers. Her body was found by an escape slide. Loss: Investigators have told the parents of Ye Mengyuan, left, that she could have been hit by a fire truck after the Asiana plane crash. She died with her schoolfriend Wang Linjia, right .

A newspaper column lampooning Southern Baptists, calling the group 'the crazy old paranoid uncle of evangelical Christians,' is causing quite a stir in a Kentucky city and put a pastor's job in jeopardy. The column was written by Angela Thomas, the wife of Bill Thomas, an assistant pastor at the First Baptist Church in Madisonville. Her column was done in response to the Southern Baptist Convention's opposition to a new Boy Scouts of America policy that welcomes gay members. The First Baptist Church in Madisonville, Kentucky has been caught up in uncertainty over the future of Assistant Pastor Bill Thomas after his wife wrote a column lampooning their church . 'Sexuality doesn't come up and isn't relative to typical scouting activities but now, thanks to Southern Baptists, the parents of little innocent scouts everywhere are having to have The Talk,' she wrote June 19 in The Madisonville Messenger. She writes a weekly humor column for the community paper, which publishes daily. In the weeks since, the status of Bill Thomas' job with the church has become unclear. The First Baptist pastor said he had accepted Thomas' resignation, but Thomas' wrote in a letter obtained by the newspaper he had not quit. Thomas has worked at the church for 10 years and was also its musical director. 'The crazy old paranoid uncle of evangelical Christians': Angela Thomas used her newspaper column to poke fun at Southern Baptists . Bill and Angela Thomas declined to be interviewed by The Associated Press on Tuesday. But he previously told the newspaper he agreed with what his wife wrote. The column said Southern Baptists have become 'raging Shiite Baptists' after drifting 'to the right' for the past four decades. 'Santa and the Easter bunny are simply the devil in disguise and cable television and the Internet are his playground. The Boy Scouts are his evil minions,' she wrote. Madisonville is a city of about 19,000 in the western part of the state, about 115 miles southwest of Louisville. First Baptist Church Pastor Joe Leonard said the opinion piece was not the cause of Bill Thomas' departure. 'That's what people have made it out to be,' Leonard said. 'That column precipitated some conversation with (Thomas), but that is not the reason he resigned. And because of confidentiality I can't divulge the conversation and what went on.' The Southern Baptist Church is strongly opposed to the Boy Scouts of America new policy to welcome openly gay members . Leonard said he had accepted Thomas' resignation and Thomas was not fired. Thomas wrote in a letter he had not resigned and had no intention of stepping down. The Rev. Russell Moore, head of the public policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention, said he was surprised the 'shockingly sarcastic tone' of the column came from the spouse of a church employee. It's not clear whether Angela Thomas also attended First Baptist. 'I didn't find the column to be the sort of lighthearted poking that one would typically find in satire,' Moore said. 'I found it instead to be more of a screed from someone who's very hostile to where most Baptists stand.' Moore said the column also mischaracterized the convention's stance on the Boy Scout policy. The Southern Baptist Convention's action last month 'was a very balanced resolution that didn't denounce the Boy Scouts,' Moore said. 'We expressed disappointment, but didn't speak in harsh terms and also did not direct churches as to how they should respond.' The Southern Baptist Convention believes in marriage between a man and a woman and condemns homosexuality as a sin. The headquarters of the nation's largest protestant denomination - Southern Baptists - in Nashville, Tenn. Many churches around the country, including some Baptist, have protested the Boy Scouts' policy by cutting ties with their local chapters. First Baptist member Larry Wilson said Bill Thomas was accused of 'intolerable insubordination' by a staff committee and was told to submit a letter of resignation. 'To me, it sounds more like a termination or a forced resignation than a resignation,' said Wilson, who is also a Hopkins County magistrate. Wilson said he believed Bill Thomas ran afoul of some church leadership before the column was published by supporting an openly gay church member. Wilson said Thomas was told to prevent the member from joining the choir, but Thomas declined to do so. The church offered Thomas a severance package – contingent on him not making public statements about the details of his departure, Wilson said. According to church policy, staff terminations must be approved by the congregation, and church leaders wanted to avoid that step, Wilson said. Wilson said he enjoyed reading Angela Thomas' column. 'There were points in it that I thought were hilarious, it was funny, thought provoking,' he said. 'Maybe we are Shiite Baptists.'

It's a murder trial involving almost a . half-dozen mistresses, a botched investigation at a troubled police . department and a missing pickup truck at the heart of the case. After a month of testimony, the trial . of former Albuquerque police officer Levi Chavez , accused of killing his wife with . his service weapon, has become a tale of workplace romances and steamy . affairs, including a love triangle at the hair salon where the victim . worked. In all, four mistresses and a woman . who married defendant just after his wife's death have . testified about their trysts with him. Several of the women were police . officers. The case also has threatened to . further tarnish the reputation of the beleaguered Albuquerque Police . Department, which already is under investigation by the U.S. Justice . Department over a series of police shootings. Accused: Prosecutors have depicted Levi Chavez as a philanderer whose marriage was crumbling, and say he killed his wife after she found out he had staged the theft of his pickup truck to collect the insurance proceeds . The less-than-perfect crime: Tera Chavez was killed when her husband allegedly shot her in the mouth and tried to make it look like a suicide . The trial included allegations that officers at the scene removed and even flushed key evidence down the toilet. Chavez, 32, is accused of shooting . his 26-year-old wife, Tera Chavez, with his department-issued gun in . 2007 at their Los Lunas home and then trying to make her death look like . a suicide. Prosecutors have depicted Chavez as a . philanderer whose marriage was crumbling, and say he killed his wife . after she found out that he had staged the theft of his pickup truck . valued at more than $20,000 to collect the insurance proceeds. The defense says the death was a . suicide by a woman unraveling over her failed marriage and . relationships. Chavez's lawyer says he could not have killed his wife in . October 2007 because he was with another woman at the time. Tera Chavez was also having an affair . with an Albuquerque police officer who was married to the maid of honor . in her wedding, witnesses said. They had sex in the back of a hair . salon where she worked, according to testimony. 'This trial is like a mosquito in a . nudist colony,' said Tom Garrity, owner of the Albuquerque-based public . relations firm The Garrity Group. 'Where do you begin?' The case is nearing the end as defense attorney David Serna calls final witnesses this week. Serna, who has long represented . clients in high-profile New Mexico homicide cases, was able to convince . the judge to bar statements Tera Chavez made about her husband and his . 'cop buddies' staging the theft of Levi Chavez's 2004 Ford F-250 truck . as part of an insurance scam. Now Serna is working to show how his client was a victim of a larger effort to paint him as a monster. The OTHER side of the law: Former Albuquerque police officer Levi Chavez seen here in his mugshot after allegedly murdering his wife . 'There has been a persistent anti-Levi Chavez campaign by the media from the beginning,' Serna told The Associated Press. A key to Serna's defense strategy has . been to discredit former Valencia County Sheriff's Detective Aaron . Jones, one of the first investigators on the scene who concluded that . the death 'looked staged.' Serna has portrayed Jones as a . conspiracy theorist unable to hold steady law enforcement jobs in . California and New Mexico as he kept stumbling upon 'nefarious . activities' involving crooked police that were never borne out. Jones was taken off the investigation into Tera Chavez's death after calling his supervisors derogatory names. He was also in the middle of one of . the trial's more colorful moments when he testified that he believed . Chavez was pretending to cry over his wife's death during interviews, . which he saw as a clue Chavez might have been involved. 'If there is no snot, believe him . not,' he testified in a comment that drew immediate comparisons to . attorney Johnnie Cochran's theatrics during the O.J. Simpson trial. But Chavez and his lawyer suffered an . apparent setback last week when a crime scene expert testifying in his . defense failed to pull off a demonstration of how the officer's wife . might have been able to kill herself with his gun. There was a bullet in the gun's . chamber when it was found next to Tera Chavez's body, leading . prosecutors to argue that she could not have shot herself and then . released the magazine. Protect and serve: Levi Chavez, left, sits with his attorney at his murder arraignment in the Valencia County District Court . Larry McCann, the expert, suggested . that Tera Chavez held the gun upside down and used her thumb to pull the . trigger. But McCann tried a few times to show jurors that he could pull . the trigger and press the gun's magazine release in one continuous . motion, but it didn't work. 'I can't get it to work today,' he said. The failed demonstration drew gasps, smiles and whispers from members of Tera Chavez's family. The investigation also has been . criticized since an Albuquerque officer, on scene to help Levi Chavez . cope with his wife's death, cut out a piece of a bloody mattress and had . the piece destroyed. Another officer used a toilet and . flushed it before investigators had a chance to examine what may have . been blood floating inside. In other testimony, a digital . forensic investigator with the Los Lunas Police Department told the jury . that an Internet search from November 2006 on 'how to kill someone' was . found on Levi Chavez's computer.

A police department released footage on Tuesday which reveals the shocking moment that a man was pepper-sprayed in the ear while handcuffed in a squad car. The tape of Eric Hightower's arrest last August was made public after a separate cellphone video from a concerned citizen shows Officer Jesse Zilge viciously beating the suspect as he lay on the sidewalk. The St Paul Police Department camera shows Hightower being dragged into the rear of the car by his hair before Officer Matthew Gorans sprays Mace in his ear. The suspect screams: 'He sprayed my ear!' and begs officers to wipe away the burning sensation from his eyes and ear. Scroll down for videos .

Howls: Hightower rocks about in the rear of the police car in handcuffs and begs police officers to wipe his burning eyes and ear after he was Maced . Pepper spray incapacitates victims for up to 45 minutes with painful and burning sensations from the ingredient oleoresin capsicum, a byproduct of cayenne pepper. It can also cause temporary blindness and swelling. Hightower said the spray caused his eyes to swell and his face was numb. He said he couldn't hear anything out of his right ear. He later used a water fountain to flush out his eyes . at the jail and received ice packs for swelling . on his chest. Jeff Martin, president of the NAACP in St Paul told the Star Tribune that the officers were 'bullies in a badge'. He added: 'I think it’s worse because you have a person that’s totally defenseless.' Zilge and Gorans could face disciplinary action over the new tape, said a St Paul police spokesman. However neither officer faces criminal charges. In August 2012, Zilge was caught on camera phone kicking Hightower once in the . chest and then with . the assistance of another officer, slamming his head onto the . hood of a squad car. Police said that Hightower was a . dangerous suspect who was wanted by authorities for allegedly . threatening to kill his ex-girlfriend which is the reason he was pulled over. Zilge was placed on leave at the time and was subject of an . internal investigation. A passer-by begins filming right after Mr. Hightower was brought to the ground by Officer Zilge . Hightower said last year that he and his friends were on their way to . a park when an officer jumped out of a squad car and ordered everyone . onto the ground. The officer singled out Hightower and began spraying . him with a chemical. Hightower said he never resists arrest, but . said: 'Why would I get down on the ground when you still haven't told me . what was I under arrest for? 'I don't feel like I was obligated to get . down on the ground just because you said so.' Protests: Officer Zilge stands over Mr Hightower who screams out that the officer has no reason to have apprehended him let alone attempt to arrest him . Officer Zilge then strikes Mr Hightower with a kick as he lies on the ground . While on the ground, . Hightower said he continued to ask the officer what he did wrong, but . the officer wouldn't say. Hightower said the officer pointed his Taser . at him, but didn't use it. He said the officer became agitated. 'He . sprayed me in my face again. I was laying on my side, I was hocking up . the stuff, it was choking me and he ran towards me, kicked me in the . chest, kicked me in the chin,' Hightower said. Eric Hightower said he didn't know why he was being arrested, nor why was he kicked when St Paul police officers pulled him over last August . A . brief report filed by Zilge lists hands, fists and feet among the . weapons used by police in the arrest, but does not describe the events . shown in the video that was recorded by a citizen.

"By . Peter Allen In Paris . PUBLISHED: . 04:41 EST, 9 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:02 EST, 9 July 2013 . French first lady Valerie Trierweiler was today forced to pay legal costs to a writer who accused her of being the ‘shared’ mistress of two married politicians. It follows Ms Trierweiler withdrawing her claim of defamation against Christophe Jakubyszyn, who exposed the 48-year-old’s extraordinarily colourful love life. Mr Jakubyszyn and fellow TV journalist Alix Bouilhaguet wrote a book called ‘La Frondeuse’ (The Troublemaker) which Ms Trierweiler originally wanted pulped. French President Francois Hollande and his partner Valerie Trierweiler. The accusations over her fidelity were made in a biography of the First . Lady called The Troublemaker . It reveals how she was regularly sleeping with 58-year-old Francois Hollande, the future Socialist president, at the same time as former conservative minister Patrick Devedjian, now 68. Ms Trierweiler, who works for the glossy celebrity magazine Paris Match, was still married to fellow journalist Denis Trierweiler while the affairs were taking place in the early 2000s. Both men were aware they were ‘sharing’ Ms Trierweiler, but when Mr Devedjian refused to leave his wife, she stuck with Mr Hollande, says the book. Mr Hollande was still with Segolene Royal, the mother of his four children, at the time of the four year-long affair, the book alleges. Ms Trierweiler has never directly denied the accusations, and has now abandoned her libel claim for £90,000. This is despite the first lady winning a privacy case against the writers, using notoriously strict French legislation designed to protect the personal lives of public figures from public scrutiny. Ms Trierweiler was said to be sleeping with Mr Hollande at the same time as Patrick Devedjian (pictured right) Following the withdrawal of the defamation case, Ms Trierweiler has to pay the equivalent of £2,150 to Mr Jakubyszyn to cover legal expenses, and the same amount to his publishers. Ms Trierweiler’s humiliation was blamed by her barrister, Frederique Giffard, ‘purely on procedure.’ He pointed to the fact that she was awarded the equivalent of more than £10,000 by the Tribunal de Grande Instance in Paris following her successful privacy case earlier this year. But the journalists both insist that their account of Ms Trierweiler’s past was the result of an ‘honest investigation’ meant to illustrate ‘the overbearing closeness between politicians and political journalists’. Despite being a journalist for a magazine which regularly features intimate details of people’s private lives, Ms Trierweiler has become notoriously litigious since moving into the Elysee Palace last year. She successfully sued Paris Match rivals Voici and Closer for publishing swimsuit pictures of her and Mr Hollande on a private beach. Ms Trierweiler has not commented on her latest court reversal, which was announced in an official court order late on Monday. She is herself facing a legal action over claims that the taxpayer should not be supporting her lifestyle as the ‘president’s mistress’. Xavier Kemlin, a supermarket chain heir, launched the complaint earlier this year, saying: ‘It is scandalous that our taxes are being used to house, feed, upkeep and pay for the staff and travel of a lady to whom we have no legal obligation.’","Claims of the affair were made in a book called 'The Troublemaker'

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . PUBLISHED: . 09:15 EST, 10 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:07 EST, 10 July 2013 . A 12-foot-long alligator has been caught in a Central Florida river where a teen was bitten while swimming. Andrew Hudson of Winter Springs estimated it was 10-foot-long alligator that pulled him by the head into a death roll Monday while he swam in the Little Big Econ State Forest. The alligator trapped and killed Tuesday night was bigger than the one Hudson described, but Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission spokeswoman Joy Hill says it's likely the same one. Found: The search is off for an alligator that nearly killed a 17-year-old swimmer in Florida Monday. This 12-foot specimen, caught Tuesday near the location of the attack, is in all likelihood the culprit . 'It is nearly impossible to know for certain whether or not this is the gator that bit the 17-year-old,' Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission spokeswoman, Hill told the Orlando Sentinel. ‘But the fact that it was easily attracted to bait that was set very close to where Hudson was bitten, and that is showed little fear of the trapper, indicates a high probability that it is the alligator we were targeting.’ Usually more timid, this particular alligator’s fearlessness had wildlife authorities worried in the area where swimming and other recreation are common. Though they can’t identify the creature as the one involved in the attack with absolute certainty, Hill said their satisfied enough to call the hunt over. No more alligators will be trapped at the park unless another aggressive alligator is reported. Relief: Andrew Hudson, 17, escaped with 19 and can now rest easy, knowing his foe has been caught and killed . Unexpected: The 17-year-old was attacked in the Little Econlockhatchee River at the Little Big Econ State Park near Geneva, Florida. Swimming is allowed in the river . Professional trapper George Walrath . pulled the huge beast from the Little Econlockhatchee River just a day . after the attack left Hudson bleeding from the head. The teenager escaped with 19 stitches and staples in his head after the terrifying encounter. Hudson said the alligator suddenly attacked as he swam near Geneva, Florida. Paramedics said his quick reaction almost certainly saved his life. 'He had blood from the top of his head all the way down': Hudson underwent 3 hours of stitching and stapling following the attack . 'At . first I didn’t know what it was, so my reaction just started swinging . and took off swimming as fast as I could to get away from it.' With . blood pouring from a wound that stretched from his forehead to the back . of his head, Hudson managed to clamber out of the water. He . wrapped his shorts around his head to stem the bleeding while a friend, . Mark O’Shea, ran close to a mile until he found a park ranger who . called paramedics. Hudson was rushed to South Seminole Hospital where he underwent three hours of surgery on Monday night. '(It) just came from behind and jerked him under,’ O’Shea said. ‘He went . under and started freaking out, and I saw him come halfway up to the . shore.’ O’Shea said Park Rangers were skeptical when he arrived breathless to tell them about the attack. ‘They looked at me like I was crazy. I'm like, “My friend really got bit by an alligator,”’ said O'Shea. Hudson told Florida Wildlife Officials he did not see any alligators when he and his friends first went in the water.

Elisabeth Hasselbeck has confirmed that she will be leaving The View after ten years on the program and got teary-eyed when she said goodbye during her last day on Wednesday. Reports surfaced Tuesday that Hasselbeck, the lone conservative Republican on the talk show, is headed to Fox News' morning talk show and so The View quickly announced that today's show would be the blonde's last appearance as a co-host. Hasselbeck kept her emotions in check as she thanked each of the three co-hosts (the fifth, Sherri Shephard, is off this week) and the women exchanged compliments about one another. Scroll down for video . Quick goodbye: Elisabeth Hasselbeck confirmed that she will be leaving The View after ten years and will now be co-hosting one of the Fox News morning programs . Parting words: Joy Behar couldn't help but take a shot at Elisabeth's conservative views, sarcastically saying that she would surely be a 'fish out of water' at Fox . 'Over the course of a decade I feel like I have attended the Barbara Walters school of broadcasting and journalism,' the 36-year-old said as she turned to her mentor. 'I feel like I have my masters from being next to you.' Hasselbeck and Walters were the two who got the most emotional during the goodbye on Wednesday's show, as Whoopi Goldberg and Joy Behar stayed a bit more stoic. Goldberg and Behar, the two most liberal voices on the daily panel show, both thanked Hasselbeck, with Goldberg calling her 'the cat's meow' and Behar taking a pot-shot at her new employer. 'Gee, Fox- won't you be a fish out of water there?' Behar said to Hasselbeck. Support: Barbara Walters was the most emotional during the opening segment where they talked about Hasselbeck's departure after ten years on the show . Behar and Hasselbeck regularly 'sparred' on the show over their political differences but Behar asserted that they were still good friends who went back to 'talking about shoes' as soon as the discussion was over. Hasselbeck also gave a shout out to Shepherd even though she was missing from the set on Wednesday, saying that she is her 'sister in Christ and I will love you for life'. Hasselbeck joined The View in 2003 after initially achieving some fame from competing in the 2001 series of Survivor. Her time on the talk show has not been entirely smooth sailing: she famously got into an on-air argument with Rosie O'Donnell over the war in Iraq that lead to producers using a split-screen to show the two women verbally attacking one another. Removed: Goldberg and Behar (left and center left) were the least effusive with their praise on Wednesday and did not seem visibly upset about the news of Hasselbeck's departure . Sparring partners: Behar and Hasselbeck were frequently at odds when it came to political discussions as they represent the opposite ends of the spectrum . Cool sign off: Whoopi said that Elisabeth was 'the cat's meow' She also issued a tearful apology to former ESPN host Erin Andrews after she said that the peeping Tom who taped her naked in her hotel room wouldn't have had to do that if he waited for her revealing outfits during her turn on Dancing With The Stars. This morning, Hasselbeck thanked Walters for helping make her 'more than prepared and confident to move forward' with her new position at Fox. The mother-of-three will be taking over for Gretchen Carlson, who is the female co-host on Fox and Friends. Hasselbeck will join Steve Doocy and Brian Kilmeade as Carlson will be anchoring her own daytime show on Fox. Faux tears: In an surprising move, rather than first thank her co-hosts, Hasselbeck praised the efficiency of the workers behind the scenes- from security to the make up teams- who made their jobs easier . Mock anger: Hasselbeck joked that Sherri Shepherd's absence- the fifth co-host is away for the week- would not count as an 'act of protest' to keep her from leaving . 'I have been a long-time fan of Fox & Friends and am excited to be joining their team in September as it is an honor to call the Fox News Channel my new television home,' Hasselbeck said in the Fox News Channel announcement released on Tuesday. Hasselbeck's departure is not the only one shaking up The View. Walters, who created the show with her producing partner Bill Getty in 1997, is retiring next summer and Behar announced in March that this would be her last season on the show. 'We are not going to be filling it very soon,' Walters said of Hasselbeck's seat. May 2007Rosie O'Donnell and Hasselbeck were co-hosts for several months, but an on-air spat between the two led to O'Donnell's departure. The war in Iraq was always a 'hot topic' on the show, and the infamous split screen fight after O'Donnell accused Hasselbeck of refusing to stand up against pundits who twisted her words. Split screen spat: O'Donnell and Hasselbeck got in an argument about what Rosie said about the Iraq War . July 2008 . Elisabeth broke down in tears when the group started talking about whether or not it was ever appropriate to use the n-word. Goldberg and Shepherd- the two African American hosts on the show- said that it was allowed in conversations among black people but not by white people, and Hasselbeck argued that such divisions implied that the two races lived in two different worlds. December 2008She sparred with lesbian singer Melissa Etheridge over Proposition 8, saying that gay marriage should not be settled by 'activist judges' but rather come from the people. May 2010 Former ESPN anchor Erin Andrews went on Dancing With The Stars a year after a peeping Tom was arrested for filming her naked in a hotel room and stalking her. When The View hosts were talking about the reality dance competition, Hasselbeck took a jab at Andrews' revealing outfits, saying that if the man had waited he would have saved himself jail time. The next day she issued a tearful apology to Andrews saying she did not mean to belittle the crime. November 2011Bill Maher said on his show that since CBS journalist Lara Logan returned from Egypt after being sexually assaulted, America should send Elisabeth in her place. The comedian was a guest on The View and she took the chance to berate him over the incident.","Elisabeth Hasselbeck is leaving The View after ten years as a co-host .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 09:57 EST, 10 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:11 EST, 10 July 2013 . Sen. Claire McCaskill (pictured) said the Pentagon will take a 'second look' at how it accounts for MIA soldiers . The Pentagon is set to take a 'second look' at how it goes about accounting for missing Americans on foreign battlefields, as they try to account for tens of thousands of MIA soldiers from previous wars . The U.S. estimates there are more than 83,000 Americans missing from World War II, Korea and Vietnam. The disclosure of an internal assessment revealed that the current accounting of MIA soldiers is 'acutely dysfunctional' and at risk of failure, The Pentagon said yesterday. 'We have a sacred obligation to perform this mission well,' Pentagon press secretary George Little told reporters, referring to the Joint POW-MIA Accounting Command, or JPAC, which is based in Hawaii and run by a two-star general. Over the past three years, JPAC has reported an average of 69 identifications of recovered remains per year, down from 85 per year over the previous three years. Congress is demanding that it make at least 200 identifications per year starting in 2015, a target it is widely expected to miss. The Associated Press reported on Sunday that a 2012 internal assessment of JPAC's field operations - including the search for and recovery and identification of remains -- found it suffers from ineptitude, waste and mismanagement. JPAC leaders suppressed the study but the AP obtained a copy after it had been denied to others who requested it under the Freedom of Information Act. 'We're going to review the concerns raised in the report to see how JPAC is or isn't functioning well,' Little said. 'And if steps need to be taken to remedy what's happening inside JPAC, then we'll take action. This is an important mission.' The Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, also has examined JPAC. Members of the JPAC, Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command, right, and South Korean Army soldiers search for remains of U.S. soldiers killed during the 1950-53 Korean War in South Korea (pictured in 2009) A Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Col. Jim Gregory, said the Pentagon has responded to the GAO's findings and recommendations and expects the results to be made public shortly. Separately, members of Congress pressed the Pentagon and JPAC for answers. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., wrote to JPAC's commander, Maj. Gen. Kelly K. McKeague, to request a copy of the internal report and other documentation. 'We've got a responsibility to make sure this program is being run in a responsible manner, and I will not rest until we have answers,' McCaskill said. She is chairman of a subcommittee that focuses on government waste and fraud. Little said the Pentagon's review would be undertaken by the office of James Miller, the undersecretary of defense for policy, who oversees JPAC and other aspects of the Pentagon's efforts to resolve the cases of missing service members. He said he could not yet spell out the exact parameters of the review. Asked why Miller acted now, Little said not all of the problems cited in the internal JPAC report had been brought to the attention of senior Pentagon officials until after the AP wrote about them. 'Some of these concerns, quite frankly, didn't bubble up,' Little said. 'And it's important when these concerns are raised to take a look, so I think it's the prudent thing to do.' The issues were not fully aired because the report, which was written by Paul M. Cole, a JPAC employee who studied the organization's inner workings for more than a year, was essentially buried by JPAC commanders. In an internal memo to his staff, the JPAC commander at the time, Maj. Gen. Stephen D. Tom, wrote on Feb. 3, 2012, that his organization would 'not consider any allegations, findings or recommendations from the report,' which he said would 'not be considered in future planning efforts' aimed at improving operations. He 'disavowed' the study and said it was 'rejected in its entirety.' Tom said some parts of the study were 'poorly written, reflect a bias and contain findings and recommendations that go beyond the intended scope of the report.' He demanded that it not be further shared or even copied. Little was asked whether JPAC's handling of the contentious report will be part of Miller's review. 'This review hasn't even been initiated, but it will be started shortly. And I would imagine that those and other questions will be asked as part of it,' he said.",Internal assessment revealed that the current accounting of MIA soldiers is 'acutely dysfunctional' and at risk of failure .

A sex scandal has erupted in Lakeland Police Department after an employee claims she was groped and pressured for sex by up to a dozen officers over eight years and detailed trysts in police and fire stations, patrol cars, motels and even in a parking lot after a memorial service for a slain officer. Sue Eberle, 37, has told officials she had consensual and sometimes coerced sex with the officers and a firefighter and was once propositioned by a city worker in Lakeland. Eberle's accounts of the liaisons were largely corroborated by her sexual partners and others within the police department and published in a graphic, 59-page report written in an incredulous tone by the county's top prosecutor. It said the department's problems investigating crimes might be caused by some high-ranking officers being more interested in having sex with Eberle - married mother-of-two - than doing their jobs. Victim: Sue Eberle, 37, has told officials she had consensual and sometimes coerced sex with the officers and a firefighter and was once propositioned by a city worker in Lakeland . Married mother-of-two: Eberle recounted how she had sex in police cars, cemeteries and motels with different officers and in the parking lot outside a reception that followed the funeral of Officer Arnulfo Crispin . 'The investigation revealed an . extraordinary amount of sexual conduct that was committed both on-duty . and off-duty,' wrote Jerry Hill, Polk County's state attorney, in the . report dated June 25. 'We . find the conduct of a number of sworn officers, including some officers . of rank, to be at best a waste of taxpayer dollars. 'At . worst their actions indicate a moral bankruptcy that exists amongst . some individuals within the ranks at the Lakeland Police Department.' Lakeland police Capt John Thomason, the highest-ranking LPD supervisor, retired after being named in a wide-reaching sex scandal . Eberle, . who has retained an attorney, recounted for Hill how she had sex in . police cars, cemeteries and motels with different officers — and in the . parking lot outside a reception that followed the December 2011 funeral . of Officer Arnulfo Crispin, who had been fatally shot on duty. She . also said officers and some supervisors pressured her for sex, groped . her while working and texted her photos of their genitalia. 'She was a target. She was weak. And . they knew that they could take advantage of that, so they preyed upon . her. They preyed upon her, and that's what's so sick about it,' Eberle's . attorney, David Linesch, said during a recent news conference. Linesch's . spokeswoman said Eberle is not granting interviews at this time. The . Associated Press typically does not identify alleged victims of sexual . assault but Eberle has gone public with her story, appearing alongside . her attorney and husband at a recent news conference about the . allegations. The . mother-of-two, is on paid administrative leave. Three city employees . have resigned, and others - such as the former assistant chief of the . department - have retired. Five other officers have been placed on . either administrative leave or modified duty. The scandal has stunned folks in Lakeland, a city of almost 100,000 people halfway between Tampa and Orlando. 'It's been devastating for the community,' said Ellen Simms, who owns a framing shop in the city's historic downtown. 'The actions of a few are tarnishing the reputation of a good department. It's heartbreaking.' The . Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating, while Hill's . office spent three months interviewing participants and witnesses. In . his report addressed to Lakeland Police Chief Lisa Womack, Hill also . drew parallels between the sex scandal and other 'shortcomings' within . the department, including recent problems with traffic stops, searches . and investigations that have been detailed in The Ledger, Lakeland's . newspaper. Headquarters: Nearly a dozen police officers in Lakeland are under investigation after state and local officials uncovered a widespread sex scandal that has unfolded over eight years . A report addressed to Lakeland Police Chief Lisa Womack, pictured, . drew parallels between the sex scandal and other 'shortcomings' within . the department, including problems with traffic stops, and searches . 'Had these . members of your department been more focused on the important . responsibilities of law enforcement, rather than pursuing sexual . encounters with a civilian analyst, LPD might not be in the condition it . is today,' Hill wrote. Womack wouldn't comment on the report or the scandal - a Lakeland Police spokeswoman said all comments are being made from City Hall. Womack was an outsider who had worked in Illinois and Texas when she became the department's chief in March 2011. 'Our hearts ache for Mrs Sue Eberle and her family, the citizens of Lakeland, and all the families and children who have been affected by this tragedy,' Lakeland Mayor Gow Fields wrote in a statement. Legislative leaders are furious and have asked Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd to help get the department on track. Lakeland Mayor Gow Fields said: 'Our hearts ache for Mrs Sue Eberle and her family, the citizens of Lakeland, and all the families and children who have been affected by this tragedy' 'We find the State Attorney's report . on the behavior of the LPD officials to be shocking, revolting and a . clear cause for action,' wrote Rep Seth McKeel, R-Lakeland. 'A . culture which, at best lacks professionalism and at worst encourages . the reckless behavior of LDP officials, is apparently pervasive and is . an embarrassment to our community. This culture has unfortunately eroded . the public's confidence in the Lakeland Police Department.' Eberle, . through her attorney and in the state attorney's report, said she was . unable to fend off the sexual advances because she has been a victim of . sexual assault in the past. Initially, . she didn't want to speak with investigators - she balked at turning . over her phone with text messages and photos, saying that it would hurt . the officers' families - but later decided to cooperate because she felt . victimized and abandoned by the department. Eberle also confided in a female officer friend, who initially doubted the stories until Eberle showed her some of the text messages and photos she had received from other officers. The friend told Hill that she thought Eberle's desire to please, inability to say no and sexual promiscuity made her a target. While seven officers admitted to having sexual contact with Eberle, three other sergeants denied her claims and refused to take polygraph tests. Hill said he questioned the credibility of those sergeants. The report also said that other employees knew about the encounters and didn't report it to higher-ups. The state attorney said he couldn't prosecute the cases because of a lack of physical evidence and because so much time has passed since some of the sexual encounters. However, Fields said the officers and employees involved are under an internal investigation and will be 'disciplined to the fullest extent' if found to have acted inappropriately. Judd, the sheriff, wouldn't discuss the legislators' proposal for him to help the department. But in an email to the AP, he said he was willing to help Lakeland. 'My whole family is from Lakeland. I grew up here,' Judd wrote. 'I care about Lakeland, its reputation, and the quality of life we enjoy here. 'We cannot lose sight that there are many fine and hardworking officers at LPD who are outstanding public servants.'","Sue Eberle is married with two children and admits having sex with up to a dozen officers .

A movie producer who worked on horror films including Scream and The Hills Have Eyes, has revealed the emotional trauma of being stalked by her boyfriend. Marianna Maddalena is suing the man she thought she was having a loving relationship with, after he admitted to installing spy software on her computer and impersonating her in emails to friends and family. Miss Maddalena thought she was losing her mind and started to see a therapist, as friends and co-workers began to cut ties from her, a California court heard. Stalked: Scream producer Marianne Maddalena is suing her ex-boyfriend after he was arrested for using spy software to track her emails and impersonate her . It was only when she received a reply to an email she knew she had not sent that Miss Maddalena began to suspect her boyfriend was tracking her. She is now suing Derrick John Toole for defamation, stalking and impersonating her. The 48-year-old Woodland Hills contractor pleaded guilty to illegal wiretapping and computer access and fraud in November last year and was sentenced to five years' probation. The couple, who did not live together, had been dating 'on and off' since 2007 and Miss Maddalena believed she was 'in a loving, safe and enjoyable relationship'. The movie producer claimed Toole 'used . surreptitious software and other manipulative technology to start to . spin a web of deceit, defamation, interference, trespass, and mind games' according to the complaint. Damaged: Marianne Maddalena, left, with Bonnie Arnold at a luncheon in 2011. The movie producer claims her ex-boyfriend's actions damaged her professional reputation . Toole allegedly installed Spectorsoft Eblaster spyware on the producer's laptop and set it to send reports of her emails and passwords, as well as details of she spoke to on instant messenger. It is claimed that he also installed a tracking device on the car of Miss Maddalena, a long-time work partner of horror film director Wes Craven, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Miss Maddalena said having her identity 'hijack[ed]' by Toole destroyed many of her working and personal . relationships, made her anxious, paranoid and untrusting, and caused her to lose thousands of dollars in income by damaging . her professional reputation. When the FBI searched Toole's home, they found about 7,000 printed reports on Miss Maddalena, including emails, attachments and bank statements, stored in a plastic container. He allegedly used the information to 'falsely depict himself as . her in writing emails, other electronic messages, and texts to family . members, friends and co-workers'. The complaint added that Toole impersonated her to family and friends to portray her 'as not caring, and wanting . them out of her life or business. He also sent family members Ms. Maddalena's private and personal emails sent to others in confidence to . embarrass and mortify her and others'. As her friends started to keep their distance Miss Maddalena said she believed she was going crazy. In January 2011 however, she received a reply to an email she knew she had not sent, and hired computer experts to check her computers. Horror film: Drew Barrymore in Scream, which Marianne Maddalena was executive producer for . When she confronted him, he allegedly threatened to reveal sensitive information about her and began to threaten her family and harass her, it is alleged. The producer is seeking an injunction and several thousand dollars in compensatory damages,  punitive damages for violations of federal cybercrime laws, intentional infliction of emotional distress, trespass, defamation, assault, battery, stalking, false light, public disclosure of private facts, and other offenses. Miss Maddalena, who is currently working on romantic movie Jerusalem I Love You, is also seeking reimbursement for her counseling and medical expenses. At his sentencing for cyber fraud in November, Toole said: 'I think I kind of got caught up in bad behavior, and I didn't realize how much I hurt somebody,' according to Daily News Los Angeles. Toole could not be reached for comment. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Marianna Maddalena discovered deceit after finding fake email .

A legal watchdog has agreed to investigate a complaint against two barristers from the Leveson inquiry who have had an affair. The decision by the Bar Standards Board comes nearly three months after a lawyer to the inquiry into media standards, Carine Patry Hoskins, was revealed to have embarked on a relationship with a barrister representing celebrities complaining about the Press. Conservative MP Rob Wilson has led calls for an inquiry into whether the relationship between the mother-of-two, who is now divorced, and David Sherborne, a barrister representing advocates of statutory Press regulation, could have compromised its findings. Inquiry: A legal watchdog has agreed to investigate a complaint against two barristers from the Leveson inquiry who have had an affair. David Sherborne , left, Carine Patry Hoskins, right, are pictured . A professional code of conduct suggests affairs between opposing lawyers should be avoided lest the perception be created of ‘a danger of a breach of confidence or other conspiracy’. According to a well-placed source, the Bar Standards Board has started to investigate the complaint from Mr Wilson into potential breaches of its code of conduct, though no public announcement has been made. Mr Sherborne, who represented Hugh Grant and other celebrity victims of phone hacking, went on holiday to the Greek island of Santorini with Miss Patry Hoskins in August last year. The visit took place while the inquiry was being conducted, although the couple claim they simply discussed the ‘possibility of a future relationship and decided against it’. They say they changed their minds later but claim their affair did not begin until after the controversial Leveson report was published in November. Firm: Lord Justice Leveson has flatly rejected any suggestion that his report into Press standards may have been tainted by the relationship . Lord Justice Leveson has flatly rejected any suggestion that his report into Press standards may have been tainted by the relationship – and insisted that ‘every finding of fact, every conclusion and every recommendation’ in the report was his alone. The judge is expected to face further questions on the issue after agreeing to appear before MPs on the Commons culture, media and sport committee. Critics of the inquiry who have raised questions about the relationship are now expected to submit information to the board. It will normally carry out an initial assessment before deciding whether to undertake a formal investigation which could lead to a disciplinary tribunal. The body can impose punishments ranging from words of advice, fines or suspension to ultimately having a barrister struck off. A spokesman for the board said: ‘Our rules make it clear that we cannot comment on individual cases unless a formal disciplinary tribunal has been scheduled.’ Mr Wilson declined to comment. Miss Patry Hoskins became known as ‘woman on the left’ and received thousands of mentions on Twitter for her close attention to actor Hugh Grant’s evidence during the 97-day inquiry. Her fees amounted to £218,606 between July 2011 and November 2012 for her work on the team appointed by Lord Justice Leveson. In the Commons yesterday, Nick Clegg said the Privy Council should be given time to give ‘objective’ consideration to the newspaper and magazine industry’s alternative to the cross-party Royal Charter on Press regulation produced in response to the Leveson report. The council, an advisory body to the Queen, will meet today to consider the industry’s charter. More than 200 publishers are expected to sign up to a new regulator, called the Independent Press Standards Organisation, which will have the power to impose fines of up to £1million and require editors to publish upfront apologies. Liberal Democrat deputy leader Simon Hughes asked Mr Clegg: ‘In the interests of the victims of Press intrusion and many others, can you confirm that the charter agreed by this House and all parties for Press regulation will be put to the Privy Council at the earliest possible opportunity for agreement?’ The Deputy Prime Minister, who is Lord President of the Privy Council and is likely to chair today’s meeting, replied: ‘Of course I can confirm we will do so at the earliest opportunity but first, as you know, we need to respect the processes of the Privy Council and a rival charter has been submitted for consideration. ‘We need to make sure that is properly examined in a way that is objective and is not subject to undue interference.’","Affair was between David Sherborne and Carine Patry Hoskins .

The president and CEO of the railway's parent company says an employee failed to properly set the brakes of the train that crashed into a town in Quebec, killing at least 15 people while another 45 remain missing. Edward Burkhardt made the comments during a visit Wednesday to the town that was devastated by the runaway oil train four days ago. 'It was questionable whether hand brakes were put I place at this time,' Burkhardt said. 'I don't think any employees removed brakes. They failed to set the brakes.' 'I think he did something wrong ...We think he applied some hand brakes but the question is did he apply enough of them. 'He said he applied 11 hand brakes we think that's not true. Initially we believed him but now we don't.' Scroll down for videos . Inferno: 15 people are now confirmed dead and 45 are still missing as the train company president said the accident was caused by an employee failing to lock the set the brakes . Razed: The number of people missing who may have been vaporized in the explosion is now up to 45 . What went wrong: Safety inspectors search the wreckage for clues on Wednesday as they try to determine the cause of the crash. The company president made the announcement about the brakes today as well . In memory: A makeshift memorial is set up, as much of the town is still struggling with the possibility that 60 people died in the crash. The lack of bodies hints that they may have vaporized in the heat . He said a train engineer has been suspended without pay. All told, 15 bodies have been found but they are so badly burned that they are unidentifiable. That . number does not include the 15 people whose bodies were burnt so badly . that they are unidentifiable, bringing the total number up to 60. Burkhardt said that he had stayed in Chicago to deal with the crisis in his office, where he was better able to communicate with insurers and officials in different places during what he described as 20-hour work days. At a press conference, shortly before Burkhardt was due to arrive in Lac-Megantic, Quebec Premier Pauline Marois faulted the company's response in the wake of the disaster. 'We have realized there are serious gaps from the railway company from not having been there and not communicating with the public,' Marois said. She also announced a $60million fund to help victims in Lac-Megantic and to rebuild the town. Burkhardt . visited the devastated town a day after police announced they were . pursuing a painstaking, wide-ranging criminal investigation of the . inferno ignited by the derailment of the oil train that demolished the . center of this lakeside town of 6,000. Flanked . by reporters at Montreal's Trudeau airport Tuesday evening, Burkhardt . suggested firefighters who extinguished an earlier fire on the same . train shared some of the blame. Long road ahead: Rescue workers comb the debris for evidence of survivors following the huge train crash on Saturday which devastated the small town of Lac-Megantic in Quebec . 'We . have responsibility for this incident. We don't have total . responsibility but we have partial responsibility,' Burkhardt said in . remarks broadcast on CTV. Quebec . police inspector Michel Forget announced Wednesday morning that the . number of missing had risen to 60, a number that included the 15 bodies . recovered so far that have been burnt beyond recognition. Police had . earlier put the number of missing at 50. Mr . Forget said the numbers remained in flux as reports of missing people . trickled in or people believed to be missing turned out to be alive. Mr . Forget had earlier ruled out terrorism as a cause, but said that an . array of other possibilities remain under investigation, including . criminal negligence. Other officials have raised the possibility that . the train was tampered with before the crash early Saturday. Debris: Terrorism has been ruled out as a possible cause but there is still a criminal investigation underway . Shells: Burnt cars are seen near the train wreckage which was traveling far too fast when it went off the rails, investigators told reporters on Tuesday . 'We're not at the stage of arrests.' The . heart of the town's central business district is being treated as a . crime scene and remained cordoned off by police tape - not only the 30 . buildings razed by the fire but also many adjacent blocks. On . downtown's main street - Rue de Laval - police positioned a truck near . the perimeter of the no-go zone, which prevented news crews from getting . direct photo and video views of the search operations being conducted . by some 200 officers. Police . officials left no doubt that the hunt for the missing people was taxing . - they said two officers were withdrawn from the sector because of . worries about their physical condition. 'This . is a very risky environment,' said Quebec Provincial Police Sgt. Benoit . Richard. 'We have to secure the safety of those working there. We have . some hotspots on the scene. There is some gas.' The . Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway train broke loose early Saturday . and hurtled downhill through the darkness nearly seven miles (11 . kilometers) before jumping the tracks at 63 mph (101 kph) in . Lac-Megantic, in eastern Quebec near the Maine border, investigators . said. All but one of the 73 cars were carrying oil. At least five . exploded. Still standing: The Sainte-Agnes Catholic Church stands unscathed next to the derailment and blast site . Vast devastation: A police officer walks amongst axle gear and the battered tankers which careered downhill . Desolate: Burnt down houses and cars are seen near the train wreckage where 40 people remain unaccounted for amid fears that their bodies may have vaporized in the extreme heat . Terror: Burnt cars are seen near the train wreckage in Lac Megantic on Saturday. The crude oil freight train derailed and blew up causing residents to run for their lives . Rail dispatchers . had no chance to warn anyone during the runaway train's 18-minute . journey because they didn't know it was happening themselves, . Transportation Safety Board officials said. Such warning systems are in place on busier lines but not on secondary lines, said TSB manager Ed Belkaloul. At . the center of the destruction is the Musi-Cafe, a popular bar that was . filled at the time of the explosion, which also forced about 2,000 of . the town's 6,000 residents from their homes. By . Tuesday, only about 800 were still barred from returning to their . houses, though residents were cautioned to boil tap water before . drinking it. Efforts . continued to stop waves of crude oil spilled in the disaster from . reaching the St. Lawrence River, the backbone of the province's water . supply. Investigators . searching for a cause of the accident are looking closely at the fire . that happened on the train less than an hour before it got loose while . parked in the nearby town of Nantes. Carnage: Emergency workers are seen at the site of the train wreckage in the small French-Canadian town close to Montreal . Smouldering: A single column of a building still stands as the rest of the structure has been reduced to rubble around it . The . train's engine was shut down - standard operating procedure dictated by . the train's owners, Nantes Fire Chief Patrick Lambert said. Burkhardt . suggested that shutting off the locomotive to put out the fire might . have disabled the brakes. 'The . train had the engine shut down by the firemen, they didn't do that for . malicious purposes by it's what happens,' Burkhardt told reporters at . the Montreal airport. 'The . firemen should have roused the locomotive engineer who was in his hotel . and taken him to the scene with them. But it's easy to say what should . have happened. We're dealing with what happened.' Lambert . defended the fire department, saying that the blaze was extinguished . within about 45 minutes and that's when firefighters' involvement ended. The . accident has thrown a spotlight on MMA's safety record: over the past . decade, the company has consistently recorded a much higher accident . rate than the national average in the U.S., according to data from the . Federal Railroad Administration. Last . year, for instance, the railroad had 36.1 accidents per million miles . traveled by its trains. The national average for 2012 was 14.6. Crushed: The tankers may have been tampered with, transport officials said on Tuesday . Fearing the worst: Exhausted firefighters take a much-needed break on a set of train wheels as they worked to recover the now 45 suspected missing residents . Before . the Lac-Megantic accident, the company had 34 derailments since 2003, . according to the federal agency. Over that period, the company was . involved in five accidents that had reportable damage of more than . $100,000. The severity of . those incidents, however, is difficult to determine from the federal . agency's 10-year data overviews on railroad safety. But . before the weekend accident, incidents involving the company's trains . had resulted in just one death. That 2006 accident involved a vehicle . that struck a moving train at a highway crossing. Burkhardt said the figures were misleading. 'This . is the only significant mainline derailment this company has had in the . last 10 years. We've had, like most railroads, a number of smallish . incidents, usually involving accidents in yard trackage and industry . trackage,' he told the CBC. Hard choices: Emergency personnel look over the debris from a runaway train as a crane removes some of the destruction . Melded: Piles of destroyed cars are heaped together showing the force of the explosion . Nonetheless, . Burkhardt predicted the accident would lead to changes in the way . railways operate, and indicated that MMA would no longer leave loaded . trains unattended, a practice he said was standard in the industry. The . tanker cars involved in the crash were the DOT-111 type - a staple of . the American freight rail fleet whose flaws have been noted as far back . as a 1991 safety study. Experts . say the DOT-111's steel shell is so thin that it is prone to puncture . in an accident, potentially spilling cargo that can catch fire, explode . or contaminate the environment.","15 dead but unidentified because of bad burns after train carrying crude oil derailed and exploded on Saturday after several tankers came loose .

The Afghan National Army Officer Academy, expected to open early next year, will focus on military tactics and leadership to defeat the Taliban.

'There's always been a zero option, . but it was not seen as the main option,' a senior Western official in . Kabul told the New York Times. 'It is now becoming one of them, and if you listen to some people in Washington, it is maybe now being seen as a realistic path.' A full-scale pullout would have serious implications for Prime Minister David Cameron over his plan to open the 'Sandhurst in the sand'. Senior sources in Whitehall insisted the UK remained 'committed' to opening the academy but military commanders will urge politicians to reconsider the plan if the US withdraws all troops. Top brass would question whether the safety of 170 British service personnel could be compromised if only a small number of Nato troops remain in the warzone. Major Charles Heyman, who edits the British Army handbook, said: 'If the US pulled everything out we would have to pull out in parallel, and so would the Germans, French, Italians and other Nato forces. It would be too dangerous to stay.' But he said the prospect was 'highly unlikely'. 'This seems to be a bit of a kite-flying exercise by the US to concentrate Karzai's mind on negotiations over security,' said Maj Heyman. The US and Afghanistan have been in talks for months over a long-term security deal involving how many troops and bases the Nato-led coalition should leave in the war-torn country and the speed of the withdrawal. But the relationship between President Obama and President Karzai reached a new low last month after the US attempted to begin peace talks with the Taliban. This led to President Karzai suspending negotiations on the security pact, which could be worth as much as £5.3billion a year to Kabul. Changes: Washington sources say Obama is considering leaving President Karzai, pictured, to run Afghanistan's security services himself . Reassurance needed: Whitehall sources have said if all US troops were to withdraw, British and other NATO forces would have to follow suit . A June 27 video conference between the pair aimed at defusing tensions ended badly, according to US officials. They raised the prospect that the US could accelerate the drawdown to bring the bulk of the troops home next summer. The number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan - now around 63,000 - already is set to decline to 34,000 by February. But Afghanistan played down the possibility of President Obama ordering a complete withdrawal. One senior official in Kabul said: 'Both sides understand how to pressure each other. But both the U.S. and Afghanistan fully understand the need for foreign troops, especially U.S. ones, to stay beyond 2014. 'That it is vital for security here and in the wider region. We don't think the U.S. will compromise on that, because past experience of abandoning Afghanistan was that the country descended into chaos.' Last month it was revealed that Britain was coming under pressure to keep additional troops in Afghanistan for up to five years after the end of combat operations in 2014. A senior military commander said Nato personnel would be needed to provide medical evacuation and logistics, plan helicopter operations and integrate ground combat with air support.","Around 170 troops committed to opening of new academy in Kabul .

Shareholders told Marks & Spencer bosses yesterday that some stores are like a throwback to the classic BBC sitcom Are You Being Served?

Mr Bolland is now under huge pressure to win back customers who have switched to rivals such as Zara and Primark.

Producers caused outraged when they broadcast the outcome of her affair on Radio 4's sister station . When an Ambridge stalwart began an affair with her husband’s brother, regular listeners knew it was only a matter of time before they were treated to a huge marital showdown. So dedicated fans of Radio 4 soap The Archers were understandably upset when BBC schedulers ruined months of suspense – and played the key scene on its digital spin-off show instead. Hundreds of listeners have expressed their fury at being ‘cheated’ of the chance to follow the crucial story line to its conclusion. Some pointed out the show is a favourite among older listeners, many of whom do not have access to a digital radio or the internet, while another said: ‘No point in listening to the Archers again, if one does not get all the story line.’ The showdown between property developer Matt Crawford and his wife Lilian Bellamy was played on Ambridge Extra, which was set up in 2011 to give Archers addicts behind-the-scenes material to supplement the main Radio 4 show. The programme is broadcast on Radio 4 Extra, meaning it can only be accessed with a digital radio, through a digital television or online. Since November, fans of the rural soap have been kept in suspense as Lilian continued a clandestine affair with Matt’s brother Paul. Although the romance was cut short by Paul’s unexpected death from a heart attack last month, listeners were kept on tenterhooks by the knowledge that Matt had discovered his wife was unfaithful months earlier but chose to keep silent. Last week, he finally confronted her with the knowledge, exclaiming: ‘Oh for God’s sake Lilian, stop lying. I know you were sleeping with Paul. I know you were screwing my brother, alright.’ However, the dramatic scene was heard by just a quarter of The Archers’ regular fans. The main programme on Radio 4 is heard by an average of 5.1million listeners each week, while just 1.6million tune in to Radio 4 Extra. Many of those who missed the scene wrote to the BBC’s own Radio 4 programme Feedback – which regularly discusses listeners’ views – to complain. One said: ‘I’m outraged at the way in which the ordinary listener to the Archers has been deprived of listening to this scene…I think people who listen to the Archers on ordinary steam or FM radio should have been able to hear this scene. Popular: The Archers is listened to by an average of 5.1million viewers a week . 'If we can’t hear the scenes for ourselves, we might as well just read the summaries and not bother with the radio at all. Is this what the BBC want?’ Others took to online fan forums to air their discontent. One said: ‘Thousands of Archers fans are of an age where they neither have, now want, a computer/laptop/tablet/smartphone (talking loo, radio toothbrush, or any other gizmo), so they are missing out on these plotlines.’ A second added: ‘‘Thumbs down to the Archer’s producer for putting the Lillian & Matt storyline on Ambridge Extra. 'I'm outraged at the way in which the ordinary listener to the Archers has been deprived of listening to this scene.' Angry Archers fan . 'I am regular listener of Archers and very angry at this after hearing it on BBC Feedback. No point in listening to the Archers again, if one does not get all the story line.’ A third said: ‘Join in the protest. Switch off your radio at 7.05 every day next week in protest of producers switching main story-lines from The Archers to Ambridge Radio 4 Extra.’ Stand-in Archers editor Julie Beckett, who took over from Vanessa Whitburn in May, defended the scheduling decision to Feedback. She said: ‘Almost everybody I believe has access to digital television and Ambridge Extra is available on there. 'What we wanted to do was to take this lovely moment and project us into a story which will in fact be carried on both series this time. 'So you will be hearing aspects of the story in Ambridge Extra and in the Archers. ‘Those listeners who listen to both will get the whole story, but if you listen to one or the other you will hopefully get a satisfying story there as well. Outcry: The BBC defended the scheduling decision to Feedback . 'If you do feel frustrated by that [not hearing the scene] there are plenty of places you can go and hear that moment.’ But one listener said: ‘I’ve got internet, but I never knew - till today - that the R4Extra stuff was anything other than tongue-in-cheek alternative episodes! 'If I had known, I’d have certainly set my DAB to record the “Extra” progs. Now I feel very definitely cheated out of who knows what extra plotlines that really should have been mainstream Archers, not R4Extra!!’ Now in its fifth series Ambridge Extra airs two 15-minute episodes every week to supplement the main programme, which is aired daily on Radio 4. When it was created in 2011, the BBC said it would run ‘in parallel’ with the main show and promised listeners would not miss out on vital plotlines if they did not listen to the digital series.","The climax of an affair storyline was broadcast on Radio 4 Extra .

An Irn-Bru advert showing a curvaceous mother discussing her cleavage with her horrified teenage son has been deemed acceptable by the advertising watchdog despite 176 complaints. The television ad features buxom actress Marianne Adams, 43, in a tightly-fitting pink cardigan telling her son: 'New push-up bra. Amazing eh?' as his friends ogle her breasts. But the son's shock and embarrassment faded as he sipped Irn-Bru and he responds: 'Looking good mum.' His mother then gives him a big cuddle before suggesting a 'group hug' to which his friends agree enthusiastically. See the advert below . Fury: The Irn-Bru advert starring Marianne Adams, 43, as a buxom mother has prompted more than 170 complaints from viewers . Cheeky: The advert shows a mother in a tight-fitting pink cardigan who then tells her embarrassed son and his two delighted friends: 'New push-up bra. Amazing eh?' Viewers complained the relationship between the mother and her teenage son's friends is inappropriate . The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said many of the complaints believed the ad was offensive and irresponsible because they the scenario between the mother and the young men was 'sexual and inappropriate'. But it has ruled that the advert was not irresponsible, sexist or demeaning and focused on the son's embarrassment rather than the mother trying to seduce her son's friends. The ASA said: 'Although we noted that . some complainants had interpreted the action in the ads as portraying . an inappropriate relationship between the mum and the son's friends, we . did not consider that their interaction was a portrayal of irresponsible . behaviour. 'We considered that the action relied . on the mum being confident and attractive, but not consciously or . overtly behaving in a sexualised or flirtatious way. Eye-catching: The teenager's friends can be seen ogling his mother's breasts as she bends down to clean the table . Awkward: The teenager looks distinctively uncomfortable as his friends stare at his attractive mother . But his embarrassment is eased when he takes a sip of Irn-Bru - then telling his mother: 'Looking good, mum' 'We also considered . that the focus of the ads was the son's embarrassment at the effect his . mum's appearance was having on his friends. 'Therefore, and particularly in the . context of ads intended to portray a surreal and light-hearted comedic . approach, we did not consider that the action or depiction of the female . protagonist was sexist or demeaning and concluded that the ads were not . in breach of the code.' The ASA ruled that no further action was necessary. Others complained that the ad was sexist and demeaning to women, while some were concerned that it was inappropriately scheduled at a time when children could have been viewing. Too close for comfort: But his relief is short-lived when his mother grabs him by the head for a tight cuddle . 'Group hug': And when his mother suggests a big group hug, the teenagers friends are more than happy to oblige . Cleared: The ASA found that the advert was not irresponsible as it concentrated on the embarrassment of the son . Irn-Bru manufacturer AG Barr said it wanted the ad to 'stay true to the traditionally cheeky and irreverent sense of humour' of previous campaigns but not to 'objectify women, carry any tone of a sexual nature or cause offence'. It said the focus of the ad was the son's embarrassment and the comedic concept that Irn-Bru would help him deal with such an awkward situation. It added that the young men were not reacting in a way that portrayed sexuality or colluding in a salacious fashion, but were rather transfixed by the mother's appearance.","Ad features buxom actress Marianne .

Grief: Christopher and Lisa Avery-Wright after the inquest into the death of their son William outside the Worth School in West Sussex where he was a pupil . The father of a public schoolboy has criticised his school for announcing his death to other parents before he had been told. William Avery-Wright, 13, died after being knocked down by a 4x4 outside his school as he crossed a road to play in a rugby match. His father, Christopher Avery-Wright, said Worth School, near Turners Hill, Crawley, West Sussex, sent out an email to parents after William had been and injured. Then around half an hour later another email without his knowledge was sent to parents announcing William’s death - while Mr Avery-Wright was still unaware on a train from London, he said. As he was on the train, Mr Avery-Wright said he started receiving messages of condolence via text from people who had received the school’s email. William’s mother, Lisa Avery-Wright, had already arrived at the hospital but she was advised not to break the news of her death to her husband until he was there too. Following an inquest into his death today, Mr Avery-Wright condemned the school, saying it had acted 'appallingly' and that its actions had caused 'incredible pain'. They are suing the school, where William excelled at cricket, rugby and football, after claiming he should have been supervised by an adult across the road. The Roman Catholic school, which also posted a statement on its website about William’s death, has previously said it published the information in 'good faith' but its initial belief that both his parents had been told about the tragedy turned out to be 'incorrect'. Today, following the two-day inquest at Crawley Town Hall, West Sussex assistant deputy coroner Bridget Dolan recorded a verdict of accidental death. Tragedy: William Avery-Wright died as he crossed a road outside his school on the way to play rugby . No mention was made by her in her closing remarks about the way in which the school disclosed William’s death before his father had been told. Ms Dolan had said the inquest’s focus was on three matters - the events of the day of the crash, the school’s road crossing policy and what changes have been made since William’s death. The coroner ruled out submissions by the family’s solicitor that William died as a result of neglect but she did say school rules had not been 'adhered to'. Outside the hearing, Mr Avery-Wright, from Crowborough, East Sussex, said: 'I think the school behaved inappropriately. They decided to announce to the school parents by email that William had died.' Distraught: Christopher Avery-Wright (pictured with William) started receiving messages of condolence before he had been informed of his son's death . 'It caused incredible pain. I think if a child dies in the school’s custody there should be reconciliation and we feel the school behaved appallingly to Lisa and me in that reconciliation. He added: 'When I was collected by the police at 4.30pm, I was getting text messages to say that William had died and clearly I had no knowledge of whether this was true or incorrect. 'It was only at 5.30pm when I got to the hospital to be met by my wife that my worst fears were confirmed.' The inquest heard that William was crossing a road with a friend as they headed to play in a school rugby match when he was hit by a Land Rover Defender. The driver of the 4x4, Graham Voller, said he was travelling at around 40mph in a 60mph zone with his grand-daughter at the time of the incident. Mr Voller told the inquest: 'I got to a short distance of the crossing and through the side window I just saw someone on the side of the road. I only saw one (person). The teenager died after being knocked down by a 4x4 outside Worth School, near Turners Hill, Crawley, West Sussex, as he crossed a road to play in a rugby match . 'And then the young lad just arrived in front of the Land Rover. Just as the boy hit the Land Rover I did an emergency stop. I had little time to react. 'When I stopped, I got out of the Land Rover and looked to see the boy, and got straight on to the mobile phone.' Mr Voller will not face criminal charges over the crash, which happened on a road he said he travelled on up to 15 times a day, the inquest heard. William, a sporty teenager who played golf at county level, was pronounced dead from multiple injuries at East Surrey Hospital in Redhill, Surrey, on November 30 2011. William, a sporty teenager who played golf at county level, was pronounced dead from multiple injuries at East Surrey Hospital . The boy who was with William when he was struck described in a statement to police how he 'froze' and how the crash had left him in 'disbelief'. Moments before the crash, he explained how he mentioned to William that his sock was down. He told police: 'I was looking at my shoe and then after two seconds, I looked up at Will. He was on the pavement. 'I saw him running and stop, and (Will) said, ""Oh my God"", and then the whole thing happened.' He added: 'I didn’t see the car before it all happened.' The boy said he had crossed the road before without adult supervision and that he had not been made to wait for a teacher to help him across. Alan Mitchell, a teacher at Worth School who had overall responsibility for the games department, faced questions about the school’s policy on safe road crossing for pupils. Under the school’s rules, he said students in Years 7 and 8 had to have adult supervision when crossing the road. William was in Year 8. Questioned by the Avery-Wrights’ solicitor, Mr Mitchell said the policies did not state what should happen if a student is late. He added: 'I would’ve expected (pupils) to go to games staff or a member of the house.' Mr Mitchell said the policy was communicated to pupils via the bursar who would give them a health and safety talk at the start of the year. He added that staff would be expected to read policies. Worth School headmaster Gino Carminati agreed that the road where William was killed, Paddockhurst Road, was regarded as one of the top 10 risks at the school. He told the inquest the school insisted at the time on pupils from Years 7 and 8 being accompanied across the road by an adult, with enforcement of the policy delegated to the head of department. However, the inquest heard statements from some pupils who were unaware of the school's policy that they should be aided by an adult to cross the road. Tribute: A message appeared on the website announcing the 13-year-olds death . Mr Carminati said pupils were informed of the policy by the bursar who acts on health and safety issues, and they were reminded half-termly by housemasters and in assemblies. Mr Carminati said: 'I believe that the policies we had at the time were adequate for what we had to do. 'They were reviewed annually, there were no reports coming through at any level to suggest that the policies were inadequate and not being followed appropriately.' He said that pupils running late for games, as William was, should turn back to seek adult help if they find no one at the road to assist them. Since his death, no pupils are allowed to cross the road without adult help and the school has put in place a chaperone. The school has pressed the local authority for a reduction in speed on the road from 60mph to 40mph, and there is lobbying for a further cut to 30mph, he added. Upset: William's mother Lisa Avery-Wright (pictured) and his father are suing the school for failure in its duty of care to their son . Planning permission has been granted for a footbridge which should be built by September, enabling pupils and staff to cross to the field without using the road. In the meantime, a temporary road crossing has been installed which will be removed once the footbridge has been built, the inquest was told. Andrew Ekinsmyth, of West Sussex County Council, said there were four recorded crashes on Paddockhurst Road in 10 years but none involved pedestrians. Recording her verdict, Ms Dolan said: 'I don't find in this case there is sufficient evidence to find a gross failure of basic case to someone in obvious need where the school did have a policy and did take steps even though in some respects the accommodation of that policy wasn't successful.' She said the speed of the driver was 'appropriate' and the driver braked before impact. Ms Dolan added: 'It appears to me, for whatever reason, William was inattentive when he crossed the road. There was an ability to see an oncoming vehicle.' Outside the hearing, Mrs Avery-Wright said: 'We feel very strongly that we put a huge amount of trust in the school and unfortunately those expectations were not met. 'We are going to continue our civil litigation case with the school in conjunction with our solicitors.' Worth School later apologised for its failure to ensure pupils from Years 7 and 8 were accompanied across the road by an adult. In a statement following the inquest, it said: 'The school respects and accepts the coroner's verdict of accident. 'Her findings reflect the school's admission that the rule that Year 7 and 8 pupils should be escorted across the Paddockhurst Road was not enforced or adhered to. 'For this failure the school apologises. In the aftermath of the tragic accident which befell William, the school has secured with the council a reduction in the speed limit along the road. 'Furthermore, a bridge is under construction to ensure that the grief suffered by Mr and Mrs Avery-Wright should not be endured by any other parents. Mr and Mrs Avery-Wright continue to be in the prayers of the whole school.'","William Avery-Wright was just 13 when he was killed crossing the road .

Cecile and Victor Stanton of Jericho, New York are suing Beverly Jeffries for $350,000, claiming that she won't give the dog back after they signed over temporary guardianship of the dog, officially named Polar Mist You Gotta Believe, to Jeffries in February. The suit, which is claiming damages for 'breach of contract, promissory fraud, and intentional infliction of severe emotional distress', contends that Jeffries also had the champion stud neutered without their permission. (FILE PHOTO) Prize: Prize show dog and stud Justin, AKA Polar Mist You Gotta Believe, has allegedly been kidnapped and neutered by a woman who was looking after him . The precious pooch, which answers to Justin, was allegedly worth $250,000, but now that he's been desexed, he's lost at least $100,000 in value, says the couple. According to papers filed in a Pasadena, California court, the Stantons signed over temporary guardianship of the dog to Jeffries in February, but retained ownership. When the couple asked for the dog back in May, Jeffries refused, and the couple discovered the animal had been neutered in April without their permission. The Stantons bought the dog in 2006, and he's an American Kennel Club registered Grand Champion. According to the Courthouse News, . the complaint reads: 'The plaintiffs, especially Cecile Stanton, have . developed a strong personal relationship with Justin and always expected . him to be returned promptly upon request.' (FILE PHOTO) Best in show: Cecile Stanton's Facebook profile has photos of many past dog shows her animals have competed in . 'Because of the behavior of the defendant by neutering Justin and not returning him, the plaintiffs have been severely distressed, losing sleep, being frequently upset during the daytime, and generally worried that the irrational behavior of the defendants will cause further harm to Justin and cause further separation between Justin and the plaintiffs who dearly want him returned.'

"By . Sophie Borland and Ben Spencer . PUBLISHED: . 18:27 EST, 10 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:43 EST, 11 July 2013 . Suspended: Consultant obstetrician Rod Irvine is being investigated by the General Medical Council . A surgeon has been suspended over fears that he botched the operations of hundreds of women. Rod Irvine, a consultant obstetrician, is being investigated by the General Medical Council after it emerged that he may have made potentially life-threatening errors during routine operations. Hospital bosses have written to 2,000 women who have undergone surgery with Mr Irvine in the past ten years warning them that their treatment is under review. An initial investigation has found he made some form of mistake in a quarter of all procedures. Such a rate could mean that up to 500 women have suffered under his hands. Mr Irvine, 60, had worked at Queen Mary’s hospital, Sidcup, South East London, since 2002 and also practised at Guy’s and St Thomas’ hospitals in central London. He specialised in procedures including hysterectomies, the removal of cancerous tumours, screening for cervical cancer and caesareans. He also worked for several private London hospitals including the Portland, the Lister and the Wellington in Harley Street. Concerns were raised last year when a routine audit of his operations at Queen Mary’s revealed an abnormally high number of complications among patients. The hospital subsequently reviewed the treatment of 255 of his most recent patients and found that mistakes had been made in 66 cases. These included 17 women where there was a ‘serious cause for concern’. Some are believed to have suffered a perforated bowel, which is fatal in 10 per cent of cases. Concern: The investigation began after a routine audit of Mr Irvine's work at Queen Mary's Hospital in Sidcup, Kent . The hospital would not confirm whether any women had died and it said it was too early to say how many had been harmed. The women have been told that their medical records will be checked to see if there is any evidence they suffered complications caused by incompetence. Most of the women had surgery several years ago and the hospital played down the chance that some had been harmed without yet being aware anything was wrong. However, women will be urged to come forward for treatment to correct any mistakes that may have occurred. Only last month the NHS began publishing the death rates of thousands of surgeons amid concerns that badly-performing doctors are being allowed to make mistakes unnoticed. Mr Irvine also worked at St Thomas' hospital in central London . Mr Irvine was suspended in November last year when concerns were first surfaced. He is now being investigated by the GMC, which could decide to strike him off the register. The watchdog has temporarily banned him from carrying out any private work. Queen Mary’s hospital is run by South London Healthcare, which last year became the first NHS trust to be put into administration after accumulating debts of £150million. Dr Chris Palin, its medical director, said: ‘It is unlikely that patients will need treatment. But it’s important that we review the relevant patient notes to check whether anything went wrong, to acknowledge any mistakes that may have happened, and – if necessary – to put things right. ‘All surgery involves risk and can lead to complications. But wherever we find cause for concern it’s important that we explore the reasons for this. That’s why we have written to the women concerned and explained that we will be reviewing their clinical notes.’ Emerging from his large detached home in Caterham, Surrey, last night, Mr Irvine refused to comment. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Rod Irvine, consultant obstetrician, under investigation by medical watchdog .

Both were attacked by a fox that invaded their home in Catford, south east London . A couple have told how they were attacked by a crazed fox in their own home as they fought to rescue their pet cat from its jaws. Anthony Schofield, 49, suffered a fractured wrist and two inch-wide bite wounds while his girlfriend Tammy Chapple, 36, had her finger badly bitten. The ‘mangy’ animal managed to sneak into their home in Catford, south east London. It surprised Mr Schofield by appearing in the bathroom. He tried to chase it out of the house but the fox then escaped to the living room, where it started to attack his 14-year-old rescue cat Jessie. Mr Schofield said: ‘I was in the bathroom and I saw what I thought was our dog nudge the door open in front of me. ‘I couldn’t believe it when I saw this mangy little fox.’ The animal then darted into the  living room, where it sank its teeth into their cat’s face. ‘It went for Jessie ferociously. She tried to escape by clambering up the curtain but the fox was clawing at her and bit through her jaw,’ he said. ‘I hate to think what would have happened if she had been a baby.’ Mr Schofield, who is a carpenter, tried to pull the fox away from his pet but it clamped its jaws around his wrist instead. He added: ‘The fox was madly swinging around from my wrist, trying to scramble for the cat. ‘It was wild and incredibly strong. I am not a weak man but I could not for the life of me manage to open its jaw on my wrist.’ When it finally let go, the animal attacked trainee teacher Miss Chapple as she tried to pull the cat to safety. Mr Schofield ended up dragging it to the garden where it made its escape. The fox's bite was so powerful it fractured Mr Schofield's wrist . Their dog, a Staffordshire bull terrier called Clementine, missed her chance to save the day as she was locked in the kitchen at the time. Following the ordeal, which Mr Schofield described as a ‘living nightmare, they were forced to go to hospital to seek medical assistance. Their cat Jessie, who suffered facial injuries, is now too scared to go into the living room. Yesterday the couple insisted more action needs to be taken to tackle the problem of urban foxes. The incident follows a spate of attacks on pets and children over the last few years. Nine-month-old twins Lola and  Isabella Koupparis were mauled in their cot by a fox in Hackney, east  London, in 2010 – leaving them both with horrific injuries. Blight: The couple insisted more action needs to be taken to tackle the problem of urban foxes . And in February, four-week-old Denny Dolan suffered hand and facial injuries when a fox dragged him from his cot in Bromley, south east London. In response, London Mayor Boris Johnson said he was considering a cull of urban foxes but admitted implementing it would be ‘difficult’. A survey on urban foxes for Channel 4 last year found that 36 per cent of city-dwellers admit to feeding them in their gardens. Wildlife experts have warned that today’s resourceful urban fox will take advantage of any open window or catflap when desperate for food. They say householders should take precautionary steps to secure their home against the animals.","Anthony Schofield suffered a fractured wrist from the 'mangy' animal .

Under plans to be unveiled in the autumn, English MPs would be able to reject legislation on NHS, education or local government reforms even if it had been passed by a majority of all MPs in the Commons. The move is designed to end the situation under which Scottish MPs can be used to force through laws that only concern England, against the wishes of English MPs. Changes: English MPs could be given the power to veto laws affecting only England, it emerged last night . The changes are likely to be fiercely resisted by Labour. Many of its MPs represent Scottish and Welsh constituencies and even if the party wins the general election it might not command a majority of MPs in England. At present, 67 of Labour’s 257 MPs represent Welsh or Scottish constituencies. The Tories have a notional majority of 68 over other parties with English MPs. The plans are being drawn up by Oliver Letwin, the Tory Cabinet Office Minister, and Danny Alexander, the Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury. Proposals: The plans are being drawn up by Oliver Letwin, pictured . The proposal favoured by ministers from . both parties would see legislation taking its usual course through the . Commons and the Lords. However, once a Bill has had its third reading in both houses, English MPs would be given a vote to ratify the legislation on policy areas that only affect England. If they rejected part or all of a piece of legislation, it would return to the House of Commons for further consultation or amendment. The reforms will form part of a package of constitutional changes that will also include plans to devolve further tax and borrowing powers to the Welsh Assembly. A senior minister told the Mail: ‘The idea is to give English MPs the right to ratify legislation that concerns England. It would effectively create a “fourth reading” of a bill on English-only matters. ‘Scotland has had devolution and is now voting on independence. Wales is going to get more powers. It would be wrong not to address the issue of England, too.’ The plans are a bid to solve the so-called ‘West Lothian Question’, named after the former Labour MP for West Lothian Tam Dalyell, who raised the issue of English MPs being overruled by Scots in a speech on devolution in 1977.","Could stop Scottish MPs from forcing through laws only affecting England .

A schizophrenic stabbed his girlfriend to death in front of two police officers and then blamed it on the BBC, a court heard today. Larry Parker, 54, repeatedly plunged an 18-inch kitchen knife into his long-term partner Lesley Larner after she tried to get medical help for him over the phone. The Old Bailey heard that police officers who arrived at the scene found Ms Larner, 58, covered in blood after suffering numerous stab wounds. Police were called to Sherwood Road, in west Ealing, where they found Ms Larner who had been stabbed by her long-term partner Larry Parker . They tried to stop Parker’s continuing onslaught using CS gas, but could do nothing to prevent him from delivering a fatal blow to her chest. After they managed to drag him away from his victim, he turned to the officers and said: 'It’s the BBC’s fault, it’s the BBC.' Parker, of West Ealing in west London, was yesterday given a hospital order after previously pleading guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The attack, which took place on the night of March 13 last year, began after Ms Larner woke up and found Parker on the floor. A man called 999 but eventually Ms Larner took the phone and explained that her boyfriend had been taking medication for Hepatitis C. The court heard that he could be heard in the background saying he did not want paramedics to attend. After midnight, neighbours were woken by what they described as fighting and a woman’s screams.They saw the defendant looking out from a window frame holding a large black kitchen knife. Prosecutor Oliver Glasgow told the court: 'The defendant looked up and said ""call an ambulance, someone has died here"".' The Old Bailey heard that police officers who arrived at the scene found Ms Larner covered in blood after suffering numerous stab wounds . In a further 999 call from the property the victim pleaded for help, telling the operator: 'Hurry up, I can’t breathe. I’m going to die.' When police officers arrived on the scene they told Parker to drop the knife, but after getting no response decided to use CS gas. 'This had no effect upon him and without warning the defendant rushed back into the kitchen from where he had come,' Mr Glasgow told the court. 'The officers were powerless to stop him as he plunged the knife into the victim’s neck.' Ms Larner suffered a total of 17 stab wounds all over her body of 9cm to 10cm in depth. The fatal blow went through the left side of her chest, her left lung and the thoracic aorta. Asked afterwards by officers at Acton police station why he had carried out the attack, Parker said: 'I just lost the plot, I don’t know what it was.' The court heard that he had a previous conviction for GBH with intent after attacking a man with a knife in 1990, in addition to other violent and drug-related offences. At the time of the attack he was suffering an 'acute psychotic episode' and had been smoking cannabis, the court heard. He has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and depression and had previously reported hearing voices in his head. Setencing him to remain in hospital until experts determine he has made a full recovery, judge Timothy Pontius said: 'It is undoubtedly necessary for the protection of the public from serious harm at your hands that such an order should be made.'","Larry Parker, 54, repeatedly plunged an 18-inch kitchen knife into his long-term partner Lesley Larner .

The mother of twin 15-year-old heirs to the Doris Duke fortune is accused of scheming with her convicted child molester boyfriend to drain her children's $60million trust fund. JP Morgan, the administrator of the money, filed court documents on April 8 alleging that Randy Williams, 49, used the children's mother's email to ask for cash from the trust fund. He may also be behind unusual requests for money to pay for gold coins and a vacation to Las Vegas. Daisha Inman, the mother of teens Georgia and Walker Inman, has been battling the administrator of her children's trust fund for years. She says JP Morgan is refusing to pay basic expenses - including the teens' private schooling. But in court filings, JP Morgan says Mrs Inman has become 'erratic and hostile' and is making increasingly 'suspicious' requests to withdraw money from the fund, according to DNAInfo.com. 'Danger': The trust fund manager raised concerns about the twin's mother rekindling her relationship with Randy Williams, who has been accused of sexually abusing children . The broke millionaires: Walker Inman III and twin sister Georgia Inman, 15, have trust funds worth an estimated $60million - but they can't access the money until they turn 21 . Legal battle: Daisha Inman, the mother of the twins, has been fighting for the administrator of her children's trust to release more money. She is seen here after a 2012 arrest for public drunkenness in South Carolina . Glamorous: Doris Duke, a New York socialite who died in 1993, was known as the 'richest girl in the world' for her trust funds left to her by her father, who founded American Tobacco . They say Inman, 54, has gotten back together with Williams, her ex-husband, despite his convictions for sexually abusing minors. Williams has been convicted of . molesting his step-daughters from a previous marriage and was barred . from seeing his son after a court in Washington state found that he had . sexually abused and neglected the child, according to Manhattan court . filings by the JPMorgan administrator. 'At the most basic level, (JPMorgan) is concerned about the potential risks to the children,' the trust . administrator wrote, according to the New York Post. Diasha and Williams agreed to split . the 3percent commission that Williams would earn as the real estate . broker for the sale, according to court documents. As a result, the trust fund overseers went so far as to withhold the children's Christmas money. 'Concerned about Randy Williams' proximity to the children, his potential involvement in the children's . financial affairs, and petitioner's continued difficulties with Ms. Inman - including Ms. Inman's failure to account for funds advanced to . her - we determined in December 2012 that it would not transfer . significant funds that had been approved for housing and holiday . expenses to Ms. Inman's own bank account as it had done in the past,' the administrator wrote. Squabbles: The children's mother Daisha (left) was the fourth wife of Walker 'Skipper' Inman Jr (right), who died in 2010 of a methadone overdose . Family tree: Walker and Georgia Inman are the great-niece and nephew of Doris Duke . 'Daddy Warbucks': All of the money in the Duke and Inman fortunes came from the millions James 'Buck' Duke, the founder of American Tobacco . Instead, the bank set up separate funds that the children could access. Georgia Noel Lahi Inman and Walker . Patterson Inman III are the great-step-niece and nephew of tobacco . heiress Doris Duke, once described as 'the richest girl in the world.' Their father, Walker Inman Jr, who . died in 2010 of a drug overdose, married Daisha, a former topless . dancer, as his fourth wife, the Post reports. The children can't access the Doris Duke inheritance, estimated at $60million, until they are 21. The administrator claims Williams selected the the $4.3million South Carolina mansion that . Daisha asked the administrator to purchase. He chose the home, because . 'it was described in local media as the most expensive home on the Isle . of Palm,' according to documents. It was revealed last month that . Daisha tried to buy a $29million mansion in Park City, Utah, with the . trust fund - which would have depleted nearly half of her children's . money. 'Instead of locating a suitable . rental property as she had represented she would do, Ms. Inman requested . funding to buy a ranch in Utah with a listing price of $29million . (representing almost the entirety of the property held in the children’s . trusts,' Francis Simms, a JPMorgan executor for the fund, wrote in a . new court filing. The 214-acre ranch boasted eight bedrooms, nine bathrooms, a tennis court, a movie theater and other luxury amenities. 'Shortly before she moved to Utah, . Ms Inman made another premature request to fund the purchase of a . relatively more modest $4.3million South Carolina residence, only to . leave South Carolina without warning a few months later,' Simms wrote. Inman blames JPMorgan for her . family's financial difficulties, claiming their reluctance to repay . legitimate expenses has resulted in the children being suspended from . their private school. She has not commented on the latest claims about . the Utah ranch. Glamor: Doris Duke lived her entire adult life as the subject of news and gossip pages. Her wealth, philanthropy and multiple marriages made her one of the most famous women of her day . Socialite: Duke, seen here with Andy Warhol at Studio 54 in 1977, rubbed elbows with all of New York's most famous people until her death in 1993 . Simms said the tuition wasn't paid . because Inman failed to provide an itemized invoice verifying that the . amount she asked for in tuition in fees was actually the amount that . was owed, according to the New York Post. Ms Inman said she wanted to give her . children a horse, a snowmobile and an around-the-world trip. The trust . paid out $5,000 for Christmas instead. 'If the trustees simply funded all . requests it received, the children’s trusts could be drained of assets . long before the children ever reach the age of 21 years,' JPMorgan . wrote. But Ms Inman says the says the trustees have gone too far and neglected to pay her children's legitimate expenses. The trustees have asked the court to intervene in the battle over twins' money. Home: Doris Duke moved bounced around several lavish homes, including this mansion in Honolulu, Hawaii. She also owned a 2,700-acre farm in New Jersey and a mansion on East 78th Street in Manhattan . Much like her descendants, Duke was unlucky in love. She is pictured here in 1935 with financier James Cromwell, the first of her two husbands .

A huge blaze 'irreversibly' damaged a Parisian 17th century palace yesterday that once hosted to the likes of Voltaire and Chopin. A large portion of Hotel Lambert's roof was burned away in the blaze just as a costly renovation was near completion. The Qatari-owned mansion, which once belonged to the Rothschild dynasty, on the Ile Saint-Louis island on the River Seine was one of the most well-preserved private mansions in Paris. France's culture minister said the 'fire caused very grave damage to an essential part of Paris's heritage' It took more than six hours to control the blaze at the 17th century Hotel Lambert in Paris on Wednesday . Most of the historic Hotel Lambert's roof was destroyed in the blaze on Wednesday . The Qatari owned mansion was undergoing a controversial renovation when the fire started, which Paris politicians say is 'irreversible' Its architect Louis Le Vau also designed the Palace of Versailles. Paris Mayor Bernard Delanoe said: 'This is a setback for our historical heritage.' Culture minister Aurelie Filippetti said: 'The fire has caused very grave damage to an essential part of Paris's heritage, some of which is irreversible', according to The Daily Telegraph. More than 170 firefighters were called to the Unesco-listed building at around 1am and struggled to contain the blaze for six hours. Televised images showed billowing grey . smoke pouring out of the building's roof while helmeted firemen . clambered across balconies trying to extinguish the blaze. It is not yet known whether the mansion's precious murals by Charles Le Brun, who also designed the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles, were damaged. The fire broke out in a hard-to-access area below the rooftop and 650 square metres of the roof was burned away. More than 170 firefighters tackled the blaze that started at about 1am and took six hours to extinguish . Firefighters have yet to ascertain the cause of the fire that started in a hard to access area under the roof . It quickly spread through the empty house. Part of a central staircase and some façade masonry had also collapsed and rooms were damaged by water and smoke, fire brigade spokesman Pascal Le Testu said. Art historians were evaluating the damage to works of art, which firefighters had tried to protect, Le Testu said. They managed to prevent the blaze from spreading to surrounding buildings, which were evacuated as a precaution. The damage came as workers were putting final touches to a renovation agreed between Paris authorities and the owner, a brother of Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, the former emir of Qatar. The Hotel Lambert on Ile de Saint Louis was bought for about 80million euros in 2007 . Chopin, right, and Voltaire, left, were once guests at the historic mansion . Plans to renovate the mansion were only finalised after a lengthy legal battle between al-Thani, who bought it in 2007 for a price that media estimated was up to €80million, and groups defending Paris monuments. Opponents to the original renovation scheme objected to plans to build an underground garage, install an elevator and new bathrooms as well as redesigning its garden. Built in the 1640s, the mansion was used 100 years later by writer and philosopher Voltaire. The mansion was occupied for 150 years by the Polish Czartoryski family, who hosted the likes of Chopin, before it was sold it the French branch of the Rothschild family in 1975.","A large portion of 17th century Hotel Lambert's roof burned away in blaze .

The decision taps a Bush-era Justice Department official to lead the agency as it grapples with privacy debates over a host of recently exposed investigative tactics. Obama praised Comey for demonstrating unyielding integrity in the face of uncertainty. Flanked by Comey and his outgoing FBI director, Robert Mueller, in a sunny White House Rose Garden announcement, Obama said Comey recognizes that in times of crisis, America is judged not only by how many plots are disrupted, but also by its commitment to civil liberties and the ideals espoused in the Constitution. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama, followed by outgoing FBI Director Robert Mueller, right, and his choice to succeed Mueller, James Comey, left, at the White House . 'Jim understands, deeply in his core, the anguish of victims of crime - what they go through,' Obama said. 'He's made it his life's work to spare others that pain.' 'He's a rarity in Washington sometimes: He doesn't care about politics,' Obama added. Comey is perhaps best-known for a remarkable 2004 standoff at the hospital bedside of Attorney General John Ashcroft over a no-warrant wiretapping program. Comey rushed to the room of his bedridden boss to physically stop White House officials from trying to get an ailing Ashcroft to reauthorize the program. If confirmed by the Senate, Comey would serve a 10-year term and replace Mueller, who has held the job since the week before the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. Obama praised Mueller effusively and said he could declare without equivocation that countless Americans are alive today because of Mueller's efforts. Mueller is set to resign on Sept. 4 after overseeing the bureau's transformation into one the country's chief weapons against terrorism. Obama praised Comey, pictured left, for demonstrating unyielding integrity in the face of uncertainty during his White House announcement . 'I must be out of my mind to be following Bob Mueller,' Comey said. 'I don't know whether I can fill those shoes, but I know that however I do, I will be truly standing on the shoulders of a giant.' Comey was a federal prosecutor who served for several years as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York before coming to Washington after the Sept. 11 attacks as deputy attorney general. In recent years, he's been an executive at defense company Lockheed Martin, general counsel to a hedge fund, board member at HSBC Holdings and lecturer on national security law at Columbia Law School. The White House may hope that Comey's Republican background and strong credentials will help him through Senate confirmation at a time when some of Obama's nominees have been facing tough battles. Republicans have said they see no major obstacles to his confirmation, although he is certain to face tough questions about his hedge fund work and his ties to Wall Street as well as how he would handle current, high-profile FBI investigations. The FBI is responsible for both intelligence and law enforcement with more than 36,000 employees. It has faced questions in recent weeks over media leak probes involving The Associated Press and Fox News; the Boston Marathon bombings; the attack at Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans; and two vast government surveillance programs into phone records and online communications. The leaker of those National Security Agency programs, former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, also is the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation. FBI Director Robert Mueller, center, shakes hands with James Comey, center, as President Barack Obama, right, looks on in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington . And just this week, Mueller revealed the FBI uses drones for surveillance of stationary subjects and said the privacy implications of such operations are worthy of debate. 'This work of striking a balance between our security but also making sure we're maintaining fidelity to those values that we cherish is a constant mission,' Obama said. Comey played a central role in holding up Bush's warrantless wiretapping program, one of the administration's great controversies and an episode that focused attention on the administration's controversial tactics in the war on terror. In dramatic testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2007, Comey said he thought the no-warrant wiretapping program was so questionable that he refused to reauthorize it while serving as acting attorney general during Ashcroft's hospitalization. Comey said when he learned that the White House chief of staff Andrew Card and counsel Alberto Gonzales were heading to Ashcroft's room, despite Ashcroft's wife's instructions that there be no visitors, Comey beat them there and watched as Ashcroft turned them away. 'That night was probably the most difficult night of my professional life,' Comey testified. He said he and Ashcroft had reservations about the program's legality, but he would not discuss details since the program was classified. U.S. President Barack Obama shakes hands with outgoing FBI Director Robert Mueller . Senior government officials had expressed concerns about whether the NSA, which administered the warrantless eavesdropping program, had the proper oversight in place. Other concerns included whether any president possessed the legal and constitutional authority to authorize the program as it was carried out at the time. Comey was deputy attorney general in 2005 when he unsuccessfully tried to limit tough interrogation tactics against suspected terrorists. He told then-Attorney General Gonzales that some of the practices were wrong and would damage the department's reputation. Some Democrats denounced those methods as torture, particularly the use of waterboarding, which produces the sensation of drowning. Comey's defiance won him praise from Democrats. In a statement, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who will oversee Comey's confirmation hearing, said, 'Mr. Comey showed the kind of independence needed to lead the FBI when he stood up to those in the last administration who sought to violate the rule of law.' Leahy called for senators to give Comey 'the swift and respectful confirmation he deserves.' Sen. Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Comey's experience on national security would benefit the FBI. 'Jim Comey (pictured left) understands, deeply in his core, the anguish of victims of crime - what they go through', Obama said . 'He's previously dealt with these matters with integrity and shown a willingness to stand his ground if necessary,' Grassley said in a statement. He added that he wants to question Comey on his work in the hedge fund industry and wonders whether he could improve the Obama administration's efforts to prosecute Wall Street for its role in the economic downturn. Concerns over Comey were raised by the American Civil Liberties Union, which doesn't take positions on nominees but is interested in civil liberties issues. ACLU senior policy counsel Mike German said while Comey stood up to some surveillance, he eventually approved the NSA program along with interrogation techniques that included waterboarding, as well as defended the indefinite detention of Jose Padilla, an American terrorism suspect. 'We want to make sure whoever sits in that chair has a determined interest in protecting the rule of law, particularly since they will be there 10 years, outlasting this president and potentially the next president,' German said. James Comey, a senior Justice Department official under President George W. Bush, speaks in the Rose Garden of the White House . German said these issues are particularly relevant given new revelations about surveillance programs. As U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, Comey headed one of the nation's most prominent prosecutorial offices and one at the front lines in the fight against terrorism, corporate malfeasance, organized crime and the war on drugs. As an assistant U.S. attorney in Virginia, Comey handled the investigation of the 1996 bombing of the Khobar Towers housing complex near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, which killed 19 U.S. military personnel. He led the Justice Department's corporate fraud task force and spurred the creation of violent crime impact teams in 20 cities, focusing on crimes committed with guns. After leaving government in 2005, Comey was senior vice president and general counsel at Lockheed Martin. In 2010, he went to the Westport, Conn.-based hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, before leaving in February. The White House also said Comey has developed improvements in the military justice system's performance regarding crimes committed in Iraq and Afghanistan as a member of the Defense Legal Policy Board, which provides independent advice to the defense secretary. Comey also has taught at the University of Richmond Law School and worked for law firm McGuireWoods LLP, also in Richmond. He has a bachelor's degree from the College of William & Mary, a law degree from the University of Chicago Law School and clerked for former District Court Judge John M. Walker, Jr. in the Southern District of New York.","James Comey will take over from the outgoing FBI director Robert Mueller .

An investigation has revealed that just four out of 211 GP-run Clinical Commissioning Groups are funding IVF treatment . The advice sparked controversy as treatment costs £4,000 a time and research shows only about 17 per cent women of this age fall pregnant, and about half of those suffer miscarriages. The British Medical Journal used Freedom of Information requests to reveal that the majority of organisations ignore the advice. It also showed that many of the newly-created CCGs are rationing treatments to save money. In NHS Mid Essex, hernias are only treated if they are growing every month or are very painful. In February the health watchdog NICE said IVF must be available to all women aged 40 to 42 ¿ as well as lesbian couples.

Pensions Minister Steve Webb said younger people will have the advantages of knowing they will get a simple, clear state pension . The under-30s will be forced to spend their careers saving up for retirement because their state pensions will be far lower than expected, experts warn today. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, which examined Government plans for a flat-rate pension to replace the current system, says ministers must spell out the difference so people can save into work or private schemes. From April 2016, all pensioners who have worked for a minimum of 35 years will be entitled to £146 a week, compared with the current £100.15-a-week basic state pension and means-tested add-ons. As well as making pensions simpler and cheaper, ministers say most of those retiring in coming years will be better off under the new system, particularly low earners. In a report, the IFS agrees that of people reaching pension age between 2016 and 2020, 61 per cent will get more under the new rules, and 17 per cent the same amount as now. But in the long run, those born after the mid-1980s will see a significant reduction in state pension income ‘for almost everyone’ of up to £2,300 a year. It calls on the Government to make it clear to young people that they will need to build up their own savings if they want the level of retirement pay their parents receive. The new ‘single-tier’ pension scheme cuts the link between pensions and earnings. The winners will be women who have taken time off work to have children, who stand to gain £9 a week; low earners, who will gain £3.97 a week, and the self-employed. Losing out are mostly higher earners. The IFS said the reforms will reduce the cost of the pension system as a whole and help the public finances cope with an ageing population. But the authors say younger people, almost all of those born after 1986 and many born after 1966, will be far worse off when they retire in real terms. Someone born in 1986 who spends 35 years as a low earner would receive nearly £1,000 per year less under the proposed new system than under the current system. In the long run, those born after the mid-1980s will see a significant reduction in state pension income ¿for almost everyone¿ . A higher earner of the same age could lose £2,300 a year, the IFS says. Gemma Tetlow, one of the report’s authors, said: ‘People born from the mid-Eighties onwards will certainly be negatively affected. ‘This is essentially because £146 a week in today’s money increasing in line with wages is below what most young people today will expect to earn, unless they are very long-term self-employed. The messaging around these reforms should be making that clear. ‘On the upside, the flat rate is much clearer so they will know exactly how much they will get from the state and plan around it. But they will need to save privately to earn as much as under the current scheme.’ Pensions Minister Steve Webb said: ‘The majority of individuals approaching retirement will see a higher state pension. 'Younger people will have the advantages of knowing they will get a simple, clear state pension, and when they are employed have the right to an occupational pension on top.’","The Institute for Fiscal Studies says ministers must spell out the difference so people can save into work or private schemes .

Battling out of his seat, Benjamin Levy's ribs hurt so much he thought they were broken, but what struck him most about seconds after Asiana Flight 214 came to a shuddering halt on the tarmac of San Francisco airport was the silence. None of the flight attendants could be found directing the 291 injured and terrified passengers off the stricken Boeing 777, no one from the cockpit announced anything - and now previously unseen pictures taken by Levy in the confused aftermath have been released by the Associated Press. Ignoring his pain, Levy, 39, rushed to the escape door by his seat above one of the battered wings and opened it and he began to direct the evacuation of the aircraft which just moments before had crash landed - losing its entire tail section. Escape: In this Saturday, July 6, 2013, photo provided by passenger Benjamin Levy, passengers from Asiana Airlines flight 214, many with their luggage, wait on the tarmac just moments after the plane crashed at San Francisco International Airport . 'We were left on our own,' said Mr. Levy to the New York Times. 'There was no message from the pilot, from the crew - there was no one.' Levy ushered up to 40 passengers out of the escape door, despite the fact that the emergency sliding chute had not deployed on his side of the plane. The wheels of the aircraft had been snapped off as the plane hit a seawall on its approach - making it easy for those able to help themselves to lower down onto the tarmac of the runway. Deciding not to exit the Boeing 777 through that exit, Levy, who as an international businessman is a frequent flyer, moved to the back of the plane where a gaping hole now existed where the tail section used to be. Survivor: Ben Levy speaks about being aboard Asiana Flight 214, which crashed on Saturday, July 6th, 2013, at San Francisco International Airport, during an interview at his office in San Francisco, on Tuesday, July 9th, 2013 . Ben Levy, (right), poses for photographs with his wife Sumi Lee Levy, as he wears a yellow ribbon put on by a firefighter on the tarmac for triage after Asiana Flight 214 crashed on Saturday . He moved past luggage which had rained down on seats and he saw a woman whose leg was trapped by a seat - forced loose of its rivets as the plane almost barreled over as it came to a jarring halt. 'She couldn't move,' said Levy to the New York Times. 'There were two other guys. We couldn't pick her up.' A firefighter who had rushed onto the plane without thought for his safety appeared and ordered Levy and the last remaining passengers who could walk off the plane, which had now burst into flames. 'People were pushing each other out. There was a lot of commotion. We got pretty much everyone in the back section of the plane out. I'm so thankful so many people go out of the plane quickly.' Having landed at San Francisco many times before, Levy told NBC Bay Area that he knew the approach was wrong. Fiery Wreck: The flight crashed upon landing, and two of the 291 passengers aboard were killed . Collecting Their Thoughts: The passengers of Asiana Flight 214 hug each other after having survived the terrifying crash on Saturday . As has transpired, this was pilot Lee Kang-kooks first landing at San Francisco in a Boeing 777 and in total he had logged only 43 hours flying time in the aircraft, despite being an experienced Boeing 747 pilot. 'When he realized that, he put more gas to try to correct the plane again and it was too late,' Levy recalled in a phone interview with NBC Bay Area. 'So we hit the runway pretty bad and then we starting going back up in the air again. And then we landed again pretty hard. 'It felt like the guy missed the runway quite completely. He tried to correct, which probably helped. We would have hit the rocks.' As the plane's belly skidded along the runway, Levy described the sheer terror inside. 'It was surreal,' Levy said. 'A lot of people screaming and not really believing what was happening to them. I wasn’t believing it either.' Taken to San Francisco General Hospital, Levy was treated for cuts and bruises and later reunited with his family. 'I am in pain, but not too bad compared to other people,' he said, adding on Twitter of his actions, 'Just did what anyone in my position would have done.' Help: In this Saturday, July 6, 2013, photo provided by passenger Benjamin Levy, passengers from Asiana Airlines flight 214 are treated by first responders on the tarmac just moments after the plane crashed at the San Francisco International Airport . Despite Levy's assertion that the crew were nowhere to be found, the bravery of cabin manager Lee Yoon-hye, the last person to leave the burning plane has been praised. Another flight attendant put a scared elementary schoolboy on her back and slid down a slide and one of the four pilots helped another injured flight attendant off the plane after the passengers escaped. Lee herself worked to put out fires and usher passengers to safety, despite suffering a broken tailbone that she didn't know she had until she was finally treated at San Francisco hospital later. While it is a miracle that 305 of the 307 passengers and crew of Asiana Flight 214 survived, it is 'most likely' that one of the the two Chinese teens who died were hit by an emergency vehicle rushing to the burning plane. While a fire department spokeswoman said this on Monday, authorities are not saying if it was Ye Meng Yuan and Wang Linjia, both 16, who suffered the tragic accident. Head Count: The survivors of Asiana Flight 214 gather together on the tarmac of San Francisco International Airport after evacuating the Boeing 777 which crashed on landing on Saturday . 'The incident commander was notified by one of the chiefs on the field that it appeared that there was a possibility that one of the deceased had been hit by one of the fire vehicles,' Mindy Talmadge, a spokeswoman for the San Francisco Fire Department, said yesterday in an interview with Bloomberg. 'Most likely it was a fire vehicle, but everything is still kind of up in the air until the investigation is complete.' And it has been revealed today that six of the 29 students on the flight who were headed to California as part of a summer camp are now stuck in limbo as their passports were destroyed in the crash. Indeed, the tour organizer, Adam Yu believes that the entire camp will be scrapped and the children will return to China in the next few days. 'The students and parents are missing each other,' he said to the Daily Beast. 'They need a few days to recover. They’re very emotional. It’s best for them to take a few days’ rest before sending them on an airplane again. It would be scary for them. 'They were shocked. They’re afraid to take an airplane right away.'","Previously unseen pictures taken .

Female MPs who complain about how macho politics are not the victims of sexism but simply ‘useless’, Ann Widdecombe has claimed. The outspoken former Tory minister dismissed the idea that Westminster was biased against women, and insisted both sexes were ‘roughed up’ during debates. In remarks likely divide opinion in Parliament, Miss Widdecombe said women must not go into politics with a ‘sense of grievance’. Outspoken: Former Tory minister Ann Widdecombe warned female MPs not to enter politics with a 'sense of grievance' Miss Widdecombe, who was prisons minister in John Major’s last government, insisted those women who do choose a career in politics had to prove their commitment, and realise having a family might not be conducive to the rough and tumble of life in Westminster. She lashed out against the 101 female New Labour MPs swept into Parliament by Tony Blair;s landslide election in 1997. Miss Widdecombe said too many of them thought they were treated rudely by opponents because they were women – when I fact they just were not very good. Babes: Many of the women swept into Parliament by Tony Blair's first New Labour landslide in 1997 were not up to the job, Miss Widdecombe suggested . Useless: The 101 female Labour MPs 'might as well have been the 101 Dalmations' She said: ‘I vividly remember that about six months after the Blair Babes came in – you may remember them? 101 of them came in and I always thought they might as well have had the 101 Dalmations. ‘About sixth months afterwards, one of them came up to me in the corridor and she said to me: “Ann, isn’t it horrible how the men are so rude to us?” ‘And I said “yes, and isn’t it horrible how they are so rude to each other?” And she hadn’t thought of that. ‘She had just been roughed up in the chamber, she had assumed it was because she was a woman. In fact it was because she was useless,’ she said speaking at the Telegraph Ways With Words festival. A frequent critic of David Cameron’s leadership of the Tory party, Miss Widdecombe criticised the use of A-lists and ‘positive discrimination’ when selecting candidates to fight elections. Rough: Miss Widdecombe, pictured at the despatch box in 2000, said female MPs failed to realise that in politics everyone was rude to each other . Commitment: Miss Widdecombe has said she would like to have been a mother, but that would not have been compatible with running for Parliament . When she was selected in the 1980s ‘it did take quite a long time for everybody, male and female, to get into Westminster’. Travelling around the country in search of a seat was a test of commitment and ability, she said. 'Supposing you had a family: If you were doing what I had to do - which was to go up to the north every week to the constituency for 18 months - it would be quite a difficult commitment to make. So it would be quite a serious test.' She added: ‘I do urge women who are interested in going into politics not to enter it with this tremendous sense of grievance. ‘I went to Westminster to thinking of myself as a women MP at all, but an MP who happened to be a woman. I expected to be treated the same as the men and I was.’ Last month she revealed her desire to have had children – but insisted it would have made becoming an MP impossible. ‘I’d have liked to have been a full-time mother, although I say that with the wisdom of hindsight,’ she told the Mail on Sunday. ‘I certainly wouldn’t have gone into politics. It’s not the hours, but the geographical distance – Mum doesn’t come home till midnight – I would not have done that.’","Former Tory minister insists rudeness is part of life in Parliament .

Footballer Carlos Tevez has avoided completing a  250-hour community service order by paying a £3,000 fine – the equivalent of half an hour of his wages. The multi-millionaire’s  lawyers argued that he could not complete the work after transferring from Premier League club Manchester City to Juventus in Italy. Tevez had completed just 28 hours of his punishment – imposed after being convicted of a string of driving offences earlier this year. Avoided: Former Manchester City striker Carlos Tevez has had his community service rescinded in favour of a £3,000 fine - a sum he earns in just 37 minutes on his £196,000 a week salary . Yesterday a district judge sitting at Macclesfield magistrates’ court fined Tevez a derisory £3,000 – in place of finishing his punishment. The fine is a drop in the ocean for the Argentinian striker, who reportedly earned £250,000 a week at Manchester City. Based on a 40-hour week, he collected £6,250 an hour – meaning the fine is the equivalent of just 30 minutes’ ‘work’. Last night criminologist Dr David Green said: ‘The punishment he is receiving is certainly not proportionate to his crimes. ‘And this certainly does not send the right message as the fine is just a tiny fraction of what he earns. ‘This judge has simply failed in her duty to the justice system.’ A spokesman for Families Against Crime added: ‘Let’s not beat about the bush, Carlos Tevez was guilty of repeated driving offences and rode roughshod over the  British justice system. Into Italy: The Argentinian signed for Juventus two weeks ago. His career at Manchester City was tempestuous . ‘By flouting a driving ban and then essentially escaping justice with a measly fine the courts have shown themselves to be complete pushovers. ‘The level of the fine is a disgrace  and sends out completely the wrong message to other drivers. ‘Maybe the next offender will seek to have his community order lifted and offer a fraction of his weekly wage. What a shambles.’ Tevez, 29, was not in court. His lawyers were told he would face the £5,000 maximum fine for his offence – but with a £2,000 ‘reduction’ for his guilty plea and the 28 hours’ work he completed. Tevez leaving Macclesfield Magistrates Court in April after he was ordered to carry out 250 hours of community service . Tevez was disqualified from driving for six months and handed community service in April after he admitted driving while disqualified and without insurance. The court heard he had completed 28 hours of the order at Macclesfield’s Community Garden Centre, where he helped adults with learning difficulties. Gwyn Lewis, defending, said the order became unworkable when the player was sold to a foreign club, adding: ‘Events overtook  his control and he was sold  to Juventus.’ A community service order involves unpaid work in the community or attendance at a centre to undertake a course, such as anger management. Breaches can see the orders being revoked and more severe penalties imposed. Yesterday Judge Bridget Knight accepted the circumstances were beyond Tevez’s control, adding: ‘This is only a technical breach. It is not, I repeat not, a case of a footballer thumbing his nose at a court order.’ It is thought Tevez’s legal team argued that because he was sold by Manchester City, he was not responsible in law for his inability to comply with the order. In a statement, Tevez said: ‘I would like to thank the court for its understanding.’","The former Man City striker was given 250 hours unpaid work in April .

Tory MP Richard Bacon said a ‘super-stratum’ of senior managers had been ‘gouging the licence fee payer’.

And on a humiliating day, the BBC’s . director of human resources, Lucy Adams – who signed off contentious . deals to get staff ‘out of the door’ – was accused of presiding over . ‘corporate fraud and cronyism’. Lord Hall was grilled by the public . accounts committee over the findings of last week’s devastating report . by the public spending watchdog into lucrative severance payments. The National Audit Office found that . the BBC handed out £369million over eight years, in many cases paying . staff hundreds of thousands of pounds more than they were contractually . owed and in some instances even paying them twice. The BBC Trust’s chairman Lord Patten . was also quizzed by MPs, who accused the governing body of ‘failing to . meet its obligations’ by cracking down on severance payments years ago. He admitted the Audit Office report had caused him ‘shock and dismay’ but said there would be ‘no legal effort’ to force staff to repay the . money. Tony Hall (second from right with back facing camera) made the dramatic confession to MPs . Yesterday a former BBC governor for . Wales said chairman Lord Patten should stand down over the debacle. Sir . Roger Jones said: ‘I don’t think he’s done a good job, there have been . several serious questions about his judgment.’ In a dramatic day: . In an extraordinary exchange with MPs, . Lord Hall – who started as director general in April – admitted the BBC . overpaid its staff and should accept the ‘onus of responsibility’. He . added: ‘Culturally . . .

'I think one . of the issues was there was not enough grip at the centre of the . organisation, by the non-execs, by the executives.’ According to the Audit Office, the top . ten severance payments – to figures including former deputy director . general Mark Byford and marketing chief Sharon Baylay – accounted for 20 . per cent of the BBC’s total spend. Mr Bacon said: ‘This culture appears . to be one of mates, cronyism, slapping each other on the shoulder, . arranging for huge payoffs – “snouts in the trough are us”, basically. ‘Most BBC employees are not like this. They work very hard and they don’t get big amounts of money. ‘There’s this little super-stratum at . the top . . . they are a small number of people who have been gouging . the licence fee payer for quite a long time, and it’s a very big . problem.’ Out: Payments to ten top managers, including former director general George Entwistle (pictured) and chief operating officer Caroline Thomson, totalled £4.9million . Mr Fry, who chairs the BBC Trust’s . finance committee, insisted he had ‘no power to intervene’ in the issue . under the rules of the BBC charter. But the committee’s chairman, Labour . MP Margaret Hodge, said: ‘I think, with the deepest regret, Mr Fry, you . failed. You failed.’ It emerged the BBC Trust had been told . about two of the biggest payments, to Mr Byford (£949,000) and Mrs . Baylay (£394,638), in a letter from Mr Thompson on October 7, 2010. Lord . Patten insisted the Trust was not informed the payments were far in . excess of what the duo were entitled to, adding: ‘If you call in due . course the previous director general of the BBC, I will be as interested . as you are in finding out why we didn’t know.’ Mr Fry also appeared to lay the blame . at the door of Mr Thompson, who left to become chief executive of the .

Asked whether Mr Thompson had lied to . him, he said: ‘All I can say is on the basis of the information provided . in the letter to the Trust on October 7, and the terms of that letter, . and what emerged subsequently, there is some disconnect.’ Mr Fry said he had ‘particularly . unpleasant discussions’ with members of the BBC executive when the . payments were made, adding: ‘I thought they were completely out to lunch . in regards to what they thought was acceptable pay in a public body.’ Despite pressure from MPs to recoup . some of the money handed out to staff, Lord Patten said lawyers had . advised him it would be ‘impossible to claw it back’. Miss Adams, who signed off Mr Byford’s . deal, said she felt ‘uncomfortable’ with the generous sums, but added: . ‘I just wanted to get him out of the door.’ Accusing her of ‘spouting HR . flim-flam’, Tory MP Stewart Jackson said: ‘This is corporate fraud and . cronyism that you presided over.’","MPs claim BBC Trust failed in duty to ensure value for money .

The mother of Stephen Lawrence has said 20 years of scandals since the teenager's racist murder has left her with ‘no confidence’ in police. Doreen Lawrence said she does not ‘know what to believe any more’ after allegations emerged that senior officers tried to smear her family. She said only a full public inquiry can get to the bottom of the activities of undercover officers in the months after her son’s killing. No confidence in officers: Doreen Lawrence, the mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence, appearing before the Home Affairs Select Committee in the wake of claims police tried to smear her family . One former Met undercover officer provoked outrage last month when he claimed commanders wanted ‘dirt’ on the Lawrence family. Speaking to MPs: Mrs Lawrence arrives at the select committee hearing at Portcullis House in central London . Speaking to the Home Affairs Committee, Mrs Lawrence said she remains deeply shocked at the latest damaging allegations. Asked if she has confidence in . police, she replied: ‘I have no confidence whatsoever. Over the years I . was beginning to develop a level of trust. ‘Because of the investigation, the . court case and then we had the convictions of two suspects. I was . beginning to develop some confidence. ‘Now I just don’t know what to believe anymore.’ Two investigations are now examining . claims undercover officers infiltrated protest groups that gathered . around the Lawrence family. Former officer Peter Francis claimed . attempts were made to discover information that could smear Stephen’s . family after his racist murder in April 1993. One inquiry is being led by top QC . Mark Ellison, who led the successful prosecution of Gary Dobson and . David Norris in January last year. The Home Secretary instructed the barrister to examine whether police corruption undermined the original inquiry. A second investigation, Operation . Herne, is probing the conduct of police spies generally, with an urgent . emphasis on the Lawrence family claims. Mrs Lawrence told MPs that she felt let down by police and the independent police watchdog and wanted a public inquiry. Hearing: Mrs Lawrence said yesterday that it was not right for 'police officers to investigate each other' She said Met Commissioner Sir Bernard . Hogan-Howe has said ‘all the right words’ to her but said she is . waiting to see it ‘come to fruition’. Death: Stephen was 18 when he was attacked by five white youths as he waited for a bus in Eltham, south-east London, on April 22, 1993 . Speaking about the inquiries, she . said an ‘open and transparent’ public inquiry must take place instead of . reviews ‘behind closed doors’. She said: ‘You can’t have police officers investigating each other. It’s proven that’s not the right way to do things.’ Mrs Lawrence said she believed her . family was targeted by police because many officers had not met a black . family which was not made up of criminals before. She said: ‘At the time it was probably because we were too outspoken and we were questioning how the investigation was run. ‘We were told on a couple of occasions that they had never met any family like us before.’ Mr Ellison defended the apparently slow progress of his review which has already cost taxpayers £190,000 in just seven months. His team has more than 100 crates of material to examine, and he said they are about half-way through the task. The QC said he will refer his . findings to police if he uncovers evidence of criminal conduct and he . hopes to release an ‘interim’ report by Christmas. Repeatedly asked whether a public . inquiry should take place, Mr Ellison said there is ‘strong validity’ for one but also several drawbacks. He said a public inquiry would be . slow and cumbersome and witnesses may have to be offered immunity from . prosecution if they give evidence.","Doreen Lawrence says police officers should not 'investigate each other'

Older people who carry out at least 200 hours of voluntary work a year reduce their risk of high blood pressure by 40 per cent . Volunteering for the WI or helping out at a charity shop could save your life by reducing your blood pressure, according to new research. Older people who carry out at least 200 hours of voluntary work a year  - which equates to 25 days of eight hours - reduce their risk of high blood pressure by 40 per cent. The condition, known medically as hypertension, is one of the main causes of stroke and heart disease - Britain’s biggest killer. A study last week found about a quarter of over 60s in the UK regularly help the Women’s Institute, the Scouts and other such organisations, more than any other age group. The researchers believe the reason these activities improve blood pressure could be that people who devote their time to others enjoy more friendships and social connections than they would otherwise. Professor Sheldon Sneed, of Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, said: ‘As people get older, social transitions like retirement, bereavement and the departure of children from the home often leave older adults with fewer natural opportunities for social interaction. ‘Participating in volunteer activities may provide older adults with social connections they might not have otherwise. There is strong evidence that having good social connections promotes healthy ageing and reduces risk for a number of negative health outcomes.’ The study, published by the American Psychological Association’s Psychology and Aging journal, says voluntary work may be an effective way of preventing high blood pressure without the use of drugs. Every year high blood pressure leads to more than seven million premature deaths across the globe through heart disease and stroke. In the UK there are estimated to be about 62,000 unnecessary deaths a year from stroke and heart problems because of poor blood pressure control. For the study 1,164 participants aged 51 to 91 from across the US were recruited and asked about any voluntary work, as well as various social and psychological factors. At the first interview in 2006 all had normal blood pressure levels but when measured again in 2010, those who had been doing 200 hours or more a year for charity were 40 per cent less likely to have developed hypertension. The condition, known medically as hypertension, is one of the main causes of stroke and heart disease - Britain's biggest killer . The researchers said the specific type of activity was not a factor the important thing was the amount of time spent. Psychologist Rodlescia Sneed, who led the research, said: ‘Everyday, we are learning more about how negative lifestyle factors like poor diet and lack of exercise increase hypertension risk. ‘Here, we wanted to determine if a positive lifestyle factor like volunteer work could actually reduce disease risk. ‘And, the results give older adults an example of something that they can actively do to remain healthy and age successfully.’","High blood pressure is one of the main causes of stroke and heart disease .

Facebook will offer real money betting on horse racing and football matches in a major expansion of its gambling operations. The social networking site was criticised last year for launching a range of Las Vegas-style casino games with the promise of jackpots worth tens of thousands of pounds. It already offers virtual slot machines for children as young as 13 – with real money games advertised as soon as users hit their 18th birthday. Tie in: Facebook has announced a new partnership with bookmaker Paddy Power . Now it will begin offering sports betting under a lucrative deal with online bookmaker Paddy Power, which was announced last night. The game, called Paddy Power In-Play!, will be rolled out in the coming days. It will only be available in the UK, where gaming laws are more relaxed than in the US. Both companies claim they have rigorous safeguards to prevent minors from accessing the game, and Facebook insists adverts for the game cannot be viewed by anyone under 18. But critics and campaign groups have raised concerns that children could still access the online gambling pages, either by lying about their age or using a parent’s credit card. Research by the Gambling Commission in 2008 found that almost one million children had ‘gambling problems’, and said that a ‘high proportion of children and young people gambled’. Criticism: Facebook came under fire from campaign groups after the site launched Las Vegas-style casino games last year . On its website, campaign group Stop Children Gambling warns: ‘High Street Bookmakers have the same 18 year age limit but have the benefit of at least being able to determine whether the intended gambler at least looks old enough.

Facebook has three million UK users aged between 13 and 17. But a further one million are thought to be under 13 and pretending to be older. Any of these could already be playing the ‘free’ slot and bingo games - which critics say form gambling habits because they simulate the thrill of hitting the jackpot. ‘Research has shown again and again that one of the biggest factors in developing problem gambling is playing free games online first,’ said Mark Griffiths, professor of gambling studies at Nottingham Trent University, at the time Facebook launched its first real money casino game last December. Worries: Experts say gambling addiction often begins with players getting hooked on free games . Paddy Power last night said the game will ‘enable customers to bet on a wide variety of sporting events through Facebook, while also giving them visibility of, and the opportunity to engage with, other users’. Peter O’Donovan, managing director of Paddy Power Online said: ‘The launch of the first real money sports betting product on Facebook is testament to Paddy Power’s e-commerce and technology capabilities. ‘We are pleased to partner with Facebook on this pioneering work.’ Will Collins, head of social casino partnerships at Facebook, said: ‘Given the popularity of sports betting in the UK, we’re delighted to be welcoming Paddy Power onto the Facebook gaming platform with an innovative gaming experience.’ Online betting in Britain is now a business worth more than £2billion, it is estimated.

For most couples who are planning their wedding day, building a pirate ship to host the ceremony on is not near the top of their list of things to do. However, an Illinois man is busy putting the finishing touches to a pirate ship he has built in his front yard after convincing his fiancee to let him realize his boat-building dreams. Tony Miller and Kaela Schenk are due to get married on board the boat, which sits in a pond the couple dug in the garden of their Rockton home, next month. Plain sailing: Tony Miller is building a pirate ship that he plans to get married on . Dream project: Tony Miller and his fiancee Kaela Schenk survey their pirate ship . Miss Schenk said she had never taken her fiance's boat ambitions seriously, but when he suggested it for their Caribbean-themed wedding it seemed like the perfect idea. 'I always wanted to get married outside,' she told ABC News. 'So one thing led to another, and we bought the backhoe to start digging for the pond.' Crew mates: Kaela Schenk and Tony Miller are due to get married on their ship in August . However, the couple's plans were nearly . scuppered by Winnebago county officials who said they lacked the right . permit for such a structure. 'When I approached them, they said, ""We . can’t do anything because we have nothing for pirate ships"",' Mr Miller said. 'But now they do. It’s called an ""accessory structure"".’ Although work had to temporarily stop . while the permit issue was resolved, Mr Miller says he has been given . the full backing of the county, which worked hard to help him fix the . paperwork. 'We are 100 per cent behind them. I . think it’s a wonderful thing,' Jim Hughes, director of development . services for Winnebago County, said. 'A lot of people in the community . appreciate the ship, and the reason behind it is quite meaningful.' Mr Miller added: 'It’s something I’ve always wanted to . build. Something really unique and big and I could . tinker around with for a while.' The 35-year-old, who proposed to his fiancee last May, added that he wakes up smiling every day because his dream has come true. He added that before building the 23ft high, 53ft long ship, which is attached to a concrete platform and has been named U.S. Mutiny, he had no ship building experience. 'I didn't know anything about ships, but I studied them a lot and it was fun to do,'  he told ABC57. 'It was a hobby of mine in the winter. I took different types of ships and collaborated my favorite parts of each ship into one.' Strong foundations: Tony Miller is building the pirate ship on a concrete platform in a pond that he dug . Labor of love: The ship is based on a combination of a galleon and a frigate . Ship shape: Although the couple will marry on the ship, the wedding will not have a pirate theme . The final design, which is a combination of  a galleon and a frigate, will be able to hold about 30 people. 'It's definitely over the top. I definitely always wanted an outside wedding, but definitely never pictured being married on a pirate ship,' Miss Schenk said, adding that the ship is the only pirate element to their wedding on August 3.

The crackdown on excessive pay is designed to put an end to multi-million pound deals for executives at banks that have received taxpayers’ cash. Under the new terms, senior staff at banks receiving any new bailouts would see their pay pegged to the wages enjoyed by ordinary people. Top bankers who work at bailed out lenders are facing pay caps under new EU rules . Stephen Hester, who was axed last month as boss of Royal Bank of Scotland, was paid a basic salary of £1.2m for last year . The maximum payout would be the higher of 15 times the national average salary or 10 times the wage of the average worker at the bank. The UK’s national average wage is £26,500, according to the Office for National Statistics, implying a pay ceiling for senior bankers of £397,500. Stephen Hester, who was axed last month as boss of Royal Bank of Scotland after a series of run-ins with Chancellor George Osborne, was paid a basic salary of £1.2m for last year. The sum is about 45 times the UK national average salary, although he passed up his bonus for the year. Chancellor George Osborne is thought to fear that the plan will complicate his efforts to return Royal Bank of Scotland to private hands . Rise: Bonus pay rose dramatically in April this year, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics . The EU will also cap taxpayer-funded bonuses at twice the amount of an executive’s basic wage. The rules will not be applied to banks which have already received aid, such as RBS and Lloyds, which required a rescue package worth £65billion. Former Royal Bank of Scotland boss Fred Goodwin was paid a salary of £1.3million the year before the bank had to be bailed out . But they will apply to any bank that goes cap in hand to the government in future. The measures are intended to stop bankers taking reckless gambles in the knowledge that they will keep the profit, with taxpayers picking up the tab for losses in the event of a major mistake. Some £1.4trillion of cash has been pumped into ailing lenders since the banking crisis began in 2008. Britain, which has a larger banking sector than European counterparts, is understood to have opposed the new pay caps. Chancellor George Osborne is thought to fear that the plan, which will come into force next month, will complicate his efforts to potentially restructure Royal Bank of Scotland and find a new chief executive for the organisation. And British banks have lobbied fiercely against the new rules, which they say could limit their ability to attract talented executives. Germany has already put in place measures to cap pay at three of its bailed out banks at £430,000. The new pay rules arrived amid a broader revision of how to manage the failure of banks in the event of a financial crisis. The European Commission will require shareholders and bondholders of banks to be wiped out before granting approval for governments to use taxpayers’ cash to bail them out.","Crackdown designed to end multi-million pound deals for executives .

Dent called police, still unaware that he had accidentally mown her down in his 4x4 himself. Forensic tests later showed she had died from catastrophic injuries caused by his silver Mitsubishi pick-up. He told police he was so drunk at the time he did not remember driving into Miss Valente, 49.Yesterday he pleaded guilty at Carlisle Crown Court to causing death by careless driving while over the drink-drive limit. He was jailed for six years and banned from driving for three years. ‘I accept I am guilty despite my lack of recollection,’ he admitted. The jury heard he had been in an on-off relationship with the mother-of-five for more than ten years. Drinking: Miss Valente left the Castle Hotel (pictured) in Brough, Cumbria, at about 8.40pm to walk back to the farm, leaving Dent in the pub.

Miss Valente, of Bingley, West Yorkshire, left the Castle Hotel at Brough at 8.40pm to walk back to the farm, leaving Dent in the pub. Around an hour later, a drunken Dent climbed behind the wheel of his 4x4 and drove to the farm. During the journey he accidentally hit her, causing fatal injuries.But oblivious to what he had done, he carried on. When he arrived home, he drank vodka with his father before going to bed. The following morning – ten hours after the accident – Dent realised Miss Valente had not turned up and went out looking for her. He was arrested for failing a breath test after he found her body and called police. Hearing: Carlisle Crown Court (pictured) in Cumbria was told that the victim, a mother of five from Bingley, West Yorkshire, had been in an 'on and off' relationship with Dent for nearly 10 years . In a statement submitted to the court, Dent said he had no memory of the accident but accepted all the evidence showed he had been responsible, and was ‘extremely remorseful’. Dent was first charged with causing . death by dangerous driving but this was reduced to causing death by . careless driving after discussions between the police, prosecutors and .

With quite so many bundles of joy all lined up together, a bonny baby contest will inevitably involve the odd tantrum. In the Wiltshire town of Devizes, however, it’s not the toddlers who are throwing their toys out of the pram – it’s the grown-ups. The annual event has provoked a row after carnival organisers cancelled it for being ‘unfair’ to the children deemed less than bonny. Last year's winners: Organisers of Devizes Carnival, in Wiltshire, have ruled the 'bonny baby' contest is 'no longer an appropriate item' for the event. Pictured are last year's winners . But they reckoned without the mothers of Devizes, who have accused the committee of excessive ‘political correctness’ – and launched their own unofficial bonny baby contest. Stephanie Gale, 28, is the mother of one of last year’s winners, Toby. She said: ‘It’s a bit of fun and everybody likes looking at pictures of babies.’ Support: The alternative pageant has won the backing of Devizes Mayor Pete Smith (pictured), who said the event brings the community together . But Dave Buxton, of Devizes Outdoor Celebratory Arts, which organises the carnival, said: ‘It’s a really modern carnival with hundreds of people taking part. ‘Do you really think it is a good idea to judge babies and decide which ones are the best? 'We are a community arts organisation and it is not really appropriate. ‘It just doesn’t seem a very nice thing to do. Everyone believes that their baby is the best baby. 'How do you feel if your baby isn’t the one that has won?’ Organisers have also abolished the role of Carnival Queen this year as it does not ‘fit with the ethos’ of the event. The carnival procession will be held on August 31, with an unofficial ‘Mayor’s Baby Show’ four days beforehand. The alternative event has been organised by the former chairman of Devizes Carnival, Jeanette Von Berg, and endorsed by mayor Peter Smith. He said: ‘The committee are doing a good job, but people like the old-fashioned stuff. ‘They like to take their kids along and say “Granny did this when she was a little girl”. ‘The mums said it was political correctness gone mad and I agree – it’s absolutely stupid.’ Devizes: Committee members have also abolished the role of Carnival Queen as it does not 'fit with the ethos' of the event (picture shows general view of Devizes)","Organisers of Devizes Carnival ruled baby pageant 'no longer appropriate'

As many as 80,000 Bulgarians could move to Britain when new EU rules come into force in less than six months, it emerged today. A new survey has revealed that nearly 20 per cent of 15 to 55-year-olds - around 400,000 - want to escape their struggling country, with the UK at the top of their list. From January 1, Britain will not be able to stop eastern European nationals taking up residence here. Influx: Figures from the Office for National Statistics in May show 103,000 people born in Romania and Bulgaria are working in the UK . According to The Sun, . a poll by Afis carried out for the European Parliament shows the UK has . been the destination of choice for 22.5 per cent of Bulgarian migrants . in recent years. If the same proportion relocates next year, that could mean a further 80,000 Bulgarians coming to Britain. Bulgaria, which has a population of 7.3million, is one of the EU's poorest countries. UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the figures would put a huge strain on hospitals, schools and the benefits system. He . told The Sun: 'According to these figures, almost 100,000 Bulgarians . want to come here and that number may hit a million in future years. 'To stop them, we need to leave the EU - nothing else will do.' In search of a better life: Around 80,000 Bulgarians are expected to descend on Britain when border controls are relaxed in less than six months (file picture) At present, Romanians and Bulgarians can only work in Britain if they are self-employed or one of a limited number of seasonal employees who are allowed to work for six months before returning home. But from January 1 next year, citizens from the new EU member states win the right to unlimited access to Britain’s jobs market. Just 2,000 Romanian and Bulgarians worked in Britain in 1997, which jumped to 29,000 a decade later when the two countries joined the EU. Now there are more than 100,000 . More than 100,000 Romanians and Bulgarians have already come to live in this country, but under EU freedom of labour rules their citizens will be able to take British jobs without restrictions from January. The poll comes a day after it emerged that half a million more immigrants arrived in Britain from the European Union than was previously believed. It means immigration between mid-1997 and mid-2010, while Labour was in power, now totals nearly 4million, rather than the 3.4million recorded. The number of people who went under the radar would have filled a city the size of Manchester. A paper, published by the Office for National Statistics, has acknowledged for the first time that the majority of the people who slipped through the net were Eastern European migrants . The Office for National Statistics (ONS) discovered the mistake in May when they compared the results of the . 2011 census with the population that they had expected to find on the . basis of births, deaths and official immigration figures, Migrationwatch .

But campaigners such as Migrationwatch UK have warned that up to 250,000 Romanians and Bulgarians could arrive in the first five years after the restrictions are lifted on January 1, 2014. Stricter immigrations rules are being drafted by Home Secretary Theresa May, but these will not come into force until at least next Spring, so will miss the EU rule change.","Around 400,000 15 to 55-year-olds want to escape their struggling country .

Experts once advised people to run for a doorway when the earth begins to shake, now that’s out the window and scientists suggest jumping under the nearest table. But what if the table gives way? Two Israel scientist have a solution for that: earthquake-proof tables. Scroll down for video . Simple yet effective: Two inventors from Israel say this simple invention could protect millions of children--an earthquake proof table . Designed to withstand downward impacts of up to one ton, the table is the brainchild of Israeli inventors Arthur Brutter and Ido Bruno. Brutter and Bruno say the idea came out of the pressing need to protect school children in the developing world at risk of death and injury when earthquakes that strike their structurally unsound schools. ‘The earthquake-proof table started when I was a student in industrial design at the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design, Jerusalem,’  Brutter told CNN. ‘At the beginning I wanted a solution to help in natural disasters.’ Then Brutter witnessed footage of 2010’s catastrophic Haiti earthquake in which an estimated 200,000 people died as poorly constructed homes and schools easily buckled in the face of the 7.0 magnitude temblor. Bracing: The earthquake proof table was invented to withstand up to one ton downward impacts and protect those underneath them from temblor-strewn debris in developing countries . ‘I looked at pictures of a school that was crushed in the earthquake in Haiti and they really shocked me,’ he said. Along with his teacher, Bruno, Brutter devised a way to prevent such catastrophe. The solution is a cheap to make, easy to lift table for school children that can withstand massive impact when used as shelter from earthquake debris. ‘When something falls on the table it absorbs the object's energy, and debris is forced to the side,’ said Brutter. Though damaged, the table will protect those underneath from deadly impacts, an idea hatched after its inventors saw the aftermath of Haiti's 2010 earthquake that killed 200,000 . Necessary: The table's inventors say that some 300,000,000 school children attend school in structurally unsound buildings where the tables could save countless lives . The tables, when placed in rows like classroom desks, also act as a means of escape. With debris halted above, students can crawl through the clear passageways created by the tables, as can rescue workers. First tested by the Israeli military, the desk is now undergoing strict testing at Padua University’s Structural Engineering department in Italy. Ingenious: By creating space between cowering earthquake survivors and fallen debris, the tables also allow for the rescue of children after saving their lives . According to Brutter and Bruno, some 300 million school children worldwide are at risk from earthquakes because their buildings aren’t prepared for them. The team sees their earthquake proof table as a way to prevent deaths and injuries. The two have been applauded around the world for their invention and received numerous awards. But Brutter hopes no one ever has to depend on his life-saving invention. ‘It's always a good feeling to be recognised, but really it's not awards...we want there to be no earthquakes, and we want it to be used to save lives.’ Lifesaving: 'When something falls on the table it absorbs the object's energy, and debris is forced to the side' says inventor Arthur Brutter .","Inventors hope the tables will spare the lives of people caught in unsound buildings during massive temblors like the 7.0 earthquake that leveled Haiti and killed 200,000 ."

By afternoon the fire was estimated at 17,500 acres, or more than 27 square miles. The mountain range also stretches into Carson City. Late in the day, fire officials closed popular back-country roads leading from the state capital into the mountains because of the fire's path. The blaze broke out on July 4 and firefighters initially hoped to have it contained Monday. But those ambitions were dashed Sunday when strong winds fanned the fire into an inferno that pushed to the northeast and created a towering, swirling smoke plume seen for miles.

Pressure: Ed Miliband (left) will not survive as Labour leader until the 2015 election, David Cameron believes . Conservative strategists want . to keep Mr Miliband in his job, believing he is unlikely to win . widespread support at the general election. Mr Cameron also believes Labour is deeply damaged by Andy Burnham continuing as shadow health secretary after the Mid Staffs scandal happened on his watch as Health Secretary. Mr Miliband’s position has become threatened revelations emerged about his union paymasters trying to influence candidate selection. Mr Cameron has stepped up his attacks on the Labour leader in recent weeks, branding him weak and in hoc to the unions. Now he has made clear to allies that he believes Mr Miliband's time could be up as Labour leader. A . Tory source said: ‘The PM thinks Miliband will go before the election. This union stuff has dragged on now and he really looks in trouble. Foreign Secretary William Hague became embroiled in a row after calling a Labour MP a 'stupid woman' in the Commons. As Cathy Jamieson asked David Cameron about donations to the Tory party, Mr Hague was seen on the frontbench muttering 'stupid woman, stupid woman'. Miss Jamieson had raised questions about whether donations from Aidan Heavey had influenced Mr Hague's decision to intervene in his company's tax dispute. Mr Cameron replied: 'The donations to the Conservative Party do not buy votes to our party conference, they don't buy votes for our leader, they don't mean you can select candidates. That is the unhealthy relationship in British politics.' But Mr Hague was seen making the remark while sitting next to the PM. He later told the Commons: 'I mutter many things in this House. 'Others shout them rather louder than I do but I mutter many things under my breath and I never intend any offence to any other honourable members.' Downing Street said it was a 'humorous remark'. ‘There . was a time when it was doubtful if any of the party leaders would . survive until the election. But the Tories are more settled now and the . Lib Dems seem stuck with Clegg. It’s Miliband who looks vulnerable now. 'Andy Burnham is also a problem for them, after everything that happened at Mid Staffs.' Bookmakers now offer odds of 9/2 that Mr Miliband will be replaced as leader before the election, with Yvette Cooper and Chuka Umunna among the favourites to replace him. In the Commons today the two leaders engaged in angry clashes over party funding in the wake of the Falkirk ballot-rigging row. The . Prime Minister accused the Labour leader of having been 'bought' by . union paymasters, and said he could not gloss over Unite's efforts to . fix parliamentary selections. But . Mr Miliband hit back, insisting that his Tory counterpart was 'owned by . a few millionaires at the top of society', challenging him to agree a . £5,000 cap on donations from individuals, businesses and trade unions. Mr Miliband used a major speech . yesterday to seek to put a lid on the scandal, promising ‘big changes’ to the Labour party’s relationship with the unions. But . after the plans were welcomed by both Unite’s general secretary Len . McCluskey and former Prime Minister Tony Blair, there are fears in the . Labour party that they will do little to reassure voters that Mr . Miliband is showing strong leadership. At Prime Minister's Questions today . Mr Miliband claimed that the Conservative Party had received £24 million . in donations from hedge funds. He urged the Tory leader to reopen stalled talks on party funding reform and sign up to a donation cap. But . Mr Cameron said all donations to his party were publicly declared, and . warned that a cap could cost the taxpayer millions of pounds. The . Prime Minister said: 'Here are the figures - £8 million from Unite, £4 . million from GMB, £4 million from Unison. They have bought the policies, . they have bought the candidates and they have bought the leader. 'I . have long supported caps on donations. I think we should have caps on . donations and they should apply to trade unions, to businesses and to . individuals. 'But let . me be frank with you, there's a problem with a 5,000 cap. It is this - . it would imply a massive amount of taxpayer support for political . parties. 'Frankly, I don't see why the result of a trade union scandal should be every taxpayer in the country paying for Labour.' Weakness: Senior Tories have also identified shadow health secretary Andy Burnham (left) as a target for his links to the Mid Staffs scandal . Row: Mr Cameron, pictured walking to the Commons today, tried to brush aside the Labour call for a £5,000 cap on donations . At Prime Minister’s Questions last . week Mr Cameron accused Mr Miliband of being ‘too weak to sack his . Health Secretary (Mr Burnham)... too weak to stand up to the Unite union, too weak to . run Labour, and certainly too weak to run the country’. The . PM could barely contain his glee that the Unite union was demanding ‘a . firmly class-based and left-wing general election campaign’. Since . then the row over the role of Unite in allegedly trying to fix a . candidate selection in Falkirk and elsewhere has escalated. While Labour has descended into internal warfare, the Conservatives have enjoyed one of their best periods in government. In . the last week Mr Cameron has seen more than 300 Tory MPs backed a Bill . promising an in-out referendum on Britain’s membership, hate cleric Abu . Qatada finally put on a plane to Jordan, increasing optimism that the . economy is growing faster than expected and even welcomed Andy Murray to . Number 10 after his Wimbledon triumph. Glee: Mr Cameron could barely contain his delight at sharing the limelight with Wimbledon winner Andy Murray outside Number 10 this week . Delight: The Tory mood has been buoyed by the success in deporting hate cleric Abu Qatada to Jordan after a decade of legal battles . In recent days Labour’s lead over the Conservatives has fallen to just six per cent in some polls. Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband will lock horns across the despatch box again today, with Labour’s union woes likely to dominate. However, some Tories will urge the Prime Minister to ease off on attacking Mr Miliband, believing the Labour leader remains key to a Conservative election victory. The Opposition leader will attempt to turn the focus back on the Tories after a week of deeply damaging allegations about ballot-fixing in the Falkirk constituency. Yesterday Mr Miliband set out radical proposals to end the automatic affiliation of union members Labour - a move that party figures acknowledge could cost it millions of pounds a year. But Unite general secretary Len McCluskey confounded expectations of a furious showdown with unions by insisting he was ‘very comfortable’ with the idea. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair hailed the plan as ‘a real act of leadership’ and admitted that he should probably have taken the same step when he was in charge between 1994 and 2007.","PM believes Ed Miliband will not survive as polling day approaches .

A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘Number 10 had no water for at least two hours and the Cabinet Office at 70 Whitehall was also affected. ‘It meant that obviously we were unable to make a cup of tea or have a drink of water, but I think it was resolved fairly promptly.’ Supplies were affected for five hours until around 7pm, leaving some MPs forced to take refuge in Parliament's bars in search of refreshment.

Turkish police fired tear gas and water cannon at protesters who tried to enter an Istanbul park at the centre of protests against Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's government. Hundreds of people were forced to leave Gezi Park before the start of the protest on Monday organised by the Taksim Solidarity group of political parties and non-governmental organisations. They are protesting over plans to redevelop the area. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A Turkish riot police officer uses tear gas to disperse protestors during an anti-government protest near Taksim Square in Istanbul . Police intervened with a water cannon to break up a crowd of several thousand marching along Istanbul's main pedestrian shopping street towards Taksim Square where the park is located before firing tear gas to break up smaller pockets of protesters. After a police crackdown on a small demonstration on May 31, the Gezi Park protests grew into broader action against what critics see as Erdogan's increasingly authoritarian style of government. The unrest died down in late June but on Saturday police went in to disperse protesters who wanted to march on Taksim Square. Erdogan has pressed for significant reforms in the economy and curtailed the power of the military which toppled four governments in four decades. Turkish riot police use a water cannon to disperse protestors near Taksim Square in Istanbul, Turkey . Opponents argue that during the June unrest he appealed increasingly to Islamist elements of his AK Party faithful. Hours before Monday's police intervention, Governor Huseyin Avni Mutlu spoke enthusiastically about the park's reopening. 'We have seen with the visit carried out today that all our work has been completed,' Mutlu told reporters in the park, which has been spruced up with the planting of new trees, plants and lawns since the protesters were evicted on June 15. 'People became brothers here, and it will be very crowded tonight because we all missed that brotherhood. This park will always be the symbol of people's unity, power and harmony,' university student Ozer Sari, 22, told Reuters. However, 54-year-old Abdullah Dogan dismissed the idea that the protests were about protecting the park.

'This was about overthrowing the government, a government which did its duty and took over the park, cleaned it and returned it to the people in better shape,' he said. Taksim Solidarity, which is opposed to the construction of a replica Ottoman era barracks on the site, had called on Sunday for its supporters to hold a public meeting. A police official told Reuters they evacuated the park because there were illegal groups inside who planned protests. Four people were killed and 7,500 wounded in last month's police crackdown, according to the Turkish Medical Association. The Council of Europe's Human Rights Commissioner pressed Turkey on Monday to investigate reports police used excessive force to contain the protests and punish anyone found guilty. An elderly man sits on the marbles of Gezi Park next to a cordon which reads 'Police - No entry' A Turkish court has cancelled the Taksim Square redevelopment project, including the construction of the replica barracks, although the authorities can appeal against the ruling. The ruling marked a victory for the coalition against the project and a blow for Erdogan, who stood firm against protests and riots he said were stoked by terrorists and looters. Erdogan has said he would wait for the judicial process to be completed before proceeding with the Taksim plans, one of several large projects for Istanbul, including a major airport, a large Mosque and a canal to ease Bosphorus traffic. If Turkey's top administrative court rules in favour of the development on appeal, Erdogan has still pledged to hold a referendum in Istanbul on the government's plan but he will drop the project if the court rejects it.","People were forced to leave Gezi Park before the start of the protest on Monday over plans to redevelop the area .

The device used by the trio made it appear that a user’s card had been ‘swallowed’ by an ATM. However, the cards were simply trapped inside a contraption so they could be retrieved later by the thieves, Gloucester Crown Court was told. Caught: Lucien Dascalescu (left) and Mihai Dragan (right) were jailed for 18 months each . A mobile phone hidden inside the device photographed the user keying in his or her PIN number so the crooks would be able to use the cards later. The court was told the Romanians obtained the device after finding it freely available for sale on the Internet. However, their plot was quickly foiled by Gloucestershire police and the trio made less than £90 before they were arrested. Cristian Tudor was jailed for 13 months for his part in the bank card scam . Two of the defendants had only been in the UK for a few weeks before launching the scam. Lucien Dascalescu, 28, from Coventry, Mihai Dragan, 27, from Coventry and Christian Tudor, 21, from Leicester, all admitted conspiracy to steal by the use of a card trapping device allowing the PIN to be recorded and the card used for theft from the holder’s account.

Summer Rogers-Ratcliffe was 21 months old when she was found dying in her cot from head injuries. Experts agree the injuries ‘must have been deliberate’. But after a 15-month police inquiry, the Crown Prosecution Service refused to charge any of the family members arrested over her death because of ‘insufficient evidence’. The decision infuriated Summer’s father and grandparents who have spoken out to demand ‘justice’ for the innocent little girl. Loss: Toddler Summer Rogers-Ratcliffe was found in her cot with fatal head injuries. Police have yet to charge anyone in connection with her death . Plumber Joss Ratcliffe, 24, who lost his only child, said: ‘This should go to a jury to decide. If a child is killed in her house and they know who was looking after her then it should at least go to trial.’ Summer was found unwell in her cot by her grandmother at 8.30am on February 27 last year, after the mother and her boyfriend had left their Dewsbury home separately for work. Susan Rogers, 57, dialled 999 but Summer died in the local hospital’s intensive care unit. Her mother Victoria Rogers, 26, boyfriend Craig Sharp, 34, and Mrs Rogers were arrested on suspicion of murder, but have been released from police bail. We want justice: Summer's father Joss Ratcliffe (centre) and grandparents Deborah (left) and James Ratcliffe (right) want a court case . Miss Rogers insists she wants ‘justice’ for her daughter and claims to have ‘begged’ prosecutors to charge both her and her now ex-boyfriend so a jury can decide the truth. Experts said the fatal injuries were likely to have been inflicted within 12 to 24 hours before Summer died. Murder and manslaughter charges were rejected because detectives couldn’t prove ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ who caused the injuries. An offence of ‘causing or allowing the death of a child’ was also ruled out because the CPS said the charge required a ‘history of serious violence towards Summer’ to be established. Victoria Rogers is the mother of Summer. She claims to have 'begged' prosecutors to charge both her and her ex-boyfriend Craig Sharp so a jury can decide the truth . The CPS said: ‘There is no evidence of a history of serious harm having been caused to Summer by any of the suspects nor was there any reason for the need to protect her.’ But Summer’s father and his parents disagree and say the authorities played down previous incidents of alleged physical abuse. Summer was taken to hospital with serious burns to her hand 11 months before her death. Miss Rogers could not explain the injury. The toddler’s paternal grandmother Deborah Ratcliffe, 49, a school finance officer, phoned the health visitor to express concerns about the burn and an unexplained bruise to Summer’s ear a few weeks earlier. Summer pictured with her mother's now ex-boyfriend Craig Sharp . Mrs Ratcliffe, from Dewsbury, told the Mail: ‘We can’t just let our granddaughter be murdered and get a letter from the CPS to say “I’m sorry, there’s nothing we can do”, and get on with our lives as if nothing has happened. ‘We want justice for Summer.’ Miss Rogers told police Summer was well when she left at 6am. Mr Sharp said the girl was asleep when he left at 7.40am. Mrs Rogers, a retired nurse, told police Summer appeared to be asleep when she checked on her between 7.45 and 8.30am, when she found her unwell. Miss Rogers told the Mail she was ‘absolutely disgusted’ at the CPS decision. She said: ‘I have done nothing wrong. I want justice for her more than anybody else.’ Mr Sharp added: ‘I was upset with the police not bringing charges. I want the truth to come out.’ A West Yorkshire Police spokesman said: ‘The investigation remains open pending any new evidence.’ Unresolved: West Yorkshire Police say the investigation remains open pending any new evidence .

A teenager who murdered a 'promising' A-level student as he tried to recover a stolen smartphone has been jailed for a minimum of 13 years. Dogan Ismail, 17, suffered a single stab wound to the heart as he tried to get back a BlackBerry robbed from another 15-year-old during an altercation two days earlier. Today his killer, Dawda Jallow, 15, from Peckham, London, was ordered to serve at least 13 years of a life sentence after he was found guilty of murder by a jury. Dawda Jallow, 15, (left) was ordered to serve at least 13 years of a life sentence after he was found guilty of murdering Dogan Ismail (right) Before passing sentence at the Old Bailey, Judge Christopher Moss took the unusual step of lifting an order granting him anonymity as a minor. The judge told Jallow that the attack was carried out with 'force and ferocity' but added that he could not be sure whether he intended to kill his victim. Wearing a blue polo shirt and jeans, Jallow stared at the ground as his sentence was read out with members of his and his victim’s families looking on. Jallow had been caught carrying a knife twice before the attack took place on December 30 last year, the court heard. His mother had sent him back to the Gambia, where they are originally from, in a bid to keep him out of trouble but when he returned he was 'disruptive' at school. On camera: CCTV image of Dawda Jallow standing on a bus. He has been jailed today for murdering a 17-year-old boy . Judge Moss described him as a 'troubled boy who appeared to have a difficult background' due to the lack of a relationship with his father. 'You have said you recognise the effect that your actions have had on those who loved him (Dogan) and I can only hope that is the case,' he said. In a victim impact statement read out in court on her behalf, Dogan’s mother, Ozel Ismail, said the killing had plunged her and her family into a 'living nightmare'. Speaking of the love she felt for her first-born child, she said he had been 'worth every sleepless night'. She described him as a 'highly ambitious' boy with dreams of setting up a business of his own, adding: 'He was responsible, caring and a young man with integrity.' 'I had dreams with Dogan - his first job, his first car, his first serious girlfriend,' she said. 'Those dreams have been stolen from me and have died with Dogan.' The crime happened after another 15-year-old had his BlackBerry stolen on the Aylesbury Estate in Walworth, south London, on December 28 last year. Devastated: Ozel Ismail, mother of victim Dogan Ismail, said the killing plunged her into a 'living nightmare' On December 30, Dogan and the smartphone’s owner went back to the estate in an attempt to reclaim it. They confronted Dogan’s killer, who went into a flat and returned with what police described as a 'large' knife. The Walworth Academy sixth-form student was found outside Latimer House in Beaconsfield Road by paramedics, but despite their efforts he was pronounced dead at the scene. Police decided to name Jallow as a suspect on New Year’s Eve and pictures were later released of him travelling on the number 35 bus from Camberwell Green to Newington Causeway eight hours after the killing. After two weeks on the run, he handed himself in to police and later admitted manslaughter and theft before being found guilty of murder by a jury. The murder was the second fatal knife attack on the Aylesbury Estate in just four months - Shaun Chambers, 21, was stabbed to death in the same spot last September. Detective Chief Inspector Matt Bonner welcomed the sentence for what he described as an 'appalling and violent attack'. 'Jallow did all he could to evade capture in the weeks following the attack, until he realised there was nowhere left to run,' he said. 'He will now spend a significant amount of time behind bars for the callous crime that he has committed.'","Dogan Ismail was stabbed in the heart trying to reclaim a stolen phone .

They had to put Sam in a medically-induced coma while they ran further tests. He was in the coma for 36 hours and has since recovered - but his family have issued a warning against the craze. Mr Thomas said: ‘I picked him up and he had no blue in his eyes, they were all black. There was nothing I could do to help him.

Guilty: Teacher Eppie Sprung Dawson, 27, was given a six month community order after admitting having sex with a 17-year-old pupil . A teacher who was caught having sex with a teenage pupil in a layby has been spared jail and given a six month community payback order. Eppie Sprung Dawson, 27, picked up the 17-year-old pupil in Dumfries and drove to a secluded spot between Cummertrees and Hoddam where they had sex in the front seat of her car, a court heard. But the pair were discovered by patrolling police officers who noticed the parked car. Earlier this year, Dawson admitted that . on December 21 last year, while she was in a position of trust and being . the teacher of the youth, she engaged in sexual activities with, or . directed towards, a person under the age of 18 and that she had sexual . intercourse with him. Today she was ordered to sign the Sex Offenders' register for six months and will be placed under the supervision of social workers for the same length of time. Agent David Finnie said Dawson had undergone four sessions of counselling and had another 12 to complete and he added that it had become clear that there was counselling available for her and she had willingly taken this up on her own. Mr Finnie said she had undergone four sessions and she was finding it beneficial. He suggested that the whole matter be cleared up so that she could do what was necessary to get on with her life. 'This was a case of breach of trust rather than any form of abuse. I would suggest that the community payback order might be sufficient,' he said. Last month Sheriff George Jamieson told her that but for her being a teacher, she would not be facing a charge because the pupil would have been the age of consent. He told her that she had breached a position of trust. Mr Finnie described Sprung Dawson as a gifted, talented and committed teacher who was dedicated to her job.

With the end of the annual round of exams upon us, teenagers all over the country are celebrating the end of revision and swotting with glamorous American-style balls. But it seems even the humble limousine is no longer enough for pupils at one Somerset school who came up with some impressively elaborate ways of arriving in style. Mr Whippy anyone? Pupils Shaun Summers and Beckie Gardner, both 16, arrive at the Wadham school prom at Haselbury Mill in Crewkerne, inside an an ice cream van .

Among pupils set on making a splash at their prom were those who turned up on horseback, in vintage cars, a speedboad that played the James Bond theme and a Hell's Angel-style trike. Arriving in the speedboat, the aptly named Jealousy, was Josephine Whitehead, 16, from Illminster, who was accompanied by her friends Jamie Spicer, Connor Harris, Alex Jackson, and Aoife Gray. She said: 'Last year some a couple of people turned up dressed as Barbie inside a box, so we wanted to do something memorable as well.

A teenager has become the seventh person to die after 'taking fake ecstasy tablets' containing toxic chemicals. The 18-year-old woman died in Alexandria, West Dunbartonshire, Scotland, yesterday morning. Three male friends aged 18, 21 and 25 were admitted to the Royal Alexandra Hospital. Doctors are still treating the 25-year-old. Police in the west of Scotland have identified the pills, which have potentially fatal side effects, as green in colour and stamped with a crown logo and say some have been found to contain a dangerous stimulant Methoxyamphetamine, known as PMA. Warning: These potentially-lethal tablet which are being sold as ecstasy contain dangerous chemicals are believed to be connected to a series of deaths in Scotland . Police are also warning of a white pill with a Mitsubishi-style logo imprinted on it and yellow tablets with a star logo, which have been found to contain the chemicals 5IT or AMT, which can cause elevated core temperature, heart rate and seizures. Officers in the north of Scotland yesterday recovered a large quantity of fake ecstasy tablets at a house in Aberdeen. These tablets are also green but with the Heineken logo. Superintendent Grahame Clarke, from Police Scotland's western division, said: 'An investigation is under way and our inquiries have so far revealed that the woman, along with three friends, had taken what they thought were ecstasy tablets. The tablets were described as green with a Rolex crown logo stamped on them. 'Public warnings have been issued recently in relation to the dangers of taking ecstasy, or indeed tablets being passed off as ecstasy. They are illegal and could contain a cocktail of toxic ingredients. 'We have yet to establish if this particular pill is to blame for the death of this young woman, but the fact that she and her friends took pills described as green and with a Rolex stamp on it causes us real concern. 'The exact contents of the pills are unknown but they could contain dangerous chemicals and users need to be aware of the dangers and understand the devastating effect they can have.' Following the incident yesterday, Chief Inspector George MacDonald, based in Aberdeen, said: 'The exact contents of these particular pills are unknown at this time. What we have found is that they contain more than one class C drug as well as another dangerous substance, PMA. Police have also issued warnings about white pills with the Mitsubishi logo, left, which have been found to contain the chemicals 5IT or AMT and a yellow tablet with a star printed on it, pictured right . In hospital: Three male friend aged 18, 21 and 25 were taken to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Scotland after allegedly taking the pills . 'While these tablets do not feature the distinctive Rolex logo found on those in the Glasgow area they do contain the same toxic substance. 'The impact of taking a drug you do not know the exact content of can be extremely dangerous and fatal in some cases. 'Taking it just once can be one time too many and I would urge people to avoid any such pills or drugs and report any information to the police.' People taking the fake pills can experience symptoms including high temperature, aggression and muscle pains as well as hallucinations and excitability, medics said. Richard Stevenson, a doctor in emergency medicine at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, said: 'These symptoms are treatable if help is sought early. I would urge anyone who begins to feel unwell or feels a more intense high than usual after taking any drug which they think is ecstasy or not to seek immediate medical help.' Police are keen to get the warning across ahead of this weekend's T in the Park music festival in Balado, Perth and Kinross. Drugs 'amnesty bins' will be available at the entrance to the campsites where illegal substances can be disposed of without risk of prosecution, police said. Mr MacDonald said: 'We want to encourage people to enjoy themselves but our priority is keeping people safe and we want to make them aware of the direct dangers of becoming involved with drugs.'","Woman, 18, died in Alexandria, West Dunbartonshire, Scotland, yesterday .

A juror who overslept when his alarm clock failed to go off because of a power failure has been fined £250. Architecture student Thomas Kelcher's lateness earned him a severe ticking off from Judge Guy Kearl, QC, who told him he had cost the taxpayer more than £12,000. The university student was due at Leeds Crown Court at 10.30am yesterday where the jury was hearing the case of a man accused of sex offences, but did not appear until after 1pm. He told the judge there had been a power cut at his parents' home in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, and his alarm clock had turned off. He said: 'I know it’s not a good excuse.' Judge Kearl asked him what time he went to bed on Monday night and was told midnight. 'So you slept 12-and-a-half hours non-stop?' asked the judge. 'Yes,' replied Kelcher. His fellow jurors were waiting to resume considering verdicts in the trial of a Huddersfield man accused of sex offences. Kelcher arrived after 1pm when the jury retired and reached verdicts in the trial, but was kept in court to be dealt with after the rest of the jury left. The judge said that Kelcher had already been warned about being late one day last week. He said: 'This is now the second occasion you have been extremely late. 'That is not only a question of disrespect for the court but for everybody involved in the case, not least the defendant awaiting the outcome of his case no doubt anxiously, but also to your fellow members of the jury.'

"By . Anthony Bond  and Mark Duell . PUBLISHED: . 19:37 EST, 9 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:07 EST, 10 July 2013 . A teenage driver and his passenger died after he broke the speed limit to get home to beat his insurance company’s curfew, a coroner has said. Oliver Pain’s policy allowed him to drive between 5am and 11pm and his Renault Clio was fitted with a Global Positioning System ‘black box’ that monitored when it was driven and how fast. A breach of the curfew would have incurred a £100 penalty - but he would not have been penalised for speeding unless he was 50 per cent over the limit. Friends: Oliver Pain (second right, striped top), 18, repeatedly broke speed limits as he drove at up to 74mph as he and his friend Harry Smith (second left, light blue top), 17, returned home . Mr Pain, 18, repeatedly broke speed limits as he drove at up to 74mph as he and his friend Harry Smith, 17, returned home to North Nibley, near Dursley, Gloucestershire, from Chipping Sodbury, near Bristol. They were minutes from home when, at 10.42pm on November 13 last year, Mr Pain lost control of the car at a bend on a lane near the M5 Michaelwood services and hit two trees. Both teenagers died of head injuries. Returning verdicts of accidental death at the inquest in Gloucester yesterday, acting Gloucestershire coroner David Dooley said he was satisfied Mr Pain’s rush to beat the curfew was ‘a very significant factor in his driving’. Mr Dooley will write to insurers Towergate Smart to voice his ‘real concern of future deaths’ over rules which he said ‘incentivise’ young drivers to speed to beat the curfew. Gloucestershire Police collision investigator David Holland said the car . was doing 57mph when it went out of control. The limit on the lane was . 60mph and the tracking system showed that Mr Pain had reached up to 74 . mph that night. But for the seven to eight months before the accident Mr Pain had . complied well with the speed and curfew limits set by the insurers, PC . Holland said. 'This trip seems to have been an exception to his . previous driving record,' the officer said. 'He exceeded the limit . throughout the journey right up to the collision point. 'One must . question why he decided he needed to drive quickly on this journey - the . answer to which, I believe, lies with the tracking device and the . criteria of its use. 'It is probable he believed he had to hurry back . to avoid a curfew penalty. On that journey he exceeded the speed limit . on numerous occasions. Horror: Teenage driver Oliver Pain and Harry Smith died following a crash on on a lane near the M5, pictured . 'But none of the speeds would have attracted any . sort of reprimand from IQ.' Speaking at the inquest, Mr Dooley said: 'It does appear that the curfew was the factor causing him to drive as he did. 'On . the balance of probabilities I think his decision to go at this speed . was due to his wish to avoid breaching the curfew penalty.' How it works: Towergate Smart's managing director said the technology had been launched in 2006 . Under . Rule 43 of the Coroners Act, he would write to Towergate Smart to voice . his ‘real concern of future deaths’ if the system was not amended, he . said. The coroner said he acknowledged that the system was designed . by Towergate to reduce irresponsible driving by young motorists and . therefore reduce insurance premiums with a reward system. But it . appeared the system had also created a risk. 'My letter will be . asking that this risk is addressed,' he said. 'There is a fresh . potential risk arising from the institution of this curfew. 'I would . suggest perhaps a balance should be struck between the penalties imposed . for breach of curfew and for speeding. Perhaps the maximum speed limits . should be reduced. 'It may require extra technology but it is . something I believe should be addressed. I don’t raise any question of . blame in respect of the technology. 'It is designed, as far as I can see, . with good intentions. It might only need fine tuning of the penalties . to avoid the deaths of young drivers trying to beat the clock.' Towergate Smart’s managing director Ian Brown told the inquest the technology had been launched in 2006. Two young drivers had died in accidents while subject to the system but neither was on the road close to curfew time, he said. 'There is a fresh potential risk arising from the institution of this curfew' Coroner David Dooley . He said the driving record of all policy holders was taken into account when insurance was renewed and those who had not been speeding would get lower premiums. 'We have sold over 15,000 of these policies and this is the first case I have come across like this,' he said. The average financial saving for a young driver who bought one of their policies and agreed to the penalty clauses would be £450 to £500 a year, he added. The reason for the 11pm-5am curfew was that those were the hours when most severe accidents involving young drivers occurred, he said. Insurance: A breach of the curfew would have incurred a £100 penalty - but he would not have been penalised for speeding unless he was 50 per cent over the limit. A file image of a black box is pictured . Currently the ‘black box’ policy means that youngsters can drive up to 50 per cent over the speed limit before they get a warning from the insurer - up to 90mph on a road with a 60mph speed limit. Mr Pain’s mother Rebecca said she felt the speeding condition should be lowered. ‘It gives them too much leeway - 50 per . cent is too high,’ Mrs Pain said. ‘It needs to be more like the police . rules, which are 10 per cent over, plus 2mph.’ 'We had told him that if he thought he was not going to be home by 11pm to call us and tell us. We might have been a bit miffed but we would sort out getting him home' Natalie Pain, 44, Oliver's mother . She also believes that learner drivers should be taught to drive at a speed suitable for the conditions, rather than driving to a speed limit. ‘These country roads have a 60mph speed limit but it is not safe to drive at that speed,’ she said. ‘He was going 57mph at the time of his accident, but he was going above the speed limit. ‘At the time of Ollie's accident it was also wet roads, there were leaves, and everyone here knows it is a road notorious for lots of deer. Kids need to be taught to drive for the individual conditions.’ Mr Pain was quoted more than £3,000 for an insurance policy when he passed his test - and the black box reduced that to £1,850. But Mrs Pain, 44, is not convinced that her son was speeding in order to beat the curfew. ‘He was three minutes from home and had 18 minutes to get back when the accident happened,’ she said. ‘Ollie knew he had to be home by 11pm. He was minutes from home. We had told him that if he thought he was not going to be home by 11pm to call us and tell us. We might have been a bit miffed but we would sort out getting him home.’","Oliver Pain's insurance policy allowed him to .

A teenager whose defective car crashed in to a lake, drowning his best friend, put a picture of a dead body floating in water on his Facebook page, a judge heard. Student Max Parker lost control of his Peugeot 206 because his brakes were next to useless and a worn rear tyre was flat. The car plunged into a hotel lake in Staffordshire and although Parker and his girlfriend Laura Montana survived, rear passenger Ben Henshaw, a 16-year-old schoolboy, drowned. Max Parker (left) , 19, was driving his girlfriend home with Ben Henshaw (right), 16, in the back seat when he lost control and skidded in to the lake at Patshull, Staffs, last August . Months after the fatal accident, Ben’s family found the 'offensive' picture on Facebook. Parker, aged 19, of Greenway Avenue, Bridgnorth, Shropshire was sent to youth custody for 30 months and banned from driving for five years after admitting causing death by dangerous driving by reason of a defective car. Judge Michael Challinor told Parker; 'The harm you have done cannot be understated - the Facebook entry is utterly shocking, demonstrating what some would regard as a callous disregard for the family’s feelings. It is a revolting image which drives me to conclude the remorse you feel isn’t as deep as others have indicated.' Ben’s mother Trudy, from Alveley, Shropshire said: 'my son was missing in that lake for 17 hours, seeing that image just sickens me.' Crash site: Ben was missing for 17 hours before his body was pulled from Great Pool in Burnhill Green, Staffordshire . Stafford crown court heard that Parker was taking his girlfriend home with Ben in the back seat when the young driver lost control and skidded in to the lake at Patshull, Staffs. just before midnight on 6 August last year. Parker dived back in to the water to try to find his pal but couldn’t. A massive search of the lake was launched but Ben’s body was not found until the following day, said Miss Joanne Barker, prosecuting. The defects to Parker’s car were so bad that vehicle examiners ruled they were the cause of the crash. Parker told police he knew about them but didn’t have the money to get them fixed. Miss Nicola Bell, defending, said Parker maintained the Facebook picture was unrelated to the accident - it was an album cover not designed by him.

"By . Daniel Martin and Matt Chorley . PUBLISHED: . 18:50 EST, 9 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:14 EST, 10 July 2013 . Patients' lives are being put at risk because thousands of healthcare assistants in hospitals across the country receive no training at all, an inquiry has found. A third of trusts do not even check whether the assistants, who carry out a range of vital caring tasks instead of nurses, can read or write properly, according to a government-commissioned study. The only training some staff received before caring for the sick was watching a DVD. Check-up: Journalist Camilla Cavendish (left) was asked by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to carry out a review following the Francis Inquiry into the Mid-Staffs scandal, where up to 1,200 died unnecessarily in short-staffed and filthy A&E wards . Report author Camilla Cavendish warned the NHS is 'extremely bad at getting rid of people', damaging public confidence in the entire health service. 'I think what you need is proper leadership and management, which is in every care home and every hospital the employers are held responsible for the quality of those staff and they are held responsible for meeting certain basic standards of competence and care,' she told BBC Radio 4. The situation is so dangerous because on most wards there are more healthcare assistants than fully-trained nurses. The Cavendish review was ordered in the wake of the Mid Staffs scandal in which hundreds of patients are thought to have died needlessly as a result of poor care and neglect. All healthcare assistants in hospitals and home helps employed by councils should undergo the same basic level of training so that the public could be confident they were ‘up to the job’, Miss Cavendish said. They should be forced to go through a two-week induction and then undergo a six-month probation period, during which they are monitored to ensure they are providing decent care. If they fail, they would have to be sacked. Miss Cavendish said there was a tendency to ‘understate’ what we regard as basic patient care, what it actually involves and how important it is. ‘I’m proposing a certificate of fundamental care which will be a basic minimum of care.. infection control, dementia awareness... ‘The best hospitals are giving people inductions and then having long probationary periods where members of staff are supervised. Everything I’ve recommended is based on what the best organisations are doing,’ she said. She said there had to be a cultural change in the NHS towards the role of care staff. ‘There are 60 different titles for healthcare assistants – they should all be called nursing assistants, they should have clear job descriptions, and be held accountable against what they are responsible for.’ Lax: The lack of training for healthcare assistants was a key criticism in the Mid-Staffs scandal . Healthcare assistants provide some of . the most personal and fundamental care to patients  when they are in . hospital or help those with long-term conditions to live as . independently as possible in their own home. This . may include turning patients in bed so they do not get pressure sores, . helping them to eat and wash and to get out of bed and get dressed. The review raised concerns that workers need to monitor patients and respond to them. There are around 300,000 healthcare assistants in the NHS and 350,000 nurses. Health . Secretary Jeremy Hunt ordered the review following the Francis Inquiry . into the Mid-Staffs scandal, where up to 1,200 died unnecessarily in . short-staffed and filthy A&E wards. The lack of training for healthcare assistants was a key criticism, and the review has found that the system is even worse than thought. It concluded: ‘The system does not currently guarantee the safety of the public. ‘There are no minimum educational requirements to begin working as a healthcare assistant or support worker in the NHS or social care. Even literacy and numeracy are not always tested. ‘Around two thirds of acute trusts are now using numeracy and literacy tests to screen  candidates across most of  their organisations. But a third do not. ‘The review has also heard from home care workers whose ‘induction’ consisted of being handed a DVD to watch at home, before going out to a client.’ There are around 300,000 healthcare assistants in the NHS and 350,000 nurses . Cavendish recommends that all healthcare assistants and social care support workers should have the same basic training, based on the existing best practice. The review added: ‘Many of us will rely on healthcare assistants at some point in our lives, in particular in old age, and we need them to be as good as they can possibly be – especially as some support workers are carrying out procedures which used to be done by nurses, even doctors.’ The Department of Health said it would respond to the recommendations later in the year. Earlier this year, Royal College of Nursing general secretary Peter Carter said that the majority of healthcare assistants have no more than an hour’s training before being let loose on wards. * A hospital A&E unit has been given a serious warning by the health watchdog for turning away ambulances 23 times because it did not have enough staff. Queen’s Hospital in Romford, Essex, has been told to make urgent improvements by the Care Quality Commission after patients were also made to wait up to 14 hours in the casualty department – ten hours more than Government targets.","Healthcare assistants must be better trained, according to review .

It means that Britain - already dubbed the ‘whiplash capital of the . world’ with more than £1billion of bogus claims a year - is now also . beating the US as the most litigious country in the world. Fresh evidence shows that there has been a boom in 'claims farming' by law firms of backdated incidents which has artificially boosted the number of claimants . Leading insurance analysts say new figures show whiplash claims have increased by a disproportionately high level at a time when claims for accident damage to cars have decreased. By rights, crash and injury data should run in tandem, they say. They blamed the alarming disparity on a boom in American style ‘claims farming’ by law firms and claims firms of backdated or historic incidents which is artificially boosting the number of whiplash claimants - many of them bogus or exaggerated. The fresh evidence was revealed by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (IFoA) which independently assesses financial risks and liabilities to businesses and pension funds. It said there was a five per cent increase in the proportion of accidents involving third-party injury claims involving bodily injury in England and Wales last year. Nine out of ten of these were from ‘small whiplash-like claims’ of under £20,000 - with the average being £9,512. However, at the same time there has been a decrease in third party insurance claims involving damage to cars. The report was authored by David Brown, chairman of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries who recently told MP watchdogs that up to 60 per cent of whiplash claims were ‘exaggerated, misrepresented or fraudulent’ meaning up to £1billion claims a year are wholly or partly bogus. He explained: ‘A total of 90per cent of the third party injury claims made in 2012 were what we consider ‘small claims’ for less than £20,000.’ ‘Coupled with the average claim figure of £9,512, this suggests that the majority of claims continue to be for whiplash-like injuries.’ A number of claims made last year were for accidents in 2011 and 2010, suggesting that a high volume of back-dated claims have been filed. This is known as ‘claims farming’. Mr Brown noted: ‘The data we have collected for the last four years clearly shows a decrease in the number of accidents and you would expect that to correspond with a decrease in the number of third party injury claims. ‘Instead we have seen an increase in injury claims. The motor insurance industry paid out £2.2billion in whiplash claims in 2011 . ‘This could mean that people are driving less safely. However police data shows that the number of motor accidents involving casualties has decreased. The other conclusion that you can draw is that claims farming is on the increase.’ Mr Brown added: ‘The proportion of claims for insured accidents involving bodily injury is higher in the UK than in the USA, which is generally considered the most litigious jurisdiction.’ He noted the recent suggestion by the House of CommonsTransport Select Committee - to which he gave evidence - that the UK was the ‘whiplash capital of the world’ noting: ’They may well have a point.” The Institute and Faculty of Actuaries’ figures were based on analysis of third-party motor claims, looking at data from around 95percent of the UK motor insurance industry. The motor insurance industry paid out £10.7 billion in claims in 2011, of which whiplash claims cost approximately £2.2 billion, the Association of British Insurers (ABI) has told MPs. With whiplash claims representing 20 per cent of overall claims expenditure, this represents approximately £90 of the average premium. The ABI blamed the dysfunctional compensation system’ for leading to a ‘growing compensation culture’ in the UK, as well as ‘aggressive marketing by claims management companies’. Referral fees paid by claimant solicitors were banned from April 1 this year. One reason for the ‘whiplash epidemic’ is that it is cheaper to settle than to fight cases suspected to be fraudulent, say insurance experts. The scale of the scandal in England and Wales is much greater than countries like Germany, where lawyers’ claim fees are severely limited. Insurance underwriters noted: ‘It’s nothing to do with German necks being stronger than British necks.’ David Powell, manager of the Lloyd’s Market Association which manage 90 insurance underwriting syndicates told MPs that bogus claims were ‘in overdrive’ because whiplash was too easy to fake with too few checks.","Up to 90 per cent of claims are small whiplash claims for less than £20,000 .

The sole survivor of the elite firefighter team that perished battling a raging wildfire in Yarnell, Arizona last week paid tribute to his fallen brothers with a heartfelt prayer. At a memorial held Tuesday in Prescott, Arizona, Brendan McDonough took the stage in front of a packed arena of about 8,000 people to recite 'The Hotshot's Prayer.' The prayer, which was written for all Hotshot crews across the U.S., references the dangers the firefighters take when tackling fires in their early stages. Scroll down for video . The Hotshot's Prayer: Brendan McDonough, the sole-survivor of the June 30 incident that killed the other 19 members of his crew, recited a special prayer at the Tuesday memorial .

'When I am called to duty, Lord to fight the roaring blaze, please keep me safe and strong, I may be here for days.' The prayer also speaks to the constant possibility of death. 'For if this day on the line I should answer death's call, Lord, bless my hotshot crew, my family, one and all.' At the end of his recitation, McDonough's voice broke as he thanked the massive crowd gathered. 'I miss my brothers,' he said. The . memorial on Tuesday was the last of a series of vigils since the . firefighters' tragic death on June 30, battling an out of control . wildfire in Yarnell, Arizona. Family . members and politicians alike came together to honor the lives of the . nineteen firefighters whose lives were taken in the fire.

McDonough was the lone survivor of his team, because he was assigned to keep watch of the blaze. When McDonough saw that the winds were changing and driving the flames to wrap around his team, he warned the crew. Unfortunately they weren't able to escape fast enough. As a last resort, the 19 firefighters retreated to make-shift shelters. All 19 perished in what was  the largest loss of firefighters battling a wildfire in 80 years, and the most killed in a single incident since 9/11. The Granite Hotshots were an elite unit of firefighters dispatched to battle wildfire's in their early stages. There are other Hotshot teams, mostly in the Western U.S., totaling about 110 men in teams of 20. At the service, each individual firefighter was honored and their family given an American flag. Memorials were set up to honor each of the fallen. Inside the arena images of each Hotshot killed were hung with their uniforms, helmets, boots and single white rose next to each image. Outside the arena another tribute was set up with pictures of the fallen, each with an American flag of their own and purple ribbon with his name. A granite marker read: 'In honor and recognition of all wildland firefighters across this great nation. Duty - Respect - Integrity.' Speakers at the event included Vice President Joe Biden and Arizona Gov Jan Brewer. Against the backdrop of the departed's pictures, Gov . Brewer talked about the great pride she had in the men who lost their lives. 'Of course our hearts are filled with profound sadness today, but they're also filled with great pride,' Brewer said. 'How wonderful is it to know that Arizona was home to 19 men like those we honor today.' She praised the men as heroes who tragically died before their time. 'They . were protectors defending out communities, safeguarding our friends, . family and strangers alike. They were 19 heroes gone at the turn of the . wind,' she said.

Console: Two unidentified women embrace at the ceremony . Roses: A single white rose was placed next to each of the fallen firefighter's pictures . Vice President Biden spoke at the . event because he felt a bond with the men due to previous experience . with firefighters who 'saved my life.' Biden . was referencing several incidents where firefighters stepped in to aide . his family. First, in the 1972 car crash that killed his wife and . daughter. His two sons were also in the car but survived because . firefighters stepped in to break open the vehicle. 'I . don't have the privilege of knowing any of these heroes personally, but . I know them,' Biden said. 'I know them because they saved the lives of . my two sons.' Biden also . talked about how firefighters took him to the hospital when he suffered . an aneurysm in 1998, and how firefighters saved his wife Jill when . lightning struck their home. McDonough . shook hands with the president who called his fellow Hotshots 'men of . uncommon valor' while thanking God that one crew member got out alive. 'These . men were some of the strongest most disciplined, tenacious, physically . fit men in the world. An elite unit in every sense of that phrase,' Biden said. ""There's an old saying: All men are created equal, and then a few became firefighters,"" Biden said. ""Thank God for you all."" To the families of the fallen, Biden spoke about the heroism their sons, husbands and brothers showed in the face of danger.

But in a departure from his day job, Italian designer Roberto Cavalli has lent his aesthetic prowess to the motoring industry in the creation of a one-off MINI Paceman - and naturellement, it's all for charity. It was the 13th time a unique MINI has been created in honour of the Life Ball, an event that raises money to help combat AIDS and HIV. But while the other cars have raised a combined 500,000 euros for charity, this Cavalli number has singlehandedly given the coffers an incredible boost after it sold for 150,000 euros at the Life Ball last weekend. That is one pimped ride! Designer Roberto Cavalli's customised MINI Paceman sold for 150,000 euros (£128,000) at the Life Ball AIDS gala in Vienna last week . Sir Elton John, Bill Clinton, Kelly Osbourne and Hilary Swank were just a handful of the big names present at the ball, held in Vienna, Austria. The car was finished with a shimmering, iridescent paintwork that turned from black to brown depending on the angle from which it was viewed. Inside, the upholstery is quilted black leather, the steering wheel is wrapped in more leather, and trim is gold - even the vents for the air conditioning are rendered in glossy metallics.

Fuming: Mother-of-four Janet Mee suffered chipped bones in her spine after being knocked down by driver John Kershaw . A mother has described how her life has been 'ruined' after she was knocked down by a hit-and-run driver - but the man responsible has walked free from court with little more than a slap on the wrist. Janet Mee, 49, was left temporarily paralysed after chipping bones in her spine following the accident in Burnley, Lancashire. John Kershaw, 65, 'squashed' her between two cars as he drove past in his Vauxhall Insignia. Mrs Mee said she had just picked up her two children Danel, five, and Anneliese, three, from nursery when she was hurt. She still struggles to walk following the accident on December 13 last year and is not even able to play with her children. Police had to issue two please for information before Kershaw was tracked down, but he was fined just £100 as well being given a two-year conditional discharge and six penalty points by magistrates. Mrs Gee reacted to the sentence saying: 'Six points on a driving licence is a massive insult given that he drove away after hitting me in the street. 'I'm just grateful he didn't hit the children - they could have been killed after what he did.' Mrs Mee said her children were left in tears following the accident. Despite knowing he had hit Mrs Mee, Kershaw drove off with his wheels spinning. His defence lawyer told the court he thought he had seen Mrs Mee get back up and didn't feel he needed to stop. Speaking about the accident, Mrs Gee said: 'Everything . from that moment changed and I went from being buoyant and happy to . everything crumbling. The stark reality was that everything changed, I . am now a person who needs bathing and washing. 'The . bones in my back have been left chipped and I have been told that I . will never walk properly again. I can't do anything, I can't drive. 'I . even have trouble taking my socks and boots off and any garments below . the waist. It is very frustrating. I can't do day to day things the pain . is so severe. 'I want to . play with the kids but I can't, I have cried so many tears. Daniel . understands and now he brings his toys to me, he's always wanting to do . things for me and wants to make me a cup of tea. 'Once upon a time I . would be sat on the floor playing with them. This man has ruined my life.' Let off: John Kershaw, left, was given just six points on his licence and £100 fine after he knocked down mother Janet Mee, right, outside a nursery . Mrs . Mee, a mature student, was initially left paralysed from the waist down . and treated in hospital for chipped bones in her spine following the . incident. Kershaw pleaded guilty to driving without due . care and attention and failing to report a road accident. In court Miss Parveen Akhtar, prosecuting . said Kershaw stopped for two or three seconds about two car lengths . away after the impact but drove off quickly, with the wheels spinning. Kershaw's . defence lawyer David Leach told the court his client knew he had caught . Mrs Mee with his wing mirror but said he didn't see her fall to the . ground. Mr Leach said . Kershaw saw Mrs Mee on her feet after hitting her and felt he had no . reason to get out of his car and make any inquiries. The . lawyer added: 'He is not a boy racer. He is a senior citizen.

A British mother of two has been held in a 'squalid' jail in the Dominican Republic for a year without charge after she allegedly ran over her husband - whom she met while living in the country. Nicole Reyes, 37, originally from Rumney, Cardiff, was locked up last July after Jorge Quintanilla, 38, died when her Toyota SUV was said to have clipped his motorbike, which he was driving alongside. Now her mother Jeannette, 61, has written to Prime Minister David Cameron, calling on him to help get her daughter released so she can return home - one year after she was first put in custody. Death: Nicole Reyes (left), 37, originally from Cardiff, was locked up last July after Jorge Quintanilla (right), 38, died when her Toyota SUV was said to have clipped his motorbike, which he was driving alongside . Fun in the pool: Nicole Reyes is pictured with her husband Jorge Quintanilla, daughter Leah and son Luke . Without charge: Nicole Reyes is currently being held in this prison in Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic . She said in a four-page letter to Mr Cameron: ‘My daughter feels like she is being tortured every single day. I have to listen to her sobbing.’ Reyes swapped South Wales for the sands and seas of the Caribbean 10 years ago. She travelled there on holiday - but fell in love with the country and became a holiday rep with Thomas Cook. Shortly after moving to the idylic island she met Mr Quintanilla and the pair enjoyed a whirlwind romance. They moved into the resort community of Costambar near the coastal city of Puerto Plata. But their relationship ended in tragedy after he was killed when Reyes clipped his motorbike with her vehicle as they drove home from a meal out. She has been held without charge ever since. She is accused of deliberately . running him over, but Reyes claims he died when she hit his motorbike as . he swerved out of the way of an oncoming car.
