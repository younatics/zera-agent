"(CNN) -- Crushing a string of opponents before dispatching Novak Djokovic in four sets in the U.S. Open final, Rafael Nadal was back to his ruthless best, with not a hint of the injury problems which have threatened to blight his career, even during a year which has seen him claim two grand slams. But the Spaniard has admitted to CNN that he had real fears that as he made yet another comeback he would fall short of his own incredible standards. ""Sure I had doubts, everyone has doubts,"" said the 27-year-old Mallorcan. ""When you are injured you doubt if you going to be able to come back and play at 100%."" Closing fast on Djokovic's No.1 spot, Nadal has spent two lengthy spells on the sidelines through knee injuries, both times making a strong comeback. Returning to the ATP Tour in February, Nadal clicked straight into gear, culminating in his eighth victory in the French Open. But come Wimbledon his battered body could take no further punishment and Nadal was a shadow of his normal self as he crashed out in the first round to unheralded Steve Darcis, clearly troubled by knee problems. The doubters were out in force again and with Nadal sidelined yet again, Djokovic and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray were predicted to share the grand slams between them in the foreseeable future. They were reckoning without Nadal's incredible determination and joining the circuit again for the pre U.S. Open hard court series, the Mallorcan looked as if he had never been away, claiming titles in Montreal and Cincinnati before his Flushing Meadows triumph. The mixture of joy and relief were there for all to see as Nadal savored every moment on the Arthur Ashe Stadium Court in claiming his 13th career grand slam. ""When you are coming back after low moments victories are all the more special and more emotional,"" Nadal admitted. ""I enjoy it now because in a few years I won't have the chance to play like I did in the U.S. Open final."" The manner of his victory suggested that Nadal could easily outstrip all-time grand slam record holder Roger Federer, who has 17 in his trophy room. But always at the back of Nadal's mind is the possibility his knee tendon problem might flare up again so he is taking nothing for granted. ""We need our knees, without our knees it is impossible to play well, sometimes I still have pain, but the most important thing is that at the moment I am able to play without limitations,"" said the newly crowned U.S. Open champion. Nadal has been a force on the circuit for approaching a decade since bursting to prominence as a precocious teenager, particularly on his favorite clay surface. His all action game was an immediate crowd pleaser but he admits that he takes a more measured approach these days. ""When you are a kid you are able to play with a different style, crazy jumping and all that,"" added Nadal. ""That moment has passed but my love and passion for the game is still the same."" All that spells bad news for those battling him at the elite end of the men's game with plenty to play for still in 2013, including the ATP World Tour Finals in London, just about the only title which has eluded him.","Rafael Nadal won 13th grand slam title at the U.S. Open .

"(CNN) -- Football club Barcelona paid 13.5 million euros ($18.5 million) in additional taxes on Monday, while denying any fiscal ""irregularities"" in its purchase of Brazilian superstar Neymar, which is now under investigation by a court. FC Barcelona announced the surprise payment on its website, which it called ""voluntary,"" just four days after a judge at Spain's National Court in Madrid filed preliminary charges against the fan-owned club for alleged tax fraud in the Neymar deal. ""The board (of Barcelona) denies the existence of any tax-related crime in relation to the fiscal obligations arising from the signing of the player (Neymar),"" the club's website said. ""Throughout the process, the club was receiving expert advice and at every moment the club's auditor was informed and had access to all the documentation concerning the negotiations."" Last Thursday, Judge Pablo Ruz expanded his investigation against the club, as requested a day earlier by a prosecutor, who alleged the club avoided paying 9 million euros (more than $12 million) in taxes on Neymar's signing and transfer, corresponding to contracts signed in 2011 and 2013. The judge is already investigating whether a former Barcelona president committed financial irregularities in the signing of Neymar. The club said on its website Monday: ""Given the existence of a possible divergent interpretation of the exact amount of tax responsibility arising from the signing, and to defend the club's reputation and good name, FC Barcelona has this morning made a complementary tax declaration of a total of 13,550,830.56 euros."" The reason, the club added, was ""to cover any potential interpretation made concerning the contracts signed in the transfer process for Neymar, although we remain convinced that the original tax payment was in line with our fiscal obligations."" Judge Ruz said in his writ last Thursday that the investigation would include a look at an alleged ""contract simulation presumably carried out by the parties which signed the contracts."" The expanded investigation would hold FC Barcelona responsible as an entity or business enterprise if found guilty of tax fraud, said a National Court spokesman, who by custom is not identified. The judge ordered Spain's tax collection agency to examine FC Barcelona's tax filings for 2011, 2012 and 2013, the writ said. Neymar joined Barcelona in June 2013, with his father -- who doubles as his agent -- having entered into an initial contract with the Spanish giants in late 2011. Barcelona's former president, Sandro Rosell, who resigned last month after a judge agreed to investigate a lawsuit against him for alleged irregularities in the Neymar deal, has denied any wrongdoing. Ruz began the investigation last month after a legal complaint from one of the club's members. Prosecutor Jose Perals last Wednesday formally asked the judge to expand the investigation. In his writ, Perals alleges that he's ""become aware of a series of economic transactions by the club, and in favor of various companies, related to the signing of Neymar da Silva Santos Jr., based at times on simulated contracts."" The investigation originally came after season-ticket holder Jordi Cases complained that the amount paid to bring Neymar from Brazilian side Santos was more than the reported fee of 57.1 million euros. A day after Rosell resigned, the club released figures that showed that Barca actually paid 86.2 million euros for Neymar. Cases' lawyer, Felipe Izquierdo, earlier told CNN that other Barcelona executives, still working at the club after Rosell's resignation, also allegedly signed some of the contracts that brought Neymar to the club. Barcelona has told CNN that one of those signatories was former club VP, and now President, Josep Maria Bartomeu. Piers Edwards and Chris Murphy contributed to this report.","Barcelona pay $18.5m in tax four days after judge files charges for alleged tax fraud .

"(CNN) -- Written on every page of Israel's history, in ink and in blood, is the name Ariel Sharon. His life, which ended today after an eight-year coma, deeply influenced Israel's past. But even in death, Sharon will influence the future, as Israelis consider their options if the two-state solution fails. During Israel's 1948 War of Independence, the handsome blond officer, known as ""Arik,"" was shot and left for dead. He recovered and founded Israel's first commando unit, which conducted raids beyond Israel's borders. In the 1956 Sinai campaign, he led Israel's legendary paratroopers into clashes behind enemy lines. A successful general in the 1967 Six Day War, he achieved world fame six years later by spurring Israeli troops across the Suez Canal to encircle the Egyptian army in the Yom Kippur War. The image of Sharon, still blond but now stout, his head wrapped in a bloodied bandage, became iconic. His heroism was uniquely Israeli, built by breaking rules as well as orders, and by surrounding himself with controversy and myth. But Sharon's real legacy was made in politics. Here, too, he ignored the norms and forged his own often-tortuous path. He traversed the political spectrum, from the labor farm in which he grew up to the rightist Likud that he established with Menachem Begin. As agriculture minister in the late 1970s, he constructed dozens of settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, gaining a reputation as an opponent of peace. But then, as defense minister, he evicted thousands of Israelis from settlements in Sinai to fulfill Israel's treaty with Egypt. In 1982, Sharon masterminded the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, by some accounts deceiving Prime Minister Begin, and besieged Beirut. An Israeli investigation implicated Sharon in the massacre of 800 Palestinian civilians by Lebanese militiamen and compelled him to resign. I saw the two sides of Sharon, the bullheaded warrior and man of the people. I saw how Israelis were alternately repelled and captivated by him. I was stationed with the Israeli paratroopers in Beirut when we learned that Sharon wanted to visit the troops. Furious over what they regarded as a reckless war, my buddies indicated that the defense minister was unwelcome. Sharon never arrived. But weeks later, while hosting Sharon at a base inside Israel, I watched amazed as he left the table to chat with the cook, about whom he remembered every detail. Known even in Hebrew as the Bulldozer â€” as much for perseverance as girth â€” Sharon in 2000 burst into the political forefront. The Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had rejected Israel's offer of independence in all of Gaza, most of the West Bank and half of Jerusalem, and blamed Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount for igniting the Second Intifada. Through the havoc wrought by Palestinian suicide bombers, Sharon pressed into the prime minister's office with Labor's Shimon Peres as his deputy. The once-impetuous soldier became the prudent statesman as Sharon waited through months of bombings before finally striking back. In April 2002, he ordered Israeli forces to eradicate terror and restore peace to Israeli neighborhoods. Then Sharon, with characteristic audacity, pivoted toward peace. But failing to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, he decided to act unilaterally. The former champion of the settlements now proposed ""disengagement"" -- to uproot them, along with Israeli forces, from Gaza. This divided the Israeli public and drove Sharon to create his own party, which gained wide support. In 2005, the residents of all 21 Gaza settlements were evacuated. Hamas subsequently took over Gaza and fired thousands of rockets at Israel. Still, an unapologetic Sharon was about to apply his unilateralist strategy to the West Bank when he suffered a massive stroke. Today, as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry pursues a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, Sharon's approach is once again being discussed. A growing number Israelis are asking, ""What happens if the process fails?"" One solution could be a unilateral Israeli withdrawal from Palestinian population centers in the West Bank. As in the disengagement from Gaza, the United States would endorse this move, but unlike in Gaza, most Israeli settlements would remain within Israel, and Israeli troops would still patrol strategic borders. Of course, the preferable solution is two states for two peoples. But if that proves unattainable, then Israel can still end the occupation of the Palestinians, preserve its security, and perhaps lay new foundations for peace. Even when comatose, Ariel Sharon was a constant presence for Israelis. Whether as the dashing commando, the farmer, the builder, the contrarian, and belated seeker of peace, he reflected them and embodied their story. And after his death, his brazen Israeli way of action lives on. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Oren.","Michael Oren: Ariel Sharon, who died today, had pivotal, enduring effect on Israel .
He says as an Israeli warrior, he led troops in Six Day War, Yom Kippur War, gained fame .
He says in political career, he opposed peace, eventually pivoting toward it .

"(CNN) -- Americans are rightly angry that Burger King plans to use its merger with the Canadian doughnut and coffee chain Tim Hortons to claim Canadian citizenship, probably as a way to avoid paying U.S. taxes -- which the burger chain denies. But Burger King is the latest company to undergo an inversion, which happens when an American company uses a merger to reincorporate as a foreign one. Some have suggested boycotting the fast food chain, while others have directed their anger toward the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, whose company Berkshire Hathaway is partly financing the deal. Buffett is famous for arguing that our tax code should be fairer and that the rich and powerful should not get more breaks than middle-income Americans -- views that some say are incongruous with his involvement in this merger. But anger toward Warren Buffett is misdirected. He cannot close loopholes that allow Burger King to claim Canadian citizenship any more than he can close the loophole that allows him and fund managers to pay a smaller percentage of their income in taxes than their secretaries. The real culprits are members of Congress, who have failed to close these loopholes and have allowed Burger King to claim that it is becoming a foreign corporation for tax purposes even when common sense tells us it is as American as any company could be. You see, Burger King will continue to serve U.S. customers. It will not undergo much change in ownership. And it will likely continue to have its managers based in the United States. But when it's time to pay taxes, it will claim to be a newly restructured company based in Canada, which has a lower corporate tax rate. It's absurd that Congress is allowing Burger King to use paperwork to avoid supporting the very public investments â€” highways, agriculture supports, food inspections, courts â€” that make its profits possible. And just be clear on this point: Burger King probably will use this deal to avoid taxes, no matter what the company says. Defenders of these arrangements argue that profits the company makes in the United States will still be subject to U.S. taxes, but that ignores the additional loopholes that a corporation can exploit after it inverts. For example, Burger King can take on debt from the foreign company that officially owns it after inversion and then make interest payments that wipe out its U.S. income for tax purposes. This effectively shifts the profits made in the United States to a foreign country where the company will be taxed less. Of course, this is all an accounting gimmick since merged corporations like Burger King and Tim Hortons are really just one great big company, so a ""loan"" from one to the other is really like one branch of a company wiring money to another branch. But our tax rules are so poorly written that they allow this utter nonsense. It doesn't have to be this way. A proposal from President Obama would basically tell the IRS not to recognize a company like Burger King as ""foreign"" for tax purposes unless it really has become a foreign company in a real sense. This proposal has been introduced as legislation in the House and Senate, but so far a majority has not acted in either chamber. Until Congress hears from all of us outraged Americans, nothing will change, no matter what Warren Buffett does.","Robert McIntyre: Burger King's purchase of Tim Hortons means it can pay less taxes .

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- Four years after the meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, questions about the lingering physical and mental health toll of the disaster persist. The Fukushima District Court ruled Tuesday in favor of a family who filed a landmark lawsuit blaming Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), the plant operator of the crippled nuclear reactor, for the suicide of a woman in 2011. Four months after three reactors melted down at the Fukushima plant following a devastating earthquake and tsunami, Hamako Watanabe and her husband lost their home, their jobs and the prospect of restoring their lives. She doused herself in kerosene and set herself on fire after slipping into depression. Her husband, Mikio Watanabe, found her charred body. ""We lost everything,"" her widower told CNN in 2012. ""We were forced to evacuate. We lost our jobs. I lost my wife in such a terrible way. I really lost everything."" The Fukushima District Court ordered TEPCO to pay 49 million yen ($471,063 U.S.) to her family, in a ruling that found a link between the nuclear accident and Watanabe's death. ""It is well assumed that the stress caused by sudden loss of the base of her life against her will and unknown future in evacuation was unbearable for her,"" according to the court ruling. A spokeswoman of TEPCO Mayumi Yoshida said: ""We express deep condolence for the loss for Mrs. Hamako Watanabe. We will examine the ruling closely and continue to deal with it sincerely."" Fukushima residents cleared to return . Thyroid cancer cases monitored . In the wake of the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986, the local government began monitoring the health of residents who were under the age of 18 at the time of the March, 2011 incident. The Fukushima Prefectural Government found more cases of thyroid cancer, with 57 people confirmed cases and 46 others listed as possible cases, according to data released this week. The risk of thyroid cancer increases in people who've been exposed to high doses of radiation. Children are more sensitive to radiation and at risk for a longer period of time than adults, according to medical literature on thyroid cancer. The cancer rate -- 57 out of 296,026 -- is high compared to known international statistics, but it's difficult to link the nuclear accident to the rates of pediatric thyroid cancer, according to the Fukushima prefecture's health office. The high rate may be attributed to the thorough method of testing for thyroid cancer, according to the office. Hisakatsu Kotani, from the Fukushima prefectural government's health research section, said there were no patterns detected between the cases of thyroid cancers and high radiation areas. ""Experts have been saying this is not the time yet to see any health impact by the accident,"" he said. In the case of Chernobyl, thyroid cancer cases in children reached a peak about 10 years after exposure, according to a report analyzing radiation exposure and the risk of pediatric thyroid cancers. A scientific review published in 2011, found that pediatric thyroid cancers only account for 0.5 to 3% of all types of cancers. That review also found that girls have four times higher frequency for pediatric thyroid cancer than boys. Of the 104 people who were diagnosed with potentially cancerous tumors at Fukushima, 68 were females and 36 were males. More than half of them, 58, had surgery to remove the growth.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama welcomed area students and children of military families Sunday to celebrate Halloween at the White House. Joined by his wife, Michelle, the president handed out treats to the gaggles of costumed children gathered on the lawn. Neither the president nor his wife dressed up. The trick-or-treaters -- ranging in age from 6 to 14 -- were from schools in the Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia areas, the White House said. They were greeted by a boisterous brass band and by adults dressed up as quintessential Halloween characters like Dracula and Frankenstein. Participants were given M&M's, a sweet dough butter cookie and dried fruit. Fake spider webs and bats decorated the portico of the White House, while pumpkins spotted the yard. The celebration was a light-hearted break for Obama, who has been crisscrossing the country in full campaign mode ahead of Tuesday's congressional elections. At stake are all 435 House seats and 37 of the 100 Senate seats, along with almost 40 gubernatorial races. His Democratic party is poised to lose seats in both chambers, and perhaps its House majority. Speaking at a Cleveland State University rally earlier Sunday, Obama urged people to get out and vote.","Students and children of military families trick-or-treat on the president's lawn .

"Ramallah, West Bank (CNN) -- Israel released 26 Palestinian prisoners early Wednesday, part of an agreement that fueled new peace talks. The released prisoners were the second of four groups -- roughly 100 prisoners -- expected to be freed in a deal cobbled together by the United States to jump-start stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. The Palestinian Prison Authority confirmed 21 prisoners were released shortly after midnight in the West Bank and another five were released in Gaza. Families of the prisoners were on hand in the West Bank, where cheers went up as buses carrying the prisoners arrived. But the prison release has angered some Israelis, who protested outside the West Bank prison where the inmates where held before their release. Oded Karamani said he sees the release of his brother's killer as a betrayal. ""It makes me feel like I got stabbed in my back, and they turned the knife, and turned the knife,"" Karamani said. Ronen Karamani, 18, was abducted in 1990 and stabbed to death near Jerusalem. Two Palestinians were convicted in connection with his murder. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called the decision to free Palestinian prisoners one of the most difficult of his career. But many Israeli officials, including the defense minister, have said it is part of a long-term security strategy. Israel released more than two dozen Palestinian prisoners in August on the eve of new peace talks. Some of them had been held for more than 20 years. The first prisoner release came after Israel said it would forge ahead with a plan to build 900 housing units in East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians hope will be the capital of their future state. The issue of Israeli settlements derailed the last round of direct talks, in 2010, and critics of Netanyahu say building on disputed territory could derail the new talks. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas welcomed the prisoners' release, describing it as a ""day of joy."" But he warned that there would be no peace agreement with Israel until all Palestinian prisoners had been freed. ""Our true joy will not be complete until we bring everyone out of prison,"" he told Palestine TV. Salma Abdelaziz and Saad Abedine contributed to this report.","NEW: Abbas says there can be no peace deal until all prisoners have been freed .

"(CNN) -- A New York Times article has reported that the United Arab Emirates and Egypt have launched airstrikes in Libya against militias, without coordinating with their ally, the United States of America. Both Egypt and the United Arab Emirates continue to deny that they were responsible for the strikes, while American officials insist otherwise. Yet, political cover could have been fairly easily provided if Egypt and the UAE had wanted to strike with less fallout. Allegations they carried out the strikes come against backdrop of international concern over radical Islamism in Iraq and Syria, which have led to U.S. airstrikes already, in co-ordination with the Iraqi government. Some of the Libyan Islamist militias openly express sympathy for ISIS counterparts in Iraq and Syria, and a newly elected Libyan government already calling for at least some kind of international intervention to restore order, although they've stopped short of openly calling for military strikes. Any airstrikes, however, taking place without the consent of the national government of a country, could only be described as violating state sovereignty. Of course, the Libyan state has been characterized as close to, if not already in the throes of, complete failure for the last three years. The Gadhafi regime over three decades ensured there was no state to speak of, but only institutions closely associated with him and his coterie. When he fell, the revolutionary forces had the awesome challenge of building a state where there had been none -- and in the past three years, they have been unable to succeed in accomplishing that fundamental goal. In the midst of that void, different groups have tried to acquire as much power on Libyan territory as possible. It is difficult to describe the differences in simple terms -- there are regional and tribal divides, as well as support for Islamist militants and conservative, non-secularist but also non-Islamist, opposition to them. Secularist groups, unlike in Tunisia, for example, do not particularly exist in Libya -- Libyan society at large is tremendously religiously conservative. Some of that conservatism expresses itself in support for Islamist groups that range from the Libyan chapter of the Muslim Brotherhood, and more extreme groupings like Ansar al-Sharia who have articulated sympathy for ISIS. Representatives of non-Islamist groups swept recent parliamentary elections, which indicate they have substantially more popularity than the pro-Islamist camp at present. Unfortunately, both Islamists and non-Islamists alike have given rise to militias, which only deepens the difficulty for taking Libya through its transition to democracy. The void of a popularly supported state has also made it easier for outside powers to engage in Libyan affairs. From early on in the Libyan uprising, Qatar and Turkey have built alliances and provided support for particular groupings within the country -- and the Emiratis and others did the same. Three years on, the country remains tremendously unstable -- but it now exists in a region where a truly radical Islamist movement has shown itself capable, if only temporarily, taking control of swathes of Iraq and Syria. The fears of a similar movement taking over Libya are genuinely felt in Cairo, Abu Dhabi and elsewhere in the region -- and after the U.S. engaged so openly in striking against a radical Islamist movement in Iraq, it would perhaps be unsurprising if others in the region had felt they were within their rights to do the same in Libya. There is another aspect, however, to American involvement in the region. On the one hand, American airstrikes in Iraq may have emboldened advocates of a more interventionist approach in Libya. On the other hand, American non-involvement in Syria, which arguably contributed to the rise of ISIS, may have done the same -- providing support for the narrative that if you leave radical Islamists alone, they're likely to develop into far more powerful actors as ISIS has become. U.S. influence . The rising of the stakes of the conflict in Libya may not necessarily signal a waning of American influence -- if Washington wanted to engage more forcefully in the region, either unilaterally and multilaterally, it possesses enough political capital in the region to do so. In the absence of political will to proceed in that fashion, others will step into the vacuum -- and others have. Since at least 2012, Qatar and Turkey have consistently supported Islamist groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood and their allies in countries like Egypt, Libya, Syria and elsewhere. The UAE and Saudi led the charge in supporting non-Islamist groups, although at times there was common cause, such as against Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria. They were joined by Egypt after the military removal of Mohamed Morsy in 2013, and most other Arab governments after that point seem to have either tacitly or openly joined the non-Islamist axis. Much of this has less to do with ideology than it appears, and more to do with the fear of any type of change from the status quo that could devolve into mass instability. At present, that fear is most associated with Islamist movements. Mideast polarization . What needs to happen in Libya is perhaps what needs to happen, in another fashion, across the Middle East. The polarization of the region into these two camps has taken place at the worst of times -- when the region is facing some of its greatest challenges in decades. The polarization between these two sides has repercussions and consequences, which are likely to take a very deep toll in countries like Libya, but also elsewhere, in terms of blood and chaos. It has never been more important than for these two camps to work together, as much as possible, to support Libya's newly elected government, and to use their combined influence and capital to reinforce a political process in Libya that does not rely on the use of arms. Unfortunately, that does not seem to be likely in the interim -- and it will be the Libyan people, who have already suffered so much in the past three years, who will pay the price. The effects of Gadhafi's rule still haunt them.","The New York Times reports the UAE and Egypt launched air strikes in Libya .

"(CNN) -- Efforts to forge lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians apparently suffered more setbacks Wednesday, even as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was in the Middle East trying to help mend relations. Kerry met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem, where the top U.S. diplomat acknowledged both sides of the strife. ""Israel deserves security, deserves to live in peace,"" Kerry said. ""The Palestinians deserve a state, deserve to live in peace, and that is what we are working towards."" But Netanyahu said that while Israel wants peace with Palestinians, ""I'm concerned about their progress because I see the Palestinians continuing with incitements, continuing to create artificial crises, continuing to avoid and run away from the historic decisions that are needed to make a genuine peace."" But Palestinians had their own complaints. A Palestinian source close to the peace talks said there is a ""deep crisis between the Palestinians and the Israeli negotiations team."" The source said the rift involves the ongoing construction of thousands of Israeli settlement units in the West Bank and Jerusalem as well as claims by Israel that Palestinians had agreed for Israel to continue construction in return for Israel freeing Palestinian prisoners. ""These are grave, wrongful and serious accusations by Israel, and Israel should stop its media incitement,"" the source said. ""All settlements are illegal in the West Bank and Jerusalem."" $75 million from U.S. After his stop in Jerusalem, Kerry traveled to Bethlehem and announced an additional $75 million in aid for the Palestinian Authority's High Impact Micro-Infrastructure Initiative, the U.S. State Department said. That brings the total U.S. contribution to $100 million. Germany has also pledged over $10 million to HIMII projects in the West Bank, the State Department said. ""HIMII projects will create jobs and fund infrastructure projects throughout the West Bank including the construction and repair of health clinics, roads, water systems, community centers, and schools,"" the department said. ""The United States views the economic track as a vital complement to the ongoing direct final status negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians."" Israel release Palestinian prisoners amid protests . Former Israeli official acquitted . In yet another development Wednesday, former Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman was acquitted of corruption-related charges. Israel's Ministry of Justice announced last December that he would be charged with breach of trust and fraud. Liberman announced his resignation the next day. Prosecutors said Liberman pushed to get the Israeli ambassador to Belarus posted to another country after the diplomat allegedly handed over confidential information that included details of a secret police inquiry about Liberman. But Liberman has insisted he has not violated any laws. Since Liberman's resignation, Netanyahu has been holding his post open for him. ""I congratulate you on your unanimous acquittal and am pleased that you are returning to the government,"" Netanyahu told Liberman on Wednesday, according to the foreign minister's office. But before Liberman can return to the Foreign Ministry, the government has to vote on his nomination. Liberman has faced international criticism for his hard-line stance on Israel's Arab minorities. His ultra-nationalist party is especially popular with immigrants from the former Soviet Union, where he was born and raised. Iran talks: Do we want a deal or a war?

"(CNN) -- Wednesday's release of audio recordings of the 911 calls from the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings forced news organizations to make difficult -- and sometimes unpopular -- decisions about what to broadcast and what to hold back. News executives said they were considering both the wishes of the community where the school was located -- Newtown, Connecticut -- and the journalistic impulse to report on one of the biggest news stories of the past year. The recordings were made available to news organizations Wednesday afternoon. CNN aired portions of the recordings in a report Thursday evening, including a 911 call from the school's secretary. The report was also posted online. The network's report, preceded by anchor Jake Tapper's warning of disturbing content, also included a call from a teacher who had been shot in the foot and one from a janitor who relayed information between police and dispatchers. Immediately after the airing, a CNN legal analyst said the decision to air the recordings was wrong. ""Other than pure titillation, I don't see any public interest served by this whatsoever,"" Mark Geragos said. One of CNN's competitors, Fox News Channel, also televised some audio clips about an hour after the tapes were released. Fox anchor Shepard Smith told viewers the network would ""not be airing the most gut-wrenching moments."" CBS said it would use some audio clips, but would not present all of the material or anything including gunshot sounds. ABC and NBC decided not to broadcast or post any of the recordings, but said they would report on the contents. In an internal e-mail to staffers, NBC said that ""it is fine for all programs and the website to report on the controversy related to the release of the tapes and include quotes or information from the tapes, but without audio."" Of course, in the digital age, the 911 tapes are accessible to anyone with an Internet connection. A number of news publishers that linked to the audio, including BuzzFeed, incorporated warnings that the audio included ""disturbing content."" Many reporters and media analysts said the tapes were inherently newsworthy, but acknowledged that the calls from the school were emotionally wrenching to hear, particularly for people with ties to the shooting. One Newtown official, Board of Selectmen member Patricia Llodra, said Wednesday morning that the release of the tapes ""will create a new layer of pain for many in the Newtown community."" Newtown school shooting 911 calls must be released, judge rules . Balancing act . While often criticized for using 911 tapes to exploit human tragedy, news organizations have an obligation to fight for the release of documents and records that can serve important public ends, such as disclosing improper conduct by authorities or insufficient response to emergencies or other issues, said Al Tompkins, senior faculty member for broadcast and online journalism at the Poynter Institute, a journalism think tank. Tompkins said Wednesday that editors had to listen to the recordings and decide whether the news value was sufficient to warrant using them. ""The ethical place to be is to listen and to make your decision on two things,"" he said. ""What is your journalism value in using or not using these things, and two, would the good from using them outweigh the harm?"" Emergency calls can often prove newsworthy, Tompkins said, as in the case of the Trayvon Martin shooting, in which a struggle and the fatal shot could be heard in the background of one call. CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said Wednesday, after CNN aired the clips, that he probably would have opted not to use the recordings, but said their release by the judge was the correct decision. ""I'm not sure how much this adds to the overall story, but I definitely think this is a decision for journalists to make, not for the government to make, about what gets broadcast and what doesn't,"" he said.

She continued, ""Imagine yourself as a parent of a child who was killed, or a family member of one of the six educators. Imagine yourself as a teacher or staff member in that building desperate to save the lives of children. Imagine you are the parent of a child who was able to escape.

"(CNN) -- A camera pans slowly over a row of children partly under a sheet, their eyes closed, their skin looking sallow. A man behind them, crazy with anger, shouts, ""Stop lying to us! Stop lying! Where did all these children go? Where is this regime ... that is killing us? ""Chemical weapons,"" he screams, holding his head. ""We were hit with chemical weapons!"" Inside a medical area, it's chaos. Footage shows people carrying limp bodies, some haphazardly covered in sheets, others splayed, nearly nude, on the floor. A man is on his back, staring blankly upward, his chest convulsing violently. Others hold tissues to their mouth, appearing to gag. These were some of the videos posted online that opposition activists in Syria say show that the government has used chemical weapons in the countryside outside its capital Damascus. The allegations come as a U.N. group arrived in Syria this week to determine whether either side in the conflict is using chemical weapons. Hours after the videos were reported on across international news, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's spokesperson issued a statement saying that he was ""shocked"" by the reports. The U.N. mission is ""fully engaged in the investigation process"" and the team, which began work Monday, ""is in discussions"" with the Syrian government,"" the statement read. ""The Secretary-General reiterates that any use of chemical weapons by any side under any circumstances would violate international humanitarian law."" Syrian activists have been pushing since March 2011 to oust President Bashar al-Assad. CNN could not immediately verify where or when the videos were recorded, and could not authenticate the number killed or injured. The war has killed more than 100,000 people and displaced millions, according to the United Nations. There have been repeated allegations that chemical weapons were being used during the course of the conflict. On Wednesday Al-Assad's government denied the allegations, calling them ""completely baseless"" on Syria's state-run media. Initially Syrian opposition groups claimed that hundreds were killed Wednesday, but as the day wore on, the number went up -- more than 1,300 people, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees and the Syrian National Council. The council is an umbrella group of anti-regime activists. A senior Obama administration official said the United States had no official confirmation that chemical weapons were used in recent attacks in Syria. ""If true, it would be further evidence of unconscionable brutality by a desperate man and a desperate regime,"" the official said. The White House released a statement about the allegations saying that the U.S. is ""deeply concerned by reports"" that chemical weapons were used"" and that officials are ""working urgently to gather additional information."" ""The United States strongly condemns any and all use of chemical weapons,"" it reads. ""Those responsible for the use of chemical weapons must be held accountable. Today, we are formally requesting that the United Nations urgently investigate this new allegation."" The U.S. urged that the U.N. team be given ""immediate access to witnesses and affected individuals, and have the ability to examine and collect physical evidence without any interference or manipulation from the Syrian government. ""If the Syrian government has nothing to hide and is truly committed to an impartial and credible investigation of chemical weapons use in Syria, it will facilitate the UN team's immediate and unfettered access to this site."" ""We are aware of the reports (of chemical weapons), and we are trying to find out more,"" U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky said Wednesday. The alleged attacks took place in eastern and western Ghouta, rebel strongholds that the regime has been desperately trying to take back for more than a year. They don't want rebels pushing into the capital. ""The inspectors will not come,"" said a resident who didn't want his name used. ""If they wanted to come, they would have come a long time ago. ""The Assad regime determines where the inspectors go, and they will not let them go there. There is already a siege around eastern Ghouta from the Assad regime."" Syria strikes refugee camp in northern Lebanon . Russian officials, meanwhile, dismissed the claims of chemical weapons as a ""provocation planned in advance,"" Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich told Interfax news agency. ""The fact that agenda-driven regional mass media have begun an aggressive attack at once, as if on command, laying all the responsibility on the government, draws attention,"" the reports quotes Lukashevich saying in a statement Wednesday. ""The fact that the criminal action near Damascus was carried out just when the mission of UN experts to investigate the statements on possible chemical weapons use there has successfully begun its work in Syria points to this,"" according to the report. Hundreds reported dead . The injured started streaming in shortly after predawn prayers, said Dr. Abu Said at a field hospital in Sakba, east of Damascus. Forty of the 200 people brought to the field hospital died, Said said. A man who referred to himself as a volunteer first responder, Abu Gazi, said he heard rockets unlike any he'd heard before. He went to Zamalka, the closest area to him that was hit. Over a few hours, his vision blurred, and eventually he lost vision and felt paralyzed, he said. Abu Gazi said he was with a doctor at a field hospital in Arbeen who reported 300 people dead and 500 wounded. The symptoms, he said, included unconsciousness, foaming from the nose and mouth, constricted pupils, fast heartbeat and difficulty breathing. People died of asphyxiation, he said. Bashar al-Assad is all smiles on his new Instagram account . Countries express concern . British Foreign Secretary William Hague called on the Syrian government to give access to the U.N. team. ""I am deeply concerned by reports that hundreds of people, including children, have been killed in airstrikes and a chemical weapons attack on rebel-held areas near Damascus,"" he said. ""These reports are uncorroborated and we are urgently seeking more information. But it is clear that if they are verified, it would mark a shocking escalation in the use of chemical weapons in Syria."" The French Foreign Ministry said it didn't have independent confirmation that an attack took place as rebels claim, but it said those responsible for the alleged chemical weapons attack ""will be held accountable."" ""France also calls for light to be shed on the alleged use of chemical weapons in the attacks,"" the ministry said. In denying the use of chemical weapons, a Syrian government spokesman said the reports were an ""attempt to divert the U.N. chemical weapons investigation commission away from carrying out its duties,"" the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported. Separately, Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi was quoted by SANA as saying that the government did not and would not use such weapons -- in the case they even exist. ""Everything that has been said is absurd, primitive, illogical and fabricated,"" he said on state TV. ""What we say is what we mean: there is no use of such things (chemical weapons) at all, at least not by the Syrian army or the Syrian state, and it's easy to prove and it is not that complicated."" Chemical weapons frightful, relatively inexpensive . Fingerpointing on both sides . In June, the White House said al-Assad's forces had crossed a ""red line"" by using chemical weapons, including the nerve agent sarin gas, against rebel forces. This prompted the U.S. government to begin providing military support to opposition fighters, despite its earlier reluctance. Syria's government, meanwhile, has claimed rebel fighters have used chemical weapons as well. That includes a March incident in Khan al-Asal in the northern province of Aleppo, according to state media. Opposition officials have said rebels don't have access to chemical weapons or the missiles needed to use them in an attack, while other rebel leaders said Syrian troops fired ""chemical rockets"" at civilians and opposition forces. The government has agreed to arrangements ""essential for cooperation to ensure the proper, safe and efficient conduct of the mission,"" the U.N. secretary-general's office said last week. Khan al-Asal will be one of the three incidents that U.N. inspectors will look into, a U.N. official said in late July. The opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights called on Ban on Wednesday ""to apply all pressure within his powers to pressure the Syrian regime,"" according to a statement on Facebook. ""We assure the world that silence and inaction in the face of such gross and large-scale war crimes, committed in this instance by the Syrian regime, will only embolden the criminals to continue in this path. The international community is thus complicit in these crimes because of its polirazation, silence and inability to work on a settlement that would lead to the end of the daily bloodshed in Syria,"" it said.

"(CNN) -- While the sporting world awaits confirmation of his mega-money new sponsorship deal with Nike, Rory McIlroy has deflected attention to one of the other big stories on golf's horizon this week -- the naming of the next European Ryder Cup captain. The world No. 1 was part of last year's winning team, famously triumphing in his final-day singles match after needing a police escort to get to the Medinah course on time. Jose Maria Olazabal stood down after guiding the Europeans to a remarkable come-from-behind win over the U.S. -- and his assistants Darren Clarke and Paul McGinley were initially frontrunners for the 2014 role at Gleneagles in Scotland. However, that changed when the Americans turned once again to Tom Watson, the last U.S. captain to triumph on European soil in 1993 and who won four of his eight major titles at Scottish links courses. Since then Colin Montgomerie has been widely tipped to repeat his 2010 role, when Europe won at Celtic Manor, and the eight-time European Tour money list winner confirmed last week that he would be interested in the leading the team in his home country. ""I thought it was between Darren and Paul until Darren said something, then my name was mentioned,"" Montgomerie said ahead of the Volvo Champions event in South Africa, where he finished 18 shots behind Sunday's victor Louis Oosthuizen. ""I've never canvassed, as I didn't last time. I've not spoken to anybody about this. But I've always felt that if I was asked I would do it and that's still the case."" However, McIlroy -- who played under Montgomerie -- has firm opinions about who should be captain. ""Ryder Cup captaincy should be a 1-time thing,"" the Northern Irishman said on his Twitter page. ""Everybody deserving gets their chance and moves on. Would love to play under Paul McGinley in '14."" Bernard Gallacher, the last man to captain Europe more than once, agreed that Montgomerie should not return. ""Colin said himself, when he was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame, he intends to compete on the American seniors tour the moment he turns 50 this summer,"" the 63-year-old, who was skipper in 1991, '93 and '95, told the Scottish Daily Record newspaper. ""So he will very quickly become out of touch with the players on the main tour. What message would that send to the other worthy candidates who are queuing up for the job, having earned their right to the captaincy just as much as Colin?"" Paul Lawrie, who tied for seventh at Durban Country Club on Sunday, has also spoken out against the chances of his compatriot Montgomerie. ""He's had his go. One time job for me,"" the 1999 British Open champion wrote on Twitter. However, fellow professional Henrik Stenson, who was on the committee that first appointed Montgomerie, said the 49-year-old might yet be picked again on Tuesday in Abu Dhabi. ""No-one would question his passion for the Ryder Cup and the effort he put into the captaincy in 2010 and I am sure he would do the same and maybe more this time around if he was to be asked. So that might be a possible scenario,"" the Swede told the Scotsman newspaper. Olazabal, who finished joint last in the 33-man Volvo Champions tournament, said he would not be interested in taking the job again. ""First of all it's a lot of energy and time, a huge demand and the pressure is quite big,"" the Spaniard told the UK Press Association. ""Even if it was held in Spain again somewhere down the line I wouldn't do it. Monty has also done it and was successful too. If I was him I wouldn't do it again, but Monty is his own man. ""I am a strong believer that we have a generation of players that deserve the captaincy -- and some might miss out because there are just too many. I think it's right to give those guys a chance."" Read : Colsaerts' driving length stuns rivals . The debate, which comes ahead of this week's Abu Dhabi Championship featuring McIlroy and Tiger Woods, has taken some of the attention off Oosthuizen's remarkable come-from-behind victory in Durban. The South African has risen to a career-high fourth in the world rankings after wiping out Scott Jamieson's five-shot lead within the first 11 holes of the final round. The 2010 British Open champion shot six-under-par 66 to win by one stroke, denying the Scot his second win in the city in the space of a month. It was his sixth victory on the European Tour, lifting him up to second in the Race to Dubai standings behind world No. 100 Jamieson, and his seventh top-10 finish in his last eight starts. ""It's a great start to the year, I knew I had to come out and get my name up there,"" the 30-year-old said. Jamieson, who won the Nelson Mandela Championship in December to qualify for the limited field, almost forced a playoff when his eagle chip attempt at the last hole stopped just short of the hole. ""Louis's a major champion -- there's no shame in losing to him,"" the 29-year-old said. Meanwhile, rookies Russell Henley and Scott Langley took a three-shot lead into the final round of the PGA Tour's Sony Open in Hawaii on Sunday. The Americans were being chased by South African Tim Clark, while another newcomer -- Australian Scott Gardiner -- was tied for fourth with U.S. tour stalwart Charles Howell.","Rory McIlroy says Colin Montgomerie should not return as European Ryder Cup captain .

"San Sebastian de los Reyes, Spain (CNN) -- Just weeks after a Chicago writer known as a veteran, expert bull runner was badly gored in Pamplona, he's back at other smaller bull runnings in Spain, but walking with a cane. ""I really didn't think he was gonna gore me until it happened. I really thought I was going to find a way to escape,"" said Bill Hillmann, who helped write a book, ""Fiesta, How to Survive the Bulls of Pamplona,"" shortly before a bull's horn tore into his right thigh. That was July 9, the third day of Pamplona's historic, annual eight consecutive days of running, which Hillmann says he's run daily for numerous years. A bull got separated from the other five bulls toward the end of the 850-meter (half-mile) course. Hillmann was trying to help lead the lone bull toward the nearby bullring, but says he was pushed from behind, tripped and fell. ""I've learned from this. I'll always be much more worried about who's behind me 'cause now I know, if I'm not aware of there being first timers behind me or inexperienced guys, it could be me gored,"" said Hillmann, who turned 33 this month. He's facing a â‚¬9,000 (nearly $12,000) bill for hospital services in Pamplona, but is undaunted and is finishing a new book on how running with the bulls has changed his life. ""I wasn't sure how I was going to end the book, but now I'm pretty sure the ending is going to be the goring,"" he said. Expert American bull runner gored in Pamplona . Running with bulls 'tradition' not cruelty . Pamplona's running of the bulls dates back centuries and became world famous thanks to novelist Ernest Hemingway. But numerous other Spanish towns hold their own bull running each year, and Hillman arrived this week in San Sebastian de los Reyes, near Madrid, for its running. In these towns, he tends to catch up with with a small group of other traveling men -- Spaniards and foreigners -- who have become regular, serial bull runners. Hillmann brushes off criticism that the running of the bulls is animal cruelty. ""I don't see anything cruel about it,"" he insists. ""The animals, they're just running. They don't get hurt in any way during the run."" But they do tend to get killed in bullfights later that day. Surviving Pamplona's running of the bulls . Yet Hillmann points to the old traditions involving the bull-running events. ""I think it's fun, it's exciting,"" Hillmann said of the running. ""I think it's stupid for people who know nothing about a tradition to judge someone who knows a lot about it and who loves it."" In San Sebastian de los Reyes, a group of Englishman proudly completed their first-ever bull running, and came across Hillmann, who was asked to pull up his right pants leg to show his hefty scar. They asked if Hillmann would keep running and he said yes, although he doesn't expect that to be until next summer, after he's fully healed. ""I need to build up my courage again,"" he said, earlier in the day. ""It's gotten a lot scarier now that I know exactly how dangerous it is, now that it's a reality."" After reviewing video and photos on a laptop computer of the day he was gored, Hillmann grimaced, and said, ""Of course it was worth it. I knew the day I would get gored was coming. I was hoping I'd survive. ""I was hoping it wouldn't stop me from continuing to run, and I was lucky enough to survive and it looks like I'm going to be able to run again.""

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Department of Homeland Security expects ""threats of retaliation"" from al Qaeda in the aftermath of Osama bin Laden's death, a department official told CNN early Monday. ""We certainly anticipate threats of retaliation -- this is an organization that declared war on the United States more than a decade ago. Threats from al Qaeda are not a new phenomenon,"" the official said. The United States put American diplomatic facilities around the world on high alert and issued a global travel warning for Americans shortly after President Barack Obama announced that the terrorist leader had been killed in Pakistan by U.S. special operations forces. ""Given the uncertainty and volatility of the current situation, U.S. citizens in areas where recent events could cause anti-American violence are strongly urged to limit their travel outside of their homes and hotels and avoid mass gatherings and demonstrations,"" the State Department said in a worldwide travel warning issued early Monday.  ""U.S. citizens should stay current with media coverage of local events and be aware of their surroundings at all times."" The federal government remained at a ""heightened state of vigilance,"" but the Department of Homeland Security has no plans to raise the national terrorism threat level, Secretary Janet Napolitano said. ""I have been clear since announcing NTAS (National Terrorism Advisory System) in January that we will only issue alerts when we have specific or credible information to convey to the American public,"" she said in a written statement, which also acknowledged the likelihood of an ""evolving threat picture both in the coming days and beyond."" At the U.S. Capitol, ""there have been increased foot patrols, exterior building checks and the strategic placement of personnel, all cautionary while the intelligence community measures the possibility of anti-American response,"" Senate Sergeant at Arms Terry Gainer said via e-mail. ""There are no present indications of problems."" A law enforcement official says a joint FBI-Homeland Security advisory went out to state and local law enforcement entities Sunday night. The official said the advisory is an effort to urge law enforcement to be on the watch for possible retaliation.  But there is no specific threat information. The official said the advisory stresses to be on the lookout for any homegrown plots. The official said the heads of all the FBI field offices have also been told to ""keep in mind the significance of the news"" about bin Laden and watch out for any possible activity in their regions. The official said this means if they have open terrorism-related investigations that they should pursue interviews and other leads. The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan, and its consulates in Lahore, Karachi and Peshawar were closed Monday to routine business, the embassy said in a statement. The embassy warned U.S. citizens ""of the possibility of violent protests and demonstrations in major cities of Pakistan,"" specifically near the embassy or consulates, or areas where Westerners are known to congregate. In London, British Foreign Secretary William Hague ordered his nation's embassies to review their security, saying this is usual procedure in such situations, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said. Egypt stepped up security for all flights out of the country, said Sameh Hefny, head of the country's Aviation Authority. Israeli police have increased patrols around U.S. facilities and are prepared to implement heightened security measures in the event of demonstrations around U.S. diplomatic facilities, according to spokesman Micky Rosenfeld. Interpol, the international police organization, urged law enforcement agencies in its 188 member countries to be on ""full alert"" for retaliatory acts, Secretary General Ronald K. Noble said. Local U.S. authorities also took precautions. Washington's public transit operator, the Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, increased the number of uniformed officers patrolling the system, said Metro spokeswoman Lisa Farbstein. In New York, where al Qaeda used a pair of hijacked commercial jetliners to take down the twin towers of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said it was increasing police presence at all its facilities, including the site where the World Trade Center once stood, according to Chris Ward, executive director. Both Farbstein and Ward said the steps were precautionary measures and not related to any specific threat. Elizabeth Glazer, the deputy secretary of public safety for the state of New York, said all state agencies had been briefed on bin Laden's death and the possible ramifications. ""The public should rest assured that we are taking appropriate precautions and increasing our alertness,"" she said. New York's police department was also on guard. Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said there was no information to indicate a threat to the city, but ""members of the service are reminded to remain alert."" Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the killing had not led to specific new threats. ""As of now I am happy to say there are no new immediate threats against our city,"" he said during statements at the site of the attacks on the World Trade Center. ""But there is no doubt that we remain a top target and the killing of bin Laden will not change that."" The Philadelphia Police Department said it was doing hourly checks on mosques and synagogues. On the West Coast, Los Angeles Council President Eric Garcetti said, ""People are scared, people are afraid, people are worried that something is  going to happen now that Osama has been killed. "" But he added, ""We want to reassure folks today that this is a safe  city made safe by the vigilance of all people."" Authorities  urged citizens to report any suspicious activity or  behavior in the days and  weeks ahead to but refrain from reporting  suspicious-looking  people. ""Our real counterterrorism strength  came from our partnership with the Muslim communities; we need to continue our  vigilance,"" said Los Angeles Police Deputy Chief Michael Downing. The SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors online jihadist activities, said vague threats were posted on the Shumukh al-Islam forum, the exclusive outlet for official al Qaeda messages. ""America will reap the same if the news is true and false,"" said one posting on the website.  ""The lions will remain lions and will continue moving in the footsteps of Osama,"" said another. Adding to the concern is a Defense Department report released last week by the WikiLeaks website that a Guantanamo detainee had knowledge of al Qaeda possibly possessing a nuclear bomb somewhere in Europe. The detainee, Abu al-Libi, said he was told by al Qaeda associate Sharif al-Masri that he believed if bin Laden were captured or killed ""the bomb would be detonated"" in the United States. Al-Libi said al-Masri told him during the summer of 2004 that the terrorist network was having difficulty moving the bomb, but if it could move it ""al Qaeda would find operatives to use it."" CNN's Jill Dougherty, Kim Hutcherson, Jeanne Meserve, Susan Candiotti, Dana Bash and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","Israel increases security around U.S. facilities .

"(CNN) -- Joseph Wood gasped and struggled to breathe during his nearly two-hour execution involving a novel combination of drugs, some witnesses say. His last breaths were like ""a fish on shore gulping for air,"" reporter Troy Hayden said. Wood's attorneys tried to stop the execution more than halfway through, with one calling it ""bungled"" and ""botched."" State officials and his victims' relatives disagreed, saying Wood snored and didn't appear to suffer. Reports that the execution was botched are ""erroneous,"" Charles Ryan, director of the Arizona Department of Corrections, said Thursday. Wood was comatose and never in pain during his execution, Ryan said. The director said: ""The record clearly shows the inmate was fully and deeply sedated ... three minutes after the administration of the execution drugs."" Suffering or not, Wood's death Wednesday afternoon took too long, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said, and she has ordered the state's Department of Corrections to review it. Wood's slow death is fueling a debate stirred up as states look for new drug combinations for lethal injections, thanks in part to pharmaceutical companies' decisions to withhold or stop making drugs used in the past. ""It took Joseph Wood two hours to die, and he gasped and struggled to breathe for about an hour and 40 minutes. We will renew our efforts to get information about the manufacturer of drugs as well as how Arizona came up with the experimental formula of drugs it used today,"" attorney Dale Baich said in a statement. He added, ""Arizona appears to have joined several other states who have been responsible for an entirely preventable horror -- a bungled execution."" One of the victims' relatives had a strongly different view -- that he didn't suffer, and that he got what he deserved. ""I don't believe he was gasping for air; I don't believe he was suffering. It sounded to me like was snoring,"" said the relative, Jeanne Brown. ""You don't know what excruciating is. What's excruciating is seeing your dad laying there in a pool of blood, seeing your sister laying there in a pool of blood. This man deserved it. And I shouldn't really call him a man,"" she said. The state used midazolam, an anesthetic, and hydromorphone, a narcotic painkiller that, with an overdose, halts breathing and stops the heart from beating. It's one of the new combinations that states have tried -- with some controversial results -- after manufacturers based or operating in Europe stopped U.S. prisons from using their drugs in executions. Opinion: I was 17, on death row -- and innocent . The execution began at 1:52 p.m. (4:52 p.m. ET) Wednesday and concluded, with Wood being pronounced dead, at 3:49 p.m. (6:49 p.m. ET). Wood, convicted of murder and assault in the 1989 deaths of his estranged girlfriend and her father, objected to the drug combination in courts, arguing that it was experimental, that it would not put him out completely and that it would violate constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment. The Arizona Supreme Court briefly delayed Wednesday's execution to consider his last-ditch request before denying it. The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to intervene. Arizona execution raises questions over novel lethal injections . A federal judge ordered local officials to preserve all physical evidence in Wood's execution. ""One thing is certain, however: Inmate Wood died in a lawful manner and by eyewitness and medical accounts he did not suffer,"" the governor said. ""This is in stark comparison to the gruesome, vicious suffering that he inflicted on his two victims -- and the lifetime of suffering he has caused their family."" Lawyers rush to save him after injection . The Corrections Department said it followed protocol, affirming Wood's ""deep sedation"" seven times before he was pronounced dead. Aside from snoring, he did not grimace or otherwise move, the department said. But as the clock ticked, Wood's attorneys filed an emergency motion to stop the execution and save his life. He was ""gasping and snorting for more than an hour,"" they said. ""He is still alive,"" the motion read. ""This execution has violated Mr. Wood's Eighth Amendment right to be executed in the absence of cruel and unusual punishment."" Attorney Baich said the room was silent as Wood gasped. ""I have witnessed 10 executions, and I had never seen that before,"" he said. Baich blasted Brewer over her assessment and called for an independent investigation. Witness: Execution 'was tough for everybody' Michael Kiefer, a reporter for The Arizona Republic, said this execution was unlike the other four he has witnessed. ""Usually it takes about 10 minutes, the person goes to sleep. This was not that,"" he told other reporters afterward. ""It started off looking as if it was going all right but then obviously something didn't go right. It took two hours."" Kiefer described the sound Wood made as a ""deep, snoring, sucking air sound."" Hayden, a media witness from KSAZ-TV in Phoenix, told reporters the execution was difficult to watch. He likened Wood's breathing to a ""fish gulping for air."" ""It was tough for everybody in that room,"" he said. Opinion: 5 ways to improve the U.S. death penalty . Drug combination controversy . As with executions in other states with new lethal drug combinations, many of the objections have centered on the drugs themselves. Defense attorney Baich vowed to look into how Arizona came up with the ""experimental formula of drugs it used."" The American Civil Liberties Union joined in his outrage. ""It's time for Arizona and the other states still using lethal injection to admit that this experiment with unreliable drugs is a failure,"" it said in a statement. It called for Arizona and other states to prove the reliability of the drugs or stop the executions. Some drugs hard to come by now . The quarrel over the drugs used in lethal injections is not new. Executions have commonly been carried out with a combination of three drugs -- an anesthetic to render the inmate unconscious, followed by a paralyzing agent to keep him or her from flailing, then a third drug to kill the inmate, often potassium chloride to halt the heart. The commonly used anesthetic was once sodium thiopental, which can also be used for surgical anesthesia. Its sole U.S. manufacturer, Hospira, based in Illinois, suspended its production in 2009 and ended it for good in 2011. The company said it had never intended it to be used in lethal injections. European manufacturers of the same drug refuse to export it to the United States for the same reason. Some states then looked to pentobarbital, a powerful anesthetic commonly used to euthanize animals. But that drug has been hard to come by since 2011, when Lundbeck, its Denmark-based manufacturer, said it would do its best to keep the drug from U.S. execution programs. Controversies in Oklahoma, Ohio . New drug combinations were a focus of controversial executions this year in Oklahoma and Ohio. Oklahoma put executions on hold after the death of inmate Clayton Lockett in April. Midazolam was part of the injection combination, and it took 43 minutes for him to die, Oklahoma officials said. While state officials said Lockett was unconscious the entire time, a media witness for CNN affiliate KFOR-TV in Oklahoma City said he uttered the words, ""Man,"" ""I'm not,"" and ""something's wrong"" before blinds to the execution chamber were closed. His attorney, Dean Sanderford, said the inmate's body twitched and convulsed before he died. The state Department of Corrections said an ""exploded"" vein was part of the problem. ""There was some concern at that time that the drugs were not having the effect. So the doctor observed the line and determined that the line had blown,"" said Robert Patton, director of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. In January, Ohio used a midazolam-hydromorphone combination to execute convicted murderer and rapist Dennis McGuire. It took 24 minutes for him to die, and he appeared to gasp and convulse for 10 to 13 minutes, Columbus Dispatch reporter Alan Johnson said. Ohio's correction department said it had wanted to use pentobarbital, but it ran out of its supply in September. Combining new drugs in lethal injections may have sparked controversy, but the use of the old drug combination that included sodium thiopental was also not fail-safe, medical critics have said. It is possible that executions were quicker and inmates flailed less with the old combination, but they may have been conscious as they experienced their executions, some critics say. The real question to some is not if a specific drug is responsible for suffering, but if the method of execution itself is. Mississippi mother swaps death row for jail cell to await trial .

"(CNN) -- Judges on the paradise Indonesian island of Bali sentencing British grandmother Lindsay Sandiford to death on January 22 held that she had ""tarnished the image of Bali as a holiday destination."" No one expected a death sentence because the prosecutor, recognizing the sympathetic circumstances of the case, had only asked for a 15-year prison sentence. Sandiford heard the gasps in the courtroom when the sentence was handed down but didn't realize what had happened because her interpreter only translated part of what was said. He filled in the gaps with ""blah blah blah"" as he had done at all of her hearings over the past few months. Read more: Death penalty for British grandmother upheld in Bali . It was only when a reporter asked her how she felt about her sentence that Sandiford found out what had happened and faced the terrifying prospect of death by firing squad. In the middle of the night, as tourists sleep or party, Sandiford will be dressed in white and taken to a remote beach on an island where she will be tied to a pole placed in the sand. The firing squad of around 10 police from the elite paramilitary mobile brigade will have spent the days ahead of the execution practising using human-shaped targets. Sandiford will be hooded and a reflective marker will be placed over her chest to enable the shooters to see their target. The firing squad will take aim then shoot her through the heart from a meter away. Death by firing squad is not fast or painless. A priest, Father Burrows, who witnessed the executions of two Nigerians convicted of trafficking heroin in 2008, said they moaned and gurgled for up to 10 minutes after being shot. He sang ""Amazing Grace"" to try to comfort them as they died. I traveled to Indonesia a few years ago -- like many other tourists, I had long dreamed of seeing wild orangutans in the jungle near Medan. I had no idea that three people were executed by firing squad in that jungle in 2004. One was Ayodhya Prasad Chaubey, an Indian man shot in August. Amnesty International has expressed concern that his trial may not have upheld international standards for fairness. Due to a lack of legal representation or access to interpretation services before the trial, he was unable to prepare an adequate defense. Chaubey's lawyer raised concerns that the evidence against him (12 kilograms of heroin that he was convicted of trafficking) had not been presented in court. Like Sandiford, Chaubey was interrogated by the police without a lawyer or an interpreter. His lawyers were only informed of his execution after he had already been shot in the jungle and he never got the chance to say goodbye to his family. That October, a Thai man and woman were executed. Both came from a poor neighborhood of Bangkok. The executions of these impoverished people have tarnished my memories of that holiday forever -- I will never think of the jungle without remembering that shots rang out there and people moaned in pain as they died. Sandiford is extremely vulnerable. An independent expert on the drugs trade concluded that Sandiford's mental health problems would have made her an ""attractive target"" for the ""threats, manipulation and coercion"" of those who forced her into carrying the package by threatening her children. Surely the judges in Sandiford's case must know that sentencing people to die by tying them to poles and killing them slowly in jungles or on Bali's white sand beaches does more to damage the reputation of Bali as a holiday destination than the actions of a terrified, vulnerable grandmother trying to protect her children.

"(CNN) -- ""The vice-presidency isn't worth a pitcher of warm piss."" Those famous words were uttered by John Nance Garner to describe the office he held from 1933 to 1941. And John Adams, our nation's first vice president, described the position as: ""...the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived."" If the vice presidency is such a useless position, why are so many people now vying to be Mitt Romney's running mate? Because they know it might just be the best job in the country -- or at least in the federal government. Being vice president is like being one of the lesser Kardashian sisters (whatever their names are). Kim -- who is in essence the ""president"" of the clan -- is a household name, but she is also subject to a lot more scrutiny and pressure. Her sisters, however, are similar to our VP: they are paid great, treated like celebrities, and have almost no responsibilities. Look at some of the perks of being vice president: An annual salary of about $230,000, a beautiful house, a jet plane, limo service, a staff and even your own seal. All that is missing is a few product endorsement deals and the vice president truly would be a Kardashian. But wait, there are even more benefits, such as safety. Reprehensibly, a few our past presidents have been assassinated. But no one shoots at the veep. In fact, our vice presidents have shot other people. Dick Cheney shot his friend in the face just a few years ago. And in 1804, Vice President Aaron Burr had an infamous duel in which he shot and killed the former secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton. And we think that today's political climate is rough. Another bonus of being VP: very few constitutionally mandated obligations. The president has too many responsibilities to list. But the VP has only three: 1. president of the Senate -- which is ceremonial position; 2. Cast the tie breaking vote if the Senate is ever deadlocked; and 3. Accept the tally of the Electoral College for the presidential election ""in the Presence of the Senate and House of Representatives."" There are assistant managers at McDonald's who have more daily job responsibilities than our vice president. Indeed, there were 16 times in our nation's history that the office was vacant -- and in many cases for years at a time. It was not until 1967 that the 25th Amendment was adopted to establish a mechanism to replace a vice president if he left office midterm. Apparently, no one really cared too much before then if the vice presidency was vacant. Arguably the most painful responsibility for a sitting VP comes if he runs for president and loses. The VP is still required by the Constitution to read the name of the person who beat him in the presence of the entire Congress -- like Al Gore did in 2000. Awkward? Yes. Lots of work? No. And then there are the intangible benefits. For example, not too many people want your job. People grow up dreaming of being president. You don't hear kids say: ""One day I hope to grow up and be elected to the second-highest position in the federal government."" No. We are a nation of alphas, not betas. Plus, the media and political opponents don't pounce on every syllable the VP utters like they do with the president and presidential candidates. (I propose that any person running for president be read in essence a presidential ""Miranda warning"" explaining to him/her that anything they say, can and will be used against them -- even words taken out of context or are ones said by unnamed campaign advisors.) In contrast, the VP has the luxury to say stupid things. Our current one, Joe Biden, is famous for them. His ""best"" may have been when he offered his public condolences to the prime minister of Ireland for the passing of his mother. The only problem was that the prime minister's mother was still very much alive. But the modern day ""president"" of vice presidential gaffes had to be J. Danforth Quayle, a.k.a. Dan Quayle. This guy made George W. Bush sound like a philosopher king. Quayle made such ""insightful ""statements as: ""Republicans understand the importance of bondage between a mother and child."" And this gem: ""The future will be better tomorrow."" Soon, Mitt Romney -- ironically the person seeking possibly the worst job in our nation -- will tell us whom he has chosen to possibly serve in the best job in our nation. At this point, speculation abounds who that person will be. But whoever is nominated for VP should heed these sage words offered by Dan Quayle: ""One word sums up probably the responsibility of any vice president, and that one word is 'to be prepared.'"" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Dean Obeidallah: Many think VP is a useless position, but it may be the best job in the country .
He says it's like being a lesser Kardashian: perks, fame, salary and almost no responsibilities .

"(CNN) -- With the last day of the Tour de France usually uneventful as it relates to changes in the overall lead, Saturday marked the last realistic opportunity someone could catch Vincenzo Nibali. But given his big advantage, that was always unlikely. And after Saturday's penultimate stage, only a catastrophe can stop Nibali from becoming just the second Italian champion of cycling's most coveted race in more than 45 years -- Marco Pantani was the last Italian winner in 1998, preceding Lance Armstrong's now tainted reign. As Germany's Tony Martin claimed the 54-kilometer time trial from Bergerac to Perigueux, Nibali finished fourth. Crucially, though, he carries a nearly eight-minute lead into the final day, a 137.5-kilometer stretch from Evry to the Champs-Elysees in Paris. ""I haven't realized yet how big it is to win the Tour de France,"" Nibali of team Astana was quoted as saying by the Tour's official website. ""I'll keep that for tomorrow. ""It's difficult to ride the Tour but the beauty of it is to cycle on the Champs-ElysÃ©es. That's the biggest memory I've kept from my first participation -- the lap of honor, the enormous number of people, Paris' monuments. ""I'll try to savor my victory as much as I can. Every moment will count."" There hasn't been a home champion since Bernard Hinault in 1985 and that drought looks set to continue but the good news for the French is that two riders -- Jean-Christophe Peraud and Thibaut Pinot -- should finish on the podium for the first time since 1984. Peraud overtook Pinot for second. Peraud said the early exits of last year's winner Chris Froome and former winner Alberto Contador due to wrist and shin injuries, respectively, allowed him to contemplate a runner-up placing. ""The withdrawals of Froome and Contador opened a range of possibilities and I started dreaming about this second place,"" he said. ""I'm happy to have achieved that goal. ""I have a feeling of mission accomplished and a lot of joy today.""

"Washington (CNN) -- A U.S. trade spokeswoman said Tuesday officials are looking into a recent New York Times report that said China has halted shipments of rare earth minerals bound for the United States and Europe. China is the world's largest producer of rare earth minerals, which are crucial to making certain automotive and electronic products. ""We've seen the news report and are seeking more information in keeping with our recent announcement of an investigation into whether China's actions and policies are consistent with WTO rules,"" said U.S. Trade Representative spokeswoman Nefeterius Akeli. Citing three unnamed industry officials, the New York Times reported Chinese customs officials began imposing shipment restrictions Monday morning. It was not immediately clear whether all shipments were stopped, or whether some were being allowed through, the newspaper reported. The move, if true, would strain the already stressed trade relationship between the United States and China. U.S. trade officials recently said they would launch an investigation into whether China subsidizes and protects its clean energy producers in violation of World Trade Organization rules. ""We strongly support USTR's investigation into whether China is blocking exports of critical minerals to the U.S.,"" said Rep. Sander Levin, D-Michigan. He is also the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. ""If China is found to be blocking shipments of these critical minerals in retaliation to the U.S. investigation ... of Chinese practices regarding green technology, then China's blockade would require the U.S. to immediately challenge these actions as WTO inconsistent,"" he added.

"HOGANAS, Sweden (CNN) -- Swedish artist Lars Vilks says all he's doing is taking a stand in the name of artistic expression. But because of that stand, on this afternoon he's lying low -- on the ground, in fact -- looking for bombs under his car. Lars Vilks says if people don't like his artwork, then ""don't look at it."" Al Qaeda has put a $100,000 price on his head and offered an extra $50,000 for anyone who murders him by slitting his throat after the eccentric artist and sculptor drew a cartoon depicting the Prophet Mohammed as a dog. ""I don't think it should not be a problem to insult a religion, because it should be possible to insult all religions in a democratic way, "" says Vilks from his home in rural Sweden. ""If you insult one, then you should insult the other ones."" His crude, sketched caricature shows the head of Prophet Mohammed on the body of a dog. Dogs are considered unclean by conservative Muslims, and any depiction of the prophet is strictly forbidden. Vilks, who has been a controversial artist for more than three decades in Sweden, says his drawing was a calculated move, and he wanted it to elicit a reaction.  Watch ""I should slaughter you"" » . ""That's a way of expressing things. If you don't like it, don't look at it. And if you look at it, don't take it too seriously. No harm done, really,"" he says. When it's suggested that might prove an arrogant -- if not insulting -- way to engage Muslims, he is unrelenting, even defiant. ""No one actually loves the truth, but someone has to say it,"" he says. Vilks, a self-described atheist, points out he's an equal opportunity offender who in the past sketched a depiction of Jesus as a pedophile. Still one could argue Vilks should have known better because of what happened in Denmark in 2005, when a cartoonist's depictions of the prophet sparked violent protests in the Muslim world and prompted death threats against that cartoonist's life. Vilks' cartoon, which was published in August by the Swedish newspaper Nerikes Allehanda, hasn't reached that level of global protests, although it has stoked plenty of outrage. Muslims in Sweden demanded an apology from the newspaper, which has stood by Vilks on his freedom of expression stand. Pakistan and Iran also lodged formal protests with Sweden. One Swedish Muslim woman who lives just an hour-and-a-half drive from Vilks said she hopes to make good on the al Qaeda threat and slaughter Vilks like a lamb. ""I can do this in the name of Allah, and I will not fail. I could slaughter him in the name of Allah,"" says the woman who identified herself only as Amatullah. She adds, ""If I get the opportunity."" Dressed in a black burqa from head to toe and uttering death threat after death threat, the woman -- a wife and mother -- says she is defending her religion and her prophet if she manages to kill Vilks. Amatullah has already been fined for issuing death threats. Still, she claims she will never stop taunting him. Swedish police, who declined CNN's request for an interview, have advised Vilks to abandon his home. But the artist still works there by day and travels to a safe house by night. Vilks knows his defiance could get him killed, but he says his art is worth dying for. As he sits at his computer, his phone buzzes with a text message. Another death threat has just come in, this one from Pakistan. ""I will kill you, you son a bitch,"" he reads. There are hundreds of threats just like this one on his mobile phone, on his answering machine and in his e-mail inbox. ""You get used to it,"" he says. ""It's a bit of hide and seek. It's like living in a film."" E-mail to a friend .","Artist Lars Vilks stands by Mohammed cartoon even amid al Qaeda threats .

"(CNN) -- The United States takes on Ghana. Ronaldo takes on his left knee. And Iran tackles a giant killer. Here's what to look forward to during the Monday matches at the World Cup: . Third time is a charm? U.S. fans had a bad feeling while watching the World Cup draw in December, especially after being picked into a group that included Germany and Portugal. When it came time to learn the Americans' third opponent, World Cup nemesis Ghana was still on the board. Surely, the soccer gods wouldn't... They did. Perhaps the third time -- Ghana knocked the United States out of the Cup in 2006 and 2010 -- will be revenge. The two teams meet Monday in a Group G opener . Or maybe it's not payback time. ""There's no revenge factor,"" U.S. goalie Tim Howard, who was on both previous World Cup teams, said, according to USA Today. ""We don't feel that. That's not what's motivating us. We think that they're a good team but we also feel that we are slightly better as well."" Ronaldo feels swell . The body of the world's greatest player is 100% fine. Well, that's what I've heard. Wait, we are talking about Cristiano Ronaldo's fitness, are we not? He told reporters Sunday that when he takes the pitch in Monday's marquee matchup with Germany, the Portugal star said he'll be ready to go even if he's feeling a little knee pain -- and though he's bad at math. ""I'd love to be 110% and but I am 100% and that is enough to help my team,"" he told reporters Sunday, . Keeping the shirts on their backs . It is traditional for players to swap shirts at the end of a World Cup match. But Iran's football federation has told its players not to trade. Not for hygiene reasons, but because they don't want to buy a bunch of new ones. ""We are not giving the players a shirt for every game,"" Iranian Football Federation President Ali Kafaschian told the semiofficial Fars news agency, according to SBNation. ""The players have to be economical with the shirts."" That might be easier to do Monday against Nigeria than Saturday when they play Argentina and Lionel Messi wants to exchange shirts. Weather or not . Downpours, extreme heat and humidity and even snow. The United States faced all kinds of weather during World Cup qualifying. Monday, they may get to do it again. When they meet Ghana in Natal, there is a chance of showers. U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann doesn't want to hear questions about the weather. ""If it's raining or if it's snowing or if it's thunder and lightning, or whatever, this is about football being played in any circumstances,"" Klinsmann told reporters, according to mlssoccer.com. ESPNfc.com reported 50 homes in the area have been evacuated over flooding concerns brought on by nearly 9 inches of rain this weekend. Reason to love: Iran . The highest-ranked team in Asia wants to bring the plight of the Asiatic cheetah to the world's attention and has a new jersey with the endangered cat on it.

"(CNN) -- For goodness' sake, it's just like the Ford commercials. You know the ones, where they joke that ""and"" is better than ""or,"" whether it's sweet and sour chicken or a bed and breakfast inn. Same thing with working mothers. I am not a worker or a mother. I am both: a worker and a mother. This consistent, aggressive infighting about leaning in vs. leaning out -- reignited by the New York Times story this week, ""Coveting Not a Corner Office, But Time At Home"" -- is just more fodder for woman-on-woman mudslinging. And it doesn't help anyone, least of all our kids, who are as a result groomed to think you can't be all you want to be. Social media and listservs of professional women have been back and forth commenting on this seemingly neverending fight, fueled in part by media coverage and by the persistent attacks and retreats of women sniping at other women -- on both sides. It is belittling to assert that women can handle only one role at a time. And that one role is better than the other. No one is insisting a father has to choose between his work and his children in order to be a good dad. So why can a woman perform just one role at a time? This latest New York Times feature misses a key possibility: that it is entirely possible to be an ambitious good mother. The births of my three sons (now 24, 22 and 19) did not hormonally erase my desire to accomplish as much as possible professionally. The work that I love -- teaching journalism at Northwestern University, writing books and articles, giving keynotes and leading professional workshops -- has not hindered my ability to attend every parent-teacher conference or scream their names from the stands for the past 20 years. But from this latest piece of work, you can gather it is not possible as a working parent to walk and chew gum at the same time. I recoil at the way working parents are characterized in this passage: ""I never miss a baseball game,"" said Ms. Uttech, uttering a statement that is a fantasy for millions of working mothers (and fathers) nationwide. (This attendance record is even more impressive when you realize that her children play in upward of six a week.) Yes, Sara Uttech, you did your fair share. But I want to point out to the writer that like so many women, I went to way more than six games, matches, tournaments or conferences a week for three sons who played baseball, basketball, soccer and football before each finally settled into wrestling. There were weeks with nine to 15 games and practices for three boys. On the extremely rare occasion I missed? It was because one son was in a game or match at the same time as another. There were plenty of Saturdays where I drove from one gym to another across the suburbs of Chicago, logging more than 100 miles. And on Monday, I went to work. A whole lot of us do. According to a recent study from Pew Research, 40% of all households with children younger than 18 include women who are either the sole or primary breadwinners. Most of us -- 63% -- are single mothers. What working women and stay-at-home mothers do not do is stop thinking of this as black/white either/or territory. Millions of us waste time believing the grass is greener on the other side. Even fashion designer Victoria Beckham, 39, feels that she may be missing out, and she comes home to David Beckham. She told US Weekly this week, ""It's a huge juggling act, when you are a working mother and looking after your family. Millions and millions of women around the world are doing this every day, but it's not easy and yes, you feel guilty every time you walk out of the door to go to work."" As a single parent who is sole support and has been for many years, I have needed to work as hard as I possibly can, saying yes to every invitation to consult, speak, write or work in order to pay the mortgage, food, tuition, room and board and all else for three sons. I decided that it would be optimal to do work I love because there is no choice to opt out. For me, it works. I am not superwoman, and I am not hissing at the neighbors who stay home with their children as I pull out of the garage at 7 a.m. I am not perfect; I do not do everything perfectly. I just really enjoy my life as a mother who is professionally ambitious, too. And I do not believe my children have suffered because of it. Liz O'Donnell, who recently completed the upcoming book ""Mogul, Mom & Maid: The Balancing Act of The Modern Woman,"" says her research shows that women do not want an either/or life. ""I've talked to scores of women who are trying to balance career and family. These women want fulfilling careers, and they are willing to do the hard work. But they are not willing to sacrifice their families, nor should they have to,"" O'Donnell said. But the issue is not entirely decided by mothers but by their employers. In her New York Times story, Catherine Rampell writes in defense of the story's main character's decision to scale back at work: ""Ms. Uttech wants a rewarding career, but more than that she wants a flexible one. That ranking of priorities is not necessarily the one underlying best-selling books like Sheryl Sandberg's 'Lean In,' which advises women to seek out leadership positions, throw themselves at their careers, find a partner who helps with child care and supports their ambition, and negotiate for raises and promotions."" O'Donnell, a public relations executive, founder of the blog Hello, Ladies and mother of two, disagrees. ""Framing the issue as leaning in vs. leaning out isn't accurate,"" she said. ""For a variety of reasons, from overt and subtle gender discrimination at work, inflexible workplace policies, lack of support at home, outdated school schedules that don't mesh with corporate hours, women are rejecting the corner office and businesses should take heed."" As women, we do not hesitate to claim that we can be wives, mothers, sisters, daughters and friends at the same time. Why can we not be successful in our professions and parents at the same time without someone insisting it can't be done? Why can't we be good mothers and good employees? I say it is about ""and,"" not ""or."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michele Weldon.","Michele Weldon writes that women sniping about whether to ""Lean In"" doesn't help .

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo believes his ""arrogant"" image has prevented him from capturing the hearts of football fans across the globe. In an exclusive interview with CNN, the Real Madrid forward reveals how his onfield demeanor has left him sitting in the shadow of the sport's golden boy and fans' favorite, Lionel Messi. ""I don't want to cry about it, but sometimes I think yes,"" said Ronaldo after being asked whether his image had cost him in the past. ""It's a question to which I never give the 100% right answer, because sometimes I really don't know. ""I don't think it's allowed for people to change my personality. ""Maybe sometimes, I agree that I have a bad image on the pitch because I'm too serious."" Ronaldo and Messi will go head-to-head for the prestigious Ballon d'Or in January, with the Barcelona star having won the award on each of the previous three occasions. Barca's unbeaten run ended by Celtic . Both men have taken the sport to a new level with their record goalscoring feats -- Ronaldo has scored an astonishing 164 times in 160 appearances for the Spanish champions, while Messi hit 50 in La Liga alone last term. Ronaldo, who won the Ballon d'Or in 2008 when at Manchester United, led Madrid to the league title last season and has scored in his past six successive El Clasicos. The 27-year-old Portugal star is unhappy with how he's often portrayed in the media compared to more ""loveable"" Messi and says he has become a ""victim."" ""But if you really know me, if you are my friend and I leave you inside my house and you share the day with me, you will know I hate to lose,"" he said. ""I learn by my mistakes and that's life.

While Messi often plays with a smile on his face like a kid in the schoolyard, Ronaldo is often seen moaning, gesticulating and scowling while trying to inspire Real to victory.

"(CNN) -- A shuttle bus crashed Friday morning at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, injuring 15 people, police said, and temporarily snarling vehicle traffic at one of the world's busiest centers for air travel. The bus, shuttling people between the terminals and a rental car company, was leaving Interstate 190 on a lane toward a terminal when it struck a concrete median about 6:30 a.m. CT, CNN affiliate WBBM reported. Fifteen people were injured and were being taken to hospitals, but the severity of their injuries wasn't immediately clear, Chicago police spokeswoman Ana Pacheco said. The injured included the driver, who for a time was pinned by a guardrail that penetrated the bus upon impact, CNN affiliate WLS reported. Two Chicago firefighters who witnessed the crash freed the driver and then helped other passengers, WLS reported. Details about what caused the wreck were not immediately available. The wreck prompted the closure of some I-190 lanes and caused traffic backups on the interstate on Friday morning, WLS reported.","WBBM says rental car company's shuttle bus struck concrete median .

"(CNN) -- It's the Earth-orbiting research lab as big as a five-bedroom house, complete with two bathrooms, a gym and a huge bay window -- but how much do we know about what goes on at the International Space Station? We watched as astronauts played football in space during the World Cup, we listened to Chris Hadfield croon his rendition of David Bowie's ""Space Oddity,"" and we've all seen the odd space selfie snapped in zero gravity. Sure, the lucky few who have gone up to the International Space Station (ISS) seem to be having fun. But there's also a serious side to the astronauts' sojourns among the stars that we don't often hear about. ""We are bettering the human experience on Earth. Going further, going beyond,"" says Stephanie Buskirk Dudley, an ISS payload operations director (POD) who helps coordinate all the research conducted at the facility. ""We learn things by doing science that we never even knew we would learn. And it's actually because we are there."" If the ISS is a crazy space circus, then Buskirk Dudley is one of the ringmasters leading the ever-changing scientific troupe. She explains: ""We've got cameras looking at all over the Earth from the space station that are helping with disaster research and coastal erosion. We have one coming for ocean temperature and warming of the oceans. We are doing research that affects every single person on the planet."" Science among the stars . It became humanity's home away from home in October 2000 when the first six astronauts arrived on board and the ISS has been busy ever since. The permanently orbiting facility -- which has cost an estimated â‚¬100 billion (just under $135 billion) according to the European Space Agency -- has since been inhabited constantly by astronauts as they work tirelessly to answer some of science's most intriguing questions. Often we see some of the more entertaining demonstrations appear on social media. Just last month U.S. astronaut Reid Wiseman uploaded the world's first #SpaceVine of a spectacular fireball experiment called FLEX-2, which examines how fuel ignites in space. Here on Earth, we thought it looked pretty cool. For scientists, the results could yield new insights into fuel efficiency for engines on Earth and safer future spacecraft production. Another seemingly quirky experiment involves sending 40 mice up to the station later this year, which will be their home for six months -- roughly a quarter of a mouse's average lifespan. The rodents' journey to space may look like an odd move for scientists but it is hoped the ""moustronauts"" will provide valuable biomedical insight into how spaceflight affects the human body. These are just some of the hundreds of investigations taking place every day aboard the floating outpost by scientists from all around the world. The mammoth task is coordinated by the Payload Operations Integration Center (POIC) at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Buskirk Dudley is one of 23 certified PODs who plan every minute detail involving space station research. Pioneering research is conducted 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and the key to success is planning, she says. ""[It takes] a great team of people doing many different jobs. Everybody is an expert in their own little field. It really takes a whole team with a lot of hard work and planning. ""We've got, for instance, ultrasound on board the station and we have perfected training non-medical personnel -- astronauts -- to perform on themselves and get good results for doctors on Earth. And that is directly applicable to countries in which medicine is not as available as it is in the U.S. and the UK."" The success of ultrasound experiments by non-medical personnel in space has led scientists to believe that back on Earth, patients could be trained to perform their own ultrasound exams and send the images to doctors in situations where a medical facility is difficult to access. Buskirk Dudley adds: ""Over half of the population of the world, for instance, is a woman. We are doing research on bone health every single day and just that one experiment alone could help over 50% of the world's population. That is just human research: we've got biological research, we've got material research, combustion, particle physics -- the whole gamut of research we're doing every single day. ""Today, the crew is upgrading the 'Robonaut' (a humanoid robot on the ISS). Our eventual goal is to give him legs and have him do maintenance tasks to free up the crew for more science. When we originally flew him, he was just a torso and arms. And they are doing robot surgery to upgrade all his internal electronics so they can eventually add legs to him."" 'It's research for the world' But Buskirk Dudley is keen to point out that it's a truly International Space Station, not simply an American enterprise. POIC is one of five international control centers working to synchronize the research at the ISS. Other similar control centers are located in Germany, Japan, Russia and, of course, back at Mission Control at Johnson Space Center in Houston. ""Even though it's NASA science that we're doing, the scientists are all over the world. It's not just science in the U.S.,"" says Buskirk Dudley. ""The scientists that we work with are not at those control centers. They are in their lab, in their university, in their house perhaps -- all over the world. We've enabled them to do the science wherever they might be."" Cheryl Nickerson is a professor at the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University. She is one such trailblazing scientist at the forefront of cellular biomechanics, who has achieved remarkable success using the ISS to conduct unique spaceflight research into diseases such as salmonella. ""The microgravity environment of spaceflight offers a unique environment for ground-breaking biotechnology and biomedical innovations and discoveries to advance human health in infectious disease, cancer, aging, bone and muscle-wasting diseases, and advances in tissue engineering,"" she says. ""Our research demonstrated that spaceflight increased the virulence of salmonella and globally altered the gene expression of this pathogen in unique ways that are not observed using traditional experimental approaches on Earth."" And she's not done there. Later this year, commercial carrier SpaceX will fly the professor's latest NASA-funded experiment, Micro-5, to the space station, where her team will monitor the salmonella infection process in real-time when the human surrogate host and pathogen are simultaneously exposed to spaceflight. For Nickerson, the ISS is invaluable for the ongoing pursuit of knowledge. ""If properly implemented, the legacy of an ISS research portfolio consisting of hypothesis-driven, impeccably designed and executed experiments will have a lasting impact on our nation's scientific capability, economy, and quality of our lives.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The White House defended President Barack Obama from criticism that he was tone deaf in his reaction to the mass shootings at Washington Navy Yard. Obama: Shooting a 'cowardly' act . For a second straight day, White House press secretary Jay Carney faced questions about a Monday afternoon event that occurred as the situation at the Navy Yard was still unfolding. Obama touched on the tragedy before forcefully criticizing conservative Republicans who are threatening to shut down the government. Obama pressures conservative Republicans . McCain to House Republicans: Don't shut down government . ""I understand that some Republicans are trying to make something of this,"" Carney said on Tuesday in response to a question from CNN Senior White House Correspondent Jim Acosta. ""The president spoke about the Navy Yard at the very top of his briefing. He talked about the cowardly act that had taken place, the tragedy that was unfolding and the loss of life and he called for and demanded a seamless investigation with federal and local law enforcement officials and that is what we're seeing now,"" Carney said. Obama himself stepped in on Tuesday to address the controversy, telling Telemundo in an interview to ""keep in mind"" that he addressed the shooting while it was still going on, ""while we were still gathering information."" He continued, ""I think that everybody understands that the minute something like this happens, I'm in touch with the FBI, I'm in touch with my national security team, we're making sure that all the assets are out there for us to deal with this as well as we can."" On the other hand, Obama said, ""what is also important to remember is that Congress has a lot of work to do right now"" in a short period of time, noting looming fiscal deadlines that he says are crucial for the economy. Obama had planned on Tuesday to tout his economic accomplishments on the fifth anniversary of the Wall Street meltdown and criticize a group of conservative Republicans for their push to shut down the federal government if the national health care law isn't defunded. His comments were designed as a prelude to the White House battle plan in the fights over the upcoming deadlines over government funding, the debt ceiling, and as a Americans begin to start enrolling in the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. 5 things Obama planned before shooting . A distracted president struggles with the economy . White House officials did delay the event from late morning to early afternoon, to ensure that the president wouldn't be speaking at the same time at a news conference updating the evolving situation at the Navy Yard. But they said they never considered canceling the event. ""We are confronting another mass shooting and it happened on a military installation in our nation's capital. It's a shooting that targeted our military and civilian personnel,"" the president said at the top of his remarks. ""These are men and women who were going to work, doing their jobs protecting all of us. They're patriots and they know the dangers of serving abroad but today they face the unimaginable violence that they wouldn't have expected here at home."" But minutes later Obama took the fight to some in the GOP, saying, ""I cannot remember a time when one faction of one party promises economic chaos if it can't get 100% of what it wants. That's never happened before but that's what's happening right now,"" and adding that forcing a shutdown would be the ""height of irresponsibility."" Your guide to a government shutdown . Debt ceiling 'X date' could hit Oct. 18 . The president's quick pivot first to the latest developments in the Syrian crisis and then into his criticism of the GOP stands in contrast to his initial reaction to last December's shooting of 20 children and six adults in Newtown, Connecticut, when he urged national unity. And it brought criticism from House Speaker John Boehner. ""It's a shame that the president could not manage to rise above partisanship today,"" the top Republican in Congress said in a statement a few hours after Obama's event. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus continued the attack on Tuesday, tweeting ""Disappointing that POTUS couldn't rise above partisanship yesterday...hours after #NavyYardShooting"" Former House Speaker and 2012 Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich expanded on the criticism. ""President Reagan, in the tragedy of the (space shuttle) Challenger, postponed the State of the Union address because he realized the country needed to be in mourning. President Obama should have recognized that an event this painful and tragic, in the nation's capital, required being president rather than partisan, and being concerned about people rather than concerned about attacking,"" said Gingrich, a co-host of CNN's ""Crossfire."" A top Republican strategist went a step farther. ""When there is a tragic event like this in the nation's capital and the local baseball team expresses that it would be insensitive to participate in the national pastime, but the president proceeds with a self-congratulatory press conference to celebrate his miniscule economic accomplishments, it tells you the Obama administration has become tone-deaf,"" said Alex Castellanos, a CNN contributor who co-founded Purple Strategies, a bipartisan public affairs firm. ""Bill Clinton, who 'felt our pain,' would never have made this mistake."" Opinion: Gun control is not the answer . It's not just Republicans who are critical of the president -- a senior Democratic consultant was critical of Obama's timing, too. ""Suprisingly tone-deaf. National unity has been at the heart of the Obama brand since his 2004 'there are no red states and no blue states' speech. To pass up a chance to unite the country after a tragedy was a missed opportunity. Unhelpful in terms of politics. Even more unhelpful in terms of governance,"" said the consultant, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely. While Carney says the president ""was horrified by this news"" (of the shootings), he defended Monday's White House event and wouldn't entertain any second day quarterbacking, saying ""we knew what the public knew,"" adding ""we had the same information you did."" Will rampage move the dial on gun control? And he pushed back against criticism that Obama's speech was partisan. ""Far from being a partisan speech, the president made clear in his speech that many Republicans on Capitol Hill agree with him that we should not go down the road of threatening to shut down the government or defaulting on our obligations in the name of some partisan agenda item,"" Carney said. And White House officials questioned the appropriateness of some House Republicans who they say were launching partisan attacks at the administration on Monday over last September's deadly attack at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi that left the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans dead. Later Monday, the tone did appear to shift at the White House. A Latin music event in the East Room that was planned for the evening was postponed, according to White House officials, ""in light of today's tragic events at the Washington Navy Yard and out of respect for the victims and their families."" Around the same time, the U.S. flag on top of the White House was lowered to half staff.

"(CNN) -- Melbourne airport was hit with a power outage on Wednesday, temporarily grounding outgoing flights and bringing other airport services to a halt. At 9:31 a.m. local time, the Australian airport posted on its official Twitter account that a ""major power outage has affected airport operations."" While the blackout lasted only an hour, according to the Age, it caused chaos in airport procedures and consternation among passengers. Aside from flight delays, customs processing was halted, security gates were closed, and shops could not conduct sales. Eventually, both security and customs began processing passengers manually, with security staff examining luggage manually. ''It's pretty frustrating. People are just sitting around and looking pissed off. Everyone has basically given up on their day,'' a woman named Ms. Hamilton told the Age. Passengers on incoming flights were also kept waiting, including ABC News correspondent, Jen King . ""Everyone was sitting around in the dark,"" she said. ""Then we made our way out. But of course once we went past the security it looked a nightmare."" ""It was just packed with people. ""[We went] downstairs to the luggage area which was a bit of a fiasco as well because none of the carousels were working. Flights eventually came back into operation, according a tweet posted at 11:08am local time by Melbourne Airport.

"(CNN) -- Many of the Oklahoma families whose lives were devastated by the tornado will recover over time, especially with the help and support of family and community. But children need special attention as they struggle with what happened on Monday and upheavals in their family and school routines. Children's reactions will vary depending on their age and their experience with the tornado. They may get upset during a storm because they fear another tornado or worry when their parents leave their side. They might display changes in their behavior, such as irritability and anger or decreased concentration. They may withdraw or have physical complaints, and sleep or appetite troubles. It's reassuring to know these reactions are common and generally diminish over time. Their reactions are strongly influenced by how their parents, teachers and other caregivers are coping. Those teachers who took care of their students during the storm will need to seek their own supports and take care of themselves while showing kids how to cope in a positive way. Parents can help children recover by calmly talking with them about any concerns. This will be important over the weeks and months to come. Mother's instinct saves lives of 3 sons . Parents must assure children that they are safe and help them cope with distress associated with reminders of the tornado -- like sirens or the destruction they see. They should stick to normal mealtime and bedtime routines as much as possible. Adults should also be careful what they and others say in front of the kids and be especially patient with changes in children's behavior. Rest, exercise and a balanced diet are important. It helps to limit media reports and social media about the tornado. People should stay connected to friends and family and find time for activities that give them a break from additional stress. If the children have lost a loved one, it's important to talk about it. Parents can reminisce about that person with their kids and conduct a memorial activity that children can join in. Grieving is even more difficult when a loved one dies suddenly in traumatic circumstances. Families need their own traditions and rituals when someone dies so they can support one another and manage a wide range of emotional responses. Answering questions about death for children can be challenging -- it's important to be truthful, give answers that are appropriate for their ages and listen carefully to their feelings. Families remember tornado victims . The tornado hit during the day when children and parents were separated. Because of that, young children may become especially clingy and worry when they are away from their parents. In the next weeks, parents should stay with their children as much as possible. If they need to leave, they should make sure a familiar adult is with the children and that they know when their parents will return. If any of these reactions continue over a month or worsen over time, parents should consider a mental health consultation.As the community begins to recover, be sure to acknowledge the high school seniors who are graduating in the next week, as this is an important milestone to be commemorated. With the ending of school, some teenagers may have lost their summer jobs and it will be important to help them find alternatives like assisting recovery efforts, cleaning debris, babysitting, or organizing collection drives. Doctor's quick thinking saves patients . It's two years this week that tornadoes hit Joplin, Missouri, which is still recovering. With other recent disasters like Sandy Hook, parents are increasingly worried about their children's safety. Families should take this opportunity to make sure that school and family emergency plans are in place. That, and open communication will go a long way toward supporting children with their responses to this devastating tornado.

"(CNN) -- Nine of the 10 countries with the world's highest rates of child marriage are in Africa: Niger, Chad and Central African Republic, Guinea, Mozambique, Mali, Burkina Faso and South Sudan, and Malawi. My country, Tanzania, did not make the list. But in traditional Maasai communities like mine, marrying off girls is very common. I was married at 13 to a man in his 70s. It happened during Christmas break. My father told my school that I had died. Even if he hadn't, I would have been forced to leave when I got pregnant because that was the law at the time. I gave birth to my first child within a year. I had no professional prenatal care and no trained medical assistance during delivery. I had to depend on my husband and his other wives for guidance. It was a very painful experience. Every time I became pregnant after that I felt sick and scared. Because of all these difficult births I have a hard time controlling my bladder and it can be painful to urinate. Today, I am a mother of five at 29 years old. International Women's Day: Whose words inspire you? In communities like mine, age is not understood as a number. Our traditional values dictate girls are meant for marriage, and when the men decide we are biologically ready, we are married. Marriage is sometimes a way of forming and cementing relationships. But it is also a way of earning money. My family received a bride price from my husband and then he took me away to become one of his wives. He beat me regularly, and so I fled back to my village. But my father and brother told me the price had been paid, this was no longer my home, I had to return. It wasn't until six years ago that I was able to take charge of my own destiny. I ran away to the city of Arusha and met Rebecca, a volunteer with the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA). Through counseling, workshops and friendship, I gained more confidence in my own voice and learned to support myself. When I returned to my village, I found an ally: one of our community leaders, named Abraham. In his own extended family girls were running away from forced marriages. He felt obliged to support them by giving them shelter and food. Quietly, he was encouraging them to go to school hoping it would be a way to get girls out of their situation. When he learned about how I was able to find support from YWCA he was inspired. Knowing there would be places for girls to go outside their communities helped convince him they would be OK if they left their marriages. But I love my family and my community, and I didn't want leaving to be the answer. So I set up a YWCA in my village and slowly, change is happening. Some men and boys are not happy with what I'm doing. I have to be around others all the time to protect myself from harassment. I don't know if my own father would approve if he were still alive. But many are recognizing that this is the way forward -- that girls have value beyond marriage. That we can earn money and contribute more to our communities when we stay in school. Read also: School 'pays dowry' to save girls from marriage . My brother used to think I was wrong to leave my husband. But seeing how well I am doing selling traditional Maasai jewelry and clothing he is starting to respect my choice. He no longer beats me, but he still won't let me have access to any of my father's farms. Thankfully, I have supporters in my community who help give me other options to grow food for my children. I believe my relationship with my brother will get better with time. I am still working on it. My mother is so proud. She used to fear my disobedience to my husband would reflect poorly on her and she would be cast out of the community. But now she sees I am welcome and respected and she is so happy to have me back in her life. When attitudes begin to shift from within communities this way, then people start to have hope. And politicians gain more courage to act. Without support from community leaders, parliamentarians fear passing laws will cost them votes and they will lose power to make any difference at all. Likewise, passing laws provides no guarantee girls will be protected unless they have community support: 158 countries have set the legal age for marriage at 18 years but the laws are simply ignored by communities where marrying children and adolescent girls is common practice. In the fight against child marriage, the biggest battle is finding those who are ready for change and giving them the courage to speak to others. Those of us who believe in the power of girls, who have seen what they can do when they have options, we need to tell everyone we can. We need to teach girls that it's OK to say no to marrying before they are ready, and that there are places they can go if they have to run away. We need to talk to families about different ways their girls can contribute to their livelihoods, so that marriage is not seen as the only option. We need to show community leaders examples of girls who have stayed in school, learned skills, and have helped develop their local economies. We need to convince politicians that they should pass laws to protect and empower girls, and that the people will support them if they do. And we need to share our success stories with the world. Because people need to know we are fighting for change and they can join us in their own countries and communities. Change is possible when we believe in each other. I am living proof. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mereso Kilusu.","Mereso Kilusu was a child bride. Now she campaigns against child marriage .

"(CNN) -- How do you run a business effectively when your supremo is facing bribery charges over a multibillion-dollar deal? In the case of Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone you step down as director of the sport's holding company -- Delta Topco -- but continue to run one of the world's most lucrative sport franchises on a day-to-day basis. The 83-year-old Ecclestone is accused of making a corrupt payment during his sale of the sport in 2006 and was indicted on bribery charges in German. He is set to go on trial in April. He denies the charges and he was not immediately available for comment when his office was contacted by CNN. Following the court's decision, Delta Topco Limited held a board meeting to plan how best to run the F1 business. ""Mr. Ecclestone has reassured the board that he is innocent of the charges and intends to vigorously defend the case which will commence in late April 2014,"" said a Delta Topco statement. ""After discussion with the board, Mr. Ecclestone has proposed and the board has agreed that until the case has been concluded, he will step down as a director with immediate effect, thereby relinquishing his board duties and responsibilities until the case has been resolved. ""The board believes that it is in the best interests of both the F1 business and the sport that Mr. Ecclestone should continue to run the business on a day-to-day basis, but subject to increased monitoring and control by the board. ""Mr. Ecclestone has agreed to these arrangements. The approval and signing of significant contracts and other material business arrangements shall now be the responsibility of the chairman, Mr. Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, and deputy chairman, Mr. Donald Mackenzie."" Ecclestone is accused of making a corrupt payment to Gerhard Gribkowsky, a banker who worked on the sale of F1 to private equity firm CVC in 2006. Gribkowsky was jailed for eight and a half years in 2012 after he admitted to taking bribes, an accusation which Ecclestone denies.","Bernie Ecclestone will stand trial on bribery charges, a German court announced .

"(CNN) -- The number of uprooted people across the world dropped slightly last year, but new displacement this year in conflict zones like Pakistan, Somalia and Sri Lanka so far ""has already more than offset the decline,"" the U.N. refugee agency said Tuesday. Pakistani displaced battle severe winds and dust at Jalozai refugee camp near Peshawar. ""Today, we are seeing a relentless series of internal conflicts that are generating millions of uprooted people,"" U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said in a news release. This is one of the main points in Global Trends, an annual report by the U.N. agency on developments regarding refugees, internally displaced people, asylum seekers and stateless people. The number of ""uprooted people worldwide"" in 2008 was 42 million, a drop of about 700,000 from 2007, according to the report. ""In 2009, we have already seen substantial new displacements, namely in Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Somalia,"" Guterres said. ""While some displacements may be short-lived, others can take years and even decades to resolve. We continue to face several longer-term internal displacement situations in places like Colombia, Iraq, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia. Each of these conflicts has also generated refugees who flee beyond their borders."" The number of refugees and internally displaced people who returned home in 2008 was around 2 million, a decline from 2007, the report said. Refugee repatriation, which was 604,000, was down 17 percent. Displaced people's returns were down by 34 percent at 1.4 million people. ""Traditionally the largest durable solution for refugees, it was the second-lowest repatriation total in 15 years,"" the report said. ""The decline in part reflects deteriorating security conditions, namely in Afghanistan and Sudan."" The report listed other statistics and trends in 2008: .","U.N. reports shows slight decline in global refugee numbers to 42 million in 2008 .

"(CNN) -- The United Nations envoy to Ukraine who was threatened by armed men in Crimea on Wednesday told CNN he hopes his experience ""serves as a reminder to all how dangerous the situation has become."" Robert Serry said the car he was traveling in was blocked by armed men in camouflage uniforms, who did not identify themselves, after he visited the headquarters of the Ukrainian navy in Simferopol. The men told Serry they had orders to take him to the airport immediately, but Serry refused. A brief standoff ensued. The men pulled Serry's driver out of the car, and some managed to get in, the envoy said. He got out. Serry walked and sought refuge for hours in a cafe, swarmed by protesters. He was eventually taken safely to the airport and left the country. While he told CNN's ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer"" he was not in fear for his life, the incident shows the ""very urgent need to de-escalate"" the tensions. ""All those who are responsible and can do that must have cool heads, lower their rhetoric, and address the situation. I'm very, very afraid for what could happen if there is bloodshed,"" Serry said from Istanbul, Turkey. Leaked call raises questions about who was behind sniper attacks in Ukraine . He was in Crimea at the behest of the U.N. secretary-general to report on what's happening there. When asked by Blitzer what he believes need to be done, the envoy replied the situation on the ground needs to be addressed first. ""A mechanism is very much needed between the parties involved on the Crimea to actually start to control the situation and to de-escalate these tensions. There can be help from the outside if the parties accept that,"" he said. ""What is, of course, also very important is that a political dialogue starts between representatives from the Republic of Crimea and the government in Kiev."" Serry said Ukraine could be pulled apart if the rhetoric between the East ad West continues to rise. The incident was mentioned Wednesday by the U.S. Secretary of State, who met with his Russian counterpart in Paris. ""We have seen today with what happened with Special Envoy Serry, just how important it is to ensure the safety of those monitors and observers,"" John Kerry said.

"(CNN) -- When the Burj Khalifa officially opened in Dubai on Monday, much of the world press noted the irony of the world's tallest building unveiled just weeks after the emirate's debt crash. But a look at the history of record-breaking skyscrapers and business cycles suggests otherwise -- the opening of every single ""world's tallest"" building in the past century has coincided with an economic downturn. One person who wasn't surprised by the economic woes greeting the dedication of the Burj Khalifa (renamed Monday from Burj Dubai in honor of the sheikh of Abu Dhabi, which recently threw Dubai a $10 billion lifeline) was Auburn University economist Mark Thornton. He predicted tough times for the emirate two years ago in a blog entitled ""New Record Skyscraper (and depression?) in the making."" He noted that economic depression or stock market collapse usually occurs prior to completion of such skyscrapers. ""Maybe the economic damage will be confined to the UAE,"" he wrote in his post on August 7, 2007 -- the summer in the United States when subprime mortgage defaults started to rise, auguring the start of the Great Recession. The opening of these epic edifices is a strikingly reliable indicator of a business downturn: . * The 186-meter Singer building opened in New York in the wake of the market panic of 1907. * The Empire State Building opened in 1931, taking the mantle of world's tallest building briefly held by 40 Wall Street and Chrysler Buildings. All of these New York buildings were conceived before the 1929 Crash, and opened after the Great Depression had begun. * The two towers of the World Trade Center were opened in 1972 and 1973, and the Sears Tower (since renamed Willis Tower) opened in 1974 -- when the U.S. was mired in ""stagflation"" of growing unemployment and inflation. * Petronas Towers opened in 1998 in Malaysia, just as the Asia Financial Crisis was sweeping through the region. This correlation was first noticed by market analyst Christofer Rathke, who while based in Tokyo in the 1980s noticed the spate of building huge building projects in Japan just as its economic bubble burst. ""It seemed strikingly similar to what happened during the building of the Chrysler Building in New York,"" he said. Digging deeper, he found that long-running bull markets always preceded the building of these tall structures. In 1999, Hong Kong-based analyst Andrew Lawrence wrote a widely read research paper called ""The Skyscraper Index"" which furthered the argument that super-tall buildings augur bad times. The index has been treated as a novelty indicator -- much like the Super Bowl index (if a team from the NFC division wins, U.S. stock markets on average finish the year ahead), Thornton said. But Thornton argues in his 2005 research paper, ""Skyscrapers and Business Cycles,"" that the correlation is real: Skyscrapers are a physical manifestation of the bull markets that build them. ""It has all the components that are involved in a major boom or bust cycle,"" Thornton said. The components that give rise to the skyscrapers give rise to the boom: loose monetary policy and easy credit drive up land prices, ""and people want to build higher to offset that,"" he said. ""You have easy credit and low interest rates fueling stock prices, and this creates an overly speculative market place. ""Monetary inflation and credit tends to increase the size of companies, who grow from local, regional to an international presence"" -- creating both the wealth to build and the customer demand, Thornton said. And, of course, rising wealth inflates egos. ""There is an issue of vanity -- people want to build something a little higher, and (customers) want to locate in those prestigious places,"" Thornton said. ""It definitely improves the value of your business card."" The skyscraper correlation is ""has a very polarizing effect on people"" in the tall building industry, said Steve Watts, a partner with Davis Langdon & Seah international and co-chair of economics committee of the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, the international body which officially ranks the world's highest structures. ""It annoys a lot of people, but I personally think that the economics the theory is based on is sound,"" he said. However, Watts points out that the economic life of iconic structures outlasts the boom times that created them and the bust that follows. ""Compared to a 10-story office block, which probably has a life cycle of 20 years, some of these towers have lifecycles of 70 years or more,"" he said. The past decade since the completion of the Petronas Towers ""has been a period of time for unprecedented success of tall buildings,"" he said, but with the ribbon-cutting of the Burj Khalifa and the economic downturn, he believes the go-go times in the high-rise race are over -- for now. ""My personal view is it will be a while before you'll see any other building built that beats the Burj,"" he said. If the skyscraper effect is true, that could be good news for the world economy.","The opening of every single ""world's tallest"" building in the past century has coincided with an economic downturn .

"(CNN) -- The latest incarnation of Boeing's Dreamliner finished its maiden flight Tuesday afternoon, completing a test run of more than five hours. A larger version of the 787-8, the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner is 206 feet long -- 20 feet longer than its predecessor -- and holds 40 more passengers. (The 787-8 can hold 210-250 passengers.) Its range is also greater, at 8,000-8,500 nautical miles, versus the 787-8's range of 7,650-8,200 nautical miles. Like the 787-8, the new plane uses 20% less fuel and has 20% fewer emissions than other planes its size. Watch it online . Boeing provided live coverage via webcast prior to the aircraft's 11:02 a.m. PT (1 p.m. ET) takeoff from Paine Field Airport in Everett, Washington. After a five-hour, 16-minute flight, it landed at Seattle's Boeing Field at 4:18 p.m. PT (7:18 p.m. ET). The two pilots, Capt. Mike Bryan and Capt. Randy Neville, were expected to speak afterward at a news conference, also to be carried on the webcast. ""This is a beautiful machine,"" said Ray Conner, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, speaking on the webcast shortly after takeoff. ""It's going to be the backbone of the 787 fleet."" Pre-debut . The latest Dreamliner rolled out of the factory in Everett, Washington, in late August, and it is scheduled to be delivered to its first customer, Air New Zealand, in mid-2014. World's largest airliner: Is bigger better? This year, Boeing has had more than 82 orders to date for the 787, with the largest order of 42 planes coming from American Airlines. Singapore Airlines has the second largest order for 787s with 30 planes ordered. Approximately 40% of all 787 orders to date (not just this year) are for the 787-9. The announcement is one of the few celebratory moments for the company in recent months. The four-month global grounding of the entire Dreamliner fleet, after an ANA flight was diverted following a battery fire in January, was the first such global grounding in 30 years. To get the plane back in the sky, a team made up of experts from Boeing and from outside the company redesigned the system so battery cells would be separated and insulated. The new system also was designed to ventilate outside the plane any smoke that would come from overheating batteries. The grounding was lifted at the end of April. Since the dramatic ANA incident, Dreamliner's list of problems has gone on to include a United Airlines emergency landing in Houston caused by brake problems and a fire started by an emergency locator beacon on an Ethiopian Airlines 787 at Heathrow Airport. United flights were diverted as a precaution last summer due to a faulty fuel pump indicator and an oil level indicator. As well as being lighter and more fuel efficient than similar aircraft, the Dreamliner's in-cabin experience is also different. It has bigger windows that can be dimmed (out go the pull-down shutters), LED mood lighting and is pressurized at 6,000 feet rather than 8,000 feet, making air sickness less likely. Another new airplane . The 787-9 won't be the final iteration of the 787 aircraft. In June, Boeing announced the launch of the 787-10 Dreamliner. Final assembly and flight tests are scheduled to begin in 2017, with first delivery tentatively scheduled in 2018. The company said the 787-10 will fly up to 7,000 nautical miles and have seating for 300-330 passengers.

"Editor's note: Gloria Borger is a senior political analyst for CNN, appearing regularly on CNN's ""The Situation Room,"" ""Campbell Brown: No Bias, No Bull,"" ""AC360°,"" and ""State of the Union With John King,"" as well as special event coverage. Newt Gingrich became the target of his own party's ire for calling Sotomayor a racist. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Well, well. After initially waiting a few nanoseconds to call Supreme Court nominee Judge Sonia Sotomayor a racist -- not to mention advising that she just ought to withdraw from consideration -- Newt Gingrich has had a sudden change of heart. Or at least vocabulary. In the conservative magazine Human Events, he writes on Wednesday: ""My initial reaction was strong and direct -- perhaps too strong and too direct. ... Since then, some who want to have an open and honest consideration of Judge Sotomayor's fitness to serve on the nation's highest court have been critical of my word choice. ... The word 'racist' should not have been applied to Judge Sotomayor as a person, even if her words themselves are unacceptable."" An apology from Newt? And one that contains a string of thoughts too long to Twitter? How can that be? It seems as if poor Gingrich found himself the target of his own Republican Party. Some of the more serious folks in the Senate had been trying to figure out what kind of a jurist Sotomayor might be, when Newt and Rush Limbaugh decided to morph into Thelma and Louise. Their favorite topic? Sotomayor's now infamous statement that, ""I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life."" Foolish, yes. Self-serving, sure. But Gingrich and Co. just couldn't leave it at that. Personal name-calling is just so much more fun -- and attention-getting. So she became a racist (even a reverse racist), in their words. Not surprisingly, Republican senators trying to figure out a way to mount real questions about her judicial record were appalled. One Senate Republican told me that the GOP caucus grew increasingly furious at Gingrich's grandstanding. ""People are really angry,"" the senator says. ""Newt and Rush have simply made it far more difficult for Republicans to raise the legitimate issues. They're so quick to throw the word racist around, they look ugly, and make us look the same way."" And ugly is not a good place to be when you've just resoundingly lost an election -- with less than one-third of the Hispanic vote. If it stays at that level, Republicans will have a hard time winning elections in key red states with growing Hispanic populations. ""Is calling her names our best talking point?"" asks GOP pollster Tony Fabrizio. ""It's a symptom of being leaderless; it's every man for himself these days."" The point, he says, is not to question whether Sotomayor is qualified to sit on the court. After all, after 17 years on the bench, there's no doubt she has the right resume. The right question to ask, Fabrizio rightly argues, is this: How is she going to fill that seat? And then there's this: Instead of throwing around terms like ""judicial activist,"" why not actually examine her record and look for things that might have some real meaning for the American people? In these economic times, the old culture wars arguments against judges as a group of evil-doers ready to 'legislate from the bench' holds much less sway. ""It's got to be about a question of fairness when people are suffering economic anxiety,"" says Fabrizio, who looks to the New Haven firefighters case as good fodder for discussion. In that case, the city denied promotions to a largely white group of firefighters after a civil service exam in which none of the black employees who took the test would have been promoted. ""These people studied for a test, passed it and didn't get their promotions,"" Fabrizio says. And if the high court overturns Sotomayor's ruling -- which some say is likely -- the decision would only make the case more incendiary. And that's a fair discussion to have. But it should also be held in the context of the judge's voluminous record. Tom Goldstein of the respected Scotusblog has done our work for us in examining the firefighters case plus 96 other race-related cases Sotomayor ruled on while on the Court of Appeals. Goldstein's findings hardly show the mark of a jurist who is looking for discrimination above all else. The judge and the panel rejected the claim of discrimination 78 times and found it to be accurate in 10 cases. Nine of those cases were decided unanimously. Overall, he calculates, ""Judge Sotomayor rejected discrimination-related claims by a margin of roughly 8 to 1."" All in all, Goldstein writes, in an 11-year career on the Second Circuit, the judge ""has participated in roughly 100 panel decisions involving questions of race and has disagreed with her colleagues in those cases ... a total of four times."" Four times? Is that a legal activist? A reverse racist? A racist? Or even an extremist? Hardly. Note to Newt: Need new adjectives. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gloria Borger.","Gloria Borger: Newt Gingrich backed off his charge Sonia Sotomayor is a racist .
She says Gingrich angered Senate Republicans with his harsh language .

"(CNN) -- A photo showing Iranian clerics prominently participating in an anti-government protest speaks volumes about the new face of Iran's opposition movement. Clerics in robes and turbans join rallies to protest the disputed presidential election results in Iran. In a blatant act of defiance, a group of Mullahs took to the streets of Tehran, to protest election results that returned incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to power. Whether these clerics voted for Ahmadinejad or one of the opposition candidates is unknown. What is important here, is the decision to march against the will of Iran's supreme leader who called the results final and declared demonstrations illegal. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, Mullahs rule supreme. They are the country's conservative clerics; the guardians of the Islamic revolution and its ideologies. They're loyal only to God and Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Iranian opposition supporters took to the streets in protest of their candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi's loss in the June 12 presidential elections. They alleged the elections were rigged. Moussavi asked to annul the results and hold new vote. Ayatollah Khamenei rejected the proposal, backed Ahmadinejad and called on people not to demonstrate or else face the consequences. When the protests began, Iranian students for the most part, especially women were visible and in the lead.  Watch clerics join the protests » . Their numbers dwindled over time. Some blame police and militia crackdown and intimidation. Social networks swelled with amateur video showing protesters beaten or shot at. Their screams of pain and even death were caught on tape by fellow protesters using mainly cell phone cameras. Throughout all that, some clerics of the Islamic Republic have spoken up against the stifling of people's right to voice their opinion and in support of new elections. On his Web site, Grand Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri described government efforts to crackdown on the protests as threatening the legitimacy of the Islamic Republic because it was no longer representing all the people. Moussavi ally and former president Mohammad Khatami also said in a statement that to ""protest in a civil manner... is the definite right of the people and all must respect that."" The graphic pictures out of Iran in the past week have shown time and again, making statements is one thing and taking to the streets is another. Iranian opposition at the leadership level and in the streets now has new faces, made up of those who had opposing ideologies before the election. One symbol of that has become a nightly tradition in Iran. Secular or religious, Iranians go to their rooftops every night.. and shout out ""Allahu Akbar"" -- God is great -- and ""down with the dictator.""","A group of Mullahs protesting election results represents a blatant act of defiance .

"(CNN) -- The suspected mastermind of the deadly 2012 attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, is expected to be brought to American soil as soon as this weekend, a senior law enforcement source told CNN on Thursday. Ahmed Abu Khatallah was lured earlier this month to a location south of the city in eastern Libya and grabbed without a fight by U.S. commandos and FBI agents, multiple officials said. He's spent most of the past two weeks aboard the USS New York being interrogated by the FBI-led High Value Detainee Interrogation Group, known as HIG, that includes agents from the FBI, CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency. As that vessel -- an amphibious transport dock ship -- nears the coast, it is expected that Abu Khatallah will be flown off of it on a V-22 Osprey aircraft to an undisclosed location, where he will be held as he awaits prosecution in a federal court in Washington. The Justice Department is expected to announce a formal indictment of Abu Khatallah soon after he arrives in the United States. Already, a federal judge has unsealed charges accusing Abu Khatallah of killing a person in the course of an attack on a federal facility with a firearm and dangerous weapons, as well as attempting and conspiring to provide material support to terrorists resulting in death. Abu Khatallah is accused in connection with the September 11, 2012, attack that left U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other U.S. citizens dead. President Barack Obama has described Abu Khatallah as ""one of the masterminds of the attack."" ""It's a message to the world, that when Americans are attacked, no matter how long it takes, we will find those responsible and we will bring them to justice. Regardless how long it takes, we will find you,"" the President said earlier this month. Republicans, though, have hammered Obama and members of his administration on Benghazi -- claiming they didn't do enough to protect the diplomatic mission and have since covered up what happened. Some GOP lawmakers criticized the Justice Department for failing to bring Abu Khatallah to justice even as he taunted U.S. authorities in a meeting with CNN's Arwa Damon at a well-known luxury hotel in Benghazi in May 2013. Chief among those targeted by Republicans is Hillary Clinton, secretary of state at the time of the attack and now the overwhelming favorite for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, if she opts to run. She and administration officials have repeatedly denied the GOP allegations about Benghazi. After news broke of Abu Khatallah's capture, Clinton said she was ""very pleased"" and hopefully it will shed more light on what happened. ""I'm still looking for answers,"" she added. ""We're doing our best we can to find out what happened.""

"(CNN) -- Iran has made a significant advancement in its nuclear program with the completion of its underground uranium enrichment facility near the holy city of Qom, according to a report released Friday by a United Nations watchdog group. The International Atomic Energy Agency report stated Iran has now installed all of the nearly 2,800 centrifuges it will use to enrich uranium at the Fordow plant, but not all the centrifuges are operational. The IAEA also says Iran has increased its stockpile of both 5% and 20% enriched uranium, which can more readily be converted to a weapons grade level. Iran maintains its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but the United States, Israel and other nations contend Iran seeks to build nuclear weapons. The Fordow facility was built into the side of a mountain, making it less vulnerable to attack. Israel has made it clear that completion of the plant could make it difficult to stop Iran if it decides to go ahead and build nuclear explosives. Iran still not cooperating with nuclear inspectors . In August, the agency reported that Iran had stepped up its production of high-grade enriched uranium and had relandscaped one of its military bases in an apparent effort to hamper a U.N. inquiry into its nuclear program. Friday's report said Iran still hasn't allowed the agency access to the military site, called Parchin. The agency has been seeking access since January. The new report repeated the conclusion reached in August that ""extensive activities"" at the Parchin site are certain to have ""seriously undermined"" the agency's verification process. Those activities include ""significant ground scraping and landscaping"" with new dirt roads, the August report said. Many Western diplomats and nuclear experts believe the Parchin site has been secretly used to test high-explosive nuclear triggers, an essential step toward achieving a weapons capability. Iran denies that Parchin has any role in its nuclear program. ""The agency reiterates its request that Iran, without further delay, provide both access to that location and substantive answers to the agency's detailed questions regarding the Parchin site,"" Friday's report said. ""Given the nature and extent of credible information available, the agency continues to consider it essential for Iran to engage with the agency without further delay on the substance of the agency's concerns,"" the report said. The IAEA once again stated that Iran is not cooperating sufficiently with the agency for it to conclude that the country is conducting ""peaceful activities."" The agency said that despite its effort to step up talks with Iran, the nation has offered no ""concrete results."" The agency's director general is, in turn, ""unable to report any progress on clarifying issues relating to possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear programme,"" the report said. IAEA and Iranian officials have scheduled a December 13 meeting in Tehran to address the ongoing issues in the country's nuclear program, the report said. Putting a price on war with Iran .

"(CNN) -- A malfunctioning jet engine on an Air Canada flight caused burning hot debris to fall to the ground after takeoff, an official with Canada's Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday. The incident Monday, which involved Air Canada Flight 001 bound for Tokyo from Toronto with 318 passengers and 16 crew members aboard, damaged vehicles on the ground and forced the Boeing 777 to return to Toronto. No injuries were reported. Don Enns, a regional manager at the independent Transportation Safety Board of Canada, told CTV and CP24 on Tuesday that ""some sort of failure"" inside one of the plane's two engines disrupted the airflow, causing part of the turbine section to fly out the back. ""Those pieces as they were liberated from the engine, they came out the back of the engine,"" Enns said. ""Essentially, it just fell out the back of the engine, fell down, and unfortunately, we had cars underneath them."" He called such an occurrence ""very rare,"" saying the last time he could remember a similar incident was a decade or more ago. Engineers would dismantle the engine involved and study similar engines to try to learn why the malfunction occurred, Enns said. Boeing said in a statement that it ""stands ready to assist the Canadian regulator, if we are asked to participate. Per international rules Boeing has to be asked by the regular to participate in the investigation."" Boeing said it would provide technical expertise about the airport and ""The engine manufacturer, GE, will have a similar role."" For its part, GE said in a statement that it had sent a technical representative to Toronto for the investigation. ""The GE90 engine model powering this aircraft is among the world's most reliable engines ... The GE90 engine fleet, with more than 1,400 engines in airline service, has accumulated close to 30 million flight hours and no aviation accident has ever been attributed to the engine,"" the GE statement said. The flight took off 2:10 p.m. ET Monday, but one engine then shut down, prompting the flight crew to follow ""standard procedure"" and return to Toronto Pearson International Airport, said Air Canada spokesman Peter Fitzpatrick. The crew requested an emergency landing, which Fitzpatrick said was standard because it gives certain planes first priority, though he also noted the aircraft involved is designed to run on a single engine if necessary. The plane landed normally, and passengers returned to the gate, according to Fitzpatrick. Constable George Tudos, spokesman for police in the regional municipality of Peel, said the aircraft returned to Toronto's airport at 3:53 p.m. More than an hour before that, around 2:30 p.m., people began reporting seeing smoke, and one spotted what may have been debris coming from a large airliner, according to Tudos. At least three vehicles on the ground were being investigated for damage. Sarabjit Sandhu told CP24, a CNN affiliate, that she and her husband had just gotten gas at a Petro-Canada station in Mississauga, outside Toronto, when they ""heard a big noise, a bump, like boom."" A number of vehicles in the service station's parking lot were damaged, including a Nissan Altima with its back window shattered to pieces while its owner was inside the station's convenience store. Pieces of gray, heavy material littered the scene, according to CP24. ""It was so hot you couldn't even touch it,"" Sandhu said of the debris.","An Air Canada flight had to return after takeoff from Toronto due to engine failure .
One engine malfunctioned, sending debris out the back, an official says .
The cause of the malfunction will be investigated .
No injuries were reported, but some cars were damaged ."

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Over the last six months, Iran has evaded U.S. sanctions by importing Turkish gold to pay for billions of dollars worth of energy sales to Turkey. Turkey's deputy prime minister has described what amounts to a gold-for-oil barter system. Read more: Turkey: Facing a soft landing or serious turbulence? ""Why did, all of the sudden, Turkey's gold exports, especially gold bullion, go up?"" Ali Babacan asked while speaking before a parliamentary budget commission this month. The official transcript of his statements was published by a Turkish government website Wednesday. ""An important part of that is Iran,"" he said. ""When Turkey buys Iranian oil, we pay for it in Turkish lira. ... However, it is not possible for Iran to take that money as dollars into its own country due to international restrictions, the U.S.A.'s sanctions. Therefore, when Iran cannot take this money back as currency, they withdraw Turkish lira and buy gold from our market. They take the gold back to their own country."" Read more: Turkey boom dampened by Europe's troubles . According to Turkish government statistics, Iran has imported billions of dollars worth of gold from Turkey since it was ejected from the SWIFT international electronic banking system in March. Babacan's rhetorical question and answer resolved suspicions that Turkish economists have had for months, after they noticed an enormous spike in Turkey's gold exports to Iran in April. CNN Blog: Turkey's changing world . ""Our gold has always been there, the Iranians never paid any attention to it up until the last year when they were kicked out of the SWIFT banking system,"" said Atilla Yesilada, an economic analyst with Global Source Turkey. The Turkish government reported that Iran leapt to first place among Turkey's export markets in April. That month, Turkey exported $1.2 billion in gold to Iran, a 438.2% jump from the previous year. ""Turkey is the big hole, the big gap in the wall of sanctions,"" Yesilada said. He was pointing to the U.S.-led campaign to impose an economic blockade on Iran. Many economists say Washington has effectively declared economic war on Iran because of disagreements over its controversial nuclear program. The U.S. accuses Iran of secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons, charges that Tehran has long denied. Read more: Press freedoms watchdog slams Turkish government . Since the sanctions have been unilaterally imposed by Washington, Turkey is not breaking any international law by trading oil for gold with Iran. But in doing so, the Turks risk incurring the wrath of the U.S. government, an important military and political ally. ""At the end of July, the President issued an order that authorizes Treasury to impose sanctions on anyone who helps the Government of Iran acquire U.S. dollars or precious metals, including gold,"" a U.S. Treasury Department spokesman wrote to CNN this week, on condition he not be named. ""We can't comment on any investigations that may be ongoing."" Economists say the gold-for-oil trade shows the sanctions are hurting Iran. ""This is very, very 19th century, taking gold around to manage your international sanctions,"" said Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, a professor of economics at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute. ""Iran lost its ability to sell oil, get electronic credit and use that to buy other stuff."" There has been a great deal of speculation about how the gold is physically being transferred from Turkey to Iran. Those questions extend also to the United Arab Emirates. In August, Turkish government statistics show that the UAE suddenly replaced Iran as Turkey's chief export market. However, the main Turkish export to the UAE was gold -- $1.9 billion worth in August alone. Dubai has traditionally been the world's most important economic gateway to Iran. In his appearance before the parliamentary commission, Deputy Prime Minister Babacan declined to comment on the logistics of the gold shipments. Instead, unconfirmed stories have swirled in the Turkish media of gold bullion being hand-carried out of the country in suitcases. ""We need to be more transparent about what Iran is doing with those gold bars, which apparently are being transported by physical couriers using 50-kilo (110-pound) bags, which is the limit of how much gold you can take out of Turkey,"" said Yesilada, the Turkish economist. ""There are really several James Bondian-like aspects to this, which no government would engage in, in an official or commercial transaction."" ""The picture looks like a James Bond movie. You have individuals with black suitcases carrying gold,"" said Behzad Yaghmaian, an Iranian-American political economist at Ramapo College. ""This could not have happened in any form without the knowledge of the Turkish state. This amount could not have left the country to go to Iran without the state knowing about it."" The Turkish government has not responded to a written request from CNN to comment on the gold trade. Some concerned observers worry the economic intrigue threatens to draw attention from the growing impact the U.S.-led sanctions are having on ordinary Iranians. ""Sanctions are a form of collective punishment on the Iranian people,"" said Yaghmaian, the author of ""Social Change in Iran: An Eyewitness Account of Dissent, Defiance and New Movements for Rights."" ""Iranians who oppose the Islamic Republic (of Iran), who have been under pressure by the Islamic Republic, who have been subjected to different forms of violence by the Islamic Republic, are once again facing a new form of violence that is economic violence."" Iranians have watched their buying power collapse over the last year, as the value of the Iranian rial plunged. There have also been reports of shortages of foreign pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, since Iranian companies have found it next to impossible to pay foreign suppliers because of restrictions on international banking.","Deputy prime minister describes what amounts to a gold-for-oil barter system .

"(CNN) -- The death toll from a cholera outbreak in Haiti has risen to more than 150 confirmed deaths, according to health officials with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the U.S. Agency for International Development. At a joint news conference held Friday, Dr. Rob Quick and Dr. Carleene Dei discussed the outbreak and efforts to work out a containment strategy. The CDC will send an 11-member team to Haiti over the next few days to find out which antibiotics will be most effective in treating the cholera outbreak. US AID will provide supplies needed to set up treatment centers. The group has already prepositioned 300,000 oral re-hydration kits and are distributing water purification kits in affected areas. Officials also confirmed that all the reported cases are in the Artibonite and Central Plateau regions, north of Port-au-Prince. They said they're working to contain the outbreak there and prevent its spread to the densely populated capital. Chaos reigned acrooss the Artibonite and Central Plateau regions Friday, as hospitals overflowed with people rushing to get help from the fast-moving cholera outbreak. Eric Lotz, Haiti's national director for the nonprofit Operation Blessing, described a ""horrific"" scene outside St. Nicolas hospital, the main medical facility in the city of St. Marc, as patients and their family members fought to get care. ""There was bedlam outside the gate,"" said Lotz. ""Inside (the hospital), every square inch is covered with people."" Some people waited 24 hours or more to get help outside the hospital, many of them on stretchers, said Terry Snow, Haiti director for the nonprofit Youth With a Mission. Snow said he tried to take one man with cholera to various clinics, only to end up at St. Nicolas hospital and be told that it was full. The man died soon thereafter in the back of his truck, he said. ""It's very chaotic,"" Snow said of the scene in St. Marc and more rural agricultural areas nearby. ""People are trying to figure out what to do. People are lost."" Sandrellie Seraphin, who works for Partners in Health and the Clinton Foundation, visited the hospital Wednesday. ""It's terrible,"" she told CNN by phone, describing the crowds of people trying to get help. ""There's a great fear among the people"" about the disease. 1,526 people have been sickened in the outbreak, said Imogen Wall, the U.N. humanitarian spokeswoman in Haiti. This comes after recent heavy rains caused the banks of the Artibonite River to overflow and flood the area. Dammed in 1956 to create Lac de Peligre, the Artibonite River is Haiti's dominant drainage system, according to the U.S. Library of Congress. Snow said that ""constant miscommunication and confusion"" have hindered aid efforts, though he expressed hope things may improve Friday as more help comes in. On Friday, Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive called the cholera outbreak ""unprecedented"" and said authorities were working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to understand what happened. ""We have to determine ... where (the cholera) came from,"" he said. Cholera is caused by a bacterial infection of the intestine and, in severe cases, is characterized by diarrhea, vomiting and leg cramps, according to the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In such cases, rapid loss of body fluids can lead to dehydration and shock. ""Without treatment, death can occur within hours,"" the agency says. A person can get cholera by drinking water or eating food contaminated with the bacteria. During epidemics, the source of the contamination is often the feces of an infected person, and infections can spread rapidly in areas where there is poor sewage treatment and a lack of clean drinking water, according to the CDC. ""If the environmental conditions are not right, anybody who ingests that food or water can get ill,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. ""This is the disease that can cause more severe dehydration than any other."" All the reported cases in the Lower Artibonite involve severe diarrhea and vomiting, Wall said. Ian Rawson, director of Hopital Albert Schweitzer Haiti near Verrettes, said patients began showing cholera-like symptoms Saturday. The pace picked up significantly Tuesday and beyond, though he said the situation was under control Friday at his 80-bed facility about 16 miles east of Saint Marc. ""So far, we've been able to manage it,"" Rawson said, noting that new patients were now coming in via pick-up trucks about every 10 minutes. Temperatures in the mid-90s exacerbated the dual concerns about dehydration and people contracting cholera by drinking tainted water. People lined roadsides in and around villages with buckets, according to Lotz, hoping that passerby might have clean water. He said that his organization on Thursday helped install one water filtration unit, capable of providing 10,000 gallons of clean drinking water, and planned to install another two Friday. But some parts of the impoverished nation remained out of reach, he said. One village had been totally cut off by floodwater. Operation Blessing was among many nonprofit organizations, nations and international bodies in the region offering help. In a State Department briefing Friday, spokesman P.J. Crowley said members of several U.S. agencies were ""on the ground"" to facilitate and provide clean water and ensure sound sanitization. U.N. staff, too, have sent tents and rehydration supplies to the region, Wall said. Haiti is still trying to bounce back from a catastrophic 7.0-magnitude earthquake on January 12 that destroyed much of the capital city. The U.N. mission in Haiti credited access to clean water and free medical facilities for preventing feared outbreaks of cholera and tuberculosis. But Snow said he has noticed a rise in new illnesses -- from skin infections to flu-like viruses -- in the region since tens of thousands of people moved to the area after the earthquake and the opening of a new canal off the Artibonite River. Whatever the cause, Lotz said the scene this week at hospitals in and around St. Marc eerily resembled what happened in Port-au-Prince after the colossal quake. ""It's the same scene, without the wounds, just the same numbers of people inundating the hospital,"" said Lotz, who was in the Haitian capital last January.

"Niamey, Niger (CNN) -- An Islamist militant group has claimed responsibility for Thursday's deadly attacks on an army barracks and a uranium mine in Niger, saying they were responses to Niger's cooperation with France in a ""war against Sharia,"" CNN affiliate BFMTV reported. Twenty soldiers and five assailants were killed, and at least 30 other people -- including civilians -- were injured in attacks about 200 kilometers (124 miles) apart in Niger early Thursday, the African nation's defense minister said. Karidjo Mahamadou said later security forces were in charge of the two sites, including one where an attacker had taken hostages. ""I ensure that the situation is under control and that the Niger security forces have renewed the vow to secure the country and the people,"" he said. A spokesman for the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa, or MUJAO, said that ""thanks to Allah, we have carried two operations against the enemies of Islam in Niger,"" BFMTV reported. MUJAO is among the radical Islamist groups that have been fighting Malian and French forces in Mali, which borders Niger. Both attacks -- at the army barracks in Agadez in central Niger and a Somair uranium mine in Arlit in northern Niger -- happened about 5 a.m., Niger Domestic Affairs Minister Abdou Labo said. In Agadez, a regional capital to the southeast of Arlit, a truck carrying armed assailants and explosives detonated in front of the army barracks, Labo said. A battle ensued in which the 20 soldiers were killed, Labo said. A breakdown of how many deaths were attributable to the bombing and how many happened in the battle wasn't available. The surviving assailant closed himself in a building with cadets and threatened to detonate explosives, Labo said. Mahamadou didn't say whether the suspect had been captured when he said everything was under control. At the Somair mine, operated by French nuclear power group Areva, a truck with explosives blew up at the gates, killing two assailants, Labo said. At least 14 civilians were wounded, Mahamadou said. Areva said the injured included at least 13 workers. MUJAO spokesman Abu Walid Sahraoui said the group ""attacked France and Niger for its cooperation with France in the war against Sharia,"" BFMTV reported Thursday. France deployed about 4,000 troops to Mali, the country directly to Niger's west, in January to drive out Islamist militants -- including MUJAO members -- who had attempted to take control of the country. Islamic extremists with links to al Qaeda carved out a large portion of northern Mali last year, taking advantage of a chaotic situation after a military coup in March 2012. France took military action this year after the militants began to push into the southern portion of the country. MUJAO is a splinter group of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, according to the United Nations. France strongly condemned Thursday's attacks, the French foreign ministry said. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius spoke with his Nigerien counterpart and expressed France's solidarity with Nigerien authorities in the fight against terrorist groups, the ministry said. Niger, a former colony of France, gained independence in 1960. Journalist Ibbo Daddy Abdoulaye reported from Niamey, Niger. CNN's Jason Hanna and Pierre Meilhan reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Amir Ahmed also contributed to this report.","NEW: 20 soldiers, five assailants dead after another bombing, battle .

"(CNN) -- They have tours designed around them, statues erected in their honor and fans so rabid many a sports team would envy them. The world's most adorable city mascots have some heady responsibilities and impressive lines on their CVs, from running a train station to gracing a ""Vanity Fair"" cover with Hollywood elite. But cuteness alone didn't get them their celebrity. Their stories did. 1. Shrek the Unshearable Sheep (Tarras, New Zealand) Shrek, a merino sheep from the small New Zealand farming settlement of Tarras, gained a following in 2004 after word got out he'd avoided grooming for six years by hiding in a cave. Named Shrek for the ogre he resembled in his matted state, he quickly charmed the nation. After his capture, a national TV station broadcast the 20-minute shearing of the iconic kiwi live. During the shave, Shrek shed 27 kilograms (about 60 pounds) of fleece, enough to make 20 large wool men's suits. The fleece was auctioned in 2004 for children's medical charities. Shrek became so famous he got to meet New Zealand's prime minister. In 2007, he spent his 10th birthday on an iceberg off the coast of New Zealand, where the celebrisheep underwent his second big trim. At age 16 he began suffering pain from age-related illnesses and was put down. His legacy in Tarras and New Zealand lives on in legend. Special power: Living in darkness. Potential motto: ""It's just in that awkward, in-between phase."" 2. Fungie the Dolphin (Dingle, Ireland) He may not be a household name globally, but Fungie's a big deal in the tiny town of Dingle on the west coast of Ireland. The 13-foot resident bottlenose made Dingle harbor his home in 1983 and is known for playing around boats and swimmers. Recently, a second dolphin was spotted in the harbor. Local lore has it that it's Fungie's former lover, returning to the dolphin of her dreams after many years. Dingle runs daily Fungie-spotting boat tours ($23 adults; $12 children) and even offers Fungie wedding packages. According to his official website, celebrities such as fellow Irishman Pierce Brosnan have come to see Fungie. ""Although there is no meaning in the Irish language for the word 'Fungie,' it does suggest he is a Fun-Guy,"" the site says. Special power: Sticking around. Potential motto: ""Fungie by name, fun guy by nature!"" 3. Patrick the Wombat (Ballarat, Victoria, Australia) At 28 years old and almost 84 pounds, Patrick the wombat of Australia's Ballarat Wildlife Park is the oldest and largest Common Wombat known in captivity, having outlived the average wombat in the wild by 13 years (so far). The longtime resident of Victoria acts as the ""wombassador"" to the wildlife park, where he gets wheel-barrowed about the park by staff. Rapt visitors have included Nicolas Cage, Kirstie Alley and Kim Cattrall. A local celebrity, he became a Reddit phenomenon when his photo blew up on the site in 2013. On October 22, the town will honor him for Australia's 10th annual Wombat Day -- also known as ""Hug a Wombie Day"" -- an unofficial holiday designed to celebrate all of Australia's wombats. Special power: Staying alive. Potential motto: ""I'm old, fat and hairy and wouldn't change a thing."" 4. Tama the Station Master (Kinokawa, Wakayama, Japan) In Japan, cats have their own islands, their own cafes and their own careers. Tama, a 15-year-old female calico from the streets of Kinokawa, pawed her way to fame and fortune at the small rail station of Kishi in Japan. The unclaimed puss became a familiar face near the tracks, and after a while, was adopted by the station manager. Three years later, Tama took her owner's job. Tama's mascot duties as official station master and deputy president include greeting passengers, wearing a station master hat and eating. Tens of thousands of tourists trek to the tiny train town each year to see the cat and the Tama-themed station, featuring a Tama train, Tama souvenir shop, Tama cafe and even a building resembling a cat's face. Special power: Ambition. Potential motto: ""It's a dog-eat-dog world. Let a cat handle it."" 5. The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill (San Francisco) A pandemonium of approximately 200 conure parrots reside in a park in the San Francisco neighborhood of Telegraph Hill, far from their native home in South America. Having become a city staple and stars of the 2003 documentary ""The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill,"" they have their own fan club and entries devoted to them in San Francisco travel guides. Although their origin is uncertain, it's thought the first of these parrots congregated on the hill after escaping from captivity -- millions were brought into the United States before restrictions were placed on wild parrot imports in 1993. Special power: Finding cheap accommodation in San Francisco. Potential motto: ""Freedom fliers unite!"" 6. Cute Knut (Berlin) Abandonment, love, celebrity, incest ... the story of ""Cute Knut,"" the polar bear born in the Berlin Zoo in 2006 packs more drama than any Lifetime special. Rejected at birth by his mother, a former circus performer named Tosca from East Germany, Knut the eisbar (""polar bear"" in German) was left alone after his twin brother died at just four days old. When his story and picture hit national media, it melted German hearts and sparked an international sensation. His first public appearance brought hordes of Berliners and hundreds of journalists to the Berlin Zoo. He subsequently graced postcards and stamps, inspired a Nutella knockoff called ""Knutella"" and had stuffed animals created in his likeness. He was even photographed by Annie Leibovitz and superimposed onto a ""Vanity Fair"" cover featuring Leonardo DiCaprio. The Berlin Zoo capitalized on the city's Knutmania by officially registering Knut as a trademark. But when the adorable little bear grew up, his adoring public turned. Knut became plagued by rumors of incest when his polar bear girlfriend turned out to be a distant relative, and was bullied by fellow bears including his own mother. Like many childhood celebrities, he was unable to deal with the fame. Gawker even likened his meltdown to that of Britney Spears. On March 19, 2011, when he was but four years old, Knut collapsed into his pool and died. An outpouring of grief ensued with flowers, memorials and a statement from the mayor. A sculpture of the bear using Knut's fur was exhibited in Berlin's Museum of Natural History. Special power: Tear jerking. Potential motto: ""Ich bin ein bearliner."" 7. Hamish McHamish the Cool Cat (St. Andrews, Scotland) The 17,000-person Scottish town of St. Andrews is hovering dangerously close to idolatry in regards to its collective pet, ginger furball, Hamish McHamish. Starting when he was a young, rebellious kitten 14 years ago, McHamish would leave home to voyage regularly into local eateries, bookstores and homes. The town fell for him hard. In April, St. Andrews erected a resident-funded $8,000 cast bronze statue of the cat to honor their beloved friend. A biography -- ""Hamish McHamish, Cool Cat About Town"" -- was published this year. The local celeb regularly updates his busy goings on about town on Twitter. ""Spending my evening watching Flashdance on DVD. #whatafeeling"" and ""I'm in Drouthies if anyone fancies [buying me] a drink. #gasping,"" are some recent tweets. Special power: Posturing with style. Motto: ""Once I had an owner. Now I have a staff."" 8. Mike the Headless Chicken (Fruita, Colorado) A famed headless fowl named Mike has become an icon in the farm town of Fruita, Colorado. Back in 1945, the Wyandotte rooster continued to live for 18 months after a farmer's wife chopped off its head. She was hoping for a chicken dinner, but instead got the shock of her life as the headless chicken strutted off. According to an article in ""LIFE"" magazine from 1945, the ax managed to ""clip off most of the skull but leave intact one ear, the jugular vein and the base of the brain, which controls motor function."" Mike became a popular sideshow attraction, and owners even supposedly insured the chicken for $10,000. The headless chicken finally passed away in 1946 in an Arizona motel from health complications. Now Fruita remembers its town chicken every May with a Mike the Headless Chicken Festival and a Mike the Headless Chicken 5K. Special power: Surviving a beheading.

"Obo, Central African Republic (CNN) -- The lush, green forests of central Africa have long been the playground and refuge of the continent's most-notorious warlord, Joseph Kony. His Lord's Resistance Army, which began with the aim of overthrowing the Ugandan government, has since spread to remote hinterlands on the borders of the Central African Republic, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Though officials don't know exactly where Kony is, U.S. troops have been sent to the area to help find and defeat the LRA leader. They have made progress. But as CNN has learned, much work remains to be done -- both to locate Kony and to restore a sense of stability and safety to the region. ""Kony is definitely still a threat. He's been on the run. He's on the decline, and in survival mode, but he is still dangerous and he's going to be dangerous until the LRA are eliminated,"" said a captain with U.S. Special Forces. The captain, who CNN agreed not to identify because of concerns for his safety, spoke in Obo, a village in the Central African Republic. President Barack Obama directed the deployment of about 100 troops to central Africa last year to help hunt down leaders of the LRA. Distributed among four operating bases, they are advising regional forces. ""We help our partner nation forces ask the right questions -- the who, the what, the when, the where and the why -- to get all the information,"" the captain said. The LRA has been on the run since being scattered from a temporary base in Congolese territory by a botched 2008 U.S.-backed attack on Kony's position, dubbed Operation Lightning Thunder. Since then, LRA attacks have killed 2,400 people and displaced 465,000, according to Resolve Uganda, a nonprofit group that monitors LRA activity. Another 3,400 people have been abducted. Kony, who became a household name when a video about him went viral on the Internet this year, is wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. He and his group are accused of killing and maiming villagers, abducting children and turning them into soldiers or sex slaves. Madelaine Simbachalanio is considered one of the lucky ones. She was abducted by LRA soldiers, but released into the forest once they reached their base camp, she said. Miraculously -- exhausted and terrified -- she made her way home. Many of those taken with her were never seen or heard from again. Part of the difficulty in tracking Kony stems from the fact he can move freely across porous borders, and not all countries in the region have joined the chase, said Ugandan armed forces spokesman Col. Felix Kulayigye. He believes Kony is shuffling between Sudan and the Central African Republic. ""This is the strategy that he has used for the last four to five years. When the pressure is too much here, he runs across the border because he knows we are not allowed to go after him,"" Kulayigye said. ""Whenever pressure is high, he just switches to north Sudan. It hampers our operation."" But a spokesman for the Sudanese information ministry denied the allegation. ""This is completely incorrect,"" said Rabi Abd al-Ati. ""We don't accommodate rebels from Uganda or elsewhere. ... The LRA has no existence in our areas."" Regardless of where Kony is, the hope is that the search to find him will not only lead to his capture, but also bring an end to the long, regional nightmare he unleashed. Despite the presence of troops, some people in Obo say they are still too afraid to sleep in their beds. They sleep in the yard, hiding in the undergrowth outside their houses, because they worry the LRA will come for them in the night. Reclaiming peoples' lives from that fear is as much a part of the job as capturing Kony, said the Special Forces captain. ""I think this mission is a very worthwhile one, and it's going to bring stability to a region that has been without stability for a long time. If we can do anything to help reduce the atrocities, and make the locals feel safe, then, I think, it's definitely worthwhile,"" he said. Journalist Isma'il Kushkush contributed to this report.","Joseph Kony is head of the Lord's Resistance Army .

"(CNN) -- Mitt Romney returned to his native Michigan on Friday where he created a stir with a comment about birth certificates, reopening a thorny issue pushed by some Republicans who question whether President Barack Obama is a U.S.-born citizen, a requisite for the White House. Separately, embattled Republican Congressman Todd Akin formally announced that he would remain in the Missouri senate race despite widespread calls from his party to step down after his controversial remarks about rape and pregnancy. And a new national poll showed Romney and Obama remain deadlocked just days before the opening of the Republican National Convention in Tampa. Appearing in Commerce Township, Michigan, with his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, Romney sought to preview the personal narrative that will be a major focus of next week's nominating convention. He began his stump speech reminding voters of his roots in the Detroit suburbs. ""I love being home in this place where Ann and I were raised, where both of us were born,"" Romney said. ""Ann was born at Henry Ford hospital, I was born at Harper hospital. No one has ever asked to see my birth certificate. They know that this is the place that we were born and raised,"" he said. Although Romney was talking about his own birth certificate, the comment amounted to an indirect zing at Obama and the so-called ""birther"" controversy that has followed him since the last presidential campaign. The thousands who turned out to see Romney roared at the punch line. The White House released Obama's full birth certificate in 2011, showing he was born in a Hawaii hospital on August 4, 1961. Only ""natural born"" citizens of the United States are eligible to be president . In a statement responding to Romney's comments, Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt mentioned real estate magnate Donald Trump and others who have pursued the issue. ""Throughout this campaign, Governor Romney has embraced the most strident voices in his party instead of standing up to them,"" LaBolt said, adding that Romney's ""decision to directly enlist himself in the 'birther' movement should give pause to any rational voter across America."" The Obama campaign used the comment in a campaign appeal to supporters, encouraging them to think about ""what he's actually saying, and what it says about Mitt Romney. Then make a donation of $5 or more to re-elect Barack Obama today."" A Romney aide said after Romney's remarks that the former Massachusetts governor has ""repeatedly said"" that he believes Obama was born in the United States. ""He was only referencing that Michigan, where he is campaigning today, is the state where he himself was born and raised,"" the aide said. The comment resonated with some supporters gathered for the campaign event. ""There's been a lot of talk about it one way or another,"" said Mitzi Pawloski of West Bloomfield, Michigan. ""The truth is Obama probably hasn't released all the documents he could."" Others applauded Romney. ""I thought it was great because why should we have to worry about whether the president has a birth certificate or not,"" said Guy Myers of Clarkston, Michigan. Michigan is a battleground in November. Obama won the state four years ago and authorized the massive taxpayer-sponsored rescue of failing Detroit automakers and suppliers in 2009. Romney's father was a former auto industry executive and governor of the state. He also sought the Republican presidential nomination in 1968. New presidential poll shows virtual tie, Akin remains in race . Separately, a CNN/ORC International poll showed Romney and Obama in a dead heat as the campaign approached its fall stretch drive, placing heavier importance on the Republican gathering that starts Monday and the Democratic convention the week after in Charlotte. According to the survey, 49% of likely voters said they were backing Obama and 47% supported Romney. The margin is within the survey's sampling error, meaning the race is a statistical tie. Further, 48% of likely voters who are independents said they supported Romney, with 45% backing Obama. In the race for Senate in Missouri, Akin told a news conference that he would not abandon his campaign despite widespread calls from fellow Republicans to do so since unleashing a political firestorm in a St. Louis television interviewed aired on Sunday. A six-term member of Congress with deep ties to Christian conservatives, Akin initially apologized and said he would not drop out. He made it official on Friday. ""We are going to be here through the November election, and we are going to be here to win,"" he said. ""I may not be the favorite candidate of some people within the Republican establishment, but the voters made a decision and this is an election, it's not a selection,"" Akin said. Republicans have been counting on Akin, who won a three-way primary fight, to defeat incumbent Democrat Claire McCaskill in the campaign considered crucial for any GOP hopes of capturing control of the Senate. Romney came out more forcefully in an interview, calling the remarks ""deeply offensive."" ""I can't defend what he said; I can't defend him,"" Romney said. More waves before convention, Santorum delegates . With convention planning in the home stretch, Romney's campaign is considering a dramatic scheduling change to guarantee Ann Romney a much larger national audience - but the shift could also cause tensions with a rising GOP star and Latinos, CNN has learned. If Ann Romney is moved from Monday to Thursday night, she would introduce her husband and bump Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida from that role. GOP sources confirm such a move is under consideration but stress that no final decision has been made. A Romney campaign spokeswoman declined to discuss any hypothetical scheduling moves. Ann Romney is considered by many to be one of her husband's strongest surrogates by helping to soften up his image as a calculated businessman. Convention organizers and attendees also watched to see if a storm churning through the Atlantic with ferocious winds and heavy rains would head for western Florida just as 50,000 people open the convention. Planners were confident that Tropical Storm Isaac would not disrupt the four-day event and that Romney would be nominated as scheduled. Romney got some good news on Friday ahead of the convention. Rick Santorum, who at one point was Romney's top challenger for the nomination, officially released his delegates and encouraged them to back the presumptive nominee. Halimah Abdullah, Kevin Bohn, Peter Hamby, John King, Kevin Liptak, and Mark Preston contributed.","Mitt Romney joked about his birth certificate in return to his native Michigan .

"Chicago (CNN) -- A 15-year-old Chicago girl walking to her high school in pre-dawn darkness was hit on the head, dragged between two houses to a yard and raped, police said, with the assault taking place just a half block away from one of the city's ""Safe Passage"" school routes especially for students. The incident put another spotlight on the city's problem with violence. Just this fall, local officials pledged that an expanded Safe Passages program -- with its big yellow signs above sidewalks patrolled during key times by paid, trained workers -- would be a sanctuary for children walking to and from school. Local authorities noted, however, that the 15-year-old victim was walking to school Tuesday morning a half hour before her nearby Safe Passage route was staffed with patrols. The girl was in serious condition Thursday at a hospital. A resident found the girl half-naked and bleeding from the head on a snowy walkway on the side of his home. She lay for about two hours in the cold before she was discovered. She was conscious but barely moving when she was found, authorities said. ""Just opening up the door, and take a morning sweep of the sidewalks and to find something like that is just shocking,"" said Michael Klockowski, the resident on the city's Northwest Side who found the school girl. The snow outside his home was still stained Thursday. Parents and residents are now questioning the safety of the program in a city that has been plagued by gun-related murders. ""Everybody is scared. It can happen to any of our kids, so everybody is worried,"" Ada Cambron, a parent, said Thursday. ""In the morning, you never see police walking around and stuff like that."" When told that police officers were patrolling the Safe Passages on foot on Thursday, Cambron acknowledged the police presence but noted it took the rape of a student to prompt the patrol. ""It shouldn't be that way,"" she said. City and school officials doubled the number of Safe Passage routes this fall to accommodate more children being forced to walk greater distances to school because the school system closed a record 48 elementary schools amid a $1 billion budget shortfall. About 12,000 students are attending new schools this year because of the budget crisis, and many of them must walk through some of Chicago's most violent neighborhoods. Another parent, Sharon Rafael, said she liked the program but was skeptical of its monitoring as she stood outside a school with her small daughter and held a pink ""Pretty Princess Puzzles"" book. ""I think it works, but it just needs a little bit more security on it,"" Rafael said. ""Like, OK, you can patrol it right now, but later on, like in a few weeks, they'll forget about it. And they won't be around anymore."" Ariel Reboyras, the alderman representing the area where the assault occurred, defended the Safe Passage program. The student rape occurred about 6 a.m. when it was still dark outside. ""We can't say it was a result of a problem with Safe Passage, but we know that it's not supposed to happen,"" the alderman said. Police were still searching Thursday for a suspect. CNN's George Howell reported from Chicago, and Michael Martinez wrote and reported from Los Angeles.","A 15-year-old girl is dragged, beaten, raped on her way to high school .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Four jurors in the Michael Jackson wrongful death trial said they feel cheated by the outcome, which they blame on a misleading verdict form. The six-month-long trial ended in October with a victory for AEG Live, the concert promoter Jackson's mother and children had claimed was liable for his death because it hired, retained or supervised the doctor convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the death. The jurors, whose sworn statements were attached to a motion for a new trial filed Thursday by Katherine Jackson's lawyers, said most of the jury wanted to find concert promoter AEG Live liable in Jackson's 2009 death. Along with arguing that the verdict form was faulty, the Jackson lawyers contend the judge erred by refusing to let them pursue a negligence claim independent of the hiring case. AEG not liable in Michael Jackson's death, jury finds . Jackson died from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol on June 25, 2009, which Dr. Conrad Murray told police he used to treat the pop icon's insomnia as he prepared for a tour produced by AEG Live. They jurors used the words ""stunned,"" ""upset"" and ""shocked"" when they were told they had to stop deliberations after a majority agreed that the answer was ""no"" to the second question on the verdict form -- ""Was Dr. Conrad Murray unfit or incompetent to perform the work for which he was hired?"" One juror called the question ""a trap that prevented us from deliberating on the real issues of the case."" ""After sitting through almost six months of the trial in this case, I believed that Mrs. Jackson had proven her case against AEG LIve,"" another juror said. ""Despite this fact, I had no way of voting in favor of the plaintiffs because of the way that the verdict form was worded."" Jackson lawyers, in their arguments for a new trial, contend that Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Yvette Palazeulos erred by denying their request to add the words ""at any time"" to the question. The four jurors, whose names were redacted from the documents released by the court, agreed. ""I would like the judge to know that we did not have the opportunity to deliberate or render a verdict on the plaintiffs claims that Dr Murray did not become unfit or incompetent until after the conflict of interest was created, Dr. Murray's duties were changed, pressures were mounting, or even after the contract was prepared and signed by Dr. Murray,"" one juror said. The jury voted ""no"" only after one member convinced them that the question could have only meant ""at the time he was hired,"" two of the juror statements said. Conrad Murray talks about Michael Jackson's death . ""During our deliberations, I asked to send a question to the judge to explain Question 2, but by then the foreman had already answered 'no' and followed the instructions to sign the form,"" one said. ""I feel so cheated because I sat through five months of trial and listened to a lot of evidence on the ethical conflict created -- yet I never got to even deliberate at all on that issue or even review the hundreds of exhibits that had been brought in."" Another juror said they decided not to ask the judge for direction on the second question because ""we did not want anyone to know where we were in deliberations."" ""I do not believe that the verdict form was fair or worded correctly, and as phrased, Question 2 was a trap that prevented us from deliberating on the real issues of the case,"" a juror said. The same juror described the emotional toll it has caused. ""Since the jury verdict, I have been very upset, and initially I was unable to eat or even check my e-mails because I was so sorry about the verdict and the fact that justice was not done in this case, because of how question 2 on the verdict form was worded."" ""I do not think that justice was achieved in this case,"" another said. The affidavits revealed that one of the 12 jurors refused to stop deliberating despite being told it was over. ""He insisted that we continue answering the rest of the questions,"" a juror said. Judge Palazeulos will hear arguments on the new trial motion on January 3.","Four jurors gave sworn statements to help Katherine Jackson get a new trial .

"(CNN) -- A Nevada man is accused of providing support to terrorism groups in India and Pakistan, authorities said Wednesday. Balwinder Singh, 39, is charged with one count of conspiracy to murder, kidnap, and maim persons in a foreign country; one count of conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists; one count of making a false statement on an immigration document; two counts of use of an immigration document procured by fraud; and one count of unlawful production of an identification document. He was arrested in Reno on Tuesday. Singh is accused of belonging to two terrorist organizations -- Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) and Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF) -- whose members seek to create an independent Sikh state in the Punjab region of India, read the indictment. ""After an extensive investigation, the FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) of Northern Nevada has disrupted an individual's involvement in facilitation activities in support of a foreign terrorist organization, targeting an ally of the United States,"" said FBI Special Agent in Charge Laura A. Bucheit. ""We will continue to work with our international partners to prevent acts of terrorism on U.S. soil or, as in this case, on that of an ally."" According to the indictment, Singh was a citizen of India and fled to the United States where he claimed asylum. He eventually obtained a permanent resident card. He is accused of using a false identity and obtaining false documents in the United States so that he could travel to India without being apprehended by authorities there. Singh sent money from the United States to co-conspirators in India, the indictment read. He is also accused of providing advice on how to carry out acts of terrorism and traveling to Pakistan, India and other countries to meet with co-conspirators. If convicted, Singh faces up to life in prison. He is scheduled to appear in court Friday.","NEW: He could face up to life in prison if convicted .

"(CNN) -- For three decades or so, Syrian artist Safwan Dahoul has been painting pensive, haunting images -- all of which are titled ""Dream"". The somber paintings typically depict a downcast, lone woman, painted in shades of gray or muted colors. A celebrated painter, Dahoul had seen his works acquired by the Syrian Ministry of Culture and the national museum in Damascus. But he now lives in Dubai, joining over two million fellow citizens who fled overseas to escape the brutal civil war. When Dahoul moved to the UAE in 2012, he left behind most of his belongings, including many of his ""Dream"" paintings, at his Damascus home. ""I left with only one small bag, thinking I'd return to Syria after a short time,"" says the 53-year-old artist. Art collector Hisham Samawi and his cousin Khaled Samawi, who run Ayyam Gallery in Dubai, helped Dahoul -- and later his paintings -- leave Syria. The cousins first opened the gallery in Damascus in 2006, but the conflict had forced them to move the headquarters to Dubai around three years ago. Between 2011 and 2013, the Samawis and their team helped more than a dozen Syrian artists relocate overseas, providing them with visas and airfare, and moved about 3,000 artworks to Dubai. ""The moment when trouble started happening in Syria, we decided that we needed to plan because if this thing turned ugly, we're not going to have time to do this later,"" says Hisham Samawi. They also helped 33-year-old artist Tammam Azzam escape to Dubai in September 2011. His work ""Freedom Graffiti"" -- a digitally manipulated image of Gustav Klimt's painting ""The Kiss"" superimposed on a photograph of a bomb-ravaged wall in Syria -- went viral last year after the Saatchi Gallery in London shared it on Facebook. Moving artists and their artworks to safe havens such as Beirut, Dubai and Cairo is a costly operation, but Samawi says it is worth it. ""We feel like we're a family in Ayyam,"" he says. ""So it was never an option that we're going to cut our ties and move on."" But it's not just about rescuing Syrian artistic and cultural treasures, it's also about money. Middle Eastern art is big business, and Dubai is a hub, hosting the region's largest modern art fair. On the first day of Art Dubai last month, Ayyam Gallery sold a ""Dream"" painting by Dahoul for $150,000. ""More and more, we're seeing people engage with artists who are producing work in conflict areas,"" says Bashar Al Shroogi, art collector and director of Dubai-based Cuadro Fine Art Gallery. ""It's because they have a message, it's because they're reflecting back what's happening in the regions. Essentially, they're holding a mirror back to society and saying, 'This is what's going on around me. Do you see what I see?"" Dahoul and Azzam are now living in the safe haven of Dubai, but they are still troubled by the bloodshed and destruction in Syria. Dahoul's more-recent ""Dream"" paintings hint at the atrocities back home: a woman staring at rows of bodies, a body squeezed into a small box. Azzam, whose artworks focus on the devastation back home, says: ""I am a completely different person now in my life and my art -- everything has changed."" Yenni Kwok contributed to this report.","Ayyam Gallery, based in Dubai, helped more than a dozen Syrian artists flee the civil war .

"(CNN) -- Six umpires accused of corruption in an Indian television sting will not be considered for selection, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has confirmed. The ICC launched an ""urgent"" investigation on Monday following an India TV expose which alleged certain officials were willing to fix matches at the recent T20 World Cup in exchange for payment. Two of the accused umpires are Pakistani, two are from Bangladesh and another two are from Sri Lanka -- where the 20-over tournament was held. None of the officials featured in the show were involved in matches at the tournament, which was won by the West Indies on Sunday. ""The International Cricket Council (ICC) and its relevant full member boards have agreed not to appoint any of the umpires named in a sting operation recently conducted by India TV to any domestic or international cricket matches pending the outcome of the ongoing investigations into the allegations made.,"" said an ICC statement. ""The officials named are not contracted by the ICC and those Boards who employ and nominate the umpires directly will conduct the investigations as a matter of urgency."" One of the two Pakistani officials is the only member of the six on the ICC's elite panel. He last took charge of an international match in November 2010. A 48-year-old Bangladeshi umpire has officiated 40 one-day matches and three T20 contests. In November 2011, three Pakistan players were jailed for accepting money to deliberately bowl ""no balls"" in a Test match against England. Former captain Salman Butt and bowlers Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir were also banned from international cricket for five years.","ICC will not select six officials accused of corruption for international duty .

"Tacloban, Philippines (CNN) -- Juvilyn Tanega sits inside her sweltering tent looking at pictures of the children she will never see again. All six died the night of November 8, along with their father and their grandmother. Tanega now lives alone near her own father in the Philippine city of Tacloban, still trying to come to terms with her appalling loss. They died as they tried to shelter from Typhoon Haiyan inside their wood and tin shack. Tanega somehow survived the wall of water that swept away her family and her future. She is one of 100,000 people, according to the United Nations, who now live in tents throughout the region of the central Philippines devastated by one of the strongest storms ever recorded. A staggering one million live in conditions considered by the UN to be unsafe and vulnerable to future storms. ""I want to leave but I can't,"" she says. ""There's nowhere for me to go and I am at the bottom of the list for a new house."" The tragic reality for Tanega is that she is a low priority for a new home because she doesn't have children. The best she hopes for now is to go back to school, get a qualification and try to start a new life somewhere else. Seven months after Haiyan, the city of Tacloban still bares the vivid scars of its destructive path. The airport is still only partially rebuilt, while much of the city is a mix of mangled steel structures, concrete shells that used to be houses, roadside graveyards, tents and crowded temporary homes known as ""bunkhouses"". The 4WD vehicles of aid organizations can been seen everywhere. But Tacloban is not sinking in despair. The city is recovering. Power is mostly restored, the town center once again throbs with business and noise, both the Coca-Cola and Pepsi plants are back in operation and the hotels are open. ""I love Tacloban"" signs are springing up, or are being repainted. At the Alejandro Hotel a sheet hangs from the roof with the words ""Tacloban Tindog"" (""Stand Up Tacloban""). The city is not yet standing tall but it's trying. The biggest single problem is housing. The storm surge destroyed thousands of homes on the coastal strip. Most were shanties. With nowhere else to go, people are rebuilding over the remains of their old houses, using whatever they can scavenge from the wreckage. New timber is in short supply. However they are building exactly where the government doesn't want them to, right in the danger zone. Anything like a repeat of the 8 meters-high wall of water that crashed through the coastal strip would once again wash away these homes. READ MORE: Returning to a city still struggling, but determined . The government initially banned any new building within 40 meters of the sea but that was modified because it was impractical. There are no hard rules about where to rebuild but it is clear that the government sees these new rebuilt homes as temporary. ""It is too dangerous to build back there. It is too exposed,"" says Panfilo Lacson, Presidential Adviser on Rehabilitation and Recovery. ""Yolanda (the local name of Haiyan) is the new normal as far as we are concerned. We have to build places that can stand up to that sort of weather,"" he says. The government is planning to build 200,000 new homes to house a million people. They will be away from the shoreline on land not prone to mudslides and solid enough to withstand the most extreme winds (Haiyan's sustained wind speed was measured at around 199mph / 320kmph). ""We have the money for it,"" says Lacson. But progress has been glacially slow, say the people of Tacloban. The master recovery plan has only just been tabled. Politics, bureaucracy, finding and acquiring suitable land have all contributed to the fact that of the 200,000 homes planned, only about 130 had been completed by the middle of May. ""Building Back Better"" is the government's slogan but that is wearing thin on the streets here. For people like Tanega, the slogans mean nothing. ""We've been waiting a long time. I don't know how long my suffering will go on,"" she says. ""Who do I run to, who do I lean on? I don't have a family, no husband to rely on. I am not important."" The government says it understands and it's ramping up re-development. But now it is a race against time. At the beginning of June the new typhoon season began. And Tacloban and the surrounding area is one of the most typhoon-prone parts of the planet.

"(CNN) -- China's and Japan's top leaders met in Belgium, indicating a thaw in relations since a diplomatic battle broke out last month over Japan's arrest of a Chinese fishing captain off the disputed Diaoyu Islands. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan met Monday in Brussels, on the sidelines of the Asia-Europe Meeting. They met in a corridor outside the conference venue after a working dinner and spoke for about 25 minutes, Kan told reporters, according to Japan's Kyodo news agency. During the meeting, Wen stressed the mutual benefits of Beijing and Tokyo maintaining good relations, according to China's state-run media. Kan said likewise, Kyodo said. Wen and Kan ""agreed to step up people-to-people exchange and communication between the governments, and hold China-Japan high-level meeting at an appropriate time,"" according to the Xinhua news agency. Wen also reiterated China's claims to the Diaoyu Islands, China's state-run media said. Kan told Wen that the islands are an integral part of Japanese territory, Kyodo said. The Japanese call the islands the Senkaku. The arrest of the fishing captain in early September off the islands touched off a battle that escalated into diplomatic threats by Beijing, the suspension of ministerial-level talks and canceled trips between the nations. Beijing says the islands and most of the South China Sea belong to China, disputing neighboring countries' claims. The clash over territorial waters and islands -- and the natural resources that go with them -- is a flash point in the Asia-Pacific region. Japan late last month freed the fishing captain, who returned to a hero's welcome in China. During the dispute, China arrested four Japanese nationals, saying they were being investigated for illegally entering a Chinese military zone. China released three of the four Japanese last week, saying they had made admissions and expressed regret. China continues to hold the remaining Japanese national. Their employer, the Japanese construction company Fujita Corp., has said that they were sent to China for a Japanese government project to reclaim World War II chemical weapons left by Japan's Imperial Army.","NEW: Wen and Kan also reiterated their nations' claims to disputed islands .

"(CNN) -- Video storytelling can be a very powerful thing. Moving images coupled with compelling sound can transport a viewer to a different place, inside the story. To achieve this level of storytelling you must be a technically sound shooter. Here are the basic tools and tips needed to become a great video storyteller. Have a plan . Before you actually start shooting, be sure you have a game plan. Think about your subject and what kind of shots you need to best tell the story. Thinking ahead will help you avoid being overwhelmed when you start shooting. Also, be sure to think about your equipment ahead of time. Be sure to have enough charged batteries and spare memory. There's nothing worse than setting up a shoot only to realize you're out of juice. Don't forget about composition . One thing that is easy to lose sight of during a fast-paced news gathering shoot is composition. This can result in bland, forgettable material. Thoughtful shot composition can really make your footage stand out. Generally, it is boring to just center the subject of your shot, so instead, use the rule of thirds. Pretend your frame has evenly spaced lines running throughout it, two horizontally and two vertically. The points where the lines intersect are where you want to have the most important elements of the shot. If your shot seems boring, try to get up high or down low. Presenting your viewer with an alternative to the shoulder/tripod-height view will help create a more dynamic shot. And don't forget to be creative! Think about what angle a person would not normally see and see how it looks through your camera. Have a focal point . Each shot should have something for the viewer to focus on or else the viewer will focus on nothing. Use the rule of thirds to decide where to put this focal point in your frame. Capture action . It is very important to capture action in your shots, but don't get sucked into following every movement. Allow your subjects to move in and out of the frame, as this gives a much better sense of motion. Get a variety of shots . Always make sure you have the following shots: wide shots to set the scene, medium to give context and to tell the basic story, and tight shots to give details that the viewer wouldn't normally see. Once you have a variety of shots of different scenes, you can start telling a cohesive visual story. Stabilize EVERY shot . Train yourself to always use a tripod or monopod when shooting. Shaky footage can totally distract the view from an otherwise great shot. This takes discipline and tripods can be cumbersome, but your material will improve greatly if stabilized. Limit camera moves . Zooms, pans and tilts. When done carefully and deliberately they can be OK, but most of they time they distract from what should be the focal point of the shot: the action. Pay attention to light . Light is your friend. Beautiful light during the golden hour (first and last hour of sunlight during the day) will be warm and soft, shooting at that time of day will make footage pop. Be aware of light. You can use it to silhouette your subject or create a nice rim light effect. Also look out for low light situations and try to have an external source of light if possible. Hold your shots . Try to hold your shots for at least five seconds, this will make life-in-edit much easier, and don't talk while holding these shots! Don't forget about audio . Poor audio can kill video. Always use an external mic when possible. If you can't, be sure to find a very quiet place to conduct your interviews. Use manual settings as much as possible . Yes, there are a lot of buttons and features on your camera. Learn them and use them! Manual controls are much more reliable and give you total control over your shots, more than any auto features your camera may have. Practice, practice, practice . Like most things in life, the only way to become a better shooter is to practice. The more you shoot, the more comfortable you will become with your camera so you can focus less on camera settings and more on getting those perfect shots.

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- Two Chinese destroyers and a supply ship set sail Friday for the Gulf of Aden on a mission to protect Chinese merchant ships from an increasing number of pirate attacks occurring in the waters off Somalia, state media reported. China has reportedly been working to rapidly modernize its fleet. The Navy fleet left from a port in Sanya city in the southernmost island province of Hainan at 1:50 p.m., according to Xinhua news agency. It marks the first time Chinese naval vessels have left Chinese waters in centuries. They will will join a multinational naval force already patrolling the area, including vessels from the United States, NATO member states, Russia and India. ""This demonstrates that the Chinese government is committed to the international community and a responsible player and a major country in the world,"" Rear Admiral Xiao Xinnian told reporters when the mission was announced last week. The ships are carrying two helicopters and special operations forces, officials said. Figures from the International Maritime Bureau for the year-to-date show pirates have attacked almost 100 vessels and hijacked nearly 40 off the coast of Somalia. The all-important Gulf of Aden links the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea. Around 20,000 oil tankers, freighters and merchant vessels pass along the crucial shipping route each year. China's move is one of the latest reactions to piracy in the gulf. A top Japanese official said Wednesday that Tokyo was considering sending vessels to join the effort. Meanwhile, German sailors on Thursday foiled an attempt by pirates to hijack an Egyptian cargo ship off the coast of Yemen, the German Defense Ministry said. The German navy frigate Karlsruhe responded to an emergency call from the Wabi Al Arab Thursday morning, sending helicopters to the stricken vessel. When the helicopters arrived, the pirates broke off the attack, the ministry said. A crew member on the Wabi Al Arab was wounded when the pirates attempted to board the vessel. He was flown by helicopter for treatment aboard the Karlsruhe, the ministry said. The German sailors captured the pirates and disarmed them, destroying the weapons, the ministry said. China's navy is considered a ""brown-water fleet"" -- designed to operate almost exclusively along its coast. But the country has reportedly been working to rapidly modernize its navy for the past several years. Chinese officials have said their mission would last as long as is necessary and in accordance with U.N. Security Council regulations. The U.N. Security Council passed a resolution last week aimed at combating piracy along the Horn of Africa by allowing military forces to chase pirate onto land in cases of ""hot pursuit."" The Security Council resolution, which passed unanimously, expands upon existing counter-piracy tools, including a stipulation that would allow for national and regional military forces to chase pirates onto land -- specifically into Somalia, where many of the pirates have their bases. Among the victims of pirate attacks have been cargo ships, oil tankers and luxury yachts. At least one major company pulled its ships from the Gulf of Aden region this year, meaning cargo bound for Europe had to round the African continent rather than use the Suez Canal.","It's the first time Chinese naval vessels have left Chinese waters in centuries .

"(CNN) -- Former New Zealand cricket star Chris Cairns won a libel action in London Monday against ex-Indian Premier League (IPL) chief Lalit Modi, who had used Twitter to accuse him of match fixing. Modi, the driving force behind the IPL, must play the former Kiwi captain Â£90,000 ($143,500) and his costs of Â£400,000 ($638,000). The figures do not include his own legal bill. Cairns, 41, took Modi to London High Court over an ""unequivocal allegation"" of match fixing on Modi's Twitter blog in January 2010. The allegation was also published on the website Cricinfo, but later withdrawn after a complaint by Cairns. Modi, who was suspended as chairman of the IPL in 2010, refused to apologize, claiming his allegations were true. He took to Twitter again Monday to declare: ""I have seen the judgment. All I want to say at the moment is that we are appealing the judgment."" For Cairns, the ruling came as a ""great relief,"" saying the allegations had undermined his achievements of scoring over 3,000 runs and 200 wickets in Test cricket. ""Today's verdict lifts a dark cloud that has been over me for the past two years,"" he said in a statement. Mr Justice Bean, who heard the case without a jury, said that Modi had ""singularly failed"" to provide any credible evidence that Cairns was involved in match fixing. ""It is obvious that an allegation that a professional cricketer is a match fixer goes to the core attributes of his personality and, if true entirely destroys his reputation for integrity,"" he said in awarding the damages. Cairns captained the Chandigarh Lions in three competitions in the Indian Cricket League (ICL), which was a rival competition to the IPL. Modi's accusations related to the second and third of these competitions in 2008. Meanwhile in Test action Monday, Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene scored an unbeaten 168 to rescue his side against England in Galle. Sri Lanka slumped to 15 for three wickets on the opening day of the series, but Jayawardene saw them to 298 for eight by the close. Cairns' old team are struggling against South Africa in the third Test in Wellington. South African paceman Vernon Philander became the fastest man in 116 years to reach 50 Test wickets as New Zealand avoided the follow-on by just one run. The Kiwis made 275 in their first innings in reply to South Africa's 474-9 declared. South Africa, battling to take of the top spot in the world rankings from England were 75 without loss by the close of the fourth day. .","Chris Cairns wins libel action against former IPL chief Lalit Modi .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli soldiers have so far detained more than 150 Palestinian suspects in the search for three teenagers who Israel says were kidnapped, the military announced Sunday. Among those detained were Hamas leaders and operatives, the military said. ""We are determined to bring them home and bring the perpetrators of their abduction to justice,"" said Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces. ""People have just dropped off the face of the earth and the three boys, who are our main concern, are the focus of our efforts,"" Lerner told CNN. ""Hamas are behind that, and we are doing everything we can to shake them up as soon as possible in order to bring the boys home."" The teens went missing in Jewish settlements in the West Bank late last week. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke Monday with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and told him to ""assist in returning the abducted youths and in apprehending the kidnappers,"" according to Netanyahu's office. He blamed Hamas for the kidnapping. ""Those who perpetrated the abduction of our youths were members of Hamas -- the same Hamas that Abu Mazen made a unity government with,"" he said Sunday. Abu Mazen is another name for Abbas, whose government now includes Hamas, which controls Gaza. ""The consequences of the partnership with Hamas must be understood: It is bad for Israel, bad for the Palestinians and bad for the region,"" Netanyahu said. Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that in a statement released by his office, Abbas condemned the kidnappings and called on all sides to refrain from violence. One of the three boys is a dual Israeli-American citizen, according to CNN affiliate Channel 10 Israel, which attributed the information to a source at Netanyahu's office. Israeli and U.S. officials have not publicly confirmed the report. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Sunday for the immediate release of the boys. ""We are still seeking details on the parties responsible for this despicable terrorist act, although many indications point to Hamas' involvement,"" Kerry said in a written statement that offered support to the Israeli government. ""As we gather this information, we reiterate our position that Hamas is a terrorist organization known for its attacks on innocent civilians and which has used kidnapping in the past."" Netanyahu: Israeli forces can use 'all measures' to free teens . 'We'll hug them soon' Gilad Shaar, 16; Naftali Frenkel, 16; and Eyal Yifrach, 19, have been missing since late Thursday or Friday and were last seen around Gush Etzion, according to the IDF. The three ""were just on their way home,"" Naftali's mother, Racheli Frankel, told reporters Sunday. ""We trust"" that they ""will be with us here, and we'll hug them soon ... and God willing, we'll all be able to celebrate their return safely,"" she said. She thanked the security forces for their efforts and the U.S. Embassy for its support. ""We feel waves and waves of prayers and support and positive energy in this direction."" Netanyahu has given security forces the OK to use ""all measures"" at their disposal to find the teenagers. The Palestinian Ministry of Information said in a written statement that the arrests come under ""flimsy pretexts"" as a ""continuation of the aggression"" on Palestinians. ""The ministry also asserts that the Israeli military campaign has been on going for decades, during which (Israel) kidnapped the entire Palestinian people,"" it said. Hamas responds . A Hamas spokesman in Gaza told CNN that Netanyahu's comments attributing blame were ""stupid and baseless."" ""The arrest campaign made by the Israeli occupation in the West Bank is targeted to break the backbone of Hamas and bring it down, but the Israelis will not succeed in achieving their goal,"" Sami Abu Zuhri said. But Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon said the kidnappings are a reminder of Hamas' tactics. ""When the Fatah-Hamas government was formed last month, the international community quickly recognized and welcomed it,"" he wrote in a Facebook post. ""Suddenly, Hamas' cruel acts of terrorism were forgotten, their never-ending attempts to harm innocent civilians, along with the Hamas Charter, which calls for the total destruction of the state of Israel."" Now, he wrote, ""the international community has been given a second chance to correct its moral, diplomatic and strategic mistakes. Wall to wall condemnations of the kidnapping are called for, as well as placing responsibility on the Palestinian government, including the threat of taking physical, economic and diplomatic steps against it."" But, he wrote, the international community is ""keeping silent, and by doing so, not only are the Palestinians receiving a false, lenient message, but Israel also understands again that she has no one to count on but herself, something that will not encourage further compromises on her part in the near future."" '#BringBackOurBoys' The abduction of the three teens inspired social media users to use the hashtag #BringBackOurBoys, a reference to the #BringBackOurGirls campaign for more than 200 Nigerian school girls who were kidnapped by militants. The thread quickly became contentious, with pro-Palestinian users alleging many Palestinian children have been kidnapped by Israeli soldiers and imprisoned. A ""Bring Back Our Boys"" Facebook page calling for an end to ""the terrorism against Israel"" had more than 50,000 likes Sunday. CNN's Ben Wedeman, Steve Almasy, Josh Levs and Deborah Doft contributed to this report .","Affiliate: One of three boys is a dual Israeli-American citizen .

"(CNN) -- Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling has sent a letter to the National Basketball Association telling the league he won't pay his $2.5 million fine and rejecting his lifetime ban, a source close to the situation said Friday. The letter also threatens the NBA with a lawsuit if Sterling's punishment for making racist remarks, handed down by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver in April, is not rescinded, the source said. ""We reject your demand for payment,"" the letter says, according to Sports Illustrated. In an exclusive interview with CNN's ""AC 360"" this week, Sterling repeatedly denied he is a racist despite remarks made in a private conversation with his friend V. Stiviano that were released online. In the recording, which drew widespread condemnation from fans, players and the league after it appeared on TMZ, Sterling chastises Stiviano for posting pictures online of her posing with African-Americans, including NBA legend Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson. He tells her not to bring Johnson to Clippers games. ""Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don't put (Magic) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me,"" he said. ""In your lousy f**ing Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people,"" he said during a different portion of the recording. Sterling said he was baited into saying those remarks. Silver and the league moved quickly, announcing the punishment three days after the recordings were released. ""I'm apologizing, and I'm asking for forgiveness,"" Sterling told Cooper. ""Am I entitled to one mistake? After 35 years. I mean, I love my league, I love my partners. ... It's a terrible mistake, and I'll never do it again."" The league's 29 other owners have taken the initial steps to force Sterling to sell the franchise he has owned for 33 years, with an advisory committee meeting three times so far. Sterling's estranged wife, Shelly, has said she wants to keep her 50% ownership in the team, which is through a family trust. The NBA last week tapped Dick Parsons, a former chairman of Citigroup and Time Warner, to be the team's interim chief executive. Sterling has hired Maxwell Blecher, an antitrust lawyer, to represent him with the NBA, Sports Illustrated and USA Today reported. Blecher represented the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in its lawsuit victory against the NFL that allowed the Raiders to move to the city from Oakland without approval from other owners before the 1982 season. The Raiders returned in 1995. According to a 1982 Washington Post article, Blecher also represented Sterling when the Clippers owner wanted to move the team from San Diego to Los Angeles. The NBA fined the franchise $25 million when he did so in 1984, but Sterling sued until the league reduced the fine, according to multiple media reports. CNN reached out to Blecher and the NBA on Thursday night but didn't hear back immediately. Blecher reportedly argued that Sterling was being denied due process rights and he hadn't violated the NBA constitution. The Clippers' turbulent season ended late Thursday in a 104-98 loss to Oklahoma City. The Thunder won the series four games to two. At a post-game news conference, Clippers coach Doc Rivers said he didn't think the team could use the controversy surrounding their owner as an excuse for bowing out of the playoffs. ""Obviously, it's nothing that anybody wants to go through -- nothing I want to go through -- but overall, I thought our fan base, I thought the city, and I thought our guys really hung in there ... very proud of them,"" Rivers said. ""None of us signed on for this, but this is what happened."" Clippers point guard Chris Paul was in no mood about Sterling after the game. ""That's the least of our worries right now is him. We just lost the damn series,"" he said. ""That's the last thing on our mind. We gave him too much attention as it is.""","Source: Sterling says he'll sue NBA if he's punished .

"(CNN) -- The Maldives overturned a six-decade-old moratorium on capital punishment with the adoption of a new regulation this week that allows for the death penalty to be used to punish certain crimes. The Maldivian government enacted the regulation, which makes provision for execution by lethal injection, for the crimes of premeditated murder or deliberate manslaughter. While the age of criminal responsibility is 10 in the Maldives, some crimes under the country's Sharia laws -- known as Hadd offenses -- have an age of responsibility of 7. This means that juveniles could potentially face execution in the archipelago. Execution facilities at the Maldives' Maafushi Prison were being built to carry out sentences. Since reenacted, 20 people have been sentenced to death, although one of these sentences was overturned by the High Court, a report in the country's Haveeru newspaper said. Local Maldives media reported that Minister of Home Affairs Umar Naseer defended the decision to reinstate the penalty, saying that the Maldives was suffering from overcrowded prisons and a ""lively criminal environment."" He was also quoted as saying that the Maldives was ""a hundred percent Islamic country and there are certain values that we all believe in."" The U.N. and EU have expressed their concerns about the move, which could potentially see minors killed by the state. ""According to the new regulation, minors convicted of intentional murder shall be executed once they turn 18. Similar provisions in the recently ratified Penal Code, allowing for the application of the death penalty for crimes committed when below the age of 18, are also deeply regrettable,"" Ravina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a statement. ""We urge the Government to retain its moratorium on the use of the death penalty in all circumstances, particularly in cases that involve juvenile offenders and to work towards abolishing the practice altogether."" EU High Representative Catherine Ashton was also ""deeply concerned"" about the adoption of the regulations and urged the Maldives to retain the moratorium on the death penalty. ""The High Representative holds a strong and principled position against the death penalty,"" a statement issued by her office said. ""The death penalty is cruel and inhumane, and has not been shown in any way to act as a deterrent to crime.""

"(CNN) -- ""The Bachelorette"" premiered Monday night with a tribute to a contestant. Eric Hill, 31, died in April from injuries suffered in a paragliding accident after filming the show. He was one of 25 men vying for the heart of ""Bachelorette"" Andi Dorfman, 26. At the beginning of Monday's show, host Chris Harrison offered some kind words about Hill, who was an adventurer who documented his goal of visiting every country in 1,200 days on his website, The Global Odyssey. ""Eric passed away shortly after concluding his filming on this show,"" Harrison said. ""In the coming weeks, you'll see that Eric was a vibrant man. Every day, he impressed us with his passion and courageous spirit. He will be greatly missed. And we dedicate this season to him."" The premiere kicked off Season 10 of the series. During the show, Hill gifted Dorfman with dolls from Peru -- the first country he had visited outside of the North American continent. Dorfman thanked him and later selected him as one of the bachelors to whom she granted one-on-one time. Harrison, who in addition to hosting the show also serves as one of the producers, talked to Salon about the difficulty in dealing with Hill's death on the reality show. ""One of the contestants who left the show died in a tragic accident,"" Harrison said. ""And he was a wonderful man, and very much beloved on the show, a central figure early on before he left, and our decision was quickly made: We have to show what he went through. And also because it affected our cast and our crew, what we went through. So to just cut that out of the show wouldn't have done justice to anybody, even him.""","Eric Hill died after finishing filming ""The Bachelorette""

"(CNN) -- Filippo Inzaghi has scored some big goals in his time -- but his next goal may prove the most important and arguably the toughest. One of AC Milan's most revered strikers has been given the opportunity to revitalize the ailing Serie A giant after being handed a two-year deal to become the club's new coach. Inzaghi's joy is his former teammate Clarence Seedorf's misery with the Dutchman dismissed after Milan finished eighth last season, ruling the club out of European football for the first time in 16 years. Inzaghi has long been linked with the job following his impressive work with the club's youth team. ""AC Milan wishes to communicate that coach Clarence Seedorf has been sacked, and the first team has been entrusted to Pippo Inzaghi until June 30, 2016,"" said a Milan statement. Seedorf only arrived in January after replacing Massimiliano Allegri, but was unable to resuscitate Milan's flickering European hopes. Since retiring in 2012, Inzaghi has worked with the club's Under-19 side and achieved success by winning the Torneo di Viareggio trophy for the first time in 10 years. He holds legendary status at Milan following his goalscoring exploits -- 126 goals in 300 appearances. He remains the club's most successful striker in European competition with 43 goals to his name, 70 in total following his time with Juventus . Former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson once joked that Inzaghi ""must have been born offside,"" testament to the Italian's predatory instincts in front of goal. After arriving at Milan in 2001 following a move from Turin, Inzaghi won the 2003 Champions League and helped the Rossoneri repeat the triumph four years later by scoring both goals in the 2-1 win over Liverpool. He started his playing career at Piacenza before going on to win two Serie A titles with Milan in 2004 and 2011 to add to his success with Juventus in 1998. Inzaghi, who scored 25 goals in 57 appearances for Italy, retired in 2012, netting the winner on his final club appearance against Novara. Beaten in the second round of the European Champions League by Atletico Madrid last season, Milan has already begun preparations for next season, signing Paris Saint-Germain defender Alex last week on a two-year deal.","AC Milan appoints Filippo Inzaghi as its new manager .

"(CNN) -- Many have matched his size, some his speed, but no-one ever combined the two to such devastating effect on a rugby field as Jonah Lomu. The former All Blacks winger became the sport's first global superstar when he burst onto the international scene at the 1995 Rugby World Cup and now, almost two decades on, his appeal shows no sign of slowing down. In his capacity as ambassador for the recent HSBC Sevens World Series tournament in Wellington, Lomu was given a hero's welcome at the New Zealand capital's Westpac Stadium. It's a reception he's got used to wherever he goes, but the cries are particularly heartfelt at a ground where he represented both the provincial side Wellington and the Hurricanes in Super 12 from 2000-2003. ""The greatest thing I love about sevens is the camaraderie that the players have among all the nations. But at the same time the fans make what sevens is all about,"" Lomu tells CNN's Rugby Sevens Worldwide show. ""It's exactly how the game should be played -- fair play but at the same time speed, skill, pace: everything that needs to be done,"" he adds. ""You see it in the crowd as well -- they need a bit of stamina (too) because it's two days of partying hard. There's a lot of celebrating going on but it's absolutely beautiful to be a player on the pitch or a former player in the stands watching your favorite team."" Lomu's international career began at the Hong Kong Sevens in 1994 before gaining his first full cap against France later that year to become the youngest player (19 years, 45 days) to wear the prestigious All Blacks jersey since the start of that century. ""When I chucked on my All Black shirt, for me, it was like armor, getting ready to go into battle,"" he says. ""When you get the opportunity to pull it on it is absolutely something special."" The following year his enormous frame -- 1.96 meters (6 foot 5 inches) tall, weighing 260 pounds (117 kg) -- made a global impact at the World Cup in South Africa. Lomu famously trampled all over England's pride (and Mike Catt's body) in the semifinals, running in four tries -- inducing insult then praise from Will Carling after the game. ""He's a freak and the sooner he goes away the better,"" the shell-shocked England captain said following his team's 45-29 defeat. ""He's very balanced, has that incredible power and anyone coming on to the ball like he did is almost impossible to stop. He's an amazing athlete."" Rugby's current fastest player, American Carlin Isles, who reportedly runs the 100 meters in 10.13 seconds, says speeding down the wing feels like flying. But from Lomu -- who has a best of 10.80 seconds over the same distance -- comes a more earthy assessment. ""I don't know what other people are thinking of when they're running down the sidelines, but all I think about is there is one destination that I need to get to and that's the try line,"" Lomu says. ""Whoever or whatever is in front of me, I either go around it or over it, or if not create something for my teammates."" From 1994-2002, Lomu ran in a total of 37 tries in 63 appearances for New Zealand in an international career interrupted and eventually prematurely curtailed by a life-threatening kidney condition. The 38-year-old has suffered from nephrotic syndrome, a rare kidney disorder, since 1995. He nearly died in 2011 when a transplanted organ received in 2004 started to fail. ""My bloodstream was septic and the doctors were starting to think the worst: that my kidney had failed and my body was in total meltdown,"" Lomu, who on the waiting list for a new transplant, revealed last year. He has been able to deal with his health problems by drawing on his experiences on the rugby field. ""The reason why I think I can cope with my medical condition (is because of) the things that I've learned through rugby -- the desires and beliefs that I was given through playing the game,"" Lomu says. ""It's helped me get through all the adversity that I've gone through and at the same time prepared me for life. That's the one thing that rugby has -- it gives you opportunities but at the same time gives you the belief that you can get through anything."" Lomu still requires regular dialysis but isn't one to complain, preferring to focus on the positives. ""Medically, I'm as good as I can be. Traveling around the world is always difficult because of the medical treatment that I need, but I've got a great wife (Nadene) who organizes it all. The family that I have gives me the will to get up in the morning ... especially my two boys (Brayley and Dhyreille) -- that's always a reason to get up."" Another incentive has been promoting sevens in Wellington and around the world as the the abbreviated version of rugby union gears up for its Olympic debut at Rio in 2016. ""When you're talking about the changing dimensions of the game, sevens is where it's at,"" he says. ""The nations that couldn't match the bigger nations at the 15-man game, they can definitely do this and get in there and compete with the best nations ... or even knock them over, as the Kenyan team has shown us."" Kenya -- a relative rugby backwater -- shocked the rugby world by beating New Zealand in the semifinals at last year's Wellington Sevens. This time around, the east Africans didn't fair so well, but still managed a notable win over Scotland, the sport's inventors back in 1883, in the final of the Bowl competition last month. ""The biggest thing for sevens is making sure it grows in the way it should grow and people keep enjoying it,"" Lomu says. ""But the beauty is that it can only get better. ""When you've got 142 countries playing the game, that's awesome to see. And this is the next level."" Read more: Rugby sevens' sister act .

"Sana'a, Yemen (CNN) -- Yemeni forces have killed Said al-Shihri, second in command of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Yemeni Defense Ministry said Monday. A Yemeni government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said officials are waiting for DNA confirmation. If confirmed, the death ""would be a deeply significant blow against AQAP,"" CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said. Security Clearance: Dead, captured and wanted . The killing of al-Shihri and other AQAP leaders ""is leading to the gradual dismantlement of the group,"" CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen said. White House counterterrorism adviser John Brennan in April described AQAP as ""very, very dangerous"" and ""the most active operational franchise"" of al Qaeda. FBI Director Robert Mueller told Congress in May that al Qaeda and its affiliates, ""especially al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, currently represent the top counterterrorism threat to the nation."" The group was behind the so-called underwear bomb attempt on a U.S.-bound international flight on Christmas Day 2009 and an effort to smuggle bombs in printer cartridges onto U.S.-bound cargo planes in 2010. Al-Shihri, who was once held by the United States at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, was killed Monday in an operation in Hadramawt Valley, state-run news agency SABA reported. Six other terrorists were killed as well, the military said in its statement, posted on an official website. One security official said that a brother of senior AQAP leader Nadir al-Shadadi was among those killed. While the Yemeni military said al-Shihri was killed in ""an operation by the armed forces,"" three local security officials told CNN that a U.S. drone conducted the strike. The United States generally does not comment on reported drone strikes. ""For weeks we have known his destination and were waiting for the right time to conduct this major operation. The attack makes al Qaeda a handicapped network,"" a senior Defense Ministry official told CNN on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk to media. Officials: Al Qaeda affiliate surrounded at last Yemen stronghold . In November 2007, al-Shihri, a Saudi national, was transferred from Guantanamo Bay to Saudi custody to undergo a program designed to lead people away from terrorism. Despite travel restrictions requiring him to stay in Saudi Arabia, he left for Yemen, where he joined another former Guantanamo detainee to assume leadership of AQAP, the U.S. House Armed Services Committee said in a document about detainees who resume terrorism. The U.S. State Department notes that he was publicly identified in January 2009 as the deputy leader of AQAP. ""As deputy of AQAP, al-Shihri helps carry out terrorist acts by generating targets, recruiting new members, assisting with training and attack planning, and tasking others in the preparation of attacks,"" the State Department said. He is believed to have played a key operational role within AQAP, including the planning of attacks inside Yemen and a failed attack to the kill the head of Saudi counterterrorism in 2009, Cruickshank said. Al-Shihri ""was the most important Saudi figure within the group. He was key to AQAP's recruitment of Saudis and their fund-raising in the kingdom,"" Cruickshank said. In December 2009, Yemen said it thought al-Shihri was at the site of an aerial assault against senior al Qaeda operatives. But later reports said he had apparently escaped the attack. Officials: 5 suspected al Qaeda killed in Yemen drone strike . Residents in the Hadramawt Valley said that Yemeni Air Force planes and U.S. drones have been roaming the skies for four days. On Sunday, Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi said Yemeni authorities had uncovered three al Qaeda plots to attack populous areas in the provinces of Sana'a, Aden and Hadramawt. Meanwhile, clashes intensified Monday between al Qaeda and the pro-government Popular Resistance Committees in the town of Shaqra, the third day of fighting. Three al Qaeda militants were killed in the clashes, two local security officials said. ""Al Qaeda is attempting to retake the areas it lost in May. It is sending its fighters back to Abyan,"" one of the security officials told CNN on condition of anonymity because of sensitivity of the issue. After the Yemeni government announced victory against AQAP in the towns of Jaar, Zinjibar and Shaqra in late May, the terrorist group carried out numerous suicide bombings in various provinces, killing hundreds of troops. One of the bombings killed the commander of Yemen's southern military region, Salem Qatan, the highest-ranking military official killed in Yemen's fight against terrorism. Al Qaeda diminished, but not gone . Journalist Hakim Almasmari reported from Sana'a; CNN's Josh Levs reported from Atlanta. CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom and Tim Lister contributed to this report.","NEW: If confirmed, the death ""would be a deeply significant blow,"" a CNN analyst says .

"(CNN) -- American teenagers rank below average when it comes to understanding the value of money -- while Chinese kids are the best. In a quiz designed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to reveal ""financial literacy"" of 15-year-olds, students from the U.S., Russia and Latvia emerged as below middling. Teens from China, Belgium, Estonia, Australia and New Zealand were revealed as the savviest. Nearly 30,000 students across 18 of the world's industrialized nations were tested on how they understood financial matters for the report. The 15-year olds were given range of tasks -- from figuring out an invoice and payslip to making a judgment on value of money. Do you think consider yourself money smart? Then try answering the three questions below, taken from the OECD test. Answers are at the bottom of the story. 1. You can buy tomatoes by the kilogram or by the box. Bought loose, they are $2.75 per kilogram, while a 10 kilogram box is $22. The box of tomatoes is better value for money than the loose tomatoes. Why? 2: Mrs Jones has a loan of $8,000 with FirstZed Finance. The annual interest rate on the loan is 15%. Her repayments each month are $150. After one year Mrs Jones still owes $7,400. Another finance company called Zedbest will give Mrs Jones a loan of $10,000 with an annual interest rate of 13%. Her repayments each month would also be $150. If she takes the Zedbest loan, Mrs Jones will immediately pay off her existing loan. What are two other financial benefits for Mrs Jones if she takes the Zedbest loan? What is one possible negative financial consequence for Mrs Jones if she agrees to the Zedbest loan? 3: Each month, Jane's salary is paid into her bank account. This is Jane's pay slip for July: . EMPLOYEE PAY SLIP: Jane Citizen - 1 July to 31 July . Position: Manager . Gross salary $2,800 . Deductions $300 . Net salary $2,500 . Gross salary to date this year $19,600 . How much money did Jane's employer pay into her bank account on 31 July? A. $300 . B. $2,500 . C. $2,800 . D. $19,600 . Answers: . 1. The price per kilogram of boxed tomatoes is less than the price per kilogram for loose tomatoes -- $2.20 per kg for the boxed tomatoes compared to $2.75 per kg for the loose tomatoes. 2. Mrs Jones will have extra money to use and will get a lower interest rate. But she will also owe more money overall, will pay more interest in total and will take longer to repay her debt. 3: B .

"(CNN) -- Australian Open champion Li Na bowed meekly out of Wimbledon Friday to extend her miserable record at the grass court grand slam, blaming her lack of preparation for a shock defeat. The Chinese second seed was beaten 7-6 7-6 by Barbora Zahlavova Strycova of the Czech Republic, ranked 43 in the world, who was reaching the last 16 of a grand slam for the first time in 32 attempts. Trailing 6-5 in the second set tiebreaker, Li successfully challenged after her forehand was called long. But given a second chance of redemption on a replayed match point, Li served her seventh double fault to exit in lame fashion. The 32-year-old Li has never gone beyond the last 32 in eight appearances at the All England Club and also went out in the first round of the French Open last month. It's a far cry from her triumph in Melbourne back in January when she beat Dominika Cibulkova in the final of the opening grand slam of season, her second triumph in one of tennis' four majors. After her defeat, Li told reporters that she had made an error of judgment in skipping the warmup event at Eastbourne. ""I think I needed some matches before the big one, I think I made the wrong decision,"" she said. For the 28-year-old Zahlavova Strycova, it was her biggest win of a mediocre career on the WTA Tour, interrupted by a six-month ban for a doping offense in 2013. ""I am very happy. I played a great match and I believed I could do it. It's my biggest win,"" she said. Former world number one Caroline Wozniacki awaits the Czech in the next round, the Dane beating Croatian teenager Ana Konjuh 6-3 6-0 to reach the last 16 of a grand slam for only the third time since 2011. Petra Kvitova later won the battle of former champions on Centre Court after an enthralling two and a half hour battle against Venus Williams. Kvitova, who took the title in 2011, had to come back from a set down to beat the five-time champion from the United States, 5-7 7-6 7-5. Polish fourth seed Agnieszka Radwanska, the runner-up to Venus' younger sister Serena in 2012, also made the last 16 with a 6-2 6-0 win over Portuguese qualifier Michelle Larcher de Brito. Djokovic scare . In the men's tournament, top seed Novak Djokovic took a nasty tumble on the way to a 6-4 6-2 6-4 win over France's Gilles Simon. The 2011 champion made a spectacular diving attempt to reach a Simon shot in the sixth game of the third set and fell awkwardly on his shoulder. The Serbian star needed treatment on the court and had to take a painkiller before rounding out an otherwise routine win. ""Yes it was a sharp pain when I fell. It was an awkward fall. I was just hoping nothing was going on bad with the joint,"" he admitted later to reporters. ""There was no damage in the joint, so I could play a few games after that. The muscle was still quite sore because of the impact, so all in all I'm just glad to get through. ""Now there are two days off so I'm going to recover and get ready."" Djokovic faces a tough last 16 clash against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, but has won 10 of his 11 meetings with the Frenchman, who is seeded 14th this year. Defending champion Andy Murray wasted little time on Centre Court later as he polished off Roberto Bautista Agut of Spain in their third round clash. Third seed Murray won 6-2 6-3 6-2 and will play Kevin Anderson of South Africa for a place in the quarterfinals Monday. But sixth seed Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic went out in a late evening upset, losing in straight sets, 7-6 6-4 7-6 to Marin Cilic of Croatia.","Second seed Li Na crashes out of Wimbledon .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Kenya has finally struck oil after decades of exploration, the country's president announced Monday. President Mwai Kibaki called the discovery a ""major breakthrough,"" though it will take more than three years before the country can become an oil producer. ""This is the first time Kenya has made such a discovery and it is very good news for our country,"" Kibaki said at a state function in Nairobi. British-based Tullow Oil said it established more than 20 meters (65 feet) of net oil pay, which refers to the depth of the oil reservoir. ""This is an excellent start to our major exploration campaign in the East African rift basins of Kenya and Ethiopia,"" the company's exploration director, Angus McCoss, said in a written statement. ""To make a good oil discovery in our first well is beyond our expectations and bodes well for the material program ahead of us."" Read more: Ghana's oil discovery: blessing or curse? The company said it plans to drill deeper and drill multiple other wells to seek more oil. Tullow said it discovered the oil well in Turkana County, in the northwestern part of the country near Uganda, where the company is already a major player in the country's oil fields. Kenya is the second country, after Uganda, to have discovered oil in East Africa. Richard Leakey, a noted paleontologist and environmentalist, told CNN there could be significant benefits from the oil find. ""I have always thought there was oil there and I have encouraged the search for oil for the past 40 years because of our geological surveys,"" said Leakey, who has been working in the Turkana region for four decades. ""In the end, I believe there will be a significant find."" See also: Concerns over South Africa fracking plans . Leakey says will take five to 10 years for the oil find to benefit Kenyans. ""The hope is that Kenya won't squander the money before it has made anything,"" he said. Kenya must now safeguard against oil spills and environmental pollution, he said, and make sure local people benefit. Tullow has more than 90 production and exploration licenses in 22 countries in Africa, Europe, South America and Asia. National Oil Corp. of Kenya has been directing the search of oil in the country since its began operating in 1984, according to its website.","Kenya's president calls it a 'major breakthrough'

"(CNN) -- For one of the farthest, coldest places in the solar system, Pluto sure stirs a lot of hot emotions right here on Earth. This montage of images taken by Voyager shows, from left to right, Neptune, Uranus, Saturn and Jupiter. It was three years ago Monday that the International Astronomical Union demoted Pluto from a planet to a dwarf planet, a decision that made jaws drop around the world. An outcry followed, textbooks had to be rewritten, long-held beliefs were shattered, and many people felt our cosmic neighborhood just didn't seem the same with eight -- instead of nine --planets in the solar system. Today, debate still rages over how to classify the little celestial body, along with others orbiting the sun, but the IAU stands by its definition. ""I think that most of the astronomical community has come to terms with the fact that we now know that the solar system has a continuous distribution of objects from very large down to very small,"" said Lars Lindberg Christensen, a spokesman for the IAU. ""We now know that what we call the different objects has to necessarily change with time."" Don't tell that to Plutophiles still seething about the decision. Some are even taking action. Earlier this year, the Illinois Senate adopted a resolution declaring that Pluto was ""unfairly downgraded"" and restoring ""full planetary status"" to the celestial body as it ""passes overhead through Illinois' night skies."" It also designated March 13, 2009, as ""Pluto Day"" in honor of the date that its discovery was announced in 1930. (In case you are wondering why the state is so passionate about Pluto: Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered the planet-now-dwarf-planet, was born in Illinois.) Meanwhile, New Mexico's House of Representatives proclaimed February 18, 2009, as ""Pluto is a Planet in New Mexico Day"" and praised Tombaugh, who worked in the state for decades and died there in 1997. Passionate about Pluto . Don't live in those states and want to make your voice heard? You can order ""Plutophile"" bumper stickers to proclaim your firm support for Pluto, print out a Pluto Fan Club card -- which allows you to declare, ""In my heart, Pluto will always be a planet"" -- or sign an online petition. Christensen said 90 percent of the critical e-mails and letters the IAU received after its decision in 2006 came from North America. Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of New York City's Hayden Planetarium and author of ""The Pluto Files,"" believes there are two reasons why Americans are so engaged in the issue. ""Disney's dog Pluto was sketched the same year the cosmic object was discovered. And Pluto was discovered by an American. So here you have a recipe for Americans falling in love with a planet that really is just a tiny ice ball,"" Tyson told Time magazine. Still, astronomers are divided about the best way to classify Pluto.  See photos of other planets and find out what makes them stand out » . At the heart of the matter lies the question: What makes a planet in the solar system? According to the IAU's definition, it must orbit the sun, it must be big enough for gravity to crush it into a nearly round shape, and it must clear the neighborhood around its orbit. In other words, it must be dominant enough to clear away objects in its orbital space, according to NASA. This last point is what proved to be Pluto's demise as a planet: There are other competing objects in its orbit. Crowded solar system? Some scientists say that part of the definition doesn't make sense. ""It's kind of like, I'm going to tell you what your car is on the basis of how the traffic around you is behaving,"" said Mark Sykes, director of the Planetary Science Institute. The more logical way to classify planets is the geophysical definition, which simply states that planets are round objects that orbit the sun, Sykes argues. The objects must still be big enough so that gravity crushes them into a ball. ""The problem with the geophysical definition is we might have a couple of dozen planets in the solar system as more are discovered in the distant reaches,"" Sykes said. He believes the International Astronomical Union's definition won't stick around after NASA spacecraft reach Pluto and Ceres, a Texas-size asteroid in an orbit between Mars and Jupiter that is now also classified as a dwarf planet. ""I think [the IAU's definition] is going to collapse by 2015 when the Dawn mission gets to Ceres and the New Horizons mission gets to Pluto because we're not going to see irregular-shaped, impact crater-filled, boring surfaces. We're going to see dynamic worlds,"" Sykes said. The IAU's decision also came under fire because only 4 percent of its scientists participated in the vote that reclassified Pluto. But Christensen said the IAU was following its statutes and bylaws and has passed other resolutions in a similar way. The subject of Pluto didn't come up at the IAU's general assembly earlier this month in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Christensen added. Sykes countered that astronomers wanted to discuss the issue, just as they have at other recent major meetings, but the IAU didn't allow there to be any sessions on planet classification. ""I think the IAU did a terrible disservice to science, because it gives the public the impression that science is done by votes,"" Sykes said. ""And that's not the way science is done at all.""","International Astronomical Union demoted Pluto to a dwarf planet three years ago .

"Lalibela, Ethiopia (CNN) -- It's 4 o'clock on a Sunday morning when a trail of figures dressed in white emerges from the deep darkness. Quietly, the summoned crowd makes its way down a cluster of ancient structures as the slow beat from traditional skin drums beckons. It's a common scene here in Lalibela, a small town in northern Ethiopia that's home to 11 spectacular churches carved both inside and out from a single rock some 900 years ago. The chiseled creations have turned this mountain town into a place of pride and pilgrimage for worshipers of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, attracting 80,000 to 100,000 visitors every year. ""It is one of the very important places for the Ethiopian Orthodox Church people,"" says local guide Fikru Woldegiorgis, who's lived here most of his life. ""There is a belief that Lalibela pilgrims share the same blessing as pilgrims to Jerusalem,"" he explains. ""They have to come at least once in a lifetime."" And they come from all over. Even though Lalibela sits in a remote region of Ethiopia, the faithful will walk for days, even weeks, to get here, many of them traversing the rugged mountains barefoot. Amongst them, blind men and women and people with disabilities also join the pilgrimage, making their way along Lalibela's winding, hilly roads to reach the sacred site. ""What makes the Lalibela churches important is that they are still in use,"" says Woldegiorgis. ""It's not a museum; it's a living heritage. Every day, every morning, there is a service in all the churches."" Brimming with spirituality . Ethiopia is home to one of the oldest Christian churches in the world, dating back to the early fourth century. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church used to be a part of Egypt's Coptic Church, but established its own patriarch in 1959. Today, nearly two thirds of the East African country's population is Christian, with most belonging to the Orthodox Church. Read this: Will African coins rewrite Australian history? Nowhere does the spirituality of the church's followers echo louder than in Lalibela. The town is brimming with devotion; throughout the churches' compound, you'll find worshipers leaning against the structures, kissing the age-old rock walls, praying quietly or reading religious texts. ""They come early to get the blessing -- because it's such a big deal, every inch of the place is packed,"" says Aba Gebreyesus, the priest who presides over all the churches in Lalibela. ""People are so happy with the blessings they get here, they come here without any prompting and spend their nights and days at the church."" Distinctive monuments . The medieval structures were commissioned by King Lalibela, of the Zagwe Dynasty, which ruled much of the country back in the 12th century. There are several stories surrounding the creation of the churches, one of which says that humans worked during the day and angels would speed up the building overnight. Some historians say construction was completed at a remarkable pace, taking about 23 years. Watch this: Why do Rastafarians love Ethiopia? Carved out of volcanic tuff rock, the famous churches have been built in a variety of styles. Some of them were chiseled into the face of the rock, where others stand as isolated blocks, like the iconic church of Saint George, constructed in the shape of the cross. A complex and extensive system of drainage ditches, tunnels and subterranean passageways connects the underground structures. Alebachev Retta, an 86-year-old church scholar who has studied in some of Ethiopia's holiest cities, explains what makes these churches so distinctive. ""They are different because they were built from the top down,"" he says. ""Everywhere in the world, structures are built from the ground up,"" he adds. ""There is nothing comparable in the world."" Living legacy . Thanks to their impressive architecture and rich influence on Ethiopian Christianity, the churches have been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1978. Five years ago, UNESCO decided to erect protective coverings to shield four of the churches from the elements. The shelters may be unsightly, but experts say they are critical to preserving the integrity of the churches. In recent years, a conscious effort to develop Lalibela's infrastructure has also brought further attention to this remote place, leading to the arrival of even more pilgrims and tourists. Retta says he's seen positive changes in Lalibela over the years. He says he's especially content with how it's become a worldwide tourist destination. ""One, because the country's culture should be shown, and secondly, many poor people in the area are being helped,"" he says. ""Everyone is making a living through the tourism business. It's great; without the tourists, there is no salary for anyone. If the tourists stopped, everything will stop."" But that doesn't seem likely, as visitors keep on coming to Lalibela's churches. And although the sacred sites provide a solid foundation for the faithful, it's the followers themselves that ultimately breathe life into these ancient rock walls.","Small town of Lalibela is a religious and pilgrimage center in Ethiopia .

"(CNN) -- Martin Kaymer drained a crucial birdie putt on the 18th green Saturday to hold a commanding five-shot lead going into the final round of the U.S. Open in North Carolina. It gave Kaymer a battling third round of two-over 72 for eight-under 202 as the German seeks his second major title. American pair Rickie Fowler and Erik Compton both shot best of the day three-under-par 67s to take closer order to the runaway leader. Nobody else bettered par with testing pin positions set by officials. 2010 PGA Championship winner Kaymer had started the third round with a six stroke lead after reaching halfway with a record 10-under total of 130 at Pinehurst No.2. Behind Fowler and Compton it was Swede Henrik Stenson and Dustin Johnson, who both carded level-par 70s, to stand two-under 208 and maintain slim hopes of lifting the trophy. Kaymer, bidding to become the first man to win the Players Championship and the U.S. Open in the same year, recovered from two early bogeys by eagling the par-5 fifth hole. But missing fairways, he made three bogeys to come back toward the pack until holing from eight foot on the last for a morale-boosting birdie. ""It was good. I didn't play as well as the first two days, but I kept it together,"" Kaymer told the PGA Tour website. ""The USGA put the pins in very, very difficult positions."" Behind the leaders, Phil Mickelson's hopes of completing a career grand slam ended with a two-over 72 for five over. ""If I hit it better and make some putts, I think I can shoot four or five under par, end around even, finish second again,"" he joked in a reference to his six runner-up spots in the only major to elude him. Defending champion Justin Rose of England moved into a tie for 10th, with rising star Jordan Spieth also on that mark, after a fine level-par 70 for one-over 211, but still nine shots behind Kaymer.","Martin Kaymer holds on to lead at U.S. Open .

"Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN) -- Sean Cononie bounded out of the back of an ambulance ahead of most of the other volunteers. A bullhorn in his hand, he was, in a sense, the pied piper. ""If there's anybody out here, that wants the swine flu vaccine, please come over here,"" he said. And come they did. Outside Fort Lauderdale's main library, a crowd started to build, and soon about a dozen homeless people were rolling up their shirt sleeves -- in the middle of the street -- for the H1N1 vaccination. ""You stop spreading the germs,"" Cononie said. ""Because if a homeless person gets positive for the swine flu, they get sick, they go into a gas station and use the bathroom, transfer those germs to a public bathroom, [then] mom and dad come in with little ones, use that bathroom -- boom. Bingo. Contagious. Swine flu."" The volunteers are with the Homeless Voice -- a nonprofit homeless advocacy center that also runs a shelter in Hollywood, Florida. They've hit the streets for about three weeks to vaccinate the homeless population in Broward County. They requested the vaccine through the Florida Department of Health to help part of a population that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls an at risk group. Many homeless people often have untreated medical conditions, and the lack of sanitary conditions makes it easier for them to catch the virus. So far, the group has vaccinated about 300 homeless people . ""Some have high blood pressure, some are alcoholics and are more susceptible to the flu, the seasonal flu, and the swine flu,"" said Dr. Chad Frank, a family practice physician who is a volunteer. ""We're protecting them, and we're also saving the emergency rooms here as well from being overloaded with potential patients, swine flu patients."" Wearing a yellow reflective T-shirt, Frank spends his nights on the street during the vaccination effort. ""I think it's needed,"" he said. ""And believe it or not, it's fun. That's why I'm a doctor."" Russell Ahamed was one of the first people in line. He lives in the park next to the library in downtown Fort Lauderdale. The volunteers took his temperature to make sure he wasn't running a fever and took his name down so he could be entered into a Department of Health database. ""I appreciate this. There's not a whole lot of people that come by and do something like this,"" Ahamed said. ""I know people can die from [the flu]."" But on this night, not everyone was able to get the shot. William -- the only name he gave to volunteers -- was ready and willing but not able. Alcohol had gotten the best of him, and he could no longer stand. Fearing a possible bad reaction to the vaccine, the volunteers would not give it to him. Calmly, Cononie leaned down to talk to William, who was sitting on the grass, and explained why they couldn't vaccinate him then. ""William, I'm gonna put something in your bag. It's a piece of paper,"" Cononie said. ""When you wake up in the morning, promise me you're going to look for this piece of paper, OK? It says our phone number. Call us in the morning. We'll come back and give you a shot when you're a little more sober."" William insisted, ""I need the shot now."" Cononie replied, ""Well, we don't think tonight's a good night because you have a lot of alcohol in you."" The volunteers, who travel with a police escort in case they encounter any situation they're not equipped to handle, described the homeless as a forgotten population. Lee Engels is newly homeless. He lost his trailer and his construction job in Martin County, Florida, and headed south to Fort Lauderdale, he said. He's been homeless for three weeks, and he's trying to stay sober. ""It's tough out here, but it's how you make it,"" Engels said, rolling up his sleeve to get the vaccine injection. The volunteers said there's no way to know how much of an effect they are having in stopping the spread of H1N1, but they believe they are doing a public service. ""A true blessing,"" Engels agreed. ""You don't have to go to a hospital and pay the bill.""","Volunteers hit streets to offer H1N1 vaccine to homeless in Broward County, Florida .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Spain has suspended the sale of police riot-control equipment to Venezuela due to instability there, two Spanish government officials said Friday. Weeks of protests against the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro have left more than 30 people dead, more than 500 injured and more than 2,000 people detained, Amnesty International said in a report released this week. Spain's provisional suspension of the riot-control gear sales was quietly agreed to last month by a government commission that includes the ministries of foreign affairs, defense, interior and commerce, said the officials, who declined to be named because they are not authorized to publicly speak about the decision. The suspension was first reported by Spain's El Pais newspaper. Spain authorized the sale of $2.6 million euros ($3.5 million) in riot-control equipment to Venezuela last year, the Economy ministry reported. Spain's inter-ministerial government commission routinely reviews sales of military weapons and other sensitive material like police riot-control equipment, and takes into consideration ""the internal stability of the nation destined"" to receive the equipment, said one of the government officials. The other official said it's not the first time Spain has suspended the sale of riot control gear to Venezuela. It was also done when long-serving Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez -- Maduro's predecessor -- was in power. Among those killed in the protests was a dual Spanish-Venezuelan citizen, Wilder Carballo Amayo, who died last February from a gunshot wound to the head, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said. Spain, like many other nations and international agencies, has urged the Venezuelan government and opposition forces to seek a solution through dialogue. The Venezuelan Embassy in Madrid answered a phone call from CNN but declined to comment immediately on the suspension of sales of crowd control equipment. Amnesty International's president in Spain, Esteban Beltran, told reporters this week, ""In our opinion, if human rights are not placed at the top of the political agenda in Venezuela, then Venezuela risks entering a spiral of violence that would lead to even more human rights abuses and violations.""","30 have died in protests against the government of Venezuela .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge with a secret court has refused the Obama administration's request to extend storage of classified National Security Agency telephone surveillance data beyond the current five-year limit. The Justice Department had argued several pending lawsuits over the bulk data collection program require it to preserve the records for a longer period of time. Judge Reggie Walton, who presides over the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, concluded on Friday the government had not overcome larger privacy concerns. ""The amended procedures would further infringe on the privacy interests of United States persons whose telephone records were acquired in vast numbers and retained by the government to aid in national security investigations,"" said Walton, whose main duties are as a Washington-based federal district court judge. ""The great majority of these individuals have never been the subject of investigations by the FBI to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities. The government seeks to retain these records, not for national security reasons, but because some of them may be relevant in civil litigation in which the destruction of those very same records is being requested. However, the civil plaintiffs potentially interested in preserving the (telecom) metadata have expressed no desire to acquire the records."" Current surveillance court orders require the National Security Agency or telecommunication companies that gathered the phone records to purge the material within five years. ""The government makes no attempt to explain why it believes the records that are subject to destruction are relevant to the civil cases,"" said Walton in his 12-page order. There was no immediate reaction to the order from the Justice Department. Intelligence leaker Edward Snowden last June revealed a secret surveillance court order approving government collection of mass amounts of metadata from telecom giant Verizon. It includes phone numbers called and their location. The exact percentage of metadata being collected has not been revealed publicly. Monitoring of actual conversations requires a separate warrant. President Barack Obama in January cited privacy concerns when announcing that such data should no longer be held by the government, but instead be turned over to the domestic telecoms or a private third party. NSA would still have access to the calls to track potential terror connections. He ordered the intelligence community to formulate such a plan by March 28. The mission of the FISA court, named after the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that created it, is to decide whether to grant certain types of government requests -- wiretapping, data analysis, and other monitoring for ""foreign intelligence purposes"" of suspected terrorists and spies operating in the United States. The once-secret approval of collecting bits and pieces of information from electronic communications comes quarterly from judges at the court. To collect the information, the government has to demonstrate to a judge that it is ""relevant"" to an international terrorism investigation. There were 1,856 applications in 2012 to the FISA Court for electronic surveillance and physical searches for ""foreign intelligence purposes,"" the Justice Department said. The current case is In re: Application of the FBI for an Order Requiring the Production of Tangible Things (BR 14-01).","Judge with secret FISA court said the government has not overcome privacy concerns .

"(CNN) -- The co-founder of Rap Genius, an online-annotation website, has been fired after marking up the 137-page manifesto of California killer Elliot Rodger with comments that are being called tasteless and creepy. Mahbod Moghadam used his site, which lets users post notes interpreting rap and hip-hop lyrics, to comment on Rodger's exhaustive autobiography, which includes his reasons for killing six people in Santa Barbara, California, on Friday before apparently turning a gun on himself. In more than one note, Moghadam called Rodger's writing ""beautiful,"" and in another he speculated on the attractiveness of Rodger's sister. In a journal and in a video posted online, Rodger had expressed frustrations about not finding women to date and resentment toward couples who kissed in front of him. He also wrote that his anger toward women intensified after he overheard his sister having sex with her boyfriend. ""MY GUESS: his sister is smokin hot,"" Moghadam wrote. Moghadam also made comments about a girl Rodger described as the only female his age he ever saw naked. ""Maddy will go on to attend USC and become a spoiled hottie,"" Moghadam wrote, before adding, ""This is an artful sentence, beautifully written... ."" Rap Genius has removed the notations. But they were captured and reposted online by Gawker, Re/code and other news sites. Why #YesAllWomen took off on Twitter . On Monday, Rap Genius co-founder and CEO Tom Lehman released a written statement saying that Moghadam had resigned. ""Mahbod Moghadam, one of my co-founders, annotated the piece with annotations that not only didn't attempt to enhance anyone's understanding of the text, but went beyond that into gleeful insensitivity and misogyny,"" he wrote. ""All of which is contrary to everything we're trying to accomplish at Rap Genius."" Lehman continued: ""Mahbod is my friend. He's a brilliant, creative, complicated person with a ton of love in his heart. Without Mahbod Rap Genius would not exist, and I am grateful for all he has done to help Rap Genius succeed. ""But I cannot let him compromise the Rap Genius mission -- a mission that remains almost as delicate and inchoate as it was when we three founders decided to devote our lives to it almost 5 years ago."" Lehman said the site, which describes its mission as helping users ""discover the meaning of rap lyrics,"" decided to post Rodger's writings in hopes that users' annotations ""will eventually be a good resource for people looking to understand this tragedy."" Part One of Rodger's writings currently appears on Rap Genius between breakdowns of the lyrics to ""Believe Me"" by Lil Wayne and John Legend's ""All Of Me."" In December, Google penalized Rap Genius after a user exposed what he called a scheme to manipulate search results and drive traffic to the site. The site removed the offending links and regained its Google ranking. As is frequently the case in today's digital world, the social-media backlash against Moghadam's comments was fast and brutal. ""Appalling use of technology by already questionable behaving site,"" Re/code co-executive editor Kara Swisher wrote on Twitter with a link to that site's story. ""What's most newsworthy about the story of the Rap Genius founder isn't that he was fired but that he didn't think his words were wrong,"" tweeted author and tech journalist Ed Bott. Observers also criticized Moghadam's own Twitter feed, which features many posts that could be viewed as crude at best and sexist at worst. On Monday, Moghadam took to Twitter to beg forgiveness for his comments. ""I want to apologize to everyone,"" he wrote. ""I need to hear these criticisms, reflect for real, and work on becoming a better person.""","Rap Genius co-founder made insensitive comments about killer's manifesto .

"(CNN) -- Images of repression and brutality against peaceful protesters demanding democracy and the elimination of corruption are not limited to Ukraine. In our hemisphere, Venezuelans are suffering at the hands of their own government. Violence and systematic human rights abuses have resulted in 41 dead, hundreds injured, and thousands detained. These rights violations in Venezuela were chronicled this month by Human Rights Watch in a 103-page report, entitled ""Punished for Protesting: Rights Violations in Venezuela's Streets, Detention Centers, and Justice System."" The study pulls back the veil of President Nicolas Maduro's administration and shows its willingness to go to dangerous extremes to silence political dissent. It depicts an unraveling situation in Venezuela far worse than suspected. The litany of rights violations is illustrated in graphic fashion: the unlawful use of force, violent mass arrests, crackdowns on free speech and press freedom, blanket denial of due process, and abuses in detention facilities, including electric shock torture. Employing tactics perfected by the Cuban regime, marauding Venezuelan security forces are shown teaming up with armed gangs known as colectivos to beat unarmed demonstrators, firing live ammunition and tear gas canisters indiscriminately into crowds. In one instance, according to the report, a member of the National Guard ""stepped on (a young protester's) head and fired rubber bullets at point-blank range in his thigh. The shot struck a set of keys in his pocket, dispersing metal shards as well as rubber pellets into his leg."" He was then taken to a military detention facility, denied medical treatment for hours, and lost so much blood that he was near death when finally permitted to see a doctor. While pro-democracy protesters are not fault-free in the use of violence, the primary responsibility for the horrifying, unjustified use of force rests with Maduro and his band of apparatchiks. Venezuela's alleged socialist paradise has morphed into a verifiable real-life nightmare. At a time when many countries in the Americas are experiencing an economic ascent underpinned by growing middle classes, every indicator reveals that Venezuela is regressing at an alarming rate. Frightening levels of criminal violence are coupled with economic freefall, punctuated by sky-high inflation and a scarcity of basic food items. In Venezuela today, the rule of law is abandoned, the judiciary is hollowed out, freedom of the press is nonexistent, and corruption runs rampant. Drug traffickers collude regularly with government officials and the free flow of narcotics out of the country poses a threat to hemispheric security, as well as to the United States. Last month, Maduro pleaded in The New York Times that ""Venezuela needs peace and dialogue to move forward"" -- but instead, he has delivered discord and suffering. With no alternative recourse against the crisis consuming their country, Venezuelan citizens young and old have been turning out in mass demonstrations since early February. Their courage has been met with repression, and the images flooding social media networks induce an outpouring of sympathy, mixed with terror and grief. Attempts by South American governments and the Vatican to mediate talks between the Venezuelan government and political opposition have collapsed and mass arrests continue. The Organization of American States must take a forceful position and demand respect for human rights and democratic inclusion in Venezuela. As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, playing the role of a bystander to this chaos is unacceptable. My response to Maduro-inspired mayhem is authoring bipartisan legislation imposing targeted sanctions on those individuals responsible for violating the rights of peaceful demonstrators. While designed to avoid hurting the Venezuelan people, these hard-hitting penalties include asset freezes and visa bans for high-ranking members of the Maduro administration who have terrorized large segments of the population with unflinching impunity. The legislation also authorizes $15 million to defend human rights, support democratic civil society, and strengthen the rule of law. The moment of action is upon us. On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will pass this legislation. As a nation of the Americas guided by principles of liberty and democracy, we are duty bound to respond when the light of freedom is threatened. #SOSVenezuela is a constant refrain on social media networks, galvanizing international attention to the deteriorating situation in Venezuela.

"Washington (CNN) -- A divided Supreme Court gave a big victory Wednesday to business interests, ruling that a cell phone carrier's arbitration clause in contracts that ban larger class-action lawsuits is permissible. The 5-4 ruling along ideological lines stopped a claim over whether an AT&T cell phone was falsely advertised as ""free."" The plaintiffs wanted to bring others into a larger putative class action. At issue was whether federal law has sway over-- or ""pre-empts""-- state contract laws. Several states have tossed out many class-action barriers by businesses as ""unconscionable"" and therefore unenforceable. Writing for the majority, Justice Antonin Scalia said class arbitration cannot be forced on parties when their contract explicitly prohibits it. ""The California law in question stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the purposes and objectives"" of federal arbitration standards, he said. The financial stakes are huge and both sides of the case had lined up an impressive list of allies. Competing arguments were made about whether the high court ruling would end either arbitration or class action, as both currently exist. Consumer protection groups say this ruling against them will make it easier for companies to use the fine print in business and employment contracts to get away with widespread fraud to consumers and discrimination of its own workers. But business groups worry a flood of frivolous lawsuits would ensue if consumers can file large class-action lawsuits -- involving perhaps thousands of plaintiffs -- that industries say would be costly to the economy and to competition. The justices are currently deciding a separate case involving what would become the largest class-action in U.S. history, a workplace discrimination claim by female employees of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's biggest retailer. A ruling in that case is expected within two months. The case announced Wednesday involves Vincent and Liza Concepcion, who signed a purchase agreement eight years ago for cellular phone service in California. AT&T Mobility advertised a ""free"" Nokia phone with the purchase of a $150 Motorola phone. The company then charged sales tax on both devices, totaling about $30. The Concepcions objected, but because of the small amount at stake, they did not want to sue by themselves. They decided to press the claim on behalf of other phone purchasers as well. The service agreement the couple signed included the phrase, in capital letters: ""You and AT&T agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding."" After the lawsuit was filed, AT&T revised its arbitration provisions in a way that a federal court concluded greatly benefited the consumer. But federal courts also agreed the Concepcion class-action lawsuit could proceed, citing California law that said some contracts can be considered unenforceable if they are built on deception, are too one-sided, or violate broader public policy. The company then appealed, citing the Federal Arbitration Act, an 85-year-old congressional law permitting class-action exemptions to stand when combined with arbitration. Wednesday's high court ruling now gives AT&T the power now to have the phone dispute handled by a private arbiter, who would only weigh the specific competing claims and render a binding ruling. Scalia noted that arbitration is a generally faster and cheaper alternative to a civil trial that could drag on for years, including appeals. Adding class-action status often only adds to the time and money expended. Jury verdicts can also in some cases lead to massive judgments against firms convicted of corporate wrongdoing. ""The aggregation of claims in class arbitration greatly increases the stakes for the defendant,"" said Scalia. ""And when stakes are very high, the informality of arbitration becomes much less appealing, because there is little opportunity for judicial review to correct the mistakes that informality produces."" He was supported by Chief Justice John Roberts, and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito. In dissent, Stephen Breyer warned requiring consumers to arbitrate disputes on an individual basis could lead them to walk away rather than litigate, if the typical monetary stakes are relatively small. ""What rational lawyer would have signed on to represent the Concepcions in litigation for the possibility of fees stemming from a $30.22 claim?"" said Breyer. ""Why is this kind of decision-- weighing the pros and cons of all class proceedings alike-- not California's to make?"" Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan joined Breyer. The Concepcions were supported by two dozen consumer, civil rights, and worker rights groups, many of whom expressed initial disappointment to the ruling. ""Today's majority opinion is judicial policy-making in its most naked form,"" said Doug Kendall of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center, which filed a legal brief supporting the plaintiffs. ""The Federal Arbitration Act is in no way hostile to class actions, and it specifically preserves a critical role for state law."" But a variety of business interests urged the high court to uphold its precedent in related cases. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce's litigation arm had filed an amicus brief that said ""class arbitration does not deter misconduct, but rather forces parties into costly litigation."" The high court in two separate appeals last spring gave victories to big business over enforceability of arbitration requirements in contracts. The current case is AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion (09-893).","A California couple wanted to contest AT&T's $30 sales tax charge on a ""free"" phone .

"Editor's note: A nationally syndicated columnist, Roland S. Martin is the author of ""Listening to the Spirit Within: 50 Perspectives on Faith"" and ""Speak, Brother! A Black Man's View of America."" Visit his Web site for more information. Roland S. Martin says issue of Obama's birth certificate is being pushed by conspiracy theorists. (CNN) -- The YouTube video of an out-of-control woman yelling and screaming at Republican Congressman Mike Castle's town hall meeting in Delaware, demanding to see the birth certificate of President Barack Obama, is utterly hilarious. To watch others cheer her insanity, and then boo the congressman who says the president is an American, shows you that we have a serious problem with mental illness in this country. The nut jobs that continue to promote this story are wacky, right-wing radio and TV talk shows hosts and no-credibility bloggers. They have latched onto this story like bloodsucking leeches, and actually want us to believe this story has legs. Last week, in a suit filed by perennial presidential loser, Alan Keyes, they even tried to claim a court victory after a federal district judge in California asked to listen to the merits of their case. I'm sure he simply wanted to see for himself how delusional they are. From the moment President Obama entered the race, he has had to endure the so-called flag-waving American patriots who think they are the arbiters of what's right for the country. What cracks me up is that in order to justify their loony beliefs, they say, ""The president could just end this once and for all by producing the birth certificate."" Do you actually believe these wackos will stop there? They will then accuse the president of doctoring the document and ordering up the state of Hawaii and federal officials to create the birth certificate. The next thing you know, one of those nut job right-wingers in Congress -- and yes, there are left-wing nut jobs as well -- will demand a federal investigation into the production of the birth certificate. During the presidential campaign last year, the issue of whether Barack Obama was a ""natural born citizen"" legally qualified to be president was scrutinized by reporters and researchers who concluded that Obama was born in the United States. For example, in August, 2008, factcheck.org published the following: ""FactCheck.org staffers have now seen, touched, examined and photographed the original birth certificate. We conclude that it meets all of the requirements from the State Department for proving U.S. citizenship. Claims that the document lacks a raised seal or a signature are false."" President Obama is right to ignore these losers. They are right up there with Holocaust deniers like Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and the people who insist that the landing on the moon was done in a television studio. Conspiracy theorists are everywhere. It's just that today, we have to deal with the Internet and all the mess that is disseminated in the name of so-called transparency. So nut jobs, keep it coming. In such difficult times, we all need a good laugh every now and then, and you provide great comic fodder. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S. Martin.","Roland Martin: Conspiracy theorists are focusing on Obama's birth certificate .

"(CNN) -- A zoo in Switzerland is the latest to be embroiled in controversy, after it not only killed a healthy bear cub but will now stuff and display it to teach children that ""nature can be cruel."" Details of the fate of the baby brown bear, known only as Cub 4, come on the heels of outrage over the killing by Denmark's Copenhagen Zoo of a young male giraffe named Marius and four lions. The Dahlholzli Zoo in the Swiss city of Bern said it decided to put down the bear cub after its father, named Misha, mauled its sibling to death and threatened to do the same to Cub 4. According to a media release, the zoo initially decided not to interfere with the bears' ""natural"" behavior. But when it was observed that the mother, Masha, had begun neglecting Cub 4 and that the father was roughing it up too, zoo staff decided in April it would be kinder to kill the youngster. This week, the zoo announced that the cub, whose remains were deep-frozen, would be thawed out and handed over to an expert taxidermist to be stuffed. The hide has been separated from the body and will be tanned and the body measured for a mold. Explaining the process, the zoo said it considers it central to learning that animals are experienced in as natural a condition as possible, including contact with ""animal materials"" like hides, bones or fully stuffed creatures. It added, ""An emotional experience takes priority, which brings nature closer to the children with all its facets -- 'nice' or not -- and makes them tangible."" But criticism of the zoo's actions has focused on the fact that the adult bears involved were hand-raised -- suggesting that their cubs could have been raised that way too. The daily newspaper Berner Zeitung reported in April that the zoo had received a flood of public comment after Cub 4 was killed. It quoted Sara Wehrli, head of the Wild Animal Department of Swiss Animal Protection, as saying the zoo had acted ""irresponsibly"" in its care of the bears. ""Bears are loners and need room, and in zoos, there are already too many brown bears,"" she said. ""Letting the two get pregnant was wrong. You can't leave wild animals in captivity to 'nature.' ""Whoever keeps them must take responsibility for them."" In March, after the controversy over the Copenhagen Zoo's actions, European Association of Zoos and Aquaria spokesman David Williams-Mitchell told CNN that across the European zoos governed by the body, about 3,000 to 5,000 animals are killed each year under programs to manage zoo populations. This includes ""everything from tadpoles and insects up to charismatic megafauna like giraffes and lions,"" he said, adding that it represents only 0.06% of the zoos' overall animal population. Exact figures are hard to come by, but a few hundred of those killed by the zoos each year would be large animals, he said. Williams-Mitchell added that members of the public and animal rights groups tend to object only when zoos kill ""cute, storybook animals,"" rather than rodents or tadpoles.","A brown bear cub will be stuffed and put on display, Swiss zoo says .

"(CNN) -- Pakistan's much-awaited military offensive in North Waziristan was launched more than a week ago, and followed an attack on Karachi airport that left at least 36 people dead. Due to the strategic calculations of the Pakistani state, North Waziristan has steadily fallen into the hands of motley militant networks, and has become a mountainous zone for the Pakistani Taliban to recruit, regroup and launch attacks against the country. The Pakistani Army conducted a similar operation in the Swat Valley in 2009, not too far from the tribal areas, that has been a relative success in reclaiming territory. It is unclear which direction the latest operation will go. But a major humanitarian crisis is brewing in the wake of the new offensive. As of Wednesday, the government had registered over 450,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) who have been fleeing the area in view of the aerial bombardments and warnings by military authorities. There are fears the figures could be much higher. Desperate need for shelter . The military has taken extraordinary steps, especially in terms of its public relations efforts, to minimize the fallout in public perception. It's issuing press releases, specifying how many terrorists have been killed, and giving a count of aid distributed. Yet, thousands of families still need immediate support in terms of livelihood, shelter and basic amenities. While the United Nations has stepped in to provide aid, distribution systems have a long way to go in meeting the scale of demand. Beyond North Waziristan, the Pakhtun population follows the age-old custom of accepting and looking after ""guests."" Predictably, many families fleeing the violence are being absorbed into the towns and villages of Bannu, in neighboring Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province. Bannu town is straining under the pressure of a massive population influx. While local Pakhtuns and civic groups have been engaged, the response of the government authorities has been slow. The disaster management authority (FDMA) in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), underfunded like most government agencies, is battling with the magnitude of the crisis. Government response . The government has established one camp in Bannu, but many more facilities are needed, especially during the hot summer season. A meager grant is being offered to each family for their multifarious needs, but very few have received it so far. The political opposition that rules KP has complained of a funds shortage, and voices in the media have criticized the federal government's inordinate focus on domestic political squabbles and high profile infrastructure projects, ignoring the plight of homeless people. The minister in charge of the government response â€” the Federal Minister for States and Frontier Regions retired Lt Gen Abdul Qadri Baloch -- has said ""every reasonable need of the IDPs will be taken care of in the best possible manner and money is not an issue."" However, he also urged fellow Pakistanis to ""open their pockets."" Few places to go . Pakistan's ethnic politics also impedes free movement of IDPs. While the country's constitution allows for freedom of movement for its citizens, the provincial governments of Sindh and Punjab have restricted the inflow of migrants from the north. The provincial government of Sindh says that it is already dealing with two million ""aliens"" and has attributed the rise of militancy in the port city Karachi due to earlier in-country migrations. Similarly, Punjab, the home province of Pakistan's Prime Minister, has refused to host the displaced people. This policy has been termed illegal by political leaders and has caused resentment not just among the IDPs but Pakistan's Pakhtun population in general. Marginalized population . The people of North Waziristan -- and the tribal region FATA -- have been stranded between the military and the militants for more than a decade. They have dealt with historic marginalization, underdevelopment, high poverty levels and, of late, the polio epidemic. An estimated 160,000 children are vulnerable since the Taliban banned immunization in North Waziristan two years ago, terming immunization as a ""Western conspiracy."" A major worry nationally is that the polio virus may spread faster than it has in recent months. According to government officials, Pakistan has reported 65 polio cases from FATA this year of which 50 alone pertained to North Waziristan. Challenge and opportunities . These grave challenges require leadership and effective interagency coordination. Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has set up a high level body that monitors the day-to-day situation. But, it is the local authorities that need more funds and broader mandates. The risks of aggravating the already marginalized people are manifold. Increased radicalization is one since the area is an open field for charities affiliated with extremist organizations. There are opportunities as well. Free of Taliban diktat, there is a greater scope for immunization campaigns for the children now. There is also an opportunity to rebuild FATA, which has been governed since the British times as a remote outpost of the Empire with little or no rights for the local population. Earlier reform efforts led nowhere. Political and administrative reforms must follow the military operations. Local governments and courts are needed for the area. Pakistan's tribal belt has to evolve from its current status as a ""strategic,"" semi-colonial arena to a democratic polity. This requires a civil-military consensus. For now, the country must tackle the growing numbers of homeless and avoid another catastrophe in the making.

"(CNN) -- Each Father's Day, I thank my father for giving me life -- twice -- the first time in the traditional sense and the second when he donated his kidney to me. When I speak about getting him a Father's Day gift, he says the best gift I can give him is to live a good, healthy life. Five years ago, we were in the OR, side by side as one of his kidneys was transferred into my body, saving my life. I had been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes the summer I turned 17, and now, 20 years later, my kidneys were so damaged from the ups and downs of sugar in my blood that my medical team told me I needed either to get on dialysis or to receive a new organ from a deceased donor or a living relative. To my father, the choice was simple -- he said, ""Let's do it next week."" I marveled at his ability to make a quick decision that would alter both of our bodies forever. During the pre-operation testing period, we spent a lot of time together. We kept our spirits high and our minds off the possibility of a failure or a postponement (if one of us got sick, for instance, or if my kidneys got worse and I needed dialysis) by making plans for the future -- all the things we wanted to do individually and apart. Before he knew of my condition, my father, 63, had made plans to climb to Mount Everest's base camp with close friends, and it was scheduled for about two months after surgery. I was worried about the short recovery time, but he kept his sights on this adventure of a lifetime in addition to my regaining my health. As a debt of gratitude to my dad (who finished his Mount Everest trek in good health), I created my new company, Lyfebulb, an organization that aims to connect and help people with chronic disease and inspire them to lead better lives. The ultimate goal is curing people of diabetes, kidney disease and other chronic illnesses, but while scientists in academia and industry fight that battle, I wanted to create a place both online and offline, for people to enjoy the small pleasures in life, share their stories, learn about new treatments and medications, and find resources. Many people are not as fortunate as I was. As noted in the 2013 U.S. Renal Data System, about 34% of patients with diabetes survive five years after initiation of hemodialysis and 10% were alive after 10 years. Waiting for an organ on the regular transplant list may take years. Those years are tough ones, and when the organ finally arrives, it may be too late. I believe that many more people would do what my father did for me if they knew more about the transplant process and outcomes. Improving access to organs is crucial now that the rate of diabetes is exploding and the average age of people living is increasing. We will be faced with many individuals needing an organ who may not have someone to ask who is educated about the risks, healthy enough to be approved and willing to step up to the plate. Since the transplant, my father and I have celebrated holidays, gone skiing, enjoyed wine, argued and laughed -- essentially behaved like a normal father and daughter -- with the exception that we share his original pair of kidneys. Every day I remind myself what a precious gift my father has given me. I am alive today thanks to my father, and I hope to make him proud. One day a year isn't enough to celebrate and thank my father for all he has done for me. To show my appreciation, the best gift I will give my dad this Father's Day is to take care of my health and to live each day to its fullest. It's the gift I've been giving him each year since we were in the OR side by side. And I plan on giving that gift to him for many Father's Days to come. Opinion: Son, this is how to be a man .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel's prime minister on Saturday gave security forces the OK to use ""all measures"" at their disposal to find and free three teenagers believed kidnapped in an area of Jewish settlements in the West Bank. The teens have been missing since late Thursday or Friday, having last been seen around Gush Etzion, according to Israel Defense Forces. ""(They were) kidnapped by a terror organization, there is no doubt about that,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a nationally televised address Saturday. While it wasn't clear which group is behind the alleged abductions, Netanyahu stated explicitly that ""it is the responsibility"" of the Palestinian Authority to do something about the teens. To that point, Netanyahu said he's asked the Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas ""to do everything to help bring them back in peace."" Netanyahu said he's given security force leaders orders to locate the teenagers and prevent them from being moved to Gaza or any other place. Already, dozens of Palestinians have been arrested in the southern part of the West Bank in connection with the search, and Israeli forces have been reinforced by a paratroop brigade, an Israeli military source said earlier Saturday. The official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported at least 12 people had been arrested in West Bank. The IDF is looking at all scenarios as it seeks to identify who is behind the believed kidnapping, and it has not ruled out the possibility that the perpetrators will try to reach Gaza, the source said. There is ongoing security coordination with the Palestinian security services, who understand that this ""is not just some terror attack. It has substantial meaning to us,"" the source said. A burned-out car is being examined for any possible connection to the teens' disappearance. The deployment of military assets to search for the teens, and the swift presumption of kidnapping, are a reflection of the tensions that exist between Jewish settlers and Palestinians in the West Bank. The expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank has been a lasting point of contention in the region. It has altered the map of the Palestinian territories, making it more difficult to draw a contiguous Palestinian state as part of any peace agreement, according to critics. The highly contentious issue of Israeli construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians seek for a future state, has hurt peace efforts.","NEW: Palestinian news agency reports 12 people have been arrested .

"(CNN) -- CNN Pentagon Correspondent Barbara Starr reported Thursday that the U.S. intelligence community has information that Russian artillery is firing into eastern Ukraine. The artillery pieces shown in the released footage are Russian M-46 130mm field guns with a range of a little over 16 miles. Why would the Russians do this? Simple -- this fits into their plan to support pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. The end game? I believe it is the eventual absorption of that region into the Russian Federation. The area in red on the map is where much of the fighting between the Ukrainian government and the pro-Russian rebels has been occurring over the last month. The separatists have downed several Ukrainian military aircraft in this area as the fighting raged. It is also the area in which Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down in what most of us believe was a tragic case of mistaken identity and inept use of modern weaponry. Over the past month, the Ukrainians have been successful in pushing the rebels into a pocket near the Russian border. One of the key weapons used by the Ukrainians is the Sukhoi Su-25 ground attack/close air support jet fighter. It is heavily armed and armored, meant to fly low and attack personnel and vehicles with a variety of weapons. Flying low makes it vulnerable to ground fire, however, especially shoulder-launched MANPADS, which are the heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles in the rebels' arsenal (also supplied by the Russians). Pentagon: Russia getting ready to send more powerful weaponry into Ukraine . To address some of the vulnerability to ground fire, pilots can fly higher than the effective ranges of MANPADS. Defending against these higher-flying aircraft requires a more advanced and capable air defense system -- like the SA-11 (called the ""Buk"" system by the Russians). From a variety of reports, it appears that the Russians provided a Buk transporter-erector-launcher-and-radar (TELAR) to the separatists. There is footage of an SA-11 TELAR being moved from this contested area toward the Russian border immediately after MH17 was shot down. Just three days before, on June 14, the rebels shot down a Ukrainian military Antonov An-26 twin-turboprop cargo aircraft flying at an altitude of 21,000 feet. Since this altitude is significantly above the range of the MANPADS in either the Ukrainian or rebel arsenal, the obvious conclusion is that it was downed with a more capable system: the SA-11 system supplied by the Russians. That event alone should have set off alarm bells in the civil aviation community. The downing of any aircraft operating at that altitude presented a different threat scenario than would an area in which shoulder-fired missiles were the only threat to aviation. The subsequent -- and I believe mistaken -- downing of MH17 forced the rebels and their Russian sponsors to remove the SA-11 system from eastern Ukraine, although it is obvious to most observers what had happened. Without the improved air defense umbrella provided by the SA-11, the separatists found themselves again subject to effective Ukrainian air strikes. On Wednesday, two Ukrainian Su-25 fighters were shot down while operating at an altitude of 17,000 feet -- just above the range of MANPADS, yet still at an altitude to deliver munitions with a degree of accuracy. The Ukrainians believe the aircraft were downed with SA-11 missiles, but this time fired from inside Russian territory. The SA-11 has enough range to reach not only that altitude, but more than 20 miles into Ukrainian territory. In a further development, on Thursday it appeared that the Russians had also begun fire support for the rebels, firing artillery from inside Russian territory into eastern Ukraine. While the M-46 130mm field gun seen in the photos can reach out to about 16 miles, the Russians have other systems that can reach as far as 25 miles or more. This represents a significant change in the situation between Russia and Ukraine. Providing material support -- the money, weapons and training required to mount an effective insurgency -- to groups in foreign countries is a recognized method of assisting groups that are either carrying out your wishes or are furthering a foreign policy objective. We have done it routinely. Afghanistan is a prime example. Firing artillery rounds into another sovereign nation with whom you are not at war is another matter entirely. This would be an act of war, yes, but it underscores just how seriously the Russians (read: President Vladimir Putin) view the survival of the pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine and their hopes that their continued fighting will achieve a key foreign policy objective. Putin believes these rebels are his ticket to gradually acquiring eastern Ukraine without a Russian military invasion. This use of artillery in the midst of the international furor over the MH17 incident demonstrates his seriousness. On Friday, the Ukrainians reportedly responded to the Russian artillery fire with mortar fire across the Russian border. This represents a significant escalation of the tensions along that border -- what was once an internal (albeit externally supported) conflict between Ukrainian nationals and pro-Russian separatists now has the trappings of a cross-border fight between two sovereign nations, one of which has immensely greater military power. Both sides are calculating their next moves. From the Russian perspective, with its approximately 15,000 troops deployed along the border, this artillery fire is logical and almost obligatory support for ethnic Russians who they believe would rather be part of the Russian Federation. From the Ukrainian perspective, this is Russian meddling in their internal affairs. Military action from the Russian side will draw a Ukrainian armed response. This is understandable, but the Ukrainians need to ensure that they are not playing into Vladimir Putin's game plan. At some point, the Russians may declare that they need to intervene to protect ""Russian nationals in eastern Ukraine."" Sound far-fetched? Remember Crimea. Motyl: Putin, just evil enough .

"(CNN) -- Days after a nationally renowned criminal law professor was found with a gunshot wound to his head, his death is being investigated as a homicide. Florida State University professor Dan Markel was found in his Tallahassee, Florida, home on Friday. Police say there were no signs of robbery or burglary and have yet to disclose any motive. According to Tallahassee police, officers found Markel after a neighbor called 911 at about 11 a.m. with reports of a ""loud bang."" Markel, 41, was rushed to a local hospital, where he died the following day. ""While we cannot release specific information or details regarding this case, the Violent Crimes Unit is releasing that Mr. Markel's cause of death was a fatal gunshot wound to the head,"" Tallahassee Police Chief Michael DeLeo said in a statement. By Monday, police had categorized the case as a homicide, and according to Tallahassee Police Department spokesman David Northway, Markel was the intended target. Police created a tip line and offered a $3,000 reward. Within 24 hours, authorities received several leads, which they are pursuing, Northway said. Authorities are also asking anyone who was in Markel's neighborhood between 10 a.m. and noon Friday to contact police. ""This includes delivery drivers, visitors to the neighborhood or even pedestrians that were walking in the area who may have seen or heard anything that would lead investigators to the suspect in this case,"" a police news release says. Though police assured the community that Markel's killing was not likely a random act, there was still confusion and concern in Tallahassee. ""We were all shocked,"" former student Tony Fusco told CNN affiliate WCTV. ""We didn't know why. We didn't know how. We just heard he was gone, and it was a big shock to all of us."" According to the university, Markel began working at FSU in 2005 after receiving his bachelor's at Harvard College, a master's from the University of Cambridge and a law degree from Harvard. During his FSU tenure, the Toronto native taught several classes and wrote extensively about criminal law, including articles published in the Yale Law Review, among others. Markel also founded PrawfsBlawg, a blog focused on law and life, and his writing appeared in publications such as The New York Times, Slate, The Jerusalem Post and The Atlantic Monthly. On Sunday, friends, family members, students and colleagues gathered at a Tallahassee synagogue to remember the father and scholar, according to WCTV. ""I am filled with awe and appreciation for the support of our friends and family and particularly for the show of admiration, respect and love for Danny from this Tallahassee family,"" his sister, Shelly Markel, said, according to the station. On the PrawfsBlawg front page, 10 fellow law professors posted about the respect they had for Markel and the mutual love he shared with his friends and family. ""His boundless energy was at the center of this community; it made it run, it gave it life. We are stunned and bereaved by his loss, and our thoughts go to his two little boys, who were precious to him, and to his family."" Florida State also issued a statement, saying in part: ""His contributions to Florida State University College of Law and the broader legal community are pervasive and lasting. ... We will feel his loss for many years to come."" Markel was divorced from fellow FSU law professor Wendi Adelson last summer, according to her attorney, Jimmy Judkins. ""She is a basket case, distraught, very emotional,"" said Judkins, who told CNN his client has no idea why this happened. Police have been in contact with Adelson, the attorney said.

"(CNN) -- A Venezuelan prosecutor on Friday formally charged opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez with public incitement, property damage, arson and conspiracy. General Prosecutor Luisa Ortega Diaz announced the charges at a press conference in Caracas, a day before the legal deadline to keep Lopez in custody expires. Lopez, 42, a former mayor and presidential candidate, has been held in a military jail for well more than a month. The government of President Nicolas Maduro originally accused him of terrorism and murder, but those charges were later dropped. He is accused of inciting anti-government protests throughout Venezuela that began February 12. Venezuela's state run news agency said that 39 people have died and more than 600 injured in clashes. The government blames the protests on ""a wave of violence fostered by right-wing leaders in the country."" If found guilty, Lopez could face nearly 14 years in prison. Lopez, a fiery speaker and charismatic leader, has long been a threat to the socialists in power in Venezuela. Back in 2008, the government of then-President Hugo Chavez banned him from running for public office, accusing him of corruption and misuse of public funds. Lopez countered that it was all political retribution and that he had nothing to hide. He took his case all the way to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, where he was cleared three years later. Earlier this year, Lopez organized protests demanding better security, an end to shortages and protected freedom of speech.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A California city filed for bankruptcy Wednesday, the third in the Golden State to do so in recent weeks, stoking experts' concerns that other cities could follow suit. The city of San Bernardino, with more than 200,000 residents on the eastern tip of greater Los Angeles, ""filed an emergency petition for Chapter 9 Bankruptcy"" with a regional U.S. bankruptcy court, according to a news release from the city's interim manager. The other two to file recently were Stockton, with around 300,000 residents, according to 2010 U.S. census data, and Mammoth Lakes, a resort town, where visitors and seasonal residents outnumber the just over 8,000 permanent inhabitants. Why U.S. cities are going bankrupt . Many municipalities in the Golden State and around the nation are struggling to cover their costs as the economic malaise continues to hurt tax revenue streams, experts said. This will lead to more municipal bankruptcies, which have been rare until now. ""This is not the end. This is the beginning,"" Peter Navarro, business professor at University of California, Irvine, told CNN recently. ""As cities see it can be done and is being done, it will give them the idea to do it."" Eric Hoffman, an analyst at Moody's Investor Service agreed, saying more city bankruptcies are likely in California and throughout the nation. Cities have also struggled from budget changes made on the state level. Because of massive budget shortfalls, Gov. Jerry Brown and the state legislature made changes to vehicle tax money and redevelopment agencies that stripped locales of hundreds of millions in state funding. San Bernardino said it will continue to provide services during the bankruptcy phase. Rhode Island city asks retirees to cut their pensions . ""There will be no immediate service reductions or changes in service to the community as a result of the filing,"" interim city manager Andrea Travis-Miller said Wednesday. But ""reductions may occur"" in the future. In a prior statement Travis-Miller hinted the city may continue to ""negotiate in good faith with its creditors."" In early July, Miller and finance director Jason Simpson issued a report stating that the city was facing insolvency and its expenditures were projected to exceed revenues by $45 million. The city's general fund reserves had been as high as $19 million in 2001 but are now depleted, the report said. ""The city has reached a breaking point,"" the report said. Some $10 million to $16 million in annual revenue has evaporated in recent years as taxable sales dried up and property values plummeted in the city, the report said. Mammoth Lakes sought protection July 2 after a property developer won a $43 million court judgment against the resort town. Experts say this filing should not be lumped in with the other two California municipal bankruptcies since it was an unusual circumstance. Stockton, however, filed for bankruptcy in late June after three months of mediation when creditors failed to close a $26 million budget shortfall. The city had already addressed $90 million in deficits over the past three years, mainly through reducing services and employee compensation. Video: Declaring bankruptcy in Harrisburg . Both Stockton's and San Bernardino's fiscal troubles are due in large part to the massive housing downturn and recession that swept across California. Both towns were hit particularly hard by the foreclosure crisis, which left numerous abandoned homes and reduced property values in its wake. That led to lower property tax revenues, critical to supporting public services. While some areas of the Golden State are starting to recover, the regions containing those two towns are not, said Chris McKenna, executive director of the League of California Cities. By filing for bankruptcy, cities will be able to keep police and firefighters on the street and possibly keep some parks and libraries open while they work out their finances, he said.

"(CNN) -- When Chelsie Shellhas saw a tall young man slip into a storage locker and shut the door behind him one evening this week, it just looked wrong. She dialed 911. Her instincts were right: Behind the door were bomb-making materials, police in Waseca, Minnesota, said Thursday. Her call thwarted a cunningly planned gun and bomb attack at a school, they say. John David LaDue, 17, was looking to carry it out in the coming weeks, police said in an official statement. After Shellhas' call on Tuesday, officers arrived at the storage park to find LaDue among an assortment of gunpowder, pyrotechnic chemicals, ball bearings and a pressure cooker, police said. CNN does not usually publish the names of minors charged with crimes but is naming LaDue in this case, because his name has been widely reported in his community. Police locked up the storage bay and took LaDue in for a voluntary interview. He shared a macabre plan, police said. His tale and recovered evidence resulted in charges of four counts of attempted murder, six counts of explosives possessions and related property damage charges. He is being charged as a juvenile, said prosecutor Brenda Miller. Alleged plan: Kill the family first . First, LaDue was planning to kill his father, mother and sister, police said. He was particularly close to his sister, their music tutor said. Ryan Lano gave LaDue guitar lessons for four years. ""He would almost always come in with his sister, who played the drums,"" he said. After their slayings, the teen, who idealized the Columbine school shooters, allegedly wanted to set a fire. The arson, however, would only be a diversion to tie up emergency responders while he carried out the main plot at the school, police said. He'd planned to set off ""numerous bombs"" during the lunch hour at Waseca Junior/Senior High School, then kill the school resource officer, police said. Then he'd unleash gunfire on students until police officers arrived, allegedly planning to let them kill him. Armed to the teeth . The teen's cache in the storage locker contained just pieces of the puzzle. Police got a search warrant and at 10:30 p.m. arrived at LaDue's home, where he lived with his family. Behind that door lay finished bombs, ""numerous guns"" and ammunition, police say. And they found LaDue's neatly laid plan journaled onto paper. A bomb squad removed all recovered explosives and destroyed them by controlled detonation at a local airport. Seemed up to no good . Shellhas and others in her building first saw a young man in their backyard, Shellhas' cousin Katy Harty told CNN's Brooke Baldwin. As they watched him fiddle with the storage unit for about 10 minutes, they thought perhaps he was trying to break in, Harty said. Shellhas picked up the phone, and 10 minutes later, police were taking LaDue in. His alleged plan hit frighteningly close to home. Harty's younger brother is a senior at the targeted school. Her cousin is a freshman there. ""It's scary; we're both, like, really glad that we did call and didn't just shrug it off,"" she said. 'Liked' guns, dark entertainment . If his Facebook page is any indicator, LaDue is partial to the dark side, and he ""likes"" assault rifles: the AK-101, Heckler & Koch SL8 and Steyr TMP. In a photo, he can be seen picking an electric guitar with a skull on its shoulder strap; his preferred bands -- more than 190 of them in total -- are predominantly heavy metal. His taste in movies is dominated by blood, gore, combat and fisticuffs. His favorite authors are Stephen King and a more traditional master of literary darkness, Edgar Allen Poe. LaDue also seems to like to hunt. His avatar is a picture of himself in hunter's orange, posing with a slain deer with a rifle draped over it. It was not immediately clear Thursday whether LaDue had retained an attorney. His mother preferred not to give a statement but told CNN before hanging up the phone: ""Our family is dealing with a lot of grief."" LaDue, 17, was in juvenile detention Friday and has made death threats to facility staff, a prosecutor said. A lucky calendar this year may have prevented him from hatching his plan already. He had wanted to carry it out on April 20, the 15th anniversary of the mass shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado. But the date fell on Easter week this year, when school was out. Opinion: I'm a gun owner and I want gun control . CNN's Dana Ford, Emily Smith, Carma Hassan and Sean Nottingham contributed to this report.","John LaDue planned to kill father, mother, sister, police say .

"(CNN)  -- It was both painful and strange for Robert Soulas and his wife, Corinne, as they stared across the Atlantic. The ocean still held the bodies of their daughter and son-in-law, three months after the crash of Air France Flight 447. That day in 2009, standing along the shoreline of Brazil's festive Ipanema Beach was as close as the Soulases could come to the spot hundreds of miles offshore where 24-year-old Caroline Marie and Sebastian Vedovati, 34, had taken their last breaths. ""You are crying, you are praying, you are thinking about your child, while beside you, you can hear people laughing and playing,"" said Robert Soulas on the phone Wednesday from his home outside Paris. ""It was not a good country for grieving -- for crying."" The Soulases' daughter and her flight attendant husband were among the 228 victims aboard the Airbus A330 which disappeared from radar between South America and Africa en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris. In the two years since the crash, the Soulases say they've been haunted by the pain of not knowing why the plane went down. Map of Flight 447's route . It was only this month that searchers were able to find the aircraft's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder -- the so-called black boxes -- in mountainous terrain under 13,000 feet of ocean. The first information from that data is expected to be made public on Friday. Investigators will be able to ID bodies, official says . But if data from those devices had been uplinked from the plane to satellites immediately before the crash, would hundreds of victims' loved ones have been spared some anguish? ""If we'd had the technology before, we would now have the causes of the crash and it would be less painful,"" said Robert Soulas, a 59-year-old electrical engineer who works in the French defense industry. He helps lead a group of more than 300 others who also lost loved ones aboard Flight 447, all of whose grief would be less intense, he said, if they could only know why. Did the plane crash because of pilot error or bad weather or equipment malfunction? Speculation has been easy to come by, but answers have been elusive. What caused the crash? Two years ago in Washington, the Air France crash spurred U.S. aviation safety officials to look into uplinking critical flight data to orbiting satellites from airplanes flying across vast oceans. Here's how advocates say such a system would work: Currently flight data recorders use computer chips to record information about how the plane is working in flight. Another device, the cockpit voice recorder, records audio from crew members including pilots. If the plane crashes over a large body of water, the devices can't be retrieved without help from special recovery teams. See photos of Flight 447 black boxes and wreckage . A new system being researched by the National Transportation Safety Board would uplink airplane data about its location, direction, equipment functions and about 30 other parameters to orbiting satellites, which would then beam the data back to the ground for storage. In the event of a crash, that data could be easily accessed from the storage sites and then analyzed for clues to what caused the disaster. Advocates say such a system -- although pricey -- could save millions of dollars in operations to recover on-board flight data devices. Searching for the Air France devices and aircraft wreckage cost $40 million, according to a report by France's aviation investigation agency, the Bureau d'Enquetes et Analyses. ""Fortunately they found these boxes,"" said Greg Feith, a former NTSB investigator, ""but who knows, tomorrow we could lose another airplane and not be so lucky."" The time saved by having immediate access to aircraft data offers critical safety benefits, said Feith, because experts could warn airlines sooner about potential equipment problems blamed for the crash. But skeptics cite several reasons why in-flight data uplinks might not work, including high costs, limited bandwidth, security concerns, privacy issues, and cumbersome aviation bureaucracies. In fact, two powerful government bureaucracies with oversight of the U.S. aviation industry -- the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration -- disagree about the promise of in-flight uplinks. ""While the technology may exist, the use of telemetry for commercial airplanes is not currently practical due to bandwidth issues,"" said an FAA spokeswoman. Jim Cash, the NTSB's chief technical adviser for vehicle recorders, who's been studying flight recorder technology for decades, is optimistic about a solution. Bandwidth issues can be beat, Cash says, by limiting data and only uploading it to satellites when necessary. The data upload would begin automatically if the plane shows signs of distress during flight. ""You wouldn't get a continuous data stream -- it would be activated by an automatic trigger -- but at least you would get the data when it counts,"" said Cash. The NTSB and France's BEA are asking the industry for data from past accidents to help design ""trigger criteria"" that would be used to activate the uplink system. ""Airbus is seriously looking at providing that triggering criteria technology as standard equipment on large aircraft,"" said Cash. A BEA report on the crash of Flight 447 said uplink technology would cost more than $10,000 to retrofit each airliner. However, Cash says much of the satellite uplink technology already exists aboard many of the world's newer airliners as part of a ground-to-plane messaging technology called the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System. Sarasota, Florida-based L-3 Communications Aviation Recorders makes about 60% of flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorders used on U.S. aircraft, according to vice president of engineering Tom Schmutz. ""People can't understand why we can't simply strap a cell phone onto an airplane and move a bunch of data around,"" said Schmutz. ""This is a complicated system. Complicated systems cost a lot of money. They don't always work right. I'm a little skeptical about, one, how necessary it is right now, and two, how realistic it is that somebody's going to foot the bill for this in the short term."" Representing the airline industry, the Air Transport Association says it's concerned about the potential cost and wants to assess the overall need for such a system within the aviation community. But Peter Goelz, former top NTSB administrator, says an uplink system ""ought to be ordered immediately for all extended range aircraft right away. We ought to just do it. There's no reason not to."" ""The aviation industry historically fights what they consider to be extraneous safety mandates, particularly if it costs them money that they cannot immediately recover,"" said Goelz, who compared the situation to the cargo hold fire that led to the 1996 Florida crash of ValuJet Flight 592, which killed all 110 passengers and crew. Goelz said he and his NTSB colleagues fought industry push-back for their recommendation that smoke detectors and fire suppression systems be mandatory equipment in airplane cargo holds. ""It cost about 10% of what they thought it was going to be, and we haven't had any fires in cargo holds since then,"" he said. ""There's always an opposition."" Industry figures worry about other questions that may trouble developers of the uplink system, including how to protect the data from hackers. Uplinked audio likely would have to be encrypted, experts say, because privacy laws protect audio from cockpit voice recorders from being released to the public. The NTSB considered other methods of collecting data from troubled aircraft, including ""deployable"" systems that would eject from distressed planes to be picked up later by search teams. Researchers determined satellite uplinks to be the most promising. The Transportation Security Administration is looking into the possibility of using similar technology to monitor hijacked aircraft, said Cash. At their home in France, the Soulases hope clues from the newly found data recorders will shed some light on why their loved ones died, two long years ago. ""I will be in peace when I know the truth,"" Robert Soulas said. ""I need to know exactly what happened.""","Experts question why black box data isn't uploaded to satellites .
Critics: It's expensive and needs too much bandwidth .
Advocates: It would have eased grief for Air France crash victims .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The man arrested at Sandra Bullock's home last week allegedly owns ""an arsenal of weapons"" that included a half dozen illegal machine guns. Joshua Corbett, who was charged with stalking Bullock, burglarizing her home and possessing one illegal gun, now faces much more serious charges, according to the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. The discovery of the arsenal during a search of Corbett's Montrose, California, home has led to 19 felony counts, including seven counts of possession of a machine gun, two counts of possession of an assault weapon and 10 counts of possession of a destructive device, the prosecutor's spokeswoman said. DA: Stalker spent hour in Sandra Bullock's home . A judge raised Corbett's bond from the $185,000 set when he pleaded not guilty last week to $2.2 million Wednesday. He is being held in the Los Angeles County jail. Los Angeles police arrested Corbett, 39, at Bullock's home in the early morning hours of June 8 after he allegedly climbed a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire that surrounded it. Investigators believe he sent more than an hour inside before he was found. Bullock was home at the time, but police have not said whether her young son also was there. Little information about Corbett has been released, although CNN confirmed through FAA records that he has a private pilot's license. The charges carry a potential maximum of 12 years in prison, if the suspect is convicted, Deputy District Attorney Wendy Segall said.","Police found the arsenal of weapons in a search of Joshua Corbett's home, the DA says .

"(CNN) -- Look out Lannisters ... Windsor is coming. Queen Elizabeth came face to face with royalty of a very different kind when she met the cunning Cersei -- otherwise known as actress Lena Headey -- on a visit to the ""Game of Thrones"" set in Northern Ireland on Tuesday. The monarch and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, were touring Belfast when they called in at the sound stage where the hit show -- famed for its violent scenes and frequent nudity -- is filmed. ""Game of Thrones"" showrunner David Benioff and writer and producer Daniel Weiss guided the royal party around the Paint Hall studio in the city's Titanic Quarter. During the visit, the Queen met the show's prop and costume makers and set designers, as well as actors Kit Harrington (Jon Snow), Maisie Williams (Arya Stark), Conleth Hill (Lord Varys) and Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark). The Queen was spotted looking with interest at the Iron Throne, supposedly forged from the swords of defeated warriors -- but chose not to sit down and put her feet up. Instead, she was offered a small model of the saga's famous seat as a souvenir. It is not clear if Queen Elizabeth or any of the royal family are fans of the award-winning HBO show, which is screened around the world. ""Game of Thrones"" has been filmed in Northern Ireland since 2009, contributing millions of dollars to the local economy during the past five years, providing thousands of jobs, and encouraging tourism to a region once bitterly divided by sectarian violence. Season four of the critically-acclaimed fantasy drama recently concluded in typically gory fashion; fifth and sixth seasons are planned.","Queen Elizabeth II visited ""Game of Thrones"" set in Belfast's Titanic Quarter .

"(CNN) -- Maria Sharapova beat Li Na in three sets to defend her Italian Open title in Rome on Sunday in a bizarre match played in sometimes heavy rain and amid the distraction of football fans gathering nearby. Sharapova was 6-4 4-0 down but fought back to take the match into a deciding tiebreak -- after saving a match point at 6-5 in the third set. By the time the tiebreak came around, the rain was falling heavily, making conditions unplayable, and it even started to rain again when the players returned two hours later to complete the match. Sharapova eventually won it 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (5) and the two players burst out laughing when they shook hands at the net. ""It was a crazy match,"" Sharapova said. ""Either one of us could have won it. There really is no loser."" The men's final between Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal was postponed until Monday because of the weather -- prompting some fans to throw objects onto the court in disgust. Nearby, Napoli and Juventus fans were gathering for the Italian Cup final at the nearby Stadio Olimpico, and the final was punctuated by the sound of fireworks going off and police helicopters flying overhead. ""The match was a joke, it was like playing a football match in the rain,"" said Li, who came close to her first title since winning the French Open almost a year ago. ""Even when we were sent off court, you had to still concentrate for every second, it was tiring for both players. ""You could not relax. It was tense. When we came back out, she was the tougher player. But I take some positives away. It's getting close to Roland Garros and I think I hit the ball well. I also moved her around the court well."" Sharapova heads to Roland Garros with a second clay-court title of the year under her belt. Not traditionally a threat on the slow surface, the world No. 2 has only lost once on clay in 2012 -- to Serena Williams. ""This is a great win for me going into Roland Garros,"" Sharapova said.

"(CNN) -- Petra Kvitova made a convincing start to her bid for back-to-back grand slams with the loss of just one game in seeing off Kristina Mladenovic of France Tuesday at Flushing Meadows. The Wimbledon champion has come into the U.S. Open after a morale boosting victory in the preceding New Haven tournament and again looked impressive. The third-seeded Czech broke her 73rd-ranked opponent five times in a one-sided contest to earn a second round clash with compatriot Petra Cetkovska. But there was a upset defeat for Australian Open finalist Dominika Cibulkova, who was stunned by 15-year-old American Catherine Bellis 6-1 4-6 6-4. Bellis becomes the youngest winner at the U.S. Open since Anna Kournikova in 1996 as she beat the 12th seed, who has endured a miserable summer on the hard courts. Other seeds fared better led by by seventh ranked Eugenie Bouchard of Canada, beaten by Kvitova in the Wimbledon final. Bouchard has struggled since her heroics at SW19, but eased past Olga Govortsova of Belarus on the Louis Armstrong court with a 6-2 6-1 victory. Govortsov had three break points at 2-2 in the first set but could not convert and won just a single game thereafter. Bouchard hit 19 winners overall and few unforced errors to get another grand slam campaign rolling. ""I'm happy to get a match under my belt and want to keep it rolling this week,"" said Bouchard. ""I love playing the grand slams and just want to raise my level at the biggest stages and the biggest matches,"" she told the official U.S. Open website. Former world number one Ana Ivanovic, seeded eighth, opened her campaign with a 6-3 6-0 win over American Alison Riske.

"(CNN) -- For Titanic enthusiasts, it's a last chance to glimpse the famous cruise liner in its final resting place, a full 100 years after the vessel's tragic demise. A series of expeditions by marine dive specialists Deep Ocean Expeditions (DOE) will take paying tourists to the wreck site 12,000 feet below the surface of the North Atlantic Ocean in early July. The British company has been running Titanic tours since 1998 but expedition leader Rob McCallum says the forthcoming trips will likely be their last. There are currently no other organizations that offer commercial forays to the Titanic, meaning this summer's voyages could also be the last to cater to the paying public. ""We actually finished the Titanic dives in 2005 but it's the centenary year and we had so many requests to make the trip that we decided to do it one more time,"" says McCallum. ""Now that the last survivor has passed I just think it's time to move on ... we've been to Titanic 197 times and it's time to do other things,"" he adds. See also: Deep sea tourism, voyage to the bottom of the sea . Three separate Deep Ocean Expedition (DOE) trips are already fully booked to set sail from Saint Johns, Newfoundland, catering to 20 paying guests a time and lasting for 12 days each. It will take a day and a half sailing time to reach the dive site and once there lectures will be given to prepare divers for the rigors of the deep sea. A Mir submersible chartered from the Russian Academy of Sciences -- one of the only vehicles sturdy and technologically advanced enough to reach such depths -- will then make a series of visits to the wreck site. ""Dives take between 10 and 12 hours to complete,"" says McCallum. ""It takes two hours to get down and two hours to get back. That gives (at least) six hours down on the wreck looking around,"" he adds. See also: Did the moon sink the Titanic? Divers are able explore the outer regions of both the bow and stern sections of the fractured vessel -- which are situated three quarters of a mile apart on the ocean floor -- as well as peer into the ship's inner sanctum, says McCallum. ""It is an emotional experience,"" he says describing the sight of the Titanic first coming into view. ""It is just such a big vessel. There is something about Titanic in terms of her majesty and her grace. She was the pinnacle of human engineering achievement at that time,"" he adds. See also: 100 years later, Titanic's allure still strong . Although heavily involved in organizing and planning the trip for DOE, McCallum has only ever been able to take the plunge to the Titanic once. At a cost of $59,000 per person, doing so makes the experience ""a once in a lifetime"" adventure for most, he says. Yet despite the hefty price tag, it is not just the super wealthy who are keen to climb aboard, adds McCallum. He explains that there are just as many people on middle incomes, who are enthusiasts or have a historic link to the ship, that save up for years so they can make the journey. See also: The Titanic up for auction . ""They are driven by a passion,"" says McCallum. ""Sometimes it's a link to Titanic, to relationships with someone that was on board or in the construction or operation of the vessel."" ""Other times there are people of an engineering bent, and occasionally it is not people who are interested in the wreck, they are just interested in getting two and half miles below the surface to see what's there,"" he adds. No matter what the individual reasons may be, almost all who make the trip are humbled by what they experience, says McCallum. For them, ""To actually see the Titanic and to explore it is the culmination of a dream,"" he says. Unless another company comes along with a viable plan to continue the commercial voyages, however, McCallum believes it likely that future generations will be unable to indulge their varying Titanic curiosities first hand. ""If someone wanted to try it, good luck to them,"" McCallum says. ""Unless you are already substantially invested within deep-water explorations, I find it likely that .... it would be too much of a challenge,"" he adds.","A series of dive expeditions will take tourists to the wreck of the Titanic this summer .

My passion for Mars and space exploration began in 1997 when I was 8 years old. NASA had been sending humans to space for several decades, but it began to push new frontiers by sending the first rover to Mars. The Sojourner rover landed on the Red Planet on July 4, 1997, and gave humans a glimpse of the rust-colored Martian surface. Seeing the images ignited a passion inside. For most people, perhaps the desolate landscape of Mars is uninviting; for me, it was the future -- the next frontier. I remember telling myself then that the only way we will find the answers locked inside our solar system would be to send humans to Mars; and I wanted to go. When I was a senior in college, I was selected to be the executive officer and chief geologist of Crew 99 at the Mars Desert Research Station in Utah. Much like the astronauts on the International Space Station learn to live and work in space, the Mars Society's MDRS outpost teaches us how to live, work and solve problems on Mars. My crew consisted of five other students from across the country and we lived at a Martian analogue station for two weeks. We learned how to conduct daily missions, maintain our habitat, take quick showers and utilize recycled water systems. Although our two-week stay is relatively short compared to Mars One's lifelong expedition, it is scientific research like this that is going to help us find a way to adapt to living on other planets. Once the Mars One crew arrives on Mars the members will begin living their lives as Martians. A majority of their time will be spent conducting scientific experiments, exploring the surroundings, maintaining and improving their habitat. They will also stay connected with the world they left through e-mail and video messages. They will live like the scientists at MDRS and spend their days learning how to adapt to a foreign environment. The opportunity the Mars One project presents is extraordinary. Humans have always dreamed of living on another planet. The technology to send us to the surface of a planet like Mars exists; it has been available for more than 20 years. But limited funding and unknown health risks have put a brake on our desire to try to settle on other planets. 200,000 apply to live on Mars . Because Mars mysteriously lost its atmosphere and oceans millions of years ago it is important for us to find out why. By sending humans there, we can find answers to Mars' past and future, and ultimately, maybe find answers to the future of Earth. Of course, there are concerns about whether it makes sense to start a human settlement on such a cold and harsh planet. In an article in The Times, astronauts and physicians acknowledge that the human body isn't equipped for long-term space travel. Risks include extended exposure to radiation and cosmic rays. Even at low and acceptable levels, they may cause health problems. Luckily, it does not take a lifetime to travel to Mars. In fact, it may only take 210 days to reach the Red Planet. This is a mere 30 days longer than a normal crew rotation on the International Space Station. While we know about the negative toll of prolonged space living on the human body, astronauts returning to the gravitational force of the Earth recover from their stay in space. Although research is still being done on the loss of bone mass, most other effects felt during space missions subside after physical therapy and treatment. Mars is also a much smaller planet than Earth. This means the gravity felt on the surface is one-third what we feel on Earth. Once the settlers arrive on the surface after a seven-month space journey, their bodies will eventually adapt to the surface of Mars. Obviously, there will be unforeseen challenges in such a huge endeavor. But they shouldn't deter us from the attempt. If we never put our collective efforts together to do this, the human race will never fulfill its dream of living on another planet. We owe it to future generations, who will be left with the problems of Earth, to try to find new homes throughout the solar system. As long as there are volunteers like me willing to make the sacrifice, we will find ways to survive in space and beyond. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Heidi Beemer.","Mars One, a nonprofit, aims to establish the first human settlement on the Red Planet .

"New York (CNN) -- A 13th-century painting that was up for auction by Sotheby's is now in the hands of the U.S. government after it was determined to have allegedly been stolen from a safe deposit box in Switzerland in 1986, according to court documents. Sotheby's listed ""Madonna and Child,"" an oil-on-panel painting, for sale in January and estimated the painting would bring between $600,000 and $800,000, according to Sotheby's spokesperson Dan Abernethy. Shortly after the listing, Sotheby's performed its regular background check on the piece and discovered that it was in a database of stolen art, according to a Sotheby's statement to CNN Wednesday. Sotheby's says it ""immediately and voluntarily"" removed the painting from auction and has ""cooperated fully with the investigation."" The painting is described as being on an engraved background, decorated with gold, dating from about 1285 to 1290. Sotheby's had described it as sharing ""an affinity with models by Duccio di Buoninsegna"" (a painter of that time from the Tuscan city of Siena) but concluded that it was more likely the work of a Florentine painter influenced by Cimabue (a pioneer in the post-Byzantine style who was a contemporary of Duccio), according to documents cited in a forfeiture complaint filed this week in the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office. The artwork is primarily referred to as the ""Duccio painting"" in the complaint. In 1977, according to the complaint, the painting, which at the time was jointly owned by a man and a woman, was deposited in a safe deposit box in Geneva, Switzerland. The woman died in 1980 and her heirs designated another man to represent their interests in the painting. In 1986, the two men moved the painting to a new safety deposit box in another bank branch, according to the complaint. Soon after, one of the co-owners gave a percentage of his ownership to two other men. Those two reported that the co-owner had again moved the artwork, but they did not know the whereabouts of the painting or the co-owner, according to the complaint. An Interpol investigation began in 1991, but the painting was never found until it turned up listed on Sotheby's for auction earlier this year, according to the complaint. Sotheby's would not respond to CNN for comment on how the auction house obtained the artwork. Anyone who claims to have any rights to the painting must appear and show reasons to establish the claim, according to the federal complaint. CNN was unable to contact any parties who once had ownership. No charges have been filed in the alleged theft.","""Madonna and Child"" was listed for auction in January by Sotheby's .

"(CNN) -- Acting on a conservative battle cry and potentially triggering a court battle with the Obama administration, the Republican-led House voted Wednesday to hold former IRS official Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress for refusing to answer questions about her agency's targeting of conservative and other groups. The 231-187 vote fell almost entirely along party lines, a decision that cut across three sharp divides: balance of power issues between the branches of government, political questions over the IRS scandal, and a Constitutional debate over Lerner's individual Fifth Amendment rights. Lerner is in the middle of that trio. Until she retired last year, she ran the IRS division in charge of tax exempt status. An inspector general's report concluded her staff had inappropriately targeted Tea Party and other groups for extra scrutiny. The term ""progressive"" was also flagged but the inspector general report indicated that conservative terms drew more attention from the IRS. The Fifth Amendment question . For nearly a year, Lerner has refused House requests to testify on the matter, citing her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Republicans insist that doesn't apply here, that she waived the right by first asserting her innocence when she appeared before the House Oversight Committee last May. ""Mrs. Lerner made 17 separate factual assertions before invoking her right to remain silent,"" proclaimed Rep. Richard Nugent, Republican of Florida, as he opened up Wednesday's debate. ""You can't make selective assertions and still invoke your Fifth Amendment right."" Lerner's attorney, William Taylor, has dismissed that argument repeatedly and sent a statement rejecting it again Wednesday. ""Today's vote has nothing to do with the facts or the law,"" Taylor wrote. ""Its only purpose is to keep the baseless IRS 'conspiracy' alive through the midterm elections. Ms. Lerner has not committed contempt of Congress. She did not waive her Fifth Amendment rights by proclaiming her innocence."" The politics . As they reject Lerner's Constitutional argument, Republicans see an IRS scandal that remains highly flammable on the right. To conservatives, it is a frightening case of a government agency suppressing political thought from its opponents, mixed with question marks about whether anyone in the White House was involved. ""If we don't hold Lois Lerner accountable for her actions,"" said Rep. Lee Terry, Republican of Nebraska, ""then we're sending a message to future administrations that this type of Nixonian behavior is acceptable."" The problem for Republicans has been that as their base clamors for action and high-ranking heads to roll on the scandal, neither Lerner nor anyone at the IRS has provided information linking the controversy to the White House. As determined as Republicans have been, Democrats have been equally strong in response. ""This is 'sooo' blatantly political,"" Rep. Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts, dragging out his comment for emphasis. ""House Republicans are again playing to the cheap seats with hyperpartisan witch hunts."" McGovern and other Democrats have raised the charge of McCarthyism in the case, arguing that little new information in the IRS scandal has come to light in recent months and accusing Republicans of using the case to distract from other issues. Next: Congress, White House in court? As the politics vibrate, Wednesday's contempt vote set off a specific process in the bureaucratic machine. Now the contempt charge moves to the Justice Department where the U.S. Attorney for Washington must decide whether to prosecute her. If charges are not pursued, House Republican leaders face another choice: Will they file a lawsuit to try and force the Justice Department to take action? It is certainly possible. That is the precise course of events that followed when the House charged Attorney General Eric Holder with contempt in 2012 for refusing to turn over documents in the botched ""Fast and Furious"" gun-running investigation. In that case, Holder and the White House asserted executive privilege. That has not happened yet in the Lerner case. But Republicans are clearly teeing up a battle with the attorney general and President Barack Obama. Immediately following the Lerner contempt vote, the House voted 250-168 to call on Holder to remove the IRS investigation from the Department of Justice and instead appoint a special counsel to look into the scandal.

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Israeli troops have completed their withdrawal from Gaza after a three-week military campaign against Hamas militants, the Israel Defense Forces said Wednesday. Palestinians look at an damaged rocket launcher left behind by Israeli forces. ""The forces are now redeployed outside the Gaza Strip, and are prepared for any development,"" a military statement read. During their withdrawal, Israeli troops warned Gaza residents to avoid unexploded bombs or shells left behind and report their location to Israeli authorities. Israel said it had achieved its goal to halt Hamas' firing of rockets into southern Israel from Gaza. Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that has controlled the territory since 2007, also declared victory in the conflict during a rally in Gaza City on Tuesday. Israeli troops began to withdraw Sunday following tentative, separate cease-fire declarations by Israel Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Hamas. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who visited the territory Tuesday, criticized both sides and the international community for what he called their ""collective political failure"" in settling the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. ""I have condemned from the outbreak of this conflict the excessive use of force by Israeli forces in Gaza. I view the rocket attacks into Israel as completely unacceptable. We need to restore basic respect for civilians,"" he said.  Watch troops prepare to withdraw » . The conflict, which began December 27, has left more than 1,300 Palestinians and 13 Israelis dead. Confirmation of the Israeli withdrawal came within a day of the inauguration of Barack Obama as the new president of the United States, replacing George W. Bush, whose administration was among the most supportive of Israel in decades. Ban said he hoped Obama would consider settling the conflict ""a matter of priority."" Speaking during a visit to Sderot, the southern Israeli city that has endured rocket fire from Hamas for years, Ban said the Bush administration was ""leading and heavily engaged"" in the region, but added, ""Unfortunately, we have not achieved the goals."" Obama has vowed to move swiftly and has said he was assembling a strong team to be ""immediately engaged"" on ""day one."" In a statement welcoming the new U.S. president, Olmert said Israel and the United States would remain ""full partners in advancing peace and stability in the Middle East.""

"(CNN) -- Dave Chappelle wants to clear up a misconception: He never quit ""Chappelle's Show,"" his hit Comedy Central series. ""Technically, I never quit,"" he said in an appearance on ""The Late Show with David Letterman."" ""I'm seven years late for work."" Chappelle's television appearance was a rarity. Since the last episodes of ""Chappelle's Show"" aired in 2006, he's done just a handful of TV interviews, the last with Conan O'Brien in 2008, when O'Brien was still hosting ""Late Night"" on NBC. Chappelle has talked about a variety of reasons for ending the program, including burnout and the inability to devote time to his standup career. He hasn't been a hermit, however. Last year he participated in Funny Or Die's Oddball Comedy & Curiosity Festival, and he also has dropped by comedy clubs to perform. With Letterman, Chappelle -- cracking wise and looking sharp in a gray windowpane suit -- talked about disappearing to South Africa during the height of the controversy about the show's future and the truckloads of money Comedy Central was rumored to have offered him to continue. ""It was like living in the corner of perception and reality. It's a weird place to be,"" he said of the rumors surrounding his Africa trip. Rumors have a way of taking on a life of their own, he added: ""When everyone thought Wesley Snipes was in jail, I saw him at a party."" As for the Comedy Central deal, said to be as high as $50 million? Well, money can't buy everything, Chappelle told Letterman. Sometimes he wonders about the ""what ifs""; other times he's fine with the way things have gone. He said he was at a restaurant with his wife and saw a man across the room. ""He has $100 million, and we're eating the same entree,"" Chappelle told Letterman. Even though he may have less money than the $100 million man, ""the difference in lifestyle is miniscule."" He summed it up, literally.

"(CNN) -- This fall, two student organizations at Duke University met to discuss a simple idea: Put a spotlight on reasons people might take offense to phrases and slurs used in everyday conversation. The result of that conversation -- the ""You Don't Say?"" campaign, a photo project that points out language that marginalizes sexual and gender minorities -- has been sweeping across the Web and the Durham, North Carolina, campus. It comes in the midst of several photo campaigns at colleges around the country. At Harvard, there was the ""I, Too, Am Harvard"" photo project that highlights the experience of its black students. In March at Georgetown, images of administrators in drag explored the issue of gender identity. Duke sophomores Daniel Kort, Anuj Chhabra, Christie Lawrence, and Jay Sullivan co-founded the project. Kort is the president of the undergraduate LGBTQ group Blue Devils United, and Chhabra is the president of Think Before You Talk, a group aimed at bringing awareness to the implications of offensive language. Lawrence and Sullivan serve on Think Before You Talk's executive board. The students explained via e-mail why they got involved, and what they hope the photo campaign will accomplish. Their responses have been edited for clarity. Anuj Chhabra on using the phrase 'That's so gay': . I thought it was important to bring awareness to the implications that these words have because having used some of [these phrases] in high school, I quickly realized how differently other Duke students perceived me [when I commented], ""That's so gay."" One of my friends in particular would constantly question me: ""What do you mean by 'That's so gay?'"" I realized that using the word ""gay"" to describe a teacher who I didn't like or an unfavorable event really didn't make sense, and I began to change the habit. Our intention was to use personal testaments to let people personally challenge themselves, as opposed to ""banning"" these words. Our desire to use the personal ""I"" stems from the fact that most people, after thinking about why it is so common in today's society to equate something like ""dumb"" or ""unfavorable"" with ""gay,"" are quick to change their habits. It is not necessarily homophobic or sexist people using such words and phrases, but largely just ordinary people. Daniel Kort on why he participated: . Throughout elementary and middle school, I was consistently bullied by my classmates because of characteristics that others deemed ""gay."" I was constantly called ""fag"" and ""bitch."" At times, it felt as if my entire class was against me, and I can recall only one instance that somebody stood up for me. I would cry to my mom during the car ride home, and my schoolwork and motivation suffered. With help from the school counselor, I was eventually able to stand up for myself and disregard my bullies. In my first year [at Duke], I was called a ""fag"" by one of my hall mates in the first month of school. I was lucky to have my friends there to intervene, but I know that not all students are as fortunate. I was motivated by the bystanders who were there for me that night, and this experience propelled my enthusiasm to work on the campaign. Though I don't have the same reaction nowadays in response to these words, I stand in solidarity with younger students who are marginalized by their classmates. Christie Lawrence on how these terms impact her and others: . All of these phrases impact me, whether they directly address me or not. I think it is important to try to be as good of a person as you can, and through conversations with my friends, I have grown to recognize the hurt these words can inflict. Even if I am not gay, I know that calling someone a ""fag"" or qualifying an expression of admiration with ""no homo"" attaches hurtful connotations to words that are directly connected to a certain identity. Telling me to ""man up"" or not be a ""pussy"" tells me that you believe women are weaker, more emotional and lesser than a man. It tells me that you think a certain way to act is the right way and anything that does not fall under the umbrella of ""acceptable"" behavior or emotions is something to be put down. This attitude, that there is a correct way to have courage, be successful, or achieve happiness, is something that I believe hurts everyone in our society, including myself. This campaign is not an attempt to ban words or invalidate someone's right to free speech, but instead is an attempt to show how these words are hurtful for many. One comment on an article I read about our campaign explained it very nicely: You have the right to say these offensive phrases, but we also have the right to tell you why we think these phrases are hurtful. Jay Sullivan on how language reflects values: . I am a Christian. That is the lens I bring to all the work that I do in the community here at Duke, in the local Durham community, and in my daily life. When I was in high school, I was the leader of the my school's small Christian Fellowship. I went to a private co-ed prep school in New Haven, Connecticut, called Hopkins School, and I distinctly remember during my junior year during the day of silence I was wearing an ally sticker in support of my friends who were silent. In class that day, an older friend came up to me and said, '""Look, Jay, I respect you but you need to take that ally sticker off man. You're condoning their sinful actions. You can't support them and be the leader of a Christian organization."" I was quite taken aback, and after a short dialogue I took off the sticker to avoid any further conflict. That experience bothered me for a while, that I didn't take a stand to tell him, ""People are people and they deserve the same rights and freedom to live the way they want that you have, as well. God loves everyone regardless of any part of their identity that you may have deemed sinful or unworthy."" This campaign is not about language; it is about what this language represents. The way we talk is a reflection of our beliefs and perceptions of the world and it is vital, at least for me, to examine whether what I say is in line with my values and how I view the world.","Duke students created a campaign to point out language that marginalizes others .

"(CNN) -- The St. Louis Rams announced Saturday that Michael Sam, who made history as the first openly gay player to be drafted into the NFL, has been waived and did not make the team's final 53-man roster. Sam, an All-American defensive end who played for the University of Missouri, made history when he was picked by the Rams in the seventh and final round. He was the 249th of 256 players selected. The Rams' move does not necessarily mean the end of Sam's professional career. He could still be picked up by another team, possibly on waivers, or return to the Rams as a player on the practice squad, coach Jeff Fisher said. At a press conference, Fisher said releasing Sam was ""a football decision. It was a football decision back in May when we drafted Mike."" Sam said on Twitter @MichaelSamNFL: . ""I want to thank the entire Rams organization and the city of St. Louis for giving me this tremendous opportunity and allowing me to show I can play at this level. I look forward to continuing to build on the progress I made here toward a long and successful career."" Another Tweet read: ""The most worthwhile things in life rarely come easy, this is a lesson I've always known. The journey continues."" Fisher said Sam has the ability play somewhere. ""It needs to be the right place and a good fit."" Sam, at 6-foot-2 and 260 pounds, starred in college football last season. Besides being first team All-American, he was named the top defensive player in the Southeastern Conference, considered the nation's best league. Teammates named him the team's most valuable player. On Saturday, Sam returned to his college in Columbia, Missouri, to be honored at the game against South Dakota State. Obama congratulates Michael Sam . Fisher said Sam worked hard, but the team already had a lot of strong defensive ends. ""Mike fit in very, very well"" at training camp, Fisher said. ""He was fun to be around and he was a good teammate."" Bleacher Report said the contracts of players on waivers can be picked up by other teams within 48 hours. If the contracts are not picked up, the players can become unrestricted free agents. Teams, including the Rams, could put Sams on their practice squads. Sam worked with the second and third units during the preseason and made 11 tackles and recorded three sacks, said Bleacher Report. Sam told his college teammates he was gay and made a public announcement shortly before the NFL draft in May. When he was drafted, he made waves kissing his boyfriend in celebration as cameras looked on. Sam sets out to make it in the NFL . Being drafted was historic and Sam received a congratulatory phone call from President Barack Obama. ""I'm determined to be great,"" Sam told reporters after the draft. ""So I'm going to train hard and try to make the team."" Fisher said the talked one-one-one with all the players who were released except Sam. He said he will talk to him in person Sunday. Other athletes have come out as gay, but they didn't have Sam's profile. Among them are the NBA's Jason Collins, the WNBA's Brittney Griner, WWE's Darren Young, UFC's Liz Carmouche, MMA's Fallon Fox and Major League Soccer's Robbie Rogers. The road to football stardom was not an easy one for Sam. One of eight children, he grew up in Hitchcock, Texas, where he was raised primarily by his mother. At one point, he has said, he lived out of his mother's car and briefly stayed with another family. Three of Sam's siblings have died, including an older brother he saw die from a gunshot wound. Two of his brothers are serving prison sentences. Champ Bailey released by the New Orleans Saints . Drew Iden of CNN contributed to this report.","Michael Sam tweets: ""The journey continues""

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- A Japanese coast guard crew member has confessed to leaking a video of a boat collision that sparked a recent diplomatic battle between China and Japan, officials said Wednesday. It was unclear whether the crew member would be arrested for putting the video online, police said. The video, posted on YouTube, shows what is thought to be the Chinese fishing trawler ramming into a ship, thought to be a Japanese coast guard vessel. The crash video had not been released to the public and Japanese lawmakers were alarmed that it had been on the video-sharing website. ""The fact that the video was leaked is a big mistake for the government,"" Hiroshi Kawauchi, a legislator of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan, said last week. ""It is totally different from presenting it to the public in an official manner, and it leads the people's further erosion of faith in Japan's government."" The September incident sparked a diplomatic squabble between the two nations. After the collision, Japan detained the crew of the Chinese fishing boat off the disputed islands in the East China Sea. China calls the islands the Diaoyu; Japan calls them the Senkaku. In response to the detainments, China made increasingly aggressive diplomatic threats. Beijing also halted ministerial-level talks with Tokyo, and both sides canceled trips to each other's nations. Japan has since released the fishing crew, which China says was stopped illegally. Japan initially accused the captain of obstructing Japanese public officers while they performed duties. But authorities later said that releasing him was in the interest of maintaining relations with China. Though the leaking of the video has alarmed Japanese officials, officials in China have questioned its accuracy. Some in the Chinese government dismissed the video saying it had been edited. CNN's Kyung Lah contributed to this report.","Video shows boat collision that started a diplomatic row between China and Japan .

"ANKARA, Turkey (CNN) -- Turkey excluded Israel from a planned NATO military exercise, partly because of Ankara's criticism of Israel's Gaza offensive nearly a year ago, Turkey's foreign minister told CNN Sunday in an exclusive interview. Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu says, ""We hope that the situation in Gaza will be improved."" The Turkish government decided to change the list of participating countries and exclude Israel, according to the Israel Defense Forces. As a result, the NATO exercise was effectively scrapped, although a U.S. embassy representative said it was only postponed. Asked why Turkey excluded Israel from the exercise, Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said, ""We hope that the situation in Gaza will be improved, that the situation will be back to the diplomatic track. And that will create a new atmosphere in Turkish-Israeli relations as well. But in the existing situation, of course, we are criticizing this approach, [the] Israeli approach."" Earlier, the Turkish foreign ministry said ""a technical matter,"" not politics, prompted the delay of the Anatolian Eagle exercise. Instead of the NATO exercise, Davutoglu said Turkey would be conducting ""a national military exercise now after consultations with all the parties involved."" The United States and Italy -- which, along with Turkey, are members of NATO -- were scheduled to take part in the exercise. Both countries withdrew their participation from the drill after learning Israel had been excluded, according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, citing foreign ministry sources. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Ankara would say only that the United States and its allies postponed the exercise ""in hopes of re-scheduling it."" ""We look at this as a postponement, not a cancellation,"" said embassy spokeswoman Deborah Guido. Turkey is Israel's Muslim ally in the Middle East, and the two nations have enjoyed close military and economic relations over the last decade. But tensions have emerged over strong Turkish criticism of the Gaza offensive in December and January. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan stormed out of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January after accusing Israeli President Shimon Peres of killing children during the six-week war. The Anatolian Eagle exercise is held every few years to boost international aerial cooperation. It was to run from October 12-23. CNN's Ivan Watson contributed to this report.","Israel excluded from Anatolian Eagle military exercise .

"(CNN) -- A Florida cardiologist could have his medical license revoked by state authorities who have accused him of performing illegal stem cell therapy on a patient who died during the procedure. Florida's Department of Health ordered the emergency suspension of Zannos Grekos' medical license Wednesday, accusing the Bonita Springs doctor of violating an emergency order against using stem cell treatments in Florida and causing the death of an unidentified elderly patient. Grekos can appeal the order. According to the license suspension order, Grekos performed a stem cell treatment this month on the patient, who was suffering from pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis. Both diseases restrict blood flow to the heart. ""During said stem cell treatment, patient R.P. suffered a cardiac arrest and died,"" the suspension order said. CNN first investigated Grekos' activities in 2009, when he said he was using stem cell therapy for a company called Regenocyte Therapeutic. His profile, listed on the company's website, describes Grekos as having ""extensive experience in the field of stem cell therapy"" and says he ""was recently appointed to the Science Advisory Board of the United States' Repair Stem Cell Institute."" At the time of CNN's interview, Grekos said he extracted stem cells from patients and then sent the blood to Israel for laboratory processing. That processing, he said, resulted in ""regenocytes,"" which he said would help heal crippling diseases, mostly associated with lung problems. Watch CNN's 2009 report on Grekos . The president of the International Society of Stem Cell Research, Dr. Irving Weissman, told CNN at the time that ""there is no such cell."" ""There is nothing called a regenocyte,"" he said. After CNN's initial report, Grekos said the name was ""advertising"" and was not intended to be scientific. Officials from the Florida Department of Health told CNN they had been seeking to revoke Grekos' license through an administrative hearing process. That hearing, originally scheduled for this month, was pushed back until June because Grekos had changed attorneys. In February 2011, Florida officials imposed an emergency restriction order that prevented Grekos from using stem cells in any treatment after he allegedly performed stem cell therapy on a 69-year-old woman, who later died, according to state health officials. ""By such action, Dr. Grekos has demonstrated a disconcerting disregard for the duties and responsibilities imposed upon a physician practicing in the State of Florida and for the health and welfare of his patients and the citizens of Florida,"" states the suspension order, dated Wednesday. In a statement issued by his publicist, Stanton Smith, Grekos said about patient R.P., ""My family and I are deeply saddened by this devastating loss."" Smith said recent news coverage regarding the incident had been inaccurate. In a news release, he said Grekos ""has not performed any 'illegal stem cell therapy.'"" ""An official investigation is under way and we are fully cooperating with all authorities,"" Grekos says in the news release.

"JERUSALEM (CNN)  -- Israel has declared a unilateral cease-fire in the fighting in Gaza beginning at 2 a.m. Sunday (7 p.m. ET Saturday), Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said. A man escapes after an Israeli strike in Beit Lahia in northern Gaza on Saturday. ""Hamas has been dealt a very serious blow,"" Olmert said. ""We can say that the conditions have been brought about that enable us to say that the aims that we laid down for the operation have been completely achieved."" Yet Israel is prepared to respond if Hamas militants continue fighting in the Palestinian territory, Olmert said. ""If foes decide to continue to fight against us, then we will be ready and we shall consider ourselves justified in replying,"" he said. ""I do not suggest that Hamas or other terrorist organizations try us."" Immediate Palestinian response to Olmert's announcement was pessimistic. Saeb Erakat, the chief Palestinian negotiator involved in diplomatic talks on the conflict, noted that Olmert did not say Israeli troops would be leaving Gaza. ""I'm afraid this means the cease-fire will not stand; it will break,"" Erakat told CNN International. ""Anybody can fire a shot now. ... It's a very fragile moment."" The announcement followed a Cabinet meeting Saturday meant to vote on the basics of a plan that could end fighting in Gaza. It also came a day after Israeli and U.S. diplomats signed an agreement designed to stop arms smuggling into the Palestinian territory through tunnels. Israel launched the offensive in Gaza three weeks ago with the stated intent of stopping rocket fire into southern Israel from Hamas fighters in Gaza. There is mounting international pressure to end the fighting. In a televised speech Saturday, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak called on Israel to end military operations and withdraw from Gaza. He dismissed the idea of an international force based in Egypt, saying he would ""never accept"" a foreign presence on Egyptian soil. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also reiterated his call for a cease-fire during a speech before the Lebanese parliament Saturday. ""The level of violence in Gaza is unprecedented,"" the U.N. chief said. ""The Israeli aerial and land offensives against Hamas targets are inflicting heavy civilian casualties, widespread destruction and tremendous suffering for the entire region.""  Watch opinions from the iReport community » . The three-week conflict has killed 1,203 people in Gaza and injured more than 5,000 more, many of them Palestinian civilians, according to medical sources in Gaza City. They said 410 children have died. On the Israeli side, 10 soldiers and three civilians have been killed and more than 200 soldiers have been wounded since the fighting began, an Israel Defense Forces spokesman said Saturday. Fighting continued as the IDF attacked 50 targets between Friday night and Saturday morning, including eight missile-launching sites and 70 tunnels along the Egyptian border. The IDF says the tunnels were being used by Hamas to smuggle weapons into Gaza. Two children were killed in an Israeli artillery attack at a U.N. school north of Gaza City early Saturday. ""This yet again illustrates that there is no place safe in the Gaza Strip,"" said Chris Gunness, a U.N. spokesman, speaking of the attack. ""This fighting has to stop, because innocent people, women and children, who are taking refuge in neutral U.N. buildings are discovering that there is nowhere safe.""  Watch a report on aid shortages to Gaza » . Four IDF soldiers were seriously wounded early Saturday by mortar fire in Gaza, according to an IDF statement. Hamas has said a cease-fire alone is not enough. ""We are working in every direction so we can achieve our objectives in stopping the aggression, lifting the blockade, opening the crossings, and the compensation of our people and the rebuilding of the Gaza strip,"" said Hamas delegation spokesman Salah Bardwill. In other diplomatic efforts, the state of Qatar held an emergency summit Friday in an attempt to find a unified Arab voice on Gaza. The meeting brought together several Arab and Muslim leaders, including the presidents of Iran and Syria and the leader of Hamas, Khaled Meshaal. Friday evening, the U.N. General Assembly voted 142-4 to call on Israel to abide by a January 8 resolution by the U.N. Security Council. The resolution, which called for an immediate cease-fire by both sides in the conflict, had been universally ignored. Israel and the United States were among the countries voting against Friday's effort.

"(CNN) -- A jihadist website is urging its American followers to kill comedian David Letterman, saying his tongue deserves to be cut over his remarks about a terror leader, an online intelligence group said. The writer posted the death threat after he got upset by a Letterman joke about an al Qaeda leader killed in Pakistan, according to SITE intelligence group, which monitors and translates online terror activity. Ilyas Kashmiri, described as al Qaeda's ""military brain,"" died in a drone strike in June, his jihadist group said at the time. Letterman cracked jokes about the killing, and dragged his finger across his neck to show ""the way of the slaughter,""  the message on the jihadist site said. He then said Kashmiri joins terror leader Osama bin Laden, who was killed in Pakistan in May, according to the message posted Wednesday. ""This despicable person mocked the leaders of the mujahideen,"" the post says. The death threat urges jihadist followers to cut off Letterman's tongue and ""shut it forever."" CNN could not independently confirm the message. A spokesman for the FBI said the agency is looking into the death threats. ""In the post 9/11 world, we take all of these threats seriously,"" spokesman Peter Donald said. A federal law enforcement official said such threats are common. ""We see these kinds of threats frequently against people in business and media. Usually nothing comes of them, but we check them all out,"" the official said. CBS's publicity department for ""Late Show With David Letterman"" declined to comment Thursday on the issue. But on the show's official Facebook page, the comedian's fans rallied to his defense. ""Keep doing what you do Dave,"" wrote Ronnie W., one of Letterman's supporters. ""Dont let Al Quaeda influence your comedy, but Inspire it .... we got your back."" Steve Grand, director of the Brookings Institution's U.S. Relations with the Islamic World project, said that jihadists closely track U.S. culture -- as seen in seized videos showing the late Osama bin Laden watching western news programs. He said there's a sense U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, a prominent member in al Qaeda, may be looking to ""find ways of entering the American discourse."" ""There's an obsession with the United States and the West, more generally,"" said Grand. ""And there is a desire to defend their cause through violence."" The internet serves as a motivational resource for jihadists used ""to inspire offshoots and to encourage like-minded people,"" the Brookings' fellow added. As such, a specific threat -- like the one targeting Letterman -- could be viewed as encouraging others to act. Yet Grand, like the federal law enforcement official, notes that dozens of such threats are made monthly. What may be more significant is how the American public reacts. ""(U.S. citizens) have gotten use to this kind of talk, and there's sort of a resilience,"" he said. ""What is most invaluable in the United States is that the best tool against terrorism is resilience, ... to not be cowed by threats and get back to your lives.""

"GAZA CITY, Gaza (CNN) -- Palestinian militants declared Sunday that they would stop attacks on Israel for a week, a statement that came hours after Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert announced a unilateral cease-fire in the country's assault on Hamas in Gaza. An Israeli soldier holds up an Israeli flag after leaving Gaza on Sunday. The Palestinians demanded that Israel remove all troops from Gaza within the week, Hamas spokesman Ayman Taha said from Egypt. The agreement appears to cover all Palestinian armed factions, not only Hamas. ""We in the Palestinian resistance movements announce a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip,"" Moussa Abu Marzouk, a senior Hamas official in Syria, said on Syrian TV. ""And we demand that Israeli forces withdraw in one week and that they open all the border crossings to permit the entry of humanitarian aid and basic goods for our people in Gaza."" There is no mutual agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians -- each side has made its own unilateral declaration of a cease-fire. Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, called for the cease-fire to hold so aid could get into Gaza.  Watch how a family in Gaza is coping with the violence » . ""We hope that it continues and that the situation calms down and that humanitarian aid delivery begins immediately to our people,"" he said at a summit in Egypt.

The Palestinians and Israel continued to skirmish for several hours Sunday after Israel said it was stopping its offensive against Hamas. Palestinians fired at least 19 rockets into Israel on Sunday -- including at least two after the Palestinian cease-fire declaration, according to Israeli police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld. At least three people were lightly wounded. Israeli military aircraft retaliated, firing missiles and destroying a rocket launcher, a military spokesman said. Shortly before the rocket attacks, Palestinian gunmen opened fire on Israeli forces in northern Gaza, the military said. Troops returned fire. Separately, Palestinian medical sources said 23 bodies were pulled from rubble in Gaza.    Watch doctors tend to wounded civilians » . Olmert said Sunday the Israeli offensive had achieved its goals but that the Israel Defense Forces reserved the right to respond to any Palestinian violence against Israelis. ""IDF forces are in the Gaza Strip and many other units, which are surrounding Gaza from all sides, are closely observing every corner and listening to every whisper, ready for any response that they might receive from their commanders if and when the violations continue, as they have this morning,"" he said at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting, before the announcement of the Palestinian cease-fire. Israel pulled some troops out of the Palestinian territory as it called a halt to its operation against Hamas, but others remained. Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev told CNN they would be there for a matter of days, not weeks. International leaders are in the region for talks on the crisis. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and French President Nicolas Sarkozy hosted a summit Sunday in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, bringing together leaders from Europe and the Middle East. Olmert told the gathering that, if the cease-fire holds, ""the government of Israel has no intention to stay in the Gaza Strip. We are interested in leaving Gaza as soon as we can."" He said Israel would ""continue to do whatever is possible to prevent the humanitarian crisis in Gaza,"" and expressed sorrow for the deaths of innocent civilians. ""It wasn't our intention to fight them or to harm them, to hurt them or to shoot at them,"" he said. German Premier Angela Merkel underscored the international community's preferred outcome in a news conference in Egypt: ""The two-state solution is the only solution we have."" Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert will meet the leaders of the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the Czech Republic, which  holds the rotating presidency of the European Union, later in Jerusalem. A top aide to Barack Obama said the president-elect would move swiftly to work on the Middle East after he is sworn in on Tuesday. ""The events around the world demand that he act quickly, and I think you'll see him act quickly,"" David Axelrod told CNN. But he refused to promise Obama would name a Middle East special envoy ""on day one."" Israel said it launched the offensive in Gaza to stop the firing of rockets -- primarily the short-range homemade Qassam rockets -- from the territory into southern Israel by Hamas fighters. ""We welcome any alleviation of violence, with cautious optimism and hope that these declarations of cease-fire will lead to the end of fighting,"" said Charles Clayton, national director of World Vision Jerusalem, an aid group. ""We call on all parties to stop attacks, including Hamas' rocket strikes against Israel, and refrain from further hostilities."" He called for ""unhindered and safe humanitarian assistance to the desperate civilian families of Gaza who have lost their homes and businesses and are struggling amid shortages of food, supplies, healthcare and fuel."" He further called for an end ""to the 18-month blockade of the 1.5 million Palestinians in Gaza,"" saying it has ""devastated the economy, halted services, and rendered the people of Gaza entirely dependent on humanitarian aid.""

"Jindo, South Korea (CNN) -- A South Korean captain, standing in handcuffs before reporters, defended his order to delay the evacuation of his sinking ferry, CNN affiliate YTN reported early Saturday. The news of Lee Joon Seok's arrest in connection with the sinking that left at least 29 people dead and more than 270 missing came as divers made their way to the third deck inside the wreckage where they found three bodies, according to the South Korean coast guard. The divers weren't able to recover the three bodies from a compartment, the coast guard said. Another 40 dives are planned for Saturday in an attempt to get inside the ferry, the coast guards' Koh Myung Seok told reporters. Lee has been charged with abandoning his boat, negligence, causing bodily injury, not seeking rescue from other ships, and violating ""seamen's law,"" state media reported, citing prosecutors and police . The charges against Lee appear to shed some light on what authorities have focused on in their efforts to find out what happened to the ferry making its way Wednesday from Incheon to the resort island of Jeju. It sank in frigid waters 20 kilometers (roughly 12 miles) off the coast of South Korea's southern peninsula. ""Mr. Lee is charged with causing the Sewol ship to sink by failing to slow down while sailing the narrow route and making (a) turn excessively,"" prosecutor Lee Bong-chang told the semi-official Yonhap news agency. ""Lee is also charged with failing to do the right thing to guide the passengers to escape and thereby leading to their death or injury."" If convicted, Lee faces from five years to life in prison. A South Korean prosecutor said Lee wasn't at the helm of the Sewol when it started to sink; a third mate was at the helm. Where was captain? ""It is not clear where he was when the accident occurred, although it is clear that he was not in the steering room before the actual accident happened,"" state prosecutor Jae-Eok Park said. A crew member, described as the third mate, appeared with Lee and, like the captain, the third mate was in handcuffs. The man was identified only as Park. It was unclear if he was one of two other crew members who authorities have said also faced arrest in connection with the sinking. A spokesman for the joint prosecutor and police investigators declined to provide further details. As the captain left a court hearing early Saturday, police led him to reporters, where he answered questions. ""The tidal current was strong and water temperature was cold, and there was no rescue boat,"" Lee told reporters, according to CNN affiliate YTN. ""So I had everyone stand by and wait for the rescue boat to arrive."" Lee acknowledged that he plotted the ship's course, and then went to his cabin briefly ""to tend to something."" It was then, he said, the accident happened. The third mate, who was at the helm of the ship when Lee left, said he did not make a sharp turn. Rather, he said, ""the steering turned much more than usual."" The captain was one of at least 174 people rescued soon after the Sewol began to sink, violating an ""age-old rule and internationally recognized rule that a captain must stay on the vessel,"" maritime law attorney Jack Hickey said. ""Pretty much every law, rule, regulation and standard throughout the world says that yes, the captain must stay with the ship until all personnel are safely off of the ship, certainly passengers."" Scores of ships on water, divers plunge below it . Hopes of finding the missing alive dimmed further when the entire boat became submerged Friday. Until then, part of the ship's blue-and-white hull was still poking out of the frigid waters of the Yellow Sea. The coast guard said workers continued to pump air into the hull of the submerged ship but could not stop its descent. Still, divers breached the hull of the sunken ferry, and two managed to enter the second deck -- the cargo deck, the South Korean coast guard said. But rough waters forced them out. They didn't find any bodies in their brief search. The effort was still underway in earnest Saturday morning featuring helicopters circling above the water and about 120 vessels -- from large warships to fishing ships to dinghies -- in the water, in addition to the divers under it. Four cranes also sit about 500 yards from the focal point, ready to lift the ferry if and when the order comes in. That hasn't happened yet, though, with authorities not yet giving up on finding survivors. Compounding the tragedy, one of those rescued -- a high school vice principal who was on board the ferry along with more than 300 students -- was found hanging from a tree, police said. Kang Min Kyu, 52, vice principal of Ansan Danwon High School, was among the first survivors to be rescued. Police said he apparently hanged himself, using a belt, from a tree near a gymnasium in Jindo, where distraught relatives of missing passengers have been camping. Police confirmed a suicide note was found, but declined to release its contents. Anger and disgust . Relatives of passengers expressed increasing disgust and anger about the lack of explanation from the captain and the pace of the rescue effort. Some have waited for days in the cold rain at a harbor in Jindo. Others camped at a nearby gymnasium and auditorium, desperate to hear any news of their loved ones. Relatives overcome with emotion howled and screamed, but to no avail. ""Hurry up, find it faster!"" one woman wailed. Any hope for survival largely hinges on whether passengers may be in air pockets within the ship, which isn't unheard of in such cases. In May 2013, a tugboat capsized off West Africa. Rescuers pulled out a man from 100 feet below the surface who survived 2Â½ days inside a 4-square-foot air pocket. That's one reason family members aren't ready to give up hope. Part of the frustration stems from the conflicting information reported by officials. In the hours after the sinking, some analysts speculated the ferry may have veered off course and struck an object. But the South Korean Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries said Thursday that it had approved the boat's intended route, and the actual course did not deviate significantly. But Kim Soo Hyeon, chief of South Korea's Yellow Sea Maritime Police Agency, later said the ship apparently deviated from its planned route but did not appear to have hit a rock. 'Ship is tilted' The Ministry of Ocean and Fisheries released a transcript of the conversation between the ferry and center that monitors vessel traffic. After alerting the center that the ferry was rolling, the Sewol stated that ""the body of the ship is tilted to the left. Containers fell over, too."" The control center then asked if people were hurt. Impossible to confirm because it was impossible to move, the ferry responded. The center told the ferry crew to get people ready for evacuation, and the ferry once again described how hard it was for people to move. Adding to the pain for families, police said texts and social media messages claiming to be from missing passengers turned out to be fake. Media outlets, including CNN, shared the texts with a wide audience. ""We will investigate people sending out these messages,"" said Lee Sung Yoon, head of the combined police and prosecution team. He said authorities will go after those behind the hoaxes and will ""punish them severely.""

"(CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel broke another Formula One world record Tuesday and he didn't even have to climb into a car to do it. A race helmet worn by the four-time world champion has set a new world record price at a charity auction in London. An intense bidding war surrounded the helmet, which featured a glittering gold design, at Bonhams auctioneers. The successful bidder eventually paid $118,000 for the helmet which was worn by Vettel on his way to victory in this year's German Grand Prix. The figure topped the previous world record price of $116,189 paid for a helmet which belonged to Brazil's late three-time champion Ayrton Senna. The funds raised by Vettel's helmet will go directly to the Wings for Life charity set up by Red Bull Racing owner Dietrich Mateschitz. The charity focuses on research into spinal cord injuries. ""This is one of my favorite helmet designs from this season and it goes without saying that this was one of the most special races for me -- my first ever home win,"" Vettel told Red Bull's official website. ""Just as the race meant a lot to me, Wings for Life does too and it's my pleasure to donate this signed and worn helmet."" A pair of helmets worn by retired Red Bull racer Mark Webber in his final season in F1 also added to the charity's prize pot.

"(CNN) -- Several diplomatic facilities were shuttered Friday as many brace for intensified protests over the anti-Islam movie ""Innocence of Muslims,"" as well as recently published cartoons in a French publication of a figure resembling the Prophet Mohammed. Demonstrations have raged for days as many in the Muslim world are angry about the U.S.-made Prophet Mohammed mocking film and the French cartoon. And some believe Friday prayers, a time of protest recently in the Middle East and North Africa, could add fuel to the fire. Demonstrations occurred in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran Thursday. The developments include: . Protesters set blaze in Pakistan . Protesters in Peshawar, Pakistan torched two movie theaters in the city Friday morning, in protest against the film and the cartoon, a fire official said. Firefighters were able to extinguish one blaze in about 90 minutes but were not able to get to the other fire, said Nadir Shah, a fire brigade official. ""We were informed by the police that the two cinemas had been set ablaze by rioters and so we responded immediately,"" said Shah. There were also protests reported in Rawalpindi and Karachi, CNN affiliate Geo TV reported. Children chant 'Death to America' This comes a day after about 100 small children in Karachi repeated anti-American slogans during a protest in the coastal Pakistani city, a police official said. Video showed children repeating an adult voice, ""Death to America"" and ""Any friend of America is a traitor."" ""Punish the blasphemer,"" children chanted Thursday. One placard read, ""Shut down website of blasphemous film."" The film reference is to the ""Innocence of Muslims,"" which mocks Mohammed as a womanizer, child molester and killer. A 14-minute trailer for the movie was first posted online in July, though it wasn't until this month that it came to the global consciousness. Since September 11, Muslims have staged a wave of protests in more than 20 countries decrying the film and the nation in which it was privately produced, the United States. The children in Karachi -- seemingly between the ages of 6 and 8 -- demonstrated across from the Karachi Press Club, said Ghulam Qadir, a Karachi police official charged with keeping track of all demonstrations at the club. The event was not formal or planned, so authorities didn't know ahead of time it would happen, he said. In general, Pakistani parents are not informed about every event organized by a school. At least four teachers accompanied the children to the demonstration, Qadir said. There did not appear to be any parents there. Facilities close in Indonesia . The U.S. Embassy in Jakarta, , the U.S. Consulate General in Surabaya and U.S. Consular Agency in Bali and two other facilities would all be closed Friday because of the ""potential for significant demonstrations that might be held in front of these facilities."" officials said in a news statement. Protests have demonstrated in Indonesia last week. About 100 demonstrators gathered last Tuesday near a U.S. diplomatic facility in Medan, Indonesia, the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta said. German Embassy to close in Sudan . The German embassy in Sudan's capital city Khartuom will be closed Friday as authorities anticipate protests over the cartoon published in French magazine Charlie Hebdo, state-run Ashorooq TV reported. ""Security measures have been tightened at other diplomatic mission abroad,"" Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said. Tunisian authorities ban all demonstrations Friday . Seeking to avoid a repeat of what happened exactly one week earlier, Tunisia's interior ministry banned all demonstrations Friday, the state-run Tunisian News Agency (TAP) reported, citing a statement from the ministry. The report said the protest ban is ""in accordance with the provisions of the state of emergency"" that has been in place since the ouster January of its longtime president, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. The statement refers to ""calls launched via social networks"" to demonstrate over the Charlie Hebdo cartoons. And it comes six days after four protesters died and 49 were wounded during an assault Friday on the U.S. Embassy in the capital of Tunis, TAP previously reported, citing Charles Nicolle Hospital interim general director Souad Sadraoui. Presidential spokesman Adnene Mansar denounced Charlie Hebdo's publication of the cartoons as a ""deliberate insult,"" adding that ""some circles are deliberately seeking to stir up tension in relations binding the Muslim and Western worlds."" ""We should not fall in the trap of provocation, we should rather denounce these acts by peaceful means,"" Mansar said, according to a TAP report. National Constituent Assembly Speaker Mustapha Ben Jaafar said, in another TAP story, that the bloody September 14 protests ""do not reflect the mood of the moderate and tolerant Tunisian people."" ""Political, ideological and religious violence is (no) longer tolerated in present-day Tunisia,"" Jaafar said Strasbourg in eastern France, calling abiding by the ""rule of law ... an absolute priority.""

"Editor's note: Jeffrey A. Miron is senior lecturer in economics at Harvard University. Economist Jeffrey Miron says it's better to cut taxes than to raise government spending. CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts (CNN) -- When the Obama administration takes office in January, it will propose a fiscal stimulus consisting of increased government spending and lower taxes. By all accounts, the package will be big -- at least $700 billion, and possibly $1 trillion, over two years. The goal will be to end or moderate the recession. According to the textbooks, government spending raises the demand for goods and services. Tax cuts also spur demand by putting more income in the hands of consumers or more after-tax profits in the hands of businesses. Is a fiscal stimulus good policy? The answer is no if the stimulus consists of increased spending. The stimulus may be good policy, though, if it consists of lower taxes. Consider first the increased spending. If the new spending is for projects that are beneficial for society overall, and if the private sector cannot or will not undertake these projects, then the expenditure is worthwhile independent of what it does to fight the recession. A standard example might be repair of the interstate highway system. This justification for additional spending is far from compelling, however. No doubt some roads need repairs, but the U.S. already spends huge amounts on its highway system. The U.S. could address existing deficiencies by increasing the use of toll roads and charging drivers extra at rush hour, or by repealing prevailing wage laws that inflate construction costs. Similar caveats apply to other proposed increases in government spending. Research on alternative energy is fine, but government funding is likely to come with costly strings and political interference. A better policy is higher taxes on gasoline and other fossil fuels, which would enhance the private sector's incentive to undertake such research. Additional spending on education makes sense in some cases, but the level of spending is already substantial. Improvements in education are more likely to come from expanded school choice and elimination of policies that limit efficiency, such as rigid hiring and firing rules negotiated by unions. Even if certain components of the nation's spending are too low, nothing guarantees that new spending will be directed to these areas. Instead, experience suggests that much will be for repairing ""bridges to nowhere,"" especially those located in the districts of influential legislators. The Keynesian argument for a spending stimulus does not, of course, assume this spending is for projects that have economic or social value. The theory, in fact, suggests that digging ditches and then filling them up is effective at stimulating the economy. This cannot make sense in the long run; government spending must be paid for with taxes, so it ultimately comes at the expense of private spending. Projects that do not make economic sense are then pure waste. Yet the history of government spending indicates the stimulus package will include countless zoos, aquariums, museums, parks and other pork barrel projects for which the private demand does not come close to justifying the investment. In many cases, these projects will persist for decades. Even in the short-run, the economic effect of public spending is often weak since it partially crowds out private spending. Research subsidies for green technologies, for example, mainly give private companies money for research they would otherwise undertake themselves. In any case, spending operates with a substantial lag, so it can kick in long after it is needed. The case for a spending stimulus is therefore weak. Consider instead using tax cuts to simulate the economy. Most tax cuts enhance economic efficiency by giving the private sector better incentives. Reductions in the corporate income tax, for example, increase the incentives for investment, while reductions in personal income taxes raise the incentives for work and saving. Tax cuts also stimulate demand via the standard Keynesian channels of increased disposable income for consumers and higher cash flow for businesses. Tax cuts thus improve economic performance in the long run and the short run. Recent analyses of past tax cuts and spending increases, moreover, suggest that cutting taxes is the more effective approach. Any stimulus package should therefore consist mainly of tax cuts. Whether a major tax cut is desirable depends on one's view about the current size of government. For those who believe government should be at least as large as it is now, tax cuts are problematic because they add to an already dismal deficit picture. Social Security and Medicare, in particular, are projected to boost the deficit dramatically, implying higher tax rates will be required to achieve budget balance. Rigid focus on the deficit might not be appropriate in a recession, but the long-run outlook still suggests caution about any policy that increases the current deficit. For those who advocate smaller government, the case for a tax cut is easier; short-run increases in the deficit are not a major concern if government should be smaller (and can eventually be reduced in size) in the long run. If the level of spending is too high, the U.S. can have its cake and eat it too: cut taxes now to improve efficiency and stimulate the economy and cut spending later to balance the budget. Is the U.S government too large? This is not the place to address that question, but it is the crucial issue that policymakers and society must confront. If the level of spending is about right, then the U.S. must raise taxes sooner or later. A tax cut now therefore means an even larger increase down the line. The overall point is that government spending should be determined by long-run costs and benefits, while taxes should be sufficient to pay for programs that make sense on these grounds. Concern with stabilizing the economy in the short run is understandable, but it often generates policies that are counterproductive over the long haul. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeffrey Miron.","Jeffrey Miron: Obama administration planning big economic stimulus package .

"(CNN) -- Ger Jansen is puzzling about how to fit a windshield. His problem is not installing it in a car, but hanging the glass in thin air and keeping it hovering for a prolonged display. This is a fairly typical challenge for the Dutch engineer, who along with his daughter Angela runs Crealev, a leading levitation design firm. The mysterious art of floating has been largely confined to ultra-specialist industry applications and magician tricks, but the Jansens have developed a repertoire for any occasion; from lifting a model's top hat for a fashion shoot to a giant rock in a striking art display. They have given sneakers air for Nike, and produced a range of self-suspending lamps for the home. These are all given flight by patented modules that induce magnetic levitation. The kit is comprised of two parts: a magnetic disc that can be integrated into the chosen object, and a base containing sensors that pin it in space. The latest and most heavy-duty module can support up to 10 kilograms to a height of nine centimeters, but bespoke services are available for unlimited height and weight. ""Our customers drive us by requesting more demanding solutions,"" says Jansen. ""For the higher and heavier loads we have to combine the largest levitation modules."" The company is also developing programming to make the magnets smarter, more responsive and capable of more sophisticated movement. ""People don't want something to just float but also to interact with it. What should happen then is that sensors around the object move depending on the movement of people, so the object is more intelligent."" Jansen is flooded with requests to make every conceivable item levitate. One popular option for illusionists and thrill-seekers is to make a human float, which he is pursuing with some reservations. ""You could have magnets inserted into clothes but it would not feel like resting on the clouds ... If you have these magnets working together it's a giant force. It can hurt the skin. There need to be safety precautions."" The Chairless Chair, an invisible chair that you can wear . The Jansens are not alone as there is a growing market of levitating applications for consumers. A Californian company has released a set of floating speakers, promising a unique experience for the listener. Czech designers have produced a computer mouse buoyed by magnetic levitation, designed to alleviate carpal tunnel syndrome. But the limiting factor of magnetic levitation is requiring a base to float over, effectively requiring that objects are stationary. This largely puts paid to the hoverboard dream inspired by ""Back to the Future"" -- another of the Jansens' most common requests -- and explains why transport seems the best placed industry to make use of the technique. Until recently, ""Maglev"" trains were expected to revolutionize public transport, promising increased speeds over 300mph. But the high cost and energy consumption has slowed their growth and today only China and Japan operate such a system. That could change with the advent of superconductor-powered vehicles, able to generate greater magnetic force with lower power consumption. High concept projects such as China's 'Super Maglev' would use this system for supersonic transport, and it could even support space missions. Dr. Ludwig Schultz of Dresden' Institute for Metallic Materials works with maglev vehicles and feels superconduction offers significant advantages. ""It gives you much more freedom. The energy storage is more efficient, and there are no moving parts. It can be extremely fast with frictionless motion."" Schultz has developed his own superconducting levitating vehicle -- the ""Supratrans,"" a lightweight buggy that hovers above tracks, held in place with a self-stabilizing mechanism. He imagines it being used for rapid transfers in airports, although one research area looks at creating routes and vehicles for private use. The spaceship reinvented for new frontiers . The applications from superconductors need not be limited to transport, says Schultz. He has consulted on projects to float a 60-ton stage, and to enhance gravity in space, among other ambitious plans. Another levitation breakthrough has come at the micro level, and by a different method. This year, Japanese scientists used acoustic levitation to manipulate small objects with three-dimensional capability for the first time. Researchers created a ""moveable ultrasonic focal point"" that allowed them unprecedented control with sound waves. Experts hailed the potential impact for molecular analysis for chemistry and medicine, but lead researcher Yoichi Ochiai of the University of Tokyo also foresees wider applications: ""I would like to draw huge levitated graphics in stadiums or concerts,"" he said. ""Or for use in our daily lives such as floating interactions at home and small object levitation."" In many cases, levitation technologies have yet to find meaningful functions, either serving novelty purposes or yet to break out of the research stage. But the possibilities are multiplying, and the applications are becoming established in fields such as entertainment and transport. If the spread continues, magicians may need to learn some new tricks. The Chairless Chair, an invisible chair that you can wear . The spaceship reinvented for new frontiers .

"(CNN) -- More than a week into the tournament, diehard World Cup fans are losing sleep and falling down on their jobs as they yell at their TV and computer screens. For those who haven't caught football fever, the enthusiasm and the sport may leave them befuddled. But behind the World Cup there are stories that can speak to everyone. 1. It's a family affair . When Germany and Ghana face off Saturday, two brothers will as well. For Jerome Boateng, Germany defender, the match will be especially loaded. He'll be playing against not just his half-brother, Ghana's midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng, but also their father's home country -- a place he's never even visited, according to FIFA. The brothers have reportedly ceased contact during the World Cup to keep their heads in the game. But will they hug on the field? And who will family members, if they're sitting in the stands, root for? Hopefully cameras will swing their direction so we can find out. 2. Seeking light amid the darkness of violence . Nigerians love their football. In fact, market researchers at Repucom determined it's got the world's biggest football fan base out there. More specifically, the firm's study shows 83% of Nigerians are interested in the sport and 65% participate. Those figures dwarf other nations, including World Cup host Brazil -- where 67% are fans and 28% play. So football fanatics from that African nation will certainly have a vested interest in their team's Saturday World Cup game against Bosnia and Herzegovina. And given the tragedy that befell football watchers last Tuesday -- when a Boko Haram-backed explosion rocked a viewing center in northeastern Nigeria, killing up to 21 sports fans -- a win for Nigerians may be extra sweet. 3. It's getting hot in here . The heat and humidity in Brazil, some locations more than others, have been taking a toll on players. Dehydration. Cramps. Even hallucinations. There have been complaints about it all. Some have attributed a rash of injuries to the conditions. The venue in Manaus, an Amazonian city, has been especially brutal. A quick online look at temps Saturday show that Argentina and Iran may be playing in 95-degree (Fahrenheit) conditions. The good news for them, though: humidity will only be at 45%. Conditions for Germany and Ghana, on the other hand, look like they'll be 67 degrees with 76% humidity; Nigeria and Bosnia and Herzegovina will face 86 degrees and about 61% humidity. The 2022 FIFA World Cup will be played in Qatar, where average temps this time of year exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit. 4. What's in a name? The Three Lions (England) may have gone home, but the Desert Foxes (Algeria) are still in the game. Each team in the World Cup arrives with a nickname. Some seem inspired: Clockwork Orange (Netherlands); the Coffee Growers (Colombia); Blue Samurai (Japan). Others are less so -- though at first glance they may fool you: Nationalmannschaft (Germany); Sbornaya (Russia), and Team Melli (Iran). The translation for these three: National Team. Really? That's the best you've got? There are three games Saturday. Here's who is up: . The White and Sky Blue (Argentina) v. Team Melli (Iran) National Team (Germany) v. Black Stars (Ghana) Super Eagles (Nigeria) v. Dragons (Bosnia and Herzegovina) 5. Kicking politics aside . The World Cup tournament, which draws together 32 nations, puts the sport before politics. That mindset remains year-round for Dan Gaspar, the Portuguese-American goalkeeping coach for team Iran -- which goes up against Argentina. He took the job in Iran to work with his friend and former colleague Carlos Queiroz, the football team's head coach. It was a decision that went against the advice of most. After all, wasn't Iran supposed to be America's enemy? ""Sports is my life,"" Gaspar told CNN's Reza Sayah. ""When I came to Iran it didn't have anything to do with political reasons. My personality is one of adventure and curiosity. I wanted to experience a culture in a part of the world I had never been to."" Iran has surprised him. His impressions before coming haven't matched reality. ""When you listen to the news and you read the news, you see things. Sometimes during commercials I step off my couch and look out of the balcony and it's not what I am seeing, it's not what I am reading, it's not what I am hearing,"" he told Sayah. ""If I would've listened to the experts, and my friends, and family, I would have never been here in Iran. It's been part of my life for three years and the memories will last a lifetime.""

"(CNN) -- It wasn't enough for Gregory Scott Hale to kill his victim, authorities say. He also chopped off her head, her hands, her feet. Buried her torso in a burn pile outside his south-central Tennessee home. And -- by his own admission -- ate some of her remains, according to the affidavit filed against him. According to the same document, Hale confessed to the killing of the 36-year-old woman, identified as Lisa Hyder by Capt. Frank Watkins of the Coffee County, Tennessee, Sheriff's Department. ""Lisa was a sweet girl, a very pretty girl,"" her friend and neighbor Vicki Keenan told CNN affiliate WSMV. ""... It's got to be a very sick mind to do something like that."" There's no indication Hale and Hyder knew each other before she was killed, apparently on Friday, said Watkins, who added that authorities don't have any reason yet to believe Hale had done this before. Authorities learned about the apparently random crime on Sunday and arrested Hale a day later. The affidavit says after killing her, the 37-year-old man put her slashed-off head and hands in a plastic bucket. Her feet and other cut-off body parts went into another bucket. It was not known who, if anyone right now, is legally representing the accused. Numerous CNN calls placed Tuesday to his relatives and associates were not immediately returned.

"(CNN) -- It didn't get a ton of attention Monday, but Apple's next mobile operating system means significant changes for how iPhone users send and receive messages. If you're an Apple user, this is a big deal. Messages is the most frequently used app in iOS, and is how most users share texts, photos and videos with each other. With iOS 8, coming this fall, Apple is borrowing features from popular messaging platforms like Snapchat and WhatsApp while unveiling some new tricks of its own. Here's a quick look at the new messaging features announced at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference. We'll find out in a few months whether they catch on with users. Audio and video messages . The text window in the next version of iMessage will contain a little microphone button. Users hold a finger down on the button, record a short audio or video message, and send it with the swipe of a finger -- all without leaving the app. In this way, Apple is taking a page from WhatsApp, which also allows audio and video messages. Facebook bought that startup, which has a huge user base overseas, in February for $19 billion. Audio files will appear in your Messages stream as jagged lines. Simply tap on them to listen to the message. Apple did not say Monday whether there will be a limit on the length of the messages. Self-destructing messages . Photo and video messages that disappear after a few seconds have been popularized by Snapchat, the mobile messaging app that reportedly spurned multibillion takeover offers from Facebook and Google last year. This ephemeral format has been especially popular with teens and young adults who like to exchange silly or racy messages without fear they'll be haunted by them later. Now Apple is getting into the game. Audio and video messages within iOS 8 will automatically vanish within a few minutes (Apple didn't say how many) unless you adjust your settings. ""You don't want to have to clean these up. Audio and video messages can take up space,"" said Greg Joswiak, head of iOS product marketing. ""So they're set to self-destruct unless you choose to keep them."" Do not disturb . Sure, group messaging threads among friends can be fun. But sometimes all the back-and-forth chatter gets out of hand. This feature lets you mute a thread for a while while reserving the option to rejoin the conversation later. ""If you've ever been on one of those noisy threads that just keeps buzzing in your pocket ... you can choose when to leave,"" said Apple Senior Vice President Craig Federighi, to applause from the audience. CNNMoney: Nice job, Apple. But I'm not coming back . Lock-screen functions . If you're in a hurry, responding to a message on an iPhone can be a little cumbersome: You have to punch in your passcode and then hit the Messages icon just to get started. With iOS 8, users can listen and respond to audio messages without leaving the lock screen -- just by holding the phone to their ear. The phone detects when it's next to your face, plays the message and lets you record a brief response. Lower the phone, and the message is sent automatically. ""It's super easy,"" said Joswiak. ""You can send a message ... just by raising it (the phone) to your ear."" This feature seems convenient but potentially glitchy if users send accidental messages just by speaking near their phone. There was no word from Apple on how to avoid this potential problem. Other stuff . If your contacts choose to share them, their locations will pop up in group-messaging threads. For the first time, users will be able to add or delete someone in the middle of a group-messaging thread. And message attachments -- images and videos, mostly -- will be collected in one place so you don't have to scroll back through longstanding threads to find them.","Apple's iOS 8 will bring big changes for how iPhone users send and receive messages .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Monday reiterated his call for a comprehensive package of steps against gun violence as the focus on possible Senate legislation appeared to narrow to expanded background checks and limited ammunition magazines, rather than a ban on semi-automatic rifles that mimic assault weapons. Obama took part in a discussion with Minneapolis officials before telling police officers and others that an increase in gun violence nationwide, including the Connecticut school massacre in December, made it vital to address the issue now. ""No law or set of laws can keep our children completely safe,"" Obama said in calling for ""basic, commonsense steps to reduce gun violence."" He added, ""if there's one life we can save, we've got an obligation to try."" Obama emphasized his support for banning semi-automatic rifles modeled after military weapons as part of an updated version of an earlier weapons ban that expired in 2004. Opponents led by the influential National Rifle Association, oppose any ban on weapons, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has indicated that such a provision faced an uphill struggle. Reid told ABC on Sunday that he backed expanding background checks to private gun sales at shows and other steps, but he refused to endorse a ban on what are called assault-style rifles modeled after military weapons. Obama shooting image gets blasted on the Web . A popular version is the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle that can be purchased with magazines holding 30 rounds. A similar weapon was used in the Connecticut school shooting that killed 20 first graders and revived a national focus on tougher gun control measures. While Obama and some top Democrats, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, seek a ban on many semi-automatic rifles, the NRA and politicians from both major parties oppose such a move as an infringement on constitutional rights. In his remarks Monday, Obama rejected that argument, urging supporters to tell opponents of renewed weapons ban that ""there's no legislation to eliminate all guns; there's no legislation being proposed to subvert the Second Amendment."" Obama's trip to Minneapolis was intended to raise attention to steps taken in the city, including a recent regional gun summit hosted by Mayor R.T. Rybak and Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett. Both cities have experienced mass shootings in recent months, and Obama met with two Minneapolis-area law enforcement officials last week when he discussed the issue with local police and sheriffs department members at the White House. The NRA and its leading supporters in Congress argue that steps proposed by Obama won't work and would fail to address the problem. For example, they say criminals skirt background checks, so expanding the system would miss the main target of the legislation. They also contend that the semi-automatic rifles targeted by Feinstein in a proposal introduced last week are used in a fraction of the nation's gun violence. Gun debate: Where is the middle ground? Obama and other supporters of stronger gun control measures say all possible efforts must be made to address what they call a chronic and growing problem of gun violence, particularly involving vulnerable targets such as students. Reid of Nevada is the top Senate Democrat, who sets the chamber's legislative schedule. He said Sunday that he wants the Judiciary Committee to produce a bill that could be debated by the full Senate and would be open to proposed amendments by any senator. However, Reid signaled that the committee version would lack the ban on assault-style weapons. ""If Dianne Feinstein, by the time it's through the Judiciary Committee, if she doesn't have her assault weapons, at least let her have an opportunity to offer this amendment"" on the Senate floor, Reid told ABC. Reid, who noted he owned guns and was a former law officer, said he opposed the Clinton-era assault weapons ban that expired midway through the Bush administration. He called for expanding background checks and steps to halt federal gun trafficking while saying the Senate should ""take a look at"" unspecified limits on ammunition magazines. Asked about backing he has received from the NRA, Reid said that ""just because they resist it doesn't mean we can't do things."" Other steps under consideration include better monitoring of people with mental illness to prevent them from obtaining guns. Democrats have said the background check measure would stand the best chance of garnering bipartisan support, including from some pro-gun Democrats. Even if passed by the Senate, a gun bill would face tougher scrutiny in the Republican-led House. Obama said Monday that lawmakers in Congress from both parties were working together on plans that would expand background checks to all gun purchases and criminalize ""straw purchases"" in which legal gun owners buy weapons for people prohibited from doing so. The faces of America's gun debate . Guns sold through private sales currently avoid background checks -- the so-called gun show loophole. Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York said last week that he was in talks with colleagues -- including several who are ranked highly by the NRA -- on possible legislation to expand background checks on private gun sales. Sources close to both Schumer and Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma told CNN the two were in serious discussions about co-sponsoring a bill to strengthen background checks. Schumer sits on the Judiciary Committee, while Coburn is a former member. However, NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre told the panel that the current background check system doesn't work, so expanding it would only create an unmanageable government bureaucracy instead of reducing gun crime. During the Super Bowl on Sunday night, a group called Mayors Against Illegal Guns broadcast an ad showing the NRA's LaPierre, in 1999, endorsing the expanded background checks his group now opposes. Supporters of gun control argue that the constitutional right to bear arms can be limited, for example, by the existing ban on private citizens possessing grenade launchers and other military weaponry. However, Denver University law professor David Kopel said last week that the Supreme Court made clear that gun control could not include weapons used commonly by law-abiding citizens, such as the top-selling AR-15 that Feinstein's legislation would ban. CNN's Kevin Liptak contributed to this report .","NEW: Obama says no law can stop all gun violence, but the nation must try .

"A statin can be a lifesaver if you're at risk of heart disease, but some people who take the cholesterol-lowering drugs -- up to 20 percent, by some estimates -- have to stop because of muscle pain, the most common side effect. (Nearly 30 million people filled a statin prescription in 2005, according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Statins include popular drugs such as Crestor, Lipitor, and Zocor.) Some patients who take statins to cut the cholesterol buildup in their arteries experience muscle pain. Now a new study suggests that an over-the-counter dietary supplement sold at pharmacies and health-food stores may be a workable alternative for people who have statin-related muscle pain. It seems that when combined with diet and lifestyle changes, red yeast rice supplements can lower LDL, or bad cholesterol, levels by more than 20 percent without a substantial risk of muscle pain (also known as myalgia), according to a study published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine. ""For some people, especially if they've had muscle aching, taking red yeast rice and making lifestyle changes can work as well as a statin,"" says lead study author David Becker, M.D., of Chestnut Hill Cardiology in Pennsylvania. Although these and other results are promising (in a previous study led by Becker, a combination of red yeast rice and fish oil outperformed simvastatin, the generic version of Zocor), people with high cholesterol shouldn't race to the vitamin store just yet. Red yeast rice is ""not a panacea for all people with statin-association myalgias,"" Becker cautions. In some patients, the supplements may cause a recurrence of muscle pain, or other serious muscle problems that are more difficult to detect. Health.com: Myths and facts About cholesterol . Plus, consumers who buy red yeast rice off the shelf don't necessarily know what they're getting. The Food and Drug Administration does not regulate dietary supplements, and the contents and potency of red yeast rice pills have been shown to vary widely among manufacturers. Some pills might even be dangerous: A 2008 analysis of red yeast rice products conducted by a supplement-industry watchdog group found a potentially toxic ingredient in 4 of out 10 brands -- one was the store brand of a major pharmacy chain. What is red yeast rice? Becker and his colleagues studied 62 patients with high cholesterol who had to stop taking at least one statin because of muscle pain. Half of the patients took six capsules of red yeast rice daily for six months, and the other half received identical placebo capsules. For the first three months, all of the patients also attended weekly meetings in which they were taught how to eat well, exercise, and maintain a healthy lifestyle. After three months, the LDL levels of those taking the active red yeast rice had declined 27 percent, on average, compared with 6 percent in the placebo group; at six months the decline in the active group was still more than 21 percent. And only 2 of the 29 patients who took red yeast rice in the study developed myalgia -- a far smaller percentage than could have been expected had they tried another statin. But in a way, the study participants did try another statin. Red yeast rice, which has been used in Chinese medicine for hundreds of years, is derived from a fungus that grows on rice. It contains a series of compounds that slow the production of cholesterol in the liver. One of those compounds, monacolin K, is a naturally occurring form of lovastatin, the active ingredient in Mevacor, a brand-name statin that was approved by the FDA in 1987 and now available as a generic. Health.com: Heart attack prognosis may depend on what's in your medicine cabinet . In effect, red yeast rice is a low-dose lovastatin, which may explain why it can sometimes cause muscle pain in statin-intolerant patients, according to Becker. At the same time, the reduction in LDL that the supplements provide can't be attributed solely to the monacolin K, says Becker, so there must be other cholesterol-lowering ingredients in red yeast rice. The patients in Becker's study received a dose of monacolin K roughly five times smaller than the typical lovastatin prescription, yet the reduction in their LDL levels was comparable to the average drop patients see on a statin. ""Clearly something else is having a powerful lipid-lowering effect,"" says Becker. Although the patients' lifestyle changes probably helped, the findings suggest that some of the other compounds found in red yeast rice may enhance the effects of the naturally occurring lovastatin. The researchers used a supplement manufactured by Sylvan Bioproducts, but Becker says he doesn't endorse or recommend any particular brand of red yeast rice. The contents were analyzed before the beginning of the study, which was funded by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. Becker and the other researchers did not report any financial conflicts of interest. Red yeast rice supplements are not for everyone . Not all cardiologists are sold on the potential utility of red yeast rice. ""Despite the preliminary evidence that the average patient suffering from muscle pain might see some lipid-lowering without having the pain again, we're not to ready to recommend red yeast rice to our patients,"" says Paul Phillips, M.D., a cardiologist who runs a clinic for statin-related muscle complications at Scripps Mercy Hospital, in San Diego, California. In an editorial accompanying Becker's study, Dr. Phillips notes that the incidence of muscle pain reported among the study participants taking red yeast rice (about 7 percent) could be artificially low. Roughly half of the patients who experience muscle pain after starting a statin eventually begin to feel better as their bodies become accustomed to the drug, says Dr. Phillips, and that could have occurred in the study participants. Health.com: In reallLife, heart-healthy diets can be work . More important, he adds, the majority of patients who experience statin-related myalgia never have pain. Instead, they may experience muscle atrophy, weakness, and fatigue potentially serious side effects that the new study may have overlooked. (Although side effects other than myalgia weren't formally tracked, there were ""no significant adverse events"" in the patients taking red yeast rice, Becker says.) Health.com: Are you cholesterol smart? Take this quiz . Red yeast rice isn't appropriate for everyone with high cholesterol, agrees Becker. He says that people who have had a heart attack or who have significant blockages in their arteries due to atherosclerosis should not replace a statin or other medical therapy with red yeast rice, since statins are proven to reduce the risk of heart attack and death. ""I don't think it would be wise to ever consider using red yeast rice if you have a known heart problem,"" Becker says. Supplements not immune to safety concerns . In fact, all people looking to lower their cholesterol levels should think twice before taking red yeast rice, Becker advises. Red yeast rice is ""quite a bit stronger"" than other dietary supplements used to lower cholesterol, he says, and the market is poorly regulated. In 2008, the supplement-industry watchdog group ConsumerLab.com analyzed 10 brands of capsules whose labels advertised 600 milligrams of red yeast rice. When the products were tested in a lab, however, they were found to contain wildly different amounts of lovastatin and other compounds. ""There was a 100-fold difference from the lowest to the highest,"" says ConsumerLab.com president Tod Cooperman. An unexpectedly large dose of lovastatin could cause serious side effects and could interact with other drugs. The uncertain lovastatin content of red yeast rice products have led to a long-running dispute between the manufacturers of the pills and the federal government. A decade ago, the FDA successfully sought to regulate a red yeast rice extract known as Cholestin, claiming that the lovastatin it contained made it an unapproved statin rather than a supplement. Any red yeast product containing more than trace amounts of lovastatin can also be regulated (and effectively banned) by the FDA, but red yeast rice products containing monacolin K have remained on the market. And though the FDA does continues to monitor the industry -- in 2007, the agency warned three manufacturers that their red yeast rice products were unapproved drugs the woolly marketplace for supplements should make consumers wary. ""I would never, under any circumstances, suggest that someone take red yeast rice,"" says Dr. Phillips. ""It's not controlled, it's not safe, and it hasn't been approved by the FDA in such a way that it's formulated to be consistent.""

"(CNN) -- You've researched, planned and shot an excellent photographic story -- well, unfortunately your work is not done. You will need to edit your imagery into a cohesive body which best communicates the facts, the emotions and core storyline to your viewers. Processing and color-correcting your digital photos comes first. After that, writing captions to go along with your images will add the necessary context. These are some of the visual journalist's toughest tasks. But, don't fret! Here are some key ideas to keep in mind as you start editing, digital post-processing and caption writing: . Editing photos . The skills required to edit your photographic story need to be as sharp as your picture taking. But emotional and physical experiences a photographer encounters while shooting can powerfully influence their edit, and even cloud their judgment. That's why input from other professionals or just friends and family can be helpful. Getting fresh eyes on your photo essay and listening to feedback can really help hone your narrative. Making the first, general edit is relatively easy because it is often clear which images are worth keeping. The real challenge is making the tough decision to remove photographs that you love for the benefit of the story. Editing down to a set of images which reflect a coherent narrative can make those images all the more powerful. Try to cover the following elements in you photographic essay: . Introduction (establishing shot): This is usually a wide shot that shows your audience the setting of your story. Medium shot: This shot helps establish the who and what of your story. Close-up: Get closer to your subject and show the smaller details of your story. Portrait: If your story focuses on a person, make sure you get a portrait shot of them. Interaction: Action shots grab attention and show your subjects in the environment. Signature Shot: Pull out your key-element and decisive-moment shots. Sequence: How you organize your photos will make a big difference in how your story is perceived. Make sure you organize you photos that will tell the story. Rules can be bent and broken, but you need to understand them first. It's helpful to arrange your photographs in a linear sequence: Introduce your viewers to the setting and characters. Move them through the story using interaction, a sequence and key elements. And finally, give the viewer some sense of an ending even if the story has yet to find resolution. Provide a final photograph that encourages the viewer to linger, to contemplate the information they've consumed and either ask questions, guess the meaning or come to an understanding. Digital post-processing . In a news story, what amount of digital post-processing is acceptable? News imagery must adhere to strict journalistic standards. A good general rule is to only use basic techniques that were, in the days of analogue photography, applied in the darkroom. That means minor exposure compensation, burning, dodging, color correction, contrast enhancement and cropping. During post-production, you should always ask yourself, ""Am I altering the viewers understanding of the facts? Does my post-production technique remove or destroy information?"" If you're using Photoshop filters, heavy color treatments, drastically changing exposure or overly increasing contrast, the answer is yes. Caption writing . A caption is an informative paragraph written by the photographer to accompany the image. Captions are essential to storytelling and communicate important facts. Unfortunately, caption writing is often the most underdeveloped skill of a visual journalist. When crafting a caption it's important to be accurate, informative and complete. Give your audience the basic information -- the who, what, when, where and why of the situation depicted in your image. And write them in present tense whenever possible. Now it's your turn .

"(CNN) -- He was the logical synthesis of John Wayne and Jack Benny. Interlace the Duke's measured drawl and virile swagger with Benny's comic timing and shrewd use of wordless exasperation, and you have James Garner, who died Saturday night in Los Angeles at 86. His persona: Laid-back pragmatist ... or, if you needed to be a tad more provocative about it, coolly principled coward. It endeared him to generations of moviegoers and television viewers. Garner's most cherished roles shared, to varying degrees, a bent gallantry that saw little need to advertise or flaunt itself before others. In his entry on ""The Rockford Files""-- the 1974-80 TV series in which Garner played a perennially, often unjustly besieged private detective living in a trailer -- Gene Sculatti's ""The Catalog of Cool"" summed up ""Gentleman Jim's beat message: Very few expenditures of energy are worth the effort. Like Zen, man."" But Garner did not only embody this persona in ""Rockford Files'"" eponymous character Jim Rockford (for which he won a best actor Emmy in 1977), but also Bret Maverick, the well-tailored Texas card sharp and reluctant do-gooder from the 1957-62 Western series ""Maverick."" That star-making role represented something relatively new in the cowboy genre: A manly hero, able to take care of himself, who was nonetheless far more inclined to use his wits rather than his fists to get out of a jam. More often than not, Maverick's way was the winning way. Same with Rockford. If powerful gangsters leaned on him and told him to back off an investigation, Jim Rockford would weigh his options, consider the bruises on his face and decide the hell with it. Somehow things would turn out OK in the end without him losing any cred with his clients -- or his audience. Then there were those back-to-back Burt Kennedy Western spoofs, 1969's ""Support Your Local Sheriff"" and 1971's ""Support Your Local Gunfighter,"" in which he played separate versions of the slow-thinking, fast-acting wayfaring stranger who'd rather do anything than be a hero. If the local pokey had no bars on its cells, no problem: All Garner's character in ""Sheriff"" needed was a bucket of red paint and a couple of well-placed faux bullet holes to make sure his prisoner didn't leave without permission. If these characters made skewed heroism look easy, it's because Garner made acting look easy, too. His was the kind of nonchalant grace that in the 1930s or '40s would have made him a major movie star, at home in comedy or drama as were Cary Grant or Clark Gable. But things weren't always as easy for Garner as he made them seem. He was often beset with physical ailments during his long, grueling ""Rockford"" run. And at the peak of his earlier ""Maverick"" popularity, he left the series -- in its third season -- over a dispute with Warner Brothers and tested his luck with the movies. For a while, the movies didn't quite know what to do with him, casting him as stoic action heroes (with mixed results) in such World War II epics as ""Up Periscope"" (1959), ""The Great Escape"" (1963) and ""36 Hours"" (1965). He was an effective foil for Doris Day in 1963's ""Move Over, Darling"" and ""The Thrill of It All,"" but was miscast in ""Grand Prix"" (1966) where his best scenes were arguably behind a race car's wheels. One picture, however, shines like a beacon from this period: ""The Americanization of Emily"" (1963), which Garner always cited in interviews as his favorite -- with most of his fans in agreement. The lead role fit him like the proverbial glove: Navy Lt. Cmdr. Charlie Madison, whose relatively cushy World War II posting as an admiral's aide-de-camp in London first repels, then attracts a prim British war widow (Julie Andrews) bemused by his staunch dedication to cowardice in the midst of war. Charlie, speaking as if he were a lineal descendant of Brother Bret Maverick, insists throughout that cowardice is the only honest, rational response. (Because it's a comedy, he naturally ends up on Omaha Beach trying to get away from Nazi bullets.) ""So far this war,"" Charlie explains to the widow's widowed mother, ""we've managed to butcher some 10 million humans in the interest of humanity. Next war it seems we'll have to destroy all of man in order to preserve his damn dignity. It's not war that's unnatural to us, it's virtue. As long as valor remains a virtue, we shall have soldiers. So, I preach cowardice. Through cowardice, we shall all be saved."" Such words were warmed to near-humidity by screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky -- by way of William Bradford Huie's novel. But it took an actor of Garner's innate charm, unassuming earnestness and modulated intensity to drive them home and let them resonate nearly 15 years into the new millennium. Charm and modulation aren't Oscar bait -- and the closest Garner came to getting one was a best actor nomination for 1985's ""Murphy's Romance"" in which he played a liberal small-town pharmacist wooing Sally Field's overwrought, overburdened divorcee. But Garner won something in the long, fertile run of his life's work that other actors would covet even more: Abiding affection from audiences, so deep and wide that they were always glad to see him show up on big or small screens in any context, any role of any dimension. In his later interviews, Garner insisted that all he ever wanted in life was for people to smile whenever they thought of his name. Done, and done.","Gene Seymour: James Garner won a devoted following playing the coolly principled coward .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- For much of this election season, I saw a lot to admire in Marco Rubio. I liked the independence and courage he showed in going against the Republican Party establishment by challenging Gov. Charlie Crist in the U.S. Senate race in Florida. And when Rubio was viciously and unfairly attacked by presumptuous white liberals for not being authentically Latino, I liked him even more. And now? Not so much. It's all because of how Rubio bungled his reaction to an Arizona law that -- despite supporters' assurances that it won't lead to racial and ethnic profiling -- is certain to lead to racial and ethnic profiling. In true Kerryesque fashion, Rubio was against the law before he was in favor of it. As the intelligent, charismatic and well-spoken son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio rose through the ranks quickly to become speaker of the Florida Assembly before taking on Crist for the GOP Senate nomination. Rubio had not only vanquished Crist's nomination hopes but, in effect, ran him out of the party. The governor is now running for the Senate as an independent, against both Rubio and presumptive Democratic nominee Kendrick Meek. In fact, things were going smoothly for Rubio until Arizonans passed a law intended to deputize state and local police officers to act as surrogate immigration agents. The idea behind SB 1070 is to round up as many illegal immigrants as possible by requiring that police check the immigration status of people with whom they come in contact if officers have ""reasonable suspicion"" to believe that the person is the country illegally -- whether police want to or not. Despite the fact that the law is enormously popular with the GOP base, Rubio rightly opposed it as overly broad and flat-out dangerous. Just a few weeks ago, he said in a statement: . ""States certainly have the right to enact policies to protect their citizens, but Arizona's policy shows the difficulty and limitations of states trying to act piecemeal to solve what is a serious federal problem. From what I have read in news reports, I do have concerns about this legislation. While I don't believe Arizona's policy was based on anything other than trying to get a handle on our broken borders, I think aspects of the law, especially that dealing with 'reasonable suspicion,' are going to put our law enforcement officers in an incredibly difficult position. It could also unreasonably single out people who are here legally, including many American citizens. Throughout American history and throughout this administration we have seen that when government is given an inch it takes a mile."" Rubio was right to be concerned. SB 1070 is such a deeply flawed piece of legislation that it had to be amended a week after it was signed. Supporters say the changes prevent racial and ethnic profiling. Now, police officers can prowl for illegal immigrants only in the course of enforcing some other law or ordinance. In the original version, all that was required was ""lawful contact."" Another change is that now, the state attorney general or a county attorney cannot investigate complaints based on a person's race, color or national origin. The original law allowed for race, color and national origin to be considered as one of several factors and only prohibited law enforcement from focusing ""solely"" on those characteristics. That was good enough for Rubio, who now says he backs the controversial law as amended. Apparently, his concerns about racial profiling have been assuaged. Glad to hear it. Trouble is, now I have concerns about Rubio. He can't be that gullible. So he must be in denial. The amendments are totally cosmetic. In the real world of policing, it's impossible for law enforcement officers -- particularly those who lack the specialized training given to Border Patrol agents -- to make assumptions about one's legal status without taking race and ethnicity into account. We can tell them not to think about race and ethnicity, but that only makes them more likely to think about them. Anyone who claims otherwise is dishonest, disingenuous or delusional. Besides, there was an additional change in the law that arguably makes it even more dangerous and more divisive. Now, the requirement that a police officer must determine the immigration status of an individual who they have a ""reasonable suspicion"" is in the country illegally extends to those instances where police respond to something as minor as city ordinance violations. That could include loud parties, barking dogs, cars on blocks, overcrowded apartments, etc. One can easily imagine neighbors turning in one another, and an environment that is already poisoned with resentment and fear becoming more so. Supporters say they changed SB 1070. Believe it. They made it worse and more likely to lead to abuse. Anyone who doesn't see that must be blind. Of course, ambition has been known to have that effect on people. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette used to admire Marco Rubio, who challenged Gov. Crist in Florida election .

"(CNN) -- Eighteen people are stranded in the town of Mogollon, New Mexico, after the only road in and out of town was washed away, according to a spokesman for Gov. Susana Martinez. New Mexico declared a statewide disaster Friday because of flooding. The torrential downpours and severe flooding that hit the state left one person dead. Mogollon is a secluded mountain town surrounded by the Gila National Forest. It once was a mining hub for silver, copper and gold and was home to about 2,000 people before the mines closed in 1942, according to Mogollon Enterprises, which operates tourist storefronts in the city. Billing itself as ""the ghost town that refuses to die,"" Mogollon hosts an antiques store, artisans gallery, cafe, museum and theater, most of them re-fashioned out of the town's original 19th-century structures. The Mogollon Theater is considered the oldest ""intact"" movie house in the state, Mogollon Enterprises says. Roughly an equal distance from Albuquerque, New Mexico, El Paso, Texas, and Tucson, Arizona, Mogollon is now largely a tourist attraction boasting hiking, hummingbirds and stargazing. The National Guard will be providing food, water and sanitary supplies Tuesday, and a bulldozer will scrape the road to provide access to the village, said Enrique Knell, the governor's spokesman. The plan now is for the National Guard to bring supplies to the village on foot instead of flying them in. ""It is only about a mile walk, and they had trouble finding a good landing zone,"" Knell said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is expected to assist. No air evacuations are expected.

"(CNN) -- Claiming Barack Obama thinks a ""free enterprise economy"" is ""the cause of our problems"" -- not, as he sees it, the solution -- Sen. Marco Rubio argued Tuesday that the president's proposals would hurt middle class citizens more than help them. ""Mr. President, I don't oppose your plans because I want to protect the rich,"" the Florida Republican said in his rebuttal to Obama's State of the Union address. ""I oppose your plans because I want to protect my neighbors."" The 41-year-old lawmaker, viewed as a possible presidential candidate and declared by Time magazine as ""The Republican Savior,"" was tapped to give his party's response to the speech. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, also rebutted Obama on behalf of the conservative tea party caucus. Rubio largely kept to his prepared remarks, except when he abruptly stopped talking about halfway through to reach for a drink of water. The son of Cuban immigrants referred emotively to his personal story and that of his family, though his policy criticisms and proposals were largely in line with prevailing mainstream and, in some cases, conservative Republican thinking. On immigration, for instance, on which Rubio has been one of his party's most outspoken proponents of efforts to ""modernize"" the current system, he didn't mention his past support of a route to citizenship for undocumented immigrants now in the United States. The senator did generally advocate ""a responsible, permanent solution to the problem of those who are here illegally."" But he added that first, ""we must follow through on the broken promises of the past to secure our borders and enforce our laws."" Speaking about gun control measures, one of the most emotional parts of Obama's State of the Union speech, Rubio said he was for ""effectively"" dealing with such violence, then added, ""but unconstitutionally undermining the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans is not the way to do it."" CNN Fact Check: Rubio says Obamacare needs a check up . He sharply criticized Obama on many fronts. The president, Rubio claimed, had unfairly cast Republicans as opposing the environment and seniors, and only caring about rich people. He contended that it was Obama who,if his plans are enacted, would hurt the majority of Americans by preventing the economy from growing. ""The tax increases and the deficit spending you propose will hurt middle class families,"" Rubio said, referring to Obama. ""It will cost them their raises. It will cost them their benefits. It may even cost some of them their jobs."" His remarks often reflected the sharp partisan divide on budgetary matters. Top Democrats, including Obama, have consistently said that increased government revenues should be paired with spending cuts to bring down the deficit. Congress already raised tax rates on top income earners as part an agreement in January to avert the worst aspects of the so-called fiscal cliff. And now, Obama and Democrats want to eliminate some tax breaks and loopholes to further raise revenue. Republican leaders have sought to reduce the size of government and, therefore, generally oppose any increase in tax revenue. 5 things we learned from the State of the Union . They have called for aggressive spending cuts and steps to overhaul entitlement programs, while rejecting any new attempts to increase revenue as part of further steps to reduce the deficit. Obama's ""solution to virtually every problem we face is for Washington to tax more, borrow more and spend more,"" Rubio said. The president did, in fact, propose several new programs aimed at bolstering the economy, though he insisted they wouldn't add to the deficit. Opinion: Rubio missed the year of the woman . ""The idea that more taxes and more government spending is the way to help hardworking middle-class taxpayers, that's an old idea that has failed every time it's been tried,"" Rubio said. ""More government isn't going to help you get ahead. It's going to hold you back."" Rubio said he agreed with Obama on lowering the corporate tax rate, but didn't mention the president's support for closing tax loopholes that inordinately benefit the rich. Rubio backed school choice for all parents and said that student financial aid should evolve to help more ""nontraditional students."" Talk Back: Is giving the State of the Union the political 'kiss of death'? On energy policy, the senator derided Obama's administration for ""wasting ... taxpayer money on so-called clean energy ventures like Solyndra."" Rubio favors ""reform"" of energy regulations and opening up ""more federal lands for safe and responsible (oil and gas) exploration,"" both common Republican themes. He spoke, too, of Medicare, the government-run health insurance program for seniors, arguing that changes are needed for it to continue. The president suggested he'd support ""modest reform"" of this entitlement program, but Rubio said Obama does not go far enough. ""I would never support any changes to Medicare that would hurt seniors like my mother,"" he said. ""But anyone who is in favor of leaving Medicare exactly the way it is right now is in favor of bankrupting it."" Near the end of his speech, Rubio prayed that Democrats and Republicans ""can come together to solve our problems,"" contending that, if they don't, the consequences will be stark. ""If we can get our economy healthy again, our children will be the most prosperous Americans ever,"" Rubio said. ""And if we do not, we will forever be known as the generation responsible for America's decline."" Opinion: A kinder, gentler, wiser Marco Rubio .","NEW: Sen.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Senate Intelligence Committee received a classified document on Thursday that seeks to justify the administration's policy of targeting Americans overseas via drone attacks, a congressional aide told CNN. The document was demanded by lawmakers, mainly Democrats concerned about secrecy in national security decisionmaking, ahead of a hearing later in the day on the nomination of John Brennan to become the next CIA director. It provides the Justice Department's legal rationale for the controversial policy of using lethal force against U.S. citizens fighting on behalf of terrorist groups. The drone campaign against al Qaeda and its allies has been one of Brennan's biggest legacies in the four years he has served as President Barack Obama's chief counterterrorism adviser. ""It is critical for the committee's oversight function to fully understand the legal basis for all intelligence and counterterrorism operations,"" Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein said after the Obama administration disclosed late on Wednesday that it would turn the secret information over to relevant committees. According to an official who spoke on condition of not being identified, Obama decided to turn over the legal opinion because he believes the scrutiny and debate is healthy. Congress last summer received an outline around the policy that became public this week. However, it was a white paper that did not carry any legal authority and did not satisfy congressional demands for detailed information. According to the public policy group New America Foundation, at least 28 of al Qaeda's leading members have been killed in drone strikes, including the U.S. citizen Anwar al-Awlaki, who officials said played an operational role in al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. In a 2012 speech at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, Brennan asserted that the drone strikes are legal under a military force authorization approved by Congress after the 2001 al Qaeda attacks on the United States. ""There is nothing in international law that bans the use of remotely piloted aircraft for this purpose or that prohibits us from using lethal force against our enemies outside of an active battlefield, at least when the country involved consents or is unable or unwilling to take action against the threat,"" Brennan said at the time. On Wednesday, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee said the attack that killed al-Awlaki was justified. ""This is somebody who had said that he didn't want his U.S. citizenship anymore,"" Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, told MSNBC's ""Andrea Mitchell Reports."" He said al-Awlaki had officially joined al Qaeda, and al Qaeda had declared war on the United States."" ""The legal basis of this goes back many, many years when U.S. citizens would go and fight for foreign nations that were engaging in combat with the United States,"" Rogers said. ""So what they were saying is, once you've made that choice, you no longer get the protections that you would. I mean, if you join the enemy overseas, you join the enemy overseas. And we're going to fight the enemy overseas."" But civil libertarians and other groups have not been satisfied with the administration's transparency or its policy. Christopher Anders, senior legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, told CNN that senators want answers to key questions around a program that Brennan was deeply involved in while at the White House. ""The most basic details of it have been withheld,"" he said. Amnesty International also said Congress should grill Brennan on his claim that the administration's drone strikes are ""conducted in full compliance with the law."" Iran says it has footage from downed U.S. drone . ""Furthermore, Congress should immediately hold public hearings with independent experts to examine the administration's legal reasoning and ensure that the administration is following the 'rule book' for the use of lethal force that already exists: international human rights law and, in the very narrow circumstances to which it applies, international humanitarian law,"" the group said. Moreover, Ben Emmerson, a United Nations expert on counterterrorism and human rights, announced plans in October to investigate U.S. drone attacks and the extent to which they cause civilian casualties. Opinion: John Brennan, Obama's counterterrorist . Obama defended it in an appearance last October on ""The Daily Show."" ""There are times where there are bad folks somewhere on the other side of the world, and you've got to make a call and it's not optimal,"" he said. ""And sometimes you've got to make some tough calls. But you can do so in a way that's consistent with international law and with American law.""

"Washington (CNN) -- It's arguably the most important poll number for any president: his approval rating. As President Barack Obama gets ready to give the first State of the Union address of his second term, his approval rating stands at 50%, with 43% saying they disapprove of his performance in the White House, according to a new CNN Poll of Polls, which averages the latest non-partisan, live operator national surveys. Five things to watch . Here's where the president stands as he prepares to lay out his second-term agenda: . Obama vs. Obama . The president's 50%-43% approval/disapproval rating is down just a bit from a 52%-43% approval/disapproval numbers in a CNN Poll of Polls in mid-January, just before his second inauguration. ""Historically speaking, it's not a surprise for a second-term president to lose a couple of points in the aftermath of his second inauguration,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. Obama approval rating edging down . Obama vs. predecessors . How does Obama stack up against the most recent two-term presidents as they gave the first State of the Union address of their second term? George W. Bush stood at 51% in January 2005 and Bill Clinton was at 62% in January 1997, according to CNN/Gallup/USA Today polling. Ronald Reagan had a 64% approval rating in January 1985 and two-thirds of Americans approved of Richard Nixon in January 1973, according to Gallup surveys. Nixon's high rating came just as he announced the end to the Vietnam War. 8 memorable State of the Union moments . Obama vs. Congress . While the president's approval rating is down slightly from last month and is lower than his immediate predecessors at the start of their second terms, his numbers are still far above both Democrats and Republicans in Congress. According to a Quinnipiac University national poll conducted earlier this month, 33% approved of the job Democrats in Congress were doing. While that doesn't look very good, it's better than congressional Republicans -- their approval rating in the survey stood at 19%. Clint Eastwood isn't satisfied with Congress . Priorities, priorities, priorities . So what do Americans want to hear from the president in his State of the Union address? According to that same Quinnipiac poll, 35% said Obama should focus on the economy, with 20% saying the federal budget deficit is most important to them. Gun policy came in third at 15%, followed by health care at 12%, foreign policy and immigration each at 5% and the environment at 3%. As for the top concern, 53% of those questioned said the economy is still in a recession, even though the recession technically ended 3Â½ years ago. Democrats, Republicans suggest priorities ahead of State of the Union . Who will be watching? Two-thirds of those surveyed in the Quinnipiac poll said they were very or somewhat likely to watch the State of the Union -- that includes 86% of Democrats, 64% of independents and 46% of Republicans. Besides the expected partisan divide, there's a slight gender gap, with 71% of women and 59% of men saying they are very or somewhat likely to watch the prime-time speech. The new CNN Poll of Polls, compiled and released on Monday, averages the three nonpartisan, live-operator national surveys conducted in the past two weeks: Gallup's daily tracking poll (from February 8 to 10); Fox News (February 4 to 6), and Quinnipiac University (January 30 to February 4).

"(CNN) -- ""I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear."" Nelson Mandela . For Kevin-Prince Boateng it was a depressingly familiar soundtrack: the monkey noises, the name-calling, the crude racial stereotyping. He'd always ignored it in the past, and for 25 minutes of AC Milan's match with lower league Pro Patria in early January this year he'd done the same. But then something inside him snapped. The 26-year-old picked up the ball and propelled it in the direction of his abusers before storming from the field of play, followed by his teammates. The game was over and Boateng's protest transformed this exhibition match into headline news around the globe, plunging football's authorities into crisis management mode. ""I could hear from the crowd some monkey noises and this went on for about 25 minutes. Every time I touched the ball I could hear the crowd,"" Boateng told CNN. ""I said to myself, in this kind of environment, in this situation, I don't want to play football anymore. ""I came to the dressing room and I was the first, and saw one (teammate), then the second one and then the whole team came. I was really surprised and then really proud. I thanked all of them for following me. ""After not even 10 minutes I had, like, 86 phone calls on my phone and I thought something had happened, but it was just an unbelievable impact. It went all around the world within the first hour."" The authorities react . Boateng's actions were applauded and condemned in equal measure but, undeniably, they forced the game's authorities to stand up and take notice. As recently as 2011 FIFA president Sepp Blatter told CNN that on-field racism didn't exist in football and that those who thought they'd been abused during a game should simply shake hands upon the final whistle and move on. He later insisted his comments had been misinterpreted and underlined his commitment to fighting racism in football and society. But while Blatter insisted that walking off the field was the wrong way to tackle discrimination, there's no doubt Boateng's protest provoked the head of world soccer's governing body into decisive action. A task force against racism and discrimination was formed, with Boateng invited to join ahead of its first meeting on May 6. It formulated proposals that would see any player or official found guilty of racism banned for five matches while teams could be docked points, expelled from competition or even relegated for persistent offenses. Those recommendations were ratified at FIFA's recent congress in Mauritius and were hailed by the task force's head Jeffrey Webb as a ""defining moment"" in soccer's fight against racism. Boateng was also invited to the United Nations, where he told the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination that racism was a ""dangerous disease."" UEFA, European football's governing body, went further than FIFA, implementing a minimum 10-match ban for racist abuse by players or officials and escalating measures for clubs including fines and stadium closures for repeat offenders. But although football's authorities have now adopted a stronger stance to combat what has long been an ugly stain on the game, the picture on the ground is more clouded. CNN contacted more than 15 European football associations asking a series of questions on the prevalence of racism. One of only a handful who replied, the Portuguese FA, said they don't have any record of racist abuse cases in their country. This despite Porto being fined $26,000 by UEFA for racist abuse directed at Mario Balotelli, then a Manchester City player, during a Europa League match in 2012. The English club was later fined $39,000 in the same competition for taking to the field late after halftime. On the ground in Serbia . The situation in Serbia reflects the complex nature of such an explosive topic. The technical director of the Serbian Football Association, Savo Milosevic, told CNN that his country's problems with racism have been exaggerated. ""I think people made out of this a much bigger problem than we actually have,"" he said. ""We don't have a strategy to fight against racism in the FA of Serbia, we also don't have a strategy in our government to fight against racism, simply because we don't consider this a problem here."" He cited the difficulties they face with crowd violence as a more pressing concern, with Serbia repeatedly warned about the conduct of its supporters, who rioted and caused a Euro 2012 qualifying game with Italy to be abandoned back in 2010. But the Serbian FA was recently fined £65,000 ($84,000) by UEFA after an ill-tempered under-21 match against England in which visiting player Danny Rose claimed he'd been subjected to monkey chants from the crowd. The incident, and the fine, prompted criticism of UEFA from the British government, whose sports minister Hugh Robertson expressed his disappointment at the sanctions in relation to what he called ""widespread racist abuse."" Milosevic, just like the Serbian FA did at the time, insisted the punishment was related to a brawl between the players and not to do with racism. Passionate fans . On CNN's visit to the Belgrade derby between Partizan and Red Star, notorious for the fervency of both sets of fans, there was violence in the stands, and several fires lit but no audible racism. Reflecting the diverse nature of many playing squads within European football, Red Star's team contained several black players who told CNN they'd experienced no racial abuse since joining the club. But while progress has been made on the field, with players from a wide range of nationalities sharing dressing rooms around Europe and standing together to present a united front against the scourge of discrimination, flashpoints keep occurring in the stands, especially in Italy. Lazio was issued with a $186,000 fine after racist chanting from its fans during three matches in the Europa League: two against English club Tottenham in September and November 2012, and one against Maribor of Slovenia in December. And in May, Boateng, along with Italy striker Mario Balotelli and Ghana international Sulley Muntari, were the targets when a game between AC Milan and Roma was temporarily halted as visiting fans chanted racist abuse at the trio. Balotelli, one of Europe's most high-profile black players, told CNN in an exclusive interview that he would walk off the field if the abuse persisted while Muntari expressed his desire to ""kill"" all racism in the game. They epitomized a new resolve among the game's top players to stamp out discrimination, sparked by Boateng's actions in the small town of Busto Arsizio in the Lombardy region of the country on that January afternoon. Boateng's resolve . His abusers at Pro Patria were recently handed jail sentences ranging from 40 days to two months and Boateng is convinced the past five months are proof that there is hope for the future. ""I'm taking care of these things because I want my son to grow up in a nice place and not in a place where he has to be confronted by racism,"" Boateng explained to CNN. ""But I never ever thought that if something happened like this that I would react the way I did, that was just out of the emotion and anger in that situation. ""I would say that it's there every day. It's still there and that's a big problem, because we are in the year 2013 and we still have to face racism. There are so many people who are fighting it now, and I want to be a part of that. ""I'm very confident. I had so many talks and so much support from people who want to help, who have offered their help."" After years of mixed messages from the top, it appears there is now an appetite to launch an assault on the outdated attitudes that still infiltrate the modern game. But given the recent resurgence of racist incidents in Europe, and the muddled picture in various pockets of the continent, the path towards zero tolerance is sure to prove painstaking. Should the globe's most popular sport manage to forge a way through, perhaps it will be able to point to the events of January 3 as a turning point. As far as Boateng is concerned, had it been a friendly, or one of the planet's most high-profile games his reaction would have been the same. ""I think we should not accept and tolerate racism anywhere, in any game, whether it's a friendly game or a World Cup final or it's a Champions League final,"" he said. ""For me I would honestly do it even if it was a Champions League final.""","Kevin-Prince Boateng's walk-off protest marked pivotal moment in soccer's racism battle .

"New York (CNN) -- A 111-year-old New Yorker who had been certified as the oldest man in the world has died. Alexander Imich died Sunday morning at a senior residence in Manhattan, his niece, Karen Bogen, confirmed to CNN. Imich was certified as the oldest man in the world this April by the Gerontology Research Group of Torrance, California. ""He was remarkable,"" Bogen said. ""He was so independent until very recently, and he just had an incredible curiosity about life."" Imich was born in Poland on February 4, 1903, according to a longtime friend in New York, Michael Mannion. He and his wife, Wela, fled Poland when the Nazis took over, survived a labor camp in Russia and in 1951 moved to the United States, Mannion said. His wife, who was a prolific artist and therapist in New York, died in 1986, according to Bogen. ""His apartment was filled with her artwork,"" she said. They had no children. Mannion told CNN that when Imich learned he was the oldest man in the world, he ""enjoyed the attention."" ""It was his work that he was most proud of, and he was happiest when the attention included his scientific work,"" Mannion said. Despite a doctorate in zoology, Imich's passion was investigating paranormal activity, Mannion said. He detailed his encounters with the supernatural in ""Incredible Tales of the Paranormal,"" a journal that was published when he was 92. While Imich's lengthy life can be attributed to diet, exercise and nutrition, Mannion says his great passion and curiosity for life were the real keys to his longevity. ""He had such an ability to turn adversity into something positive. That intense curiosity was there until the last days,"" said Mannion, who had visited Imich the night before he died. A 116-year-old Japanese woman, Misao Okawa, is the world's oldest living person, according to the Gerontology Research Group. The title of world's oldest man now goes to Sakari Momoi, also of Japan, who was born just a day after Imich in 1903, the group said.

"(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia on Sunday defended its execution of a Sri Lankan maid for the death of an infant in her care and hit back at international criticism of last week's beheading. ""The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia categorically rejects any interference in its affairs or in the provisions of its judiciary under any justifications,"" a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency read. Human rights groups and the Sri Lankan government had lobbied for leniency in the case of Rizana Nafeek, who was convicted of killing her employers' son in 2005. The family said she strangled the boy, Kayed bin Nayef bin Jazyan al-Otaibi, after being asked to bottle-feed him, but Nafeek said the infant accidentally choked on milk. Read more: Outrage over beheading of Sri Lankan woman by Saudi Arabia . She was executed Wednesday amid condemnation by human rights groups, the European Union and the United Nations. But in Sunday's statement, the Saudis said complaints about her execution ""draw on false information about the case and are issued without full knowledge of the circumstances of the case itself."" The Saudi statement denied allegations by Nafeek's advocates that she was a minor at the time of the boy's death. Sri Lanka's government said she was only 17 at the time. But the Saudi statement said her official passport showed she was 21 when the boy died. ""As it is universally recognized, the passport is an official document issued by her government,"" the statement said. ""Moreover, the legal regulations of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia do not allow the recruitment of minors."" Saudi Arabia is a signatory to the international Convention on the Rights of the Child, which bars the execution of offenders who were under 18 at the time of their crime. The Saudis said Nafeek had ""all rights to have a legal defense,"" with the Sri Lankan government monitoring the case. And it said Saudi officials ""at the highest levels"" urged the infant's family members to agree to clemency or a payment of ""blood money"" in exchange for sparing Nafeek's life, but they refused. Opinion: Saudi execution: Brutal, inhuman and illegal? Nafeek was put to death Wednesday in Dawadmi, a small, dusty town about 200 kilometers (125 miles) west of Riyadh. Sri Lanka has withdrawn its ambassador to Saudi Arabia in response to the execution, which Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa had twice asked Saudi King Abdullah to stop. ""We pointed out to Saudi officials that Rizana came to their country as a housemaid. She was not competent or trained to look after a baby, which she had been assigned to her by her employer,"" External Affairs Secretary Karunatilaka Amunugama said in a statement released Friday. Human rights groups said Nafeek did not have access to a lawyer during her pretrial interrogation, during which she said she was assaulted and forced to sign a confession under duress. Philip Luther, director of Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa program, said last week that the case shows the Saudis are ""woefully out of step ... with their international obligations regarding the use of the death penalty."" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was ""dismayed"" by the execution, the United Nations said last week. Amnesty says Saudi Arabia executed at least 79 people in 2012. Of those, 27 were non-Saudis -- and most of the foreigners executed in recent years were migrant workers from developing countries, the group said. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","Saudi Arabia says Rizana Nafeek had ""all rights"" before her beheading last week .

"(CNN) -- If you doubt there's a dental health crisis in America, walk into any emergency room. Every day, thousands of people without access to a dentist are looking for dental care in our ERs, most of which cannot provide the care these patients need. We're experiencing this alarming trend right here in Greensboro, North Carolina. For example, one of our local hospitals, the Moses Cone Health Center, finds that about 10% of ER cases are related to dental issues. Nationally, more than 2.1 million people, the vast majority of them adults, showed up in ERs with dental pain in 2010, double the number just a decade prior, according to the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. Those ER visits for largely preventable issues cost the health system more than $2 billion that year. And the majority of dental ER visits, nearly 80%, were for common and preventable conditions like abscesses and cavities. The reason for this? The percentage of working-age adults -- particularly young adults -- with private dental benefits continues to decline. And more than half of lower-income adults say they haven't seen a dentist in a year or longer. So patients go without proper cleaning and examinations and end up at the ER when a problem strikes. But most ERs are not staffed or equipped to diagnose and treat dental problems. Typically, they provide antibiotics and pain medication only. This results in patients returning to the ER to treat the same dental issues as soon as the pain returns. Unfortunately, the Affordable Care Act will provide little relief. The new law has no substantive dental provisions for low-income adults, despite the fact that dental health is critical to overall health. Dental crisis could create 'State of Decay' What's the solution? Foremost, it's prevention. We need programs to get patients proper preventive care. And when patients have dental issues that need immediate attention, they need access to a dentist to treat the underlying problem. The good news is that we are beginning to tackle this issue, one hospital ER at a time. I've seen it in my hometown of Greensboro, and it may be happening in yours, too. Hospitals and dentists across the country are collaborating on programs that address this issue at the community level, offering models other communities can replicate. Greensboro's Moses Cone Health Center has one such program. Recognizing that dental emergencies are better handled in a dental office, Moses Cone created a program to refer these patients to staff dentists. The hospital covers the cost of care if the patient is uninsured. The end result: The dental patients get the care they need, and the hospital is able to free up the ER staff to handle more urgent emergencies, saving time and money. Other communities are creating their own ER referral programs. At Maine's Waldo County General Hospital, about one in five patient visits to the emergency department involved dental pain. To relieve the strain on its facilities, Waldo County General created an in-house dental clinic that offers screenings and preventive care, with local dentists providing treatments such as fillings and extractions at substantially reduced fees. To qualify, patients must not have seen a dentist in the past 12 months and must meet certain federal income requirements. Most patients pay $10 to $20 for a dental visit, but no one is turned away if they can't. The Bronson Battle Creek hospital system in Calhoun County, Michigan, is partnering with a local nonprofit, Community HealthCare Connections, on a program that refers patients suffering from dental pain from the ER to dentists. Since the program began, dental cases in the ER have dropped by 70%. The dental screening that could save your life . More than 60% of the community's private practice dentists have signed on to provide free treatment, resulting in more than $1 million in care donated to 4,000 people. In return for care, patients volunteer service hours with local organizations, giving back to the surrounding community. All Americans deserve good dental health, and we need more collaborative approaches like these to take on America's dental crisis. That's why dentists are working with health and community leaders across the United States through Action for Dental Health, the American Dental Association's nationwide, community-based movement to provide care now to people suffering with dental disease, strengthen the public-private safety net and bring disease prevention and dental health education into underserved communities. The campaign comprises numerous initiatives, each with specific goals, one of which is to implement ER referral programs in all 50 states by 2020. With bold goals like this and a commitment to join together locally and nationally, we can all but eliminate routine dental problems clogging ERs by providing the right care in the right place: the dental chair. The opinions expressed are solely those of Dr. Charles H. Norman.","Most emergency rooms are not staffed or equipped for dental problems .

"(CNN) -- Australian authorities will announce a new search area Wednesday in the hunt for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, according to the agency overseeing the effort. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau said Sunday it's been re-examining data that could shift the search area hundreds of kilometers south along an arc derived from satellite data. More than three months after Flight 370 disappeared over Southeast Asia, searchers have found no trace of the Boeing 777 or the 239 people aboard, making it one of the biggest mysteries in aviation history. Police: Report about pilot is wrong . Meanwhile, Malaysian police are denying a report in a London newspaper that MH370 pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah is the primary suspect in the probe into the plane's disappearance. The investigation is ""ongoing"" on all angles, with nothing conclusive at this time, Malaysian police spokeswoman Asmawati Ahmad told CNN. ""We did not make any statement to say that Capt. Zaharie was the prime suspect,"" she said, refuting an article in London's The Sunday Times that says Zaharie is now the sole focus of the investigation. The article cites unnamed industry and non-Malaysian government sources familiar with the state of the investigation as claiming that Zaharie is ""the prime suspect if the plane's disappearance turns out to be the result of human intervention."" That conclusion is based on claims that police found Zaharie to be the only member of the flight crew who had made no personal or professional obligations for the future, the report claimed. The story also said evidence from the flight simulator at Zaharie's home showed he had plotted -- but then deleted -- paths to the deep southern Indian Ocean and landings on short runways. But the report notes that investigators have not ruled out the possibility of a mechanical malfunction or terrorism, and acknowledges that the case against Zaharie is based on circumstantial evidence. An FBI review of the two pilots' hard drives, including one in the flight simulator Zaharie had built at his home, had not turned up a ""smoking gun,"" a U.S. official with knowledge of the investigation told CNN in March. What's next . Authorities have not been able to explain why the jet veered dramatically off course during a scheduled flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing on March 8. Hopes of closure for the families of those on board were raised in early April, when a search team in the southern Indian Ocean detected pings that were initially believed to have come from the plane's flight data recorders. But Australian authorities said an exhaustive search of the sea floor around the pings yielded no wreckage and ruled the area out as the aircraft's final resting place. Now, officials are preparing for the next stage of the search. Australia, the closest country to where the plane is believed to have entered the ocean, has said it will delegate the management and operation of the new phase to a private company. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which is leading the search at the request of the Malaysian government, said it is accepting proposals for the task until the end of June. The new search is expected to start in August at the earliest. Outside group tells governments where to search for Flight 370 . A hole in the clouds, an empty space on earth .

"(CNN) -- The current chaos in Iraq is tragic in almost every way. In retrospect, it is easy to conclude Iraq was not nearly ready enough to assume control of its own security situation when the United States made the decision to withdraw forces in December 2011. The wisdom of that decision will long be debated, but having made it, the United States is now understandably reluctant to undo it. Even as the Obama administration sorts through a galaxy of unattractive options, none of which is guaranteed to provide stability, it would be well-advised not to overlook one of the biggest strategic lessons of the Iraqi deterioration. That would be the warning signal it provides for another country headed down the same disturbing path: Afghanistan. While Iraq and Afghanistan are of course vastly different in terms of demographics, history and terrain, the parallels emerging between them in terms of security implications and political process are too important to ignore. An extremist militant group rising quickly and taking over large swaths of the country. A government focusing more on retribution and vengeance than reconciliation and governance. And a supposedly well-trained army essentially disintegrating in the face of real conflict. All of these characteristics describe the situation in Iraq, but all may be equally descriptive of Afghanistan in only a few short years. Similar to Iraq, Afghanistan has an ethnic, well-organized and well-funded insurgent group poised to retake significant amounts of territory once U.S. troops leave. There can be no doubt that the Taliban, having seized power once before in Kabul, is only biding its time until it can do so again. Much like the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the Taliban takes advantage of the limits of federal influence and governs by fear and aggression. It is only a matter of time before the Taliban, newly emboldened by the recent prisoner swap that freed five militants, takes control of southern Afghanistan and challenges Kabul's authority. Compounding this situation is the shaky and corrupted political process under way, which makes Iraq look like a well-functioning democracy. In a variation of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's sectarian tendencies, outgoing Afghan President Hamid Karzai has done little to unite Afghanistan's many tribal factions during his 12 years in office, instead often fomenting discontent. While both of the leading presidential candidates have pledged to focus on unity, there is little reason to believe that either will make it a priority. Ominously, one candidate has already boycotted the electoral process before the results of the June 14 run-off election even being announced. As a result, Afghanistan could become even more politically divided than Iraq is today. Perhaps the biggest wild card in Afghanistan's future is the Afghan National Army. Much like the Iraqi army, the Afghan army will be charged with maintaining the security situation once the United States departs. And much like the Iraqis, the Afghans have been trained by the United States. As we heard in Iraq, the training of the Afghans will be sufficient preparation to defend the country from any threats that may arise. While the Afghans may be courageous soldiers, there have been numerous reports of lackluster performances. So much so that their abilities in actual combat situations remain uncertain. In addition, Afghanistan has never had a real national fighting force, meaning there are few examples and fewer role models for current soldiers to emulate. As a national army, the Afghans came from a much less mature and much less professional starting point than the Iraqis. As illustrated in Iraq, without the right training and leadership, soldiers may not be willing to defend against insurgents, despite an enormous numerical advantage. Given all this, it is not difficult to look at the situation in Iraq and see Afghanistan's future. Indeed, with a resurgent Taliban, political instability in Kabul, an untested army and if the United States continues with its plan to drawdown forces at the end of 2014, especially without an agreement in place for the retention of American security personnel, a future similar to Iraq's may be inevitable. However, unlike Iraq, this bleak Afghan future need not necessarily become reality. The United States still has an opportunity to avoid making the same mistakes it made in Iraq. To accomplish this, the United States needs to redouble its efforts at training the Afghan army to develop it into a legitimate fighting force. It needs to put diplomatic pressure on the new president as soon as he takes office to embark on a unification and reconciliation process. And most important, it needs to plan for a withdrawal based on appropriate benchmarks and conditions, not on a political timetable. Such a change in strategy would undoubtedly be domestically unpopular. But sometimes, unpopularity is a necessary price for avoiding a far worse alternative in the future.

"(CNN) -- When Enric Sala dips his toes in a pool of water, he does so in the knowledge he may well be the first man on the planet to do so. As he lowers himself below the surface of the ocean in his diving gear he becomes something of a fish whisperer, an underwater pied piper. In short, marine life flocks to the pony-tailed Spaniard. ""It's an amazing experience to see fish that have never seen humans,"" he says. ""They come really, really close to us. That's just unthinkable where people are fishing. Normally, we're used to them swimming away from us. ""What we're doing is hard to do almost anywhere in the world. We're seeing large fish and sharks in almost every dive. People could spend years in, say, the Caribbean and see less sharks than we can in just one single dive. This latest trip has been a really, really special experience. It's so wild and we expected to see healthy reefs but not like this."" Sala is a novelty -- well, certainly to sea life -- with his passion for untouched waters as National Geographic's explorer-in-residence, whose mission is to help protect the last wild places in the ocean. The society's ""Pristine Seas"" initiative has been set up to fend off the long-distance fishing fleets that have started to encroach in these remote waters. Just 2% of the world's waters are protected, and Sala knows he has a gargantuan task ahead of him that needs massive backing by the world's governments. Slowly but surely he is chipping away at ensuring a better future for the world's waters. Of the eight areas he has so far visited under the program, four are now protected with a further two currently pending protection. His most recent expedition is to New Caledonia, an archipelago that separated from Australia 60-85 million years ago, coming to rest 1,210 kilometers east, and is now a special collectivity of France at the behest of Napoleon III, who ordered his navy to take formal possession of the 18,500 kmÂ². A day's boat ride north from New Caledonia's most northern tip, the Waitt's Institute research vessel has, until recently, been bobbing for the last three weeks slowly on the water's surface. A team of 12 people, made up of scientists, cameramen and crew, with Sala at the epicenter as expedition leader. Previously an academic, he recalls: ""I was studying the effects of humans on the ocean. It was so depressing. I thought saving the ocean was a lost battle but then I decided I wanted to be part of the solution, so we started the Pristine Seas project. ""Now I feel like there's hope. Now I go to these places and see what it used to be like, to see what the future could be elsewhere with regeneration."" Sala's passion for all things underwater is addictive, he talks with a childlike enthusiasm for his current expedition. He was a boy when first captivated by the magic of the sea, inspired by the famous former diver and explorer Jacques Cousteau. ""Since I can remember, my dream was to be a diver on his boat but I was born too late for that. But now I'm getting to do something similar myself. He showed us a lot and in later years showed us what was wrong with what we were doing. I'm trying to go one step beyond that and find solutions."" So how would his idol have perceived what Sala and his team are now doing? ""I think he would have been proud of what we're doing,"" says Sala, who grew up on the Spanish Mediterranean coast. ""If he had lived on, I think he would have done something like this himself. But he was just an amazing man known by so many people around the world."" Sala's current quest is aimed at not just protecting certain waters but regenerating those that have been fished to within an inch of their lives. The aim is to ensure protected areas become increasingly rich in fish and other underwater life, thereby spilling into other waters as it becomes overly abundant, thus in the long-term having a positive knock-on effect to fishermen. But he and his team are also learning about healthy coral and reef, among other things, to learn how to help regenerate damaged varieties in other global waters. Their days are spent diving, filming, photographing and researching. Sala, indeed, is most at home in the ocean. ""Once in the water, all the problems on the surface disappear,"" he insists. ""You're in a world where you're in complete focus but also at peace. It's a world where you don't feel the strong gravity from the planet, you feel like you're flying. ""It completely changes your perspective on the world. I think it probably helps that endorphins are being released especially in these pristine places. ""Being able to experience nature, and raw nature at that, first hand is like going back in the past. On these trips, it's like I go into a time machine and go back. It's quite spiritual."" Sharks have become synonymous with fear in the sea, thanks in part to Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws"" film with John Williams' ominous stringed musical buildup to each unwitting victim of a shark attack. But Sala's experience of the underwater predators has been the complete antithesis. ""Every moment is wonderful, like spending just one dive following clown fish for the whole dive,"" he says. ""All the animals are special but the most special are sharks. ""They are just so beautiful and elegant in the water. They're perfect in their environment and their shape has not really changed in 300 million years. ""They are also great for the health of the reef, and the idea that they are dangerous is wrong. They have a bad reputation but in my five years doing this, diving sharks, I've not had one problem. I've never once been threatened by sharks."" His long-term aim, and that of National Geographic, is to protect 20 seas in total. So how exactly can you protect large swathes of water? ""It's become much easier as governments who we've worked with pass laws limiting the areas that can be fished,"" he explains. ""Obviously some of these are in remote waters so the best way to do that is via satellite. For example in New Caledonia, we found out that the French Navy had intercepted an illegal Chinese fishing vessel. Having a naval presence is also a great deterrent."" Next on his tick list is Mozambique in April. Slowly, sea by sea he is clearing up the planet's waters, and he is determined to continue.","Enric Sala, National Geographic's explorer-in-residence, is aiming to clean up the seas .

"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN) -- After months of clamoring, the MH370 raw satellite data that families have been demanding may soon be publicized. Until now, Inmarsat, the company whose satellites communicated with the missing plane in its last hours, has said it didn't have the authority to release it. But on Tuesday, Inmarsat and Malaysian authorities said they were trying to make the raw data accessible. ""In line with our commitment towards greater transparency, all parties are working for the release of the data communication logs and the technical description of the analysis for public consumption,"" Inmarsat and the Malaysian aviation officials said in a joint statement. ""It must also be noted that the data communication logs is just one of the many elements of the investigation information,"" the officials said. The statement did not say when the information would be released. But publication of the raw satellite data could allow for independent analysis of what happened on March 8, the day Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared with 239 people on board. Some relatives of passengers weren't sure what to make of the announcement. ""Their intentions have to be backed by actions, so I'd like to wait to see when that really happens,"" said K.S. Narendran, whose wife was on the plane. ""Secondly, it's just one piece of the whole amount of data that has been used to conduct the search,"" Narendran told CNN's Don Lemon. ""So when sharing Inmarsat data by itself is important, I think it will be essential as time goes by for the larger set of data to also be made available."" But CNN aviation analyst Jeff Wise said ""the box is going to open"" when the data gets publicized. ""It could produce more theories. It will probably cancel out a lot of theories,"" he said. Either way, the release will hopefully give ""a much better understanding of what's been going on all this time."" Inmarsat 'working' to make raw MH370 data public . Conflicting accounts . On Monday, Malaysia's acting transportation minister said the government asked Inmarsat to publicize the satellite data. Malaysian officials told CNN last week that their government did not have the raw data. But Inmarsat officials said the company provided all of it to Malaysian officials ""at an early stage in the search."" ""We've shared the information that we had, and it's for the investigation to decide what and when it puts out,"" Inmarsat Senior Vice President Chris McLaughlin said last week. But a senior Malaysian official told CNN that the government needed Inmarsat's help to pass on the data to families ""in a presentable way."" ""We are trying to be as transparent as possible,"" the official said. ""We have no issues releasing the data."" Whenever the information comes out, it may help answer questions by critics who are skeptical about where officials have been searching for the plane. Some scientists studying the disappearance and relatives of those on board have become increasingly critical of the lack of public information about why the search has focused on the southern Indian Ocean.

"(CNN) -- Students at an Indiana high school heavily damaged by a tornado this month will have a private prom party thrown by the country music trio Lady Antebellum, followed by a public concert to raise money for their community. The country music group announced last week that Henryville Junior-Senior High School was the winner of its ""Own the Night"" prom contest based on a video entry submitted by a rival Clark County, Indiana, school. ""Now, don't get me wrong, we would love to have you at our prom, but there's another school in the West Clark family that deserves it more than any other school in the country,"" Silver Creek High School senior Luke Gillenwater said in the winning video. Lady Antebellum was already booked April 27, the night of the Henryville prom, so they set aside May 16 for a prom party in KFC YUM! Center in nearby Louisville, Kentucky, the group said Tuesday. All the money raised from a public concert after the prom party will be donated to a local disaster relief fund, the group said. ""Helping rebuild this community is our biggest priority right now,"" Lady Antebellum's Hillary Scott said. ""We were so moved by the stories from Henryville High School but also from the students at their rival schools who raised their hands and said they wanted to help."" Damage done by the March 2 tornado closed the campus until the fall. Students are scheduled to resume classes April 2 in an industrial building 10 miles away. ""They missed so much with the school being destroyed that things like this help them feel whole again,"" West Clark Community Schools Superintendent Monty Schneider said. ""They will be talking about the tornadoes for the rest of their lives, but this event will give them something positive to reflect on about that time.""

"Washington (CNN) -- ""They deserve a vote."" President Barack Obama made that impassioned argument toward the end of his State of the Union message on Tuesday, using a strong emotional appeal to hammer home his plea for a vote in Congress on several gun control measures. He drew on the spirit of Hadiya Pendleton, the Chicago teenager who was shot dead just a week after performing during the president's inaugural weekend celebration. Her parents were sitting next to first lady Michelle Obama in the House gallery. ""They deserve a vote,"" Obama called out again. He called on the image of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was wounded by a gunman two years ago in Arizona. ""Gabby Giffords deserves a vote,"" he said. But in using passion to push Congress toward action, did the president go too far? And will it work? It might. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a leading Republican and tough Obama critic, told CNN's Jim Acosta that he would not block a vote on gun control in the Senate. ""No, let's vote,"" Graham said. ""I don't disagree with the president to have a debate. Let's vote. Let's find something we can agree on."" West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, a gun enthusiast, also said he would not get in the way of a vote. ""I won't block a vote on anything, whether I support it or not,"" he said. Whether Obama's plea is taken as an effective tactic that will help spur legislative action or is seen as a cheap, emotional ploy designed to push through a one-sided agenda depends on where you fall in the debate, political experts say. What Obama said Tuesday night . ""That's the way to do it. If you don't do that it's not going to happen,"" said Alan Lizotte, dean and professor at the State University of New York at Albany's School of Criminal Justice. ""You bring the families in, you bring in Giffords and it makes the case this needs to do be done,"" Lizotte said. In perhaps the most passionate part of his speech, Obama was also sending a message to voters, who polls have shown are divided over changes in gun law. ""Each of these proposals deserves a vote in Congress. If you want to vote no, that's your choice. But these proposals deserve a vote,"" Obama said. ""Because in the two months since Newtown, more than a thousand birthdays, graduations, and anniversaries have been stolen from our lives by a bullet from a gun,"" he said. Obama pressed on as people stood and applauded and some wiped away tears. One woman clutched a photo of a shooting victim. Graham to Obama: Stop 'cheerleading' for gun laws . Gun control advocates are hoping to capitalize on that emotion. MomsRising, a grassroots organization for mothers, plans on delivering a Valentine's Day petition with more than 150,000 signatures aimed at urging the National Rifle Association and members of Congress to ""to stop blocking commonsense gun regulations."" ""Sandy Hook was a wakeup call for many moms across the nation. ... Moms are so upset by the current state of our gun policy and continue to be upset,"" said Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, executive director and co-founder of the group. The nation's gun lobby and other gun rights advocates said they will work hard to ensure that legislation is considered without the type of emotion on display during the State of the Union address. ""What I want from my legislative policy makers is a serious adult discussion, emotions are very strong and it's not what you want to make decisions on. We did that after 9/11 and we ended up with the Patriot Act,"" said Richard Feldman, who served as regional political director for the NRA during its rise to power in the 1980s and is president of a gun rights group, the Independent Firearm Owners Association. NRA President David Keene was similarly put off by the president's approach. Complete coverage of the gun debate . ""The one thing that sort of upsets me a little bit is the president is trying to use emotion to force things through before they are rationally debated, argued and examined and that's a mistake because that's the way you get to bad policy,"" Keene told CNN following the president's speech. ""There are going to be votes on some of these things. Some of these things may have more support than others and some of them may drop along the way as we head to the final days of this confrontation on second amendment rights,"" he said. Gun rights advocates are also using emotional appeals to make their point. ""Hurricanes. Tornadoes. Riots. Terrorists. Gangs. Lone criminals. These are perils we are sure to face-not just maybe. It's not paranoia to buy a gun. It's survival,"" the NRA's executive vice president Wayne LaPierre wrote in an op-ed published Wednesday by the conservative news website, The Daily Caller. ""It's responsible behavior,"" he continued. ""And it's time we encourage law-abiding Americans to do just that."" Congress is preparing to consider such measures as a ban on the manufacture of new high-powered assault weapons, cracking down on straw purchases of guns for those who can't pass background checks, curbing gun trafficking and expanding background checks. House Speaker John Boehner has said he has no plans to bring any measure up for a vote until the Senate acts first. Republicans oppose any assault weapons ban and rural-state Democrats facing tough re-election fights are unlikely to support it as well, meaning that proposal has little chance of passing Congress. There is some bipartisan support for expanded background checks, especially to keep guns out of the hands of people with mental illness. A number of lawmakers may also support limiting the size of ammunition magazines. The top Democrat in Congress, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, has a good rating from gun rights groups and has said he would work to ensure that a variety of proposals are brought to the floor for consideration. Gun focus shifts from ban to checks and trafficking . To that end, the emotional nature of the president's address could help Democrats who are in a difficult position on Obama's push for Congress to at least vote on tougher gun laws. The call places pressure on congressional Democrats, particularly in the House who may find that support of tougher gun laws could make it hard for them in the 2014 mid-term election. But bucking the party could anger the Democratic base. ""I think that the emotional appeal in the State of the Union speech can be important for elected officials who have to appeal to a jurisdiction that is not overwhelmingly Republican,"" said Daniel Webster, director of Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. ""I have some confidence that there will be support in the Senate, including from several Democrats in states with large populations who are gun owners, for passing universal background checks, funding to encourage better reporting to the NICS (National Instant Criminal Background Check System) mental health disqualifications, and measures to strengthen laws that can be used to prosecute and deter illegal gun trafficking,"" Webster said. However getting such legislation past the House is another matter. ""I am less optimistic about these things in the House because the Republican party has so few moderates, most are in safe gerrymandered districts, and the NRA provides critical funding and grassroots resources,"" Webster said. ""But I suspect that the party will take a hit politically if they have a deaf ear to the country's cry for much needed reforms."" Gun violence plans: What's in the works . CNN's Jim Acosta contributed to this report .","Some embrace President Obama's appeal for gun control vote; others turned off .

"(CNN) -- France's history at major tournaments recently suggests no one should be calling ""Les Bleus"" title contenders at this year's World Cup just yet but after Friday's game against Switzerland even the team's harshest critics must be optimistic. France crushed Switzerland 5-2 in Salvador and almost booked its spot in the second round with two wins from as many games in Group E. The last time the French went 2-0 to start a World Cup, it won the title on home soil in 1998. Now that's a good omen. Things could still go wrong, however. Look at the European Championships two years ago, when Laurent Blanc led a long unbeaten French side to Poland and Ukraine. Still unbeaten and already qualified for the quarterfinals with a game to spare, France came unstuck in a dead rubber against Sweden and subsequently crumbled against Spain. The infighting, present in South Africa in 2010, resurfaced. Current French boss Didier Deschamps -- Blanc's teammate on the World Cup winning squad -- is so far managing to keep the side unified and has found a way to unlock striker Karim Benzema. Benzema netted twice against Honduras in the opening 3-0 victory and scored again against the fragile Swiss, adding two assists. France threatened to score almost every time it went forward. Striker Olivier Giroud was hoping for a start against the Swiss and Deschamps duly inserted the Arsenal man into the lineup. He repaid his manager with a header in the 17th minute and less than a minute later, the French realistically put the Swiss away as Blaise Matuidi beat keeper Diego Benaglio with a low shot to the near post. It would have been three had Benzema not seen his penalty saved by Benaglio. The football was still free flowing and it came as no surprise when Giroud set up Mathieu Valbuena from close range in the 40th minute. Benzema made it four in the 67th minute before Moussa Sissoko further humbled the Swiss six minutes later. Two Swiss goals in the final 10 minutes made the score respectable. Blerim Dzemaili beat Hugo Lloris with a low free kick in the 81st minute and Granit Xhaka cut the deficit to three in the 87th. Those goals could be pivotal for the Swiss given goal difference is the first criteria to separate teams when tied in the standings. Thus, when Benzema had a goal disallowed because the final whistle blew, there was more relief for Switzerland. Switzerland remains on three points, while Ecuador rose to three and leapfrogged Switzerland on goal difference by later defeating Honduras 2-1. Valencia shines . With both teams realistically needing a win to progress to the next round, the first half between Ecuador and Honduras was messy but delightfully end-to-end in Curitiba. Enner Valencia spurned a chance early for the South Americans and Honduras celebrated wildly when Carlo Costly scored his team's first goal at a World Cup in 32 years with a low finish near the edge of the box. Instead of holding firm, though, Honduras quickly conceded in the 34th minute to reawaken Ecuador. Valencia, Ecuador's talisman, was the quickest to react at the far post and poked the ball home from a few yards out as he scored in a sixth consecutive game for his country. Honduras' burly central defender Victor Bernardez stung the palms of keeper Alexander Dominguez with an impressive long-range free kick just before halftime and Costly's header struck the bar in stoppage time. The ball went into the net on a rebound, though the officials rightly ruled that Jerry Bengtson used his arm to score. After the interval, Felipe Caicedo seemed to be fouled by Honduras' Maynor Figueroa in the box but the referee signaled play to continue. Honduras had another goal disallowed thanks to offside and Valencia soared above the defense to deposit his winning header home from Walter Ayovi's pinpoint free kick in the 65th. Costly narrowly missed latching on to a low cross and Figueroa's shot from distance wasn't far off but Ecuador hung on. Although France is in pole position and Honduras needs a minor miracle to advance, nothing officially has been decided in the group. France plays Ecuador and Switzerland plays Honduras on Wednesday.","France takes command of Group E by crushing Switzerland 5-2 in Salvador .

"(CNN) -- Vincent ""Buddy"" Cianci has been mayor of Providence, Rhode Island -- twice. Both times, he left under a dark cloud after being convicted of crimes he committed while in office. Now, he wants back in. Cianci announced Wednesday on his weekday radio show that he intends to seek a third go as the mayor of Rhode Island's capital and biggest city, feeling he's the best bet for Providence's future regardless of his own past. ""Today with a sense of humility, contrition and confidence I announce to you my candidacy for mayor of Providence,"" the 73-year-old Cianci said on WPRO 630. He was an Army veteran and prosecutor when he became mayor the first time in 1975, quickly establishing himself as a character and significant actor in the New England city. Things came tumbling down in 1983, when he was indicted for extortion, assault with a dangerous weapon, kidnapping, conspiracy and simple assault. That stemmed from an incident that year at his Providence home, in which he used his hands and a lit cigarette to assault a man he accused of having an affair with his estranged wife, with a uniformed policeman nearby -- an account detailed in court records and documented by then-Providence Journal reporter Mike Stanton. He pleaded nolo contendere, or no contest, the following year to one count of assault with a dangerous weapon and one count of simple assault, according to court documents. As part of the plea deal, Cianci never went to prison -- getting five years of probation on the assault with a dangerous weapon charge and one year's probation on the simple assault charge -- but was forced to leave his job as mayor. Still, Cianci didn't go away completely. He remained very much a part of the Providence landscape and a fixture on talk radio. And soon after his probation was over, Cianci was elected mayor once again. He stayed in that position for 11 more years, continuing to push the redevelopment and becoming a celebrity of sorts -- with a signature marinara sauce and guest spots on the NBC show ""Providence."" But Cianci's tenure in office ended abruptly, as part of what was known as Operation Plunder Dome. That led to his conviction in 2002 on federal corruption charge, earning him a sentence of five years and four months in prison, plus two years probation and a $100,000 fine. At his sentencing, U.S. District Judge Ernest Torres credited the then-mayor's ""rare vision and boundless energy"" and his ""great role in the renaissance of the city."" ""It is not an understatement to say that this is Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,"" Torres added, saying it was his job to sentence ""Mr. Hyde."" Reflecting on his past Wednesday, Cianci told CNN affiliate WPRI. ""I understand it comes with baggage, but I think people have to take you for who you are. ""They know me from head to toe. They know my faults."" Cianci joins six other candidates aiming for the office. ""There are some of you that may say that this is an 11th hour decision but I assure you it was not made irrationally or in haste,"" said Cianci."" Rather it has been conceived with much soul searching and reflection."" During his announcement on Wednesday, Cianci acknowledged that he will be scrutinized for this decision and even hinted at his previous experiences as his foundation for being a worthy candidate. ""Experience is a great teacher, but often a painful one,"" he said.","Vincent ""Buddy"" Cianci has had two runs as mayor of Providence, Rhode Island .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- The Iraqi government claimed gains in its fight against militants Tuesday, a day full of dizzying developments. The quick advance by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has seen large portions of northern Iraq fall under its control. ISIS wants to establish a caliphate, or Islamic state, that would stretch from Iraq into northern Syria. Here's a look at the latest: . U.S. military advisers arrive in Iraq . Ninety U.S. military advisers arrived in Iraq on Tuesday as part of the mission President Barack Obama announced last week, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said. Those troops will join 40 other U.S. service members, who were already in Iraq working at the embassy in Baghdad and have been reassigned to this new mission, he said. U.S. military personnel are supposed to assess the situation on the ground and then ""advise and assist"" Iraqi military forces as they try to counter the threat from ISIS militants, Kirby said. Fight for Baiji oil refinery . Iraqi security forces are still fighting ISIS and allied Sunni insurgents at the Baiji oil refinery, Hussain al-Shahristani, the deputy prime of energy affairs, said in a statement released Tuesday. He refuted Arab and Western reports that the oil refinery had fallen into the hands of ISIS, saying they were spreading propaganda for ISIS. Late Monday, three separate security sources told CNN that ISIS fighters were in control of the Baiji refinery, the sprawling complex that provides much of the fuel needed for domestic consumption. Iraq's military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Qassim Atta, told reporters in Baghdad on Tuesday morning that the military was in control of the refinery, a claim that was also carried by state-run Iraqiya TV. The claim comes a day after Atta told reporters that fighters had launched a new attack and were using bulldozers as they advanced. He said the advance was repelled and fighters sustained losses. State-run TV reported Iraqi special forces involved in the fight for the refinery killed a militant leader called Abu Qatada. It offered no evidence of the death, nor did it detail how he was killed. CNN cannot independently confirm any of the claims. The competing claims follow days of reports of a seesaw battle for control of the refinery complex in northern Salaheddin province, about 193 kilometers (120 miles) north of Baghdad. Kidnapped Indian workers freed . Seventeen Indian workers kidnapped by ISIS in Iraq have been freed, according to India's External Affairs Ministry. ""Heading home! 17 Indians rescued in Iraq from conflict zone were brought to Baghdad and now are heading home,"" the ministry said in a post on Twitter. Kirkuk city council leader killed . The head of the Kirkuk city council, Munir Kafili, was killed Tuesday when gunmen shot him, police officials told CNN. Kafili, a minority Turkmen, was driving his car in southern Kirkuk when gunmen opened fire, they said. Kirkuk is an ethnically mixed city, with a population of Sunni, Shiite, Kurds and Turkmen, located about 260 kilometers north of Baghdad. 10,000 ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria . The United States calculates there are up to 10,000 ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria, including those who broke out of prisons in Iraq and Sunni tribesmen, several U.S. officials have told CNN in recent days. It is unknown how many are in Iraq versus Syria because it's not clear how many go back and forth across the border and how many loyalists joined ISIS as it took over various towns in Iraq, the officials say. The belief is ISIS is currently functioning as an ""increasingly capable military force"" with ""capability and dexterity,"" one official said. One crucial question is whether they will be able to hold onto both new territory and past gains as they take more territory and are ""stretched"" thin. The answer lies, officials say, in whether the current support of some Sunnis is a so-called marriage of convenience or a long-term partnership even though the Sunni tribes, to a large extent, do not support the ISIS agenda. Senior ISIS figures killed? Two senior ISIS figures -- an Algerian militant named Abu Omar al-Baghdadi and Abu Hafsa, the self-styled governor of Tikrit and Salaheddin provinces -- were killed late Monday in airstrikes in Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit, Sabah Al-Nouman, a spokesman for Iraq's counterterrorism service, told CNN on Tuesday. Al-Nouman offered no evidence of the deaths, and CNN cannot independently confirm the claim. ISIS fighters seized Tikrit during its lightning advance in northern Iraq earlier this month. The Iraqi military began an offensive against Tikrit on Sunday, according to reports on Iraqiya TV. Government paychecks . Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's government announced Tuesday that it will pay government employees who live in ""unstable areas"" under the control of Iraqi security forces, according to a statement released by the Cabinet. Those living in areas ""outside of government control"" will still be paid, but their paychecks will be held and released when military operations end, it said. The Cabinet, according to the statement, has decided to given an ""open holiday"" to government employees who live in areas under the complete control of ISIS fighters and allied Sunni militants. Civilian deaths climb . At least 757 civilians were killed and 599 were injured during the al Qaeda splinter group's advance in northern Iraq between June 5 and 22, according to figures released by the United Nations mission in Iraq. The number of casualties ""should be viewed very much as a minimum,"" and it includes verified summary executions and extra-judicial killings of civilians, police and soldiers, UNAMI said. The casualties occurred in Nineveh, Diyala and Salaheddin provinces, the agency said. At least another 318 people were killed, and a further 590 injured during the same period in Baghdad and areas in the south, many of them as a result of at least six separate car bombs, the agency added. Military spokesman: Iraq regains control of two border crossings . Atta, Iraq's military spokesman, said Iraqi security forces have regained control of two key border crossings after briefing losing them. In a briefing aired on state TV, Atta said Iraqi forces, with the help of Sunni local tribes, retook al-Walid, a border town that connects Iraq with Syria. He also said Iraqi forces have retaken the Trebil bordering crossing between Iraq and Jordan. Atta also said Iraqi forces controlled the area between Samarra and the northern border of Baghdad. He also said fighting continues in northern Babylon province, south of Baghdad, with ISIS elements. Atta did not detail the fighting nor did he say when it started. He offered no evidence of the claims, and CNN cannot independently confirm the report. CNN's Barbara Starr and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","The United States calculates there are up to 10,000 ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria .

"(CNN) -- Once ""the Special One,"" Jose Mourinho now calls himself ""the Happy One"" -- but his much-hyped first press conference back at Chelsea revealed that his new character may well be ""the Stable One."" Nine years and a day after he was first unveiled at the English Premier League club as the brightest coaching talent in world football, Mourinho returned to London after what he described as the worst season of his career in Spain with Real Madrid. He has signed a four-year contract, but has never lasted that long at any club he has managed despite winning multiple national titles and two European crowns. ""Yes. Now I am prepared for that because, to be fair, before I wasn't,"" the 50-year-old told some 250 gathered reporters Monday when asked if he was ready to stay for a long period. ""I was in a position to say which league I prefer, which one is the club I prefer, which one is the mentality I prefer. ""So now it's up to me to work hard and show my club that I deserve to be here for a long time. I have a contract for four years and I hope to go to the last day of that and if the club then wants to keep me, I'll be happy."" Although some key players remain at Stamford Bridge from his first reign, Chelsea has experienced a big turnover of staff since Mourinho left ""by mutual consent"" in 2007 -- having eight different managers in that time. Three members of the club's coaching setup then are now managers at EPL clubs: Tottenham's Andre Villas-Boas, West Brom's Steve Clarke and Liverpool's Brendan Rodgers. ""I found a much better club in different areas, but there is stability needed in football terms,"" Mourinho said. He insisted he did not fall out with Chelsea's billionaire Russian owner Roman Abramovich when he departed six years ago, and that they still have a good relationship. ""I read and I keep hearing that I was fired, I was sacked, we had a complete breakdown of our relationship -- that was not true,"" he said. ""Many didn't believe that but it was a mutual agreement. We thought it was best for both of us, for me and the club. ""Only because there was never a breakdown of the relationship is it possible for me to be here today. I think I'm back because we are in the best moments of our careers and ready to work together again. ""There are much better conditions at this time to succeed and have what we want, stability."" After leaving Chelsea, Mourinho won two Italian Serie A titles and the European Champions League with Inter Milan, which he described Monday as ""probably the best moment of my career."" He refused to dwell on the controversies of his three years at Madrid, where he broke Barcelona's dominance by winning the La Liga title in 2011-12 with a record points and goal tally but failed to win over the local media after dropping World Cup-winning goalkeeper Iker Casillas. ""It was a football decision, I decided for one player and not the other and it is up to the player to accept it or not,"" Mourinho said. ""All my decisions are based on meritocracy, then I can sleep well."" Mourinho was called the ""scourge of Spanish football"" by Barcelona's vice-president and was also criticized by players such as Andres Iniesta, having controversially poked his finger in the eye of coach Tito Vilanova and presided during some ugly, ill-tempered matches between the two teams. ""I 'damaged' Spanish football by being the manager who broke Barcelona dominance,"" he said. ""It looked like a dominance without an end but Real Madrid won the cup final against Barcelona, won the Super Cup against Barcelona, won in Barcelona and won the championship."" Real could not win a 10th European title, though Mourinho guided ""Los Blancos"" to three successive Champions League semifinals after several seasons of waiting to reach even the last eight. He said Chelsea would not be fixated on winning the Champions League, having already done so for the first time last year. ""Chelsea focus on every competition -- I can't say one is more important than another one. In this moment the Champions League can't be an obsession for me. It's not an obsession for Chelsea. It's a consequence of our work."" Mourinho refused to criticize Chelsea's outgoing manager Rafael Benitez for his decision to sparingly use the club's longtime captain John Terry last season. ""I won't speak one word about Rafael Benitez's decisions, either on John Terry or any other player, all I can speak about is the future and the future is to meet John on July 1 and try to get the best out of him,"" said the Portuguese, who had a prickly relationship with the Spaniard when he was at Liverpool. ""I know what he can give, so let's try to make him again the best player he can be."" Just as Casillas was not guaranteed a place in his team, Mourinho said veteran stars such as Terry and Frank Lampard could expect no favors. ""It is important for me to tell you that there is no privilege for them. They know that already as they know my nature as a manger."" Mourinho had been linked with the managerial jobs at Manchester United and Manchester City, but David Moyes has replaced Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford and Manuel Pellegrini is expected to take over from Roberto Mancini. ""I am where I want to be. I wouldn't change it for anything,"" he said. ""I am the happy one. I am very happy. A lot of things happened in my professional life in the last nine years, but I have the same nature, I am the same person, I have the same heart, I have the same kind of emotions related to my passion for football and my job, but I am a different person in this moment. ""If I have to describe myself, I would describe myself as a very happy person because it's the first time I arrive in a club where I already love the club.""","Jose Mourinho says he is looking for stability as he returns to Chelsea after six years away .

"(CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday again called for Russia to de-escalate the situation in Ukraine and warned of further isolation and ""costs"" if Moscow doesn't respond to the West's call for a change of course. The United States and Europe are united in their support for Ukraine, including the need for economic assistance, and in their efforts to isolate Russia for its intervention in Crimea, Obama said, speaking at an European Union-U.S. summit in Brussels, Belgium. He left the door open for diplomacy to resolve the situation but said Russia would face increasing isolation and deeper sanctions if it engages in further incursions into Ukraine. ""If anyone in the Russian leadership thought the world wouldn't care about their actions in Ukraine or that they could drive a wedge between the European Union and the United States, they clearly miscalculated,"" Obama said. The United States and Europe recognize that sanctions could have wider global implications, especially for those countries reliant on Russian oil and natural gas, Obama said. But discussions are under way on making it easier to export U.S. natural gas to Europe, as well as on other trade issues, he said. Russia's intervention in Ukraine's Crimea region has sparked the biggest East-West confrontation since the end of the Cold War. And at a later speech in Brussels, Obama said Russia's annexation of Crimea must be met with condemnation -- ""not because we're trying to keep Russia down, but because the principles that have meant so much to Europe and the world must be upheld."" Meanwhile, Moscow's massing of troops near Ukraine's eastern borders has worried the interim government in Kiev and caused ripples of concern in other former Soviet republics that now belong to the EU and NATO. NATO's top commander has voiced worries that Russian troops could roll into Moldova's separatist region Transnistria, on the opposite side of Ukraine, and Russia fought a brief war with the former Soviet republic of Georgia about five years ago. Russia gearing up for next move, U.S. says . A new U.S. intelligence assessment concludes that a Russian incursion into eastern Ukraine is more likely than previously thought, CNN has learned. U.S. officials believe the Russian buildup gives Moscow the ability to move rapidly into Ukraine without the United States being able to predict it when it happens. Two Obama administration officials described the classified assessment to CNN but declined to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the information. The officials emphasize that nothing is certain, but in the last three to four days, there have been several worrying signs. ""This has shifted our thinking that the likelihood of a further Russian incursion is more probable than it was previously thought to be,"" one official said. The Russian buildup is reminiscent of Moscow's military moves before it went into Chechnya and Georgia in both the number of units and their capabilities, the official said. Crimea is currently separated from the rest of Russia by a strait that links the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. U.S. officials believe Russia might decide to go into eastern Ukraine to establish a land bridge into the territory by moving toward the Ukrainian cities of Kharkiv, Luhansk and Donetska. Russian forces are currently positioned in and around Rostov, Kursk and Belgorod, according to U.S. intelligence information. The estimated 30,000 troops are ""significantly more"" than what is needed for the military exercises Russia says it has been conducting, and there is no sign the troops are making any move to return to their home bases. They include large numbers of motorized units that are capable of moving quickly, and additional contingents -- special forces, airborne troops, air transport -- appear to be at a higher state of mobilization in other locations in Russia, according to the intelligence assessment. Additional intelligence suggests that more Russian forces are ""reinforcing"" the border region, according to both Obama administration officials. Russian troops already in the border region include air defense artillery and wheeled vehicles, and all the troops are positioned for potential military action. U.S. military and intelligence officials have been briefing Congress on the new assessment. As a result, Republican members of the House Armed Services Committee late Wednesday sent a classified letter to the White House expressing concern about unfolding developments. An unclassified version obtained by CNN says committee members feel ""urgency and alarm, based on new information in the committee's possession."" The committee says there is ""deep apprehension that Moscow may invade eastern and southern Ukraine, pressing west to (Transnistria) and also seek land grabs in the Baltics."" Gen. Philip Breedlove, head of the U.S. European Command and military chief of NATO, noted the Russians had sufficient forces to move into Moldova. But Obama warned Russia on Wednesday that it faces a united front in the West. 'Serious consequences' Speaking alongside Obama, European Council President Herman Van Rompuy also struck a note of unity, saying Europe and the United States ""have a strong and coordinated position"" on Ukraine. Russia's annexation of Crimea is ""a disgrace in the 21st century, and we will not recognize it,"" he said. Europe also stands by Georgia and Moldova, Van Rompuy said, and has brought forward the signing of association documents with them to June, bringing the prospect of closer ties to Europe. Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, said the United States and EU ""are working together to make sure that actions that are unacceptable will bear serious consequences."" Russia insists its actions are legitimate and denies having used its armed forces in Crimea, saying the troops that took control of key installations there were local ""self-defense"" forces. Russia also insists the government in Kiev is illegitimate because ousted President Viktor Yanukovych, a close ally of Moscow's, was forced out in an armed coup. Yanukovych's ouster followed months of street protests sparked by his decision to ditch an EU trade deal in favor of closer ties to Russia. In an interview Tuesday with PBS, acting Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said Ukraine is struggling to maintain a fighting capability after it was ""deliberately dismantled"" under Yanukovych. He said his government ceded Crimea without a shot to demonstrate to the world that Russia was the aggressor, he said. But if Moscow moves against another portion of Ukraine, ""We will fight."" Moscow tightens grip . The United States and EU are seeking to exert pressure on Russia through a combination of sanctions and diplomatic isolation. An EU-Russia summit has been canceled, and the G7 group of leading industrialized countries has excluded Russia from what was the G8. The G7 will meet in June in Brussels, instead of attending a planned G8 summit in the Russian city of Sochi. But Moscow has so far doggedly pursued its own course, even as Western leaders have denounced its actions as violations of Ukraine's sovereignty and a breach of international law. Russia has cited the need to protect ethnic Russians within Ukraine from ultra-nationalists and ""fascists"" as a justification for intervention on Ukrainian soil. Hundreds of supporters and paramilitary militia members came out into the streets of Ukraine's western city of Rivne on Wednesday as a funeral was held for a prominent far-right activist, Oleksandr Muzychko, better known as Sashko Biliy. He was killed late Monday in what the Ukrainian Interior Ministry said was a shootout with police in Rivne. Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksandr Doniy, whose constituency is in Rivne, gave a different version of events, saying the activist was dragged into a car and then shot. Muzychko, a leader of Right Sector, a far-right group prominent in the recent anti-government protests, was wanted ""for his criminal background and illegal carrying of weapons,"" the ministry said. Amid the heightened tensions, the Russian Foreign Ministry on Wednesday accused the Ukrainian border service of refusing to let air crew off Aeroflot jets for rest periods after landing in Ukraine. Aeroflot is the Russian national carrier. This ""breaks the international acts in compliance with flight safety requirements,"" the ministry said in an online statement. Crimea, Russia ties . Crimea belonged to Russia until 1954, when it was given to Ukraine, which was then part of the Soviet Union. The region has a majority ethnic Russian population and other historic ties to Russia. A large majority of its population voted in favor of joining Russia in a controversial referendum 10 days ago. Russian lawmakers in turn swiftly voted to absorb the Black Sea peninsula, where Russia has a major naval base, into the Russian Federation, and President Vladimir Putin signed the treaty into law.

"Istanbul (CNN) -- The Turkish prime minister huddled Wednesday with a special Syrian envoy in an effort to help stem the growing tide of refugees racing into Turkey from conflict-wracked Syria. The number of Syrians who have crossed the border stood at 8,421 Wednesday morning, according to Turkey's disaster and emergency management directorate. Their flight has been spurred by violence and a military offensive in the country, and Turkish officials are worried that the border crisis could deteriorate and destabilize the region. World powers have been outraged at the violence, and at least 54 countries are backing a tough resolution on Syria that was to be issued Wednesday at the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland. ""It is impossible for us to remain indifferent to the developments there,"" Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said. ""For us, the Syrians are people who have common future and destiny with us. Therefore, it is out of question to close the door to our Syrian brothers or the (refugee numbers) to stop after 10,000. However, when this turns into a big wave, it also has the potential to become a regional and an international matter."" Syrian security personnel have been carrying out a fierce crackdown against anti-government demonstrators over the past three months. In its draft joint statement about Syria, the U.N. Human Rights Council noted that more than 1,000 people ""peacefully protesting for democracy"" have been killed. ""The continued violence, multiday curfews and military lockdowns are restricting access to basic goods and services, such as health care, medicines and food, causing great concern for the situation of children, the elderly, the sick and wounded, as well as refugees and other vulnerable groups. Injured and wounded people must be allowed to seek treatment without fear of reprisals,"" it said. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan met for nearly three hours with the envoy, who was expected to provide an assessment of the refugee situation and the wider political unrest in Syria, according to an official from Erdogan's office. The envoy represented Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and the meeting followed a telephone conversation Erdogan and al-Assad had Tuesday. Davutoglu, who spoke at the airport in Ankara before flying to Hatay for a visit with the refugees, said Turkey hopes to initiate reforms that would alleviate the volatile conditions leading to the flight of ordinary citizens. He planned to attend the meeting between Erdogan and the Syrian envoy after his visit to Hatay. Davutoglu said that ""escalating violence can increase the refugee wave"" and that Turkey is working on ways ""to prevent escalation of violence."" His government touts a foreign policy dubbed ""no problems,"" a strategy intended to promote good relations with its neighbors. That policy has been challenged by the Syrian situation. Turkey fears a repeat of the enormous Kurdish refugee exodus from northern Iraq in 1991, and the country has spent the past decade promoting warm relations and lucrative economic ties with Syria's al-Assad. But over the past month, Erdogan began calling for reform in Damascus in a bid to curb the escalating violence. ""We hope that Syria changes its attitude toward the civilians to a more tolerant one and realize its steps for reform in a more convincing way for the civilians,"" Erdogan said last week, according to the semi-official Anatolia news agency. Davutoglu said Turkey's ""wish and effort is for a process to begin at once that can prevent such a wave to continue increasingly."" He pointed to ""reforms to be made as soon as possible, conditions to be eliminated that bring security forces and people against each other and to have a more peaceful approach, beyond focusing on security, in the attitude towards the civilian people. If all these were provided, the refugee wave would lessen."" Of the refugees, 4,368 are children, and 73 Syrians are now being treated in Turkish hospitals, the emergency directorate said. More than 1,230 tents have been set up in a number of locations. Turkish Foreign Ministry officials confirmed that they accepted an application for actress Angelina Jolie to visit the Syrian refugees in Hatay. The actress, a goodwill ambassador for the U.N. refugee agency, is expected to arrive in Istanbul and then head Friday to Hatay. Many displaced Syrians have fled toward the border but have not made it over. CNN's Arwa Damon met with some of them at a makeshift campsite Tuesday in Syria, where they described primitive conditions at the site and frightening and deadly violence in the towns that they left. Many of the refugees have fled from a region that includes the northwestern town of Jisr al-Shugur, seized by the Syrian military over the weekend, a network of human rights activists said. The Syrian government insists that it is stopping ""armed terrorist groups"" who carried out a ""massacre"" in the city: the killing 120 members of the security forces. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said Wednesday that one of its correspondents is reporting a ""new mass grave"" in Jisr al-Shugur ""containing bodies belonging to police and security forces"" slain by ""armed terrorist groups."" Opposition activists say the government's claims are a ruse to justify a crackdown on demonstrators demanding government reform, in keeping with the wave of political protests across the Middle East and North Africa this year. But Syrian refugees who have fled to Turkey said some Syrian soldiers rebelled after being ordered to fire on unarmed protesters and instead started fighting among themselves. Syria's cabinet on Tuesday hailed efforts by the army and security forces to restore calm in the Jisr al-Shugur area and surrounding villages, according to the SANA. Adnan Mahmoud, the information minister, said the Cabinet urged citizens ""who were forced to leave their homes to come back after calm and security were restored in the area,"" SANA said. SANA later reported that thousands of Jisr al-Shugur residents had ""returned to their houses after the army restored security and tranquility to the city."" The minister said the cabinet ""assigned the Syrian Arab Red Crescent to contact the Turkish Red Crescent for cooperation to facilitate the Syrian citizens' return to their homes, noting that all necessary needs will be provided to secure the return, including medical aid for the patients and the injured."" Wissam Tarif, a human rights activist based outside Syria, said he had not received reports of people returning to their homes. His contacts told him that military deployments were in villages around the city of Jisr al-Shugur, and army vehicles nearby in the village of al-Jandouwiye. Tarif said he had received no report that the people of Jisr al-Shugur were returning to their homes. As many as 800 people were detained in the past few days in the towns of Douma, Saqba and Daraya, either in raids on homes or at military checkpoints, Tarif said. He also reported the defection of an unspecified number of Syrian troops in Homs. In its joint draft joint statement on Syria, the Human Rights Council called on Syria to implement reforms and end censorship and restrictions on media. ""Arbitrary arrests, detention and torture, including of protestors, of human rights defenders, of representatives of the media, political dissidents, and young children must cease immediately,"" the statement said.

"(CNN) -- Brazil's World Cup has been a carnival of color -- but this was a monochrome affair in Fortaleza. A dour goalless draw against Mexico is unlikely to prevent the host nation from qualifying for the next stage but this game will soon be forgotten. Even with Neymar at the helm, the face of Brazil's World Cup challenge, it rarely looked like finding a way past a determined and stubborn Mexican side. And when Brazil did managed to create a chance, it found Mexico goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa in irrepressible form. ""There was a chance here, a chance there, it was very tight,"" Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari told reporters. ""It wasn't a question of us evolving or not (from the last game). We've been playing this way for 20 games, we are up against good teams, we need to understand that. ""It wasn't a good result, a victory would have qualified us. We need to respect other teams."" After the thrilling excitement of the last week's 3-1 win over Croatia, those packed into the stadium in Fortaleza may have expected another action-packed affair. Instead, what transpired was a rather turgid affair as Brazil failed to find the fluency which eventually put Croatia to the sword in Sao Paulo. Mexico, winners in its opening game against Cameroon, showed little sign of being overawed by the occasion and came close to opening the scoring when Hector Herrera's effort was tipped away by Julio Cesar. It wasn't until midway through the first half that Brazil fashioned a real opportunity -- but when it came it needed a wonderful save by Ochoa to keep Mexico level. Dani Alves, sporting his freshly sprayed silver hairstyle, escaped down the right and his cross was headed towards goal by Neymar only for Ochoa to scramble across goal and tip the ball away. With the first half drawing to a close, Brazil once again carved open the Mexican defense. A free kick into the penalty area was chested down by Thiago Silva into the path of David Luiz but his effort was blocked by the onrushing Ochoa. Whatever coach Luiz Felipe Scolari said at the interval appeared to galvanize the host nation for a few minutes at least with substitute Bernard, on in place of Ramires, adding a new found impetus. It was Bernard who created the opening chance of the half, crossing for Neymar at the far post only for the ball to be taken off the forward's toes by a Mexican defender. But any hopes that Brazil would begin to grow into the contest appeared unfounded. Instead, it was Mexico which looked the more threatening of the two teams with Oribe Peralta and Giovani Dos Santos both roaming menacingly towards the Brazilian goal. But while Neymar remained on the field, Brazil still possessed a man capable of producing magic. It was the 22-year-old who was denied by Ochoa once again, this time the Mexican blocking Neymar's fierce drive from inside the penalty area. Brazil, having replaced the anonymous Fred with substitute Jo, began to crank up the pressure with Mexico visibly beginning to tire. Unbeaten in its previous 38 matches on home soil, Brazil rarely looked like losing but nor did it appear able to find that elusive goal. That frustration was increased with five minutes remaining when Thiago Silva's powerful header was blocked on the line by Ochoa with the Brazilian captain looking certain to score. Marcelo, the left-back, then embarrassed himself by attempting to gain a late penalty with a dive which won him few admirers. Raul Jimenez went close at the other end, forcing Cesar into a smart save as both side's failed to find a breakthrough. Brazil's next game takes place on June 23rd against Cameroon while Mexico will take on Croatia.","Brazil held to goalless draw by Mexico .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Turkey ordered the expulsion of Israel's ambassador and other senior diplomats stationed there on Friday, a dramatic slap against its one-time close ally over its failure to apologize for a deadly raid last year on a Gaza-bound ship in a flotilla loaded with humanitarian aid. Low-level officials are allowed to stay, but others must leave by Wednesday, a Turkish official said. Turkey has been incensed with Israel after its commandos clashed with Turks on one of the flotilla ships, the Mavi Marmara, and killed nine people. This comes on the same day that U.N. released a report about the May 2010 raid. The document criticized Israel's actions in the incident, even as it describes the Israeli naval blockade of Gaza as a ""legitimate security measure."" Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon received a copy of the report on Friday, a U.N. spokesman said. Eduardo del Buey, deputy spokesman for Ban, said the secretary-general regretted that the report did not bridge the gap between Turkey and Israel. Victoria Nuland, spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, echoed that sentiment. ""We hope they will continue to look for opportunities to improve their long-standing relationship, and we will encourage both to work towards that end,"" she said. Israel expressed its sorrow at the loss of life, but said it ""will not apologize for its soldiers taking action to defend their lives. As any other state, Israel has the right to defend its civilians and soldiers."" Israel's blockade of Gaza is designed to prevent weapons from being smuggled to the territory, which is controlled by the anti-Israeli group Hamas. Gaza-based militants have been firing rockets into southern Israel and Israel has responded with military might. But Turkey has been strongly opposed to the Jewish state's naval blockade of the Palestinian territory of Gaza because, an official said, Palestinians have suffered from the action and other Israeli policies in the densely-populated region. ""It is about time for the Israeli government to face the consequences of its illegitimate actions since it sees itself above international law and ignores human conscience and must pay a price,"" Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said Friday. ""This price will be, above all, the loss of Turkey's friendship."" Turkey has been Israel's closest and steadiest Muslim ally since the Jewish state was founded. The relationship has had political, economic and military components, and both countries have been stalwart Western allies during the Cold War and over the subsequent decades. In fact, trade has grown from 2008 to 2010, according to Turkey's economy ministry's website. Turkey's imports from Israel totaled $842 million from January to July in 2010 and $1.1 billion during the same period in 2011. Turkey's January to July exports to Israel was $1.1 billion in 2010 and $1.3 billion in 2011. But ties between the nations have deteriorated during the administration of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan -- long critical of Israel's policies in Gaza. Davutoglu said military agreements have been suspended. But a senior Turkish official said that existing contracts must be honored ""no matter what"" and ""we haven't touched upon intelligence sharing."" Israel and Turkey have long had a close military relationship, but there have been no joint exercises for more than a year and a half amid tensions between both sides. The two countries have been negotiating for months in an attempt to improve their faltering relationship, but those efforts have failed. The release of the report was delayed while those negotiations continued. ""We've waited and waited,"" the senior Turkish official told CNN. ""There was almost an agreement that Netanyahu agreed upon... They're just wasting our time."" He was referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ""This makes it official. Before it was de facto, there was nothing going on, but definitely there was contact,"" said the official, who asked not to be named because of diplomatic protocol. One analyst said, ""Turkey has been warning Israel for months that it would do this and Israel chose to ignore it."" Hugh Pope, senior Turkey analyst with the International Crisis Group, argued that Turkey made a concession earlier this year, by preventing the Mavi Marmara from leading a second proposed blockade-busting flotilla to Gaza. Pope said Turkey's stance on Israel could be risky in its relationship with the United States. But the country -- while critical of Israel and friendly with Iran, Israel's arch-enemy -- has been firmly in the Western camp lately. ""At the moment, the U.S. seems to appreciate Turkey's role in the region,"" he said. Turkey has been an integral player in the allies' efforts in Libya and in Syria. Also, its foreign ministry has confirmed to CNN that Turkey agreed ""in principle"" to place a NATO long-range radar system on Turkish territory. ""Turkey's hosting of this element will constitute its contribution to the defense system that was developed within the new strategic concept of NATO. It will strengthen the defense capacity of NATO and our national defense system,"" the foreign ministry said. In contrast with Turkey's official view, the U.N. report on the flotilla incident said that Israel's naval blockade of Gaza was a ""legitimate security measure in order to prevent weapons from entering Gaza by sea."" But it criticized Israel's actions on the ship, saying its ""decision to board the vessels with such substantial force at a great distance from the blockade zone and with no final warning immediately prior to the boarding was excessive and unreasonable."" ""Non-violent options should have been used in the first instance. In particular, clear prior warning that the vessels were to be boarded and a demonstration of dissuading force should have been given to avoid the type of confrontation that occurred. The operation should have reassessed its options when the resistance to the initial boarding attempt became apparent,"" the report said. The report said the ""loss of life and injuries resulting from the use of force by Israeli forces"" during the vessel's takeover ""was unacceptable."" It said ""no satisfactory explanation"" had been provided for the deaths. ""Forensic evidence showing that most of the deceased were shot multiple times, including in the back, or at close range has not been adequately accounted for in the material presented by Israel."" The report said there was ""significant mistreatment of passengers"" by Israeli authorities. That took place from the takeover through deportation. ""This included physical mistreatment, harassment and intimidation, unjustified confiscation of belongings and the denial of timely consular assistance."" The report said ""the flotilla acted recklessly in attempting to breach the naval blockade,"" adding that actions of the flotilla needlessly carried the potential of escalation. It said most flotilla participants ""had no violent intentions,"" but there were questions about the objectives of the flotilla organizers, particularly the Turkish non-government organization, IHH. ""Israeli Defense Forces personnel faced significant, organized and violent resistance from a group of passengers when they boarded the Mavi Marmara requiring them to use force for their own protection. Three soldiers were captured, mistreated, and placed at risk by those passengers. Several others were wounded."" Davutoglu made reference to the U.N. report on Friday, saying it underscores Turkey's position that crimes were committed by Israeli troops on the ship. However, he disagreed with the stance that the Israeli blockade is legal. The senior Turkish official said the U.N. report is political. The report is called the Palmer report, named after the chair of the panel of inquiry into the incident, Sir Geoffrey Palmer. ""We don't recognize the so-called blockade out of Gaza. And we leave it at that,"" the senior official said. ""We will try to pass some kind of resolution or decision saying it's not legal."" He said Turkey is willing to help any legal challenges to the blockade. The Israeli government accepted the report -- with reservations. It said the decision to board the vessels was not excessive and unreasonable, claiming its troops gave repeated warnings to the ships, Netanyahu's office said in a statement. Israeli soldiers' lives were in immediate danger from passengers who carried metal bars, slingshots and chains. Several Israeli soldiers were wounded in the incident. ""Given these circumstances, Israel's soldiers clearly acted in self-defense and responded reasonably, proportionally and with restraint, including the use of less-lethal weapons where feasible,"" the Israeli leader's office said. An Israeli official emphasized that the report not only confirms the blockade's legality, it states there was no humanitarian problem in Gaza. The official added that anyone who wished to send humanitarian aid to Gaza needs to do it in coordination with Israel and the Palestinian Authority through the land crossings. The official said Israel hopes that there will be a way to overcome the controversy with Turkey and will continue to work toward that goal. ""As to the ambassador in Turkey, he had finished his posting a couple of days ago and had already said goodbye to his Turkish colleagues and was expected in Israel in the coming days,"" the Israeli official said. The ambassador is Gabby Levy.

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Search and rescue teams are searching for more than 100 people still missing after a river-going ferry capsized in Bangladesh, with three bodies recovered so far, a police official says. The boat, the Pinak-6, capsized late Monday morning in the Padma river, around 60 km (37 miles) south of Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka. Witnesses said the ferry had about 300 people on board when it sank. Jakir Hossain Majumder, a superintendent of police, told CNN three bodies had been found and up to 129 passengers remained missing, . Some 110 people survived the accident, he said. ""The ferry was overcrowded and the river was very rough because of bad weather,"" Majumder said. Authorities denied reports that the accident happened because of a collision. One of the survivors, Abul Hossain, said that most people traveling on the boat's deck survived, but passengers in the cabins remained missing. Exact numbers of missing were not initially available, as passenger manifests are often disregarded in the country. Overcrowding of ferries is a persistent problem in Bangladesh, which sees scores of casualties from ferry accidents every year. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has asked rescuers to take all necessary steps to facilitate the rescue operation, and salvage the stricken vessel, the national news agency, Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha, reported.

"Chances are, someone you know takes a sleeping pill. One in four Americans takes a sleep aid every year, according to the National Sleep Foundation, and the numbers are even higher for women -- one in three uses some sort of sleep medication a few times a week. Many sleeping pills stop working after a few hours, and most should not be combined with other medications. Why do women have such trouble sleeping? The reasons are as numerous as the passel of pills on the market: anxiety, depression, chronic illness, restless legs syndrome, sleep apnea, everyday exhaustion ... the list goes on and on. No wonder so many sleep aids are available. But sleeping pills, while often quite helpful, are largely misunderstood. Many stop working after a few hours, for instance, and most should never be mixed with other meds. So if you take one of these drugs now -- or plan to in the future -- there are important questions you need to ask. Here, the answers. Q: How do I know if I need a sleeping pill? A: More than a third of Americans experience occasional insomnia, which is defined as a few nights of restlessness, poor sleep, or trouble falling asleep. The general rule of thumb: If insomnia lasts a month and doesn't get better, talk to your doctor, says Frisca L. Yan-Go, M.D., director of the Sleep Disorders Center at Santa Monica-University of California, Los Angeles, Medical Center and Orthopaedic Hospital. She may recommend a pill for a short period, but don't be surprised if she suggests some tests or other non drug treatment options first. Health.com: How much sleep do you need? For starters, your doc may have you visit a sleep specialist to rule out sleep apnea, a common breathing disorder that wakes sufferers several times a night, sometimes without them even knowing it. If you have apnea, you may need a sleeping device that gently forces air into your windpipe. If you don't have apnea, some docs recommend cognitive behavioral therapy: You work with a trained therapist to change how you think about sleep and learn sleep-inducing techniques (like how to set up your sleep space and what to do before bedtime). Some studies say CBT is as effective as pills -- if not more -- and has no side effects. Health.com: Health risks of snoring and sleep apnea . ""Often people attribute everything bad that happens to them, including being angry and crabby, to lack of sleep,"" says Donna Arand, Ph.D., clinical director of the Kettering Sleep Disorders Center in Kettering, Ohio. ""It puts such a burden on sleep that not sleeping gets blown out of proportion."" CBT changes that kind of distorted thinking and in some cases is prescribed along with a pill. Q: Should I try over-the-counter drugs before a prescription pill? A: Many sleep experts aren't fans of OTC sleep aids because the meds don't usually help people with significant insomnia. And many -- like Nytol, Simply Sleep, Som­inex, and Unisom -- contain antihistamines (similar to the allergy medicine Benadryl) that can have side effects like dry mouth and eyes and next-day grogginess, Arand says. OTC sleep aids are best for people who have occasional sleep problems. Note: Women who breast-feed should avoid them, as should the elderly, who sometimes are more sensitive to the effects of antihistamines. Q: If I take a prescription pill and still can't fall asleep, can I take another? A: If you're taking a short-acting drug, such as Sonata, Rozerem, or Ambien -- and it's still early in the evening -- you can take another pill. Short-acting medications kick in and then fade out, which is why they are prescribed for people who have trouble falling asleep. Health.com: Is stress causing your insomnia? ""They last about three or four hours, so you could take another pill up until about 3 a.m. because it would metabolize before you wake up,"" says Ana Krieger, M.D., a sleep specialist at New York University. (The timing depends on your sleep schedule, of course, and it's always wise to check with your doctor, she adds.) Longer-acting drugs like the time-released Ambien CR or Lunesta -- for people who have trouble falling and staying asleep -- shouldn't be taken more than once a night. Q: Is it safe for me to take a sleeping pill at 11 p.m. if I had a glass of wine or a cocktail around 6 p.m.? A: It's probably OK, doctors say, but the sleeping pill won't work as well as it should. Here's why: ""Alcohol becomes a stimulant about three to four hours after you drink it, so you're actually working against your sleep medication,"" Arand says. ""It's a terrible combination."" Never drink and then immediately take a sleep aid. Why? Alcohol acts like a sedative at first, so you'd essentially be getting a double dose of sedatives. This can dangerously slow your heart rate and lead to dizziness, fainting, and shallow breathing, which can deprive your body of oxygen and damage brain cells. Worst case: You may even stop breathing altogether. Health.com: 11 kinds of insomnia . Because everyone metabolizes food and alcohol at different rates, there are no safety absolutes when it comes to the minimum number of hours you should wait between consuming alcohol and taking a sleeping pill, experts say. ""But if you're at a dinner party and really want a drink, have the alcohol early,"" Krieger says. ""Then eat dessert without any alcohol and wait as long as possible before taking your sleeping pill."" Q: Can sleeping pills give me nightmares? A: Not usually, Arand says, ""but some sleep meds can suppress dream recall."" When you stop taking them, the dreams (and possibly nightmares) may return. The mechanism isn't fully understood, but once there's a withdrawal -- even just when the dosage wears off during the night -- vivid dreams can occur. Q: Can I safely take sleeping pills for several months? A: There are no known long-term health risks with most sleep aids, but some are more addictive than others. ""The newer medications like Ambien C.R., Sonata, Rozerem, and Lunesta have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration without a limit on how long they can be prescribed,"" Arand says. ""They have a small addiction potential, and some have been shown to be effective up to one year."" The older sleeping pills with secobarbital (Seconal) and pentobarbital (Nembutal) pose a much higher risk of addiction. Tolerance is a common problem with all sleeping pills: After taking them for a while, you need more than the usual dose to help you sleep, which may lead you to think you're addicted. If the drug doesn't seem to be working as well as it used to or if you're taking more than your prescribed dosage, tell your doctor; she can change or adjust your medication. Q: I've been taking sleeping pills for several months. What's the best way to wean myself off? A: With your doctor's help, gradually step down your meds. Generally, you want to reduce drugs by one clinical dose per week: If you're taking 10 milligrams of traditional Ambien a night, start taking 5 mg a night for a week, Arand recommends. Next, cut that pill in half and take that amount for a week. Then, stop taking the drug altogether. Medications in pill (not capsule) form that aren't time-release versions are OK to split. (You can split Ambien, for instance, but not Ambien CR.) Q: I've heard of rebound insomnia. Is it really harder to fall asleep and stay asleep without pills if I've taken them a few times? A: You might have some trouble, Krieger says, though it's less likely with the newer pills -- these include Rozerem, Sonata, and Lunesta. ""Give it a few days to adjust after you stop taking the medication,"" Arand explains. If you still can't sleep, talk to your physician. Rebound insomnia is one of the reasons some experts recommend CBT over sleep medications. Q: If I don't want to use sleeping pills, are natural remedies worth trying? A: Yes, but don't expect miracles. Melatonin, a sleep hormone your body makes naturally, and the herb valer­ian may be helpful (both are available at drugstores), but some experts feel there's a lack of research to back up the effectiveness of these supplements. Plus, they're not regulated like drugs, so you don't always know what you're getting. That said, if you want to try melatonin, take 0.2 to 1 mg about four hours before bedtime: ""It's safe to take every day,"" Krieger says. ""As we age, our bodies secrete less of it, so taking a supplement can be helpful."" Melatonin may be particularly beneficial when you travel several time zones to the east (like Europe) and have trouble falling asleep.

"(CNN) -- A year ago Sunday, Neda Agha-Soltan died of a single gunshot wound to the chest. Her last moments -- captured on a cell phone camera and shown around the world-- catapulted her into the symbol of the postelection reform movement in Iran. Today, the Iranian regime's crackdown seems to have driven protesters off the streets. But the movement is not weakening, some analysts say. Instead, it's evolved into an online underground civil rights struggle, they say. ""I think they're going to continue to move forward, whether in the form of a green movement or another type of movement,"" said Karim Sadjadpour, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""It's just, basically, this march of history."" Agha-Soltan, 26, was at an anti-government demonstration in Tehran when she was felled by a single bullet to the chest. ""She has been shot! Someone, come and take her!"" shouts one man in the shaky cell phone video that has since been seen around the world. The video then shows blood streaming from her mouth, then from her nose. Her eyes roll to her right; her body is limp. A man, who had accompanied her to the rally, is then heard pleading with her by name. ""Neda, do not be afraid, do not be afraid,"" he repeats. Agha-Soltan was taken to a nearby hospital and, within a day, she was buried at Behesht Zahra, the city's largest Muslim cemetery, on the outskirts of the capital. Immediately afterward, she emerged as the face of the anti-government movement. Even world leaders took notice. ""We've seen courageous women stand up to the brutality and threats and we've experienced the searing image of a woman bleeding to death on the streets,"" said President Barack Obama. Eight days before Agha-Soltan's death, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's landslide election victory unleashed massive demonstrations in the country. Thousands of green-clad protesters took to the streets, accusing the government of rigging the elections. Iran's leaders called the uprising a foreign-led plot to overthrow the regime. It cracked down on the protesters -- with many killed and even more jailed. Images of the bloody crackdown fueled worldwide outrage. Agha-Soltan's pictures are still carried on placards at rallies outside Iran. ""She will become the image of this brutality, and of the role -- the truly significant role -- that women have played in fighting this regime,"" said Abbas Milani of Stanford University in California. ""I think that women are the unsung heroes of the last few years. They are the ones who began chipping away at the authority, the absolute dictatorship of the mullahs."" Iranian authorities continue to deny that security forces were responsible for killing Agha-Soltan. Instead, they have offered at least three separate explanations. They have blamed the CIA, terrorists and supporters of the opposition movement themselves. One year after Agha-Soltan's death, Iranian officials have yet to announce a single arrest in connection with her killing.","Neda Agha-Soltan's death made her a symbol of Iran's anti-government movement .

"(CNN) -- It's hard to keep up with so many statistics about modern parenting, but here's one that floored me when I heard it a few years ago: By 4, children living in poverty hear 30 million fewer words than children in higher income households, according to researchers. Thirty million! That is horrendous, but it gets worse: Hearing fewer words leads to learning fewer words, which means children start kindergarten with smaller vocabularies and a so-called ""word gap."" Often, they can't catch up when it comes to academic readiness and long-term achievement, studies have found. This week, the American Academy of Pediatrics announced new guidelines that encourage doctors to talk to parents not just about nutrition and illnesses but about the importance of reading out loud, singing and talking during an infant's first days. ""Fewer than half of children younger than 5 years old are read to daily in our country,"" the group's president, James M. Perrin, said in a statement. ""The benefits are so compelling that encouraging reading at young children's check-ups has become an essential component of our care."" Pediatricians see 16 million children 5 and younger every year in the United States, said Patti Miller, co-director of Too Small to Fail, a joint initiative of the Clinton Foundation and Next Generation, which is focused on helping parents close the ""word gap"" and improve the lives of children. ""So getting this word out through pediatricians and having them recommend to parents and support reading out loud to their children starting in infancy is so amazing and critically important,"" Miller said. My husband and I read aloud to our girls, 6 and 8, every day from the minute they were born, and we still do it during breakfast or before bedtime. Their love of reading shows us they have certainly benefited, and it truly pains me to think about their peers who might have missed out before enrolling in elementary school. President Barack Obama, in a video released by the White House on Wednesday, saluted the move by the doctor's group in connection with Too Small to Fail to help ""bridge the word gap'"" and increase children's chances of success later in life. ""We know that ... if a black or Latino child isn't ready for kindergarten, they're half as likely to finish middle school with strong academic and social skills,"" Obama said. ""By giving more of our kids access to high-quality preschool and other early learning programs -- and by helping parents get the tools they need to help their kids succeed -- we can give those kids a better shot at the career they're capable of, and the life that will make us all better off."" The key is getting the message to parents who too often don't realize the importance of reading aloud, talking and singing in the early years, Miller said. ""While this is a big gap, the good news is that the solution is pretty straightforward and we know that if we can get this important message out to parents about why you need to talk, read and sing, it can go a long way in terms of ameliorating this word gap,"" she added. The mission has some bipartisan support. Too Small to Fail released videos Wednesday of Cindy McCain, wife of Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain, former GOP Sen. Bill Frist and Hillary Clinton, who are teaming up to raise awareness about the importance of early literacy. Clinton talked about how she sang to her daughter, Chelsea, every night when she was a baby. When Chelsea finally mouthed ""No sing, mommy, no sing,"" Clinton went back to reading, she said in the video. ""Singing, reading or just talking is an important part of not only my daughter's brain development, but every child's,"" Clinton said. ""Thanks to new research, we know that children's brains light up and make new connections when their parents speak to them from the earliest days, but many of our youngest kids aren't getting the support they need to grow and thrive."" Said Cindy McCain, ""As a parent and former teacher, I'm very familiar with the way a child's eyes light up when he or she first starts to understand a new concept. Every moment a parent spends with a child, talking, singing, reading a bedtime story is an opportunity to make a lifelong impact in the child's life."" As part of the effort, Scholastic Inc. is donating 500,000 books for children up to 3 years old during the next year. The books will be distributed to 20,000 medical providers nationwide to be given to families during pediatrician visits. The American Academy of Pediatricians and Too Small to Fail are also developing a toolkit to help doctors teach parents how they can add more communication with their infants and toddlers to every day activities such as diaper changes, meal time, bath time and bus rides. ""Parents don't have a lot of extra time. They're working, they're often working multiple jobs and doing their best to get everything done in a day so what we're trying to do is make these tips very simple and straightforward,"" Miller said. If you have an infant or a toddler or you know anyone who does, encourage them to sing, talk and read aloud to their littlest ones. Those activities are just as important as making sure they get all the food and sleep they need to thrive.

"(CNN) -- The FAA's ban on U.S. flights to and from Israel's main airport for a second day marks another blow to that country's economy and a success for Hamas militants, experts said Wednesday. Even Israeli officials acknowledged the economic setback in the first 24 hours of the ban, which the FAA will review again Thursday. The European Aviation Safety Agency also recommended avoiding Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv, Israel, when the FAA imposed its ban Tuesday. ""I will not hide it from you. This is a major setback from Israel, the unfortunate American decision and what followed later was the European decisions,"" said Giora Romm, director of Civil Aviation Authority of Israel. ""And it is a big hit to the Israeli economy and to our pride,"" he said. But he and other Israeli officials insisted their country's sophisticated anti-missile system makes Ben Gurion Airport a safe place, even though a Hamas rocket from Gaza fell one mile away from the airfield, prompting the FAA temporary ban on U.S. flights. ""We knew about that rocket,"" said Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev. ""We were tracking it for about three minutes, our Air Force. We could have taken it down, but because we saw that it wasn't going to hit inside the airport, we let it through."" For some Americans, Gaza conflict strikes close to home . The FAA ban marks something of a victory for Hamas -- as well as prudent decision to protect commercial airlines, one expert said. ""I would say it's both because what is the objective of terrorists? To incite terror in people,"" said Tim Clemente, a retired FBI counterterrorism agent, who was referring to Hamas. ""I think because they probably got lucky with this one rocket that came close enough to Ben Gurion to make it seem like the threat was legitimate,"" Clemente added. ""It probably seemed like an empty threat initially. The more and more rockets flying into Israeli air space, (it's) eventually bound to happen that they could go this far. These projectiles, no different than firing a bullet into the air, it's got to drop in somewhere, and that trajectory is not well known by the person who fires it."" Israel finds Hamas are no longer amateur fighters . U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, who flew to Israel a couple of months ago, said he would feel comfortable flying to Tel Aviv this week, despite the FAA decision. ""Yes, I would feel comfortable, but I can understand why the FAA or other airlines who have liability concerns, who are worried about not just what one or two passengers feel but what everybody feels, I understand why they're being cautious,"" Kaine said. Last week's shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine, ""demonstrates reason for caution,"" Kaine added. Fawzi Barhoum, a Hamas spokesman, described the missile landing near the airport as one victory in the ongoing war between Hamas and Israel in Gaza. ""The resistance success in stopping the air traffic and isolating Israel from the world is a great victory for the resistance,"" Barhoum told Al-Aqsa TV. Another Hamas spokesman, Osama Hamdan, said Hamas is targeting Ben Gurion Airport ""because it's used by the Israel air forces."" Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg flew Wednesday to Israel aboard its national airline El Al and met with the Prime Minister and with President Shimon Peres. Bloomberg took exception with the FAA's temporary ban and said air travel to Israel was safe. He described the Tel Aviv airport and the national airline as ""the world's most secure."" ""The fact that a rocket falls a mile away doesn't mean you should shut down air traffic into a country and paralyze the country,"" Bloomberg said. Bloomberg said he was ""standing up for what's right"" and condemned Hamas for trying to kill Israelis. Referring to Hamas' claim of victory in disrupting air traffic, Bloomberg said, ""I probably don't agree with a lot of things that Hamas says, but that is probably true."" Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat said if Israel thought flying there was a risk, ""I would have called Michael (Bloomberg) and said, 'Don't come.' ""The reality is that if Hamas goes 'boo' and you get scared, you're helping Hamas with its goals,"" Barkat said. ""That's what terrorists try to do. They try to terrorize you. ""The best way to fight terrorism is exactly go on with your normal life,"" the mayor said. U.S. extends ban on flights into Israel's Ben Gurion Airport . What is Israel's endgame in Gaza?

"(CNN) -- What do you get if you combine the glitz and glamor of Las Vegas with the raw power of rugby sevens? ""It's the Olympics meets Mardi Gras,"" says Dan Lyle, a former captain of the U.S. rugby sevens team who was in ""Sin City"" as it played host to the American leg of the HSBC Sevens World Series. For the second year in a row it was South Africa left celebrating at the end of Vegas' annual sevens party. Since 2010, Nevada has played host to the U.S. leg of a nine-stop global tour to decide which country rules this shortened version of rugby union. And for the third time since the event moved to Vegas, South Africa emerged victorious after beating New Zealand 14-7 in Sunday's deciding match. But the weekend is about more than the action on the field. It is also an opportunity for fans to gather at the Sam Boyd Stadium and revel in the carnival atmosphere. With half-time cheerleaders and spectators in all manner of fancy dress costumes, sevens events are a spectacle on and off the pitch. Kenyan fans arrived on mass to cheer on their team, while Fiji recruited local schoolchildren to back them over three days of competition. South Africa's win lifted them above the All Blacks in the overall World Series standings, with five rounds of the championship remaining. It was the second successive year in which the Springboks have beaten defending series champions New Zealand in the Vegas final, and the third consecutive year in which the Kiwis have lost the showpiece match. Tries from Branco du Preez and Werner Kok secured the win and 22 series points for South Africa, which now leads New Zealand by one point. New Zealand will look to reclaim top spot at its home event in Wellington, which takes place across the weekend of February 7-8.","South Africa wins the U.S. leg of the Rugby Sevens World Series .

"(CNN) -- The Vatican is warning people who plan to travel to the beatification of Pope John Paul II to look out for scammers claiming to sell tickets for the ceremony. ""It is very important to make as clear as possible that no tickets are needed to attend the beatification of John Paul II,"" said monsignor Guido Marini, master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations, according to Vatican Radio. As in life, John Paul is drawing huge crowds after his death. Two million pilgrims are expected to flock to the Vatican for the special Mass, which will be presided over by Pope Benedict XVI and take place in St. Peter's Square on May 1 -- the first Sunday after Easter. But officials became concerned after hearing about ""unauthorized offers by some tour operators, especially on the Internet,"" asking people to pay fees for access to the event, the Catholic News Service reported. No tickets are required for the beatification Mass of Pope John Paul II, and any papal events that do require tickets are always free, the Vatican emphasized. There has been huge interest in John Paul's road to sainthood, with his beatification -- the first step in the process -- coming six years after his death. (That timetable is very fast in Vatican terms. Pope Benedict XVI dispensed with rules that normally impose a five-year waiting period before beatification can even start.) Born Karol Wojtyla in Poland, the charismatic John Paul spent more than a quarter-century as the head of the Catholic Church. He spoke more than a dozen languages and visited more than 100 countries, setting an unheard-of pattern of pastoral travel.","Some tour operators are claiming to sell tickets for the beatification of John Paul II .

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Clashes between Hamas militants and Israeli soldiers raged to the north and east of densely populated Gaza City early Sunday, the 16th day of an Israeli offensive, witnesses and medical sources said. A photo provided by the Israel Defense Forces shows troops in Gaza on Saturday. Heavy gunfire could be heard to the east of Gaza City -- home to about 400,000 of Gaza's 1.5 million people -- as fighting moved closer, according to a CNN stringer in the area. Israeli shelling north of the city killed two people, sources at Shifa hospital told CNN. Sunday's fighting came after one girl was killed and 49 other people were severely burned by fires caused by Israeli shelling in southern Gaza on Saturday, local hospital sources said. The shelling ignited several buildings, including a U.N. school, near the city of Khan Younes, sources said. The girl died of burns she suffered in one of the fires, the sources said. Also Saturday, a family of nine was killed when a shell hit their home in the village of Jebalya in northern Gaza, Palestinian medical sources said. The Israeli military was ""not operating in the area of this house, and no fire was directed in that direction,"" a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces said. Later Saturday, the IDF said that two rocket-launching squads near Jebalya were hit. Meanwhile, Hamas militants fired 20 Grad long-range rockets into Israel on Saturday, injuring four civilians, according to an IDF spokesman. And the Hamas commander in charge of launching rockets into Israel from the Gaza City area was killed Saturday by Israeli ground fire, the IDF said. Amir Mansi was spotted firing a rocket Saturday from the Jabel Rise area, east of Gaza City, during a ground force operation, the IDF said. Israeli forces opened fire, killing Mansi and wounding two other Hamas operatives, who were captured, the Israelis said.  Watch what overnight air attacks did » . Mansi was the leading Hamas authority on the Grad long-range missile-launching system, the IDF said. Grad rockets have allowed Hamas to reach farther into Israel than in previous attacks. Israelis say their Gaza military operation, which started December 27, is aimed at stopping Hamas militants from sending rockets into southern Israel. The operation began with airstrikes; a week later, the Israeli military launched a ground assault. More than 800 Palestinians have been killed in the attacks, including 235 children, and about 3,300 people have been wounded, according to Palestinian medical sources. Thirteen Israelis, including 10 soldiers, have died since the operation began.   See images from the offensive » . On Saturday evening, two pair of Israeli F-16 fighter jets that were on bombing runs in southern Gaza violated Egyptian airspace, a CNN team observed. ""We can tell they're coming through Egyptian airspace because they're over the far side of the building where we're standing,"" CNN's Karl Penhaul reported from Rafah, Egypt. He was atop a building about 500 meters (547 yards) from the Gaza border. The Israelis have been bombing tunnels that run under the border of southern Gaza and Egypt. Israel says Hamas smuggles weapons and munitions through them into Gaza. A spokesman for the Egyptian prime minister's office said the Israeli aircraft did not have permission to use the airspace. Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said no airspace violation had occurred. Before strafing the area in and around Rafah, the Israeli air force dropped leaflets warning residents to leave their homes because more Israeli attacks were imminent, Palestinian security sources said. According to an IDF spokesman, the leaflets say: ""Two days ago, the IDF distributed leaflets in Rafah in which the residents were warned to evacuate their homes for their own safety. As they heeded the IDF instructions, the harming of residents in combat was avoided. ""Over the coming period, the IDF will continue to target tunnels, weapon caches and terrorist operatives with growing intensity. For your safety and that of your family, stay away from terrorist elements or places where weapons are stored or places where terrorist elements operate."" In Gaza City on Saturday afternoon, heavy black smoke rose during a three-hour period during which Israel was to halt its attacks on militants so Palestinians could stock up on supplies. CNN's Ben Wedeman said the lulls, which have been tried before, aren't ""rock solid."" Limited military activity continues during that period, he said. A United Nations spokesman said Saturday's pause was not long enough to resume the transport of humanitarian supplies from Israel into Gaza. iReport.com: Share thoughts, reactions to crisis in the Middle East .

"GAZA CITY, Gaza (CNN) -- A Palestinian envoy called on the United Nations to condemn the deadly violence in Gaza as Israeli airstrikes on Hamas militants entered a second day Sunday. Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak told CNN that airstrikes into Gaza could expand. ""There is no justification for punishing 1.5 million in the Gaza Strip because of the actions of a few,"" Ambassador Riyad Mansour told reporters Saturday before entering a U.N. Security Council meeting scheduled for 10 p.m. ET. ""We hope we don't fail in having a reaction from the Security Council tonight."" Israeli airstrikes continued pounding targets in Hamas-ruled Gaza Sunday, killing at least 225 and injuring 400, in what Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said was a response to escalating rocket attacks against southern Israel. Yet Hamas blamed Israel for the artillery exchange, accusing it of violating a cease-fire intended to stem violence in the region. Barak said the Israeli attacks would continue as long as necessary until Hamas militants were ready to ""change their behavior."" ""This will not be a short operation. The war on terrorism is an ongoing one, and we will have to stand firm in order to change the situation in the south,"" Barak said Saturday. An Egypt-brokered cease-fire between Hamas and Israel expired December 19. Barak told CNN that Israel was compelled to respond with force after evacuating Gaza three years ago ""to the last square inch"" only to face continuous attacks. ""We have to experience shelling and rocket attacks on innocent civilians, that's something we will not accept,"" he told CNN. ""I am confident that the American government would not have waited one day before they would have responded if San Diego [California] would have been bombed or shelled or rocketed from Tijuana [Mexico] with thousands of rockets."" Hamas vowed to retaliate. ""We will stand up, we will defend our own people, we will defend our land, and we will not give up,"" senior Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan said.  Read reactions to Israel's strike on Gaza » . Hamdan also denied accusations that Hamas had provoked Israel attacks by violating the cease-fire with rocket attacks. ""Hamas did not fire rockets through the cease-fire. It's clear that the one who violated the cease-fire is the Israelis,"" Hamdan told CNN. ""For half the period of cease-fire, they closed all the checkpoints, and they killed 28 Palestinians."" The exchange of accusations came as bodies piled up on the streets of Gaza City, where hospitals and medical personnel were overwhelmed by the influx of wounded. Palestinian medical sources said that 225 people had been killed and 400 people injured, many of them in serious to critical condition. ""People are suffering and dying because of shortages of medical equipment,"" said Dr. Mahmoud el-Khazndar, who works at Gaza City's Shifa Hospital. ""The hospital is not accustomed to accept mass casualties like this."" The Egyptian government sent 20 ambulances and medical personnel to its border with Gaza to help treat and transport the wounded, an Egyptian official said. Tensions had been building between Hamas and Israel despite the six-month truce. The tenuous agreement was weakened in recent weeks as violence escalated. The Arab League condemned the attacks and scheduled an emergency meeting in Cairo, Egypt, on Sunday to discuss the situation. The meeting is set for 7 p.m. (noon ET). ""The situation is lending itself to escalation,"" Secretary General Amr Moussa told CNN International. ""The attacks have resulted in casualties among the civilians, among the young, among the population.""  Watch Moussa's interview with CNN International » . Moussa said the Arab League would call on the U.N. Security Council to issue a statement or resolution calling on all parties to end violence and enter into mediation. ""Also, we are calling on the Palestinians to close ranks and stop feuds between different organizations in Palestine,"" Moussa said, referring to struggles between warring factions struggling for power . Palestinian legislator Hanan Ashrawi also accused Israel of ignoring the terms of the cease-fire that expired December 19. ""This is certainly a very cruel escalation, a relentless bombardment of a captive civilian population that has already been under siege for months, that has been deprived of basic requirements like food and medicines and fuel and power,"" she said from Ramallah in the West Bank.  Watch Ashrawi condemn the airstrikes » . White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said the United States places the blame for the Israeli military action squarely on Hamas. ""We want the cease-fire to be restored, but we understand that Israel is reacting to the hundreds of rockets that have been fired upon the innocent people of Israel over the last few days,"" he said. ""Hamas must end its terrorist activities if it wishes to play a role in the future of the Palestinian people.""  Watch Johndroe comment on the attacks » . U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice also called for the cease-fire to be restored. ""We strongly condemn the repeated rocket and mortar attacks against Israel and hold Hamas responsible for breaking the cease-fire and for the renewal of violence there. The cease-fire must be restored immediately and fully respected,"" she said. iReport.com: Are you there? United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was ""deeply alarmed"" and called for ""an immediate halt to all violence,"" a spokesman said in a statement. Israeli military officials accused Hamas militants of firing more than 65 rockets into southern Israel on Wednesday, and the Israeli air force said it killed a Hamas militant whom it accused of helping launch the rockets against Israel. In a letter Saturday to Ban and the U.N. Security Council stated, Israeli Ambassador Gabriela Shalev said Hamas holds ""the sole responsibility for the latest events in Gaza"" and claimed Israel was exercising self-defense. ""No country would allow continuous rocketing of its civilian population without taking the necessary actions to stop it,"" Shalev said. ""Israel expects the understanding and support of the international community to its actions, as it confronts terrorism and advances the interest of all those who wish that peace and coexistence will prevail in our region."" The Israeli Defense Forces said Israeli aircraft were attacking ""a series of Hamas targets and infrastructure facilities,"" including headquarters, training camps and weaponry storage warehouses.  Map » . About 50 aircraft targeted more than 100 Hamas sites over the first two rounds of airstrikes Saturday, an IDF spokesman said. A Gaza-based reporter, whose name was withheld for security reasons, reported that the building housing Hamas-run television station al-Aqsa TV was destroyed early Sunday morning. The reporters also said a number of Hamas police stations were hit, killing some senior police commanders. Among those killed were Palestinian Maj. Gen. Tawfeeq Al-Jaber, a senior commander in the Hamas police force, and Ismail Jabari, who headed the special police force in Gaza, Palestinian sources said. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert called for patience, insisting that Israel wants to avoid causing an ""humanitarian disaster"" in Gaza. ""The instructions that we have given to our forces are to refrain from inflicting injury and harm on the innocent,"" he said at a news conference with Barak and Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni. Yet scores of deaths and injuries have been claimed on both sides as aid organizations urged Israel to cease the attacks. An Israeli woman was killed Saturday when a rocket fired from Gaza hit a house in Netivot in southern Israel, about six miles east of Gaza, Israeli police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld said. Two other Israelis were in ""medium to serious"" condition at Soroko Hospital in Bersheba, he said. Wounded people could be seen lying in the streets of Gaza City, and passers-by were doing what they could to summon help.  Watch panicked Palestinians try to help the wounded » . The U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees urged the Israeli government to stop its bombardment. ""UNRWA recognizes Israel's legitimate security concerns. However, its actions should be in conformity with international humanitarian law, and it should not use disproportionate force,"" the agency said in a news release. Saeb Erakat, adviser to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, urged Israeli and Hamas leaders to put another cease-fire in place. ""I believe this is the only way out. I don't think this problem can be solved through military means,"" he told CNN. ""I don't think it can be solved through aggression, through violence. Violence will breed more violence."" Abbas' Fatah party government is locked in a power struggle with the Hamas movement.

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Mounting tensions between the government and members of Turkey's Kurdish ethnic minority erupted on the streets of the country's largest city Thursday, after Kurdish activists clashed with riot police at a protest organized by the main Kurdish nationalist political party. Scores of Kurdish youths, many of them covering their face with bandannas, hurled stones and petrol bombs as security forces fired tear gas to try to disperse the crowds in Istanbul. Amid the chaos near the banks of the Marmara Sea, a CNN producer witnessed a man collapse, apparently overwhelmed by the clouds of noxious tear gas. Nearby, flowers littered the pavement where a women's flower stand had been overturned. The Peace and Democracy Party (BDP), Turkey's main Kurdish political party, organized rallies in Istanbul and other Turkish cities Thursday to mark ""World Peace Day."" But the rallies come within weeks of a fresh Turkish military bombing campaign of Kurdish separatist rebels who have long operated out of camps and bases across the border in Northern Iraq. Tensions escalated after a BDP official, Yildirim Ayhan, was killed Sunday during clashes with security forces on the Turkish side of the border. Ayhan was reportedly part of a group of Kurdish activists marching toward Iraq to serve as human shields against the Turkish aerial and artillery bombardment. The protest in Istanbul Thursday began fairly peacefully. Women in traditional Kurdish costumes led a column of thousands of people, many of them waving BDP flags and carrying banners that said ""peace now immediately"" and ""long live the brotherhood of people."" Since 1984, fighters from the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, have waged a bloody guerrilla war against the Turkish state that has claimed more than 30,000 lives. For decades, Kurds were the target of repressive government policies, implemented by officials who sometimes referred to members of Turkey's largest ethnic minority as ""mountain Turks."" Until just a few years ago, it was illegal to speak Kurdish on radio and television in Turkey. The government of prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has tried to improve relations by launching a state Kurdish language TV station in 2009. Despite these steps, some of the demonstrators on Thursday chanted ""Erdogan murderer"" and chanted ""Kurdistan will be the graveyard for fascism."" At one point in the march, BDP parliament member Sebahat Tuncel successfully negotiated with police officers who had objected to some of the political banners. The signs were taken down, and the march proceeded. But then CNN journalists witnessed dozens of young masked men emerge and begin hurling stones at bus stops. Then chaos broke out. As Kurdish youths hurled stones, police officers took cover behind fences firing round after round of tear gas into Kadikoy's main square. Frightened bystanders fled the scene choking. Meanwhile, protesters also lobbed Molotov cocktails into the melee. At one point, CNN cameraman Joe Duran witnessed a mob of Kurdish activists viciously beating a man. Duran left the scene of the violence after members of the crowd turned on him and told him to turn off his camera. A Turkish police commander told CNN there were approximately 3,000 protesters participating in the rally. The officer, who did not volunteer his name or rank, estimated only a minority of the demonstrators, some 150 people, participated in the violence. But some Kurdish activists blamed the government for the clashes. ""Look, we are struggling for peace and Erdogan attacks us using tear gas,"" said Sabiha Sayan, a female demonstrator, dressed in the white hooded veil traditionally worn by many Kurdish women. After a melee that lasted nearly two hours, demonstrators fled the scene. The ground was littered with shards glass from dozens of shattered bus stops and newspaper kiosques. Billboards advertising the face of Turkey's prime minister had been defaced with graphiti saying ""the Arab Spring will come to Turkey and you will be on trial."" Commuters began gingerly stepping through debris and past overturned police barriers, some of them wincing at the tear gas still lingering in one of Istanbul's busiest transit hubs. A pair of tourists from Italy wandered through the gas-canister strewn square pulling their suitcases, looking in vain for a shuttlebus to the airport. Other protests were scheduled to be held in other Turkish cities on Thursday, including the southeastern city of Diyarbakir, the unofficial capital of Turkey's Kurdish minority.

"(CNN) -- After weeks in limbo, the Los Angeles Clippers could shift hands from an embattled billionaire octogenarian to a former Microsoft CEO. But unlike owner Donald Sterling, whose racist remarks hurled him into a vortex of public criticism, Steve Ballmer flew under the radar in recent months before he laid down a record $2 billion offer for the team. Here are nine things to know about the man who could become the Clippers' next owner: . He's wealthier than Sterling. A lot wealthier. Ballmer, 58, is worth $20 billion, according to Forbes magazine. Forbes put Sterling's wealth at $2 billion. Ballmer succeeded his buddy Bill Gates as Microsoft CEO. He took the reins in 2000 from Gates, whom he became friends with at Harvard University in the 1970s. Ballmer earned a degree in mathematics and economics. Gates, of course, didn't graduate. But he seemed to do OK without a degree. Ballmer's years leading Microsoft were sometimes turbulent ... When Ballmer took over as CEO, Microsoft was the most valuable company in the world. But the company went on to lose more than half of its market value over the course of a decade. Investors have been critical of Ballmer for failing to anticipate the mobile computing revolution. ... but there were also great times. During Ballmer's tenure,Windows 7 was the fastest-selling operating system of all time, and Microsoft's cloud and enterprise businesses have stayed strong over the past decade. According to Microsoft, the company tripled its revenue and doubled profits under Ballmer's leadership. He retired in February and has been spotted at Clippers games since. He's really animated. Just watch how he takes the stage for a corporate presentation. ""Come on! Get up!"" Ballmer screamed at one gathering as he danced and leaped across the floor. ""Whoooooo! Come on! Give it up for me!"" By the time he took the podium, he barely had enough breath to say, ""I love this company!"" So much so that he's ripped his vocal cords. Perhaps it's not surprising, then, that Ballmer has damaged his voice during his public displays of affection (for Microsoft). According to The New York Times, Ballmer once shouted ''Windows! Windows!'' so furiously at a sales meeting in Japan that he ripped his vocal cords, requiring surgery. He's from Motown but has a soft spot for LA. Ballmer's dad, Fred Ballmer, was a manager at Ford Motor Co. in Detroit. The son excelled academically there and became valedictorian of his high school class. But he has reason to cheer for the Clippers. ""I love basketball. And I intend to do everything in my power to ensure that the Clippers continue to win -- and win big -- in Los Angeles,"" Ballmer said in a statement after making his offer. ""LA is one of the world's great cities -- a city that embraces inclusiveness, in exactly the same way that the NBA and I embrace inclusiveness."" Ballmer wasn't the only bigwig eyeing the Clippers. A group that included media moguls David Geffen and Oprah Winfrey also made a bid of $1.6 billion for the Clippers, a source told CNN. This isn't his first time trying to buy an NBA team. Ballmer's purchase of the Clippers would still have to be approved by 75% of the NBA's 30 owners. Last year, the owners denied the sale of the Sacramento Kings to a group that included Ballmer. That sale would have resulted in the Kings moving to Seattle, and the league's relocation committee recommended keeping the team in Sacramento. But with all the talk about changing ownership of the Clippers, Ballmer's fate this time may turn out differently. Sources: Donald Sterling found to be mentally incapacitated . CNN's Brian Todd and CNNMoney's David Goldman and contributed to this report.","Ballmer was known for screaming and dancing at Microsoft meetings .
He signed a binding agreement to buy the Los Angeles Clippers for $2 billion .
His estimated worth is $20 billion, compared with Donald Sterling's $2 billion .

"(CNN) -- Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked militant group based in Somalia, most recently claimed responsibility for the deadly attack at Kenyan mall in September of this year and is suspected of many other attacks in Somalia. Here is a Q&A that looks at this group: . What is Al-Shabaab and what are its aims? Al-Shabaab is a Somali group that was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. government in March 2008. It is seeking to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, which published a backgrounder on the group in July. The group is believed to be responsible for attacks in Somalia that have killed international aid workers, journalists, civilian leaders and African Union peacekeepers. It has struck abroad, too. It was responsible for the July 2010 suicide bombings in Kampala, Uganda, that killed more than 70 people, including a U.S. citizen, as they gathered to watch a World Cup final soccer match. How big is it? The total size of the group is not clear. A U.S. official who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the information said in 2011 that Al-Shabaab was estimated to control up to 1,000 fighters in the country. A U.N. report identifies one insurgent leader who is ""believed to command an estimated force of between 200 and 500 fighters,"" most of them Kenyans. And it has links to other groups. In February 2012, the group's leader, Ahmed Abdi aw-Mohamed, and al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri released a video announcing the alliance of the two organizations. Though Al-Shabaab's size may be in doubt, its potential for sowing terror is not. ""I would say that the greatest risks right now in East Africa are Al-Shabaab and the violent extremists that they represent,"" said Gen. Carter Ham in 2011, when he was commander of the U.S. Africa Command. CNN security analyst: Kenya, Westerners high on Al-Shabaab's list . Al-Shabaab's origins . Decades of weak government amid grinding poverty have long made Somalia a target for radical Islamist groups. Al-Shabaab's predecessor was al-Ittihad al-Islami (AIAI), which worked to create an Islamist emirate in Somalia. It was, in part, funded by former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. AIAI, which the U.S. State Department designated as a terrorist organization, strengthened after the fall in 1991 of Siad Barre's military regime and amid the years of lawlessness that ensued. In 2003, a rift erupted between IAIA's old guard -- who were seeking to establish a new political front -- and its younger members (Al-Shabaab, which means ""the youth""), who were seeking to establish fundamental Islamic rule. That led the latter to ally with a group of sharia courts -- the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) -- that was seeking to impose order over a landscape marked by feuding warlords in the capital city. Working together, the ICU and Al-Shabaab succeeded in 2006 in gaining control of Mogadishu. That sparked fears in neighboring Ethiopia that violence would spill over there, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Those fears -- combined with a request from Somalia's transitional government -- led Ethiopian forces to enter Somalia in December 2006 and to remove the ICU from power. That move proved to be a turning point, one that radicalized Al-Shabaab, which attacked Ethiopian forces and gained control of parts of central and southern Somalia, according to a 2011 case study by Rob Wise, who was then with the Counterterrorism Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. What is Al-Shabaab's relationship with Kenya? In 2011, the Kenyan government ordered a cross-border incursion intended to create a security buffer zone in southern Somalia after attacks on tourist destinations in northern Kenya that it blamed on Al-Shabaab. More recently, Ethiopian troops crossed the border and expelled Al-Shabaab from Baidoa, a strategic town midway between the Ethiopian border and Mogadishu. The group then targeted African Union soldiers and government buildings in the capital in suicide attacks. A suicide bombing in March 2012 killed five people at the Presidential Palace. Analysts say tension appears to have been growing within Al-Shabaab between Somalis and foreign fighters, several hundred of whom are thought to have entered Somalia in recent years to join the group. There may also have been disagreement within the group about the announcement in February 2012 of an alliance between Al-Shabaab and al Qaeda and about the group's ban on foreign aid organizations working in Somalia to save millions threatened by famine. Al-Shabaab breaks new ground with complex Nairobi attack . How and from where does it recruit? The organization has a sophisticated public relations arm that includes a Twitter account and video production abilities. ""Remember Mumbai?"" one tweet asked Saturday, as gunfire was erupting from Westgate mall in Nairobi. The comment was an apparent reference to the 2008 attack in which 10 Pakistani men associated with the terrorist group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba stormed several buildings in Mumbai, India, killing 164 people over a three-day period. ""Some youngsters resist death even when told not to be taken alive. It's going to be a long ordeal,"" Saturday's tweet said. Soon after, it announced it was responsible for Saturday's attack in Nairobi, Kenya. ""Alshabab confirms its behind the #Westgate spectacle,"" it said. A 2009 Al-Shabaab video is as slickly produced as a reality TV show, complete with a hip-hop jihad voice and a startling message. ""Mortar by mortar, shell by shell, only going to stop when I send them to hell,"" an unidentified voice raps on the video in American English. The video shows a man reported to have been Abu Mansoor al-Amriki, a U.S. citizen from Alabama. ""Away from your family, away from our friends, away from ice, candy bars, all those things is because we're waiting to meet the enemy,"" he says. But enemies -- and alliances -- can shift. Al-Amriki, whose real name is Omar Hammami, said last year in a video posted online that he had had a fallout with Al-Shabaab ""regarding matters of the sharia and matters of strategy"" and feared for his life. He was reported last week to have been killed in Somalia by Al-Shabaab. CNN is not able to confirm the report. Finding replacements may not be hard. Sheikh Ahmed Matan, a member of Britain's Somali community, said he knows of hundreds of young Somali men living in the West who returned to Somalia for terrorist training. How is it funded? The once-ragtag Somalia-based al Qaeda affiliate has grown into an economic powerhouse, raising tens of millions of dollars in cash from schemes that have involved extortion, illegal taxation and other ""fees,"" according to the 2011 United Nations report. The United States believed then that the group was coordinating with al Qaeda groups in Yemen and might have been plotting attacks in the region and abroad. In 2011, it was generating ""between $70 million and $100 million per year, from duties and fees levied at airports and seaports, taxes on goods and services, taxes in kind on domestic produce, 'jihad contributions,' checkpoints and various forms of extortion justified in terms of religious obligation,"" according to the report from the U.N. Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea. How have Somalis been affected? Years of lawlessness and poverty have exacted a toll that Al-Shabaab has not helped. In 2011, the United Nations declared a famine in the southern Somalia regions of Bakool and Lower Shabelle, and Al-Shabaab reversed an earlier pledge to allow aid agencies to provide food in famine-stricken areas. That year, the U.N. Interagency Group for Child Mortality Estimation announced that Somalia had the highest mortality rate for children 4 and younger in the world. In May, a report jointly commissioned by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization and the USAID-funded Famine Early Warning Systems Network reported that 258,000 Somalis had died in the famine between October 2010 and April 2012 and that half of the victims were younger than five. What is the United States doing? The United States has supported U.N.-backed African forces fighting Al-Shabaab and strengthened its counterterrorism efforts against the group. It has also donated millions in aid. The U.S. State Department said this week that Somali security forces, aided by the African Union Mission in Somalia, have driven Al-Shabaab out of major cities and towns, creating ""a window of opportunity to fundamentally change Somalia's trajectory. What is the status of Somalia's government today? In September 2012, Somali parliament members selected Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as the new president in a vote that marked a milestone for the nation, which had not had a stable central government since Barre's overthrow 21 years before. That did not mean Al-Shabaab was calling it quits. In January, French forces attempted to rescue a French intelligence commando held hostage in Somalia by the group. The raid left the soldier dead, another soldier missing and 17 Islamist fighters dead. But there has been political progress there. In January, for the first time in more than two decades, the United States granted official recognition to the Somali government. Want to know more about Somalia? Get the fast facts .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Turkey said Thursday that it will act against ""hostile action"" by Syria as troops and tanks deployed to the border after the downing of a Turkish jet last week. ""The incident of our unarmed plane on a test and training mission being shot down by Syria on June 22, 2012 in international airspace, has been discussed in detail,"" said a statement from Turkey's National Security Council after a five-hour meeting. ""It has been stressed that Turkey will act with determination against this hostile action reserving all its rights arising from international law,"" the statement said. The military deployment along Turkey's border with Syria is linked to rising tensions between the neighboring nations after the jet went down, a Turkish government official said Thursday. The apparent bolstering of its border force comes only two days after Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country was changing its military rules of engagement. It now will treat a military approach toward its borders by Syria as a potential threat that ""will be dealt with accordingly,"" he said. ""It seems that this is an implication of what the prime minister said in his speech,"" the Turkish official, who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak on the record, said when questioned on reports of troop movements in the border area. A man from the border village of Guvecci, who asked not to be named for security reasons, said that personnel had been arriving for the past two or three days. ""They are coming in military vehicles. We hear that such transfers are taking place to all border stations,"" he said. Is Turkey moving toward 'hard power' over Syria? Turkish state TV channel TRT gave details of military convoy movements in border areas on its website Thursday, saying trucks loaded with tanks had been moved to a military unit on the border with Syria. ""There were also air-defense systems among the military transfer of military vehicles and tanks,"" it reported. The semi-official Anatolia news agency also reported the transfer of armored vehicles to military posts in some districts of Sanliurfa and Hatay, along the border, on Wednesday. Relations between the two countries, already strained, have worsened significantly since Syria shot down a Turkish F-4 Phantom jet on Friday. Both sides say the jet strayed into Syrian airspace, but Turkey says the incursion was accidental and quickly corrected. Syria's response drew sharp condemnation from NATO, but the alliance did not promise any action in response to the incident. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Turkey did not invoke the NATO article calling for collective defense of members. Turkey, while not seeking specific action, asked NATO members to study a range of ways a no-fly zone could potentially help the situation and ease threats, a senior U.S. official said. It is ""not clear what, if anything, will be done,"" the official said. The request was first reported by The Telegraph, which described it as a request for a ""contingency plan."" The Telegraph cited a U.S. government source in saying the request took members by surprise but was now being taken back to the countries' capitals for consideration. For its part, the U.S. military planning includes a scenario for a no-fly zone as well as protecting chemical and biological sites, CNN has reported previously. Officials say all the scenarios would be difficult to enact and must involve large numbers of U.S. troops and extended operations. Meanwhile, the search for the jet's pilots continued. Turkey's chief of general staff said in an online statement Thursday that an area measuring 70 miles by 23 miles has been scanned, ""however neither our pilots nor the wreckage of the plane have been reached so far."" Some parts of the plane and some items belonging to the pilots have been found, however, the statement said. Five military vessels, a plane and four search-and-rescue helicopters have been involved in the around-the-clock search since the plane was lost, it said. In addition, a navy hydrographic survey ship started a deep water search Tuesday. A Syrian official said Wednesday that his country's forces might have thought the Turkish jet it downed was from Israel. ""As you know, there is a country called Israel there and, as you know, this Zionism country's planes are very similar. And because they both are from the same factory, from the U.S., maybe Syria thought it was an Israeli plane,"" Syrian Information Minister Omran Al Zubi told the Turkish A Haber channel. Speaking Tuesday in Ankara, Erdogan stressed that his country isn't an aggressor, but will respond bluntly to threats. ""I express this at every opportunity: We never have our eyes on any country's lands. We don't show a hostile attitude against any country. We never threaten the security of any country,"" he said in remarks aired on CNN Turk. ""We never hesitate to respond in the harshest way and do what is necessary with all our existing power, as well as with the power and inspiration that we get from our history, against hostile attitudes, attacks and threats against us."" Syria raised the stakes Monday in the war of words over the incident. Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi said the plane was shot down in Syrian airspace, disputing Turkey's claim that it was downed over international waters after briefly straying into Syrian airspace by mistake. ""What happened was a violation of Syrian airspace. Even Turkey says Syrian sovereignty was violated. Regardless of whether it was a training mission, a reconnaissance mission, it was a violation,"" Makdissi said. Photos: In Syrian hospital, no escape from war .

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- Howling winds ripped through Turkey's largest city Wednesday afternoon, tearing flags from their poles, destroying the set of a blockbuster Hollywood film, and injuring at least 31 people, Turkish authorities said. Three of the injured were in critical condition from the freak storm caused by a strong southwesterly wind known in Turkey as lodos. The winds -- measured at 100 kph or 62 miles per hour -- ripped the roofs from some 350 buildings, the Istanbul municipality reported, and downed more than 100 trees. Fishing boats rushed to the rescue of desperate passengers aboard a yacht that caught fire in the Bosporus, the strait that divides the densely populated city. As the wind quickly whipped up flames emerging from the back of the boat into a huge blaze, nervous passengers dressed in business suits clustered around the bow of the vessel. The Turkish television agency DHA filmed the passengers getting onto fishing boats as the fire engulfed the rest of the yacht. Turkish media said the passengers escaped the dramatic blaze unharmed. In Istanbul's posh Nisantasi neighborhood, the gusts ripped down an advertising billboard and sent construction scaffolding crashing down onto the pavement and parked cars. The storm also wreaked havoc on the set of the aptly named James Bond film ""Skyfall."" Turkish media have been reporting daily on the film's production, which is occupying Eminonu, one of Istanbul's most congested and historic wharf districts. CNN sister network CNN Turk showed video of film and set equipment in Eminonu's main square scattered and damaged by the storm.","The storm wreaks havoc on a James Bond film set .

"Editor's note: Actress and producer Didi Conn played Frenchy in the films ""Grease"" and ""Grease 2"" and is a celebrity spokesperson for the advocacy organization Autism Speaks. April 2 is World Autism Awareness Day. Didi Conn says she struggled to come to terms with her son Danny's autism. (CNN) -- When anything is wrong with your child, your first instinct is to make it better. Diagnose the situation, find the answer to the problem and take your child's pain away. But with autism, that takes quite a lot of doing. Right after our son Danny celebrated his second birthday, he started to have increasingly lengthy and violent tantrums, usually initiated by his extraordinary sensitivity to sound. At the slightest provocation -- telephone ring, doorbell, a blow dryer, blender -- he would begin to scream, hold his ears and throw himself down on the ground. We went right to our pediatrician, who was not alarmed, gave him a routine hearing test, and basically said, ""He's 2, you've heard of the ""terrible 2s."" This was 1994, and the classic signs of autism were not as publicized, and therefore as recognizable, as they are today. Then, a few months later, Danny began to wake up screaming two or three times a night. It would go on for hours, and there was nothing my husband or I could do. Since Danny was so sensitive to sound, he began to stop responding to us as a way of protecting himself from the pain. Feeling helpless and exhausted, we brought him to Dr. Isabelle Rapin, the head of pediatric neurology at the Albert Einstein School of Medicine. The diagnosis was PDDNOS: Pervasive Development Disorder Not Otherwise Specified. We learned that ""autism"" is an umbrella term for five spectrum disorders. After three more visits with  Rapin, Danny was diagnosed as a high-functioning child on the autistic spectrum, and she recommended we take him to The Therapeutic Nursery at the Jewish Community Center on the Palisades in Tenafly, New Jersey. The school was run by Rapin's colleague, Dr. Doris Allen. When a child is out of control, he or she needs you, the parent, to make them feel safe. So we were taught to sit behind Danny and hold him close with legs and arms wrapped around him, to become his backbone until the tantrum ran its course. When a child throws a tantrum, he throws himself on Mother Earth. I wanted Danny to throw himself on me and let me take care of him. But it was not to play out that way. I became the Queen of Denial. I wouldn't believe there was something ""wrong"" with my son. Can you imagine waking up two three times a night, every night, with your child for 12 years? I knew I had to change myself, become somehow bigger, larger, stronger, able to envelop him, subdue him, keep him safe; but, instead I went in the opposite direction. The shock of his diagnosis found me shrinking, hiding, disappearing, guilty and overprotective. I would not take any jobs. I would never leave him alone. What if he set the house on fire? I took Danny to try every therapy known at the time: excising sugar, wheat or gluten from his diet, acupuncture, massage, psychic healers, trips to Toronto, Canada, to The Listening Centre for auditory integration. I was told to see what interested him and develop those interests as a way in. For a few years, he obsessively loved daisies; so we planted daisies everywhere. Later, his most obsessive interest became pets, especially dogs. Now it seems like we've been to every pet store in every state and country and we have a bird, two cats, two dogs, five fish and a tortoise. I learned that early intervention with the appropriate therapy and a supportive family and a loving community will help your child reach his or her potential -- and that is the most important thing. We all want our children to be the best they can be; and one of the blessings of having an autistic child is that you notice every little achievement, and it becomes cause for celebration. In our case, there was yet another special reward from having an autistic child. Five years ago, I was approached by a television executive to develop an animated musical series for children. We have recently finished the pilot for Didi Lightful, and it centers around a little girl of that name who loves pets of all kinds and lives in a house full of them (her father is a vet). Of course, the prime inspiration for her character and adventures was and is Danny. Not only that, among Didi Lightful's neighborhood friends is the first autistic child in a fictional series of this kind. One day, as I was speaking to another mother of a disabled child, I said our secret weapon against this disease is to do all we can without any expectation of results. MUMS the word! MUMS: Mothers Unite for Miracles! And I do have so many miracles to report and so many miracle workers who made them happen. They include his relatives, doctors, therapists and teachers. This includes his Applied Behavior Analysis Hebrew teacher, Eve Rosenstock. For two years, she prepared Danny for his bar mitzvah -- yes, his full bar mitzvah for 100 people in a big temple. Thanks also go to two schools that have helped him greatly: Devereux Millwood Learning Center and his current program at Tappan Zee High School. Since decision-making is difficult for Danny, choosing ""what to be"" on Halloween is always an exasperating time and high on the IT (Inciting Tantrum) list. This year, for the first time, Danny was positive he wanted to be a pirate. We went to the Party Store and picked out a perfect pirate costume, eye patch and attachable parrot included. Danny was excited and I held my breath as we waited on a long line to check out, hoping that he wouldn't change his mind. And he didn't! That is, until we got into the car and he blurted out, ""I don't want to be a pirate! I hate pirates! Pirates are stupid! I want to be a witch!"" My mind races: Did I force this choice on him? I pull the car over. I take several deep breaths. I say, ""Danny look at me. I had a happy face all day and now look at me. Do I look happy?"" He turns his head in my direction and glances over to me. ""No, no,"" he says. ""That's right, you are upsetting me, Danny."" Then he says, ""Upsetting is a bad word for U!"" And then in a flash, I say, ""What is a good word for U?"" Before I can come up with one, Danny says, ""United, United is a good word for U!"" This is a miracle. ""Yes!"" I say, ""United is a perfect word for U!"" I burst out in tears. The spell is broken! Two miracles just occurred: . There was no tantrum, and Danny saw I was unhappy and realized the cause of it was his behavior. Yes, Danny! The opposite of Upset is United! We are United! Last summer, Danny and I went to visit our angel and his long-time therapist, Terese, at her home in Maine. It was raining as we drove down a dirt road on our way to a friend's farm. Danny was looking intently out the window at the fields and pastures we were passing, and he said quietly, ""I can see all of God's paintings. Thank you God for all the blessings I like."" And I thank you too, God, for the blessing of my beautiful, innocent son. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Didi Conn.","Didi Conn says she tried to deny the seriousness of her son's struggle with autism .

"(CNN) -- By now you've either heard about or read George Will's controversial column on the issue of sexual assault on college campuses. Will's take is that the numbers are ""preposterous"" and using ""simple arithmetic"" he can prove the ""supposed campus epidemic of rape"" just ain't so. Worse, Will believes that progressivism, the Obama administration, a college hook-up culture and shady math are turning survivors of sexual assault into a ""coveted status that confers privilege."" He goes on to claim that efforts to address the issue on campuses is ""making everyone hypersensitive, even delusional, about victimizations."" I'd no more want to have a conversation with George Will about sexual assault on college campuses than I wish to discuss racism with Donald Sterling. Both men are shockingly out of touch with reality. The fact is, George Will is so wrong. 1. George Will argues that ""Washington"" and ""progressivism"" are to blame for creating a ""supposed"" epidemic of campus rape. Wrong. Colleges prefer to sweep sexual assault cases under the rug, but students have brought the issue to light. In 2011, 16 Yale students and alumni filed a Title IX sexual assault complaint against the university. Other similar lawsuits emerged across the nation. As of this moment, there are 55 universities and colleges under investigation by the federal government. When Dartmouth (my alma mater) was confronted with the problem, the university experienced an astounding 14% drop in college applications. Unlike George Will, the president of Dartmouth College, Philip Hanlon, hit it head on: . ""From sexual assaults on campus ... to a culture where dangerous drinking has become the rule and not the exception ... to a general disregard for human dignity as exemplified by hazing, parties with racist and sexist undertones, disgusting and sometimes threatening insults hurled on the Internet ... to a social scene that is too often at odds with the practices of inclusion that students are right to expect on a college campus in 2014. The actions I have detailed are antithetical to everything that we stand for and hope for our students to be. There is a grave disconnect between our culture in the classroom and the behaviors outside of itâ€”behaviors which too often seek not to elevate the human spirit, but debase it."" 2. George Will suggests that women, hook-up culture, alcohol, anything but men, are to blame. He cites an example of a student from Swarthmore College in 2013 and condenses her report into two paragraphs -- as if it's representative of most sexual assault cases. Is he trying to find a way to blame women? Women who drink. Women who say no and fall asleep. Are they giving up their right to say no if they pass out or fall asleep? What about the morality of the man's actions? What respectable young man rolls himself on top of a drunk, sleepy corpse of a woman and forces her to have sex, after she had said no? Take 25 seconds and watch this brilliant PSA on what a guy should do if he finds himself with a woman passed out, asleep on his couch, or in his bed. It's really simple and there's no gray area or ambiguity: Good guys respect women. Creeps and criminals take advantage of women. 3. By addressing the problems, colleges are turning sexual assault victims into a ""coveted status."" Ask any woman who's been the victim of a sexual assault, unwanted groping, or date rape and you'll learn there's nothing to covet. And most definitely it's not a privilege. Dr. Jen Gunter, who wrote an open letter to George Will, offers a powerful first-hand perspective that will tell you what goes through the mind of a rape survivor. Victims often feel shame, guilt and fear. When they try to report it, they'll be questioned about their conduct, whether there's any drinking involved, what they were wearing, whether they've had sex with the man before. If it's serious enough and not a ""micro-aggression"" the attacker might be quietly punished, in a way that makes sure that no parents find out. But the victim has to deal with whispers and rumors. 4. The simple arithmetic doesn't make George Will's point powerful. George Will makes a big stink about whether it's true that ""one in five women"" could possibly be sexually assaulted during college. I could make arguments to counter his math. But let's do this: What if we say there are ""only"" one in 20 women who are sexually assaulted, rather than one in five? Does that make this problem less of a problem? Are those women who are raped less deserving of help? If armed robberies on campus happened to one in 20, or one in 20 students got the measles or food poisoning, we would call it an epidemic. Simply focusing on the validity of the numbers is not a way to invalidate the obligation and importance of universities taking this problem seriously. 5. ""I take sexual assault more seriously than you do."" In his response to the backlash, George Will pulled out the Donald Sterling ""I'm not a racist and I've never been a racist"" defense. He says, ""I think I take sexual assault much more seriously than you do. Which is why I worry about definitions of that category of crime that might, by their breadth, tend to trivialize it."" Actually, it's George Will who's trivializing the problem. When he summarizes a single story of sexual assault with a giant incredulous eye roll and suggests that a woman's conduct should be scrutinized more than a man's in assessing whether a sexual assault even occurred -- he is trivializing a creepy and criminal act. The reason why so many women haven't come forward until now is because victims assumed nothing would happen, or even worse, they'd face someone like George Will who'd put the blame right back on the victim.","Mel Robbins: George Will's views about sexual assault on campuses are wrong .

"(CNN) -- Ned Vizzini, who shot to fame at a young age for his teenage novels focusing on youth depression and anxieties, has died. In his books, Vizzini openly talked about his struggle with depression. He died Thursday of blunt impact injuries to the head, torso and extremities. ""The manner of death was suicide,"" the New York City medical examiner's office said. The office did not immediately say how Vizzini committed suicide. Vizzini started writing for New York media at 15, and published his memoir, ""Teen Angst? Naaah"" at age 19. The young author won accolades for his book, ""It's Kind of a Funny Story,"" for its portrayal of teenage depression. His other novels included ""Be More Chill"" and ""The Other Normals."" Amid his success, Vizzini continued to battle depression, which he openly discussed. Shortly after ""Be More Chill"" was published to critical acclaim, Vizzini said, he checked himself into the New York Methodist Hospital for help with his depression. ""Through individual and group counseling, medication management, therapeutic activities on the unit, sincere care from the people who worked there, and some very eye-opening conversations with my fellow patients, I made it,"" he said in a statement on the hospital website. After days at the hospital, he was discharged and got started on writing a book. ""This time, the book just flowed out of me,"" he said. The end result was his 2006 hit, ""It's Kind of a Funny Story."" The book was adapted into a movie starring Zach Galifianakis and Emma Roberts four years later. Vizzini also wrote for MTV's ""Teen Wolf"" and NBC's ""Believe,"" according to his website. He was 32. He is survived by his wife and son.

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Turkey appointed its new military chiefs at the end of four-day Supreme Military Council meeting on Thursday, filling the vacant positions after the country's top four commanding officers left their jobs en masse last Friday. Their unprecedented departures were due to disagreements between the military and the government over the fate of officers in jail for allegedly taking part in plots to overthrow the ruling Justice and Development Party. Following approval by President Abdullah Gul, his chief press adviser Ahmet Sever made the final decisions public. As expected, the former Gendarmerie Commander General Necdet Ozel will become the Chief of General Staff once the decision is made formal with cabinet approval. Ozel was appointed to this position in acting capacity Friday night to resolve the crisis that erupted before the council meeting. Sever announced that General Hayri Kivrikoglu will be the new land forces commander, while Admiral Emin Murat Bilgel will become the head of naval forces and General Mehmet Erten will take over as the head of air forces. General Bekir Kalyoncu is appointed to lead the Gendarmerie. About 200 soldiers, both retired and active-duty, are defendants in cases of alleged coup plots against Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government. There are high-level officers in jail among them who were in line for promotion. Contrary to claims that these officers would be suspended or forced to retire, the military council extended their tenure for a year, which appears to be a compromise between the government and the military. The Turkish military, the second largest armed forces in NATO, has always perceived itself as the guardian of the secular regime founded by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in 1923. It has overthrown at least four civilian governments since 1960. However, its influence has been gradually declining since Erdogan's Justice and Development Party has been in power since 2002. Since then, the generals, as well as other elements of Turkey's traditional secular establishment, have periodically clashed with Erdogan, whose party has its roots in political Islam.","Turkey names four new top commanders .

"(CNN) -- An alleged new case of waterboarding emerged in a massive report Thursday detailing brutal CIA interrogations of Libyan detainees last decade before they were handed over to Moammar Gadhafi's regime. Mohammed al-Shoroeiya ""provided detailed and credible testimony that he was waterboarded on repeated occasions during U.S. interrogations in Afghanistan,"" Human Rights Watch said in a 200-plus page report. The allegations directly challenge long-standing claims by President George W. Bush and his administration that only three terror suspects, none of whom were Libyan, were waterboarded during interrogations. Human rights groups consider waterboarding -- in which a prisoner is restrained and water poured over his mouth and nose to produce the sensation of drowning -- a form of torture. ""While never using the phrase 'waterboarding,' he said that after his captors put a hood over his head and strapped him onto a wooden board, 'then they start with the water pouring. ... They start to pour water to the point where you feel like you are suffocating.' He added that 'they wouldn't stop until they got some kind of answer from me,'"" the report said. Laura Pitter, a counterterrorism adviser for Human Rights Watch and the author of the report, said abuses occurred in U.S.-run facilities in Afghanistan between April 2003 and April 2005. She said waterboarding occurred in 2003 but it is not clear if it occurred afterward. The rights group's accusations come a week after the U.S. Justice Department closed a criminal investigation without charges into the deaths of two terror suspects in CIA custody. Justice Department won't prosecute CIA interrogators in two prisoner deaths . CIA spokeswoman Jennifer Youngblood said she couldn't comment on the report's ""specific allegations"" but said the CIA has been on record about ""three substantiated cases in which detainees were subjected to the waterboarding technique."" ""The Department of Justice has exhaustively reviewed the treatment of more than 100 detainees in the post-9/11 period -- including allegations involving unauthorized interrogation techniques -- and it declined prosecution in every case,"" she said. Among those who officials have acknowledged were subjected to waterboarding was Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, described as the principal architect of the September 11 terrorist attacks. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request by CNN for comment on the allegations. CNN is unable to independently corroborate the claims by Human Rights Watch. Joseph Wippl, a 30-year CIA operations officer and director of graduate studies at Boston University's Department of International Relations, said these kinds of ""allegations"" have been probed ""countless times."" ""If further facts are established,"" he said, another investigation ""to get at the truth"" will occur. Wippl said ""accusations of torture are a part of the propaganda war"" against the United States. He stressed that ""lengthy"" congressional probes into waterboarding identified only three people who had been victims of the practice. ""Either the Libyan victims are making up the story, embellishing the story, or have come up with some facts that are new,"" Wippl said. ""There could have been renegade interrogations."" The Human Rights Watch report cites repeated allegations of torture by the detainees while in the custody of the United States and other countries: being chained to a wall naked, forced into cramped positions, restrained in painful positions for long periods and undergoing repeated beatings. Al-Shoroeiya and another detainee, Khalid al-Sharif, also underwent water torture similar to waterboarding, the report said. ""The scope of Bush administration abuse appears far broader than previously acknowledged and underscores the importance of opening up a full-scale inquiry into what happened,"" Pitter said. Her report is titled ""Delivered into Enemy Hands: US-Led Abuse and Rendition of Opponents to (Gadhafi's) Libya."" The report also largely relies on Human Rights Watch interviews with former detainees, many of whom claim to have been members of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, which was working to overthrow Gadhafi in the early 1980s. It cites accounts of 14 former detainees and what it describes as ""recently uncovered CIA and UK Secret Service documents"" found in the sacked offices of Libya's former intelligence chief as proof of the torture and mistreatment. ""The interviews and documents establish that, following the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S., with aid from the United Kingdom and countries in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia arrested and held without charge a number"" of LIFG members, Human Rights Watch said. They were ""rendered"" to Libya, mostly between 2004 and 2006, when ""the United States and the United Kingdom were trying to transform"" Gadhafi ""from foe to ally"" during their rapprochement with the dictator. Most members of the LIFG had fled Libya by the end of the 1980s and set up operations in Afghanistan. A number of the detainees were picked up in Afghanistan, according to the report. Detainees claimed to have been turned over to Gadhafi and then jailed. Some of the detainees claimed torture at the hands of Gadhafi's jailers, while other said they were not mistreated. ""All interviewees said their captors forcibly returned them to Libya at a time when Libya's record on torture made clear they would face a serious risk of abuse upon return. All had expressed deep fears to their captors about going back to Libya and five of them said that they specifically asked for asylum,"" the report said. Terror analysts say that by at least 2004, some members of the group had aligned themselves with al Qaeda, though many former members say the LIFG had nothing to do with the terror group. The United States classified the LIFG as a terror organization in late 2004. Many of the detainees, according to the report, were freed during Libya's civil war and fought alongside the rebels. ""Some of those who were rendered and allegedly tortured in U.S. custody now hold key leadership and political positions in the country,"" the report said. The documents were found by Human Rights Watch researchers on September 3, 2011, in the offices of former Libyan intelligence chief Moussa Koussa. In late August 2011, Tripoli fell to rebel forces that were backed by NATO. Gadhafi was captured and killed by rebels in October 2011. One of the documents -- a fax -- offers to help Libya pay for an airplane to pick up a prisoner, while a communiquÃ© from a British intelligence officer to Koussa offers congratulations to Libya over its jailing of another former detainee handed over by the UK. ""The report makes clear there's so much that we don't know about what happens in these places,"" Pitter said. ""This is the tip of the iceberg."" She said the actions occurred during the Bush administration but are now the legacy of President Obama. She said the United States must make clear these actions should never happen again. ""The one thing we're hoping the report does make clear is it's important for the United States to look back and acknowledge mistakes were made,"" she said.

"GAZA CITY (CNN)  -- About 150 pro-Fatah Palestinians seeking refuge from a Hamas crackdown in eastern Gaza City were allowed into Israel on Saturday, an Israel Defense Forces spokesman told CNN. Fatah members are led handcuffed and blindfolded through a Gaza City checkpoint into Israel on Saturday. They were let in at the request of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas after Hamas took control of a neighborhood in eastern Gaza City on Saturday. The Palestinians entered through a security checkpoint in Nahal Oz in the Gaza's northern region Saturday afternoon, the spokesman said. ""They were asking to enter the state of Israel after being threatened by Hamas gunmen,"" the spokesman said. The spokesman said the Palestinians, some of whom were wounded, were allowed to cross the border after they disarmed. He also said they would be asked about the events leading them to seek refuge in Israel. Those who suffered injuries were taken to a facility to receive medical treatment. It was a rare act that could be interpreted as a sign of Israel's support of the Fatah party, which is led by Abbas. ""It was a sort of humane gesture,"" the IDF spokesman said. Hamas forces took control of the al-Shojaeya neighborhood in eastern Gaza City late Saturday, ending several hours of deadly fighting. The Hamas forces were battling a family suspected of harboring Fatah members wanted in last week's Gaza beach bombing. Hamas police surrounded the clan, and a battle began with rocket-propelled grenades, rockets and rifles, sources said. The violence in the large neighborhood left four people dead, including two police officers, and wounded at least 60 others.  Watch a report on the violence » . The IDF confirmed that some of the Palestinians who entered Israel on Saturday were members of the clan. Hamas Interior Minister Said Salam said in a news conference that bomb-making materials were found. He asked why so many people would have fled to Israel if they weren't guilty. Hamas forces began raiding houses in the 15-block neighborhood after the fighting died down, arresting at least 12 men Saturday night. Earlier, the Hilles clan, a family known to support Fatah, refused Hamas police demands to hand over 20 activists suspected in the bomb attack, sources said. Hamas security forces in Gaza had already detained hundreds of people affiliated with Fatah since five Hamas militants and a child died in the July 25 beach bombing. Fatah sources say about 450 were apprehended. Among the dead in the beach attack was Amar Musubah, a Hamas military commander, who has been the target of Israeli military assassination attempts. Fatah denied responsibility for the attack. Hamas sources said Saturday the group will release 10 Fatah members arrested earlier in Gaza. In addition, Hamas released Fatah spokesman Ibrahim Abu-Naja. Hamas also shut down a radio station, accusing it of airing pro-Fatah broadcasts. The two Palestinian factions have been bitterly divided since Hamas drove Abbas' security forces from Gaza last year. Gaza tunnel collapse kills 5, hurts 16 . Meanwhile, early Saturday, a tunnel used to smuggle goods into Gaza from Egypt collapsed, killing at least five people and injuring 16, Palestinian sources said. The supply tunnel, which collapsed near Rafah, was one of many dug along the Gaza-Egypt border in the past year, since Israel closed border crossings. The move followed Hamas' takeover of the territory. The tunnel operations have grown into a big business. The tunnels are sometimes built too close to each other for safety.

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Blasts of heavy machine-gun fire and explosions from airstrikes filled the air in Gaza early Sunday morning, hours after Israel rolled thousands of troops into the Palestinian territory. Israeli soldiers on the Israeli-Gaza border wait to enter Gaza on Saturday night. At least four Palestinians have been killed as a direct result of the ground assault, Palestinian medical sources said, bringing the death toll in Gaza to 460 since the conflict erupted December 27. The ground assault followed a weeklong campaign of airstrikes in what Israel says is an offensive to halt rocket attacks from Hamas militants in Gaza. ""We want to create a situation where the civilian population in southern Israel is no longer on the receiving end of those deadly Hamas rockets,"" Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev told CNN. ""We haven't articulated regime change as the goal of this operation. Our goal is to protect our people,"" Regev said. Israeli officials say four people have been killed and 59 wounded in Hamas rocket attacks in the past week.

Meanwhile, Hamas militants launched 20 rockets from Gaza into Israel by late afternoon Saturday, IDF spokeswoman Maj. Avital Leibovich said. Rockets set a house on fire in Ashkelon, damaged a kibbutz dining hall and slightly wounded two people in an eight-story building in Ashdod, according to Israeli ambulance services. ""We still see that Hamas is targeting Israeli civilians. Namely, we still did not reach the goal of crippling Hamas' launching capabilities,"" Leibovich said.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- An investigation is underway in northwest Georgia after a police officer shot and killed 17-year-old Christopher Roupe. There are conflicting reports as to what happened. According to an affidavit dated Friday, two police officers went to a home in Euharlee, Georgia, to serve probation violation arrest warrants. One officer went to the front door while another took a position on the northeast corner of the residence, the affidavit says. The officer at the door knocked and could hear someone from inside coming to the door. Before it opened, that officer heard what she believed was the action of a firearm, at which point the officer drew her weapon, the affidavit says. ""A male subject opened the front door pointing a pistol ... and pulled the trigger,"" the affidavit reads. The officer fired one round. A statement from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation basically echoes the court document. It does not mention the officer having heard the action of a firearm, but said that Roupe opened the door with a drawn handgun. The officer called for medical assistance. The teenager was then transported to a hospital and pronounced dead, said the GBI, which is conducting an investigation into the use of force. A lawyer for Roupe's family offers a different account of the shooting. According to attorney Cole Law, eyewitness testimony establishes that Roupe was holding a Wii Remote, not a handgun, when he opened the door. The teenager heard a knock, asked who it was, received no response, opened the door and was immediately shot in the chest, Law said. Roupe's father, sister and brother were home at the time. Law described Roupe as a great kid. He attended Woodland High School, in nearby Cartersville, where he was in the ROTC program and dreamed of joining the Marines. ""The story that he pointed a gun at the officer defies everything we know about him,"" said Law.","Authorities say Christopher Roupe, 17, pointed a handgun at the officer .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama signed legislation Friday temporarily restoring full funding to the Federal Aviation Administration, breaking a political impasse and allowing roughly 4,000 furloughed federal employees to return to work. The measure also promises to restore tens of thousands of jobs in the construction industry and elsewhere tied to airport improvement projects put on hold as a result of the funding shortfall. The bill took less than one minute to pass a nearly empty Senate chamber Friday morning.  It was cleared with a legislative maneuver known as ""unanimous consent,"" which allows as few as two senators to approve a bill so long as no objections are filed.  Most members of Congress are currently away from Washington on their summer recess. The president hailed the agreement, noting that it removed ""the uncertainty hanging over the jobs of thousands of hardworking FAA employees."" ""This impasse was an unnecessary strain on local economies across the country at a time when we can't allow politics to get in the way of our economic recovery,"" Obama said Friday.  ""I'm glad that this stalemate has finally been resolved."" The political differences that led to the funding shortfall, however, have not been resolved.  Democrats and Republicans are still at sharp odds over whether to continue providing subsidies to smaller rural airports.  The two parties also differ over whether to make it easier for airline employees to unionize. Congress will have to revisit the issue within six weeks to avoid another lapse in funding. Outrage over Congress's decision to adjourn for the summer without providing adequate funding for the approximately 4,000 employees contributed to the push for at least a short-term resolution.  Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood repeatedly took to the airwaves over the past several days, cajoling lawmakers to come back from their break and reach an agreement. For workers facing the possibility of lost wages for weeks to come, news of the breakthrough evoked an emotional response. Evelyn Martinez, an FAA inspector, cried when she learned of the deal. The tears are ""out of relief,"" Martinez said, adding that while her post-graduate education taught her how government works, ""what we are experiencing is outside of any textbook."" ""This is a tremendous victory for American workers everywhere,"" LaHood said in a statement Thursday.  ""From construction workers to our FAA employees, they will have the security of knowing they are going to go back to work and get a paycheck -- and that's what we've been fighting for."" Since authorization for FAA funding expired in late July, the agency has also been unable to collect federal taxes on airline tickets -- leading to a revenue loss of approximately $30 million a day.  If the dispute had continued until Congress returned in September, the federal government would have lost over $1 billion in revenue. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, had been in talks this week with House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and administration officials about how to resolve the funding impasse, a Senate Democratic leadership aide told CNN. Reid noted Thursday that the agreement ""does not resolve the important differences that still remain."" ""But I believe we should keep Americans working while Congress settles its differences, and this agreement will do exactly that,"" he said. The agreement is the 21st short-term funding extension for the FAA.  The Republican-led House previously passed a short-term extension, but it included a number of changes opposed in the Democratic-controlled Senate. One of the changes involves language in the House bill that would reduce or kill subsidies to rural airports, specifically targeting some in Nevada, Montana and New Mexico -- three states with influential Democratic senators. The Senate ultimately agreed to pass the House bill, but as part of Thursday's agreement, LaHood will notify congressional leaders that he has the authority to grant waivers to affected community airports, which would exempt them from the subsidy cuts. While no specific exemptions are required, LaHood's authority gives Democrats the assurance that the disputed language they opposed can be overridden, the leadership aide noted. A larger dispute regarding the unionization of airline workers has not been addressed at all, however. Republicans are livid over a recent ruling by the National Mediation Board that makes passage of a vote to unionize dependent only on getting more than 50% support from those actually voting.  For example, if a company has 1,000 workers but only 200 take part in the vote to unionize, the rule change would mean only 101 ""yes"" votes were needed for it to pass. Under old rules, more than 50% of all workers eligible to vote -- or in this example 501 ""yes"" votes -- would have been required for it to pass.  Workers who didn't cast ballots were counted as having voted ""no,"" making it more difficult for supporters to succeed. It remains unclear what -- if anything -- the divided Congress will ultimately do in response to the change.

Clermont president Claude Michy described the 36-year-old Portuguese's decision as ""sudden and surprising,"" though no explanation was given for her change of heart. In a statement published on the club's website Michy added: ""I deeply regret this situation. I thank all those who have supported me and I am most grateful. The operation of the club will continue with other stakeholders to prepare for the new season."" Costa would have been the first female coach of a French professional football club, while her appointment represented the first time a team in the top two divisions of one of Europe's big five leagues -- Spain, Germany, England, Italy and France -- had hired a female manager.

"(CNN) -- For many Americans, this summer has been miserably hot. Heat advisories and warnings have been issued from coast to coast, with high temperatures often reaching into the triple digits, and July went into the record books as the hottest month ever for the continental United States. But in certain parts of the world, this is the norm -- or maybe even on the cool side. Try Kuwait City, for instance. In July, its average high temperature is 116 degrees Fahrenheit. Or Timbuktu in Mali, where the highs average 108 in May and was once recorded at 130. 130! That ranks fifth on the all-time list. The highest temperature ever recorded on the planet was in 1922, when a thermometer in El Azizia, Libya, hit 136. Some dispute that mark, saying it was improperly measured. If that's true, the record would be the 134, reached nine years earlier in Death Valley, California. But the world's hottest place might not be any of these, according to a team of scientists from the University of Montana. It says the highest temperatures on Earth are found in areas that don't even have weather stations. ""The Earth's hot deserts -- such as the Sahara, the Gobi, the Sonoran and the Lut -- are climatically harsh and so remote that access for routine measurements and maintenance of a weather station is impractical,"" said David Mildrexler, lead author of a recent study that used NASA satellites to detect the Earth's hottest surface temperatures. The satellites detect the infrared energy emitted by land. And over a seven-year period, from 2003 to 2009, they found Iran's Lut Desert to be the hottest place on Earth. The Lut Desert had the highest recorded surface temperature in five of the seven years, topping out at 159 degrees in 2005. Other notable annual highs came from Queensland, Australia (156 degrees in 2003) and China's Turpan Basin (152 degrees in 2008). Why to expect more weather disasters . It's important to stress that surface temperatures are naturally higher than the air temperatures measured by weather stations. Air temperatures have to be measured by thermometers placed off the ground and shielded from sunlight, according to global meteorological standards. But the study shows that today's modern records might not necessarily be the most accurate. ""Most of the places that call themselves the hottest on Earth are not even serious contenders,"" co-author Steve Running said. The world's highest recorded air temperatures . 1.

"(CNN) -- Turkey's Istanbul, the city where east meets west, is seen as a potentially pivotal center for relations between Europe and Asia. Now Turkey, once home of the Ottoman Empire -- one of the most powerful empires in the world before its demise in the 1920s -- is on the rise again, with its economy proving to be one of the strongest in the European region. ""Turkey has outperformed Europe in the last two years, consecutively growing around 9%,"" Guler Sabanci, Sabanci Group chair, told CNN. World's top economies in 2050 will be... Turkey, unlike many economies on the continent, has been in the midst of an economic boom. But the debt woes of those nearby inevitably impacts Turkey's health. Nearly half of Turkey's exports head to the eurozone, while around 75% of the country's foreign investment is injected by Europe. Further 75% of the country's tourism comes from Europe. Sabanci, who helms one of Turkey's largest companies, warns Europe's slowdown is ""an important issue"" for the country, and will create headwinds in the months ahead. But Sabanci expects Turkey to continue its pitch for European Union membership, noting the country is already ""economically integrated"" with the region. Short-term gain or long-term pain?

"(CNN) -- For sale: One million barrels of crude oil. Attractive discount offered. Currently sitting off Moroccan coast. That's what the Iraqi Kurds are offering potential buyers, much to the fury of the government in Baghdad. It amounts to a declaration of economic independence, fraying the already tattered ties holding Iraq together. Here's how it works: . The Kurdish Regional Government, or KRG, deals with oil exploration companies independent of the central government. Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Total are among the companies working in Iraqi Kurdistan. The crude produced there goes through a pipeline to the Turkish port of Ceyhan in the Mediterranean. Then it's loaded onto tankers and floats about until it finds a buyer. The proceeds are held in a Turkish bank; the Kurds say they will take 17% and the Iraqi government is entitled to the rest. Who are the Iraqi Kurds? Along with the Shiite Arabs and the Sunni Arabs, the Kurds are one of the three dominant groups in the fractious and diverse nation of Iraq. While most Kurds are Sunnis and a minority are Shiite, they identify first as an ethnic group. They are distinct from Arabs and speak an Iranian language. The Kurdish population numbers 15% to 20% of Iraq, which has a population of 32,585,000, according to an estimate from the CIA World Factbook. There are also large Kurdish populations in the neighboring countries of Iran, Syria and Turkey, with varying levels of independence aspirations. The KRG rules an autonomous region with its own Cabinet, parliament, president and military forces. The region consists of three provinces In Iraq's north: Irbil, Sulaimaniya, and Duhuk. The Kurds had been oppressed by Iraq's Saddam Hussein government, but the area has avoided much of the country's warfare since Hussein's overthrow in 2003. Today, Iraqi Kurdistan is regarded as a relatively stable and economically booming Middle East success story, thanks to its oil clout. Scaling up . The KRG began exporting small amounts of crude oil in trucks last year, but the pipeline to Ceyhan gives it the opportunity to scale up. Industry sources say more than 100,000 barrels are flowing through the pipeline every day, and more than 2 million barrels are already stored at Ceyhan. Altogether, there may be the equivalent of 45 billion barrels of oil under Kurdish land in Iraq, according to the KRG. Aligning with Israel . The most recent buyer appears to be Israeli. Late Friday, the SCF Altai docked at the port of Ashkelon, having taken on a load of Kurdish crude from another tanker in the Mediterranean a week ago. Why Israel? It's not clear who the buyer is, or whether the oil changed hands once or more before finding its final destination. But the Israelis may see the Kurds as a natural ally in a region where both feel they are threatened minorities. Problems offloading . Another much larger cargo -- said to contain 1 million barrels -- has been at sea for more than a month. According to shipping sources, the United Leadership tanker was at anchor off Casablanca in Morocco late last week, still looking for a buyer. Ship tracking databases had the vessel listed as ""For Orders,"" meaning its cargo does not yet have a destination. SEE MAPS: Where ISIS has taken over in Iraq . The United Leadership's limbo suggests that despite reportedly offering big discounts for its crude, the KRG is having problems offloading it. Some buyers are worried about Baghdad's threat to sue anyone who buys Iraqi oil other than through the state company. The Iraqi government has already blacklisted some agents and importers of Kurdish oil, including the Austrian company OMV. Other buyers . Reuters reported earlier this month that Russian oil company Rosneft had bought a cargo of Kurdish crude for a refinery in Germany that it co-owns. Forty one thousand tonnes of oil -- which had been trucked from Kurdistan to Ceyhan -- were carried by the Minerva Antonia tanker to Trieste in Italy and then sent by pipeline to Germany, the agency reported. Turkey says it regards the sales and the use of a Turkish port as legitimate, but also has political interests at stake in a complex regional picture. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has developed close ties with the Kurdish leadership in Iraq -- partly to dissuade it from making common cause with Turkey's restive Kurdish minority. Turkey also wants to diversify its sources of energy. It concluded a 50-year deal with the KRG this month (though details of the agreement remain sketchy). 'Playing with fire' The Iraqi government has begun legal action against Ankara at the International Court of Arbitration. Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Hussain al-Shahristani warned Turkey that it was ""playing with fire"" and ""plundering Iraq's wealth."" The United States also opposes the Kurdish sales as a further destabilizing factor in a country at risk of breaking apart. Producing or refining companies working in parts of Iraq still under the control of the central government seem to be avoiding involvement with the Kurds' unilateral action. Need for cash . But the KRG needs cash -- lots of it and quickly -- because negotiations with Baghdad over the Kurds' share of oil revenues have stalled. It has also borrowed heavily. Its monthly wage bill is more than $700 million -- that's 70% of the entire budget just going on salaries. And now that its peshmerga forces are fully mobilized in protecting Kurdistan from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, that spending is likely to rise. According to a recent study by BoA Merrill Lynch, the KRG would need monthly sales from 20 tankers holding a million barrels of oil each to make $340 million. Fraught with peril . But Denise Natali, senior research fellow at the Institute for National Strategic Studies at the National Defense University in Washington, believes the sales are fraught with peril. ""The key issue is transparency and risk-free exports,"" she told CNN. ""If something is legitimate or legal -- as both the Kurds and Turkey claim -- why then does the sale of Kurdish crude remain shrouded in so much mystery and murkiness, with transfers at sea, and buyers and prices not being identified?"" ""Any sales that may eventually occur will still be considered illicit trading by Baghdad; and that will entail litigation and brings with it reputational damage."" A price . As the government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in Baghdad tries to stave off advances by ISIS, the Kurds are in a strong bargaining position. Their peshmerga forces have been able to repulse ISIS attempts to infiltrate the Kurdish region -- and might yet help government forces go on the offensive. But there will be a price. Above all, the KRG wants the major city of Kirkuk -- which it now occupies and where Kurds, Turkmen and Sunni all live -- to be recognized as part of the Kurdish autonomous region. The KRG's President, Masoud Barzani, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Monday that Iraq was ""falling apart ... and it's obvious that the federal or central government has lost control over everything."" ""And we cannot remain hostages of the unknown,"" he added. CNN EXCLUSIVE: ""Time is here for self-determination"" A new confrontation? Peshmerga forces last week took control of the Kirkuk oilfield, strengthening the Kurds' hold over Iraq's northern oilfields. The Kirkuk oilfield is Iraq's fourth largest but badly in need of investment. But Natali, who has followed events in Iraq for more than 20 years, says the Kurds' assertiveness may end up generating a new confrontation. ""Barzani does have leverage over the Maliki government because it is so weak, and the Kurds' occupation of the Kirkuk fields does strengthen their short-term bargaining position. But such weakness and politically expedient alliances may not last forever,"" she says. ""The Maliki government may be replaced by a more inclusive and therefore stronger government in Baghdad, or a Sunni Arab state may emerge on the Kurds' doorstep that may not be amenable to Kurdish demands."" Relying on Turkey . The Kurds are also very reliant on Turkey's goodwill. ""The Iraqi Kurds are increasingly dependent on Turkey as a conduit for their oil and financing,"" Natali told CNN, ""and the close relationship between Barzani and Erdogan is largely responsible for the current arrangement. But some groups in the Turkish parliament and some Iraqi Kurdish politicians have been very critical of this opaque arrangement,"" wary of ruining relations with Baghdad and alienating Washington. For now, the Turkish and Kurdish governments appear to feel that the retaliation threatened by Baghdad can be ignored. Turkey's Energy Ministry said last week it expected another shipment of Kurdish oil to leave Ceyhan soon. According to a ship tracking database, that oil is aboard the 85,000-tonne Greek-registered United Emblem, which left the port at the weekend -- destination unknown. Where is Iraq's oil?

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- An Israeli official Saturday dismissed as ""strange"" Turkey's actions, including its decision to expel Israel's ambassador, offering seemingly unwavering remarks on the same day a top Turkish official threatened to soon bring Israel before the International Court of Justice. Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon told CNN affiliate Channel 2 that ""the entire fashion in which the Turks have acted is strange."" ""Israel must not subject its foreign policy to caprices of others,"" he added. ""The lack of cooperation does not hurt us alone, it damages the Turks as well."" Meanwhile, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told state-run news outlet TRT on Saturday that his nation will soon bring its case against Israel to the International Court of Justice. ""The ICJ is binding,"" Davutoglu said. ""So we say, if you think this way, let the ICJ decide. We will initiate the legal procedure next week."" The one-time close allies have been at odds since May 2010, when Israeli troops boarded a ship headed to the Palestinian territory of Gaza -- around which Israel has a naval blockade. The Mavi Marmara had numerous Turks aboard and was part of a flotilla loaded with humanitarian aid. Nine people were killed in the subsequent confrontation, and several Israeli troops were injured. In the latest indication of escalating tension between the two nations, Turkish officials on Friday ordered Israel's ambassador and other senior diplomats to leave their nation. Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said military agreements also have been suspended. But a senior Turkish official said that existing contracts must be honored ""no matter what"" and ""we haven't touched upon intelligence sharing."" Besides the flotilla raid incident, Turkey has strongly opposed the Jewish state's blockade of Gaza because, an official said, Palestinians have suffered from the action and other Israeli policies in the densely populated region. ""It is about time for the Israeli government to face the consequences of its illegitimate actions since it sees itself above international law and ignores human conscience and must pay a price,"" Davutoglu said. ""This price will be, above all, the loss of Turkey's friendship."" The ouster of Israeli diplomats from Turkey was cheered Saturday by Iran's foreign ministry. In a statement, reported by the semiofficial Iranian Students' News Agency, the ministry hailed the expulsion and called for more international constraints on Israel's authority in the region, particularly as it pertains to Gaza. Ayalon, in his comments Saturday, accused Turkey of trying to ""rise to unreasonable highs"" in its demands for an apology on the incident and changes in Israel's policy. Also Friday, the United Nations released the so-called Palmer report about the May 2010 raid in which it criticized Israel's actions in the incident, even as it defended the blockade of Gaza as a ""legitimate security measure."" Israel's blockade of Gaza is designed to prevent weapons from being smuggled to the territory, which is controlled by the anti-Israeli group Hamas. Gaza-based militants have been firing rockets into southern Israel and Israel has responded with military might. Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad voiced ""deep concern"" about the report's conclusion on the blockade, according to a statement from his office reported by the Palestinian Authority's official news agency WAFA. ""The fact that it considers the Israeli blockade on the Gaza Strip legal is appalling and encourages Israel to continue to violate the rights of our Palestinian people,"" Fayyad said, urging the U.N. and others in the ""international community (to) take all necessary measures to end this unjust blockade."" Ayalon, in contrast, applauded the U.N. report and said it validated Israel's actions -- including its refusal to apologize for the incident. ""The report proves there was no point in apologizing,"" he said. ""It would have led us into a slippery slope in which every factor in the region would have demanded Israel for an apology."" Turkey and Israel have been negotiating for months in an attempt to improve their faltering relationship, but those efforts have failed. The release of the report was delayed while those negotiations continued. ""We've waited and waited,"" the senior Turkish official told CNN. ""There was almost an agreement that Netanyahu agreed upon ... They're just wasting our time."" He was referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ""This makes it official. Before it was de facto, there was nothing going on, but definitely there was contact,"" said the official, who asked not to be named because of diplomatic protocol. Among other statements, Turkey signaled that it aimed to increase its presence in the region -- though Dan Halutz, a former chief of staff for the Israel Defense Forces, said one shouldn't presume the Turkish navy may now clash with their Israeli counterparts. Halutz added that savvy diplomacy may be needed to remedy the situation, saying both sides need to find a way ""to climb down"" from the escalating heights. ""The word apology is very heavy, diplomats must find a way to find the right words to use,"" he said. ""An apology is too late and would not be useful.""

"(CNN) -- The 30-page NBA document detailing the charges against Donald Sterling accuses the longtime owner of the Los Angeles Clippers of trying to persuade V. Stiviano to tell a league investigator she altered a recording and it wasn't Sterling making racist remarks on the audio, the Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday. On Monday, the NBA released a summary of the charges that could lead to NBA owners voting to strip Sterling and his wife, Shelly, of the franchise they have co-owned for 33 years. In it, the NBA said: ""In the course of the investigation into Mr. Sterling's conduct, it was discovered that relevant evidence was destroyed, false and misleading evidence was provided to the NBA's investigator, and LAC issued a false and misleading press statement regarding this matter."" The Times reported that the NBA document it obtained alleges Donald Sterling and Stiviano met on May 2, about a week after the recording containing racist remarks was released by TMZ and just before Stiviano was interviewed by Barbara Walters on ABC. ""Sterling asked Stiviano to tell the NBA that she lied in her previous meeting with the league,"" the Times reported. The newspaper also reported the NBA is prepared to argue at a June 3 meeting of the NBA Board of Governors that evidence shows that Sterling and his wife are not estranged and that she helped prepare the team's press release after the recordings were aired. Team President Andy Roeser also was in on the drafting of the statement that questioned the validity of the recording and suggested it was released by someone seeking revenge against Donald Sterling, according to the newspaper's account of the NBA document. The Times report also said the NBA suggested Roeser heard the recording on April 9, weeks before it went online, after a Clippers employee sent Roeser a copy.The document says Roeser told the employee to delete the audio file and text messages about it from a cell phone. Roeser is now on indefinite leave from the team. The paper said Sterling's lawyer, Maxwell Blecher, didn't respond to a request for comment. When asked by a CNN producer at a Tuesday news conference what evidence had been destroyed, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said he wouldn't comment on the specifics of the investigation. NBA charges Sterling, schedules June 3 vote . NBA commissioner feels certain league will oust Sterlings . Silver said on Tuesday he is confident the league will be able to force the Sterlings to sell the franchise for violating the NBA constitution. But, the new commissioner said, he would prefer the Sterlings sell the team without the league's pushing. The chances of that happening appear unlikely. Sterling, through his lawyer, has sent a letter to the league saying he won't pay a $2.5 million fine and threatening to sue if he isn't afforded due process. Shelly Sterling has said she wants to maintain her 50% stake in the franchise. ""It is their team to sell,"" Silver, who has been commissioner for three months, said ahead of the league's draft lottery. ""(They) know what the league's point of view is. If (they) wanted to sell the team on some reasonable timetable, I prefer (they) sell it than we go through this process."" On Monday, the National Basketball Association officially started the process of terminating the Sterlings' ownership rights. It sent Donald Sterling a list of charges that the billionaire real estate investor has until May 27 to answer. The league scheduled the June 3 special board of governors meeting for each side to present evidence. Silver also addressed CNN's question about a report that Sterling demanded a three-month extension, saying the 80-year-old owner needed to abide by the NBA constitution, which puts a firm timeline on the process of removing an ownership group. In order to terminate the Sterlings' franchise rights, 75% (23) of the 30 team owners would have to vote to sustain the charge and force a sale. Because Sterling is banned from any NBA activities, he is not allowed to vote, but the Clippers will have a vote, the NBA said. In the case of a forced sale, the league does have a duty to the Sterlings to sell the team for the highest possible price, Silver said. The commissioner told reporters if it gets to that point, the league will hire investment bankers to conduct the sale. The league said it has been damaged by Sterling's racist remarks to Stiviano, which were posted online in April by TMZ and aired in an interview with CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" Silver expressed confidence that eventually a new group will own the Clippers, who, led by all-stars Blake Griffin and Chris Paul, advanced to the second round of the NBA playoffs this season before losing to the Oklahoma City Thunder. Some analysts have said the team could be worth more than $1 billion. Forbes magazine lists the franchise's value at $575 million. ""We know we're doing the right thing and I know I have the owners behind me,"" Silver said. The commissioner said he is more than upset by the controversy that has many analysts focused on Sterling instead of what is happening in the playoffs. ""It was something deeper than anger,"" he said. CNN interview damages Sterling's case . In an exclusive interview with CNN's ""AC 360"" last week, Sterling talked about his relationship with Stiviano and racism in America, and he trashed Magic Johnson and other minorities. ""That's one problem I have. Jews, when they get successful, they will help their people. And some of the African-Americans, maybe I'll get in trouble again, they don't want to help anybody,"" said Sterling, who is Jewish. Some owners said privately -- and Mavericks owner Mark Cuban said publicly -- after the scandal first unfolded that it would be difficult to vote on removing an owner for a personal conversation. CNN's Rachel Nichols told Cooper on Monday that his interview has changed some minds, according to NBA insiders she had spoken with in the past week. ""If there were any owners who were concerned about should we be kicking someone out for a private tape, (they) now feel more comfortable,"" she said. ""Because Donald Sterling went on television with you and made statements that were abhorrent to so many people, they feel as if they are on much firmer ground to kick him out."" Sterling's lawyer . Last week, Sterling hired Blecher, an antitrust lawyer who has worked with him in the past, to fight the NBA. Blecher's office has had no comment to CNN. Shelly Sterling has said she wants to keep an ownership stake in the team but doesn't want to be the controlling partner. Her attorney, Pierce O'Donnell, said Monday she still hopes to resolve the ""dispute with the NBA."" ""Based on our initial assessment, we continue to believe there is no lawful basis for stripping Shelly Sterling of her 50% ownership interest in the Clippers. She is the innocent estranged spouse,"" O'Donnell said. But the NBA said Donald Sterling's remarks are deemed actions of the entire ownership group. In his interview with Cooper, Sterling repeatedly denied he is a racist but said he made a mistake making the remarks that were recorded. In the recording, which drew widespread condemnation from fans, players and the league after it appeared on TMZ, Sterling chastises Stiviano for posting pictures online of herself with African-Americans, including NBA legend Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson. He tells her not to bring Johnson to Clippers games. ""Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don't put (Magic) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me,"" he said. ""In your lousy f**ing Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people,"" he said during a different portion of the recording. Stiviano, who has largely avoided the media since the scandal began, is scheduled to appear on the ""Dr. Phil"" show on Wednesday. Sterling, who has owned the team since 1981, said he was baited into making the remarks. The Clippers' turbulent season ended last week in a 104-98 loss to Oklahoma City. The Thunder won the series four games to two. Sterling: I'm not a racist, I'm a giver . Magic Johnson: I'm going to pray for Sterling .

"Bannu, Pakistan (CNN) -- The road to Bannu city in the northwest of Pakistan is a journey through the elements. Harsh wind and rain make way for bursts of sunshine in June, a month of typically oppressive heat when illnesses such as diarrhea and typhoid are common, alongside the ever-looming specter of polio. It is in this stifling heat that hundreds of thousands of men, women and children are fleeing their homes in North Waziristan, which borders Afghanistan, to Bannu and other neighboring regions. The mass exodus began after the Pakistani army launched a full scale offensive against militants on June 15 called Zarb e Azb, or ""The Strike of The Prophet's Sword."" While the Pakistan army has been releasing a daily stream of information regarding the operation, it has come under severe criticism for failing to notify the residents of North Waziristan of an impending operation. A curfew in North Waziristan crippled the movement of individuals in the region. Military sources told CNN on condition of anonymity that the curfew had been imposed to prevent militants from fleeing, however what resulted was utter chaos for local residents. ""We waited for the signal to leave while taking shelter under trees,"" Javed Wazir, a local from the North Waziristan town of MirAli tells CNN in anguish. ""The bazaar was under fire from mortar shells and our women and children were crying in despair."" Exodus from Pakistan's troubled north presents risks, opportunities . Mass exodus . On June 18, three days after the operation officially started in North Waziristan, the army finally lifted the curfew allowing movement out of the area. What started as a mass exodus of the region's population has fast accelerated into a humanitarian crisis. According to Arshad Khan, the director of the FATA Disaster Management Authority, the number of people who have fled the military operation has now reached almost half a million, with 455,000 people scattered across various parts of Northern Pakistan. In a sports complex in the heart of Bannu city, a dust storm is creating havoc at the city's largest food distribution point for those seeking shelter. Until Tuesday it was the only food distribution point for the thousands of needy people in Bannu and its surrounding regions, and was the scene of protests airing the frustration they have experienced over the past two weeks. Wednesday saw hundreds of men, young and old, queue up outside on the streets, shielding their eyes from the grit, waiting to receive their ration of fortified wheat, iodized salt, pulses and cooking oil. A significant army presence is overseeing the distribution that has been organized by the World Food Program. Sacks of wheat are heaped in mounds in the center of the stadium and a strong hot wind is blowing cardboard cartons into the air. An old woman in a tattered burqa, clutching a wisp of paper bearing her registration number, waits for her turn to collect food. ""Three of my grandchildren died after a bomb fell on our house in the Haider khel village of North Waziristan"" she says. ""They were five, six and seven years old,"" she whispers. ""That's when we fled."" Request for more supplies . The number of families arriving has exceeded the number estimated by the WFP. According to Lola Castro, the WFP's director in Pakistan, a contingency plan had been updated to deal with a military operation in North Waziristan. However, she says Pakistani authorities only officially approached the WFP for help on June 20, five days after the strikes began. WFP had expected the families to be an average size of six but, according to Castro, families fleeing out of North Waziristan are made up of 14 people. This has lead to rations being distributed on a biweekly basis instead of the usual monthly schedule. ""We are requesting donors to provide more supplies but the situation is currently under control,"" Castro tells CNN. Malik Akbar Khan, a tribal leader and an IDP, has been volunteering at the food distribution point ever since he arrived in Bannu last week. As IDPs wheelbarrow their supplies out of the complex, he sighs and says that it is the ordinary people of North Waziristan who have had to bear the biggest brunt of the tussle between the army and the Pakistani Taliban. As the sun sets on another day of dust and desperation, he quotes the oft-repeated phrase addressing the conflict in Pakistan's northern regions. ""The army are the angels and the Taliban call themselves the companions of the holy prophet,"" he says. ""Perhaps we're the only infidels in this chaos, who suffer the most in this living hell while the other two claim that they're bound for paradise."" 'That place is like fire' There is one refuge for the hordes of people who have spilt out of North Waziristan. The army, along with funding from FDMA and the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), has set up a camp in Baka Khel, Bannu district. In the searing June heat, it sits a mere 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) from the Saigai check post, the final exit for villagers leaving North Waziristan and entering Bannu district. According to military sources, the camp became operational on June 16, a day after the military operation began. It has, however, come under severe criticism by the very people it was built to help. Many are instead choosing to stay with relatives or rent homes in cities such as Bannu, Peshawar and Dera Ismail Khan. ""When the curfew was eased we reached Bannu after a two-day journey on foot, yet we would never stay at that camp. That place is like fire, it's like fire, I would never take my family to that land of flaming heat,"" Loi Khan from the village of Boya in North Waziristan tells CNN as he stands in line to get food in Bannu. But a visit to the camp paints a different picture. Temperatures may be rising to as high as 47 degrees centigrade but efforts are underway to create what military guides to the camp call ""a model village."" There is electricity, plumbing, fancy fans that spray mist and visiting doctors. Polio workers administer vaccines to every man, woman and child entering the camp to prevent any outbreak. Yet the place is a ghost town. According to military sources only 28 families have chosen to live at the camp, a fraction of those who have left North Waziristan. It remains empty for the time being but with the month of Ramadan fast approaching and the operation not looking to end anytime soon, military officials overseeing the camp expect it to be operational and fully populated for at least two months. 450,000 displaced as Pakistan attacks militants .

"(CNN) -- Having had to request and frequently justify force requirements for combat and noncombat missions, I know that terms like ""mission creep"" and ""boots on the ground"" in connection with America's intervention in Iraq are frustratingly ill-defined and usually improperly used by those who have likely never had to plan or execute a military operation. As neither of these terms come from military doctrine, as a former commander I'd like to try to clarify what I think they mean ... and what they don't mean. Commanders are given missions. In the most recent situation in Iraq, a team of 300-plus military members -- of all ranks, and likely of many specialties -- were sent to Baghdad and Irbil to ""assess"" the situation facing the Iraqi Security Forces' ability to blunt ISIS. As part of that mission, the commanders on the ground -- Gen. Lloyd Austin at Central Command and Maj. Gen. Dana Pittard, who was sent from his posting in Kuwait to oversee operations -- conducted further analysis of the mission. They then likely assigned small teams to various Iraqi and Peshmerga units in the fight and the Operational Command Headquarters in Baghdad and Irbil to see just how bad things were. Opinion: What the U.S. can realistically do in Iraq . As part of the assessments, these teams were asked to evaluate the state of the Iraqi Security Forces and the Peshmerga, and determine what they would need to put up a fight against an increasingly powerful, and horrific, enemy. That mission changed slightly when the President saw threats against the operation centers in the two cities, and he was made aware of an emerging humanitarian crisis in Ninewa Province, near the town of Sinjar. 'Heroic' mission rescues desperate Yazidis from ISIS . The new humanitarian missions -- as well as an expansion of the requirement to ""conduct an assessment"" -- required different skill sets, and more people: intelligence analysts to track the enemy and help coordinate air strikes; logisticians to look at potential requirements needed to transport refugees; operators and fire supporters (artilleryman) who understand battlefield maneuver and fires; medical specialists to potentially treat refugees; aviation specialists who might need to coordinate ground maneuver with fast-moving jets and slower-moving helicopters delivering aid; communication specialists who can expand the satellite communication to Air, Navy, Marine, Army and Special Forces assets; and reconnaissance experts who would need to contribute to a better understanding of what was happening on the ground in the crisis areas. Were there 40,000 Yazidis -- as initially reported -- or were there 500? What were their conditions? What is the ground like for the potential of large fleets of arriving air or ground transport? What does the enemy look like near the location? Who are the Yazidis, and why does ISIS want to kill them? All of these questions were part of the commander's assessment -- the military calls them Priority Intelligence Requirements, or PIR (another one of those pesky military acronyms). The special operators who were pulled off Mount Sinjar Wednesday night were doing those kinds of missions. I can't predict with certainly what may happen next. But because I've been a part of these kinds of missions, I'm optimistic. I do know U.S. military forces are protecting the operation centers in Irbil and Baghdad; we now have a better assessment of the fighting capabilities of the ISF and Peshmerga than we had 30 days ago, and we now know a lot more about the situation on Mount Sinjar. Why does the U.S. intervene militarily in Iraq but not in Syria? Is this ""mission creep?"" I don't think so. It is what we in the military call situational assessments and a troop-to-task analysis, as the mission evolves. Are there more ""boots on the ground?"" Absolutely, even though many who wear the uniform flinch at this term (most would prefer to be called military professionals rather than be referred to as part of a uniform; this term was initially coined to help determine how long a soldier had been in theater -- ""I have 450 days boots on the ground in Iraq"" -- so we would know how much time at home we needed to provide them to recover). Now, as a private citizen and a former soldier, I'd prefer the various analysts discuss what the mission is, and how we are accomplishing it. The arbitrary use of the two confusing and ill-defined terms of ""mission creep"" and ""boots on the ground"" are not helpful in getting to the meat of the strategic issues against a determined enemy.

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN)  -- A woman on a boat died after a spotted eagle ray leaped from the water off the Florida Keys Thursday and struck her, officials said. The dead spotted eagle ray lies on the deck of a boat in Florida. The force of the blow pushed the woman backward and she died when she hit her head on the boat deck, officials said. ""It's just as freakish of an accident as I have heard,"" said Jorge Pino of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. ""The chances of this occurring are so remote that most of us are completely astonished that this happened."" The commission identified the woman as Judy Kay Zagorski, 57, of Pigeon, Michigan. The woman was seated or standing in the front of the boat as it traveled at about 25 mph out of a channel, Pino said. ""The ray just actually popped up in front of the vessel,"" he said. ""The father had not even a second to react. It was too late. It happened instantly and the woman fell backwards and, unfortunately, died as a result of the collision."" The accident happened off the coast of Marathon, about 2½ hours by car south of Miami. The woman, who was with her father and several other family members and friends, was taken to Fisherman Hospital in Marathon, where she was pronounced dead.

"(CNN) -- The head of Formula One has avoided possible conviction on bribery charges after agreeing to pay $100 million. A German court ruled Tuesday that it would accept an offer from Bernie Ecclestone to bring an early end to proceedings, which had already lasted three months. Presiding judge Peter Noll gave the 83-year-old British businessman a week to make payments of $99 million to the Bavarian state treasury and $1 million to a local charity which looks after terminally ill children. Ecclestone, who has always denied any wrongdoing, was accused of bribing a German banker eight years go over the sale of a controlling interest in the company that runs the elite division of motorsport. Under German law there is a provision to halt criminal proceedings to avoid long and costly court cases where a conviction might be difficult to achieve and after a negotiation between prosecutors and the defense. ""While charges could have been pursued against the accused, the court took into consideration the age of the accused, his health and the considerable burden of attending court in a foreign country with all the language difficulties that entails and the public attention,"" Noll said in his summing up. Ecclestone, whose fortune is valued by Forbes at over $4 billion, was asked by Noll if he could make the payment. ""Yes"" came the reply. Ecclestone's defense lawyer Sven Thomas added: ""That's do-able."" It brought down the curtain on proceedings in Munich that could have ended in a jail sentence of up to 10 years and the loss of his position at the helm of F1. Outside the court, Thomas told reporters: ""This is not about a conviction, but a cessation of the trial with no admission of guilt. ""There will be no guilty verdict whatsoever and that clearly changes the situation in terms of the evidence and legal position, otherwise the talks between the prosecution and defense would not have been possible."" The controversy dates back to 2006, when the German regional bank BayernLB sold its 47.2% stake in F1 to the current majority shareholder, CVC Capital Partners -- a private equity firm. The prosecution claimed Ecclestone paid Gerhard Gribkowsky, formerly the chief risk officer of BayernLB, a sweetener of $44 million to steer the sale to CVC, so he could remain in charge of F1. Ecclestone admitted the payment to Gribhowsky, but only after the banker threatened to make damaging claims about his tax status to Britain's HM Revenue and Customs. The case revealed that he had avoided a Â£1.2 billion ($2 billion) bill through a legal tax avoidance scheme, and had settled with British tax authorities by paying Â£10 million. He has been attending court, mostly accompanied by his wife Fabiana Flos, for two days per week while still running F1 -- a job he has held for over 40 years. Ecclestone had been warned by CVC that a guilty verdict would have resulted him being losing that coveted role, having won a civil case in Britain in February after being accused of undervaluing F1 in the sale.","German court orders Bernie Ecclestone to pay $100 million .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The remains of the first American shot down in the 1991 Persian Gulf War have been uncovered, the U.S. Department of Defense announced Sunday. Navy Capt. Michael Speicher's remains have been identified, the U.S. military announced Sunday. U.S. Navy Capt. Michael ""Scott"" Speicher was shot down in an F/A-18 Hornet on January 17, 1991, the first night of the war. The announcement early Sunday of the discovery of Speicher's remains ends more than 18 years of speculation about whether Speicher may have survived the crash and been held captive, or died in captivity in the ensuing years. ""The news that Captain Speicher's remains have been recovered is a reminder of the selfless service that led him to make the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom,"" President Obama said in a statement.  Watch: Naval aviator's remains found » . ""I am grateful to the [U.S.] Marines who pursued the information that led to Captain Speicher's recovery so that he can now come home. My thoughts and prayers are with his family, and I hope that the recovery of his remains will bring them a needed sense of closure,"" Obama said. Speicher's family thanked the military in a statement Sunday, saying Speicher ""was a brave and wonderful father, husband, and naval officer who responded without hesitation when his country needed him. ... We thank the active duty men and women whose diligence has made this happen, and hope that this process has prevented another of our service men and women from being left behind. ""We will miss him, and will never forget. Thank you for your thoughts and prayers."" An Iraqi civilian told U.S. forces in Iraq in early July about the location of the crash that killed Speicher, according to Navy Secretary Ray Mabus. U.S. Marines in Anbar province went to the site and spoke to another Iraqi  who told them he witnessed Bedouins burying Speicher's remains in the desert after the crash, the statement said. A search uncovered the remains, which were flown to Dover Air Base last week and positively identified as Speicher's by the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, the statement said. The remains included bones and skeletal fragments, and positive identification was made by comparing Speicher's dental records with a jawbone recovered at the site, the statement said. ""We send our deepest condolences to the Speicher family for the sacrifice Captain Speicher made in the service of his country,"" the top U.S. commander in Iraq, Gen. Ray Odierno, said in a statement. ""Although we cannot fully understand the sense of loss, or the pain his family has shouldered throughout the years of waiting, we hope they can find solace in his dignified and honorable return home."" Speicher was a lieutenant commander when shot down, but because his status remained uncertain, he received promotions during the past 18 years, reaching the rank of captain. He was originally listed as ""Killed-in-Action/Body-Not-Recovered"" in May 1991. That status changed in 2001 to ""Missing in Action,"" and then to ""Missing/Captured"" in 2002, based on sighting reports in Iraq. Those sightings have since been discredited. His status was changed back to MIA earlier this year. ""All the evidence that we were getting seemed to suggest that Scott was alive and being held against his will,"" Nels Jensen of Little Rock, Arkansas, a high school friend of Speicher's, told CNN. ""And you know, we never sent out a search and rescue party, and if we had ... none of this mess would probably have been necessary."" In the six years that the United States has been in Iraq for its second war, all of the many leads and alleged sightings of Speicher have been investigated and found to be false. The Speicher family has worked closely with the Navy to ensure the hunt for him would not stop. ""We reiterate our commitment to find and account for all military members and civilians who have gone missing in the service of our nation,"" Odierno said in Sunday's statement. ""We will not stop until all are found."" CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","Michael ""Scott"" Speicher was the first American shot down in Gulf war .

"(CNN) -- With a probate court trial over the sale of the Los Angeles Clippers scheduled to begin Monday, lawyers for Donald Sterling filed paperwork Thursday to have the matter moved to federal court. Donald Sterling's estranged wife, Shelly, is asking a probate judge to approve an agreement she reached with billionaire Steve Ballmer to sell the NBA team. For years, she and her husband had equal shares in the franchise through a family trust, but Shelly Sterling negotiated a deal in late May to sell the team after two doctors declared her husband was mentally incapacitated. Donald Sterling's lawyers filed a notice of removal in U.S. District Court in central California requesting the change of courts. Shelly Sterling's attorney called Thursday's legal maneuvering a ""desperate act by a desperate man."" ""This latest bad-faith maneuver on the eve of his reckoning is a cowardly ploy to do just one thing: Kill a record-setting $2 billion sale of the Clippers,"" Pierce O'Donnell said. Donald Sterling's court filing says a probate court is not the proper jurisdiction for the case. His lead attorney said his privacy rights have been violated. ""As we have stated repeatedly and from the onset of this matter, it is our contention that Donald's privacy rights have been trampled by the release of his medical records,"" attorney Bobby Samini said. ""In our request for removal to federal court, we have reasserted that Donald's rights under HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) and other federal privacy laws have been violated."" O'Donnell called the claim ""preposterous,"" saying that Donald Sterling, who is a lawyer, authorized release of his medical records as a term of the trust. Ballmer's attorney, Adam Streisand, said in a statement that he would file for emergency relief in federal court to block the move, which he called frivolous. He predicted it would delay Monday's trial as they waited for a federal judge to respond to their request. A message on the District Court's website said it would be closed Friday. Donald Sterling, 80, has been embroiled in controversy since a recording of a conversation with his friend V. Stiviano was posted online in late April. The recording included a series of racist comments. Sterling's comments, first posted on TMZ, sparked outrage among NBA players, executives and fans. NBA commissioner Adam Silver fined Sterling $2.5 million and banned him for life from the NBA. The NBA's board of governors, representatives from each of the 30 ownership groups, is scheduled to meet July 15 and could approve a sale then if the legal aspects of the deal are sorted out. For the team to be sold, either Donald Sterling would have to sign a binding term sheet or a court would have to agree Shelly Sterling acted legally in selling the team.

"Dickson, Tennessee (CNN) -- The last time Sonya's adoptive parents heard her voice, the girl was begging to return to the only home she'd ever known. ""What did you say, baby doll?"" asks Kim Hodgin, in a recording of the phone call. ""I want to you to come and get me,"" responds Sonya. She describes her biological father's home as dirty, with mold and cigarettes everywhere. The girl complains he doesn't have clean water, but says he's being nice to her. Her adoptive father tells Sonya everything is going to be OK. ""You just stay strong,"" says Dave Hodgin. 'He's a total stranger' That call took place January 30, one day after Sonya was removed from the Hodgins' home in Tennessee. Sonya, now 9, had been in the Hodgins' care since before she was 2, and was adopted by the family in 2008. Before the adoption was finalized, her birth father pleaded guilty to transporting firearms -- a felony -- and was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison. Under Tennessee law, his parental rights were automatically terminated because state law does not allow anyone incarcerated for more than 10 years to have rights to a child under the age of 8. However, her birth father later cut a deal using information he had about a homicide. His sentence was reduced to just 7Â½ years, allowing John McCaul to assert his parental rights and fight to reverse the adoption. ""She's never laid eyes on this man. He's a total stranger,"" said Kim Hodgin. Nevertheless, a court reversed Sonya's adoption in November 2009. The girl continued to live with the Hodgins as both sides fought for custody. Nearly five years later, a judge ruled Sonya should return to her biological father. Three hours after the ruling, she was gone. ""Sonya's crying her eyes out. Screaming bloody murder, 'Please don't let them do this, Daddy, please, Mama, don't let 'em take me,'"" said Dave Hodgin. ""They took her bags, and that's the last that I've seen her,"" said Kim Hodgin. A father's fight . Sonya now lives in Omaha, Nebraska -- a world away from the 40-acre farm she called home in Tennessee. CNN went to Omaha, hoping McCaul would answer questions about his daughter and his past. He said he would be open to an interview and to check with his lawyer. But his attorney said -- for now -- McCaul is forbidden by the Tennessee Department of Children's Services to speak publicly about the case and about his daughter. A spokesman for DCS released a statement. ""So many times, foster parents come to love the children who stay in their homes,"" Rob Johnson said. ""We see that every day in Tennessee. But we have to remember that the law is clear: Birth parents have the right to raise their children, and that the court system, where the final decision rests, is there to take all sides into account."" The Hodgins have filed a petition in Tennessee asking a judge to return Sonya, based on what they say is her best interest. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Friday. ""Despite repeated efforts by the foster family to terminate this child's father's rights, his parental rights have never been successfully terminated, and his daughter has now been returned to his care,"" said Lynn Coffinberry, McCaul's Tennessee lawyer.

"(CNN) -- Israel came under attack Sunday on two fronts, according to the Israeli military. In an incident near the Israeli-Syrian border, a 15-year-old Israeli civilian was killed and two others were injured, the Israeli military said. ""Today's event on the Syria border intentionally targeted Israelis. The explosion is the most serious attack against Israel in recent months,"" the Israel Defense Forces tweeted from its official account on Sunday morning. ""This is not a case of errant fire, but of an intentional attack,"" IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said. It was unclear whether the incident was connected to the Syrian civil war, but violence from that conflict has spilled over into northeastern Israel before. In response, Israel fired on nine Syrian army positions, including Syrian military headquarters and launching positions, the IDF reported. The IDF reported direct hits. On the southwestern side of the country, two rockets hit the Sha'ar Hanegev Regional Council, which borders Gaza, and an arrest was made of a ""terrorist carrying a hand grenade"" who the IDF believes ""infiltrated Israel through the Gaza security fence,"" according to the IDF's blog. In response, the IDF ""targeted four terror activity sites in Gaza,"" the blog said. Earlier Sunday, the Israeli military shot and killed two Palestinian men in the West Bank, medical officials said. Mohammad Mahmmoud Ismail, 30, was killed during a raid in Ramallah. The Israeli military said it was investigating. In addition, Ahmad Saeed Khaled, 27, was killed during a raid at a refugee camp in Nablus, a Palestinian doctor said. Khaled, a psychiatric patient, was going to morning prayers when he was shot in the legs, chest, and head, according to Dr. Ghassan Hamdan of the Palestinian medical relief society. The Israeli military said it shot a man who approached in a threatening manner in Nablus. ""The force called on the suspect to stop and after he failed to comply, they fired warning shots in the air. The troops then fired toward the suspect, after he did not cease to advance. Initial inquiry suggests that the suspect was mentally unstable,"" the IDF said. An investigation is under way. The violence comes amid an Israeli operation in response to the kidnapping of three Israeli teenagers, one of whom is reported to be a U.S. citizen. The Palestinian medical sources say five people have died since the onset of the operation: four from Israeli military fire, and a fifth from a heart attack during a raid on his West Bank home. An additional 463 Palestinians, including children, had been arrested or detained as of Sunday morning, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Society.

"Peosta, Iowa (CNN) -- President Barack Obama laced into his conservative Republican congressional critics Tuesday, accusing them of putting partisan political concerns before the country's interests. Appearing before a crowd of farmers and small-business owners in the presidential battleground state of Iowa, Obama called on Congress to help boost an anemic economy by passing an extension of the payroll tax cut and a new road construction bill, among other things. ""America is going to come back from this recession stronger than before,"" the president declared. But I ""need your help sending a message to Congress"" that ""it's time to put politics aside and get something done,"" he said. Elements in Congress refuse to ""put country ahead of faction,"" Obama said. It is time to ""put country ahead of party and put the next generation ahead of the next election. That's what I'm fighting for."" Obama's latest salvo against tea party-backed Republicans came in the midst of the president's three-day Midwestern bus tour, ostensibly meant to promote administration's new rural economic development initiatives. The president is scheduled to discussed a number of political and economic issues during a one-on-one interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday afternoon. Among other things, the administration is pushing $350 million in additional Small Business Administration funding to rural small businesses over the next five years. The White House is also working to promote greater venture capital investment in rural startups and using more than 2,800 U.S. Agriculture Department offices nationwide to help publicize job opportunities. Loans from the Department of Health and Human Services are being made available to help recruit staff members to 1,300 rural hospitals. The initiatives are based on recommendations from the White House Rural Council, which Obama created in June to report on rural America's economic climate. Obama's trip to Peosta, Iowa, followed stops in both Minnesota and Iowa on Monday. On Wednesday, the president will host a pair of town hall forums in his home state of Illinois. The first family is then scheduled to depart for a vacation in Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, on Thursday. Obama's remarks on Tuesday echoed comments he made Monday, in which he slammed partisan politics and called on lawmakers to prioritize economic growth. ""The problem we have is not with our country. The problem is that our politics is broken,"" he said at a town hall meeting in Decorah, Iowa. ""There are a whole host of ideas that we could be implementing right now that traditionally have had bipartisan support. The only thing that is preventing us from passing them is that there are some folks in Congress who think that doing something in cooperation with me, or this White House, that that somehow is bad politics."" The president said he will release a detailed plan to boost the economy, create jobs and control the country's deficit when Congress returns to Washington in September. He began his tour with a town hall meeting before a supportive crowd at a riverside Minnesota park in Cannon Falls. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Preibus on Monday blasted the Midwest swing as nothing more than a campaign event thinly disguised as an extended public policy discussion. ""He's spending taxpayers' dollars on a bus tour disguised as some kind of economic event for the country when we all know that it's a campaign event paid for by the taxpayers,"" Preibus said. Earlier, the Republican National Committee issued a ""briefing book"" on the trip made to resemble one produced by the administration in which it mockingly described the trip as ""a totally non-political taxpayer-funded administration event that just happens to criss-cross several battleground states critical to the president's reelection."" GOP presidential hopeful Mitt Romney's campaign posted a message to his website that was similarly critical. ""During his Magical Misery bus tour this week, it is unlikely President Obama will speak with unemployed Americans, to near-bankrupt business owners or to families struggling to survive in this economy,"" the statement reads. ""He is more interested in campaigning in swing states than working to solve the economic crisis that is crushing the middle class."" Administration officials defended the trip last week, saying it was not political in nature. It was meant as an opportunity for Obama to visit with residents in their own communities to talk about national economic policy, they said. ""That isn't just an appropriate thing for a president to do, it's something that a president should do,"" Josh Earnest, Obama's principal deputy press secretary, said Friday. At the Cannon Falls meeting, Obama hit on recent themes blaming economic problems in part on turmoil in the Mideast, debt problems in Europe and the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, but he said the biggest problem was intransigence in Washington, particularly among Republicans unwilling to accept any tax increases to help solve the nation's budget problems. He also touched on education, health care reform and other topics. CNN's Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.

"(CNN) -- A father and daughter weren't going to just sit there when they discovered their home was being burglarized. Kevin Smith, a plastic surgeon from Houston, was just arriving home from a business trip on Friday when he and his daughter saw a group of apparent thieves pulling out of their driveway in a red pickup. His 22-year-old daughter, Alana, immediately worried over the whereabouts of her sister, who she left at home when she went to pick up her father from the airport. They called her sister Kara's cell phone while sitting in their car, but there was no answer. Fearing the worst, father and daughter took off in pursuit of the suspects' truck -- something authorities say you should never do. ""I locked eyes on them, and their eyes were terrified. I knew that they had done something terrible,"" Alana said in an interview with CNN. ""I didn't know what happened to my sister, and I didn't know if she was OK. My instinct was this was my only chance to get these guys."" Kevin Smith recorded the chase on his cell phone while his daughter drove their car after the suspects. But he captured more than just a speedy car chase down their neighborhood road. The driver of the pickup noticed the pair trailing behind, and put the truck into reverse, crashing into the father and daughter's vehicle. The suspects then threw their car into reverse again, smashing into the pair's Audi sedan a second time. In the cell phone video, Alana can be heard asking her father, ""Dad, now what do I do?"" after the car turns off during one of the collisions. He tells her to turn the car back on. ""I wasn't scared. I just wanted to catch them,"" she said. They chased the truck for several more miles until the suspects turned their vehicle around and aimed it right at the father and daughter. ""It was just like in the movies,"" Kevin Smith said. ""It was really eerie. At the end of this road, you see the truck turn around and you see the red truck popped out of the dust and head right turn towards us."" The truck smashed into their Audi, sending the would-be robbers and the father and daughter into a nearby ditch. The father then called the police. Minutes later, authorities arrived on the scene, arresting two of the three men, who now are facing criminal charges. The Houston Police Department did not provide additional information. ""I'm proud of my daughter,"" Kevin Smith said. ""As a father, you really don't know how you raised your kid until they get older and you see how they can handle themselves. I don't want her to be cavalier, but I want her to know I am proud."" He believes the suspects may be responsible for a series of burglaries that have been plaguing his south Houston neighborhood. ""I'm tired of these people taking advantage of us. We're not going to tolerate it anymore in our neighborhood,"" he said. As for Kara, the daughter who was left at home, she was at the gym during the incident and wasn't able to answer her cellphone while she was working out. Alana, who is going to law school in the fall, says the whole experience was unprecedented, but she feels blessed and fortunate that she and her sister are alright. ""I needed to do this for my neighborhood and my family,"" she said. Smith suffered no injuries after the incident, and his daughter was released later from the hospital after being checked in for whiplash. Their car suffered front and back-end damage, and they were able to retrieve the television, laptops and a myriad of other possession that were stolen from their home.

"(CNN) -- Former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman was denied a new trial Friday and resentenced to 6½ years in prison for his role in bribery, conspiracy, fraud and obstruction of justice, the Justice Department announced. At a hearing Friday in a federal courtroom in Montgomery, District Judge Mark Fuller said Siegelman would serve the 78 months behind bars, plus receive three years of supervised release and a $50,000 fine. Siegelman's contentious prosecution included a jury verdict of guilt on seven charges in 2006. An appeals court threw out two of the charges but upheld five counts, and the Supreme Court refused to hear his appeal. Siegelman served less than a year in prison before he was released on bail in 2008 after the appellate court tossed two of the charges. But on Tuesday, he asked for a new trial. ""The District Court reviewed and denied all of Siegelman's various claims for a new trial prior to his resentencing (Friday),"" the Justice Department said. Siegelman stands convicted of bribery, conspiracy and honest services mail fraud arising from a scheme in which HealthSouth CEO Richard Scrushy paid $500,000 for a seat on the state regulatory board governing HealthSouth. Siegelman was found guilty of obstruction of justice stemming from an investigation of an alleged pay-to-play scheme with another Alabama businessman. ""The outcome of this case reflects the unflagging commitment of the Department of Justice to hold public officials accountable for corruption,"" Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer said in a statement.","Don Siegelman convicted in scheme in which CEO paid $500,000 for board seat .

An editorial published in the People's Daily says ""dogs are friends as well as food"" and calls for calm and understanding from both dog-eaters and dog-lovers. The annual dog meat and lychee festival held in Yulin, Guizhou to celebrate the summer solstice has sparked heated debate between animal rights activists and dog meat-eaters. Dog meat is traditionally considered a delicacy in parts of China, including the southern Chinese province of Guizhou where the festival dates back hundreds of years. Animal rights activists say dogs are part of the daily diet here, with an estimated 10,000 dogs killed for the festival alone, their meat selling for up to $6 a kilogram. The festival has triggered outrage amongst pet-lovers in China, who deem the festival cruel and unethical. The state-run People's Daily says the physical clashes between dog-eaters and lovers that have been reported are regrettable situations that should be avoided. The editorial cites a series of works created by the celebrated monk Master Hong Yi and pioneering ink cartoonist Feng Zikai, in which images and poetry are used to persuade people not to harm living things. The works are held as an example of a peaceful way for activists to convince dog-eaters of their position. The writer also cites a personal childhood anecdote in which his uncle decided to bury the dead family dog instead of eating it, despite the lack of meat in the family's diet at the time. His uncle explained that the dog had been with the family for so long that it was ""half a man."" But not everyone shares this view of dogs, the writer emphasizes. ""Truly civilized behavior is to be endeared by opposing opinions and to respect ecological diversity, don't you think?"" the piece asks. The Global Times, an English newspaper published by the People's Daily, explains that the majority of Chinese society is not keen on eating dog meat, while anti-dog meat sentiment is originally a Western influence that is growing alongside the trend of keeping pets in China's urban areas.","Dog meat and lychee are eaten to celebrate the summer solstice in Guizhou .

"New York (CNN) -- Pro basketball is a staple of American athletics, taking its place with Major League Baseball and the National Football League as one of the pre-eminent U.S. sports leagues. And it's big business, too, pumping tens of millions of dollars into the U.S. economy. So the owner of the Brooklyn Nets raised eyebrows this week when he said he planned to transfer ownership of the team to a company in Russia -- at a time when tension between the U.S. and Russia is at its highest level since the end of the Cold War. That raised two questions: Will it happen? Does it matter? The billionaire owner, Mikhail Prokhorov, Monday reiterated his year-old intention to transfer the Brooklyn Nets ownership base to Russia, but has since toned down his rhetoric. ""This is a long process which may or may not come to fruition and nothing is imminent,"" Prokhorov's company, Onexim Sports and Entertainment, which owns the NBA basketball team, said in a statement released via the Brooklyn Nets. ""Of course, no steps in this direction could or would be taken without the full knowledge and approval of the NBA."" On Monday, the 48 year-old Russian national told reporters in Moscow, ""I have already stated that I will transfer the basketball club (under the Russian jurisdiction),"" according to Russian news agency ITAR-Tass. Not so fast, the NBA said, telling CNN the transfer has yet to begin. ""The Nets are owned by Mikhail Prokhorov through a U.S.-based company,"" Mike Bass, executive vice president of NBA communications, told CNN. ""We have received no official application, nor is there a process under way through our office to transfer the ownership of the Nets to another company."" If an application to change ownership was submitted by the Nets, 75% of NBA team owners -- or 23 of 30 -- would have to approve the move, Bass said. He said that the NBA's Board of Governors (the 30 team owners) would have to decide whether there are any issues with the transfer of ownership application. Currently, the NBA has no rules prohibiting a foreign company from owning an NBA team. The back-and-forth comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin pushes Russian businessmen to ""de-offshore"" companies owned abroad. Last week, Putin stressed the importance of bringing the companies home and making them pay Russian taxes to help grow the economy, according to the Kremlin website. ""Entrepreneurs need to understand their responsibility,"" Putin told a group of Russian businessmen last week. ""Our priority stance is that Russian companies have to be registered here, in their home country and have a transparent ownership structure."" Onexim Group is described as a private investment holding company that owns or manages various metals companies, financial companies and media outlets, as well as the Nets, according to the site. In recent weeks, Washington has imposed sanctions on senior Russian officials and what officials called ""cronies"" of Putin, as well as a bank, after warning Putin against annexing Crimea from Ukraine. President Barack Obama also signed an executive order that authorizes his administration to target Russian companies vital to the economy, including financial services, energy, metals and mining. When asked about the idea of a basketball team transferring its ownership to be based in Russia, the State Department declined to comment. Onexim says the discussions to move the Brooklyn Nets under Russia's jurisdiction began in the spring of 2013. At the time, Prokhorov intended to run for public office and the move was an attempt to comply with Russian laws regarding political candidates. ""Mikhail was not in any way tying it to the current political situation,"" Ellen Pinchuk, director for international projects at the communications adviser group Mikhailov & Partners, said this week. Prokhorov called the move ""an outstanding opportunity to use NBA technologies for the step-by-step development of basketball in Russia,"" according to ITAR-Tass. Alexander Kliment, director of Russia research and emerging markets at Eurasia Group, a global political risk and consulting firm, said there is a basic agreement between Putin and oligarchs permitting them to make money as long as they stay out of government. They're also expected to comply with government demands, he said. ""Prokhorov is falling into line with the Kremlin's broader emphasis on returning the assets of Russia's wealthiest businessmen back to Russia,"" Kliment said. ""There's a political dimension to that: to ensure that the wealthiest are as dependent on him as possible and as independent of the west as possible."" Russia's oligarchs always had to balance keeping assets at home versus abroad, Kliment said, but pressure has been increasing. ""For a long time the political risk of keeping assets in Russia appeared to be higher, but in the past month that has shifted because of pressure from both the Kremlin and the White House,"" Kliment added. Courtney Brunious, associate director of the USC Marshall Sports Business Institute, said such a move in the sports world could be complicated by the current political situation. ""Any type of moves that take into consideration the residency of who owns the team would be impacted by whatever laws in the country in which they reside and any type of sanctions that currently or could potentially be placed on a country, such as Russia,"" Brunious said. If NBA team owners gather to discuss the transfer they have to consider the best interest of the league and owners, as well the ramifications of ownership change, he said. ""Anyone that has a background, like Prokhorov, that could be aligned with sanctions, needs to be taken seriously,"" Brunious said. He added: ""The NBA as a whole wants draw from a large audience. They want to focus on the talent and competition on the court, they don't necessarily want to link up with geopolitical issues."" ""Unless the move raises issues with the league or the U.S. government, Nets fans probably shouldn't be worried. As long as the Nets ownership group is financially sound and not running afoul of those groups, the team won't likely feel much of an impact,"" Brunious said. Prokhorov became principal owner of the Nets in 2010. He bought 80% of the team, as well as a 45% stake in the Barclays Center, the iconic new facility the team has called home since 2012. The Brooklyn Nets are worth $780 million, the 5th most valuable franchise in the NBA, according to Forbes. Prokhorov -- worth $10.4 billion, the 120th richest person in the world and the 11th richest in Russia, according to Forbes -- gained his wealth through minerals and metal investments in the years after the fall of communism in the early 1990s. He's got a reputation as a financial sage. ""I like business, it's my profession,"" Prokhorov told CNN's Matthew Chance in 2011. ""I spend, like, 15 hours a day in the office. It's the great joy in my life, and I never think about money."" Prokhorov has shown interest in politics in the past, and even ran for president in Russia as an independent against Putin in 2012. At the time, some saw him as too close to the regime in power. Many Russians suspected the Kremlin put Prokhorov up to garner some legitimate votes without being a true threat to Putin, giving the impression that the contest was fair. CNN's Leigh Remizowski, Quand Thomas, Jillian Martin and Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report.","Russian billionaire owner of Nets considers ownership move to Russian jurisdiction .

"(CNN) -- In the aftermath of Haiti's devastating earthquake in January 2010, a group of dedicated amputees who share a love of soccer emerged as a symbol of survival and rebuilding. Team Zaryen, Haiti's first all-amputee soccer team, travels to the United States this week for its first tour. The team will visit Washington D.C. and New York to conduct clinics and demonstration matches throughout the week as part of the ""Haitian Inspiration Tour."" Sponsored by the Knights of Columbus and the health service organization Project Medishare, Team Zaryen was formed by Capitan Wilfred Macena, after he received a prosthetic limb thanks to the help of the Healing Haiti's Children Program. Macena was able to quickly recover and return to his athletic lifestyle after regaining full mobility, and formed the soccer team of other amputee patients in September 2010. The team coined the name Zaryen, which in Creole means tarantula, because the spider is known to continuously attack regardless of its wound. All 10 teammates received prosthetic limbs and a year of physical therapy from the same program. The team was formed as a way to encourage others to overcome the stigma associated with amputees and as an encouragement to others who have lost a limb, according to the tour's website. The team's tour begins Monday when it participates in a soccer clinic with wounded American service members at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. It will then spend two days at an RFK Stadium practice field, current home of Washington D.C.'s professional soccer team D.C. United. The tour was formed in part as a way for Team Zayren to give back to the American military for their relief efforts following the earthquake . The team will also offer brief demonstrations of amputee soccer during professional U.S. soccer games in Washington D.C. and New York during the week.","The team is comprised of players who lost limbs during the Haiti quake .

"(CNN) -- Declaring himself frustrated with political fighting in Congress, President Barack Obama on Thursday blamed some of the nation's continuing economic troubles on government inaction and urged Americans to tell their elected representatives in Washington to pass bills that will create jobs. In an energetic speech to workers at a Holland, Michigan, hybrid car battery plant helped by government stimulus funds, Obama said the U.S. economy and American workers are capable of being the best in the world, but were being held back by political stalemate in Congress. ""There is nothing wrong with our country. There is something wrong with our politics,"" Obama declared to applause. Last week's first-ever downgrade of the U.S. credit rating by Standard & Poor's ""could have been entirely avoided if there had been a willingness to compromise in Congress,"" the president said, adding: ""It didn't happen because we didn't have the capacity to pay our bills. It happened because Washington doesn't have the capacity to come together and get things done."" ""You hear it my voice. I'm frustrated,"" Obama said, referring to what he called the ""worst kind of partisanship"" and the ""worst kind of gridlock"" in Congress. While Obama called on Democrats and Republicans to put the welfare of the country ahead of partisan gains, his comments appeared aimed at GOP opponents accused by Democrats of pursuing a narrow political agenda in the House and stalling progress in the Senate. Citing ""things we can do right now to accelerate job growth,"" Obama complained that ""the only thing keeping us back is our politics."" He called for Congress to immediately approve measures that he said were ""ready to go,"" such as a payroll tax cut extension, a road construction bill and free trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama. ""The only thing preventing these bills from being passed is the refusal of some in Congress to put country ahead of party,"" Obama said. He called on people to tell their senators and Congress members to ""stop sending out press releases, start passing bills,"" adding: ""They've got to hear from you."" Obama also promised more proposals in coming weeks intended to stimulate job growth, but he acknowledged that Congress also has to address mounting federal budget deficits. The debt ceiling agreement passed by Congress last week and signed by Obama cuts government spending by more than $900 billion and creates a special congressional committee to work out another $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction steps. Despite the agreement, the subsequent S&P downgrade and global economic instability has caused wild fluctuations on Wall Street this week. Repeating his call for a comprehensive approach to deficit reduction, Obama said the country needs to continue investing in education, clean energy and other vital areas while also ensuring that entitlement benefits for senior citizens are protected. That means a balanced approach to deficit reduction in which wealthy corporations and individuals are paying their fair share toward a solution, he said to applause. ""Everybody's got to chip in,"" he said. ""That's fair. You learn it in kindergarten."" It was Obama's second visit to Holland, an emerging hub for hybrid car battery technology. Until recently, it was best known for sugar-white Lake Michigan beaches and its annual tulip festival. Obama toured a Johnson Controls-Saft plant that was built with a $299 million grant from his administration's 2009 economic stimulus program and now expects to employ 500 people when fully operational. Before the speech, Obama got some good news when the Labor Department reported the number of first-time filers for unemployment benefits fell last week, dipping below 400,000 for the first time in four months. The figure of 395,000 beat economists' forecasts of 409,000, according to consensus estimates from Briefing.com. ""It's a good sign,"" said Brett Ryan, U.S. economist with Deutsche Bank. ""The trend in claims is going to be one of the most important things we watch over the next few weeks or so, to gauge whether we're entering another recession."" However, the unemployment rate remains above 9%, and Obama's visit to Holland was intended to highlight his job-creation policies. Both Johnson and Korea's LG Chem have built battery plants in Holland. LG Chem received $150 million from the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act, and Obama appeared at the groundbreaking of its 200-worker plant in 2010. LG employee Shane Vander Jagt told CNN that the plant's future was ""very bright."" ""This technology is not a fad,"" said the 34-year-old Vander Jagt, who said he has been laid off ""more than once"" in the past few years. ""It's only going to grow."" Holland, a city of 34,000 located 30 miles southeast of Grand Rapids, had an unemployment rate of 13.2% in July 2009. It's currently 9%. Even without stimulus funds as an enticement, the area has been drawing other players in the industry. Switzerland-based fortu PowerCell is building an advanced battery plant in Muskegon, 30 miles north of Holland -- a decision company spokeswoman Deb Muchmore called ""good common sense."" Michigan ""is the automotive capital of the world,"" Muchmore said. ""Its work force is manufacturing-savvy (and has) tremendous expertise with all things mobility."" Muskegon's unemployment rate peaked at 15.7% in July 2009, and it was hit again by the 2010 closure of a paper mill that added hundreds more to the unemployment rolls. By June 2011, that figure had fallen to 10.8%. CNNMoney's Annalyn Censky contributed to this report.","NEW: President Obama says he is frustrated with Congress .

"(CNN) -- Prince Albert II may be head of state in the principality of Monaco, but when it comes to the Formula One street circuit of Monte Carlo there is only one king: Ayrton Senna. The Brazilian driver won a record six times at the legendary grand prix during a glittering career which included three world championship triumphs and 41 race victories. ""As a competitor, from the point of view of all or nothing, he ranks up there at the top,"" fellow world champion and former on-track rival Nigel Mansell told CNN. ""Sadly, as with so many other drivers in the history of the sport, he was prematurely taken away from us."" Monaco: Where exhaust fumes and foie gras mix . Senna's tragic death aged 34 at the San Marino Grand Prix in 1994 devastated millions in his homeland, and his passing led to three days of national mourning. Monaco's narrow twists and turns are regarded as one of motorsport's toughest tests, but Senna seemed to relish the technical challenge and excelled when pushing his car to the absolute limit around the harbor's winding streets. He began his love affair with the track in 1984, with a dazzling display of driving talent during his rookie season with British team Toleman. Senna qualified 13th for a grand prix blighted by torrential rain in an unspectacular car. It was only his sixth race and one which would mark the first step on his ascent into F1's pantheon of greats. Ayrton Senna's greatest F1 moments . ""Winning the wet races, as Ayrton did, is all part of the challenge,"" current McLaren driver and 2008 world champion Lewis Hamilton told British newspaper The Times in 2008. ""He proved he was the best by destroying everyone ... Doing it (at Monaco) is even harder. This track does bring out the true driver and the best drivers do rise to the top."" If what Hamilton said is true, then the legendary circuit unearthed its most precious jewel among the monsoon-like conditions of June 3, 1984. The downpour was laying waste to a distinguished field, with Nelson Piquet, already a double world champion, and Englishman Mansell both out of proceedings inside the first 15 laps. After Senna unleashed a ruthless surge of speed to burn past future championship winner Niki Lauda and move into second place, the 24-year-old had McLaren's race leader Alain Prost in his sights. With Senna tearing through the deluge and gaining on the Frenchman at a rate of three seconds per lap, the race officials came to Prost's rescue. The contest was brought to a premature end after 31 laps, seconds before Senna was able to overhaul Prost, and it heralded the beginning of a fierce rivalry between the two future teammates. Despite an explosive start to his Monaco career, it would be another three years until Senna secured his maiden victory on the street circuit while racing for Lotus in 1987. The South American's mastery of Monte Carlo's winding roads was coming to the fore, and the full extent of his ability was displayed during the 1988 event -- in his debut season as Prost's colleague at McLaren, when he won his first world title. ""Managing two highly-motivated sportsmen such as Ayrton and Alain was always going to be a challenging task,"" former team principal Ron Dennis told CNN. ""One of Ayrton's unique and great qualities was that he was determined, he wanted to be the best and nothing was about to stand in his way."" It was Senna's infatuation with supremacy which contributed to a legendary qualifying performance, with the sport's official website claiming he ""became a passenger on a surreal ride into the unknown."" Despite driving identical cars, Senna was able to record a lap two seconds faster than his French teammate to clinch pole position in mesmeric fashion. ""Ayrton had such an evident natural talent,"" said Dennis, who is now executive chairman of the McLaren group. ""He was physically fit to a level that caught so many of his opponents off-guard. ""He had an admirable obsession with being the best, a superiority for which he was both known and loved."" Victory seemed a formality for Senna, who had built a 55-second lead over Prost with only 11 laps remaining. Determined to push himself harder and harder, the race leader lost control and smashed into the wall at the eighth turn on the track -- a corner known as Portier. ""I think it is always surprising,"" Mansell, who also crashed out that year, told CNN of Senna's failure to win in '88. ""But at Monaco the slightest mistake can turn into a big mistake, and Ayrton made a very small mistake and paid the penalty of not finishing."" It gifted Prost a fourth Monaco triumph in five years, but Senna would bounce back to emphatically trump his nemesis. In 1989, aged 29, he secured a second Monte Carlo crown and began a sequence of domination which saw him claim five successive editions of the marquee race. Arguably his toughest -- and most fortuitous -- win came in 1992, when the Williams of Mansell had claimed maximum points in the year's first five races and was blazing a trail towards world championship glory. ""With Piquet, Prost and Senna, as well as myself and many other drivers, it was very difficult in the late 1980s/early 1990s to win,"" Mansell said. ""With competition being at its strongest, and having so many other committed drivers, it was a very satisfying experience when you beat them."" Mansell was on course to once again defeat his rivals until disaster struck with seven laps remaining, when the world championship leader was forced into the pits. Senna took control but, on fresh, quicker tires and with a superior car, Mansell quickly closed the gap on the new leader and furiously tried to overhaul him. A dogged Senna used every inch of his McLaren to defend the Williams' onslaught and he held on to temporarily derail Mansell's championship charge. Mansell was exhausted when he took to the podium, but the 31-time race winner is not bitter when reflecting on the experience. ""Incredible excitement combined with disappointment,"" said Mansell when asked what emotions he experienced 23 years ago. ""The rules then made it incredibly exciting, and I think the last closing laps were fantastic for the fans and for F1."" So what was it that made Senna a seemingly perfect match for Monaco? ""At times Ayrton had a better team, a better car and reliability, which is all you need at Monaco,"" said Mansell. ""But above all you have to have that total commitment and concentration to do the job. Any great race-car driver will tell you that driving a car on a knife edge is sometimes very difficult."" Two weeks after Senna's passing at Imola, Ferrari's Michael Schumacher assumed the mantel of Monte Carlo maestro by claiming the first of his five victories on the Mediterranean coast. The German can match Senna's all-time record by guiding his Mercedes over the line in first position at this weekend's race but -- at the age of 42 -- the seven-time world champion's best days are certainly behind him. Senna's Monte Carlo achievements look set to be beyond even F1's most successful driver. Proof, if it was needed, that the Brazilian remains the king of Monaco.","Ayrton Senna won Formula One's Monaco Grand Prix a record six times .

"(CNN) -- Former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, who is serving time in prison for crimes committed during his rule, was taken to a hospital, Panamanian police said Sunday. He was moved to the Panama City hospital because of hypertension and a possible stroke, they said, citing his medical team. He is 77. Noriega returned to Panama late last year, nearly 22 years after U.S. forces forcibly removed him from office. He previously served time in French and American prisons. He was convicted in absentia in Panama, where officials want Noriega to face justice in the killings of Hugo Spadafora, his political opponent, and at least one other person. For almost 20 years, Noriega was a major player in a country of critical regional importance to the United States because of its location on the Panama Canal, the key strategic and economic waterway between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans on the narrow isthmus linking the Americas. Amid growing unrest in Panama, then-U.S. President George H.W. Bush ordered the invasion of Panama in December 1989, saying Noriega's rule posed a threat to U.S. lives and property. Noriega fled his offices and tried to seek sanctuary in the Vatican Embassy in Panama City. He surrendered in January 1990 and was quickly escorted to the United States for civilian trial. Noriega was indicted in the United States on charges of racketeering, laundering drug money and drug trafficking. He was accused of having links to Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar's notorious Medellin cartel and, in the process, amassing a multimillion-dollar fortune. He was convicted of drug trafficking and other crimes in the United States. While in U.S. custody, he suffered from prostate cancer and a stroke. In 2010, a French court sentenced Noriega to seven years in prison for laundering 2.3 million euros ($2.9 million) through banks there. A French court authorized his extradition to Panama.","Manuel Noriega was moved because of hypertension, possible stroke, police say .

"(CNN) -- Maria de Villota, who has been a pioneer for women in Formula One, has died aged 33. The Spaniard, who was a reserve driver for the Marussia team during the 2012 season, was found dead in a hotel room in Seville, according to local media reports. De Villota, the daughter of former F1 driver Emilio de Villota, was in Seville to launch her autobiography. ""Dear friends: Maria has left us,"" read a statement from her family on De Villota's official Facebook page. De Villota's first outing in an F1 car proved to be her last.

After the Senate vote, the ""welcome"" sign with Blagojevich's face, which visitors saw as they entered the Capitol in Springfield, was quickly brought down. Maintenance crews arrived, first removing the gold nameplate with Blagojevich's name. Using drills and a ladder, they then brought down the 5-foot-high sign to make the official change.

"(CNN) -- George Zimmerman, who sold his first painting on eBay for a whopping $100,000, is at it again. And this time his subject is the woman who charged him with second-degree murder: Special Prosecutor Angela Corey. The painting, a swirl of bright red and yellow, shows Corey with her fingers pinched. The caption, in all caps, says, ""I have this much respect for the American judicial system - Angie C."" It's an artistic depiction of a much-reprinted photograph of Corey from the news conference when she announced the charge against Zimmerman. CNN left phone and email messages with the prosecutor's office for a response. Zimmerman's brother, Robert, posted a photo of the painting on Twitter on Wednesday night. ""Very proud to introduce @TherealGeorgeZ 's latest...""Angie"". Sale info & details available tomorrow."" Last month, the former neighborhood watchman listed an original painting on eBay: An 18-by-24-inch canvas featuring a blue, waving American flag with the words, ""God, one nation, with liberty and justice for all"" emblazoned across it. The winning bid on it was $100,099.99. ""Everyone has been asking what I have been doing with myself. I found a creative, way to express myself, my emotions and the symbols that represent my experiences,"" the item description for that painting read. ""My art work allows me to reflect, providing a therapeutic outlet and allows me to remain indoors."" Zimmerman has been in and out of the spotlight since his July acquittal in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in 2012. In December, Florida prosecutors said they would not charge Zimmerman after a domestic dispute with his girlfriend in November resulted in his arrest. Previously, he was stopped several times for speeding. Zimmerman told a judge in November he had $150 to his name and was $2.5 million in debt. Zimmerman won't be charged in domestic dispute, prosecutor says .","The new painting depicts prosecutor Angela Corey .
