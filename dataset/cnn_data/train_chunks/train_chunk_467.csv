"By . Beth Stebner . Last updated at 2:29 AM on 6th January 2012 . Transgendered men have been in a limbo of sorts for years, identifying with males and looking like them, but having the sexual organs of - and needing treatment for - the female reproductive system. Because of these dilemmas, many female-to-male transgender have postponed going to the doctor to avoid being the subject of belittling, unprofessional conduct from both doctors and nurses, and in two per cent of cases, violence and physical harassment from staff. But a board focusing on female health is hoping to change all that by advising OB/GYNs across the country to create a more accepting environment for the community. Common bond: Both Chaz Bono (left) and Rajee Narinesingh (right) are members of the transgender community. Some are afraid to go to a doctor for fear of discrimination or ridicule . The Sun-Sentinel has reported at the case of transgender couple S.F. Makalani-MaHee, who was born as a female but lives as a male, and his partner Rajee Narinesingh, a transgendered woman. Mr Makalani-MaHee told the paper that he always felt a sense of dread when going to the gynaecologist, he still has a woman’s sexual organs, which brings a slew of uncomfortable emotions from many doctors. ‘The ignorance runs its course,’ he said. ‘A lot of us have avoided these types of experiences.’ Mr Makalani-MaHee has avoided them by not going to a gynaecologist in more than a decade. His partner, 44-year-old Rajindra Narinesingh, too, has been on the receiving end of discrimination. She has gotten her estrogen injections from a general practitioner rather than a gynaecologist. Daddy dearest: Thomas Beatie, a transgender man with a woman's reproductive organs, was refused treatment from no less than eight doctors . She told the paper she wanted to complete her transformation to a woman by getting gender reassignment surgery. She’s put it off in part because of the cost, but said she’s also afraid of being discriminated against. According to the Sun-Sentinel, nearly 30 per cent of the transgender community delays treatment because they fear discrimination. The community makes up around three per cent of the U.S. population – around 9million Americans. 'By increasing the number of OB/GYNs . providing care to transgender patients, we can help improve the overall . health of the transgender community.' -Dr Eliza Buyers . Seeing the obvious dangers in patient’s health, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has been making strides to improve access to health care. The College Committee on Health Care for Underserved Women helped develop new curriculum for what they call ‘a small though substantial population.’ They recognise the word transgender is an umbrella term ‘that includes people whose gender identity and/or gender expression differs from their assigned sex at birth. Winds of change: Dr Eliza Buyers says it's time for the transgender community to feel comfortable going to the doctor . ‘Female-to-male, male-to-female, . cross-dresses, bi-gendered, and intersex are the major groups that fall . under the term transgender,’ the report said. The goal is to increase available care to transgendered people. Dr Eliza Buyers, a former member of the committee, said: ‘It would be wonderful if all transgender patients had the resources to be seen in a specialised clinic, but the reality is that many forgo care because they don’t. She continued: ‘By increasing the number of OB/GYNs providing care to transgender patients, we can help improve the overall health of the transgender community.’ In many cases, she said, men may need breast cancer and cervical cancer screenings if they take estrogen or had sexual reassignment surgery. Transgender friendly: Dr Buyers suggests one way to help transgender patients feel more at ease is to create more unisex waiting rooms . For female-to-male patients who haven’t had surgery, reproductive organ screenings of their breasts, ovaries, and uterus are required. Dr Buyers said that all transgender individuals should have access to STI screenings, Pap smears, and other routine procedures as well. ‘We need to make our offices settings that treat all patients with respect,’ Dr Buyers said. ‘We want the transgender community to know that we, as OB/GYNs, care about their health.’ Some offices are making their waiting rooms more transgender friendly and adding inclusive questions to medical histories. Even so, board-certified methods for treating transgender patients are still a little-explored area. In 2008, the 'pregnant man' Thomas Beatie case caused shouts and murmurs across the country. A pregnant Mr Beatie told Oprah: ‘I actually opted not to do anything to my reproductive organs because I wanted to have a child one day. I see pregnancy as a process and it doesn’t define who I am.’ He called the desire to have a child as ‘a human need,’ not an intrinsically male or female function. He and his wife searched far and wide for a doctor who would help Mr Beatie through his pregnancy. They were turned away by eight different doctors before finding one who would take their case. Dr Kimberly James told Oprah in 2008 that the baby was healthy, despite the unique fact that Mr Beatie had been taking testosterone supplements for years. A family affair: Chaz (right) said his mother Cher finally accepted that he was a man . She said: ‘This is what I consider a normal pregnancy.’ A genetic woman who identifies as a man usually receives methyltestosterone injections every two weeks to suppress menses and bring on male secondary sex characteristics, like facial hair and a deeper voice, according to ACOG. Doctors urge these patients still be screened for breast and cervical cancer unless they have been removed. In male-to-female cases, patients receive oestrogen therapy, and as a result, they lose body hair, redistribute body fat, and reduced testicular volume. The patient should be screened for both breast and prostate cancers. OB/GYNs are urged to provide comprehensive medical care to transsexual patients as well. One celebrity who has publicly undergone gender reassignment is Chaz Bono, who started his transformation in 2009. While he was public about having his breasts removed, he told Time last May he wouldn’t divulge whether or not he had ‘bottom surgery,’ and adding ‘I like to keep my privates private.’ But the 42-year-old son of Cher and Sonny Bono said in the upcoming January 19 issue of Rolling Stone that he’s 'saving up to buy a penis', making him one of the many men who would need to visit a gynecologist. He says he’s leaning towards a metoidioplasty – a procedure that enhances the clitoris to make it function more like a penis. He says the procedure is ‘like a car' as there are many makes and models. Another reason to look into it? ‘It’s not that big a deal to sit down, but some of the toilet seats in men’s rooms are disgusting.’","American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists published paper urging OB/GYNs to be more transgender friendly .

Leaks from within Microsoft have revealed a suite of hi-tech new features for Microsoft's Windows Phone - including new software that will let the phones share apps with Windows PCs. A video, of Windows Phone chief Joe Belfiore, and supposedly for consumption by Microsoft's partner Nokia, lists a variety of hi-tech features due in a forthcoming update to Windows Phone software. The key feature is that apps can be shared . more easily with Windows PCs, in the same way as . software is shared across Apple's iPhone and iPad. Nokia's Lumia 900: A leaked video shows off hi-tech new features coming to Windows Phones, including the ability to share apps with Windows . Windows Phone will use much of the same software as Microsoft's upcoming tablet-friendly Windows 8, making it easier for developers to create applications that work on both. Microsoft hopes to have 100,000 apps available at launch. The video was seen by website PocketNow, but other tech insiders who have seen Windows Phone 8 have confirmed several details. Analysts iSuppli have predicted that Microsoft's Windows Phone will overtake Apple's iPhone by 2015. Nokia, which has partnered with Microsoft to produce smartphones running Windows Phone, has sold a million handsets since launch, beating analyst expectations. The new software, codenamed Apollo, should appear in new Nokia handsets, although there is no confirmed release date. The devices will also offer SkyDrive - a remote-storage function which allows users to store files such as digital music online, then access them from any device. It could mean that Windows users will be able to access their entire music collection instantly without having to sync their devices with a PC. The update to Windows Phone will add compatibility for a range of new screen sizes, plus a 'digital wallet' function that will let users tap phones against shop counters to pay for shopping . IHS iSuppli's projection shows Android remaining in the lead, but Windows Phone rising to a narrow lead over iOS by 2015 . The update will also add support for new screen resolutions and will add an NFC (near field communication) chip for contactless payments in shops. Microsoft are describing this as 'the wallet experience'. So far, Windows Phone has remained niche, despite fan and reviewer enthusiasm for the operating system. Last year, Windows Phone accounted for just two per cent of the smartphone market. But by 2015, that figure will be 16.7 per cent, says iSuppli - putting the handsets into second place in the worldwide smartphone race, behind Google's Android, but ahead of Apple's iOS.","Phones will share code with Windows 8 computers .

"By . Emily Allen . Last updated at 7:59 PM on 9th February 2012 . The former wife of Sir Paul McCartney never authorised former Mirror editor Piers Morgan, or anybody else, to listen to her voicemails, she told the inquiry into press standards today. Chat show host Morgan has previously told the inquiry he listened to a voicemail message left to Mills by Sir Paul, but refused to say when or where he heard it because he wanted to protect a 'source' - but did not suggest it had been Ms Mills. Today Ms Mills said she had never authorised Morgan, or anybody, to access or listen to her voicemails, and neither had she ever played a recording to the former editor. Heather Mills speaking at the Leveson Inquiry where she said she had never authorised Morgan, or anybody, to access or listen to her voicemails . 'I couldn't quite believe that he would even try to insinuate, a man that has written nothing but awful things about me for years, would relish in telling the court if I had played a voicemail message to him,' she said. Ms Mills told the inquiry . that in early 2001 she and Sir Paul had argued about a trip she was . planning to Gujurat, and while she stayed with a friend in Middlesex he . left a series of messages on her voicemail. She said: 'In . the morning, when I woke up, there were many messages, but they were . all saved messages which I did not quite understand, because normally . they wouldn't be but I didn't think too much of it. 'I thought I must have pressed a wrong button. 'There were about 25 messages all asking for forgiveness of what had happened. 'One of them said, 'please forgive me' and sang a little ditty of one of his songs on the voicemail. 'So that afternoon I went back and all was forgiven.' She told the hearing she had never recorded the messages and deleted them straight away. Piers Morgan told the inquiry in December (pictured) he would not disclose a source who played him a tape of a message that Sir Paul left Mills . But she said she was then called by a former Trinity Mirror employee - who the inquiry heard was not a Daily Mirror journalist, nor anybody working under the supervision of Morgan - saying they had heard a recording of the message. 'I said, 'there's no way that you could know that unless you have been listening to my messages',' she told the inquiry. 'And he laughed.' She said she threatened to take action if the story was published, and it wasn't. But in 2006, in a piece in the Daily Mail, Morgan referred to having listened to the message. Giving evidence in December, Morgan told the inquiry he would not disclose a source who played him a tape of a message that Sir Paul left Mills. Ms Mills said she was told by detectives from Operation Weeting that they had evidence that her voicemails had been hacked . He said: 'I am not going to discuss where I heard it or who played it to me. 'I don't think it's right. In fact the inquiry has already stated to me you don't expect me to identify sources.' Lord Justice Leveson told him the only person who would be able to lawfully listen to the message was Mills or somebody authorised on her behalf. He told Morgan: 'I am perfectly happy to call Lady McCartney to give evidence as to whether she authorised you to listen to her voicemails. 'She may say she did in which case you're not compromising anybody, but if she didn't then we can proceed on the premise that it's somebody else, can't we.' Asked by counsel for the inquiry Robert Jay QC: 'Did you authorise Mr Morgan to access your voicemail?', she replied 'never'. He asked: 'Did you authorise Mr Morgan to listen to your voicemail?' 'Never ever,' she answered. Ms Mills said that before 1999 press coverage of her had been positive . Mr Jay also asked: 'Have you ever played to Mr Morgan or authorised him to listen to a recording of this or any other voicemail left on your messaging system?', she replied 'Never, never'. And asked if she had ever done this to anybody, she answered: 'No'. Ms Mills said she was told by detectives from Operation Weeting that they had evidence that her voicemails had been hacked. She then showed the court a home video which she had compiled of her interactions with paparazzi photographers. A . man was captured trying to look through a fence surrounding her home . saying: 'Someone should just bring a hand-drill down and put a hole . though.' One subtitle in the video read: 'Hunting Heather becomes a national sport.' She told the inquiry she had 64 hours of footage of alleged harassment. Ms Mills said that before 1999 press coverage of her had been positive but it became negative when she met Sir Paul. She said: 'The second I met my ex-husband I became a one-legged bitch, and cow, and every awful word you could think of.' Ms . Mills told the inquiry that no-win-no-fee agreements needed to ensure . that newspapers would pick up entire costs of cases brought by people . who have 'absolutely no money'. 'There are hundreds and hundreds of people out there who have been through horrific situations with papers making up stories and they have no recourse.' She said the PCC should be a public body sat on by 'respected individual members of the public' for a year, meaning they could not be bribed, blackmailed, or threatened into making decisions. Paul McCartney and his former wife Ms Mills in 2007. She said Sir Paul had left a series of 25 messages on her phone after a row . Also giving evidence, the News of the World's former head of news told the inquiry he was told to deliberately mislead the McCanns' spokesman about the newspaper's plans to publish Kate McCann's diary. Ian Edmondson said former editor Colin Myler told him to have a 'woolly' conversation with Clarence Mitchell about plans to publish Mrs McCann's diary so he did not know what the paper was planning. Mrs McCann said she felt 'violated' when the private journal appeared in the newspaper on September 14 2008. Mr Myler has said he would never have published it if he had realised she was not aware of the paper's plans, and claimed Mr Edmondson told him he had cleared the story with Mr Mitchell. But Mr Edmondson said he was deliberately unclear in his conversation with Mr Mitchell, on the express instructions of Mr Myler. '(Mr Myler) decided to ask me to make a call to Mr Mitchell, not make it clear what we had, telling him in general terms, basically make it woolly. 'He was frightened that if Clarence knew what we had, he might take action.' He also told the inquiry there was a culture of bullying at the News of the World, of which Mr Myler was a part. Mr Mitchell said today he felt vindicated by the evidence. 'I have always said the News of the World actively sought to deceive me over the publication of Kate's diary. 'But to hear that it was apparently done at the editor's direct behest was particularly shocking, if not surprising. Clearly, Mr Myler now has some serious questions to answer. 'The distress this episode caused Kate, Gerry and myself was immense. I am glad we are getting to the truth at last.'",Morgan said he listened to a voicemail left to Mills by Sir Paul but refused to say where or when he heard it .
"By . Nick Pisa On Giglio Island . Last updated at 3:30 PM on 22nd January 2012 . Hundreds of tragedy tourists - armed with picnics and cameras - have arrived on the tiny island of Giglio as rescue workers halted their search of the wrecked super liner Costa Concordia once again. Ferries from the mainland, which would normally be empty at this time of year, were packed as people craned their necks from the decks to catch a glimpse of the stricken Concordia, where so far 12 bodies have been recovered with another 20 still missing. The disaster day trippers sat on rocks just a short distance from where coastguard, firefighters and navy dive teams were searching the 114,000 ton liner as the hunt resumed, after it had once again been called off as the ship had moved slightly overnight. People have been visiting the island to look at the grounded cruise ship Costa Concordia . Some visitors had travelled for hours to get to the island and came armed with picnic baskets and cameras . Families with young children made their way across the sandy beach to Seagull Point where the ship is resting and took pictures of each other with the Concordia in the background before unpacking picnics and tucking into panini in the warm winter sunshine. Officials said that on Saturday alone more than 1,000 tourists had arrived on the island of Giglio on ferries from the Italian mainland - almost ten times the usual figure for a weekend in the low season. Many even called in at the local information office asking if there was any room to stay while others simply arrived on one ferry took pictures of the scene and then immediately left on the following service - spending little more than an hour on Giglio which is just off the Tuscan coast. Truck driver Stefano Lagorio, 35, arrived with his parents after a four hour 330 mile drive and 50 minute ferry trip, and as he took a swig from a beer bottle he said: 'To be honest I am here out of curiosity. I saw it on the TV and just decided to come down and have a look. The ferry over from the mainland was packed with tourists. 'You could tell they were all day trippers as they had rucksacks and plastic shopping bags with picnics. As we approached on the ferry everyone went up on deck and started taking pictures with cameras and their telephones. It was quite a sight to see. We will have a bite to eat here on the rocks by the ship and then head back to Genoa - I'm back at work tomorrow.' Campsite worker Lino Amato, 49, had driven two hours from Florence with his Irish born wife Sharon Murray, 42, and their two children aged 12 and six years old to look at the stricken ship as coastguard and fire fighter boats bobbed up and down next to it. Giglio Tourist Board has said they are trying to discourage people from visiting the island to 'gawp' at the vessel . A man gets close to the water where he takes a picture of a bench which appears to have come from the ship . Twelve people have been found dead and there are 20 missing from the Costa Concordia which ran aground of the west coast of Italy . Lino, who was snapping pictures with his camera, said: 'When you see it this close it is hard to imagine how a ship that size could end up like that. We live two hours away but decided to come down and show the children. It's history really when you think about it.' While Sharon said: 'We couldn't get on the first ferry as it was full so we had to wait for another one. That one was packed as well. You could see people were there just for the day - they outnumbered the emergency services who were on board. Captain Francesco Schettino who abandoned the ship before his passengers . 'I used to work with Costa years ago so that's what made me come and have a look. When you see it this close it's hard to imagine how people could have died - it's so close to the rocks you could swim to safety.' Truck driver Sandro Baldan, 33, was sitting on rocks looking at the Costa with his partner Ivana Boscolo, 33, and as he munched on a slice of pizza he said: 'I'm only here because my girlfriend wanted to come and have a look. We have come from Turin. It was a six hour drive to the port on the mainland and then we got a ferry over first thing in the morning. 'To be honest it was just something to do as it was a Sunday and we both had the day off - I suppose we are here out of curiosity really. When you see the ship it just doesn't seem real. It's like something from a film set. We had trouble getting on the first ferry so got the next one. 'We will spend a few hours here then head back to Turin - it's a six hour drive and we both need to get back to work on Monday.' Elizabeth Nanni, vice president of Giglio Tourist Board, said: 'I actually find this sort of day tripping quite sad - I know it's a normal reaction, you can see it on the motorway when people slow down to look at an accident but people have died here and others are missing. 'I suppose if there were no deaths it would have been OK but that's what I find quite eerie, that people are coming over to look at the place where people died. It's just morbid curiosity really. We have had lots of calls from people asking if there are hotel rooms on the island. 'People just want to come and stay here so they can look but we have told them to wait a few weeks and come and visit this beautiful island when this is all over. I really don't agree with it. It's inappropriate that people are coming over just to gawp. 'At this time of year, it's low season, so we would get maybe get two hundred people over a weekend coming over for a day - that's if the weather is nice but the ferry people have told me more than 1,000 people came over just on Saturday and hundreds have been arriving today.' Libero Schiaffino, who works in the ticket booth for ferry company Toremar, said : 'I have never seen anything like this. In the winter we wouldn't get as many tourists as this coming over for the day. The weekend before the accident we had 131 people visiting now it's ten times that. Rescue workers have been forced to abandon the latest rescue search because of difficult conditions . Some tourists have even asked to hire boats so they can get closer to the wreckage but the area is restricted to rescue workers only . 'People have even been asking me where they can hire a boat so they can get closer to the ship but the area is a crime scene and it is closed off to everyone apart from the emergency services. One couple came over from the mainland on the 2.30pm ferry and then bought a ticket for the same ferry back. 'When you think it takes 50 minutes to cross the water and it leaves at 4pm they were here for less than an hour.' Meanwhile it has also emerged that the island's council want the rock which broke off the reef and embedded itself in the hull of the Concordia tearing a 70m gash to be removed and remain as a permanent memorial to the dead. The huge boulder broke off from a reef off the south east coast of the island known as Le Scole and has amazed coastguards who say it is the first time they have known of a rock breaking off and remaining in the hull of a ship. The tiny Tuscan island is usually quiet this time of year with only a handful of tourists visiting during the winter months but there has been an influx of visitors because of the incident . Mario Pellegrini said: 'That rock has become a symbol of this tragedy. It was one of the first things that struck us when we saw the ship in daylight - I've never known of a ship striking a rock and having a piece left embedded inside it. 'The idea would be that once this is all over we will remove the rock and place it somewhere as a memorial. It will be a reminder of what happened that night and we will put the names of all the victims on it.' Officials said that eight out of the 12 bodies recovered so far have been identified, while three men and a woman, are still unidentified. Rescue chief Franco Gabrielli also said some of the missing may not have been properly registered. Italian media have speculated that some of the missing crew from South America and Asia may have been employed without proper contracts and working illegally and therefore not registered.","Ferries from the mainland ten times fuller than they would normally be at this time of year .

A 'wolfman' who has been living wild in a forest for the past five years, surviving on rabbits, plants and berries, is at the centre of a police hunt. Wayne Morgan, 37, has been using survival skills honed in the army as he sleeps rough - but police fear he could freeze to death in the cold weather. The elusive man, who has a thick beard, disappeared into the forest in Pantyffynon Woods, near Ammanford, Carmarthenshire, in 2007. He is occasionally spotted by ramblers through the trees - but has not been seen for over a year. Locals call him 'The Wolfman' and have blamed him for a series of thefts of milk from their doorsteps. Police have previously tried to track down Mr Morgan - described as a real-life . Rambo - after it emerged he had . turned to petty crime to survive. Sniffer dogs and a helicopter with heat-seeking equipment were brought in to trace him, but police believe he knows the woodland . so well he was able to lie low. They found abandoned . hideouts and evidence that he had lit fires to cook meals. Now, after the record low temperatures and a lack of sightings police say they are 'very concerned' for his safety. Home: Wayne Morgan has been hiding in Pantyffynon Woods, near Ammanford, Carmarthenshire, since 2007. Ramblers occasionally catch a glimpse of him . Sergeant Theresa Ross, of Dyfed Powys Police, . said: 'We have been aware of a man known locally as Wolfman living in woods for a number of years. 'Anyone walking in the wooded area . who may have seen this man should get in contact with us to let us know . when any sightings took place.' 'He is not known to claim benefits of be registered with any . agency so he may be hungry and on the look-out for food. 'If you are suspicious that any food items are missing from your stores then please contact us.' Mr Morgan is thought to get some of his meals from supermarket bins as well as scavenging anything he can find from the woodland. Local councillor Hugh Evans said: 'He . is a bit of a Rambo type and pretty tough to have survived the bitterly . cold winter living out in the open. 'The area where he is living is thickly-wooded and forested - the sort of area where it is easy to disappear.'

Both victims had been shot in the head and Mr Payne had his throat cut, according to Timesnews.net. The victims had complained to police that Jenelle Potter, 30, was harassing them after they deleted her as a friend on the social networking site, according to Sheriff Mike Reece. The sheriff said: 'It's a senseless thing.' Miss Hayworth and Mr Payne had been living with his father, Billy Payne . Sr who was the last person to see them alive. He told detectives he . saw Miss Hayworth get up to feed the baby before he left for work at 5.30 am on January 31. The couple's bodies were discovered five hours later when a former neighbour . stopped by to pick up mail the family had collected for him. Shot dead: Billy Payne Jr (right) and his girlfriend Billie Jean Hayworth (left) were allegedly killed after defriending someone on Facebook Tennessee.

Marvin Potter's friend Curd, who is believed to be Mr Payne's second cousin, is believed . to have romantic feelings for Miss Potter, according to the sheriff. Police said there have been other cases where Miss Potter believed that she had been slighted by someone. Johnson County Sheriff Mike Reece told The Tomahawk newspaper his department and the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation interviewed more than 150 individuals during a week-long investigation. It culminated with Curd being taken in for questioning on Monday night, after which he was arrested. And officers, armed with arrest and search warrants, raided Potter's home at 3.30am on Tuesday morning. He said: 'They had been people of interest from the beginning.' The pair will appear in court on March 7. Potter and Curd were arraigned yesterday. Potter asked for time to hire an attorney while Curd was assigned a public defender who did not immediately return a phone message. Assistant District Attorney General Matthew Roark said Curd's initial bond was raised to $1.5million while Roark agreed to put off a bond hearing for Potter until next week, when he is expected to have an attorney.

"By . Lauren Paxman . Last updated at 10:38 AM on 8th February 2012 . A woman who had to have 20 operations to rebuild her face after being thrown from a horse is suing the keeper for huge damages. Kara Goldsmith, 39, alleges she was left in persistent pain and had to give up her job after the animal trampled on her face in March 2008. In a High Court action which could have serious implications for hundreds of riding centres nationwide, the mother-of-two claims that equestrians should be granted better legal protection when riding animals that are not their own. The case against businessman Bradley . Patchcott has already been thrown out by Judge Christopher Walton, . sitting at Newcastle County Court. Test case: The appeal could have huge implications for riding centres nationwide . But Mrs Goldsmith appealed the . decision and today her barrister argued that the earlier judgment was . unfair and left his client – and every horse rider in England and Wales, . with no legal protection if their mount unexpectedly behaved 'nastily . or viciously'. Addressing three High Court judges, . Richard Stead described how Mrs Goldsmith had taken nine-year-old . gelding Red for a ‘test ride’ at Stanley, in Country Durham. The pair had trotted and cantered for approximately 20 minutes without any problem. But on the way back to the stable, Red ‘suddenly and without warning reared up full height on his hind legs’. 'He then bucked violently several . times. Mrs Goldsmith was thrown from the horse and was then struck in . the face by the horse’s hoof,’ Mr Stead said. 'Her face was stamped upon by the . horse. She has undergone 20 operations to try and rebuild her face and a . remarkably good job has been done, but she still suffers persistent . pain and is permanently on pain killers.' Mrs Goldsmith, who lives with her . husband Ronald and children, aged ten and six, in Hallgarth, Consett, County . Durham, had been trying Red out with the intention of buying him. The court was told that the horse’s . previous owner was getting rid of him after a fall which caused her to . 'lose her confidence'. Her barrister said that Mr Patchcott . knew this – and should have warned her Red, who was being given away for . free, was tricky to control before she took the animal for a ride. Mr Stead argued that she should have . won the original case under the Animals Act, which makes keepers of . animals 'strictly liable' if they are aware they have particular . 'characteristics', not normally found in their species, which create a . risk of serious injury. 'The judge wrongly concluded that Mrs . Goldsmith voluntarily assumed the risk of injury when in fact the only . evidence was that the horse bucked in a violent manner so as to throw . her from the horse,' he said. 'Such behaviour could not have been . expected from the horse and Mrs Goldsmith would not have ridden the . horse if she had been aware of the risk. 'The judge wrongly concluded she . voluntarily assumed the risk of injury caused by violent bucking simply . by virtue of the fact that she knew that horses could buck when spooked . and cause the rider to fall off.' Mrs Goldsmith, an experienced rider, is suing for damages and loss of earnings. Benjamin Browne QC, defending former . pharmaceutical company boss Mr Patchcott, said: 'Neither party contended . that the horse had a known propensity to buck violently. 'Mrs Goldsmith consented to the risk . that the horse could buck. It is obvious that on occasions when a horse . bucks it will throw its rider. 'The distinction Mrs Goldsmith seeks . to draw is between general knowledge that a horse may buck and throw its . rider, and knowledge that a horse may buck so violently that even an . experienced rider cannot stay in the saddle. 'It is suggested that she consented . to the former but not the latter. Given that the behaviour of horses is . unpredictable it is submitted that the County Court judge’s approach was . correct. 'Any other approach would produce a wholly unreasonable test', he added. 'The court may need to consider how . many bucks may be anticipated in a normal horse and how high such bucks . may be - six inches off the ground? seven inches? eight inches? 'Why should strict liability apply to a person who voluntarily gets on the back of a horse? 'If it does, you are going to get innocent owners penalised who know nothing of any vicious propensity in their animals. 'It is submitted that this was a . nasty, vicious horse and it bucked and reared much more than Mrs . Goldsmith could have expected, (but) any horse can buck or rear and you . simply don’t know as a rider,' Mr Browne concluded. Recognising the importance of the . case, Lords Justice Longmore, Rimer and Jackson have now reserved their . decision until an unspecified later date.","Kara Goldsmith had her case against the horse’s .

"By . Paul Sims . Last updated at 1:23 AM on 23rd December 2011 . As Europe’s largest military base, it is home to more than 12,000 Army personnel and their families. So it must have come as a surprise to the soldiers of Catterick Garrison when they discovered that the Military Wives charity single was nowhere to be seen in their local Tesco. Not least because the whole idea for the record came from a member of the garrison’s own Wags choir of servicemen’s wives and girlfriends. The Military Wives on Oxford Street on Tuesday. Their charity single 'Wherever You Are' is currently outselling the rest of the top 20 combined . But surprise turned to anger when they were told by Tesco that its store in the North Yorkshire Army base was ‘too small’ to stock the song, Wherever You Are – even though it was big enough for Little Mix’s X Factor song, Cannonball. The ban on the Military Wives single led to heartfelt protests from a battalion of disappointed locals. And last night Tesco was beating a hasty retreat on its decision. Retired headmistress Glennis Walton, from nearby Scotton, tried to buy the single – which is outselling the rest of the Top 20 combined and is expected to be the Christmas number one – on Wednesday. ‘They told me the store isn’t big enough,’ she said. ‘Well, it’s big enough to take the money from the military personnel. ‘I’ve never been 'incandescent of Scotton' before, but I feel very strongly about this.’ Mrs Walton was forced to buy the single online instead. Another shopper, Jennie Pinkney, of nearby Richmond, was equally appalled when she and her husband tried to buy the single on Monday. ‘He was looking for the disc and he caught up with me and said, 'You’ll not believe it – they don’t have the single',’ she said. The Tesco in Catterick claims it is 'too small' to stock the charity single . ‘I went up to the help desk and they told me the store was too small to stock the Military Wives single. I was furious about it. This is a Tesco store that is in the heart of the biggest military base in Western Europe. ‘They had the X Factor girls’ single. I don’t have anything against them, good luck to them, but military servicemen’s wives work at this Tesco, and military personnel use the store. 'Given the price of the single, it’s the kind of thing children would want to buy for their parents who are serving in the forces. Catterick Garrison is the largest British Army garrison in the world with a population of around 12,000, plus a large temporary population of soldiers. It is said to be the largest army base in Europe. It is not a single fenced base, but several separate barracks around which a town has developed. The Garrison gained its first large supermarket, a Tesco, in 2000 along with a retail park including a McDonald's. ‘We have a history of RAF service in our family so I was appalled they did not stock the single. The girls on the help desk said they would pass my concerns higher up the chain after my complaint.’ Local businessman Alasdair MacConachie, who chairs the garrison’s independent advisory panel, said: ‘It’s a great shame they have not got behind this. ‘They should be doing what they can to support it.' In the face of the onslaught, Tesco was last night shipping copies of the single to the garrison. A spokesman said the supermarket chain’s customers tended to purchase and download singles online, so it did not generally stock them in its stores. But he added: ‘This is a special charity project we are pleased to be supporting. The single is available in 205 of our stores and on December 26 it will be available in 458.’ The Military Wives were formed by choirmaster Gareth Malone for BBC2 programme The Choir. He was given the idea by a member of Catterick Garrison Wags Choir. The single is raising money for the Royal British Legion and the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen And Families Association. The Treasury said this week that it has agreed to give a sum equivalent to the VAT on sales of the single to the appeal.","Store at Catterick Garrison says it is 'too small' to sell the charity CD .

"Leading human rights lawyer to review judgement on the peers who were given lengthy bans from Parliament . by ANDREW PIERCE . Last updated at 12:33 PM on 21st November 2011 . Lady Uddin: She claimed more than £100,000 between 2005 and 2010 and was apparently reduced to tears by questioning . Three Asian peers given lengthy bans from Parliament after wrongly claiming almost £200,000 in expenses are at the centre of an extraordinary legal battle over whether they were targeted because of their race. The sanctions against Lady Uddin, Lord Paul, and Lord Bhatia were the most draconian against misbehaving peers in 300 years. But now Labour peer Lord Ali has hired leading human rights lawyer Imran Khan to review the damning judgment on the peers by the Lords Privileges and Conduct Committee. At least one of the three – Lord Paul – admitted he had ‘grave reservations’ about the disciplinary process used to punish him. Asked if he thought he had been the victim of racism, he said last night: ‘I am very unhappy with the way I was treated but am not willing to comment any further.’ The suspensions, ordered last October, were the longest for the Upper House since the 17th century. They were prompted by a series of revelations made by peers at the time of the MPs’ expenses scandal and led to a string of internal disciplinary probes. Lord Ali, who created Channel 4’s Big Breakfast, was made a peer by Tony Blair in 1998 at the age of 34. He said: ‘Something is not right about the way these three peers were treated. There were at least 12 members of the House of Lords who were accused of abusing their second home allowances. Yet only these three were singled out to be disciplined. Look at them. ‘All three are Asian. It does not look right. This process was flawed. At one point, when Lady Uddin was before the sub-committee she was reduced to tears by the questioning. ‘She excused herself, and went to the lavatory, but within three minutes they were bashing on the door demanding she come out.’ Suspended: Lord Bhatia, left and Lord Paul, right, were given lengthy bans from Parliament for wrongly claiming tens of thousands of pounds in expenses . The Labour peer Lord Clarke of Hampstead also breached the rules governing the second homes allowance. But after he repaid £9,190 he was ordered to apologise in the Lords chamber and was not suspended. Lord Ali, a multi-millionaire who gave up investment banking to set up Planet 24 broadcasting company in the 1990s with Bob Geldof, said: ‘I felt I had no choice but to ask Imran Khan to conduct an independent review.’ Lord Ali will pay Mr Khan’s fees but – whatever his conclusions – the House of Lords will not be bound to react to them. Members of the sub-committee of the Conduct committee included Lord Irvine, a former Labour Lord Chancellor, Lady Eliza Manningham-Buller, the former head of MI5, and Lord Dholakia who for 25 years was head of the Commission for Racial Equality. Lady Uddin claimed expenses by stating that her main residence was a small flat in Maidstone, Kent, pictured above . The intervention of Lord Ali has appalled many of his colleagues. Lord Strathclyde, the Leader of the Lords, said in a letter to Lord Ali: ‘I regret that you have felt it necessary to pursue this route particularly in the light of assurances from Lady Manningham-Buller and Lord Dholakia. ‘In particular, I reject any suggestion that race played a role in the deliberations of the relevant committees and House officials.’ Tanzanian-born Lord Dholakia, a former president of the Lib Dems, said: ‘I have spent almost 30 years in the race relations industry. It is unthinkable I would be involved in anything that smacks of racism.’ Lady Uddin's actual family home (pictured) in Wapping, east London . Lord Taylor and Lord Hanningfield, who were Tory peers, were jailed earlier this year for 12 months and nine months respectively for fiddling their second home allowances after a police investigation. They are suspended from the House until May. Lady Uddin claimed more than £100,000 between 2005 and 2010 by stating that her main residence was a small flat in Maidstone, Kent, rather than her family home in East London. She was suspended for 18 months and ordered to repay £125,000 in second home allowances. Lord Bhatia had claimed £27,446 on the basis that his main home was a small flat occupied by his brother in Reigate, Surrey, even though he and his wife were listed on the electoral roll at their long-standing address in Hampton, South-West London. He was sidelined for eight months, has repaid more than £27,000 and resumed his seat. Lord Paul, one of Britain’s richest men, lived in London but designated a one-bedroom flat in an Oxfordshire hotel that he owned as his main home. He was suspended for four months and has returned £41,982. All three also claimed travel expenses. Lady Uddin and Lord Bhatia were found by the conduct committee to have acted ‘not in good faith’ by incorrectly declaring their main homes to claim overnight allowances. An initial investigation reached the same conclusion about Lord Paul. However, on appeal the committee accepted that although ‘utterly unreasonable’ and negligent, he had not been dishonest. Neither Lord Bhatia or Lady Uddin were willing to comment.",Leading human rights lawyer to review judgement on the peers who were given lengthy bans from Parliament .

A photograph of a handcuffed teenage boy found in the possessions of an accomplice of the Candy Man has prompted concerns there is a 29th young victim, after it was found the boy does not match any records of known victims. Dean Corll, nicknamed the 'Candy Man' because he gave young boys sweets from his family's business, and two . other men, terrorised the Houston, Texas area between 1970 to 1973 . abducting raping, torturing and murdering at least 28 young males. Now a filmmaker has found evidence that there may be a 29th victim after he discovered a grainy polaroid of a . terrified young boy bent over on the ground, with handcuffs on and near a toolbox . which matches crime scene photos from inside Corll's home. Grim discovery: A filmmaker has found evidence that there may be a 29th victim after he discovered a grainy polariod of a young boy bent over on the ground, with handcuffs on and near a toolbox which matches crime scene photos from inside Dean Corrl's home . The photo was found in the boxed-up possessions of Elmer Wayne Henley (left), who assisted 'Candy Man' killer Dean Corll (right)  between 1970 to 1973 in . abducting raping, torturing and murdering at least 28 young males . Josh Vargas discovered the aged photo in the belongings of Corll's accomplice Elmer Wayne Henley. Henley helped Corll in the depraved killings until he shot him after a row. He gained access to the Henley's belongings after he interviewed his mother to gain information for a film he was making about the killings. She directed him to a school bus in an . overgrown field where she had boxed up all her son's possessions after . he confessed and the boxes had not been touched for decades. 'We were the first person who went through that stuff for forty years,' Mr Vargas told KTRK. In a mouldy box at the back of the bus, the filmmaker found a sealed photo envelope. 'While rummaging through those pictures, this Polaroid falls out,' Vargas told ABC affiliate KTRK. 'I take a look at it and, right off the . bat, having studied the case and the crime scene photos and everything, I . see Dean’s toolbox, and I see his implements in that tool box, and I . see this kid right here with handcuffs on his arms.' When Mr Vargas took the photo to . Henley in prison, he said he could not recall the victim but said there . were other young boys who had still not been identified. Mr Vargas gave the photograph to the Harris County Medical Examiner’s . Office, which reviewed the photograph and determined it was not of any . of the known victims. Henley's mother boxed up all her son's possessions after . he confessed and the boxes had not been touched for decades . The filmmaker is now appealing for anyone with any information about the identity of the young boy in the photograph to come forward.

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 4:12 PM on 7th February 2012 . Behind bars: 'The She-Devil' Margaret Gilheaney who has been jailed for ten years following the attacks . A mother-of-two nicknamed 'The She-Devil' after being involved in savage unprovoked attacks on two men with her feral teenage children has been jailed for 10 years. Margaret Gilheaney, 36, was arrested after the first victim, Jordan Daley, was battered with a bottle by her son Joseph, 19, in their 'dirty and smelly' £30,000 terraced property in Accrington, Lancashire. He needed 51 stitches and was scarred for life following the attack which happened as he celebrated his 18th birthday. The mother-of-two was then also involved as a father-of-three was stabbed 14 times. Matthew Howard, 27, thought he was going to die after being attacked by Margaret and her daughter Isabel, 18. He was dragged out into the alleyway and abandoned. He suffered a collapsed lung, nerve damage and was left disabled. While he was in hospital he missed the birth of his youngest child three days later when he was in hospital. Both attacks were meted out for pleasure by the teenage children at separate rowdy parties. After Margaret and her children were jailed one neighbour said: 'People called her the She-Devil . because of all the problems at her house and none of us are surprised . her brood turned out to be little horrors too.' Her daughter Isabel was jailed for six years while her son Joseph was given eight years. Sarah Booth, prosecuting, told Burnley Crown Court that as Mr Daley, 18, tried to leave the party in August 2010, at the grim family home but Gilheaney and his friends followed him outside and attacked him. The victim was repeatedly hit and kicked while he lay on the ground screaming for help. Miss Booth said: 'He believed he was knocked unconscious and a witness described everyone piling on top of the victim and the defendant. 'Another onlooker told how Mr Daley ended up with a hole in his lip, his nose split in half and with deep cuts all over his face and body. Jailed: Joseph and Isabel, both 19, who carried out the attacks on Jordan Daley and Matthew Howard in Accrington, Lancashire . 'Mr Daley and his friends finally got away, were chased as they left and he went to hospital, where he had 26 stitches to his face and 25 in his arms.' The court heard police later made several arrests. Then last February, while Gilheaney was on bail, Mr Howard was attacked as he tried to leave the family's 'dirty and smelly' home. Miss Booth said Maughan locked the door, became aggressive and clenched his fist as if he was going to punch him. The victim took a 'pre-emptive' strike before a brawl broke out. The prosecutor added: 'Mr Howard felt what he thought were punches to his back, felt warm and weak and turned to see Margaret and Isabel Gilheaney with a machete type knife. 'He collapsed on the floor on his back, felt numb all over and couldn’t move his leg. Isabel Gilheaney passed the knife to her partner who continued the attack. Grim: The 'dirty and smelly' mid-terrace property, worth £40,000, where Margaret Gilheaney lived with her children . 'Maughan wielded the weapon towards the victim’s face, Mr Howard put up his arms to protect himself and was gashed. She-Devil: Roseanne Barr stars in the 1989 film . 'The victim thought he was going to die and drifted in and out of consciousness. He pleaded with the defendant to stop, telling his assailants he had three children. 'Maughan tried unsuccessfully to pull him up by his neck and the three defendants then dragged him into the back yard, down a step and left him in the back street. He believed he was going to die there alone in the alley.' Margaret later called an ambulance but falsely claimed she had just come across Mr Howard in the street. Mr Howard said of his attackers : 'I feel the public will not be safe if they are released.' The court heard when questioned by police, Margaret Gilheaney claimed self defence and her children denied any involvement. However, she admitted violent disorder and wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm. Isabel, who lives with her mother and has racked up 20 previous convictions, admitted wounding with intent. Joseph, who has 35 previous . convictions, admitted wounding with intent and affray. He also admitted . chasing two neighbours down the street with a two-and-a-half foot . machete in a separate incident. Isabel’s boyfriend Martin Maughan, . 19, from Accrington, was also jailed for three years four months for . wounding while convicted robber David Cammack, 28, who is already . serving four years jail for a shop raid, was given another 12 months for . violent disorder. Passing sentence Judge Jonathan Gibson said Joseph should be regarded as a 'dangerous offender.'

"By . Chris Brooke . Last updated at 1:26 AM on 10th February 2012 . Victoria Fraenzel had no idea that Upton was a married father-of-one . To his clients, he was a happily married accountant who they trusted to look after their affairs. But in reality, Darren Upton was stealing hundreds of thousands of pounds from them so he could live a luxury lifestyle and keep a glamorous mistress. The 40-year-old had begun a relationship with blonde model Victoria Fraenzel, 36, after using an internet dating website and pretending to be single. He bought her sexy lingerie, set her up in an £800 a month flat, gave her spending money and provided her with designer clothes and Mulberry handbags. Upton also paid for Bentley and Maserati cars with personalised number plates for himself and his wife, splashed out on a £10,000 box at Leeds United football club and even spent £3,000 on a model railway. Miss Fraenzel had no idea her lover was married with an 18-month-old child until she rang his office and was put in touch with his wife Tina, Leeds Crown Court was told. In total the accountant left 33 clients and the taxman with losses of more than half a million pounds. Yesterday Upton was jailed for six years after admitting 15 fraud offences between January 2010 and June last year. He asked for 23 similar offences to be taken into consideration. Upton, who had previously been investigated and forced to pay compensation for an unauthorised investment scheme, had continued to commit offences when he was on bail. Passing sentence, Judge Sally Cahill, QC, said the crimes were committed for ‘pure selfish greed’. She told him: ‘You were thoroughly dishonest and motivated by greed. This was a gross breach of trust, it was planned from the offset and fraudulent from the offset. 'I consider this to be professional offending at a high level.’ Prosecuting, Nick Worsley said the defendant was director of Upton and Co Accountants in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, and his wife worked as the company secretary. The firm had around 800 clients, mainly small information technology companies.Instead of paying his clients’ Corporation Tax to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, Upton used their cash and diverted it into his own account for personal use. The total value of his fraud was £532,000. His clients even ended up having to pay penalties for unpaid tax when his crimes were exposed.Upton, of Woodlesford, Leeds, made excuses when questions arose and eventually staff at his firm reported him to the police. Darren Upton met make-up artist and part time model Victoria Fraenzel on a dating website . Family man: The home in Leeds where Upton lives with his wife Tina and their 18-month-old child . Mr Worsley said many of the clients he deceived felt totally betrayed as they regarded him as a friend, while one even had Upton as a guest at his wedding. Other victims said their businesses had been left close to collapse and they had suffered ill health. One said: ‘I am absolutely devastated I have been left in this position and it has had a massive effect on my business.’ He said he could no longer take on staff because of Upton’s betrayal. The main beneficiary of Upton’s greed and spending was Miss Fraenzel, a  make-up artist and part-time model. After meeting her in October 2010, Upton paid the deposit and rent on a flat in Salford for her to use, the court heard. He began paying for a Mercedes sports car for her and gave her a living allowance. He bought her clothes from Harvey Nichols, Mulberry handbags and Ann Summers lingerie. The court heard they enjoyed nights out at Hilton hotels and she considered herself to be his girlfriend until she discovered he was married. James Littlehayles, defending, claimed Upton made a legitimate annual profit of £250,000, but began offending because he was forced to repay £840,000 to the Financial Services Authority in monthly instalments of £10,000 in connection with the earlier unauthorised investment scheme, which had not led to criminal charges. Luxury: Upton used £14,500 to refinance a Bentley Continental, pictured, which was in breach of a court order issued when he was arrested (library picture) ‘He was not prepared to cut back on . his lifestyle. Rather than give up his box at Leeds United and the . vehicles which he had previously legitimately funded, he then starts to . misappropriate clients’ funds,’ he said. After the case, Detective Sergeant Gary Ferris said he was delighted his victims had seen justice served. ‘He [Upton] was incredibly deceitful,’ he said. ‘Not only was he stealing monies from his clients, he was also . blackening their names with the HMRC and continued to carry out his . crimes even when he was on bail.’","Darren Upton diverted clients' tax money into his own bank account .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Last updated at 3:38 PM on 9th February 2012 . Controversial manufacturing behemoth Foxconn has apparently been hacked by a group calling itself Swagg Security, which says it made public passwords and staff log-in credentials that could be used to make fraudulent orders. The shadowy organisation posted a message to Pastebin last night claiming they’d broken through its security measures for ‘the hilarity that ensues when compromising and destroying an infrastructure’. Foxconn is the biggest exporter in China and makes Apple’s iPod and iPad products. However, it has courted bad press recently over the conditions allegedly endured by its workers, some of whom are reported to have attempted committed suicide as a result. Hard grafters: Workers inside a factory of Foxconn, which has reportedly been hacked by Swagg Security. A New York Times investigation looked at the working . conditions . The New York Times claims that in 2009 a Foxconn employee fell or jumped from an apartment building after losing an iPhone prototype. Over the next two years, at least 18 other Foxconn workers were linked to attempted suicides. Critics point to photographs of one factory that has huge nets on its outside walls that appear to be have been erected to prevent workers jumping to their deaths. Swagg Security managed to steal Foxconn staff email log-ins and intranet credentials and posted them online, explaining that they could be used to place fraudulent orders. However, the group states that it didn’t carry out the attack to make a protest at worker conditions.

"By . Rachel Quigley . Last updated at 4:31 PM on 9th February 2012 . The husband of the Michigan mother who was found strangled in her car last month has spoken about the murder, saying he is petrified he will spend the rest of his life in jail for a crime he didn't commit. Bob Bashara, 54, appeared with his daughter Jessie on Good Morning America and revealed what they thought happened to marketing director Jane Bashara, who disappeared from her home on January 24. He said: 'I did nothing wrong. I didn't commit murder. I didn't . pay to have my wife killed. I'm going to see this through to the end. And I'm innocent. 'And all the badgering, and all the bad words, and all . the negativity, I'm going to have to live through.' Scroll down for video . Innocent: Bob Bashara and his daughter Jessie spoke to GMA with both insisting Bob had nothing to do with the Michigan mother's murder . New discovery: Police searched the Grosse Pointe property again on Wednesday and found blood in the garage . Deceit: Though they had been married for 26 years, police said Bob was having an affair with a 50-year-old woman . Speaking out for the first time and clutching her father's hand, Jessie said: 'I just know how my mom felt about him, and the way they looked at each other … all of their disagreements were worked out by talking, communicating. And they were each other's equals. 'There was never any even hint towards violence, or anything like that. It was completely a loving relationship. Without a doubt in my mind, I know that he did not do it. 'There's no way. No fight ever. Just - absolutely not.' Police again searched the Bashara's Grosse Pointe home on Wednesday and found blood in the garage - something they said they missed in their initial extensive search of the property and the surrounding area. Bob Bashara said he finds it 'fishy' that it's the first time they found it despite extensively searching the home two weeks ago. On the day of Jane's memorial service, Joseph Gentz, a man known to the family, turned himself into police and said Bashara pointed a gun to his head and made him kill his wife, something he said he was paid $2,000 for. Confession: Joe Gentz is said to have the IQ of a third grader and told police he was forced at gunpoint to kill Jane . Open marriage?: Bashara has denied having an affair with Rachel Gilette, pictured, and refused to talk about it to GMA . It also emerged that Bashara was having an affair with a woman called Rachel Gillette and was planning on buying a house with her. But he told GMA he had 'no reason' to kill his wife of 26 years and that he loved her very much: 'We had a very good, open relationship. I'm frightened about this. To know that I could spend the rest of my life in jail for a crime I didn't commit is a very scary thing.' Jane Bashara with her daughter Jessie, who said she has no doubt in her mind her dad is innocent . The 54-year-old said he came home to find his wife missing and the lights and TV left on in their home. She was found strangled the next day in her SUV in a Detroit alley. Bruises on her body and broken finger nails proved she 'fought for her life', according to police. Bashara said he last spoke to his wife when she was driving home from work but phone records showed no such phone call took place. The local businessman admitted he and Joe Gentz, 48, had a dispute over a $600 bill and Bashara's attorney believes Gentz may have showed up at his home and demanded money off Jane before getting into a struggle with her. Police said the mother-of-two was murdered in her home and then dumped in her car. Her husband told police Gentz's version of events was absurd and said he does not even own a firearm. He told GMA the allegations are a 'sick assessment' that 'shows how deranged he is'. 'I do believe he's the one that did it. He wanted more money from me. He badgered me. And yes, I do believe he's . capable of it,' Bashara said. It has been reported that Gentz has the IQ of a third grader. He told police he turned himself in . as he did not want to be wholly implicated in the crime but that Bashara . was the mastermind behind it all. Investigators also confirmed they found an 'S&M sex dungeon' in the basement of a bar Bashara owned called the Hard Luck Lounge. Fear: Bashara insists he has no reason to kill his wife of 26 years and is petrified of spending his life behind bars . Earlier this week a Detroit dominatrix named Lady Geanna told WXYZ-TV that Bashara hosted S&M sex parties there. She said: 'Several of my clients or slaves have called me today. Since this has come out I've had like over 20 phone calls. 'They . are all people who have been to his parties and asked if I was involved . with them,' she said on Friday. Some of them were worried there might . have been hidden cameras, things like that.' Sources . confirmed the room was filled with whips, chains and a bed and that .

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 3:57 PM on 9th February 2012 . Trust your doctor? A new survey has found that some doctors fib about a patient's prognosis, with more than half admitting they described someone's prognosis in a way they knew was too rosy. Nearly 20 percent said they hadn't fully disclosed a medical mistake for fear of being sued. And 1 in 10 of those surveyed said they had told a patient something that wasn't true in the past year. Physician fibs? About half of the doctors surveyed said they have been less than honest with a patient to give them hope when faced with a grim diagnosis . But the survey, by Massachusetts researchers and published in this month's Health Affairs, does not explain why, or what wasn't true. Lead researcher Dr Lisa Iezzoni, a . Harvard Medical School professor and director of Massachusetts General . Hospital's Mongan Institute for Health Policy, said: 'I don't think that physicians set out to be dishonest'. She said the untruths could have been to give people hope. But it takes open communication for patients to make fully informed decisions about their health care, as opposed to the 'doctor-knows-best' paternalism of medicine's past, Dr Iezzoni added. The survey offers 'a reason for patients to be vigilant and to be very clear with their physician about how much they do want to know,' she said. Guarded condition: The survey suggests that many doctors fail to admit a medical mistake to avoid an expensive lawsuit . The findings come from a 2009 survey of more than 1,800 physicians nationwide to see if they agree with and follow certain standards of medical professionalism issued in 2002. Among the voluntary standards are that doctors should be open and honest about all aspects of patient care, and promptly disclose any mistakes. A third of those surveyed didn't completely agree that doctors should 'fess up' about mistakes. That's even though a growing number of medical centres are adopting policies that tell doctors to say 'I'm sorry' up front, in part because studies have found patients less likely to sue when that happens. Not revealing a mistake is 'just inexcusable,' said Dr Arthur Caplan, a prominent medical ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania. Beyond decency, 'your care now has to be different because of what happened.' The vast majority of those surveyed agreed that physicians should fully inform patients of the risks, not just the benefits, of treatment options and never tell a patient something that isn't true - even though some acknowledged they hadn't followed that advice at least on rare occasions in the past year. Perhaps least surprising is that doctors give overly positive prognoses. Best policy: The majority of those surveyed agreed doctors should never tell a patient something that isn't true - even though some acknowledged they hadn't followed that advice in the past year . It's hard to deliver bad news, especially when a patient has run out of options, and until recently doctors have had little training in how to do so. But Dr Iezzoni said patients with the worst outlook especially deserve to know, so they can get their affairs in order, and patient studies have found most want to know. What else might doctors not tell? There are shades of gray, said Dr Caplan, the ethicist. For example, he has heard doctors agonize over what to tell parents about a very premature baby's chances, knowing the odds are really bad but also knowing they've seen miracles. Doctors prescribe placebos sometimes, and telling the patient could negate chances of the fake treatment helping, he noted. Sometimes they exaggerate a health finding to shock the patient into shaping up. And sometimes it's a matter of dribbling out a hard truth to give patients a chance to adjust, Dr Caplan said: 'OK, this looks serious but we're going to order some more tests,' when the doctor already knows just how grim things are. Withholding the full story is getting harder, though, Dr Iezzoni said. Not only do more patients Google their conditions so they know what to ask, but some doctors who have embraced electronic medical records allow patients to check their test results.","Study out of Massachusetts reveals some doctors don't disclose medical mistakes out of fear of being sued .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:34 AM on 10th February 2012 . Nearly a third of terror suspects released or transferred from Guantanamo Bay after being classified as an acceptable threat went on to re-engage in insurgent activities, a secret report has revealed. The Bush and Obama administrations moved 600 detainees out of the top-security prison in Cuba because of domestic political pressure - only for 27 per cent to reoffend. The report, by Republicans on a House of Representatives Armed Services subcommittee, provides the GOP perspective on an issue that has divided Washington since the start of the Afghanistan war and the use of the Navy prison for those captured. Persistent challenge: Nearly a third of the 600 terror suspects released or transferred from Guantanamo Bay (above) having been deemed an acceptable risk went on to re-offend (file picture) Failures:  Former U.S. President George W Bush (left) and his successor Barack Obama (right) sought to reduce the prison population in the face of domestic political pressure and a desire to earn goodwill abroad, the report revealed . And it split the White House and Congress last year over how to write rules on handling detainees. The report, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press, comes as the Obama administration officials have acknowledged that they are considering whether to release several Afghan Taliban prisoners from Guantanamo and send them to a third country as an incentive to bring the Taliban to peace talks. The step is certain to create an uproar in Congress, especially among Republicans. The 93-page study is likely to be part of the Republican effort to influence the ongoing debate. In a rare break on a committee that typically is bipartisan on defense issues, Democrats dissented from the report despite efforts to reconcile their differences. Bargaining tool: The report comes as Obama administration officials admit they are considering whether to release several Afghan Taliban prisoners from Guantanamo as part of peace talk negotiations . The report from the Armed Services investigations panel cites testimony before the committee last year that 27 per cent of former detainees 'were confirmed or suspected to have been re-engaged in terrorist or insurgent activities,' up from 25 per cent the previous year. Intelligence officials had indicated that the number would increase. 'The Bush and Obama administrations, reacting to domestic political pressures and a desire to earn goodwill abroad, sought to reduce the Guantanamo population by sending detainees elsewhere,' the report said. 'Both administrations faced the persistent challenge of ensuring that the potential threat posed by each detainee had been aptly assessed before transfer or release, and that the countries that received the detainees had the capacity and willingness to handle them in a way that sufficiently recognized the dangers involved. 'Despite earnest and well-meaning efforts by officials in both administrations, the re-engagement rate suggests failures in one or both aspects of the process,' the report concluded. The report recommended that the Defense Department, CIA and other intelligence agencies report to Congress on the factors that contribute to a former detainee re-engaging in terrorist activities. The committee also is seeking reports on the effectiveness of agreements with other countries. As of January 1, 779 individuals have been held at Guantanamo, 600 have left the installation, eight died there and 171 remain, the report said, citing the Defense Department. The report noted that former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld held the view that the military should not be a jailer and there was a plan to get detainees out. President Barack Obama also had vowed to close Guantanamo, though he has met strong resistance in Congress. Lawmakers repeatedly have added provisions to various bills blocking the government from transferring detainees from Guantanamo to the United States, or barring the construction of facilities domestically to house terror suspects. Rep. Adam Smith, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said the report failed to take into account 'the national security gains of shutting down the facility at Guantanamo. That is a goal that the Bush administration sought to achieve, and it is rightly a goal of the Obama administration. I continue to believe that the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is a black eye for our nation abroad, serving as a powerful recruiting tool for terrorists. 'We have the ability to close the facility, and we should be working towards that end.'",Bush and Obama moved 600 terror suspects amid political pressure .

"By . Beth Stebner and Thomas Durante . Last updated at 3:35 PM on 9th February 2012 . The outraged kids of International Polo Club Palm Beach tycoon John Goodman are demanding that a judge throw out their dad's move to adopt his 42-year-old girlfriend, accusing him of intentionally duping the court. Goodman, 48, is accused of drunk driving and vehicular manslaughter in the death of 23-year-old Scott Wilson in February 2010. In a stunning move last fall, Goodman adopted his girlfriend Heather Laruso Hutchins, 42, entitling her to up to a third of his biological children's trust fund, reportedly worth more than $300million. Scroll down for video . Newest family member: John Goodman, right, adopted his 42-year-old girlfriend Heather Hutchins last fall . Harriet and John Jr - who are in their teens - are now fighting the adoption, charging their father with intentionally committing fraud and making a mockery of the adoption process. The Palm Beach Post reported that a motion was filed in Miami-Dade court on behalf of the children’s guardian, Jeffrey Goddess, arguing that they and their mother had no idea the adoption had taken place until two months after it was finalised. The motion reads: The motion continues, 'If Mr. Goodman would like to protect her and take care of her financially, the obvious solution would be to marry her - not to make her his child.' Victim: Scott Wilson, 23, a graduate of the University of Central Florida, was killed in 2010 . Their attorney, Joseph Rebak told the paper: 'I have never seen anything like this in my 31, 32 years practicing law. Obviously we think it's wrong and we are hoping to have it set aside.' But longtime adoption lawyer Charlotte Danciu told CBS 12 that she’s 'not sure these children will actually have the standing to challenge the adoption.' Goodman’s attorney Daniel Bachi issued a statement last week saying that the . adoption of his girlfriend was intended to help the Trust for his . biological children. He wrote: 'The adoption of Ms Hutchins should have no effect on the . civil proceedings as none of the assets belong to Mr Goodman.' 'The legal adoption of Ms Hutchins does not change that in any way. Ms . Hutchins has no obligation whatsoever to give John B. Goodman a dime.' Another contract between the two states that at least 95 per cent of the trust will ‘ultimately’ go to Harriet and John Jr. He stressed that there is nothing illegal about the adoption. The Wilsons’ lawyer Christian Searcy claims that Goodman still has a . high degree of control over his children’s trust, court papers show. Goodman is being sued by Wilson’s parents for wrongful death. The trial: John Goodman's lawyer said in court that the adoption has nothing to do with his pending criminal trial . Wreckage: Goodman is charged with driving while intoxicated and vehicular manslaughter after police reports show he ran a stop sign and slammed into Scott Wilson's Hyundai, right . According to police reports, Goodman ran a stop sign on February 10, 2010 in Wellington, Florida and smashed into Wilson, sending his car into a canal. Circuit Judge Glenn Kelly had previously ruled that the trust funds set up for his two biological children were off-limits in the lawsuit, according to the Palm Beach Post. Court papers show that Goodman adopted Ms Hutchins in October of last year, CBS12.com reported. The adoption papers state that Ms Hutchins, now a legal child of Goodman, is immediately entitled to at least a third of his trust. Goodman and Ms Hutchins have been dating in 2009, according to her testimony. Arrested: John Goodman faces a criminal trial in March for the DUI death of Wilson . The Wilsons’ attorney, Scott Smith, told the Palm Beach Post that Goodman is attempting to use the adoption to shield his assets. ‘It cannot go unrecognised that [Goodman] chose to adopt his 42-year-old adult girlfriend as opposed to a needy child,' he told the paper. Judge Kelley wrote that the events are taking the court ‘into a legal twilight zone.’ Scott Wilson was a University of Central Florida graduate and was working as a civil engineer. He had been driving his Hyundai home . to Wellington to visit his family, according to the Palm Beach New Times . when he was struck by Goodman's Bentley convertible after he ran a stop sign. Wilson's car was knocked into a nearby canal, where he drowned. Goodman was found to have a blood alcohol level twice the legal limit after the fatal 2010 crash, police reports show. He will be criminally tried March 6, facing charges of DUI manslaughter, vehicular homicide, and leaving the scene of a crash. He could spend up to 30 years in prison if found guilty, the Palm Beach Post reports. The civil trial will be some weeks later on March 27. Goodman’s civil attorney Dan Bachi told myfoxorlando.com that the adoption was meant to secure the assets of his children and family investments, nothing more. ‘It has nothing to do with the lawsuit currently pending against him,’ Mr Bachi said. Celebrity hot spot: John Goodman and Hilary Duff, left, pose with an elephant At International Polo Club annual Polo Ball black-tie gala in 2007 . Goodman’s father was the late Harold Goodman, who built a fortune from a heating and air conditioning manufacturing business. His family sold the business in 2004 for a reported $1.4 billion. He converted his father’s horse farm into a polo ranch and later began building his empire. His club became a magnate for the rich and famous, entertaining the likes of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Sylvester Stallone, and Charlton Heston. Even Madonna was spotted at the club, attending an International Polo Club match in 2009. Goodman’s wealth is a point of a heated dispute. The Palm Beach New Times questioned the heir’s true assets, quoting Mr Wilson’s lawyer. Attorney Chris Searcy said Goodman is much richer than his financial documents show. He is seeking punitive damages that will 'sting [Goodman] badly without bankrupting him,' Mr Searcy told the New Times. According to the website, Mr Searcy thinks Goodman’s wealth is buried in numerous trusts and companies, and is as 'sophisticated' a method as he's ever seen. The financial battle has been closely tied to the wrongful death suit. In 2002, the mogul sold his Wellington estate to his children’s trust fund for $3.8million, according to the New Times. But he only rents it for $2,000 per month. According to an August 2011 report by the Palm Beach Post, his two children have more than $200 million in their trust funds. Mr Searcy suspects he has full control over those trusts. Mr Searcy also said in court that Goodman has an airplane, yacht, polo ponies, and an unspecified amount of his father’s $1.4billion fortune from Goodman Manufacturing. Lap of luxury: The International Polo Club attracts A-list celebrities . Home sweet home: Goodman sold his Wellington mansion to his children's trust for $3.8million and now pays $2,000/month rent . In a 2006 document, Goodman claimed one of his trusts was worth more than $100 million. Mr Searcy pointed out that Goodman claimed in 2011 that trust was only worth $6.9 million. The Wilsons have already settled privately with the Player’s Club, a bar in Wellington where Goodman had been drinking in February 2010. They claimed that the club was partially responsible for the crash because they served Goodman even though he was intoxicated. Lifestyles of the rich and famous: Goodman owns the International Polo Club Palm Beach in Wellington, Florida . The bartenders argued that Goodman wasn’t noticeably drunk. Goodman divorced his first wife Isla Carroll in 2008 after 22 years of marriage. In the April 2009 divorce filing, Ms Carroll said she was fearful for the safety of herself as well as her children. Jeanne T. Tate, a fellow of the American Academy of Adoption Attorneys, has been practicing adoption law for nearly 30 years. She told MailOnline that while nothing illegal was done when John Goodman adopted his girlfriend, she’s seen many cases where adoption ‘is used for purposes other than what you’d traditionally think it was intended.’ In Florida, adult adoptions do not have the same requirements as traditional child adoptions. She explained: ‘A lot of the traditional adoption statutes- including home studies – those protections are eliminated when you’re adopting an adult, with less government intrusion being the goal.’ She said the only people who have to consent in an adult adoption are the adoptee and the adopter. Under Florida law, they do have to give notice of the adoption, though Ms Tate notes that parental consent is not required. ‘The court may not have been aware of many things,’ she said, ‘including that there was a pending wrongful death suit, or that she was a girlfriend.’ When asked if is now legal for Goodman to have sex with his daughter, Ms Tate responded: ‘That’s a good question. I’m not a criminal lawyer, but it’s a solid question to wonder about.’ She said that because they’re both adults and not biologically related, the question’s answer is murky. ‘Creepy,’ she said,’ but I don’t know if that’s illegal.’ Attorney Wayne Richter told MailOnline that under Florida law, the statutory has no law against having sex with an adopted child as long as there is no lineal consanguinity - meaning there is no close blood tie, such as aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew. Ms Tate said that should Goodman wish to marry Ms Hutchins after the criminal case, it would be a difficult endeavour. The statute, she said, is permanent in the eyes of the law. ‘Even for fraud of duress, you have to bring the challenges in front of the court.’ In Florida, all adoption papers are sealed and cannot be viewed by reporters or third parties. ‘A court could order the file open,’ Ms Tate said,’ but it is difficult to do’ – in most cases because of the sensitive nature of protecting identities. Ms Hutchins could in theory, with the consent of Goodman, be re-adopted by her parents and then marry him, Ms Tate said.During Goodman’s civil case, Ms Tate said the court could open the adoption file and examine if there was any fraud on the court or the adoptee (Ms Hutchins). She added: ‘There’s nothing illegal, per se, about adopting your girlfriend.’ Watch video here: .","John Goodman, 48, adopted his 42-year-old girlfriend Heather Hutchins last October; couple has been dating since 2009 .

"By . Lauren Paxman . Last updated at 3:36 PM on 8th February 2012 . Chrissy Bernal was six months into her pregnancy when she realised she was having twins - baby Sienna was so small that she had not been picked up on previous scans. But it was not until six years after her birth that Sienna was diagnosed with primordial dwarfism, a disorder which means she has had a smaller body size than others her age since before she was born. Now 13-years-old, four-foot-tall Sienna can't help but look up to her sister, Sierra who measures 5ft1in. And she will look up to her twin more and more over the coming years - as Sierra is unlikely to grow any taller. Close bond: Sienna looks up to her twin Sierra who is more than a foot taller than she is . The blonde-haired, blue-eyed teens love shopping, wearing make-up and giggling about boys. But due to a rare brain abnormality Sienna also has the learning age of an eight-year-old. Sienna said: 'Most of the time I don't really care I'm different - it actually makes me feel special. 'Sierra looks out for me and we do loads together - shopping, swimming and singing. 'She can be bossy but she shows me how to flirt with boys, stands up for me if I'm teased and reaches things when they're too high.' The sisters were born three months prematurely, with Sienna weighing slightly more than a pound. Doctors warned their mother, Chrissy, 34, that Sierra had just a ten per cent chance of surviving. But after 108 days in neonatal intensive care Sierra was fit enough to join her family at their home near Houston, Texas. Surprise: Sienna, left, was only picked up on ultrasound scans six months into mother Chrissy's pregnancy because she was so small . Growing up together: The blonde-haired, blue-eyed teens love shopping, wearing make-up and giggling about boys. But due to a rare brain abnormality Sienna also has the learning age of an eight year old . It was only when she was six years old that Sienna was diagnosed with primordial dwarfism, a rare form of dwarfism which affects around 200 people in the world. And Sienna is the only primordial dwarf to have an average sized twin. 'In a lot of ways Sienna is just me, but . smaller. Like any sister, she's annoying especially when she steals my . clothes - even though my tops come down to her knees' Chrissy, who lives with her daughters, their step-dad Joey and his son Austin, 17, said: 'Sienna was five weeks behind in development and they said she might not survive - but I refused to believe the worst. 'I had a C-section at 34 weeks. It was terrifying, the girls were tiny and Sienna looked like an alien. 'She had a big head and her skin was see-though. We could hold her in one hand, she wore nappies that were smaller than an iPod, and we bought her dolls' clothes.

"One passenger said he was stuck in a lift and had to be rescued after the power failed . Hit by two power failures across Indian Ocean . By . Richard Shears . Last updated at 1:22 PM on 9th February 2012 . The Queen Mary 2, one of the world's largest ocean liners, has been hit with two power failures that resulted in one passenger having to be rescued from an on-board lift, it was claimed today. The ship known as the 'queen of the seas' arrived in Western Australia yesterday to start her maiden circumnavigation of the continent - but on the way across the Indian Ocean power outages caused problems. One passenger, who asked not to be named, said he was stuck in a lift for about 10 minutes and had to be rescued after electricity failed for about 25 minutes and the engines stopped. Loss of power: Captain of the Queen Mary 2 Christopher Rynd poses on the desk of the Queen Mary 2 - the ship arrived in Western Australia yesterday but on the way across the Indian Ocean power outages caused problems . On her maiden voyage: One passenger, who asked not to be named, said he was stuck in a lift for about 10 minutes and had to be rescued after electricity failed for about 25 minutes and the engines stopped . The Queen Mary 2 is scheduled to sail to Sydney on the next leg of its voyage, before heading north to Queensland, around the top of the continent and back to Fremantle on February 28 . Other passengers, he said, peered over the side of the 151,400-ton vessel wondering what had happened when they realised the four diesel engines had stopped. 'We were stuck in the middle of the ocean without any power,' he told Australian media. 'It was an extraordinary series of events for a ship known as the queen of the seas.' He said the second incident occurred in the early hours of Tuesday during moderately rough seas and strong winds during the liner's voyage from Port Louis, Mauritius, to Fremantle in Western Australia. The vessel stopped for up to 10 minutes with the lights and TV going off for a moment and the engines failing to start up again for up to eight minutes. Not the best start: The vessel stopped for up to 10 minutes with the lights and TV going off for a moment and the engines failing to start up again for up to eight minutes .

Mr David Jones, a spokesman for Carnival, which owns the 1132ft-long ship confirmed there had been 'brief power outages' but said these had occurred during routine maintenance. 'There was a brief power interruption and as expected would normally happen backup systems kicked in, so at all times there was full lighting and all controls were effective and operating normally,' he said. Mr Jones said that passenger safety was not at risk and they would have barely noticed the interruption. Australia's Maritime Safety Authority said it had received reports of a power outage from passengers during the first incident. It was not the first time an alleged power failure has struck the ship. In September 2010 a blackout followed a loud explosion as it approached Barcelona. The Queen Mary 2 is scheduled to sail to Sydney on the next leg of its voyage, before heading north to Queensland, around the top of the continent and back to Fremantle on February 28.","One passenger said he was stuck in a lift and had to be rescued after the power failed .

"By . Rob Waugh . Last updated at 7:55 AM on 9th February 2012 . Canadian telecoms company Rogers and Bell already has Apple's hotly anticipated iTV device in its labs, a report in Canada's Globe and Mail has claimed. Two unnamed sources speaking to the paper report that the flatscreen device will be voice controlled, using software similar to the Siri voice control on iPhone 4S, and will offer iPad-style apps. It will also offer gesture control, with users able to manipulate apps from the sofa using hand gestures to type on an on-screen virtual keyboard. Apple already offers slim flatscreens in its iMac range: Tech insiders widely expect an Apple TV by the end of 2012 - and Best Buy's details tally with several previous rumours . Apple is widely rumoured to be introducing such a device this year. The details tally broadly with details leaked from a survey from U.S retailer . Best Buy - asking customers what they might . think of an 'all-new Apple HDTV'. The . Best Buy survey sparked interest because it was remarkably specific . about details - namely that the device would be a 42-inch 1080p . television, would run Angry Birds and other iPhone-style apps, and would . cost $1499 . iPhone link: The voice-controlled Siri 'personal assistant' is designed so you can . talk to it like a normal person - the ideal way to change channel and . adjust the volume on Apple's new TV? The survey, sent out by Norwegian survey . firm Confirmit, polled customers on what they would think of an upcoming . Apple hi-def television. The survey also claimed that the television would offer remote-control via iPad and iPhone, as well as web TV such as Netflix. The slogan is supposedly, 'Apple finally reinvents what a TV can do.' Less convincingly, the survey also suggested that it would include an iSight camera - a brand Apple no longer uses - and offer Skype, unlikely given that Apple has its own rival, Facetime. The Verge, which found and confirmed the survey, said, 'Is Best Buy speaking with knowledge, or is it just riffing to get a sense of customer interest in a purely theoretical Apple television? Our guess is that it's nothing more than a shot on the dark.' Best Buy's survey has been confirmed to be genuine, and from Norwegian survey firm Confirmit - a partner of the retail giant . The fact that Apple is working on a hi-def television now looks near-certain. Leaks from Apple's manufacturing . chain say that Apple has been working on prototype sets since September - . according to a design blueprint laid down by late CEO Steve Jobs. His 'eureka' moment was realising that Siri's voice control could be used to 'talk' to the set. 'I finally cracked it,' said Jobs. Jobs . was referring to the realisation that the television should be . voice-controlled - using the natural-language algorithms of Siri so that . people talk to the set as they would to someone sitting next to them on . the sofa. Apple TV debuts at Macworld in San Francisco: Reports say that Apple is working on a large, voice-controlled touchscreen with the service built in - but it won't arrive till the price for large touchscreens drops a little . Mr Jobs, who died in October, told author Walter Isaacson: 'It will have the simplest user interface you could imagine.' Apple . executive Jeff Robbin, who was behind the iPod and iTunes Store, is . reportedly 'now guiding Apple's internal development of the new TV . effort'. It's not the first . attempt to bring more 'natural' controls to televisions - companies such . as One For All already make gesture-controlled remotes which you simply . 'wag' at the screen, and Microsoft's Xbox Kinect camera can be . controlled by voice. TV companies such as LG have brought out rival devices in the wake of rumours about Apple TV. LG's 'Magic' remote will be motion controlled and voice controlled. The new 'Magic' voice remote will let users speak to control their televisions - a microphone and voice-recognition software built into the remote make your voice work like an internet search . 'The . new Magic Remote will make it easier for users to approach LG TVs - . particularly our Smart TV function which now has over 1,000 apps,' said . Havis Kwon, president of LG Electronics. But the highly sophisticated Siri software could represent a huge leap forward for the technology.

"By . Suzannah Hills . Last updated at 10:05 AM on 10th February 2012 . Chris Difford, pictured, was allowed to keep his driving licence after magistrates heard losing it would cause him 'exceptional hardship' Squeeze singer and guitarist Chris Difford escaped a driving ban after pleading it would cause 'exceptional hardship' as he would no longer be able to travel the country playing gigs. The 57-year-old, who earns up to £100,000 a year performing around the country, was caught on camera doing 88mph on a 70mph road. And despite already having nine points on his licence, magistrates allowed Difford to keep driving, as a ban would end his 'business' as a solo performer. The court heard that Difford, who had hits with Up The Junction and Cool for Cats with Squeeze in the late 1970s and 1980s, earns around 80 per cent of his income from live shows. Difford, from Dulwich, south London, whose former bandmates include Jools Holland, Glenn Tilbrook and Paul Carrack, said he couldn't take his music equipment on public transport and cannot afford a chauffeur. He said he does not 'get to enjoy' much of his money because his high outgoings, including £30,000 a year school fees for his 16-year-old daughter, are virtually the same as his income. He said: 'There are so many spokes to what I do, and if I was banned from driving then a fair amount of them would fold - probably the ones that make the most money. 'I don't think I can make any further cutbacks.' Difford, who reformed Squeeze with Tilbrook in 2007, was caught speeding on the A31 through the New Forest, near Ringwood, Hampshire, last August. Squeeze band mates: From left to right, John Bentley, Glenn Tilbrook, Chris Difford, Simon Hanson, and Stephen Large . He said he was on his way to Dorset with his partner, who had just been told her ex-husband had died suddenly in France while looking after their three young children. Difford added: 'There wasn't a particularly huge amount of consideration at the time - it was quite stressful.' Magistrates' chairman Ann Press said the speeding offence was 'obviously a serious matter'. However, she accepted the impact a driving ban would have on Difford's family, especially his ability to support his stepchildren 'at a sensitive time in their lives'. She added: 'But you cannot use this excuse again in court.' Difford was fined £350, ordered to pay £85 costs and a £15 victim surcharge, and given three penalty points.","Cool for Cats guitarist Chris Difford caught driving at 88mph on a 70mph road near Ringwood in Hampshire .

"By . Ian Drury . Last updated at 12:00 AM on 10th February 2012 . The cost of Britain’s biggest military programmes has soared by £500million in a year because ‘wasteful’ defence chiefs failed to ‘live within their means’. A withering Commons report today finds that 15 crucial procurement projects are £6.1billion - or 11.4 per cent - over budget. The spiralling bill for new equipment, including ‘hunter-killer’ submarines, fighter jets, aircraft carriers and transport planes, is revealed as the Armed Forces are ordered to make crippling cuts. Axed: The decision to scrap the fleet of Nimrod MRA4 maritime surveillance planes led to £3.4billion of taxpayers¿ money being wasted. Furious commanders are axing 22,000 troops and fleets of warships, ships and armoured vehicles to fill a £42billion black hole in the Ministry of Defence’s budget. But the woeful state of the sprawling department’s finances mean there are ‘significant risks’ that the military will be forced into more ‘unpalatable’ reductions, said MPs on the Public Accounts Committee (PAC). The damning report expressed ‘concern’ that despite the swingeing cuts the price tag for largest equipment programmes had risen £466million in the past 12 months. Since the major projects were originally approved, the cost has rocketed from £54billion to £60billion. And the timetable for delivering the much-needed equipment has slipped by a total of nearly 27 years. The increase has been blamed on ministers adopting a ‘save now, pay later’ approach to buying state-of-the-art hardware. Pushed back: The delay in the completion of seven Astute-class hunter-killer nuclear submarines has increased the bill for them by £1.4billion . The Government has delayed much-needed aircraft carriers and planes and slashed orders for helicopters and trucks in a short-term bid to balance the books, according to the spending watchdog. The MoD’s controversial decision to scrap a fleet of partially-built Nimrod MRA4 maritime surveillance planes led to £3.4billion of taxpayers’ money being wasted. Delaying building seven sophisticated Astute-class nuclear submarines increased the bill by almost £1.4billion to £5.7billion. And pushing back the in-service date of the Royal Navy’s two new 65,000-tonne aircraft carriers has bumped up the price by £1.5billion - to £5.1billion. Modifying the ships with new landing gear - known as ‘cats and traps’ - so planes could take off and land would add another £1.3billion, the PAC reported. In a scathing conclusion, the report said: ‘The taxpayer has too often had to pick up the bill when the risk, complexities and therefore costs have been underestimated.’ Cutting equipment numbers after contracts had been signed also represented ‘poor value for money’ because it ‘invariable’ increased the cost of each unit. The PAC criticised the MoD for having its budget only ‘broadly in balance’ despite the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review and two subsequent cost-saving exercises. MPs also warned that a 1 per cent real terms increase in the equipment budget promised by the Treasury from 2015 might be ‘unrealistic’ because of the current spending squeeze. ‘It is unacceptable that the department still cannot identify the extent of the current gap between resources and expenditure,’ said the report. ‘Until the budget is balanced there remain significant risks to cutting or cancelling existing projects. ‘We remain concerned about the potential consequences to current and future defence programmes if the Department receives lower than expected funding.’ Public Accounts Committee chairman Margaret Hodge, left, said the MoD needed to to be more realistic about the cost of major projects. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, right, said reforms had done much to get to grips with spending . Committee chairman Margaret Hodge said: ‘Rather than the over-optimism which has held sway at the start of major projects, what is needed is realism: about the complexities of projects, the long-term costs of decisions taken today and the implications down the line of short-term budget cuts.’ Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: ‘Through a radical reform programme we have taken firm steps to grip the equipment programme and halt the trend of vast cost increases of the past. ‘The overall increase this year was seven times lower than Labour’s last year in office which saw a cost increase of over £3.3bn. ‘Much has been achieved in clearing up the mess left by the last Government and we are now close to eliminating the black hole in the MoD’s finances and will soon set out an affordable, deliverable programme.’","15 procurement projects have overspend of £6.1billion .

Before adding: 'Sports radio guys in . Boston have called Gisele Yoko Ono for years, but now with her comments . after the Super Bowl, it’s reached a peak. For example, on WEEI this . morning the whole crew ragged on her, saying that she should have kept . her mouth shut.'

"By . Hannah Roberts and Michael Zennie . Last updated at 2:41 PM on 4th February 2012 . The handyman who walked into a police station and admitted to strangling the wife of a wealthy Detroit businessman was released from jail Friday afternoon because authorities claimed they didn't have the evidence to charge him with murder. The release of Joseph Gentz, despite his confession, is just the latest bizarre twist in the unfolding murder mystery of Jane Bashara, who was found dead January 25 in her Mercedes SUV eight miles from her home in the wealthy Detroit suburb of Gross Pointe Park. Gross Pointe Park police offered no . explanation as to why they let Gentz go, saying only: 'Our job as . investigators is to prove facts beyond a reasonable doubt. In doing so, . we must conduct a thorough and complete investigation.' Gentz reportedly told police he killed Mrs Bashara after her husband Bob hired him as a hitman. Free man: Joseph Gentz was released from jail, despite confessing to murdering Jane Bashara. He claimed he was hired as a hitman by Mrs Bashara's husband Bob . When police began to investigate Mr Bashara, they uncovered an S&M sex dungeon equipped with whips and chains. Mr Bashara was also preparing to buy a $245,000 home for his longtime mistress, the Detroit Free Press reported. Police named Mr Bashara the lone 'person of interest' in the case, but he denies he had anything to do with his wife's murder. Instead, his lawyer David Griem suggested Gentz is mentally handicapped and that his story about being hired by Mr Bashara is not credible. Mr Griem said Gentz is the sole person responsible for Mrs Bashara's death. Gentz's release from police custody sparked outrage from Mr Barashara and Mrs Barasha's family. 'It was a shock and I was scared when I learned he had been released,' Mr Bashara's sister Laura Mauer told the Detroit Free Press. Strangled: Jane Bashara was found dead in her Mercedes SUV on January 25 eight miles away from her home. Bob, right, is said to have been having an affair . 'I was horrified because he said he killed dear Jane. I was scared and I wanted some protection over here.' Mr Bashara's lawyer said he requested police protection and surveillance for his house a a result of Gentz going free. The attorney, Mr Griem, says he expects Joseph Gentz, who claims he was . hired by Bob to murder Jane, to be charged for her murder. Painting a possible scenario Mr Griem . told a press conference that Gentz was owed about $2,000 by Mr Bashara, and . may have turned up at the house to collect his money. He . imagined: 'A dispute arose over billing demands made on Bob Bashara by . Joe. Discussions got heated in the past month,' 'My scenario is Jane . pulls into her driveway, Joe walks up demanding money, and an argument . ensues.' Property: Bashara was said to have a 'sex dungeon' with whips and chains in the basement of the Hard Luck bar and Lounge . Griem hypothesized that Gentz could have startled Jane in the garage, causing her to shout and, reacting in anger,  Gentz could have killed her. 'From what we've been told [about the] cause of Jane's death, it would seem that would be the type of thing that could happen between two people,' ABC reported. Gentz could  be charged by Grosse Pointe Park police today, otherwise they would be forced to release him after his 72-hour holding period expired. Gentz walked into a police station earlier this week to admit his part in the murder. He said he acted as the hit man. Police had found a cheque from Bashara to Gentz the day before Jane's death. 'If there's a trial, that's going to be exhibit one for the defense,' Griem said today. 'Who would ever consider hiring a hit man with a cheque signed by that individual?' Griem claimed that Bashara had passed a private polygraph test. 'Accomplice': Joe Gentz told police he was paid less than $2,000 to murder Jane by her husband . Investigators also confirmed they found a 'sex dungeon' in the basement of a property owned by Bob Bashara. The room, filled with whips, chains and a bed, sits beneath the Hard Luck Lounge in Grosse Pointe Park - where Bashara was drinking on the night his wife was killed. Rebecca Delodder and others who live near the Hard Luck Lounge told WJBK-TV that Bob Bashara was often seen coming in and out of the basement over the past few years. Griem insisted reports of the alleged affair and S&M lifestyle were not relevant to theb case and could prejudice any future trial. 'Whether or not Bob has an alternative lifestyle, that doesn't make him a criminal. That doesn't make him a wife killer. What it does, it makes it very difficult for us to get a fair trial if he's charged,' Griem told ABC News.

"By . Steve Doughty . Last updated at 9:05 AM on 7th February 2012 . Dr Rowan Williams yesterday made his most powerful intervention yet in the assisted suicide argument . A new law to legalise assisted dying would be a ‘disaster’, the Archbishop of Canterbury declared yesterday. Dr Rowan Williams said that condoning assisted suicide would undermine the sanctity of life - and he compared its effects to the legalisation of abortion a generation ago. The Archbishop told the Church of England’s parliament, the General Synod: ‘The default position on abortion has shifted quite clearly over the past 40 years. ‘To see the default position shifting on the sanctity of life would be a disaster.’ His warning came as the Synod voted overwhelmingly to condemn the ‘Independent Commission on Assisted Dying’ led by former Labour Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer, which called last month for laws to allow doctors to help the terminally ill to kill themselves. Its members said Lord Falconer’s panel was not independent and had endangered the vulnerable and the disabled. Yesterday Dr Williams made his most powerful intervention into the argument over assisted suicide, which has assumed growing political importance over the past nine years. In that time around 150 Britons have travelled to die at the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland. No relative or friend has been prosecuted for helping, despite the fact that assisting with a suicide is a crime that can attract a 14-year prison sentence. Dr Williams said: ‘Law exists so that people may be protected, especially the vulnerable. Law exists to provide equality of protection for all. What we are faced with in these proposals from the Commission is a legal outcome in which protection is diminished not only for vulnerable individuals but also for medical professionals.’ The Archbishop drew a connection between abortion and assisted dying which suggests he thinks that any assisted dying law would lead to very large numbers of deaths. Abortion was legalised in 1967 with safeguards to assure doubters that it would only be permitted in a small number of cases where a pregnant woman was at risk. However, there are now 200,000 abortions every year and abortion ends more than one in five of all pregnancies in England. In the past nine years around 150 Britons have travelled to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland (pictured) to legally end their lives . Dr Williams said of the proposals from Lord Falconer’s Commission:  ‘To change the law on this subject is to change something vital in our sense of the value of life itself.’ He added: ‘We are not committed to the notion - the eccentric notion - that Christians believe we should cling to life at all costs. ‘We are committed as Christians to the belief that every life in every imaginable situation is infinitely precious in the sight of God. To say that there are certain conditions in which life is legally declared to be not worth living is a major shift in the moral and spiritual atmosphere in which we live. We can be realistic, we can be compassionate, in the application of the existing law.’ The Archbishop said that palliative care for the dying was now at a level in this country where it was the envy of Europe. ‘Anything which changes this level of care is to be resisted with all our power,’ he said. ‘Anything which has the effect of minimising our protection of the most vulnerable is not something to which I believe we could ever assent.’ Elderly patients are going abroad to have their suicidal demands met by foreign doctors . The law against assisted suicide has been effectively eroded by prosecution guidelines published by Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer in 2009. These broadly said that no family member is likely to be charged with assisted suicide if they have helped a love one to die out of compassion rather than greed. Lord Falconer’s Commission proposed a system under which someone given 12 months or less to live would be able to ask a doctor to provide them with poison and help them take it. A series of safeguards to prevent abuse would include checks on the family and on the soundness of mind of the person asking to die. But the Synod was told the Commission’s members were almost all known to be in favour of assisted dying and many influential individuals and charities had declined to help it by giving evidence. Synod member Sarah Finch said: ‘The Commission’s proposals are essentially no different from those presented a few years ago to the House of Lords, where they were rejected on the basis of concerns about public safety.’",Dr Rowan Williams likens assisted suicide to abortion .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 6:00 PM on 5th February 2012 . The husband of the woman found strangled in her car faced some tough questioning from a reporter who quizzed him on everything from his wife's murder to the discovery of a secret sex dungeon at one of his properties. Bob Bashara had his Mother Nancy Bashara and his sister Laura Mauer by his side in the interview, during which he denied having anything to do with his wife's murder. Jane Bashara was found dead on January . 25 in her Mercedes SUV, about eight miles from her home in the wealthy . Detroit suburb of Gross Pointe Park. Denial: Bob Bashara said in an interview yesterday that he had nothing to do with his wife's murder, including the claim that he hired a hit man to kill her . The interview, which aired last night on WDIV, came a day after a handyman who confessed to the murder was released from jail Friday as cops claimed they didn't have the evidence to charge him. Gross Pointe Park police offered no . explanation as to why they let Gentz go, saying only: 'Our job as . investigators is to prove facts beyond a reasonable doubt. 'In doing so, . we must conduct a thorough and complete investigation.' Gentz reportedly told police he killed Mrs Bashara after her Bob Bashara hired him as a hitman. Mr Bashara denied that claim to the Detroit Free Press, saying that Gentz was always be trying to get money off of him, and his requests were getting more desperate in recent weeks. Mr Bashara said: ""He kept calling me, he kept calling me. And the tone of his calls over the past three or four weeks got a little more insistent. ""I need some money. I know you've helped me out, but I need more money"" for a child custody case'. Strangled: Jane Bashara was found dead in her Mercedes SUV on January 25 eight miles away from her home. Bob, right, is said to have been having an affair . He also denied he was having an affair at the time of his wife's murder. When police began to investigate Mr Bashara, they uncovered an S&M sex dungeon equipped with whips and chains. Mr Bashara was also preparing to buy a $245,000 home for his longtime mistress, the Detroit Free Press reported. The room, filled with whips, chains and a . bed, sits beneath the Hard Luck Lounge in Grosse Pointe Park - where . Bashara was drinking on the night his wife was killed. Mr Bashara's lawyer David Griem suggested Gentz is mentally handicapped and that his story about being hired by Mr Bashara is not credible. Mr Griem said Gentz is the sole person responsible for Mrs Bashara's death. Gentz's release from police custody sparked outrage from Mr Barashara and Mrs Barasha's family, who say they do not believe they are safe. 'It was a shock and I was scared when I learned he had been released,' Mr Bashara's sister Laura Mauer told the Detroit Free Press. 'I was horrified because he said he killed dear Jane. I was scared and I wanted some protection over here.' Free man: Joseph Gentz was released from jail, despite confessing to murdering Jane Bashara. He claimed he was hired as a hitman by Mrs Bashara's husband Bob . Mr Bashara's lawyer said he requested police protection and surveillance for his house a a result of Gentz going free. The attorney, Mr Griem, said he expects Gentz, who claims he was . hired by Bob to murder Jane, to be charged for her murder. Painting a possible scenario Mr Griem . told a press conference that Gentz was owed about $2,000 by Mr Bashara, and . may have turned up at the house to collect his money. He . imagined: 'A dispute arose over billing demands made on Bob Bashara by . Joe. Discussions got heated in the past month,' 'My scenario is Jane . pulls into her driveway, Joe walks up demanding money, and an argument . ensues.' Griem hypothesized that Gentz could have startled Jane in the garage, causing her to shout and, reacting in anger,  Gentz could have killed her. Property: Bashara was said to have a 'sex dungeon' with whips and chains in the basement of the Hard Luck bar and Lounge . 'From what we've been told [about the] cause of Jane's death, it would seem that would be the type of thing that could happen between two people,' ABC reported. Gentz could  be charged by Grosse Pointe Park police today, otherwise they would be forced to release him after his 72-hour holding period expired. Gentz walked into a police station earlier this week to admit his part in the murder. He said he acted as the hit man. Police had found a cheque from Bashara to Gentz the day before Jane's death. 'If there's a trial, that's going to be exhibit one for the defense,' Griem said today. 'Who would ever consider hiring a hit man with a cheque signed by that individual?'

"'We don't think more arms into Syria is the answer' says White House . Republican John McCain calls to 'stop the bloodletting' Newborn babies in incubators among at least 100 killed . Three unarmed families murdered in their own homes . By . Stephen Wright . Last updated at 6:10 AM on 9th February 2012 . The White House said the U.S. was not considering arming rebels in Syria but that no option would be completely ruled out as the Obama administration struggled to find a way to quell violence and end the bloodshed. Eighteen premature babies were reportedly among dozens of civilians who died yesterday in one of the bloodiest days . of the Syrian uprising centered on the rebel-held city of Homs. At the State Department, spokesman . Victoria Nuland said that while the U.S. never takes any option off the . table, 'we don't think more arms into Syria is the answer'. White House spokesman Jay Carney said . current deliberations inside the administration were focused on how the . U.S. could provide humanitarian aid to the Syrian people, though he . wouldn't say what form such assistance might take. Scroll down for video . Fleeing: There have been around 100 casualties in the town of Homs in recent days as Syrian rebels taken on government troops during the uprising . High price: The number of civilian casualties is rising in Syria as the violence escalates prompting calls for a stronger military response from the U.S. However a preliminary review of U.S. military readiness was reportedly in hand. A senior U.S. official told CNN: 'The Pentagon is closely monitoring developments in Syria... but absolutely no decisions have been made on military support for Syria.' More than 5,400 people have been killed . in the country since the uprising against President Bashar . Assad's regime began in March, . according to a United Nations toll last month. Hundreds more . are believed to have been killed since then, but the UN says the . chaos in the country has made it impossible to cross-check the figures. Earlier on Tuesday, some congressional . lawmakers, including Republican Senator John McCain, called for the . country to explore the prospect of arming opposition forces in Syria. Senator McCain said: 'We should start considering options, arming the opposition. The bloodletting has got to stop.' McCain was a staunch advocate last year . for the U.S. to arm rebels in Libya in their fight against Muammar Gaddafi . and forces loyal to his regime. The U.S. and NATO did ultimately provide . military help under the cover of a UN mandate. Risks: A Syrian rebel runs for cover during an exchange of fire with army troops, unseen, in Idlib, Syria . Western powers have met repeatedly with . members of Syria's emerging political opposition, but they are wary of . engaging closely with would-be rebel forces without the legal protection . of a similar UN resolution. But in the wake of last weekend's defeat . of a Security Council resolution calling for Assad to step down, western nations have little appetite for another run . at the UN. While the double-veto by Russia and . China at the Security Council Saturday put diplomatic efforts at an . impasse, the White House says it is still loath to consider a military . option. President Barack Obama responded at the weekend on questions as to why the U.S. engaged militarily in Libya, but not in Syria. Divides: Republican Senator John McCain (left) said the U.S. should consider arming rebels while State department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland (right) said she didn't think weapons were the answer . The President said: 'Not every situation is going to allow for the kind of military solution we saw with Libya. I think it is very possible for us to try to resolve this without recourse to outside military intervention.' Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has called for 'friends of democratic Syria' to unite and rally against Assad's regime, previewing the possible formation of a group of like-minded nations to coordinate assistance to the Syrian opposition. Weeping: A man cries as he sits next to a victim of the Homs shelling as Syrian President Assad tried to crush the rebel fighters . Mourning: Rebels attend the funeral killed in clashes with government forces as Assad steps up his crackdown on dissent . Speaking in Bulgaria on Sunday, she said the world had a duty to halt the violence and see Assad out of power. Despite . the continued violence, the White House insists that sanctions and . diplomatic pressure are taking a toll on Assad's regime. 'Ultimately . it needs to result in Assad ceasing the violence, stopping the . brutality and allowing for a transition supported by the Syrian people,' White House spokesman Carney added. The . bloodshed came as reports emerged that 18 premature babies perished . yesterday after their incubators failed during power cuts in the . rebel-held city of Homs. Government militiamen also killed 19 people from three families in the besieged city after storming homes. Although there was no official . confirmation of the babies’ deaths in Homs, activist Mohammad Hassan . confirmed that power had gone down during the terrifying onslaught by . government forces. ‘We counted 47 killed since midnight,’ he said. Russian Minister Sergey Lavrov (left) said he had received assurances from Bashar al-Assad that he was 'completely committed to the task of stopping violence' wherever it may come from .

The 15,000 elite soldiers that make up the force are in charge of training and funding Hezbollah. Bombardment intensified in the early . morning, he added, targeting Sunni Muslim districts all hostile to . Assad, whose minority Alawite sect has dominated Syria for five decades. A group known as the Syrian Revolution . General Commission put the day’s death toll even higher, at 100. Syrian . state television blamed explosions on Homs militants. It accused . ‘terrorists’ of targeting a refinery in the city with mortars, while . activists blamed the army for a fire filmed by residents. Another activist said security forces . had captured a hospital, jailing the injured. The last field hospital in . Baba Amr was bombed on Monday, he said, adding: ‘We lost ten people . when we tried to evacuate it. ‘We are using kitchen knives for . surgery. We don’t have any blood for donations, or oxygen.

"By . Jason Groves and Becky Barrow . Last updated at 9:06 AM on 8th February 2012 . Jobs and prosperity 'for the many' are at stake due to the row over bonuses, according to George Osborne . An anti-business culture is developing in Britain, George Osborne warned last night. The Chancellor said the growing row over fat-cat pay and bonuses was threatening the economy. ‘At stake are not pay packages for a few but jobs and prosperity for the many,’ he told a meeting of the Federation of Small Businesses last night. Mr Osborne insisted the Government had to do more for commerce and that he was battling against a ‘relentless pressure to regulate’ within Whitehall. In a swipe at the BBC, he said: ‘It would be so easy to give into the constant stream of vested interests demanding that you regulate a problem away – every time you are interviewed on the Today programme, or meet with the single issue lobby groups or face the trade union campaigns. ‘Everything in politics encourages more red tape – everyone insists government must step in – “something must be done” is always the cry. We have to resist these pressures.’ The Chancellor said he understood public concern about bonuses, but insisted it must not be allowed to undermine efforts to restore growth by curbing rewards for success. ‘Of course rewards for failure are unacceptable  and those who believe in the free market are the first to say so,’ he added. ‘But a strong, free market economy must be built on rewards for success. There are those who are trying to create an anti-business culture in Britain – and we have to stop them.’ His intervention in London comes days after Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Stephen Hester waived a bonus of almost £1million in the face of intense political and public pressure. Some corporate leaders have warned that political attacks on business could deter investors. The Chancellor's intervention came days after Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Stephen Hester waived a bonus of almost £1million . At the weekend Sir Martin Sorrell, head of the advertising giant WPP, said: ‘If this indiscriminate business bashing continues, the most important engines of economic growth, jobs and government tax revenues – the private sector – will be cowed and hobbled. ‘The alternatives will be to invest and go elsewhere.’ Mr Osborne indicated his support for plans to roll back some employment rights, including a proposal to allow small firms to make ‘no fault’ dismissals of staff with less than two years’ service. Labour last night called on ministers to do more to tackle excessive bonuses, particularly in the banking sector. Chuka Umunna, the party’s business spokesman, said even banks not bailed out by the state enjoyed an ‘implicit taxpayer guarantee’ – placing them under a duty to act responsibly.",Osborne says Government has to do more for commerce .
"By . Leon Watson . Last updated at 8:10 PM on 9th February 2012 . A man has been charged after a 12-year-old girl was stabbed twice in the back close to her home. Lawrence Wood, 31, from Marsh Green, Wigan, Lancashire, will face magistrates tomorrow accused of attempted murder. The unnamed youngster was attacked in broad daylight at about 4.15pm on Wednesday afternoon in a street close to her home in the northern town. Attack: Stranraer Road, Lancashire, where a 12-year-old girl was stabbed yesterday . She was taken to hospital where she underwent emergency surgery after suffering punctured lung. Her injuries are not believed to be life threatening and her condition is described as stable. Wood was originally arrested on . suspicion of wounding with intent, but charged with attempted murder . after questioning by police. Detective Chief Inspector Howard .

More than fifty pink flamingos have been found dead in southern France, victims of freezing weather conditions that have gripped Europe over the past weeks. Firemen who combed waters in Gruissan, in the Aude region, said the birds succumbed to the cold after being trapped in the frozen water and left unable to fly away. The League for Protection of Birds (OPL) picked up some of the other fragile flamingos in the region to transport them to a bird park in Camargue in southern France. Scroll down for videos . Frozen to death: A fireman recovers the body of one of the dead flamingos from icy waters in southern France . Sapped energy reserves: A fireman hands a severely weakened flamingo to his colleague as a major operation got under way to rescue any survivors . Rare occurrence: The cold weather has sapped their energy reserves, preventing the birds from flying away from the perilously cold water . Francis Morlon, Director of the OPL, said: 'These birds have suffered from the cold wave. The ten days of cold have weakened them and so their energy reserves have reduced. 'And what happened was that, on Monday, we had winds of 120km/h and so the birds were not able to flee the peak of the cold and all the ponds of the region have frozen. 'It's pretty rare. Really, the last time we recovered so many flamingos was in 1985. After that, every year we catch young flamingos weakened by the cold, or who face other problems like food etc, but never on such a large scale.' As the birds were being bandaged in black cloth and put into large cartons for transportation, firemen combed nearby ponds to look for other flamingos trapped in the ice, a task made difficult by the slippery ground and by the birds themselves who tried hard to get away. In a flap: Efforts to rescue the birds was made all the more difficult because of their instinct to get away . Macabre: The flamingos were found dead and dying in waters in the Aude region of southern France . Hope: Firemen pack the birds into boxes ready to be transported to a bird park in Camargue . Back on their feet: Some of the rescued flamingos regain their strength at the bird sanctuary . Meanwhile, Serbia was struggling to keep its power system going after weeks of record-low temperatures in Europe that have snarled traffic, frozen rivers and challenged officials to step up outreach to the vulnerable homeless. The Serb state power company said its system cannot hold on for much longer and authorities urged citizens to save electricity in an appeal aired on national television. Europe's big freeze so far has claimed hundreds of lives, mostly of homeless people, while tens of thousands more remain trapped in remote villages in Bosnia and Serbia and other hard-hit areas. Plunging temperatures: A boat makes its way through floating ice on the river Elbe in Hamburg, northern Germany, today . Frozen still: A man stands on the banks of the river Danube, where shipping has been halted by massive ice floes . Big freeze: Boats are left locked in the ice on the Danube in Belgrade, Serbia . Homeless people are queueing up for free rooms in an Austrian brothel after its owner said it would be unfair not to do everything he could during the current cold spell. Peter Laskaris (above), owner of the Red Rooms Laufhaus in the capital Vienna, is offering 10 people a night a bed in his brothel, including a hot shower and a hot meal. He said: 'We are not really doing much business in the current cold weather anyway and it is the school holidays - a lot of people are off away with their families. 'Lots of our rooms are empty and it seemed a shame not to use them for a good cause.'In these cold temperatures nobody should be left out on the streets.' But he added: 'Other services are not included.' In many European capitals, authorities . have set up extra shelters for the homeless to help them survive the . cold snap that has seen temperatures sink as low as -33F (-36C). In Berlin, rescue vans loaded with food and clean sheets are picking up those in need and taking them to shelters. 'I witnessed a man laying on the street and people were passing by, not caring about him,' said Wolfgang Gerhard, a pastor who works for the Berlin city mission and drives one of its two rescue vehicles. 'And that's what moves me: that someone could die on a street and nobody calls an ambulance.' The cold and snow have blocked roads, halted shipping on rivers and forced schools to close in many countries. Massive ice floes have halted shipping on parts of the mighty Danube, Europe's main commercial waterway, which winds 2,860kilometres (1,777miles) from Germany to the Black Sea. Authorities in Serbia plan to use explosives to break the ice to try to prevent flooding of the kind that hit Greece and Bulgaria on Monday and Tuesday, leaving dozens of homes under water and at least eight dead. Elsewhere in the region, rescue services have been using helicopters to reached stranded people and deliver food to snowed-in regions. TV stations showed images of people digging tunnels to get out of their homes in the village of Rubla in eastern Romania, where dozens of communities were left without electricity or water. Some people said they were melting snow and drinking it because they couldn't get fresh water from frozen wells. Used banknotes are being compressed into blocks and handed out to hard-up families to heat their homes during the current freezing weather in Hungary. Cash taken out of circulation is shredded and reformed to make fuel for burning as temparatures plunge to minus 20 degrees in the eastern European country. The nation's central bank said it took around five million Hungarian forints - worth £13,000 - to make a one kilogramme block. Money to burn: Piles of shredded, disused banknotes are distributed at the Foundation to Help Autism in Miskolc, eastern Hungary, to help heat the building . Helping hand: Each block uses around five million Hungarian forints - worth £13,000 - in old notes . Around five tonnes of the recycled cash is now being handed out each week to charities, allowing families to save about 150 pounds a month on their fuel bills, central bank spokesman Barnabas Ferenczi said. He added: 'Every year, we withdraw about a quarter of all banknotes from circulation or around 200 billion forints. 'Until now, we hand been incinerating them, but because they burn so well we are now reproccessing them as fuel. 'This process is done in a secure facility, but because the banknotes are still legal tender and staff are surrounded by billions of forints, we have issued them all with overalls without pockets.'","Dozens of birds recovered after being left too weak to fly from frozen waters .

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 6:13 PM on 8th February 2012 . 'Ticking timebomb': RBS chief executive Mr Hester, who earns £1.2million a year and is pictured today, said the spotlight the bank has been put under has made his job more difficult . Royal Bank of Scotland chief-executive Stephen Hester said today it would have been 'indulgent' to resign in a row over his £1million bonus. Mr Hester - who earns £1.2million a year - said pay fairness should not be achieved by 'cutting down success.' He caved in and waived a near £1million performance payout for 2011 after intense public and political pressure. Mr Hester said he surrendered the bonus - to be paid in shares - because of the damage the row was doing to the bank. Speaking publicly for the first time after the furore, he suggested it would have been an easy decision to walk out of the bank once his bonus came under threat. Mr Hester told BBC Radio 4's Today . programme: 'I am not a robot and there has been some deeply depressing . moments over the last three years. 'In the end, I came to the conclusion that it would be indulgent for me to resign.' He said he 'drew on inner strength' to continue at the bank which is 83 per cent owned by the taxpayer. Mr . Hester added he had been tasked with 'defusing a ticking timebomb' and the spotlight placed on him made the job more difficult. The 51-year-old said it was wrong to attack successful people - although added that what bankers are paid is a political decision. 'I believe strongly in issues to do with equality of opportunity. I believe in a progressive tax system - I have no problem in paying more tax,' he said. 'But I don't think cutting off success or cutting down success is the way to go about fairness in society.' He caved in and surrendered his bonus after Labour’s announced it would force a Commons debate on the payments at the bank, allowing MPs to vote on the bonus. Resignation fears: RBS chief executive Stephen Hester revealed today he nearly quit in a row over his bonus. He is pictured speaking to journalists today . Stephen Hester may have waived his £963,000 shares bonus - but he could still walk away with £39m during his time at RBS. The bank had already set aside £3.3million for Mr Hester’s bonus next year. That is on top of the potential £35.5million package he has enjoyed since he moved to RBS in 2008. It is made up of pay, pension, bonuses, shares and a long-term incentive plan that is worth up to £4.8million a year, four times his £1.2million basic salary, and is due to start paying out from 2014 if he hits certain targets. This is how it is calculated: . 2008: £4.99million in shares instead of pay and bonuses; . 2009: £6.9million total package; . 2010: £8.16million total package; . 2011: £8.08million total package; . 2012: £7.38million total, including up to £4.8million long-term incentive plan, salary of £1.2million, £420,000 in pension contributions and his bonus which was worth £963,000 when issued last week but was expected to top £1million as RBS shares rise in value. The bonus has, of course, now been waived. 2013: RBS have set aside £3.3million of shares for his bonus next year. The exact size will be decided this time next year. Mr Hester’s shares-only . payment was worth around £963,000, but he could yet pocket as much as . £39million in total during his time with RBS. The bank had already set aside £3.3million for Mr Hester’s bonus next year. He said he surrendered the 2011 payment because it was hurting the bank. 'I took the judgment that it was . going to be damaging for RBS to stay in the intensity of the spotlight . that we had got into,' he said. Mr Hester spoke publicly for the . first time about his decision to waive his bonus today after revealing . to staff that the restructuring of RBS has already cost £38billion. The money has gone on disposing of assets, loan losses and restructuring charges. The Government's stake in the bank cost £45billion and the final cost of the restructuring could yet surpass this. Mr Hester said today that while he had 'great sympathy and understanding' for people concerned about the high rewards in the banking industry, such 'societal issues' were ultimately a matter for politicians. He said it was essential that RBS was able to recruit the best people to resolve the problems it had inherited from the former management, which led to it being bailed out by the taxpayer. 'When I was asked to take on this job three years ago, I had to replace the whole senior management team of RBS,' he said. 'We had to go around the world looking for the best people, not just people to run a bank well, but people to defuse the biggest timebomb in history in terms of bank balance sheets. 'Those people are doing a good job. I think they deserve recognition. If they do a good job, it is our task to make sure that there is a connection between the job people are doing and how they get treated.' Fat cats: Mr Hester's near £1million bonus payout for 2011 sparked a public and political outcry . Mr Hester acknowledged that bank bonuses were controversial but said RBS had not realised what a storm his award would create. 'I understand why these issues are controversial - particularly in a time of austerity. Of course, we underestimated that, going forward,' he said. He admitted the banks had been guilty of 'hubris' after 20 years of 'unbridled expansion' leading up to the crash of 2008. 'I think in the case of the banking industry there was over-confidence and, with the benefit of hindsight, over-rewards,' he said. However he warned it was important not to 'demonise' a sector which remained essential to the economy. 'Let's not demonise a whole industry. Let's not demonise something that is fundamental to the world economy,' he said. 'Banking is important, financial services is important. It supports the economy, it supports millions of jobs and we need to remember that.' While he acknowledged that as a largely state-owned organisation, RBS would be held to a higher standard than other banks, he said it could not be treated completely differently. 'It may make our job more difficult. We have to try to behave in a way that also leads on some of these difficult issues of how we interact with society,' he said. 'We can't be completely different from all the people against who we compete but I accept that we need to have a sensitivity.' He added: 'We would make a mistake as a society if we forget how wealth is generated, how successful people are motivated.' Stripped: Fred Goodwin today faced calls to be stripped of this honorary degree he received from St Andrews University . Fred Goodwin should be stripped of his honorary degree, students at a top university said today. The former RBS chief - stripped of his knighthood last week - was made a Doctor of Laws by St Andrews University in Scotland in 2004. But the Students' Association has now called for the university to revoke the degree because of his role in the collapse of Britain's biggest bank. President Patrick O'Hare said: 'We believe that keeping in place an honorary degree for someone like Fred Goodwin runs contrary to the values of the University of St Andrews. 'Fred Goodwin, of course, is not solely responsible for the banking crisis although his awards were made for ‘services to banking' - a statement which has no foundation. 'Fred ‘the Shred' has, over the course of the banking crisis, become a symbol of arrogance, misjudgement and greed which many people feel has become endemic within our banking system. 'To defend the award devalues our system of honorary graduates such as Sir David Attenborough and Sir Peter Lampl who have gained one through their contributions to society. 'If the Queen and the Forfeiture Committee can take the extraordinary measure of revoking his knighthood, then it seems fairly obvious that the university can do the same with his honorary degree.' But a university spokesman insisted that Goodwin was given an honorary degree in 'good faith' and there were no plans to remove it. He added: 'Clearly, a great deal has changed since that time. The university is very sensitive to the varied opinions expressed about Mr Goodwin's part in the collapse of RBS and its damaging effects on the economy and the lives of many thousands of people. 'Revoking the degree, however, cannot change history, nor ameliorate the harm done by by the banking collapse, for which many people and institutions, not just the one man, are responsible. 'In these circumstances, the university will not be pressured into making the precipitate gesture of revoking Mr Goodwin's degree.'","RBS boss: 'I was tasked with defusing a ticking timebomb at bank'

Last updated at 6:08 AM on 10th February 2012 . A mentally ill man admitted today to terrorising Ivanka Trump with a barrage of creepy emails, tweets and online videos along with threatening to commit suicide in her Manhattan jewellery store. Justin Massler, who for months had been deemed psychologically unfit for trial, pleaded guilty to aggravated harassment and criminal contempt charges. He was sentenced at a Manhattan court to six months in prison which he has already served, plus five years of probation, during which . he must continue psychiatric treatment and medication. Obsession: Justin Massler (left) pleaded guilty at a Manhattan court after stalking Ivanka Trump (right). He was freed after having already served six months but was put on probation for five years . Dynasty: Ivanka with her billionaire father Donald Trump have taken court orders to prevent their schizophrenic stalker approaching them . Massler, from Reno, Nevada, had become fixated with Ms Trump, the daughter of tycoon Donald Trump and his ex-wife Ivana, saying in his dream life he wanted to marry her. Prosecutors said that his remarks had become ominous after he threatened to commit suicide in the model and businesswoman's store. During his two-year obsession, Massler also said he wanted to 'talk some sense into' her husband, . Jared Kushner and 'commandeer' the New York Observer which Mr Kushner publishes. According to the Manhattan district attorney's office, Massler wrote an email to the newspaper in August saying: 'I won't be ignored.' Double threats: Both Ivanka Trump and her publisher husband Jared Kushner were subjected to a barrage of emails, tweets and online videos from schizophrenic Justin Massler . Massler, 29, also said he would die before being caught and 'would go down in a hail of gunfire'. He posted bizarre YouTube clips in which he insisted aliens were forcing him to continue stalking the successful entrepreneur, according to the New York Post. Even after his arrest and a court order to stay away from Ivanka Trump, star of Celebrity Apprentice, and her family, Massler continued to try to contact them. Massler, who had his name legally changed to Cloud Starchaser and told authorities his address was 'a volcano in Hawaii', is schizophrenic and has a history of psychiatric hospitalizations, said his lawyer George Vomvolakis.

"By . John Stevens . Last updated at 9:34 PM on 10th February 2012 . Two Christian hotel owners who refused to let a gay couple share a room have been told that the rights of homosexuals come before those of Christians in the eyes of the law. Peter and Hazelmary Bull yesterday lost their appeal against an order to pay thousands of pounds in compensation to two gay men who booked an £80-a-night double room at their  Cornish B&B. The Court of Appeal told Mr and Mrs Bull that they were entitled to express their beliefs, but not if they were incompatible with the rights of gay people. 'Decent': Peter and Hazelmary Bull from Marazion, Cornwall, who refused two gay men to stay in the same room of their guest house . The landmark ruling by the three Appeal Court judges confirmed the supremacy of gay rights over Christian belief under the Sexual Orientation Regulations brought in by the Labour party. Mr and Mrs Bull, 71 and 66, run Chymorvah House in Marazion. In September 2008 they accepted a booking for an £80-a-night double room from Steven Preddy, 38, believing he would be staying with his wife. But when Mr Preddy arrived with his 46-year-old civil partner Martyn Hall, the men were told that they could have two rooms, but not share one. In January last year Judge Andrew Rutherford ruled at Bristol County Court that the Bulls had breached equality legislation and ordered them to pay the couple a total of £3,600 damages. In their appeal, lawyers for the Bulls told the appeal court judges that the couple thought any sex outside marriage was a ‘sin’. They denied that they had discriminated against Mr Hall and Mr Preddy, from Bristol, because they had also barred unmarried heterosexual couples from sharing double rooms since they opened for business 25 years ago. Picturesque: Mr and Mrs Bull's Chymorvah House hotel in Marazion, Cornwall . But yesterday Sir Andrew Morritt, Chancellor of the High Court, Lord Justice Hooper and Lady Justice Rafferty, sitting at the Court of Appeal in London, unanimously dismissed their plea. Lady Justice Rafferty said: ‘Whilst the appellants’ beliefs about sexual practice may not find the acceptance that once they did, nevertheless a democratic society must ensure that their espousal and expression remain open to those who hold them. ‘However, in a pluralist society it is inevitable that from time to time, as here, views, beliefs and rights of some are not compatible with those of others. ‘As I have made plain, I do not consider that the appellants face any difficulty in manifesting their religious beliefs, they are merely prohibited from so doing in the commercial context they have chosen.’ Victorious: Steven Preddy, left, and Martin Hall outside Bristol County Court after an earlier hearing. They are now due thousands in damages . The taxpayer-funded state equality body, the Equality and Human Rights Commission, had backed Mr Preddy and Mr Hall in their action. Outside court, John Wadham of the EHRC said: ‘We believe that this case will help people to better understand the law around freedom of religion. ‘When offering a service, people cannot use their beliefs, religious or otherwise, to discriminate against others.’ But Simon Calvert, of the Christian Institute, which funded Mr and Mrs Bull’s appeal, said: ‘Something has gone badly wrong with our equality laws when good, decent people like Peter and Hazelmary are penalised but extremist hate preachers are protected.’ Neither couple was in court for the hearing.",Peter and Hazelmary Bull lost their appeal against an order to pay thousands in damages to the couple .

A Nazi surgical equipment set owned by an SS commandant and war criminal has been withdrawn from a sale today after phone and e-mail threats. The wooden box of tools . belonged to Anton Burger, a major in the SS who worked at the . Theresienstadt concentration camp between July 1943 and February 1944, . where 140,000 Jews were held  -  and 33,000 of them died. The set had been due to go under the hammer at Villa Hall Auctions in Bude, Cornwall, tomorrow. The wooden box of tools belonged to Anton Burger, a major in the SS who oversaw the Theresienstadt concentration camp between July 1943 and February 1944 . Disturbingly, given the contents of the box, there is no evidence that Sturmbannfuhrer Burger ever received medical training. A separate layer above the forked hooks reveals a sinister set of scissors . The case is marked 'instrumente gemischte', German for 'mixed instruments'. This has led to the theory it may have been part of the deception to fool the Red Cross into thinking it was for musical instruments . Austrian-born Burger was sentenced to death after the war but fled and lived under an assumed name, eventually dying in Germany in 1991 at the age of 80 . The police said the messages prompted . safety concerns for staff and there will be a police presence at the . auction even though the controversial lot has been withdrawn. The set contains instruments that would have been used in amputations including a saw and scalpels. It belonged to a late Jewish man whose . wife is the current owner. The man's own parents survived the camp . where they were held and married. Grace Cloke, partner at the Bude . auction house, said: 'We've had phone calls and e mails which were not . of a particular nice nature. 'Some were pretty threatening and the . police were concerned that an activist group might turn up. Some of the . contact was from people who had lost family members during the war and . were not happy with the auction. 'But there were a few that were really unpleasant. One said ""I hope you die of cancer"". 'It's shame as our vendor was going to . donate the money to the War Child charity. None of us felt particularly . comfortable about the sale but the money was going to a good cause.' The set had a guide price of £2,000 and it had been hoped a museum would have bought it.

Deputies, the main representative body of British Jews, said that 'to . seek to profit from such ghoulish objects is deeply troubling'. Other . Jewish groups, including the Anne Frank Trust and Holocaust Educational . Trust, said that the collection should be placed in an educational . context, such as a museum. Theresienstadt was used as a . propaganda tool during the Second World War, with the Germans trying to . fool the world that it was a 'paradise camp'. Theresienstadt, near what is now the town of Terezin in the Czech Republic, acted as a ghetto for 140,000 Jews, with 33,000 dying there during the war and 88,000 taken from it to extermination camps such as Auschwitz and murdered . Gillian . Walnes, executive director of the Anne Frank Trust UK . 'Inexplicably there are those who . have a grotesque fascination with Nazi memorabilia and instruments used to . inflict suffering on innocent adults and children. 'I . therefore hope that this item will be acquired by a respected museum or . academic institution that will use it for educational purposes.' Jon Benjamin, chief executive of the Board of Deputies . 'There . is understandably a continuing fascination with this tragic part of our recent . history, and along with the countless books and films on the subject, from time . to time artefacts emerge that testify to the horrors of the Holocaust. 'These things serve to remind us of the terrible events that happened, and . incontrovertibly show the claims of Holocaust deniers for the lies that they . are. 'However, to seek to profit from such ghoulish objects, and to risk . that they might fall into the hands of admirers of the Nazis, is deeply . troubling. A more fitting home would be in a museum or suitable historical . archive somewhere.' Karen Pollock, chief executive . of the Holocaust Educational Trust . 'Wherever possible we believe . Holocaust-era items should be presented in an educational context, so that as . many people as possible can learn about what took place during that appalling . time.' They even made a film showing happy . workers shoeing horses and making handbags, while children played . football or ate sandwiches to add to the deception. Burger played a key role in covering . up the true horrors of the camp during stage-managed visits by the Red . Cross - which were used to . help conceal the sickening purpose behind it and other camps from the . watching . world. Disturbingly, given the contents of the . box, there is no evidence that Sturmbannfuhrer Burger ever received medical training. The mostly monogrammed equipment was put up for sale by an anonymous . seller. Before the withdrawal, Ms Cloke explained that the husband of the vendor . was Jewish, and his parents met and married at a concentration camp in Austria. Ms Cloke said: 'This set was always in . their home while they were married. 'He wouldn't talk about his history but he . used to spend a lot of time researching the Second World War.' The vendor's husband passed away . some years ago and she lost contact with his family so she still does not know . how he came to own the instruments. Ms Cloke added: 'The father [of the vendor's husband] used to deal during the war in the black market so we don't . know whether they were in the camp and were able to take it or whether it came . through the black market somehow,' she said. 'It is something we are never going . to know.' The camp, near what is now the town of . Terezin in the Czech Republic, acted as a ghetto for 140,000 Jews, with 33,000 . dying there during the war and 88,000 taken from it to extermination camps such as . Auschwitz and murdered. Just 1,900 were still alive when the . ghetto was liberated by Soviet troops on May 7, 1945. Burger was ordered by SS leader Heinrich . Himmler and Adolf Eichmann, the orchestrator of the mass movement of Jews to camps . in Eastern Europe, to change the appearance of Theresienstadt to fool Red Cross . members who had requested access to a Nazi concentration camp. Many inmates were temporarily removed from . the overcrowded camp and cosmetic changes made to fool the inspectors. James Kendling from Villa Hall Auctions holds the macabre box, which was expected to fetch £2,000-£4,000 . Fake shops and cafes were erected to give the . false impression that inmates had a life of relative comfort. The Red Cross representatives seemed to . fall for the deception and the Nazis went on to make a propaganda film at the . camp. The fact that the wooden instrument case . is marked 'instrumente gemischte', German for 'mixed . instruments', has led to the theory that this may have been made as part . of the deception, to suggest it was for musical instruments. A man lights a candle at an oven used during WWII to burn human corpses as members of Czech Jewish community observe Holocaust Remembrance Day in the former Nazi concentration camp of Theresienstadt . 'Anton Burger was charged with . changing the appearance of the camp, and a lot of the Jews there were musical . so it is possible it was made to look like a musical instrument case,' Ms . Cloke said. Austrian-born Burger was sentenced to . death after the war but fled and lived under an assumed name, eventually dying . in Germany in 1991 at the age of 80. It was only three years after his death, . in 1994, that anyone found out who the dead man really was. Museums and other institutions showed an interest in the sale and Ms Cloke said they hoped . it would go to an organisation that would be able to use it in a positive, . educational setting.","Box was property of SS major Anton Burger, who ran concentration camp .

"By . Manoj Joshi, Gyanant Singh and Gautam Datt . Last updated at 1:11 AM on 11th February 2012 . It was said of another general several millennia ago that he came, he saw and he conquered. Army chief General V.K. Singh will probably realise too late, that living in a democratic polity the choice of the outcome depended not on his military skills, but the decision of two wise men who had probably never heard a gunshot fired in anger. In the process, he not only failed to get any redress from the Supreme Court in his dispute over his age, but also lost the moral confidence to continue in office. Losing battle: General V.K. Singh could now be forced to resign after his claim against the government was rejected . Justice R.M. Lodha and Justice H.L. Gokhale compelled him to withdraw his age row petition before the Supreme Court after saying that it was not inclined to interfere with the government's decision to consider his date of birth in the service records to be May 10, 1950, as against May 10, 1951. They said that unless the decision was 'perverse or grossly erroneous' it could not be interfered with in a petition under Article 32, which the General had invoked to directly move the apex court against the alleged injustice. The fact that the age issue had gained such public currency, the question being asked all around was whether the General would now step down. Speaking to Headlines Today, Lt Gen (retd) Raj Kadyan said that the army chief's position was diminished in the eyes of his contemporaries and his men and it would be best if he resigns. 'I am dejected that he gave up the fight,' he said. 'He should not have withdrawn his petition [and fought on].' General V.K. Singh with Defence Minister A. K. Antony. Despite the army chief withdrawing his petition, the ties between him and government have become frosty . His words were echoed by Major General (retd) G.D. Bakshi who felt that General Singh ought to resign. He said that the army chief had done the right thing by fighting the issue to the bitter end and that he would not be surprised if indeed he resigned. It is a fact that the entire community of retired military personnel had strongly supported General Singh's petition and that the Supreme Court decision will have major reverberations, especially if General Singh does not step down from office. Many former military personnel have seen . the controversy as being akin to that faced by the revered Army chief, . General K.S. Thimayya, in 1959. The then army chief had resigned because . of the interference by the then defence minister, Krishna Menon. But . Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had persuaded him to withdraw his . resignation, but later humiliated him by refusing to act on the issues . Thimayya had raised. For the ex-servicemen fraternity, the Thimayya (who served as chief from 1957- 1961) issue is not history, but a contemporary comment on the shoddy manner in which the political and bureaucratic community has dealt with the uniformed personnel. The court's position clearly indicated its unwillingness to delve into a quarrel between two important arms of the government - the army and the ministry of defence. 'If it has come to the stage of washing dirty linen, you can do so,' Justice Lodha told the defence counsel at one point. 'But we thought both sides had been dignified and would not cross the line.' The apex court's position echoed by many in the country was that this was a quarrel that should never have seen public light, and now that it had, it should be swiftly brushed under the carpet. But it was not just a matter of appearances, but of the fact that any order or decision by the court would have become a precedent and could have roiled the issue of the selection and tenure of the army chief. In that sense, the court felt that it was best if it said nothing. This was, after all, a personal matter relating to a claim of a date of birth. It was not a charge relating to corruption or some other act of criminality which the court would have found difficult to sidestep. General Singh left for the South Western Command in Jaipur soon after his petition on the date of birth row was withdrawn, signalling that it was business as usual for him and it was left for his aides to speculate that 'anything can happen' on the question if he was contemplating resignation. Brothers in arms: General Singh with Lt Gen KT Parnaik . Though the government withdrew the order which had been objected to by the court during the last hearing, it seemed to be a lost case for the General the moment proceedings started on Friday. The Bench kept the General's counsel on the back-foot throughout the hearing by seeking explanations on Singh having himself mentioned the wrong date of birth on more than one occasion, on several documents recording 1950 as his date of birth, on not getting the error rectified within the time-frame set out in the rules and on not abiding by his repeated commitments to treat the matter closed. The court pointed out that the General had himself given a commitment to accept the decision by the government on the controversy and had accepted 1950 as the year of his birth. Referring to three letters by the General undertaking to abide by any decision in the interest of the organisation, the court said it was a well thought decision by him as he 'stated, restated and further reiterated' his commitment. 'There may be many explanations for retracting from the commitment…But I do not think it would behove such a meritorious officer to take that position,' Justice Lodha said. Justice Gokhale, who was harsher, . said: 'You could have gone to court (instead of agreeing to accept May . 10, 1950, as your date of birth). But you did not and became the chief . of armed staff. 'You may be . justified in raising a grievance. But this date (May 10, 1950) has been . there over a period of time and last three promotions had been on this . date,' the Bench said. He said the court had no doubt he was honestly pursuing the matter and being the army chief he had every right to agitate his grievance before the highest court. He said everyone was proud of him defending the country. 'Judges do what others avoid. We have to take a decision ultimately,' he said, sympathising with him. The only positive outcome of this sad controversy is that it may compel the government to pay serious attention to the dysfunctional relations between the civilians and the armed forces personnel in the ministry of defence. Though the government claims that everything is fine, there is a gap which is getting worse by the day. A great deal of responsibility for this lies with the arrogance of the bureaucracy, which lacks the expertise to deal with military subjects and simply lacks an understanding of the military culture and ethos. By GYANANT SINGH . Out of time: General V.K. Singh was told that the record of his age had been on file for some time and he had not previously challenged it . Army chief General Vijay Kumar Singh on Friday withdrew his petition on the age row after the Supreme Court indicated that it was not inclined to interfere with the government's decision to consider his date of birth in the service records to be May 10, 1950 as against May 10, 1951. A bench comprising Justice R.M. Lodha and Justice H.L. Gokhale said unless a decision is 'perverse or grossly erroneous' it could not be interfered with in a petition under Article 32, which the General had invoked to directly move the apex court against the alleged injustice. The bench, however, observed that it had the highest regard for General Singh and its order should not come in way of the assignment he was holding. 'As the chief of armed services, you continue to serve the way you served (the army) for the last 38 years,' it said. Referring to other assignments that he might get after retirement, Attorney General G.E. Vahanvati said he hoped and prayed that this was not the end of General Singh's service to the nation. Though the General withdrew his petition, the decision should not be interpreted as a thaw in the relationship between him and the government. This was evident during the fag end of the hearing itself. On someone suggesting that the court could record in its order that the matter had come to an end following an amicable settlement, Vahanvati said: 'No. There is no amicable settlement.' Earlier, General Singh's counsel U.U. Lalit, having been pushed to the wall with the court rejecting most of his arguments, stressed that the controversy had arisen because the government perhaps had some succession plan in mind. 'As a counsel, I cannot say certain things that have happened,' he said. 'If it has come to the stage of washing dirty linen, you can do so... But we thought both sides had been dignified and would not cross the line,' Justice Lodha said. Though the government withdrew the order which had been objected to by the court during the last hearing, it seemed to be a lost case for the General the moment proceedings started on Friday. The bench kept the Singh's counsel on the backfoot throughout the hearing by seeking explanations on the General having himself mentioned the wrong date of birth on more than one occasions, on several documents recording 1950 as his date of birth, on not getting the error rectified within the time-frame set out in the rules and on not abiding by his repeated commitments to treat the matter closed.

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 9:02 PM on 10th February 2012 . The rising star of the New York Knicks might be setting alight the basketball world by leading his team to three straight wins - but he doesn’t quite yet live the high life enjoyed by some of his team-mates. Jeremy Lin, 23, is currently living on his brother's sofa in Manhattan’s student-dominated Lower East Side - but the Harvard University graduate wants to buy a more permanent high-end property. The star from Palo Alto, California, whose parents are from Taiwan, scored 23 points and enjoyed a career-high 10 assists to lead the Knicks to a 107-93 rout of the Washington Wizards on Wednesday. Scroll down for video . Rising star: New York Knicks point guard Jeremy Lin, left, drives to the basket past Washington Wizards guard Shelvin Mack, right, at the Verizon Center during an NBA game in Washington D.C. on Wednesday . The 6’3” 200lbs economics graduate, who was signed from Golden State Warriors two months ago, is living with his brother Joshua, a New York University dental student, reported the New York Post. He has been shown two luxury properties by a broker. One is owned by another Knicks player in New York City and the other is close to the side’s practice centre in Greenburgh, New York state. Lin is the NBA's first Chinese-American and fifth Asian-American. The fervour around his recent amazing performances is dubbed ‘Linsanity’ and he has rescued an otherwise-dire Knicks season. He will be paid a minimum of $613,567 next season and is expected to star as the Knicks take on the Los Angeles Lakers at Madison Square Garden in Manhattan tonight, reported the New York Post. ‘We never expected anything like this,’ Lin’s dad, Gie-Ming Lin, who has travelled from California to watch his son tonight, told the New York Post. ‘It’s like this happened overnight. We can’t believe it.’ Popular: The star (17) from Palo Alto, California, whose parents are from Taiwan, scored 23 points and enjoyed a career-high 10 assists to lead the Knicks to a 107-93 rout of the Washington Wizards on Wednesday . Mr Lin said he brought up his three sons in California with the understanding that their academic education was first, but they were encouraged to train and joined church basketball leagues. 'We never expected anything like this. It’s like this happened overnight. We can’t believe it' Gie-Ming Lin, Jeremy Lin’s father . Meanwhile his son Jeremy is making the Knicks must-see TV in Asia, where the NBA’s partners have added games to their broadcast schedules. Sina in China will show Friday's Lakers game, while stations in Taiwan will show Knicks games this month against Toronto, Sacramento, New Orleans, New Jersey and Atlanta. Lin has led the Knicks to three straight wins, scoring more than 20 points in each game. But ironically his performances are missed by many in New York. That’s thanks to a dispute between Time Warner Cable and MSG Network. MSG said its ratings are up 36 per cent over its season average in the two games since Lin moved into the starting line-up. Team-mates: With Carmelo Anthony, left, lost for several weeks with a groin injury and Amar'e Stoudemire, right, on an indefinite leave after the death of his brother, the Knicks were desperate for a spark . ‘It hasn't even been a week yet,’ Lin said after his amazing performance against the Wizards. ‘I just want to make sure I do what I can to help the team win every time I step out on the floor. 'It hasn't even been a week yet. I just want to make sure I do what I can to help the team win every time I step out on the floor' Jeremy Lin . Scores of Asian-Americans at the Verizon Center cheered his every move, holding up signs, and jumping to their feet each time he sliced through the Wizards' defence on Wednesday. Since he began getting significant minutes, Lin has averaged 25.3 points and 8.3 assists. He came along at a great time for the Knicks, who are on the outside looking in at a play-off spot. With star players Carmelo Anthony lost for several weeks with a groin injury and Amar'e Stoudemire on an indefinite leave after the death of his brother, the Knicks were desperate for a spark. ‘Jeremy puts everyone in the right spots and calms us down,’ Knicks coach Mike D'Antoni said. ‘He's making things easy and the rest of the guys around him are playing the way we want to play.’ See video here .","Harvard University graduate is stunning NBA world with impressive play .

Lucky escape: Matthew Hansford, 16, pictured with his mother Alison, suffered a collapsed lung, heart damage, torn kidneys and fractured ribs . The accident happened the day day he bought the 50cc scooter, just over a week after his 16th birthday. Matthew, from Brinscall, Lancashire, said he swerved to avoid a fox. No other vehicles were involved in the accident on Blackburn Brow, Chorley, Lancashire, on November 1. After several operations and more than three weeks in a critical condition, Matthew began to improve and is now at home making a slow recovery.

Mrs Hansford said: 'At one stage we thought Matthew’s chances were very slim. But typically for him, he thought of others and before one of the operations he told me about his donor card and his wishes should the worst happen. 'The surgeon said his young age helped him survive and we’re just all so relieved that he’s improving.' Incredibly Matthew, has said he wants to return to motorcycles and join the British Legion Riders, a group who attend military funerals and repatriations.

Having lost two of her beloved horses to the Great War, schoolgirl Freda Hewlett was distraught that her pony Betty would soon be called to the front line as well. In desperation, the youngster and her brother wrote a heart-breaking letter to Lord Kitchener, pleading with the Secretary of State for War to ‘spare’ their 17-year-old mare. Signed ‘your troubled little Britishers’, the note must have touched bureaucrats in the War Office, who agreed Betty could live out her days at the family’s farm in Haigh, near Wigan. Beloved pet: A picture of Betty the pony was included in the letter sent by the two children . Pleading for mercy: In the heart-warming letter (pictured above and below) the two children beg for their beloved pony Betty to be spared from war service . Now the letter, and its reply, have been put on display as part of an exhibition at the Imperial War Museum North in Salford. The exhibition seeks to explain the facts behind Michael Morpurgo’s children’s novel War Horse, which has been made into a  movie by Steven Spielberg. In the film, farm boy Albert fails to  persuade a cavalry unit not to enlist his horse, Joey, which goes on to experience the full horrors of the trenches culminating in the Battle of the Somme. But Miss Hewlett apparently had more success by appealing directly to Whitehall. Mercy letter from Lord Kitchener: The reply from the War Office reveals the pony was spared from war service . 'Touched': Lord Kitchener - pictured here in his famous 'Wants You' poster - replied to the children, sparing their pony from the front line . Her letter, which is dated August 11, . 1914, and is addressed to ‘Dear good Lord Kitchener,’ explains that the . family have already lost two horses to the cavalry  and that they are . ‘very afraid’ of losing Betty as well. The note, which includes the farm’s . three-digit phone number ‘Wigan 515’, adds: ‘Please spare her. Daddy . says she is going to be a mother early next year and she is 17 years . old. It would break our hearts to let her go. ‘We have given two others [horses] and three of our family are now fighting for you in the Navy. ‘Mother and all will do anything for . you but do do please let us keep old Betty and send official word . quickly before anyone comes.’ A day later they received a reply from . the War Office, in which they were reassured that no horses under 15 . hands, which historians believe included Betty, would be sent to France.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:25 PM on 11th February 2012 . They were once united in common cause - and their mutual appreciation saw Donald Trump invite Alex Salmond to join him and Sean Connery to be the first to tee off at his new multimillion pound golf course. But several years later, the feel-good era between the New York property tycoon and Scotland's political leaders seems to have come to a dramatic end. Trump has launched a blistering attack on Scotland's First Minister over plans to build a 'horrendous' wind farm off the coast of his luxury Scottish golf resort. In happier times: Alex Salmond, left, poses with Donald Trump at a fashion show in New York in 2006 . In an open letter, Trump accuses Salmond of being 'hell bent on destroying Scotland's coast line and therefore Scotland itself'. The bitter words are a far cry from the love-in the two men enjoyed four years ago when Salmond backed Trump's £750 million golf development 12 miles north of Aberdeen, despite protests from environmentalists and locals about damage to rare sand dunes. Back then, Trump invited Salmond to join him and actor Sean Connery to be the first to tee off on what the businessman described as 'the world's greatest golf course'. Trump also heaped praise on Salmond's administration after it overruled local councillors who rejected the planned golf resort. The Scottish leader backed the golf course by claiming it would create hundreds of tourism jobs around the Aberdeenshire area. Locals and environmentalists campaigned in vain to save the sand dunes which were home to numerous species of wading birds and wildlife, but the dunes were bulldozed to make way for the fairways in 2009 and 2010. The course is due to open in July. The development's website said the development would span around 500 hectares of land, with a championship links golf course, a second 18-hole links golf course, a hotel surrounded by luxury holiday homes, and a residential village within the Menie Estate. Visit: Donald Trump on the Menie Estate, the site of his controversial luxury golf resort . Salmond's support for the wind farm is consistent with the Scottish government's plan to position itself as a leader in the provision and technology of renewable energy. The wind farm's turbines will be visible from the beach and the golf course. Aides to Salmond told the Herald that any suggestion Trump's intervention would influence Mr Salmond's commitment to renewables would be 'laughable'. And Niall Stuart, chief executive of Scottish Renewables, which represents the wind farm industry, reacted with anger to the intervention. 'Who is Donald Trump to tell Scotland what is good for our economy or environment?' Stuart said in a statement. 'He completely over-blows the impact of the proposed wind farm and to be honest there are so many mistakes in this ""trumped up"" nonsense that it's difficult to know where to begin.' Trump tells Salmond in the ill-tempered letter: 'With the reckless installation of these monsters, you will single-handedly have done more damage to Scotland than any event in Scottish history!' Natural beauty: Balmedie country park in Aberdeenshire. Trump said: 'When I saw this piece of land I was overwhelmed by the imposing dunes and rugged Aberdeenshire coastline' He adds: 'I will never be ""on board"", as you have stated I would be, with this insanity.' The tycoon warns Salmond that he will be using his wealth to fight his government's renewables policy. 'I have just authorized my staff to allocate a substantial amount of money to launch an international campaign to fight your plan to surround Scotland's coast with many thousands of wind turbines - it will be like looking through the bars of a prison and Scottish citizens will be like prisoners!' He ridicules the Scottish National Party's renewable energy policies, claiming the economic benefit is going to China and other countries, not Scotland. 'Jobs will not be created in Scotland because these ugly monstrosities known as turbines are manufactured in other countries such as China. 'These countries, who so benefit from your billions of pounds of payments, are laughing at you!' Trump said. Trump concludes the attack by referring to his mother, who was raised in Scotland. He adds: 'I'm doing this to save Scotland and honor my mother...'",Tycoon says his opposition to wind farm off the coast of his luxury Scottish golf resort is 'to save Scotland and honor my mother...'

"By . Lucy Laing . Last updated at 5:00 PM on 11th February 2012 . This is the heartbreaking picture of the mother who tried for a staggering 17 years to have a baby - and was a mum for just 32 days. Tracie Wright and her husband Paul, 42, had never given up trying despite nearly two decades of trying desperately to be parents. After seven years of trying naturally they underwent two courses of fertility treatment to try and help them, but the second course made Mrs Wright so ill that she ended up in hospital. Tragedy: Tracie with baby Joshua who developed a rare condition of the bowel and died suddenly in his mother's arms after 32 days . They spent the best part of a decade trying naturally again and finally fell pregnant with baby Joshua, thinking that their 17 year battle was finally over. But tragically at just 32 days old Joshua developed a rare condition of the bowel and died suddenly in his mother’s arms. Mrs Wright, from Poole in Dorset, said: ‘We had waited 17 years to have Joshua, and every moment we had was so precious with him. ‘He had been born early but he had been doing so well and we had expected to take him home with us. But we ended up bringing him home in a coffin. It was absolutely devastating.’ Tracie and her husband Paul on their wedding day. The couple tried for 17 years to conceive . The couple started trying for a baby soon after they met in the autumn of 1993. Mrs Wright had been diagnosed with polycystic ovaries at the age of 15 and doctors told her it would be almost impossible for me to have children. She said: ‘I was devastated, but I held on to a sliver of hope that one day I would be a mum. We knew there was a small chance I may fall pregnant naturally, but only a very tiny one. ‘ . By the year 2000 Mrs Wright still hadn’t fallen pregnant. So they decided to try IVF treatment to see if that would help. But that course failed, and they decided to try another time. But this time she became so ill from hyperstimulation of the ovaries that she ended up in hospital. Mrs Wright said: ‘We decided that enough was enough and we weren’t going to risk my life by trying any more fertility drugs. ‘We decided to keep hoping that I would fall pregnant naturally, but we tried to tell ourselves to face up to the fact: that we would never be parents. Then in 2006 Mrs Wright was at work as a nurse when she began to feel ill and tired. One of the doctors at work did some blood tests and they told her the most unbelievable news. She was pregnant. She said: ‘I did several tests just to make sure as I didn’t believe it. I was actually pregnant after all these years of hoping, and Paul couldn’t believe it either. ‘I went for an early scan at eight weeks and saw the baby’s heartbeat and we were just so excited. Then when I was 11 weeks pregnant I suffered a miscarriage. ‘It was heartbreakingly, gut-wrenchingly awful. I thought that this was it. I was never going to have a baby. I thought it had been the one in a million chance for me to be a mum and I had lost it.’ Amazingly, five years later, Mrs Wright fell pregnant again in February last year. At her 20 week scan doctors told her she was expecting a baby boy. Memory: Tracie and Paul are now fundraising for Poole Hospital in Dorset in memory of their son whose grave is pictured . Then just four weeks later she was diagnosed with kidney failure and her son Joshua was born at just 27 weeks, weighing a tiny 2Ib. Mrs Wright said: ‘I lay in intensive care afterwards and they brought me pictures of him. I was so proud. Doctors told us that he had such a good chance.’ Joshua had to have an operation to close a valve in his heart at a couple of days old and after a few weeks the doctors told the couple that they would be able to take him home in a couple of months. But then suddenly at 32 days old, Joshua fell ill and doctors diagnosed him with a rare condition that meant his bowel had died and it was quickly poisoning his body. Mrs Wright said: ‘It all happened so quickly. He fought so hard for six hours, but then I held him in my arms as he slipped away. ‘After 17 years of waiting for our son we had lost him after such a short time. But even though I was a mum for only 32 days, Joshua will never be forgotten and every moment with him was so precious.’ The couple are now fundraising for Poole Hospital in Joshua’s memory. Mrs Wright said: ‘The hospital was wonderful and now we want to help others in the future. And we are doing it in memory of Joshua. He brought us such joy - even though it was only for 32 days.’",Joshua developed rare bowel condition and died in his mother's arms .

British, American and German holidaymakers are queuing up to see the sickening spectacle which has arrived in the country's holiday resorts from remote villages. Scroll down for video... Brutal: Thai children as young as six are battering each other in boxing matches as entertainment for baying crowds of tourists . Battered: These young girls appear in Todd Kellstein's new movie Buffalo Girls . U.S. film-maker Todd Kellstein, whose movie Buffalo Girls is about two eight-year-old girls who take part in the 'sport', described it as 'horrific'. 'We are talking about little kids punching and kicking each other for money. The tourists watch the bouts and tip the fighters after they finish,' he told the Sun. 'Before I saw my first fight, I was in no way prepared for the brutality that takes place on a daily basis. 'These kids are small but they are tough and well-trained. The power and accuracy behind their blows is terrifying and what's really scary is they fight without any kind of headgear or protection.' Focused: Two children do battle against each other as a referee looks keenly on . Popular: British, American and German holidaymakers are queuing up to see the sickening spectacle which has arrived in the country's holiday resorts from remote villages . Los Angeles-based Kellstein attended 300 fights as part of his research, and said fighters would show 'no mercy' and keep attacking even if their opponent was knocked unconscious. His film focuses on Stam and Pet, both eight, who are also professional Muay Thai prizefighters. Set in small villages throughout rural Thailand, the film chronicles their journey as they fight in small underground arenas to win prize-money to help provide for their families. Focused: This youngster has a steely-eyed glare as she prepares to battle her opponent . Winner: Battered and bruised, this child celebrates a win in the ring . Despite the film being set in rural areas, Kellstein said the barbaric bouts also took place in tourist hotspots. He said he saw children regularly becoming concussed. And one 11-year-old was kicked so hard in the kidney he dropped to the floor like a rock. But he said he could not condemn the fights, which first started in rural villages of Thailand. He said they gave children an extra way to earn money for their families. And he added: 'In the end I decided it was not my job to judge another country's culture.'","British, American and German holidaymakers 'queue up to see sport'

"By . Gerard Couzens . Last updated at 1:38 AM on 11th February 2012 . Calling for calm: United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has urged Britain and Argentina to avoid exacerbating the row over the Falkland islands . The head of the United Nations has called on Britain and Argentina to avoid any escalation of the row over the Falkland islands. Ban Ki-Moon made the plea as Buenos Aires told the UN that Britain had turned the dispute ‘nuclear’. The claim, probably based on reports that the Royal Navy is sending a nuclear-powered submarine to the South Atlantic, shows that Argentine president Cristina Kirchner is trying to stir up international outrage. Her foreign minister, Hector Timerman, delivered his country’s official protest at Britain’s ‘militarisation’ of the seas around the Falkands to Secretary General Ban and the presidents of the Security Council and the General Assembly at the organisation’s headquarters in New York yesterday afternoon. Bob Stewart, a Tory MP who was Britain’s commander in Bosnia, said: ‘It’s got b****r all to do with the Argentinians. ‘The Falkland Islands are British and they will remain so. We are not nuclearising the South Atlantic. One of the reasons we are sending warships is because it is routine. ‘But the other reason is that we keep hearing all this rhetoric from Argentina. If they keep it up we might have to send a few more.’ Patrick Mercer, another Tory MP and a former infantry commander, said: ‘The Argentinians need to understand that the Falkland Islands belong to Her Majesty and Her Majesty will do as she pleases with her ships.’ Claims: Argentine president Cristina Kirchner has accused Britain of introducing nuclear weapons into the Falklands . Britain’s ambassador to the UN, Mark Lyall-Grant, is expected to protest to the international body about the behaviour of the Kirchner government, and to point out that the deployment of warships and Prince William is entirely ‘routine’ and has ‘nothing to do with escalating our military posture’. He will point out that the UN committee to which Argentina has complained is the same body that enshrines the right of self-determination in international law – the very principle that justifies Britain’s ownership of the islands. Argentina claims Britain has violated around 40 UN resolutions which call for dialogue with Argentina to 'peacefully resolve the conflict initiated in 1833 with the military invasion of the Falkland Islands'. Mr Timerman later met UN delegates from Colombia and Guatemala, both temporary members of the Security Council, in a bid to play on Latin American solidarity in support of Argentina’s claim. The Argentine mission came only a day after Mrs Kirchner attacked Britain’s decision to send the Duke of Cambridge and one of its most modern destroyers to the Falklands region. Speaking from her official home in Buenos Aires, she said Mr Timerman would making a 'presentation to the United Nations on the militarization and also the introduction of nuclear weapons in the area around the Falklands'. Angry: Penguin News has enraged Argentina by calling its leader a 'bitch' on its website, by using the insult as a file name on a photograph of her . Chileans . living in the Falklands have protested over fears Argentina will . pressure its neighbour into axing their only air link with their . homeland. They waved . Union Jacks and Chilean flags as they urged Chile president Sebastian . Pinera to resist any moves to suspend the weekly flight between the . capital Santiago and the Falklands. The LAN flight uses Argentina's airspace and makes a stop-off in the Argentine city of Rio Gallegos. Buenos . Aires has insisted it has no intention of scuppering the flight but its . claims have failed to calm the fears of the hundreds of south Americans . living in the Falklands. Chile was a key ally of Britain during the 1982 Falklands War but has since switched its allegiance to Argentina. Protest spokesman Antoine Daille, said: 'We are upset with Chile because Pinera supported Argentina. We feel hurt. 'All . the Chileans living here are upset with him because he forgot us. We . don't support the Argentines, we support the people of the Falkland . Islands.' Argentine newspapers quickly picked up on her claims about nuclear weapons without challenging them. But there was also speculation that she may, either intentionally or by mistake, have made a 'slip of the tongue'. The Royal Navy has reportedly sent a submarine to the Falklands, believed to be either HMS Tireless or HMS Turbulent. Both are powered by nuclear reactors but it is unlikely they are carrying nuclear warheads. With little success, Mrs Kirchner has been trying for year to drum up pressure on the UN that might force Britain to sit down for talks on the Falklands’ future. Echoing the stance of previous prime ministers, David Cameron has said sovereignty will only ever be decided by the islanders, who remain wholeheartedly determined to live under the British flag. With her continual resurrection of Argentina’s emotive claim to Las Malvinas, Mrs Kirchner has become the bête noire of Falklands islanders. In an apparent accidental slip-up that prompted protests from hundreds of Argentines, the website of the Penguin News – the local Falklands newspaper – this week ran a photo of Mrs Kirchner which it titled 'bitch'.

"By . Ted Thornhill . Last updated at 11:27 AM on 7th February 2012 . Proof that the ‘Hill of Jonah’ – or Giv’at Yonah’ - was occupied at the time the prophet is said to have existed has been uncovered by archaeologists. It is thought that he was buried at the coastal site in Ashdod, Israel, and now the foundation of an ancient fortress with one-metre-wide walls has been exposed in an excavation there by the Israel Antiquities Authority, which dates the remains to the First Temple period - 850 to 586 BC. It verifies the existence of life there during the time of the eighth-century prophet, who according to Jewish, Christian and Muslim scriptures, defied God and spent three nights in the belly of a fish or whale as punishment before being released. Evidence: The remains of the fortress indicate that there was life on the Hill of Jonah at the time he was said to have existed . Sa'ar Ganor, the Ashkelon District Archaeologist of the Israel Antiquities Authority, said: ‘Giv'at Yonah, which rises 50 metres above sea level, is the highest hill in Ashdod, whence one can look out to sea, to Tel Mor – located in the Nahal Lachish estuary which was probably an ancient anchorage, and to Tel Ashdod. ‘Due to its strategic location, it is not surprising to find the remains of a fortress that overlooked the region in the First Temple period.’ He adds: ‘There are two possibilities regarding who inhabited the fortress at that time: one possibility is that it was controlled by the Assyrians who were the regional rulers in the Iron Age. Another possibility is that Josiah, king of Judah, occupied the fort at the time, who we know conquered territory from the Assyrians and controlled Ashdod-Yam in the seventh century BC.’ Punishment: Fresco painting of Jonah and the Whale by an unknown 15th-century artist . The discovery of this fortress joins other finds from an excavation that took place very close to the site in the 1960s. In an excavation carried out before the construction of the modern Ashdod lighthouse, similar wall remains were found that date to the First Temple period and Persian period (539 to 334 BC). Here an Aramaic phrase was found indicating that an individual named Ba'altzad contributed a sum of money that was given as a donation for a holy place.",Jonah is said to have been trapped in the belly of a whale for three days .
"By . Michael O'farrell . Last updated at 2:34 AM on 12th February 2012 . To generations of Irish people, the name Haughey has been synonymous with controversial and scandalous money matters thanks to the notorious financial affairs of family patriarch and former taoiseach Charles Haughey. But today, the Irish Mail on Sunday can reveal a new chapter in the family saga as we disclose that a multimillion-euro loan related to the helicopter business of his son, Ciarán, has been taken over by NAMA. The ex-taoiseach may have been able to have his own bank debts quietly swept under the carpet for much of his indulged and corrupt life but the company set up by his son – which was used to funnel €600,000 to his father – has now landed the family name in the ‘toxic bank’. Lift-off: Ciarán Haughey in one of his helicopters . The loan in question is related to Medeva Properties Ltd, a firm jointly owned by Ciarán Haughey and John Barnicle, a Vietnam War helicopter pilot. Now though, in an unfortunate twist of fate, his business dealings with Mr Haughey have crashed to earth. Medeva has close connections to Celtic Helicopters, which was set up by Mr Haughey in 1985 and has featured extensively in various tribunal inquiries into payments to his father. Mr Haughey and Mr Barnicle are fellow directors of both firms and Celtic Helicopters is part-owned by Medeva. Other shareholders in Celtic Helicopters include Larchfield Securities – the Haughey family firm that controls assets such as the island of Inishvickillaune off the Kerry coast as well as seaside properties in Co. Wexford. The MoS has discovered that ­Medeva’s NAMA loan is a €3m Irish Nationwide advance secured against the land and aircraft hangers at the Celtic Helicopters headquarters in Knocksedan near Dublin Airport. Only the largest of the 850 property developers whose loans have been taken over by NAMA are directly managed by the agency itself. The Knocksedan heliport is the only property registered to Medeva and land registry documents reveal several back-to-back Irish Nationwide loans secured against the asset. The first Irish Nationwide loan is dated February 1996, when Medeva bought the land from Celtic Helicopters with the intention of renting the hangers and facilities out. But the initial loan is followed by seven further advances from Irish Nationwide, which increased in frequency between 2000 and 2008. In all, company documents reveal that Medeva has seven outstanding mortgages with Irish Nationwide, many of them for helicopters. Wedding: Ciarán Haughey married Laura Daly 20 years ago, to the delight of his father CJ, right . The latest accounts for Medeva, filed to the Company Registrations Office just this week, reveal that the company had a bank loan of €3.1m in 2011, the balance of which had increased by more than €100,000 from the previous year rather than being reduced by repayments. Meanwhile, the accounts value the company’s property asset at less than €2m. When approached by the MoS at his Malahide home this week, Mr Barnicle admitted that the debt had been taken over by NAMA. Mr Barnicle said: ‘That’s because the whole bank was taken in. Either you had a loan or you didn’t. If you were in Irish Nationwide, regardless of if you were making repayments or not, NAMA had it.’ However, when he was asked if the company had defaulted or missed payments on the loan, meaning it could face enforcement by NAMA, he admitted that it had. Asked whether Medeva was still in default and would be able to pay the loan back, Mr Barnicle said it depended on how things went. When asked how things were going for Medeva, he replied: ‘Same as ­everything else in the country at the moment.’ He has gone from being a swashbuckling US army helicopter pilot to the late Charlie Haughey’s trusted helper – the pilot who discreetly flew Haughey’s lover, Terry Keane, pictured above right, to romantic rendezvous on his Blasket island of Inishvickillaune. Then, as a business partner of the former taoiseach’s son, Ciarán, John Terence Barnicle found himself being questioned by two tribunals before winding up in NAMA. Now 67 and living in a modest home in Malahide, he is thought to have been born to Irish parents in Chicago before qualifying as a helicopter pilot and serving his time in Vietnam. According to the Vietnam ­Helicopter Pilots Association he served with the 129th Assault Helicopter Company – a unit that distinguished itself with several valour and merit awards as it served throughout the war. In Ireland, Barnicle is still renowned as a daring flyer who gave many a pilot their first start as Celtic Helicopters provided work for new graduates. Some still recall his habit of doubling forward to light his cigarettes with the same hand that controlled the chopper so as not to have his hands leave the controls. As the founding pilot of Celtic Helicopters, he flew with many famous names, including Ben Dunne. The situation at Celtic Helicopters appears no better. The company has failed to file accounts for more than a year and Mr Haughey and Barnicle have received enforcement warnings from the Company Registrations Office. A spokesman for the CRO said: ‘They have had notices from our enforcement section and they are following up on that at the moment. They are open to prosecution and strike-off if they don’t file.’ Celtic Helicopters did attempt to file an annual return on January 26 but that was sent back as it was deemed to be not in order. The MoS made several attempts to speak to Mr Haughey about the NAMA loan and other matters at his palatial home in Kinsealy, Co. Dublin, and his place of work, as well as through emails and phone messages to colleagues at Celtic Helicopters. He did not respond to any of these approaches. Mr Haughey’s journey into NAMA is merely the latest twist in a ­frequently controversial business career dominated and over-­shadowed from the very beginning by his late father. During the recession of the Eighties, it was joked that the best way to get a job was to be the taoiseach’s son. In 1985 when, at the age of 25, Ciarán Haughey wanted to establish Celtic Helicopters, it was his father’s bagman, Des Traynor, who stepped up to the mark to help him out. The result was that the first two loans the company received came from Guinness & Mahon Ltd and Ansbacher Ltd, which would ­feature endlessly as the McCracken and Moriarty Tribunals investigated payments to Charles Haughey. The initial capital for Celtic Helicopters was a combination of £80,000 collected by Des Traynor, who ran the Guinness & Mahon private bank, and a loan from Guinness & Mahon itself. Some £50,000 of this was found to have been transferred through the now ­notorious Cayman Islands Ans­bacher account. When the company found itself in dire financial straits in the early Nineties, a further £290,000 was raised by Mr Traynor. This money was contributed by a number of businessmen, including Xavier McAuliffe, a Fianna Fáil supporter who two years ago was awarded the lucrative contract to roll out speed detector vans across the country. The tribunals would also uncover other instances of businessmen going out of their way to help in order to keep on good terms with Charles Haughey. For example, Mike Murphy, of Mike Murphy Insurance Brokers, organised a loan to help Celtic Helicopters pay for the insurance he was providing – then proceeded to pay off the loan himself. The Moriarty Tribunal found that Mr Murphy’s actions had been motivated by his ‘desire not to fall foul of what was perceived to be Mr Haughey’s enormous power’. It added: ‘The payment was on the face of it the straightforward discharge of a debt owed by a company, Celtic Helicopters, associated with Mr Haughey. ‘Mr Murphy emphasised that he did not want to have made an enemy of the son of the most powerful man in the State; that the risk to which his own business might be exposed in the event of Mr Haughey’s son’s business failing.’ In all, Charles Haughey was found to have received indirect payments of more then £600,000 through his son’s helicopter company. The tribunal also found that Charles Haughey ‘had used Celtic Helicopters as a vehicle for the transmission of other funds, in themselves unrelated to Celtic ­Helicopters, so as to enable them to be applied to his own use, while removing traces of the identity of the providers of the funds’. There would be other skirmishes between Ciarán Haughey and the tribunals. Holiday: CJ Haughhey and Terry Keane were flown by John Barnicle . In 2006, the Mahon Tribunal criticised him and Mr Barnicle for failing to tell the inquiry that a significant amount of the proceeds from the sale of a share in a land holding near Dublin Airport had been transferred to the Isle of Man. A lot of money had been spent ‘wandering around the globe trying to work out where the money had gone’, complained tribunal chairman Alan Mahon when Haughey Jr and Barnicle retracted evidence. The pair had originally told the tribunal that the proceeds for the sale of the lands owned by a consortium called Cargobridge, which the tribunal was investigating, had gone to Ben Dunne. But they later changed their evidence and conceded that Medeva had received, via an Isle of Man account, most of the proceeds. That same year, Celtic Helicopters made a settlement of almost €700,000 with the Revenue ­Commissioners. The payment was made after it emerged the company had under declared its VAT when it was audited by the Revenue. Celtic Helicopters was found to owe tax of €333,989 and had to pay interest and penalties of €355,956. The total settlement was €689,945. But despite mounting debts at his companies and the pressure of paying off tax settlements, Mr Haughey showed no outward signs of financial stress in recent years. In 2007, he applied for planning permission to Fingal County Council to renovate and extend his home extensively, adding a new recreation room, conservatory and three-car garage. That same year, on September 13, he bought a Fifth Avenue apartment in New York. Documents obtained by the MoS reveal Mr Haughey used a $765,000 (€580,000) Anglo Irish Bank loan to buy the $969,000 property. The one-bedroom apartment in the Grand Madison building is now worth $765,000.","In his early days, Ciarán Haughey’s business woes were eclipsed by his father’s scandals.

Army specialist Jeremy Gilley, 27, of Palermo, Maine, watched in agony as his legs were crushed by a minivan in Augusta, Maine, two months ago. He had pulled over to help another driver, but a 16-year-old on the road didn’t see the accident and struck the driver’s pickup truck and Mr Gilley. Iraq veteran: Jeremy Gilley, 27, of Palermo, Maine (pictured with girlfriend Rachael Turcotte), saw his legs crushed by a minivan in Augusta, Maine . ‘I looked down,’ Mr Gilley told the Morning Sentinel. ‘I knew it wasn't going to be good.

"By . Graham Smith . Last updated at 9:06 AM on 13th February 2012 . Employees in New Hampshire could soon be banned from wearing fragrances or scented products. State workers who interact with the public as part of their job will have to go to work au naturel if a proposed law is passed this week. House Bill 1444 has been proposed by Republican Michele Peckham to protect people with asthma or other allergies. Kicking up a stink: Public-facing employees in New Hampshire could soon be banned from wearing fragrances or scented products . Exposure to perfume can trigger nasal congestion, a bout of sneezing and a runny nose. 'It may seem silly, but it’s a health issue,' Mrs Peckham told the New Hampshire Union Leader. 'Many people have violent reactions to strong scents.' The bill will come into effect within 60 days if is approved by the New Hampshire House Of Representatives on Wednesday. It remains unclear how the proposed legislation would be enforced. The Constitutional Review and Statutory Recodification Committee, however, is recommending the House kill the bill as a possible constitutional conflict between rights of the individual employee and the health effects on an occasional customer with an allergy to scented products. Up to one in 20 people suffer from a perfume allergy and it is a common cause of sinus problems, as well as other symptoms ranging from skin rashes and shortness of breath to nausea and dizziness. The chemical irritant in the scent penetrates the delicate tissue lining the sinuses and triggers swelling. It is quite rare, however, to be allergic to an entire perfume - usually it's an individual component that causes the allergy. This can be quite hard to pin down, as fragrances are blends of different chemicals and sometimes also include natural ingredients. Dr Stanley Caress, an environmental studies professor at the University of West Georgia, told MyHealthNewsDaily.com: 'People who have asthma, a large number of them are chemically sensitive, and therefore find fragrant products irritating. 'Most commercial perfume products, even air fresheners, have chemical make-ups and therefore are potential irritants.'",Public workers in New Hampshire will be unable to wear fragrances at work if proposed law is passed .

When the residents of a small village heard a huge static caravan was being transported to an illegal travellers’ site, they expected the police to take immediate action. What they didn’t expect were notices saying their cars would be towed away if they didn’t move them as the caravan was given a police escort through their main street. ‘Any vehicle that is obstructing this movement will be towed away at the owner’s expense,’ the signs warned car owners in South Harting, West Sussex. Left a bit: A motorbike and a Land Rover from Sussex Police accompanied the 15-foot wide load to a field which has already been declared as illegal . Coming through! Residents in South Harting, in West Sussex were at risk of having their vehicles towed away by police if they didn't remove them from one of the two main village streets . The 15ft by 40ft caravan – thought to have cost up to £20,000 and to have two bedrooms – was being delivered to a site which has been ruled illegal, but is subject to a planning appeal. As it slowly lumbered through the village yesterday, struggling to negotiate narrow bends and pulled by a lorry and escorted by two police vehicles, residents stood and watched in disbelief. David Barnard, chairman of the parish council, said: ‘If they are not allowed there, isn’t now the time to stop another vehicle going on the site, instead of helping it? The concern is once there is  permission for two caravans, suddenly there will be 22.’ The extra wide load - described by police as a 'caravan', by planners as 'a mobile home' - is so wide it could not come down a direct route from the main east-west A 272 road through West Sussex . Push! Travellers help move the mobile home into place at the 'illegal' site near South Harting, West Sussex leaving villagers angry as they were ordered to move their cars . Grand entrance: The huge static caravan is accompanied on the site by two abnormal load vehicles . Joe Newton, 47, a builder, said: ‘It is an illegal site and the whole thing is incredibly hypocritical. It is opening the floodgates to something far bigger than a couple of mobile homes.’ Two caravans have occupied Three-Cornered Piece, a mile away from South Harting, a beauty spot in the South Downs National Park, since 2009 after travellers bought the five-acre site and moved in on a Bank Holiday weekend. A traveller said yesterday: ‘They might as well get used to it because we’re going to be there for a long time.’ Notices were placed on villagers' car . windscreens two days ago reading: 'Will owners of vehicles please make . sure that there (sic) vehicles are removed from these roads until after . the abnormal load has passed, which should hopefully be by 2pm Friday'. The mobile home is pictured squeezing past a historic pub, with police in tow . Two concrete bases for caravans have been laid at the camp. The travellers have made a retrospective planning application for them and a septic tank, but it has yet to be considered by council planners.The caravan is so wide it could not come down a direct route from the main east-west route through West Sussex. It was escorted by police from Petersfield, five miles away, through South Harting’s village square. A mother of two, who asked not to be named, said: ‘It is absolutely outrageous. I live in a Grade II-listed house with leaking windows that needs rewiring and new plumbing, but when I applied for planning permission it was refused. I’ve got two children and no central heating but these guys can just move in. It is bang out of order.’ Neil Simpson, 50, said: ‘When I had a little touring caravan the council came down on me like ton of bricks. They told me to take it away so I did, because that’s what people like us have to do. There are perhaps two laws being applied.’ Wide load: Local residents look on as the 40ft long mobile home is transported through the village of South Harting in the snowy weather . Official response: A Chichester District Council spokesman said they understood residents' concerns about the delivery of the caravan, adding that a planing stop notice will prevent more than two mobile homes being erected on the land . A Chichester District Council spokesman said they understood residents’ concerns about the delivery of the caravan, adding: ‘We have taken action in a number of different ways. ‘There is a planning stop notice which prohibits more than two mobile homes and any engineering work on the land. We understand one of the mobile homes has been removed. ‘We have also served an enforcement notice requiring the removal of the mobile homes from the land, which the owners appealed against. This is now the subject of a High Court challenge.’ A police spokesman said: ‘We recognise the local sensitivities around this issue. We are playing a minor role in the event.’ Troubled times: A map showing the village and . the site, and the village square in South Harting, where residents have . been told they must move their vehicles to make way for the large mobile . home .","Officers with Land Rover and squad car escorted 'abnormally large' wide load vehicle to site .

Nasa has said a six-ton satellite doomed to fall to Earth this week will not hit the U.S. as incredible video was captured showing the start of the spacecraft's descent. Scientists today said that the Upper Atmospheric Research Satellite (UARS) will make its final fiery plunge on Friday afternoon when it is not due to be passing over North America. Americans had been warned that the 20-year-old bus sized satellite could cause injuries and damage to property as it falls through the atmosphere and drops about two dozen pieces of debris on to Earth weighting up to 300lbs. Scroll down for video . Tumbling to Earth: Images from Mr Legault's video show the 20-year-old Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS), appearing as a beaming mass of light . Danger: The six-ton Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite will crash to Earth and could land in Britain . The latest predictions of the . satellites re-entry mean that the U.S. will miss out on the stunning . sight of the spacecraft as it re-enters the atmosphere. A Nasa spokesman said: 'Re-entry is expected sometime during the afternoon of Sept 23, Eastern . Daylight Time. 'The satellite will not be passing over North America . during that time period. 'It is still too early to predict the time and . location of re-entry with any more certainty, but predictions will . become more refined in the next 24 to 36 hours.# . The predictions came as a astrophotographer in northern France captured video of the satellite. Thierry Legault's clip shows the spacecraft appearing as a beaming mass of light as it plummets to Earth. Best guess: The satellite could fall anywhere between the two latitudes, where billions of people live . Mr Legault's footage of UARS was . captured through the lens of his Celestron EdgeHD 14in . Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope in Dunkerque, France on September 15 - . eight to nine days before its estimated re-entry. Filmed at an altitude of only 250km, the body of the UARS is visible, as are its solar arrays. Mr Legault told the skywatching . website Spaceweather.com: 'The satellite appears to be tumbling, perhaps . because a collision with satellite debris a few years ago. The . variations in brightness are rapid and easily visible to the human eye.' The Upper Atmosphere Research . Satellite, or UARS, ran out of fuel in 2005. NASA says it will point between 57 degrees . north and 57 degrees south. Most of the satellite will burn up . during re-entry, but a 1,200 pounds of metal metal will still plummet to . the Earth’s surface. Astrophotographer: Thierry Legault captured the incredible footage in Dunkerque, France on his Celestron EdgeHD 14in Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope . Astronomer Dr Ian Griffin, from the UK Association of Science and Discovery Centres, says the Earth's atmosphere slows down falling satellites a great deal. He explained that what remains of UARS will hit the ground relatively slowly and 'certainly not at orbital velocity of 17,500mph'. Much of any satellite crashing to Earth will be disintegrated by heat, caused by friction with the atmosphere. It's the reason we get shooting stars - created by meteors burning up in the upper atmosphere. UARS is large enough, though, that up over a ton will strike the ground. It will not be in one piece, however:  space vehicles experience incredible stress on re-entry. The load can be as much as 10Gs. An F1 car experiences around 5Gs with maximum braking from high speed. The reason why the location of the crash site is so hard to predict is because the density of the atmosphere varies so greatly higher up, producing different amounts of drag. A prediction that was wrong by even a few minutes would mean the satellite landing a huge distance away, owing to its speed. It’s . being tracked by the Joint Space Operations Center of U.S. Strategic . Command at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. A Nasa spokesman pointed out that there has yet to be any reported injury from falling space debris. He said: ‘The risk to public safety or property is extremely small, and safety is NASA's top priority. Since the beginning of the Space Age in the late-1950s, there have been no confirmed reports of an injury resulting from re-entering space objects. This satellite is far smaller than . the 135-ton Russian space station Mir, which fell to Earth in 2001 or . the 100-ton Skylab that fell in 1979. So far this year alone, two large Russian rocket stages have fallen to earth without inflicting any injury. Mir . fell into the South Pacific, while Skylab hit the Indian Ocean and . parts of sparsely populated western Australia. Because two-thirds of the . Earth is ocean, space debris usually hits water. Nasa is urging anyone who finds a piece of the UARS satellite not to touch it. The . spokesman added: ‘If you find something you think may be a piece of . UARS, do not touch it. Contact a local law enforcement official for . assistance.’ It was launched . back in 1991 by the Space Shuttle Discovery to measure ozone levels, . wind speeds and temperatures in the stratosphere. Junk yard in space: UARS is one of the thousands of objects in Earth orbit being tracked by Nasa, as shown by this computer graphic . But now it’s one of 370,000 pieces of junk floating in space at speeds of up to 22,000mph. The volume of debris was greatly increased by a 2007 Chinese anti-satellite weapon test and a 2009 crash-in-orbit of two satellites. The widely criticised Chinese test used a missile to smash an ageing weather satellite into 150,000 pieces of 1cm debris and 3,118 pieces can be tracked by radar on the ground. The UARS is something of a relic - these days, Nasa satellites are designed to be light enough to burn up on re-entry, or to have fuel to fly up into a higher, longer-term orbit.

Sir Simon Jenkins dismissed wind as the ‘least efficient’ renewable power. The honest admission is surprising coming from the the head of the charity, as it champions green energy as part of its conservation work. ‘We are doing masses of renewables but wind is probably the least efficient and wrecks the countryside,’ he said. The National Trust is concerned about the impact of 220m (721ft) turbines on the environment and on views of the Bristol Channel . ‘Broadly speaking, the National Trust is deeply sceptical of this form of renewable energy.’ While the National Trust officially continues to support ‘a major increase in the UK’s renewable energy generation’, it is fighting several plans for wind farms, including one to erect a massive 417 wind turbines in the Bristol Channel. The trust is concerned about the impact of the 220m (721ft) turbines on the environment and on views of the coastline. Ed Davey boasted that Britain had 'a lot to be proud of' after the world's biggest offshore farm opened . It is also disputing the Duke of Gloucester’s plans to build four 415ft turbines on his Barnwell Manor Estate in Northamptonshire. The trust remains committed to its target to cut energy use by 50 per cent by 2020, but Sir Simon told the Daily Telegraph this would largely be achieved through water power and biomass boilers, making the most of the acres of rivers and woodlands under its ownership. The revelation could be a major a blow to the Coalition government, which has recently come to blows with the Trust over plans to reform planning law. Last week Ed Davey, who replaced Chris Huhne as Energy and Climate Change secretary, boasted that Britain had ‘a lot to be proud of’ after the world’s biggest offshore farm – consisting of 102 turbines - opened off the Cumbrian coast. Up to 32,000 wind turbines could be built in England and Wales over the next 40 years to meet government targets. But last month it emerged that wind farms in Scotland were paid nearly £300,000 in the first five days of this year to close down because it was too windy. Four turbine operators shared the controversial ‘constraint payments’ because they produced more energy than the National Grid could handle. Last year 17 wind farm operators were paid £7m to shut down on 40 occasions between January and September.",Trust says it will cuts its energy use with water power and biomass boilers .

Rachel Sanderson, had been battling terminal cancer for a number of years but was determined to marry her partner, Glen. Three days before she passed away, Rachel and Glen said their vows in front of close family and friends at an emotional ceremony in Ward 35 at Newcastle's Freeman Hospital. Special day: Rachel Sanderson with her husband Glen on their wedding day in Newcastle's Freeman Hospital, where she was battling a rare form of cancer . Celebration: Rachel and Glen get married at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle . Mrs Sanderson who lived in East Boldon, South Tyneside, decided on the morning of January 25 that she wanted to get married. By 3pm that day her hospital room had been transformed with banners, bows and balloons and her wedding ceremony took place with her lying in her bed. Rachel, who would have been 33 today, had been with Glen, 35, for five and a half years. In 2002, she began to feel a tingling sensation in her fingers and severe pain in her left shoulder. Ultrasound scans and x-rays came back clear so Rachel put up with the aching joints. Mother's love: Sylvia said: 'I have so much admiration for my daughter' It was not until the summer of 2009, . when a lump developed on Rachel's shoulder showed that she had synovial . sarcoma, a rare form of cancer. The tumour was the size of a large coffee mug and Rachel faced the prospect of having her left shoulder and arm amputated. She . chose to go through gruelling sessions of chemotherapy and radiotherapy . instead, surgeons operated on the tumour but the cancer spread to her . lungs and to her brain. In August 2010 she was told the devastating news that her condition was terminal. Mother Sylvia Howey, 64, said: 'The news was devastating. Rachel had always been determined to beat the cancer but unfortunately she was unable to.' In the early hours of January 28, Rachel died peacefully in hospital in her mother's arms. Sylvia, a retired secretary from Heaton, Newcastle, has now paid tribute to her only child. She said: 'I am so proud to have had Rachel as my daughter and her death has left a huge void in my life. 'She was my world and I could not have wished for a more caring daughter - she always thought of others before herself and was non-judgmental. 'Rachel was a stunningly beautiful woman, both inside and out, she touched the heart of everyone. 'Her bubbly personality shone like a beacon and she lit a room when she entered it. 'She was an intelligent, witty, courageous, tenacious, inspirational, caring and loving young woman. 'I am desperately sad that she did not see her birthday and it is hard to put into words how life will be without her.' Rachel before her diagnosis: Her mother said she 'shone like a beacon.' She died this January. Rachel worked in various hair salons in North Tyneside and Newcastle. She had secured a new hairdressing job but the diagnosis of her illness meant she never started her new role. Last year she was made a Freeman of the City of Newcastle upon Tyne. Her mother said: 'I have so much admiration for my daughter. She decided that she would be the happiest patient on Ward 35 in the Freeman cancer unit. 'And she certainly achieved that, constantly smiling through all she endured over many years of pain and disappointment. 'She remained positive throughout and kept thinking of everyone else. 'Rachel said she was not ready to say goodbye and worried about what would happen to me, Glen and her best friend Matthew. 'No parent ever expects to go before their child and it has been a difficult time. 'But I know Rachel is now at peace.'

"Statue set to cost £70,000 and will be unveiled in the French suburb of Nogent-sur-Marne . By . Peter Allen . Last updated at 7:25 PM on 13th February 2012 . The statue of Bruni is set to cost £70,000 . A plan to erect a life-size and taxpayer-funded bronze statue of French First Lady Carla Bruni in a Paris suburb has caused outrage. Jacques Martin, the conservative mayor of Nogent-sur-Marne, east of the French capital, has approved the new artwork, which will be inaugurated in May. The £70,000 statue will not only ‘celebrate’ the looks of the multi-millionaire heiress and former supermodel, but portray her as local factory worker. By being immortalised in bronze, Ms Bruni will follow in the footsteps of Gallic legends including Joan of Arc and General Charles de Gaulle. ‘It’s an absolute joke,’ said Karim Haddad, a 19-year-old student from Nogent. ‘Carla represents big money privilege – she has nothing in common with ordinary people at all. ‘The only reason the mayor wants this statue put up is to impress the President. It’s pathetic.’ Ms Bruni, who retains her maiden name in her career as a pop singer, became President Nicolas Sarkozy’s third wife following a whirlwind romance in 2008. The 44-year-old has since built up a reputation as one of France’s most pampered and high-spending first ladies, and is often referred to as ‘Marie Antoinette’, after the spoilt French queen who was eventually guillotined. Yet Mr Martin, who belongs to Mr Sarkozy’s ruling UMP coalition, believes that an image of the Turin-born heiress will bring a ‘little piece of Italy’ to Nogent. The commuter town has a large Italian community among its 30,000 residents, and Mr Martin believes that many will be impressed by the six feet plus statue. It is currently being created in secret by Elisabeth Cibot, an artist who is one of Ms Bruni’s favourite. Artist Elisabeth Cibot, who previously worked on a statue  of the late Polish pope Jean-Paul II, pictured, will depict the French First Lady in working clothes . Ms Bruni will be depicted in working clothes as a tribute to the ‘plumassieres’ – women who worked local feather factories. But William Geib, a local Socialist MP, said: ‘It’s sad for the women who have worked in this industry. Referring to Ms Bruni’s modeling days, Mr Geib added: ‘Carla Bruni must have seen more feathers on ostriches and on catwalks than in factories!’ And Marc Arias, a Nogent councillor, said the fact that the statue was being modelled on Ms Bruni was a ‘a small detail which was specified during the budget vote.’ A spokeswoman for Ms Bruni  said she ‘receives numerous artistic requests’ but did not view herself as ‘Joan of Arc or General de Gaulle.’ She confirmed that Ms Bruni had met Elisabeth Cabot, whose last major work was a giant statue of Pope Jean-Paul II, and authorised her to use her face in the Nogent work. Ms Bruni is currently at the centre of a charity funding scandal, in which she has been accused of funneling Aids funds to close friends from the music industry in Paris. Her husband, Mr Sarkozy, is widely expected to lose presidential elections due this April/May, meaning she will no longer be the first lady.","Statue set to cost £70,000 and will be unveiled in the French suburb of Nogent-sur-Marne ."
"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 11:37 PM on 13th February 2012 . A paedophile firearms officer raped an eight-year-old girl and carried out violent attacks on a series of former girlfriends. Jonathan White, 41, who worked for South Yorkshire Police,was a firearms support officer who helped provide round-the-clock armed cover. But the officer carried out sex attacks on a young girl over a two-year period when she was aged between eight and 10. Jailed: Jonathan White, 41, was given 12 years behind bars at Nottingham Crown Court . He was jailed for 12 years after a jury at Nottingham Crown Court found him guilty of two counts of rape, two charges of sexual assault and two allegations of inciting sexual activity with the young victim. He was also put on the sex offenders' register for life and banned from working with children. The latest convictions add to his earlier shameful and cowardly attacks on women. He resigned from South Yorkshire Police in November 2009 after eight years with the force when he was convicted of attacking a former girlfriend. He was later jailed in 2010 for assaulting another partner. Other former girlfriends have reported that, while he was a 'smooth charmer' at the start of their relationships, he would then turn violent. One ex-partner, who planned to marry White before his arrest over child sex abuse claims, said he told her he had gone to Afghanistan to work as a private security contractor - when in fact he was in jail for domestic violence. 'He was incredibly manipulative,' she said. Police also investigated claims White sexually abused a six-year-old girl but the case did not go to court due to concerns about putting the youngster through the ordeal when officers already had a strong case against White. The 16-year-old victim's grandmother said: 'It is incredible to think this was an officer who had the right to carry a gun.' Detective Constable Lisa Saporita, of Nottinghamshire's child abuse investigation unit, said: 'White's victim has shown incredible strength and bravery.'","Jonathan White, 41, jailed for 12 years for raping the girl over a two-year period ."

This is the bizarre and distinctive prison issue clothing worn by murder suspect John Anslow on the day he escaped from a prison van last month. Anslow, 31, was wearing the bright blue and yellow pyjama-style clothing when he escaped from a prison van near HMP Hewell Grange near Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, on January 23. The murder suspect was sprung from the van during an ambush by masked raiders who smashed the prison van's windscreen with sledgehammers before speeding away in a silver VW vehicle. On the run: Murder suspect John Anslow was wearing this distinctive blue and yellow outfit (right) when he escaped from a prison van near HMP Hewell Grange, Worcestershire . As part of the hunt for the prisoner, detectives have released the image of the distinctive outfit worn by Anslow in the hope more witnesses will come forward. It is thought the prisoner might have discarded the bright prison suit on or since his escape. Anslow, who had been en route to Stafford Crown Court when he escaped the prison van on January 23, is classed as a 'Category A' prisoner. This is reserved for those prisoners whose escape would be highly dangerous to the public, police or security, and for whom the aim is to make escape impossible. Police also revealed more information today about the vehicles used in his escape and the route they took. A grey Mercedes C63 AMG Estate was a second car used by the offenders. A silver VW Scirocco, registration BT59 NXC, was used before they abandoned it and switched to the Mercedes. Police said the Mercedes travelled north along the B4096 Hewell Lane on to Alcester Road to the M42 Junction 1 island. Getaway vehicle: A grey Mercedes estate car similar to this one was used to transport the gang away from the prison van ambush last month . It then went on to the B4096, on the Old Birmingham Road towards the Lickey Hills, travelled down Rose Hill and turned left into Lickey Road in Cofton Hackett. A £10,000 reward has been offered for information about Anslow, from Tipton, that leads to his arrest and return to prison. Anslow was one of five men charged with the murder of businessman Richard Deakin in Chasetown, Staffordshire, in July 2010. Searches have been carried out by police in the Tipton area following Anslow’s escape but he remains at large. A 44-year-old man arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender following the escape remains on police bail. Police have said they consider Anslow to be very dangerous and have warned anyone who sees him to not approach him and to contact them immediately. Police block the roads leading to Hewell Grange Prison in Redditch, after the prisoner's escape . Ambushed: The masked men smashed the windscreen of the GEO Amey escort vehicle before threatening the driver with a knife . Detective Superintendent Wayne Jones, from Staffordshire Police, said: 'We’re determined to catch Anslow and a dedicated team of detectives are following several lines of inquiry. 'A substantial reward of £10,000 remains on offer for anyone who can give us information that leads to Anslow’s arrest and return to prison. 'We’ve had over 100 calls from across the country so far and are continuing to liaise with other forces and agencies nationwide. Our officers are working closely with colleagues at West Mercia and West Midlands police forces. Wanted man: Anslow poses with a dolphin for a family picture. Police have warned members of the public not to approach him . Manhunt: Anslow escaped in a silver Volkswagen Scirocco before transferring to a silver Mercedes . 'We’re particularly keen to speak to anyone who saw the Mercedes on Monday January 23 or any suspicious activity in the areas surrounding the prison during the weekend before. 'We also need to talk to people who may have seen Anslow in the distinctive prison suit - or the discarded suit itself after the incident.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:51 PM on 21st October 2011 . No love for familiarity: Judge John Foster has been accused of discrimination . To most in the county, it is a term of endearment. But one Yorkshire judge takes such offence at the use of the word 'love' as a term of address, he has banned it from his courtroom. Barnsley Magistrates' Court Judge John Foster has ruled that defendants should no longer be permitted to reply 'yes, love' when confirming their details with the court clerk or legal adviser. Instead, they have been ordered to answer: 'Yes, ma'am.' Judge Foster claims the word 'love' is 'disrespectful' and has ordered all defendants in his court to abide by the new rules. The district judge imposed the ban after his legal adviser Pam Bower asked a 42-year-old defendant if he would confirm his identity during a recent hearing and got the reply: ‘Yes, love.’ The man, who was on remand and appearing on a video link, was later freed from custody on conditional bail. Judge Foster, 64, said courts ‘have to maintain proper standards’, adding: ‘Courts are solemn places and serious. 'They are not places for chatty discussions.’ But regional campaign groups condemned the move. Graeme Garvey, from the Yorkshire  Dialect Society, said: ‘The judge is, himself, being discriminatory in insisting on Standard English usage over traditional Yorkshire dialect. 'Love' is a non-sexual term which has been and is used by people of both . genders to people of both genders. It is a term of endearment. Love-free zone: From now on, defendants appearing at Barnsley . Magistrates Court, above, are to address female court staff as . 'ma'am' 'The . key issue regarding the current case is if the usage is patronising and . that is a value judgement not susceptible to objective proof. 'If it is not used patronisingly then . the judge, himself, is in error. If the plaintiff were to arraign the . judge for linguistic discrimination, I feel he would have a strong . case.' Keith Madeley, from the Yorkshire . Society, an organisation which encourages business and all things . Yorkshire, added: 'I think that you've got to be careful that you don't . lose the affectionate terms that we use for each other as part of our . regional dialects. 'If the . term is used in the right way I see nothing wrong with it, in other . parts of the country I believe they refer to one another as ""duck"", are we . going to stop that as well?' Defending against the cries of foul against the Yorkshire dialect the Judicial Office on behalf of Judge Foster said: 'He simply asked the defendant to observe ordinary courtesy and respect towards an officer of the court. 'And that the standards demanded upon this occasion were no different to those applied in every other court in the land on every day upon which they sit.' CHUCK: A favourite in the north west of the country . KIDDA: Originally used in Liverpool but now also used in parts of North Wales . OUR KID: Often used to refer to a brother or close friend in Manchester . BABBA: Meaning 'baby' or 'friend' and originated in Bristol . MY LOVER: Another term originating from Bristol but is now heard throughout the south west of the country . BOYO: Out of date, but can occasionally still be heard in the Welsh Valleys . OLD BEAN: Originating in the south east, this is a jocular form of addressing a man, dating from the 1910s. TREACLE: Out-and-out Cockney. Used by men to describe women, derived from the 'treacle tart' rhyming slang meaning of sweetheart. GEEZER: Used in the south east as slang for man, but it actually dates from the 15th century word for actor - which was 'guiser' PET: The popular Geordie expression for women, originates from the notion that pets need looking after . PETAL: Another term for women, which can be heard all over the North East . HEN: Scottish slang for woman or girl . DOLL: An affectionate term for women, used by men in Scotland . CHICKEN: The tables turn with this term, for it is mainly used by women about men in the North East. LASS: Term for a young woman or girl, widely used across Yorkshire . FLOWER: Another well-used phrase in Yorkshire - again for women . BAB: A variation on the word 'babe' and used to greet Brummie women . ME DUCK: Heard in Derbyshire, but dates back to the 1500s when Shakespeare used the phrase 'dainty duck' for sweetheart.","Defendants must now call women 'ma'am'

"By . Reuters Reporter . Last updated at 11:47 PM on 13th February 2012 . Washington state became the seventh in the nation to legalize same-sex marriage, even as opponents of the measure signed by Governor Christine Gregoire Monday vowed to prevent the law from ever taking effect. The measure, which won approval from state lawmakers last Wednesday, remains essentially on hold for a standard 90 day waiting period, meaning gay couples can't begin to walk down the aisle in the northwest state just yet. Opponents of the statute have promised to seek its repeal through a ballot measure at the polls in November that could delay enactment further or halt it entirely. The issue is also likely to figure in the state's Republican presidential politics. Signed into law: Gov Christine Gregoire celebrates with supporters after legalizing gay marriage in Washington state . Still, the bill-signing marked another key victory for gay rights advocates after a federal appeals court declared a voter-approved gay marriage ban in California unconstitutional last week, and the New Jersey state Senate approved a same-sex marriage bill earlier on Monday. Gregoire, a Democrat and a Catholic, signed Washington's measure to raucous applause during a ceremony in the ornate reception room of the Olympia statehouse. 'This is a very proud moment... I'm proud of who and what we are as a state,' she declared. Several dozen protesters, including members of the group Knights of Columbus, stood silently in the Capitol Rotunda overlooking the reception hall holding signs with slogans declaring that marriage is meant to be 'one man, one woman.' Republican White House candidate Rick Santorum, a staunch conservative and outspoken foe of same-sex marriage, was making two stops in Washington state on Monday to galvanize support for the Republican caucuses there on March 3. Seven states: The states in red allow same-sex couples to marry. California briefly allowed gay marriages until a referendum that banned them. The issues is currently in the courts . Allowed then stopped: San Francisco issued gay marriage licenses in 2004, but then was stopped from the practice after court rulings . He was to meet with Republican lawmakers in Olympia in the afternoon, then give a speech in Tacoma on Monday night. Anticipating the repeal campaign that lies ahead later this year, the governor added, 'I ask all Washingtonians to look into your hearts and ask yourselves -- isn't it time? ... We in this state stand proud for equality.' Democrats, who control both legislative bodies in Olympia, accounted for . In 2004, Massachusetts became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage in the United States as a result of a ruling by the state Supreme Court. Connecticut was the second state to make gay marriages legal after a state Supreme Court ruling in 2008. The Iowa Supreme Court overturned a ban on same sex marriages April 3, 2009, making them legal there. Vermont became the first state to make gay marriage legal with a legislative vote after lawmakers overrode the governor's veto April 7, 2009. In New Hampshire, lawmakers approved a same-sex marriage bill and it was signed by the governor June 3, 2009. On December 15, 2009, the Washington DC city council voted to allow gay marriage. New York became the most recent state to legalize gay marriage after a vote of the legislature in 2011. the lion's share of support for the . measure. The stage for swift passage of the measure this year was set . after Gregoire, who is in her last term of office, said last month she . would endorse such a law. Several prominent Washington-based companies employing tens of thousands of workers in the state have supported the bill, including Microsoft, Amazon and Starbucks. Opponents were led by Roman Catholic bishops and other religious conservatives. Gay marriage efforts elsewhere . Supporters of same-sex marriage are pushing similar statutes in Maryland and New Jersey, whose Democratic-controlled state Senate in Trenton approved a gay marriage bill earlier on Monday. Republican Governor Chris Christie has vowed to veto it if it reaches his desk. A referendum to legalize gay marriage in Maine has qualified for the November ballot there. Six other states already recognize gay marriage -- New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire and Iowa -- as does the District of Columbia. Two of Washington state's leading proponents of gay marriage, state Representative Jamie Pedersen and state Senator Ed Murray, hailed the work of Olympia's legislature. 'Years from now, our kids will look back and wonder what all the fuss was about,' said Pedersen, who has four young children with his partner of 10 years. Murray, who has said he will marry his companion of nearly 20 years, added, 'My friends, welcome to the other side of the rainbow.' In the meantime, opponents of same-sex matrimony have said they would seek to overturn the legislation via one of two ballot measures -- a referendum for repeal or an initiative defining marriage as the exclusive domain of heterosexual couples. If a repeal referendum qualifies for the November ballot, the gay marriage law would be suspended until the certification of election returns in December, before it is either repealed or goes into effect. But qualification of a proposed initiative defining matrimony as restricted to one man and one woman would not, in and of itself, prevent gay marriages from proceeding under the newly passed statute starting on June 7. It remains unclear whether gay weddings performed in the interim would be nullified if an initiative were to pass in November.","Opponents vow to take the issue to voters in November and have the law overturned .

A veteran television anchor who was bitten in the face by an 85-pound dog during a live broadcast says she needed 70 stitches in her lips and nose. Kyle Dyer of Denver's KUSA-TV wrote on her Facebook page over the weekend that she can't talk because her mouth is stitched shut to let a skin graft take and so blood can circulate in her lips again. The Facebook post says she expects another procedure in the next few weeks. Scroll down for video (Warning: Graphic content) On TV: Kyle Dyer, right, had knelt down to pet Max when he attacked. He is seen here with his owner, Michael Robinson, and the firefighter that rescued him . Attack: In a flash, Max bares his teeth and lashes out at Ms Dyers face. Animal control officers called it a 'pretty major bite.' Ms Dyer was injured on Wednesday . while doing an on-air segment with the dog's owner and a firefighter who . had rescued the Argentine Mastiff from an icy pond in suburban Lakewood . the day before.

A . video of Max trying unsuccessfully to find a way out of the pond was . released last week, and provides some context for the background which . led him to lash out the next day. Though immediate reports said that he was not properly vaccinated, the owners of the dog have put out a statement saying that he was up-to-date with all of his shots. 'Max is current in his vaccinations. Max has no history of aggression. Max is a gentle, loving, family dog. Max is well mannered and obedient and he hardly barks,' said the dog's owners The Robinsons in a statement.

Treatment: Ms Dyer is now recovering after surgery Wednesday afternoon at Denver Health Medical Center . 'This incident truly is unfortunate and does not reflect Max’s disposition towards people.' Now, Max has been caged by animal control officers and his owner, Michael Robinson has been fined. In . addition to comments wishing Ms Dyer well, most Facebook respondents . left angry messages blaming her for getting too close to the dog. 'I totally agree with all those saying it was her own fault and she should have known better,' wrote Cassandra Hughes Kramer. 'The dog was being a dog, defending . itself in a stressful situation. He didn't jump on her and maul her, he . nipped her lip... and she shouldn't have been trying to kiss him. Maybe . it's a hard lesson to learn, but hopefully she learned it.' Struggle: Max the dog was filmed swimming around in an icy pool, unable to escape . Rescue: The dog was recovered thanks to a fireman, leading to his ill-fated appearance on the news . A number of viewers also expressed . concern that the dog would be euthanized as a result of the incident, . which was something they appeared angry about. 'It was clearly human fault. Why should the animal be blamed for both the owner an kyle's mistake? Argentine mastiffs, also known as the . Argentine Dogo, are known as big-game hunters and historically have . gone after wild boars and pumas. While they are now used as pets, they were bred from a rather violent group of dogs. Because of the dogs' violent nature, several areas have banned the breed, including Aurora, Colorado. Aurora is the neighbouring city to Denver, where the broadcast took place. The . animal is also banned in New York City public housing, and laws in the . UK allow police to take the dogs away from their owners and prosecute . them. Hope he isn't put down, it would be a crime,' wrote Bruno Naletto. Brendan Flynn echoed that sentiment, writing: 'Lord knows 9News will hear from all of us and alot more if Max is put down.' Unless the dog has rabies - which it is not showing signs of - it will not be put down. Even if the vaccinations are current, the owners will definitely face two charges from Denver Animal Care and Control: a penalty for having the dog bite someone and a second penalty for having the dog off its leash at the time. 'While we normally walk Max on-leash, we understand that by letting him off-leash in an open area away from anyone was still a mistake. We will never walk him off-leash in public areas after this,' the Robinsons said in their statement. Max was brought into the studio after the station's news chopper captured . video footage of a firefighter rescuing Max from a freezing pond Monday . after he fell through the ice and couldn't make it out. 'I know that she is a great journalist . who loves happy stories - this was a happy story,' her co-anchor Gary . Shapiro said in a note to fans. 'Kyle was glad she got assigned to it, because she loves animals,' Mr Shapiro said. Though she is out of the hospital, her recovery is just beginning. Ms Dyer, who is married and has children, is expected to take several weeks to return to work. 'She's . doing well, and will make a recovery, and we're all thinking about her . and her family,' said 9News vice president Patti Dennis.

"By . Wil Longbottom . Last updated at 4:37 PM on 14th February 2012 . A Chinese technology firm that claims it owns the iPad trademark is planning on seeking a ban on exports of Apple's computer tablets from China, a lawyer for the company has said. If successful, the move could deal a blow to the U.S. tech giant's iPad sales worldwide. Not only is China a huge consumer market, but it is a major production base for the U.S. company's products including the iPad, iPhone and iPod. Potential shortage? iPads on sale in a store in Zurich. There are fears sales could plummet if a Chinese company successfully blocks exports in a row over trademark ownership . The Chinese firm Proview Technology (Shenzen) Co Ltd is petitioning Chinese customs to stop shipments of the popular tablet computers in and out of China, although customs have not yet responded to the request. The legal row with Proview Technology is the latest headache for Apple in a booming market. Last year, Apple lost a case against the same company in Shenzen when a court agreed that Proview owned the iPad trademark. It has appealed that decision and a final hearing is due to start in Guangdong High Court on February 29. That court's decision will be final under the Chinese legal process. It comes a day after reports claimed . that authorities in some Chinese cities had ordered retailers to stop . selling iPads due to the dispute. Apple claims it had bought the worldwide rights to the trademark long ago. Row: Proview Technology (Shenzen) Co Ltd won a court battle last year which ruled it owned the copyright to the trademark iPad, although Apple is appealing that decision . A spokesman said: 'We bought Proview's worldwide rights to the iPad trademark in ten different countries several years ago. 'Proview refuses to honour their agreement with Apple in China and a Hong Kong court has sided with Apple in this matter.' Proview Technology has asked authorities in around 20 cities, including Shijiazhuang near Beijing, to stop retailers selling iPads and has also filed lawsuits against Apple in Shanghai, Shenzhen, Futian and Huizhou. Apple could be limited to either settling with the company, appealing to a higher court or facing devastating enforcement action in China, legal experts have said. Elliot Papageorgiou, of law firm Rouse Legal (China), said: 'There are two views we can take here. One view is, Apple was not sufficiently prudent and therefore, this was missed by Apple and its attorneys. 'A more charitable view would be that Apple said that for business reasons we need to use this brand and as far as the name in China is concerned, let's cross the bridge when we come to it.' Proview lawyer Xie, of Grandall Law Firm, said Apple was not currently in negotiations with the Chinese company. It is believed to be seeking up to $1.6billion in compensation from Apple for trademark infringement. Stan Abrams, an intellectual property law professor at Beijing's Central University of Finance and Economics, said: 'Without a win in that Shenzhen case, all the other actions, whether it is administrative or with different courts, customs, Apple is not in a good position at all.'","Proview Technology (Shenzen) seeks ban on export of iPads in ongoing trademark row .

Beaming: Al Pacino, the 71-year-old star of films such as The Godfather and Scarface, was praised by Barack Obama for his 'signature intensity as an actor' at the glittering White House ceremony . ‘Mr Pacino is an enduring and iconic figure, who came of age in one of the most exciting decades of American cinema, the 1970s,’ the award citation read at the East Room ceremony on Monday said. ‘His signature intensity as an actor was originally honed for the stage, under the tutelage of Lee Strasberg, and he has become one of the most outstanding and accomplished American artists.’ President Obama said: ‘We are told we are divided as a people, then suddenly the arts have the power to bring us together’. He thanked the recipients for ‘bringing new possibilities to all of us’. The Commander-in-Chief drew applause when he said that the arts and humanities would remain a priority while he was President.

The multi-million battle for Amanda Knox’s story is hotting up as publishers and television networks fight for the world-famous American student who was cleared of murder to sign on the dotted line. Knox, 24, hired the same literary agent as Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Elton John to negotiate a deal - and publishing executives are reportedly ‘falling in love with her’ as she meets with them. Meanwhile Knox, who successfully appealed a conviction last autumn over the murder of Meredith Kercher in Perugia, Italy, was spotted cycling in her hometown of Seattle, Washington, on Sunday. Out and about: Knox, who successfully appealed a conviction last autumn for murdering Meredith Kercher in Perugia, Italy, was spotted cycling in her hometown of Seattle, Washington, on Sunday . ‘I think it’s a huge gamble for somebody,’ one publisher who does not expect to bid on Knox’s book told the New York Times. ‘It’s not like she has been exonerated in a clear and definitive way.’ Knox has previously said she wants to be a writer. Her story is even more world-famous than that of Casey Anthony, 25, who was cleared of murdering her toddler daughter in Florida last year. Former University of Washington student Knox spent almost four years in prison abroad but has said little about what happened in public - and that’s what publishers want to get out of her now. But some publishers are concerned that a seven-figure advance might not be worth it - and there are only a select few who could take that kind of risk on Knox, reported the New York Times. On the phone: Amanda Knox, pictured on Sunday, spent almost four years in prison abroad but has said little about what happened in public - and that's what publishers want to get out of her now . The value of her story has been compared to that of Jaycee Dugard, who was kidnapped and held captive for almost two decades. She had a book published last July that has sold 1.2million copies. 'I think it’s a huge gamble for somebody. It’s not like she has been exonerated in a clear and definitive way' Anonymous publisher . Meanwhile Knox’s ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, who also had his conviction overturned last October, has a literary agent and ghost-writer in Seattle, reported the New York Times. ‘I’m honoured to work with this fine young man and let the world know the real Raffaele,’ said Sharlene Martin, a literary agent in Seattle. ‘A sensitive, compassionate and heartfelt person.’ Knox herself acquired Washington lawyer Robert Barnett to represent her in a book deal and networks are stepping over each other to get the first interview since her release from prison. ‘The world has heard from everybody else,’ one publishing executive who is interested in bidding told the New York Times. ‘But the world has not actually heard from Amanda Knox.’ Former flatmates: Amanda Knox, left, won her appeal last October for murdering Meredith Kercher, 21, right . Other deal: Knox's ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, who also had his conviction overturned last October, also has a literary agent and ghost-writer . Last week lawyers for Knox asked an appeals court in Italy to overturn her slander conviction as well, but it was not clear when the court would issue a ruling. 'Everybody fell in love with her' Publishing executive . It stems from statements she made to police in 2007 that falsely implicated bar owner Patrick Lumumba in the murder of Ms Kercher, 21. She told a court later on that police pressured her. Ivorian drifter Rudy Guede is now the only person convicted in the killing. Kercher's body was found, with more than 40 stab wounds and a deep gash in her throat, in the flat she shared with Knox. Knox’s family say they have spent more than $1million in legal, travel and living costs to be near her during the murder trial. Experts estimate they may have spent even more on her appeal.

Seven-year-old JR has horns that measure an incredible 9ft 1ins - and they are likely to grow even bigger. But even though he has a name derived from a character in Dallas, the ultimate Texas television show, JR does not reside in the U.S. Scroll down for video . World record holder: Texas Longhorn bull JR, who lives in Queensland, Australia, has horns that measure an incredible 9ft 1in . Instead, he is part of the largest herd of Texas Longhorns in Australia, roaming around the 1,100acre Leahton Park estate in Queensland. He has claimed the Guinness World Record from a bull in Ohio called Shadow Jubilee. But whereas that animal had horns that are 88ins long, JR's measure a staggering 109ins from tip-to-tip. JR is descended from pure Texas Longhorn stock. His owner Michael Bethel, 50, who runs Leahton Park with his wife Lynda, 39, began breeding Longhorns 14 years ago. Tourist attraction: JR is part of the largest herd of Texas Longhorns in Australia, roaming around the 1,100acre Leahton Park estate . He said: 'I don't think JR realises how much attention he's getting now he's a record breaker. 'He's just happy and healthy, we don't . give him any special treatment, we just let him graze around with the . kangaroos like the rest of the heard. 'He's only seven so he still has a . bit of growing to do yet - they can live until their early 20s - his . horns could still get bigger.' The park opened as a tourist attraction three years ago to allow visitors to take horse-drawn wagon tours to see the Longhorns. Texas Longhorn: By the time of its first birthday, the horns have grown to about 50 per cent of their total tip-to-tip size . Texas Longhorns are bred for their lean meat as well as their striking colour and horns. Their gentle demeanour means it is extremely rare for a Texas Longhorn to attack a human. However, care is required when in their vicinity because of the size of their horns, which they use to scratch their bodies. By the time of its first birthday, the horns have grown to about 50 per cent of their total tip-to-tip size. This growth reaches 95 per cent between five and six years of age. The horns continue to grow but this rapidly slows down as the bull gets older. Horns grow from the base, resulting in 'growth rings' that can be seen near the head of older cattle. Many ranchers sell mounted horns to be hung in homes and public places. The horns are an official symbol of Fort Worth in Texas, while the Texas Longhorn is the Texas State Large Mammal. Texas Longhorns are descendants of cattle brought across the Atlantic by the Spanish in the late 1400s and early 1500s. But the gentle, intelligent cattle had actually come from the Canary Islands, and before then had originated in Portugal. They finally became a registered breed in the U.S. following the founding of the Texas Longhorn Breeders Association of America in 1964. However, unlike most cattle, nobody set out to develop them as a breed - they had naturally evolved over the course of almost 500 years.","Seven-year-old JR has horns that measure an incredible 9ft 1in long .

Apple has opened up its Chinese factories to independent examiners after claims that workers were subjected to appalling sweatshop conditions. The technology giant announced yesterday that members of the Washington-based Fair Labour Association would be checking the factories where iPads and iPhones are assembled. The team of observers began their inspections yesterday at Foxconn City in Shenzhen, China, a complex that employs and houses hundreds of thousands of workers. Poor conditions: A protester outside Apple's . Hong Kong store. An investigation has found Apple's pledges to improve . its working practices have proved hollow . Glitzy: Apple's shops, such as this one in London's Covent Garden, are a world away from the 'harsh' environments in its Chinese factories . According to reports, some Apple workers in China had to work 15-hour days for as little as £27-a-month. As many as 100 workers have been injured by toxic chemical exposures and audits have revealed under age employees and examples of pay being withheld as punishment. Apple said it has asked the anti-sweatshop group to carry out the ‘special voluntary audits.' ‘We believe that workers everywhere have the right to a safe and fair work environment, which is why we’ve asked the FLA to independently assess the performance of our largest suppliers,’ Apple chief executive Tim Cook said yesterday. ‘The inspections now under way are unprecedented in the electronics industry, both in scale and scope,’ he added. Workers in a Chinese Apple factory. An . investigation found some Apple workers in China had to work 15 hours a . day for £27 a month . Foxconn City is a unit of Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Company which employs up to 1.1million people in a series of huge factory complexes in China. Apple shares hit an all-time high as the company announced it would investigate the alleged ‘sweat shop’ conditions in its supplier’s factories. The shares broke through the $500 mark in early trading in New York yesterday, equivalent to £317 each. It values the electronics monolith at just shy of £300billion ($460billion) - making it the most valuable company in the world. It comes just seven months after shares topped the $400 mark. The New York Times claimed last month that Apple found ‘consistent violations’ of its code of conduct after inspecting 396 of its facilities. ‘The workers assembling iPhones and iPads…work excessive overtime. 'Some say they stand so long that their legs swell until they can hardly walk,’ said the Times. In 2009, a Foxconn employee fell or jumped from an apartment building after losing an iPhone prototype. Over the next two years, at least 18 other Foxconn workers were linked to attempted suicides. Despite claims to the contrary, the abuses appear to have continued. Last month, 150 Foxconn employees . threatened to leap from a three-story building after claiming of poor . pay and pressurised working conditions. Pictured, the late Apple founder Steve Jobs. Apple found 'consistent violations' of its code of conduct after . inspecting 396 of its sub-contractor facilities . The Chinese company – which also manufactures items for Sony, Nintendo and Hewlett Packard - has disputed allegations of back-to-back shifts and crowded living conditions. But the suppliers have agreed to give ‘unrestricted’ access to their plants, said Apple. July 2009: A Foxconn employee fell from apartment building after losing iPhone prototype. 18 more workers try to commit suicide over next two years. 2010: 137 workers at Suzhou facility, owned by Apple suppliers Wintek, injured by poisonous chemical, n-hexane, used to clean iPhone screens because it dried faster. May 2011: Four workers dead and 18  injured in dust explosion at Foxconn factory in Chengdu, which produces iPad parts. December 2011: 61 workers injured in gas explosion at Riteng Computer Accessory Co factory in Shanghai, which was trialling aluminium iPad 2 back panels. A month ago, the California-based firm took the step of becoming the first technology company to become a member of the non-profit Fair Labour Association, a group of businesses and universities focused on improving working conditions around the world. The FLA plans to interview thousands of employees at several Apple suppliers. The audits will cover facilities where more than 90per cent of Apple products are put together. The findings will be posted on the website www.fairlabor.org in early March. But campaign group for Chinese workers, China Labour Watch, criticised Apple for just conducting a public relations exercise. In an open letter to Mr Cook last week it demanded Apple accept lower profits so suppliers can raise wages, employ more staff and invest in improving safety. And group activist Fan Yuan said: 'We already know what the conditions are like in the factories. 'What Apple needs to do right now is take action to solve the problems. This move is not really about solving the problems, but rather about Apple getting publicity and rebuilding its positive image.'","Comes as firm becomes most valuable in the world .

Jean-Claude Baumgartner, 50, is charged with duping Peter Jones and Theo Paphitis into handing over the money as an investment - then spending it on himself.

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 9:50 PM on 13th February 2012 . Legal high: Methoxetamine was linked to two deaths in Leicestershire at the weekend . A new legal high billed as a safe alternative to ketamine is flooding on to Britain's streets, a charity has said. Methoxetamine - which can easily be bought online - has seen a surge in popularity in Britain and across northern Europe in recent months. The drug, also known as MXE or mexxy, is described as having the same effect as ketamine without the side effects. However, police are linking it to the . deaths of a 59-year-old woman and a 32-year-old man in Leicester and . Melton Mowbray over the weekend. It is believed to be the first time the new high has been linked to fatalities in Britain. Detective Inspector Rob Widdowson, of . Leicestershire Police, said: 'We are investigating the circumstances . leading to the deaths of these two people in order to prepare files for . the coroner. 'One of our lines of inquiry is that . prior to their deaths both people may have taken a form of the drug . ketamine, known medically as methoxetamine, which may have been . purchased over the internet.' Party drug: Methoxetamine has been billed as a safe alternative to ketamine - although there is no evidence the claims are true . However, MXE has become popular because unlike ketamine it is claimed it does not cause severe bladder cramps. Methoxetamine is just the latest legal high to appear on Britain's streets. Many of the concoctions are dangerous - but because the authorities know so little about them they can be taken without fear of prosecution. The number of legal highs on sale hit 40 last year, up from just 13 in 2008. Doctors believe that these drugs could lead to psychosis, liver damage and even death — warnings which are going unheeded by ­consumers, and the Government. As these drugs are legal, it means premium prices - and profits. For instance, a small packet of Blast Off - a herbal marijuana substitute - costs £30, more than four times the price of the same amount of marijuana. However, far from being a benign, risk-free way of taking drugs, the growing army of British users are risking their lives by ingesting potentially lethal ­cocktails of chemicals, often concocted by corrupt pharmacists working in China and India. The legal high Mephedrone - or meow meow - was banned in 2010 after being linked to up to 100 deaths. However, it was rapidly replaced by MDMA. Ivory Cove is another popular 'legal high' which is yet to be banned. Also, as ketamine is an illegal Class C drug, anyone taking the legal high is not at risk of prosecution. But despite claims that MXE is 'safer' than the illegal alternative there is no evidence that it is true - and experts say that it can cause mental health problems. It is sold online as plant feeder or bath salt in the same way as mephedrone was before it was banned. It is marked as 'not fit for human consumption'. The authors of a Druglink Street Drug Trends 2011 report wrote: 'As with the former legal high drug mephedrone, which mimicked ecstasy and cocaine, ketamine now has its legal doppelganger – in the form of methoxetamine (MXE). 'The drug is sometimes advertised online as a ""bladder-friendly"" ketamine substitute, has similar effects to its illegal counterpart and according to one expert has ""an expanding fan-base"".' The drug is sold online for around £17 per gram. The line between illegal and legal recreational drugs has become blurred in recent years with a number of legal substitutes flooding the market. Fiona Measham, a researcher for the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs, told the Independent: 'The new kid on the block seems to be methoxetamine. 'It is growing in popularity, not just in the UK but in northern Europe. It's so similar in chemical structure to ketamine there is no evidence to suggest that it doesn't carry the same risks, or that it is bladder-friendly'.","Methoxetamine may have killed two people at the weekend, police say .

The U.S. visit seeks to better acquaint politicians and opinion makers . with the man widely expected to begin taking charge later this year of . the world's second largest economy and biggest overseas holder of U.S. government debt. Despite their close economic links, China and the U.S. remain major . rivals in the Asia-Pacific region, with Washington's traditional . alliances competing with China's economic and cultural influence.

Meanwhile, the perceived economic threat posed by China to the U.S. has . also featured prominently in the Republican Party presidential . nomination process. One aspect of Xi's visit will be to gauge public . perceptions of China in the U.S. and seek ways of overcoming a lack of . trust between the sides, a task made more difficult by disputes over . trade, Taiwan, human rights and international concerns such as . intervening in the ongoing violence in Syria. Writing in the official English-language China Daily newspaper, a . collection of well-known Chinese scholars said ties are dogged by strong .

Studies, top advisers to Chinese President Hu Jintao, wrote: 'Judging from the present situation of China-U.S. relations, the . strategic mutual trust between the two sides still lags far behind the . common interests they actually share.' In written responses to questions from The Washington Post, Xi . highlighted the profitability of U.S. companies operating in China, . along with Beijing's efforts to address American concerns over . intellectual property theft and claims that the Chinese currency is . deliberately undervalued to help boost exports. But he also made a dig at U.S. efforts to strengthen its military . alliances in Asia, saying what U.S. officials have said are hardline . personal views on China's security and national dignity. He said: 'We welcome a constructive role by the United States in promoting peace, . stability and prosperity in the region. 'We also hope that the United . States will fully respect and accommodate the major interest and . legitimate concerns of Asia-Pacific countries.' Xi's visit is unlikely to produce major commercial deals, in contrast to . earlier trips by Chinese officials that often featured purchases of . U.S. jetliners and other goods in an effort to ease tension over . Beijing's multibillion-dollar trade surplus. On Wednesday, Chinese officials are due to attend the signing in Des . Moines, Iowa, of a purchase agreement for soy beans, the biggest single . U.S. export to China. No details of price or size were announced. Businessmen and trade groups said they knew of no other major deals . scheduled to be completed during the visit. A spokesman at Boeing Co., .

"By . Anthony Bond . Last updated at 6:31 PM on 25th January 2012 . A mysterious blood-thirsty wild cat is feared to have struck again after three wallabies were found devoured on farmland. The trio were found stripped to the bone, with their internal organs neatly placed beside their bodies. Examinations . revealed they had suffered puncture wounds to the neck - consistent . with a vicious attack by a panther-like creature. Devoured: The remains of one of the wallabies which is believed to have been killed by the Wildcat of Woodchester, which is feared to have killed three deer earlier this month . Is this it? This image of a large black animal was captured in a field in north-west Wiltshire and could be the beast that is stalking the Cotswolds . Experts now believe the animals were devoured by the Wildcat of Woodchester which is already believed to have killed three times this month. The . mutilated bodies of three deer have been found in the past few weeks in . countryside near Stroud, Gloucestershire -  just 12 miles from where the wallabies were mauled to death. The wallabies were found only 12 miles apart leading to the belief that it was the same cat . Samples of DNA  from the . predator's first deer kill on January 4 are currently being tested to . confirm whether or not a big cat is behind the killings. The results are expected to be revealed over the next few days. But big cat expert Frank Tunbridge is in no doubt over who killed the wallabies and the deer. Mr Tunbridge, 65, said: 'There could be no creature other than a big cat that could bring down and kill these wallabies. 'The field was surrounded by a 7ft fence and there was no apparent entry signs - so the predator must have leapt over it. 'The . killer struck over two nights. The first night he killed two wallabies, . stripped one of the carcasses down and hid the other under a pile of . leaves and straw. 'Then he came back and killed a third - devouring his further kills. A fourth wallaby appears to have died from a heart attack. 'The wallabies are only about 12 miles from Woodchester so it appears that this could be the same big cat. 'They have all the hallmarks of a panther or puma kill.' The wallabies, part of a private collection, were found by their devastated owner on January 6 - two days after the apparent first kill by the Wildcat of Woodchester. The Gloucestershire farmer did not want to divulge his name or location. Examination: A man completes a DNA test on the carcass of one of the deer killed earlier this month which will confirm whether or not a big cat was responsible . But he did release gory pictures of one of the dead wallabies. The carcass had been ripped open in a similar way to the three roe deers the beast is believed to have slayed. The first deer had been torn open and was missing its heart, kidneys and liver. Its snout was also missing - important because big cats clamp their jaws over the mouth, causing death by suffocation. Experts believe the deer was brought down and devoured by a large and powerful predator such as a puma, jaguar or leopard. Tufts of the animal’s fur were also found piled by the body - and such predators neatly pluck the hair from the body before shearing their teeth into the flesh. Tests: This roe deer was killed less than 12 miles from where the big cat is feared to have devoured three wallabies . Another deer carcass was found by a dog walker between Whiteway and Redcomb, near Cirencester - ten miles away - on January 10. A third roe deer body was found at a development in Cooper’s Edge, near Gloucester, days later. Dr Robin Allaby, an expert in evolutionary genetics at Warwick University’s School of Life Sciences, is studying samples of DNA taken from the first carcass. He said: 'I’m prepared to believe in the existence of big cats in the UK and we have a reasonable chance of finding out if it was there. 'We are in the process of studying samples of DNA taken from the deer and if its death was the result of a big cat then we’re hoping it left cheek cells and saliva.'","Trio found stripped to the bone with internal organs neatly placed beside their bodies .

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 8:21 PM on 14th February 2012 . A restaurant owner stalked a wealthy housewife as she went shopping for groceries for a year - despite her determined attempts to give him the slip. Married father-of-two Tony Leung, 49, terrorised Michelle Warnes by following her around the aisles of Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer stores. The mother-of-one was so scared of the unwanted admirer that she regularly switched supermarkets, dressed down in tracksuits and borrowed her daughter's car to avoid being recognised. 'Supermarket creep': Tony Leung, pictured leaving court, was given a restraining order to stop him going near shopper Michelle Warnes . She also asked her husband to change the personalised plate on her own vehicle. But Leung kept Mrs Warnes, aged in her 30s, under surveillance in stores across Cheshire, the court was told. The man - dubbed 'the Supermarket Creep - has now been given a restraining order after being convicted of harassment at Macclesfield magistrates' court. He was eventually arrested after Mrs Warnes took down the registration number of his Volkswagen Golf car when she spotted him staring at her at a Sainsbury's in Wilmslow, Cheshire. Leung had been accused of a 'strikingly similar' stalking campaign against another woman but she was unable to give evidence. Mrs Warnes was so traumatised that she decided to take up self-defence classes, started shopping online and avoids Chinese and Thai restaurants like the one Leung works in. Confrontation: Tony Leung was accused of stalking and appearing to film Mrs Warnes at this M&S store in Handforth Dean, Cheshire . Each time Leung saw his target he would hold a messenger bag in front of her as if he was filming, the court was told. In her victim impact statement, read out in court, said: 'I will only shop at one particular shop near to a police station because I feel safe there. 'On occasions I'm always looking for his car if I go out on my own. I have also started to do internet shopping. 'I used to go out often and see girlfriends for lunch but I won't go socialising in Manchester any more. I can't go to certain supermarkets I want to go to. 'The way that I dressed before all this I would never dream of going out in a tracksuit but this is what I wear now. I want to blend in as much as possible. I don't wear any jewellery. I won't take expensive handbags out with me. 'I told my husband that I wanted to change the car as it has a personal registration plate. I'm driving my daughter's car because it's less obvious. 'I have spoken to my personal trainer who has suggested self-defence classes. I have CCTV in my driveway and garden and monitor this as well so I can see what's going on.' Leung began stalking Mrs Warnes in May 2010 as she shopped in Sainsbury's in Altrincham. Giving her evidence from behind a screen she said: 'I was in the store when I noticed this Chinese man following and staring at me. 'It was clear he wanted to make eye contact with me. He scared me and made me feel very unsafe. Then he just disappeared. It happened about three times at the store and on the last occasion I told the security guard. 'I did not feel safe and stopped wearing nice clothes and jewellery and wouldn't carry a handbag. 'Creep': Mrs Warnes also spotted restaurateur Tony Leung, 49, in this Sainsbury's store in Wilmslow . 'I always dressed nicely so my daughter and husband noticed. I even started using my daughter's car and was so frightened I didn't want to leave the house and started to order food online.' Mrs Warnes switched to a Marks & Spencers store eight miles away at Handforth Dean, near Wilmslow but Leung appeared there too. In May last year she moved stores again this time to Sainsbury's in Wilmslow only to burst into tears when she found Leung standing in front of her. She added: 'He stopped directly in front of me and stared and I broke down and cried. He always had a messenger bag and kept moving it. It felt like he was filming me.' In May last year police went to Leung's home in Wilmslow to warn him about his behaviour but Mrs Warnes bumped into him again at another supermarket and he was arrested a month later. Leung, whose wife works at Manchester Airport, denied harassment but was convicted after a trial. He said: 'I have two children I take to school in Altrincham and so sometimes I shop there. 'I live in Wilmslow so I also shop in the various supermarkets around the town. I don't always buy goods when I'm there - sometimes I go to compare prices.' In mitigation defence lawyer John Wolfson said: 'He's a man of prior good character and he has a family of young children and a business. 'He and his family have been very upset about what might happen to him. The mind plays strange tricks sometimes. She may have genuinely believed Mr Leung was acting inappropriately but in truth he was not.' Leung was given a 12 month community order with supervision requirements and ordered to complete 300 hours unpaid work. He was also ordered to pay £620 court costs and £1,000 compensation to the victim. Leung said he intends to appeal against his conviction.","Michelle Warnes switched supermarkets, dressed down and borrowed daughter's car to avoid being recognised .

Novelty T-shirts celebrating a county's famous stars under the slogan 'T'Only Way Is Yorkshire' has been slammed for featuring a cartoon of the Yorkshire Ripper. The image of mass killer Peter Sutcliffe is contained alongside other well-known people or characters but has been condemned as 'tasteless' and 'disgusting'. The garments have been produced by London-based firm Totally Original T-shirts which imitate the popular TV series The Only Way Is Essex. Criticised: The image of mass killer Peter Sutcliffe (far left) is contained alongside other well-known people or characters but has been condemned as 'tasteless' and 'disgusting' A senior councillor has called for the company to immediately remove the items from sale. Executive member, Coun David Green, whose responsibilities include tourism, described the decision to include the Ripper as 'the lowest of the low'. He said: 'It's thoughtless, tasteless and the most disgusting, exploitative piece of clothing I have ever heard of. Killer: Peter Sutcliffe, of Bradford, was convicted in 1981 of the murders of 13 women and the attempted murders of seven others . 'To make money out of something like this is outrageous. 'I would suggest this company needs to re-think it's design and withdraw it from sale until Peter Sutcliffe is removed.' Among the other well-known faces on the T-shirt, claimed by the makers to be a homage to all things that make Yorkshire great, are Yorkshire-born former Prime Minister Harold Wilson in a flat cap, actress Diana Rigg in a cat suit, Last of the Summer Wine character Nora Batty and former England cricketer Geoffrey Boycott. They are shown perched on or behind a sofa and a drystone wall with pigeons and greyhounds. Sutcliffe, of Bradford, was convicted in 1981 of the murders of 13 women and the attempted murders of seven others during a reign of terror which started in the mid-1970s. The T-shirt is one of the Grim Up North range, according to the manufacturer's website, described as 'celebrating the best of Northern style and humour'. A Yorkshireman who received one of the T-shirts as a present and has since complained, said: 'How can anyone design a T-shirt with him on the front and how can anyone wear it?' A spokesman for TOT-shirts said: 'It's just a bit of dark humour and if it's offended anyone it wasn't intentional. 'If the man who was offended wants to get in touch with us we'll replace it with another T-shirt of his choice. 'We sell lots of our Grim Up North range to northerners which proves they are big enough to take the mickey out of the stereotype.' Chairman of the Yorkshire Society, Keith Madeley, said: 'We're making great strides to promote the proper professional image of Yorkshire and we don't want so-called dark humour to be holding us back.","Former Prime Minister Harold Wilson, actress Diana Rigg and Nora Batty from Last of the Summer Wine also feature on the t-shirt ."
"By . Chris Parsons and Becky Barrow . Last updated at 4:49 PM on 14th February 2012 . Britain's soaring cost of living which crippled families last year has come to a halt, with the rate of inflation plunging last month, official figures revealed today. The consumer prices index measure of inflation fell from 4.2 per cent in December to 3.6 per cent in January. Economists predict it is likely to keep on dropping for the rest of the year. The Government’s target for CPI inflation is two per cent. Pressure easing: Food price inflation dropped to a 22-month low of 1.4 per cent in January . Enlarge . But the pain continues for workers because inflation remains far above the average pay rise that they are getting. The latest figures have seen inflation fall to its lowest level in two years, including a 1.2 percentage point fall since November - although the rate is still 1 percentage point off the Government's target of 2% . Public sector workers who earn £21,000 or more are being hit by a two-year pay freeze while private sector workers are typically getting a rise of between two and three per cent. Business bosses are only expecting salaries to rise slightly from last year's 0.9 per cent increases, meaning the latest inflation figures will feel 'like a pay freeze' for many employees. Brendan Barber, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: ‘With prices still increasingtwice as fast as wages, workers are still getting poorer month-by-month while high unemployment and wage stagnation persists.’ The figures are likely to be hailed as 'proof' that the inflationary 'spike' is over, and will be welcomed by cash-strapped consumers as the cost of living begins to move in the right direction. There was some upward pressure from . clothing prices in the month as January's sales were less deep than in . 2011, after retailers brought their turn-of-the-year clearances forward . to draw in customers. Food prices were broadly flat on the month and had a slight downward impact on the overall rate of inflation. However, a softer drop in clothing and footwear prices provided some resistance to the fall in the overall rate of inflation. House prices rose slightly in England over 2011, boosted by London and the South, but fell year-on-year in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, official figures showed. Across the UK, house prices recorded a small monthly increase of 0.4 per cent in December to average £205,269 the Department for Communities and Local Government (CLG) said, but analysts warned the market remains 'soft' with low consumer confidence. Typical prices in England held steady with a modest 0.5 per cent rise over last year to £213,574, with the East, London, the South East and the South West all performing above the UK average in December. But prices fell by 8.1 per cent over 2011 in Northern Ireland to average £133,647, by 4.6 per cent in Scotland to reach £155,595, and by 1.6 per cent in Wales to stand at £145,926. London, which has had strong interest from overseas buyers, remains the English region with the highest average house price at £346,604, while the North East has the lowest typical price at £131,462. Clothing . costs fell by 4.9 per cent in January, compared with a 5.9 per cent . drop in 2011, as discounting and promotion was introduced earlier to . tempt hard-pressed consumers in the run-up to Christmas. Other . measures of inflation also fell with the retail prices index (RPI) dropping to 3.9 per cent in January from 4.8 per cent in December, its . lowest level in just under two years. Financial experts welcomed the fall in inflation as a trend which could continue into the next quarter. Professor . Michael Luger, Dean of Manchester Business School, said: 'On balance, . the news today about further declines in the rate of inflation is . welcomed. 'That decline continues a trend begun last autumn and likely to continue into the next quarter, at least. 'It . reflects the ongoing weakness of the economy which relieves pressure on . prices in general, particularly in the cost of labour. A . Treasury spokesman said:  'Inflation fell significantly in January for . the second month in a row, which is good news for family budgets. The Bank of England and other forecasters expect inflation to keep falling through this year, providing additional relief.' Despite the newly-announced decrease, Bank of England Governor Mervyn King will still have to explain to Chancellor George Osborne why the rate has yet to meet the Government's target of 2% .","CPI inflation rate has fallen 1.2% since November .

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . Last updated at 3:37 PM on 14th February 2012 . Banned: Phil Morris, a referee appointments secretary at the Manchester FA, has been given a three-month suspension . A referees' boss who made a joke about the Holocaust before a Jewish league match has been suspended by an FA panel. Phil Morris was banned from all football for three months after he told a referee who was due to oversee the Jewish league game: 'Tell them to remember the concentration camps if they give you any s***.' The remarks, made in a dressing room at Manchester United's Carrington complex, were overheard by a teenage Jewish official who was left deeply distressed and told his parents. Morris, a referee appointments secretary at the Manchester FA, was disciplined after a formal complaint was made. The complaint was passed on to senior officials at the association's London headquarters and a four-men delegation was sent to investigate. Following a hearing that was held in Manchester on Friday, Morris - from Levenshulme - was found guilty by the FA panel of using ‘abusive and/or insulting words, aggravated by race’. The charge levelled at the official is the same as breached by Liverpool striker Luis Suarez, who racially abused United defender Patrice Evra and was banned for eight matches. Morris, who has been on the FA council for 19 years, had denied breaching the rule. He has been suspended from the game until May 1 and has 14 days to appeal the decision. The remark was made while Morris was running the rule over officials who had overseen a Manchester United youth match at Carrington. An aerial shot of the Carrington training ground in Manchester. It was in one of its dressing rooms that the alleged comment was made . One of the officials is believed to have been in a rush to get changed and leave - leading Morris to ask him why. When the official said he had to referee a Manchester Jewish Soccer League (MJSL) match, Morris made the offensive remark. Morris declined to comment when contacted. Lucille Cohen, president of the Jewish Representative Council of Greater Manchester and Region, branded the remark ‘absolutely obscene’. Horrifying history: The concentration camp at Auschwitz . Colin Bridgford, chief executive of the Manchester FA, said: 'Following a hearing conducted by the FA on February 10, Manchester FA can confirm that the FA have suspended Philip Morris from all football and football activity until May 1. 'The commission considered all the evidence in relation to a charge under FA Rule E3(2) in that Mr Morris used abusive and/or insulting words aggravated by race. Mr Morris has the right to appeal in accordance with FA regulations.' Mr Bridgford added: 'Until that time we will not make further comment other than to state that the Manchester FA throughout have taken the allegations seriously and considered it appropriate for the FA to appoint the panel and hear the case independently.' Morris, himself a former referee, is involved in disciplinary hearings when amateur players from various Greater Manchester leagues appeal against red-card offences. He is a well-known figure in refereeing circles and gives talks to up-and-coming officials about implementing the laws of the game. A spokesman from the Holocaust Education Trust said: 'Such a callous reference to concentration camps is clearly an insult to victims and survivors of the Holocaust as well as any decent minded person – the FA has rightly recognised the deep offence caused by these comments.'","FA secretary makes comments in dressing room .

"By . Andy Dolan . Last updated at 9:25 AM on 14th February 2012 . After five years of watching vehicles speed through his village at up to 98mph, Kevin McCarthy decided something had to be done. Exasperated at the council’s failure to lower the speed limit or install a speed camera, he built a dummy camera on his land – and within a fortnight traffic speeds dropped. But the same council has now told the father of four he could be blamed if drivers crash while trying to slow down to avoid being ‘flashed’ by the fake device. Convincing: After the council refused a request to install a real speed camera in Ompton, Nottinghamshire, Kevin McCarthy spent £250 making his own . It has warned him he could be sued if anyone claimed they were ‘distracted or influenced by the “camera”.’ Mr McCarthy, 50, said: ‘I’ve been . told if someone causes an accident by obeying the legal speed limit . through the village, then it’s my fault. That’s madness.’ The interior . designer, who had a welder friend make the £250 device out of scrap . metal, said: ‘It’s just the job.’ Villagers in Ompton, Nottinghamshire, . have been campaigning for a 30mph speed limit ever since it was first . cut from 60mph to 40mph six years ago. Nottinghamshire County Council has . refused on the grounds that the village – a scattering of around 20 . properties along the main Newark to Ollerton road – does not meet its . criteria for the lower limit. Reprimanded: Now the district council has told Mr McCarthy that he will be responsible for any accidents caused by the fake camera . Two temporary ‘interactive’ speed signs have been placed there since the limit was originally lowered. Mr McCarthy said villagers had in the . past been on a police speed watch course, where they were taught how to . use a speed gun. ‘Once we caught somebody coming through the village at . 98mph and we regularly have cars and bikes coming through at 60 to . 70mph. ‘You can tell when somebody’s sticking to the limit because they look so slow. Fear: Mr McCarthy claims that getting out of his drive is like 'taking your life in your hands' while his wife Julie almost crashed into a lorry going 60mph . Not working: The speed limit through Ompton was cut from 60mph to 40mph six years ago, but attempts to get that lowered to 30 have failed . ‘The speed of the traffic makes it . extremely difficult to get out of my house and on to the main roads in . the morning – most think nothing of doing 60 or 70mph.’ Matters came to a head recently when . wife Julie, 52, who helps run their design business, was almost hit by a . speeding HGV as she turned out of their track. Mr McCarthy added: ‘We have a problem with speeding through this village and it’s not going to be long before it kills someone.’ The council sent an official to see . the ‘camera’, who asked him to remove it. But because the replica is on . his own land, the authority is powerless to force him. Mr McCarthy said the letter from Nottinghamshire County Council then arrived. In it, the district highways manager . wrote: ‘I fully appreciate your reluctance to remove the “camera”. However I must reiterate that if an accident occurred and anyone claimed . they were distracted or influenced by the “camera” I believe you would . be liable for civil action.’ Councillor Richard Jackson, the . county council’s cabinet member for transport and highways, said: ‘We . agree that the camera is having an effect on reducing speed. ‘However, we do have concerns that, . without the correct warning signs, it is a potential hazard as it is . causing motorists to brake suddenly.’ He said speed cameras had to be . properly positioned with correct warning signs, and added: ‘We fully . understand the concerns of residents in Ompton... and we are hoping to . put in a permanent interactive speed sign in the near future.’","Kevin McCarthy built £250 camera after driver did 98mph in 40 zone .

Survivor: Albert Freeborn, pictured arriving at today's inquest, parachuted to safety after the RAF plane collided with his glider . A glider pilot today told how he parachuted to safety after colliding mid-air with an RAF aircraft in a crash which killed a teenage air cadet and his instructor. Nicholas Rice, 15, and RAF reservist Flight Lieutenant Mike Blee, 62, died when their two-seater Tutor plane collided with the glider piloted by Albert Freeborn near Abingdon, Oxfordshire. The duo's plane plummeted towards the earth and crashed in a field after the June 2009 collision, but Mr Freeborn today told how he scrambled from his stricken glider and parachuted to safety. Mr Freeborn, 29, told an inquest he . flew from Sherborne, Dorset over Oxfordshire when he heard a propeller . sound which indicated a plane was 'very close to him'. He . said: 'It has to be quite close, if you hear the sound of an engine . propeller. It’s very audible, and alarming as well, because you know it . has to be very close. 'I . looked left and down, saw the Tutor very, very close beneath me, then . about a second later, to my disbelief, it began to rotate, and rose up . towards me. 'At the time of the impact, my head was knocked through into the canopy, which shattered. 'The glider pitched nose-down, looking . at the ground. I decided I should abandon the glider, and with my left . hand opened the canopy, by which time the glider was inverted, it was . upside down. 'My weight was supported by the straps at this point. Mr Freeborn, who holds a private pilot's licence said there had been 'very good' flying conditions on the day of the collision. He added:'With my right hand I released the straps, I was helped to some extent by gravity, and when I was out of the glider, pulled the ring, and the parachute started to deploy. Tragic: Cadet Nicholas Rice, 15, left, and RAF Lieutenant Mike Blee, 62, right, both died when their plane went down in Oxfordshire . 'I was aware of the trainer and the glider beneath me, the glider was like a sycamore leaf falling to the ground, then the trainer came into view, not very far away from me, it looked like the engine was still on full power, and there was a trail of smoke. 'The glider landed beneath me and I saw the Tutor impact into a field of crop.' Mr Freeborn, from Porchester, Hampshire, landed with just a few cuts and bruises in a field half a mile away form the wreckage.

The night before his February 4 breakout game against the New Jersey Nets, New York Knicks phenomenon Jeremy Lin found himself homeless. The sofa where he usually slept at his brother Joshua's Lower East Side New York City apartment was taken -- there was a party that night there. So Lin shacked up at the modest White Planes, New York, home of teammate Landry Fields. And crashed on his coach, a simple brown sofa. The couch is now one of the most famous pieces of furniture in NBA history. The next day, Lin, 23, captured the hearts of New Yorkers and the attention of basketball fans around the country with his explosive play -- a career-high 25 points, five rebounds and seven assists. He's gone from sitting on the bench to the Knicks' starting lineup as the team has gone on a five-game winning streak. And it all began on this couch. Famous couch: Jeremy Lin crashed here, at Landry Fields' apartment, before his stunning performance against the New Jersey Nets . Breakout performance: Lin has become an overnight sensation for his explosive play on the court since the game against the New Jersey Nets last week .

After his stunning performance against the New Jersey Nets, Lin told reporters about his accommodations the prior night: 'Thank you to Landry for hosting me. I think I might just move in with him,' he said.

Lin's digs are a bit humble, compared to the multimillion-dollar digs that have become the norm for some of his teammates and the players he has beaten this month. For example, fellow Knick Carmelo Anthony has a three year contract worth $65 million. He's reportedly renting a condo in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood for $22,000 a month. He and his wife LaLa Vazquez bought a $2 million 6,500-square-foot home in Los Angeles with 4 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms, an infinity edge pool and a cabana in the backyard. But that's a pittance compared to the $12 million he spent in 2007 for a sprawling 21,000-square-foot mansion in Denver when he was playing for the Nuggets. He reportedly sold it for a loss of nearly $6 million when he moved to New York. Luxury: Amare Stoudemire pays $37,000 a month for his condo at 99 Jane Steet .

Stoudemire will rake in $99.7 million over the life of his five-year contract with the Knicks. None of that compares to Kobe Bryant, however, who makes more than $25 million a year.

"Leonora Rustamova wrote the book to encourage literacy among Year 11 pupils . By . Lauren Paxman . Last updated at 2:44 PM on 13th February 2012 . A teacher who was controversially sacked after she wrote a racy novel inspired by her students has won a three-year battle to clear her name. Mum-of-one Leonora Rustamova, 41, known to pupils as Miss Rusty, was sacked after her book - which made sexual references and drew comparisons between teenagers and 'gorgeous Mr Gay UK finalists' - was published online and attracted nationwide attention. She said the book, Stop! Don't Read This, was written to encourage literacy among Year 11 pupils - but the head and governors of Calder High School in Mytholmroyd, West Yorkshire, were less than impressed and fired the teacher in 2009. Vindicated: Leonora Rustanmova was controversially sacked after she wrote a racy novel inspired by her students . Miss Rusty, who had been at the school for 11 years, is now celebrating  after being cleared by of any misdemeanours by the General Teaching Council (GTC) - which she hopes will help her win an industrial tribunal. She said: 'It has been an awful time. I got the letter from the General Teaching Council on Saturday and it took 15 minutes to summon up the courage to open the envelope. 'The council said it had re-examined all the facts in the case and decided there was no case to answer, so they are taking it no further. Inspirational: Mrs Rustamova's sacking from Calder High School, near Hebden Bridge, prompted demonstrations by pupils and a campaign by parents to have her reinstated . Stop! Don't Read This contains many sexual references and makes light of the pupils’ bad behaviour. One pupil is described as flirting with Miss Rusty, while she says she would do anything for a smile from another. Miss Rusty's character says: ‘It’s getting harder and harder to see them just as kids.’ Two characters, who are sunbathing topless, are described as ‘looking like gorgeous Mr Gay UK finalists in an area of Britain where there is some pretty stiff competition’. Later in the novel she describes how pupils practise ‘orgasmic moans’ to entertain themselves. These are described as sounding like ‘the soundtrack to teenage gay porn’. The book ends with the boys being labelled heroes after revealing a drugs store beneath the school and reporting it to police – but not before a case of cocaine goes missing. Miss Rusty says: ‘I suppose the boys had earned a hell of a ritzy summer holiday.’ 'It had been referred to them as a matter of course when I was sacked, supposedly for a serious disciplinary breach. 'This . has been hanging over me for three years and stopped me doing the job I . loved. I never wanted to do anything else but teach. 'I loved every minute of my career, working with young people. 'It has been a dreadful time but now I feel so relieved and there have been great celebrations in the Rustamova household all weekend. 'I still love teaching and who knows, I may well go back. But I have concerns over the problems in state schools, where there is too much power invested in the head and the governors. 'This thing has set me on a new course and I have two great jobs, working with adult education students in Leeds and with students at the University of Huddersfield. 'Now I hope that the Teaching Council ruling will help me in my fight with the Employment Tribunal. 'I won an appeal against their findings and I hope when the next hearing comes along they will consider the Teaching Council verdict.' Governors accused Miss Rustamova - who was on a salary of £34,000 - of bringing the school into disrepute, undermining its authority and demeaning pupils and parents. An appeal against her dismissal was rejected, despite considerable support from colleagues, pupils and parents. As a result of her ordeal, Miss Rustamova's marriage collapsed. She claimed the book, which was peppered with expletives, was an innovative way of getting her pupils interested in their work. It named several teachers and featured five year 11 pupils - all real students and referred to as Miss Rusty's favourites. The book was finally published in paperback last summer by Bluemoose Books, based in Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire.",Leonora Rustamova wrote the book to encourage literacy among Year 11 pupils .
"By . Charles Walford . Last updated at 9:14 AM on 14th February 2012 . This is the footage that big cat experts claim proves a jet black leopard is stalking the British countryside. The grainy film shows what appears to be a 6ft-long beast slinking menacingly around a field near Stroud, Gloucestershire. It was captured just three miles from Woodchester National Park - where earlier this year the mutilated carcass of a roe deer was found by a dog walker. Despite the low quality of the never-before-seen footage, enthusiasts insist it is the 'conclusive' evidence that there are big cats on the prowl in the wild in Britain. Scroll down for video of the 'Wildcat of Woodchester' Experts say the grainy footage definitely shows a 6ft long cat . The big cat skulked around the field before darting off into the woods about three miles from where a deer was found mutilated in January . Experts say the grainy footage definitely shows a 6ft long cat . And they believe the particular animal in this  footage shot by by Coryn Memory is the mysterious 'Wildcat of Woodchester', which has been spotted dozens of times in recent the years. Big cat expert Frank Tunbridge, 65, from Gloucestershire, said: 'I think this footage is pretty much conclusive. 'It is the best footage of a big cat ever filmed in the UK - showing what we believe is a slim, young looking black leopard. 'You can tell by the size of the animal - it is huge. We think it is about 2ft tall up to the shoulder and 6ft long including the tail, which is way bigger than a domestic cat. 'It also walks just like a big cat and has an extremely long tail. There have been literally hundreds of reports of big cat sightings in this area for years. This could just be the tip of the iceberg.' Ms Memory says that this footage was not the first time she had seen the cat, and said she had spotted it on five previous occasions. She first spotted a large black animal crossing the field near her house in Thrupp, near Stroud, in July 2009. It . again appeared again the following evening and she searched online to try and work out what it might be. It was then she discovered the stories about a large . panther-like animal roaming the Cotswolds. Coryn Memory, 45, captured the footage after sighting the big cat near her home on a number of occasions . The latest footage shows a similar large black animal to this one spotted in a field in north-west Wiltshire . Later that year she saw it again . several times, and took some shaky photographs of the cat in the snow, as well as images of cat footprints. The intrigued single mum then got in touch with wildlife explorer Mr Tunbridge - who loaned her a camcorder to use the next time she spotted the beast. In July 2010 she finally caught the animal on film after spotting it skulking in a field 300 yards from her home. Balancing the handheld camera on a pile of CDs, she managed to film if for ten minutes as the beast stalked across the grass. It was captured running and walking, before slinking off into the undergrowth near woods, near Rodborough Common. Mother-of-two Ms Memory who works as a teaching assistant in a special school, said: 'I was fascinated just watching it walking around the field. 'I was not frightened at all - just excited to see it and finally get it on camera. It was only about 300 yards away. 'I believe he was looking for voles . and mice in the short grass after it had been cut. At one stage a fox . was in the same shot so you could compare the difference in size. 'The ""Wildcat of Woodchester"" was spotted only just a few miles away from here so I do believe it could be the same animal. Ms Memory's footage was taken not far from where a number of animals were slaughtered, apparently by a wild big cat . 'It . looked quite calm and not the snarling big cats you usually see in . pictures. I haven't seen it since but I now really believe that these . creatures are out there. 'I had never really heard of any big cats in Britain before I started spotting this one - now I know of loads of people that have seen it around here.' Ms Memory, who lives with son Ashley, 20, and daughter Emilie, ten, handed the footage to Mr Tunbridge, who approached wildlife filmmaker Mark Fletcher and the pair began work on a documentary about the elusive creatures. The team used imaging techniques to estimate the size of the black cat as 2ft high to the shoulder and 6ft long, including a 2ft tail. They finally decided to release the pictures yesterday - after the devastated carcasses of three roe deer and three wallabies were found nearby last month. DNA was taken from the first deer, which was found by a dog walker on January 4 this year.The body had all of its vital organs missing and had its snout severed - the hallmarks of a panther-like kill. One of three wallabies found devoured on farmland in the Cotswolds last month. DNA tests suggested it had been devoured by a fox . The carcass of one of the deer killed last month is examined to allow experts to carry out the DNA test . Another deer carcass was found by a dog walker between Whiteway and Redcomb, near Cirencester - ten miles away - on January 10. A third roe deer body was found at a development in Cooper's Edge, near Gloucester, days later. Three wallabies, part of a private . collection, were also found dead by their devastated owner on January 6, . two days after his first kill at Woodchester Park. But a team of scientists, lead by Dr Robin Allaby of Warwick University, failed to find any big cat DNA on the carcass . Dr Allaby, associate professor . at the university's School of Life Sciences, said: 'We did not detect cat DNA on either deer . carcass. 'Other than deer, by far the strongest genetic signal we found on the Woodchester Park carcass was from a fox. 'That fox DNA was found on the ribs, legs and plucking sites from the Woodchester deer carcass. 'On the second deer carcass we found . canid DNA. A more detailed analysis is underway to pin down the canid . species but our expectation is that that will also be fox DNA.'","Grainy footage shows cat-like creature skulking in a field .

The search for a 30-year-old accountant who went missing after an argument with her fiance has been called off after investigators found no leads in a forest where her burnt-out SUV was found. Dara Lee Watson was reported missing on Friday, just hours before her fiance David Hedrick, 34, was found dead in their Mount Pleasant, South Carolina home by police officers. Neighbours had reported hearing loud bangs before the business owner's body was found. Scroll down for video . Missing: Dara Lee Watson, a 30-year-old accountant, was last seen by her . mother in North Carolina on Monday 6. Her fiance David Hedrick told . police they had an argument that night and she left on Tuesday . Hedrick had previously told Mount Pleasant police officers the pair had argued on Monday night and Watson had left their home on Tuesday morning, and he had not seen her since. Police found Hedrick dead inside the home on Saturday at 12.45 a.m. The coroner's office will not confirm how he died, telling WCIV the incident is under investigation. More than 100 officers combed the Francis Marion National Forest on Saturday and Sunday after her white GMC Envoy was found there on Friday. They were joined by Watson's relatives. 'They just wanted to get a feel for the . area - where the vehicle was located and just get a feel . for the area of the search and the magnitude of what was going on with . the search,' Charleston County Sheriff's Office spokesman Major James Brady told WCIV . Happier times: Mr Hedrick, pictured with Miss Watson, was found dead at their home on Saturday morning . Fears: Officers found Miss Watson's burnt-out SUV in a forest but have found no clues to her whereabouts . Search groups turned over leaves in . several miles of wooded area, but the search ended around 3.30 p.m. with . no results, WCIV reported. 'We came out to expand the search that we initially started yesterday,' Brady said. They were looking for 'any evidence, any clues of anything that might tie into the case for the missing person, and to give it a better opportunity to search the areas a little bit deeper than yesterday'. Brady told the news channel that search efforts would not continue in the area unless there were new leads. Speaking to ABC4, Mount Pleasant . police chief Harry Sewell added they were uncertain how long Watson's . SUV had been in the woods. No evidence: Mount Pleasant police have called off a search in the woods after they found no leads . Found: Police are uncertain how long Miss Watson's SUV was in the woods. It has been taken away for investigation . 'The vehicle was towed and is being searched for evidence,' he added. 'We're just trying our best to locate this young lady. We've had dogs searching the area looking for bodies. We've been looking for evidence. We don't really know what we're looking for.' Watson's mother - the last person apart from Hedrick to see the missing woman - saw her daughter on Monday in Boone, North Carolina. Police told ABC4 that Watson's mobile phone was last used on Wednesday February 8 at 7:30 p.m. in Mount Pleasant, according to cell tower information. Together: It is believed Watson and Hedrick had been a couple since 2009 and lived together in North Carolina . In love: The couple had a fight on the night of Monday 6. Watson left the home the next day, Hedrick told police . Watson's boss had also received a text . message that day saying that she was fine - but the 30-year-old has not . been heard from since. Police stressed that they are still treating the case as a search for a missing person. Even though the missing person's report and apparent suicide occurred within hours of each other, police have said it is too soon to link the incidents. 'At this point it's an active investigation,' Sewell said. 'We're trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together. Nothing is more important than finding Watson.' Scene: Hedrick was found dead in his $410,000 home on Saturday. Neighbours said they had heard gunshots . Hedrick owned local bail bond company . Palmetto Surety. In 2010, he bought the $410,000 house on North Creek . Drive where his body was found, according to the Post and Courier. Watson, who also lived at the home, met Watson in April 2009 at the Heritage Golf Tournament in Hilton Head, according to her Facebook page.

"By . Ted Thornhill . Last updated at 3:44 PM on 10th February 2012 . An incredible insight into how a major earthquake changed the landscape – down to a few inches – has been made possible thanks to cutting edge LiDAR scanning technology. It stands for 'light detection and ranging' and involves bouncing a stream of laser pulses off the ground, which gives scientists an incredibly detailed image of the landscape. Luckily for a team of U.S, Mexican and Chinese geologists, a LiDAR scan had already been made of an area in Mexico hit by an earthquake, giving them the opportunity to create the most comprehensive ‘before and after’ image of such a disaster zone ever created. Mexico earthquake LidAR: Blue shows where ground surface moved down, red shows upward movement compared to the previous survey . How the aftermath looked on the ground: A crack right across a road near Mexicali following the huge earthquake . ‘We can learn so much about how earthquakes work by studying fresh fault ruptures,’ said Michael Oskin, geology professor at the University of California, Davis, and lead researcher. The team, working with the National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping, flew over an area near Mexicali, northern Mexico, that was hit by a magnitude 7.2 event in April 2010 and scanned it with LiDAR. The researchers were able to make a detailed scan over about 140 square miles in less than three days, Oskin said. Oskin said that they knew the area had been mapped with LiDAR in 2006 by the Mexican government. Powerful: The quake collapsed a church in Mexicali . When the earthquake occurred, Oskin and Ramon Arrowsmith at Arizona State University applied for and got funding from the National Science Foundation to carry out an immediate aerial survey to compare the results. But the LiDAR survey further reveals warping of the ground surface adjacent to faults that previously could not easily be detected, Oskin said. For example, it revealed the folding above the Indiviso fault running beneath agricultural fields in the floodplain of the Colorado River. ‘This would be very hard to see in the field,’ Oskin said. Team members used the ‘virtual reality’ facility at UC Davis's W. M. Keck Center for Active Visualization in Earth Sciences to handle and view the data from the survey. By comparing pre- and post-earthquake surveys, they could see exactly where the ground moved and by how much. The survey revealed deformation around the system of small faults that caused the earthquake, and allowed measurements that provide clues to understanding how these multi-fault earthquakes occur. The 2010 Mexicali earthquake did not occur on a major fault, like the San Andreas, but ran through a series of smaller faults in the Earth's crust. These minor faults are common around major faults but are ‘underappreciated,’ Oskin said. ‘This sort of earthquake happens out of the blue,’ he said. The new LiDAR survey shows how seven of these small faults came together to cause a major earthquake, Oskin said. Ken Hudnut, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey and coauthor on the paper, made the first use of airborne LiDAR about 10 years ago to document surface faulting from the Hector Mine earthquake. Ready and waiting: A LiDAR 'trap' has been set for the San Andreas fault zone, which produced an earthquake in 1906 that reduced large parts of San Francisco to rubble . But ‘pre-earthquake’ data were lacking. Since then, NCALM has carried out LiDAR scans of the San Andreas system and other active faults in the western U.S, thereby setting a trap for future earthquakes, he said. ‘In this case, fortunately, our CICESE colleagues had set such a trap, and this earthquake fell right into it and became the first ever to be imaged by ‘before’ and ‘after'‘ LiDAR. It is a thrill for me to be on the team that reached this important milestone,’ Hudnut said.",Detailed image shows how magnitude 7.2 quake in Mexico affected the landscape .

Remorseless: Liam Warriner today pleaded guilty to a charge of public nuisance at Brisbane Magistrates Court. He was fined AUS$750 (£510) for 'mooning the Queen in the city last October . Guest of honour: The Queen, accompanied by Prince Philip and Queensland Premier Anna Bligh, walks down a slipway to board a cruiser on the Brisbane River. Shortly beforehand, police said the monarch was 'mooned' by Warriner as she passed him in her motorcade . Warriner dropped his trousers and ran . alongside the motorcade for 50 yards with an Australian flag clasped . between the cheeks of his buttocks. It is not known if the Queen, who was travelling in a limousine with a police escort, saw the incident. The court heard that Warriner told . police he mooned the monarch as a political protest to show his contempt . for her and elitist groups. Magistrate Anne Thacker was not amused by his behaviour. She said: 'This is a civil society and when a . lot of people gather in one place the grouping means there is a . vulnerable position if even one person like yourself doesn't behave in a . civil manner.' Warriner lawyer's described the mooning as 'low level stuff'. Police had asked for the maximum fine of $1,000 (£678). Outside court, Warriner turned his anger on the media and high-profile people. He described the media, which has given prominence to his case as it has proceeded through the courts, as 'evil'. The Queen and Prince Philip prepare to set off down the river to view areas of Brisbane left devastated after the floods of January last year . Well-wishers: Thousands of people line the Brisbane River in the city's South Bank to wave to the Queen during the royal visit . He encouraged the Occupy movement to 'rock on' and said he would 'moon' President Obama if he came to Australia.

Warriner appeared unconcerned about being charged. 'Any self-important, self-propagating elitist... I will happily bare my buttocks,' he said outside court. Sergeant Troy Newman told the court . that Warriner had shown a selfish attitude to score a political point . during a formal and respectful occasion. An unrepentant Warriner said he was 'a proud anti-monarchist'. 'What's uncivilised about it?' he said of his buttocks protest. 'We come into the world naked.' He said people wrongly likened the .

He claimed that police had called him . a 'd*******' a few times - but denied that people would agree with the . officers who questioned him after the incident.

The EU could be to blame for Europe's growing obesity epidemic, say scientists. A study found that because of lower import tariffs, the 27 member states have higher supplies of red meat and dairy compared to non-members. The Union members also place lower prices on calorie-laden goods, increasing the risk of obesity. A recent Eurostat report found that more than half of the EU population are now overweight or obese. During the new study, researchers looked at dietary habits in Portugal pre-and post-EU membership. Before the country became a member state in 1986 the Portuguese ate local produce, with diets rich in fish and olive oil. However, according to their analysis, after joining the EU, many ditched traditional foods and turned to cheap meat, cheese and grains that . flooded in from other member states. Commenting on the findings, lead researcher Pedro Marques-Vidal from Lausanne University in Switzerland said: 'After entering the EU, the prices of meat and milk products were reduced in Germany, Italy, France, and Portugal. 'As a result of these lower prices consumption increased and the EU citizens put on weight.' The study has been backed by other scientists, including Switzerland's Preventative Medicine Centre. David Fah, from Zurich University, said that the findings highlight potential risks of joining the EU.  Switzerland is not an EU member and currently . has one of the lowest obesity rates in Europe at around 8 per cent. He said: The Swiss eat more vegetables, fish, olive oil and less red meat. 'If we joined the EU, the consumption of red meat would increase.' The 27 member states were found to have higher supplies of red meat and dairy compared to non-members . In the late 1990s, the wheat price was at a record low driven down by inexpensive fuel and taxpayers' farm subsidies in the EU. This spread of cheap food encouraged obesity levels to soar to one billion for the first time. An EU Environment and Health . Commission spokesperson Jo Leinen said: 'We know obesity is a problem in . the EU - we have named it a threat to the public health.' Obesity is recognised as a global epidemic and the most prevalent metabolic disease worldwide. A person is considered obese if they are carrying too much body fat for their height and sex, demonstrating a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or greater. The Foresight report, has predicted . that by 2025, nearly half of men and over a third of women will be . obese, increasing the risk of chronic diseases, including type 2 . diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension and stroke, and certain . forms of cancer.","27 member states have high supplies of meat and dairy .

Attack: Gary Hindley, 56, leaves Thames Magistrates' Court today after being given a 12-week suspended sentence . The parents of a six-year-old girl who lost her ear when she was savaged by a dog reacted with fury yesterday after its owner was spared jail. Gary Hindley, 56, walked free from court after being handed a 12-week suspended sentence and ordered to pay just £350 compensation for the ‘sustained and horrific attack’ in which his Staffordshire bull terrier bit off most of her right ear. Yesterday the victim’s parents described the sentence as an insult. The little girl was testing her Christmas presents – a telescope and binoculars – on a family day out to Epping Forest, Essex, with her parents and younger brother when the attack happened on January 21. Yesterday, in a statement read to Thames Magistrates’ Court, the mother said: ‘The dog was on my little girl, standing on her, with his head buried into her. ‘My daughter was screaming, “Get it off, get it off”. I came round the back and tried to grab it but I couldn’t get it off. I threw myself over her body trying to do everything in my power to protect her. My daughter was screaming and I was trying to grab the dog around the middle but it was pure muscle and I could not move it.’ The dog only let go when her  husband punched it. As the dog  was pulled back, it sank its teeth  into his wife’s scalp and ripped her hair out. After the two-minute attack the child, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was taken to hospital suffering head and neck injuries. Scene: The girl's family were testing out a telescope she had been given for Christmas in Pole Hill, Chingford (pictured), when the Staffordshire Bull Terrier struck . Scene: A PCSO patrols close to where the Staffordshire Bull Terrier attacked the girl on January 21 . Escaped jail: Hindley leaves the court today with his face covered after he avoided a prison sentence. He was ordered to pay the girl £450 compensation as part of his punishment . She has since undergone cosmetic surgery and faces further operations to reconstruct her ear. District Judge Robert Roscoe . admonished Hindley, who lived near the scene of the attack, for . vanishing after giving the girl’s father a false address. Hindley, . unemployed, who had only had the 16-month-old pet for four months, . handed himself into the police the following morning. Yesterday he was given a 12-week jail . sentence suspended for two years. He was banned from owning any animal . for ten years after admitting allowing his dog to be dangerously out of . control in a public place and causing injury. He was ordered to pay £350 in . compensation and £100 court costs. He must carry out 200 hours of unpaid . work and wear an electronic tag. The judge also ordered that the dog, named Buddy, be destroyed. Judge Roscoe told Hindley: ‘You were . not doing your duty to protect other people in the park and it resulted . in a sustained and horrific attack on a child.’ But outside court, the girl’s father . said: ‘Where is the deterrent? Where is the justice? How is this going . to stop it happening again, it’s an absolute insult. ‘My six-year-old daughter screams in pain for an hour every day while we’re changing her dressing. ‘If he had a knife in his hands and . used it on my daughter, he would have been locked away for a long time. What is the difference to what he did with his dog?’ Probe: A couple talk to Police Community Support Officers as they investigate the mauling in Chingford, Essex. Today Hindley escaped jail .

The man accused of killing his new bride as they honeymooned in Australia did so to profit from it, and displayed little distress as others tried to resuscitate her, a court heard yesterday. Gabe Watson, 34, drowned Tina Watson, 26, in 2003 by turning off her air supply, prosecutors say. But defence lawyers insisted as his Alabama trial began on Tuesday that her death was an accident. He thought he could collect $210,000 from a life insurance and travel policy, and it is also alleged that Watson tried to get her diamond engagement ring back. In court: Gabe Watson, with wife Kim, wait in the courtroom for jury selection to begin at the trial on Monday . Preparing: Gabe Watson, right, talks with his attorney Michael Hanle at the Mel Bailey Criminal Justice Center in Birmingham, Alabama, on Monday. He is accused of killing newly-wed bride Tina Watson . Australian police didn't believe his varying tales about what happened in the Great Barrier Reef, prosecutors said. Prosecutor Andrew Arrington told the jury: 'The problem is all the times the defendant has lied. Why is he lying?' 'Tina trusted her husband,’ Mr Arrington told the court, while Watson’s new wife Kim . Lewis, who bears a strong resemblance to Tina, sat listening. ‘She felt . safe diving with him.’ Jewellery: This was the ring being worn by Gabe Watson's new wife Kim outside court on Monday . Watson allegedly turned off his wife's . air supply while both were underwater and held her in a bear-hug until . she lost consciousness - before turning the air back on and letting her sink. The jury of eight women and six men . looked at a haunting underwater photo taken by another diver of the . death scene. It showed Tina sprawled in deep water as Watson swam to the . surface. But Watson’s defence team claimed the . prosecution is based on ‘bumbling’ detectives in Australia believing . that a problem with a dive computer on his wrist proved he killed the . woman he loved. That mistake early in the . investigation made police wrongly see innocent actions and circumstances . as proof of a crime, defence lawyer Brett Bloomston told the court in . Birmingham, Alabama. Married again: Gabe Watson, along with his new wife Kim, prepares to enter the Mel Bailey Criminal Justice Center in Birmingham, Alabama, on Monday, ahead of jury selection for his trial . Was it murder? Gabe Watson says his wife Tina Watson died as the result of a terrible diving accident . Rather than being murdered, Tina . struggled and knocked off her husband's air supply and diving mask, . forcing him to resurface without her, Mr Bloomston said. She drowned on . her own, he said. 'Tina trusted her husband. She felt safe diving with him' Andrew Arrington, prosecuting . ‘This is a tragic case,’ Mr Bloomston . said. ‘What's even more tragic is the blame Gabe has had to live with . this last number of years.’ He added that Tina’s father was the . beneficiary on her life insurance. That policy was worth only $33,000, . not the $165,000 claimed by prosecutors, he said, and a travel policy . for $45,000 was only to cover the cost of the trip. ‘There was no . financial motive,’ Mr Bloomston said. Mr Bloomston argued that Tina Watson . contributed to her own death by waiving an orientation dive and placing . too much weight in a device meant to help her stay underwater during the . dive. Horrific death: Tina Thomas Watson is seen lying on the bottom of the sea in this chilling photo as a rescuer rushes to save her in October 2003 . Facing closure: Tommy and Cindy Thomas will finally see their former son-in-law tried for their daughter's murder when the case begins Monday in an Alabama courtroom . She panicked once during a diving . class in a flooded suburban rock quarry, Mr Bloomston said, suggesting . that she may have panicked again in the fatal dive. 'This is a tragic case. What's even more tragic is the blame Gabe has had to live with this last number of years' Brett Bloomston, defending . Mr Bloomston denied prosecution claims . that Watson was a highly trained rescue diver who should have been able . to save Tina, and instead said they were both ‘very inexperienced’ underwater. Watson initially was charged with . murder in Australia, after Tina’s body was found near Townsville, . Queensland, but he pleaded guilty to a lesser manslaughter charge and . served 18 months in prison. A grand jury in Alabama also indicted . him for capital murder as he allegedly planned his new bride's death . while still in the state. A judge granted a defence motion to have one . murder count dropped. Remarried: Gabe Watson remarried, to Kim Lewis, pictured, after being released from prison in Australia . Honeymoon Horror: The newlyweds were diving at the Great Barrier Reef off Australia when Tina died . Before Australian authorities would . release Watson to the U.S., Alabama had to agree to waive the death . penalty as a possible punishment, prosecutors said. He faces life in . prison if convicted. 'There was no financial motive' Brett Bloomston, defending . Australian authorities performed . exhaustive tests to try to recreate Tina Watson's death, which occurred . soon after the couple's wedding. A coroner’s report threw up some . interesting ideas. Gabe Watson said his wife looked . concerned seven minutes into their dive and knocked his mask off in . panic. By the time he retrieved the mask, he said Tina was sinking too . fast for him to catch her. Tina was an inexperienced diver and he . had rescue certification, the report said. The Alabama trial poses . logistical challenges, as up to a dozen witnesses will be flown in from . Australia to testify. The state of Alabama has also . subpoenaed people from California to testify about what happened that . day on a dive boat called the Spoilsport, but it's unclear how many will . take the stand.

"By . Emily Allen . Last updated at 11:27 AM on 9th February 2012 . A mother-of-two recovered from flu only to find that her accent had changed from Brummie to French. Debie Royston, 40, originally from Birmingham, suffered a series of seizures after a bad bout of the illness. It caused her to lose the ability to speak and, when her voice did come back a month later, she was shocked to discover her Brummie accent was gone in what doctors believe is a case of a rare condition known as Foreign Accent Syndrome. Debie Royston, 40, originally from Birmingham, suffered a series of seizures after a bad bout of flu and now speaks with a French accent . The syndrome leaves a person speaking in a different accent due to a brain injury, stroke or migraine - but in Mrs Royston's case none of these have yet been diagnosed. Now she feels as if she has lost her identity and is struggling to come to terms with her new voice. She said: 'I had a bad seizure and when it stopped my husband asked if I was okay. I had words in my head but my mouth wouldn’t work. 'Over the next month, I had to learn to speak again. Only when I did, I could hear a different sound, not my Brummie accent. 'Everybody said I sounded French but I’ve never even been there.' She added: 'Every . day I wake up and think: ''don’t speak'' because in my silence I am Deb . but something will happen and the silence is broken. You’re a stranger . again.' Medics were baffled by Mrs Royston's condition after tests came back clear so she was referred to a speech therapist. Debi did have a Brummie accent (Birmingham is pictured) Foreign Accent Syndrome affects just 60 people worldwide and there is currently no known cure . This diagnosis was confirmed in March last year when she was sent to see an expert in speech and language at Newcastle University. Foreign Accent Syndrome affects just 60 people worldwide and there is currently no known cure. She said: 'People speak to me and say: ‘where are you from?’ and when I say Birmingham, they look at me like I’m lying about it. 'They say: ‘no, you’re French.' When Mrs Royston, who now lives in Gillingham, Kent, developed flu like symptoms, she put it down to a virus and assumed she would soon recover. But over the next few weeks her symptoms worsened so she went to see her GP. She said: 'He wasn’t very helpful. 'I tried to carry on as normal but it became a struggle. My head was pounding. It felt like I had been out drinking heavily the night before.' The syndrome is caused when the brain is damaged through a stroke, tumour or a trauma or it can be caused by some psychological reasons like depression or major psychoses. It affects just 60 people worldwide and there is no known cure. People who suffer from it find it distressing as voice is integral to our identity. The changes to the person's speech sound like a foreign or dialectical accent. For most people sounding foreign is temporary but for a small number of people the changes are permanent. When her face started drooping her worried husband, Andy, 41, took her took her to the Medway Maritime Hospital. After a series of tests she had a seizure and she had spasms for about 20 minutes. Doctors couldn’t find anything medically wrong with her so they discharged her while she waited for an appointment for another brain scan. However, the seizures began again - up to 10 a day - and she was rushed back to hospital where she suffered another one while waiting to see a neurologist which left her unable to speak. Following a month of intensive therapy she began to speak again but her voice was unrecognisable to family and friends. She said: 'I was so happy I could talk but when I started to say words I was thinking this is not how I speak. It didn’t sound like me. 'I didn’t think any more about it until I bumped into my neighbour outside. Her grandson, who’s three, was there and he asked me why I was speaking like I was from France.' Debi says she has never been to France and cannot understand why her accent sounds French . Since her illness she has been forced to give up her job as a teaching assistant and Andy, who is a stock control manager for a music distribution company, had to work from home for six months to help care for her. She has also left her with muscle weakness and she needs the aid of a walking stick. Professor Nick Miller, an expert in motor speech disorders from Newcastle University, who diagnosed Debie, said: 'Foreign Accent Syndrome can be caused by either a neurological problem, such as an injury to the brain, or for some psychological reasons like depression or major psychoses might be the origin. 'Many people who experience changes to their brain may end up with speech difficulties. Usually listeners hear these as disordered speech, but for a small subgroup, listeners perceive their speech as foreign. 'This is because the subtle changes that the listener picks up are reminiscent of a particular foreign accent. 'The exact causes of the speech changes in Debie’s case are not entirely sure. We have not pinned it down yet. She appears to have suffered some seizures, but other factors may be present. 'For most people, sounding foreign is a temporary phase of a few days, weeks or months. 'The number of people left with a permanent foreign sounding accent are relatively few.'","Debie Royston suffered seizures before accent change .

A 25-year-old woman who had a baby only a week ago was repeatedly raped and beaten by a burglar Sunday night while her newborn lay on a bed beside her. Coral Springs, Florida police say dispatchers heard the assault taking place after the 25-year-old woman called 911 on her cell phone. Police set up a perimeter around the neighbourhood and arrested 19-year-old Gary L. Holmes. Scroll down for video . Violent Crime: Gary L. Holmes, 19, allegedly broke into a Coral Springs home and raped a 25-year-old new mother . Quiet neighbourhood: Police say Holmes entered a house on this sleepy neighbourhood in Coral Springs . The new mother had left the sliding glass door of her Coral Gables home open, perhaps to let the cool night breeze in, letting the man enter the house. The man wasn’t expecting anyone to be home, Coral Springs police spokesman Sgt Dave Kirkland told CBS Miami. ‘The homeowner was surprised,’ he said,’ and he opted to attack her at that point. The police report shows that Holmes demanded her valuables and then pushed the woman into her bedroom, NBC Miami reported. Holmes, who had a knife on him, allegedly attacked the mother, raping her repeatedly, punching her, and cutting her hands, all while her newborn lay nearby. According to police, the mother managed to dial 911 on her cell phone at some point during the attack. Though the phone was battered away, Pompano officers were able to trace the call by triangulating the signal. Tracking: Police were able to triangulate the first 911 call and were in the area by the time the woman called from her landline . Stunned: Neighbour Jamie Levine witnessed Holmes' arrest and said the world has changed, and it was frightening this happened . Dispatchers received a second call some time later from the woman saying that someone had broken into her house and sexually assaulted her, Sgt Kirkland said. Officers who were already in the area because of the first 911 call were able to canvas the neighbourhood. They found Holmes wearing a bloody shirt and holding a knife to his neck. 'Even though she wasn’t able to . communicate, she kept an open line, and that was instrumental because it . allowed dispatchers to triangulate a close proximity to where the call . came from.' -Sgt Dave Kirkland . Once police persuaded Holmes to drop the knife, they arrested him. Sgt Kirkland lauded the mother’s quick thinking to call 911. ‘Even though she wasn’t able to communicate, she kept an open line, and that was instrumental because it allowed dispatchers to triangulate a close proximity to where the call came from,’ he told WSVN.com. She has been treated for minor injuries, Sgt Kirkland said. He added that her infant was unharmed in the attack. Meanwhile, Holmes faces three counts of armed sexual battery and two counts of burglary of an occupied dwelling. He is being held without bond. Ashamed: Holmes' grandmother, 76, talked to reporters but would not appear on camera and said she was shocked her grandson would commit such a heinous crime . One resident of the quiet neighbourhood witnessed the police arresting Holmes and was shocked that the violent crime rattled the close-knit community. Jamie Levine told WSVN said 'the world has changed way too much,' adding: 'this is frightening.' Holmes’ grandmother told CBS Miami that she was shocked her church-going grandson would commit such a crime. ‘I raised nine head of kids and have 15 grandkids and he ain’t had no business doing that,’ the 76-year-old grandmother said. ‘How dare he to that. He ain’t no poor person or nothing like that because we give him everything he needs,’ she told WSVN.com. Sgt Kirkland told the Miami Herald that this was a ‘crime of opportunity,’ as many Florida residents often leave windows and doors open during pleasant weather.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:45 AM on 15th February 2012 . Jeffrey Maxwell, 59, faces charges of kidnapping and aggravated sexual assault . A Texas woman who prosecutors say was tortured for 12 days seemed to be in shock as she spoke to authorities following her rescue, initially defending the man accused of hanging her from a deer-skinning device and chaining her to a bed, according to a recording of the interview played at his trial on Tuesday. The woman is heard telling an investigator that Jeffrey Allan Maxwell, her former neighbour, told her he'd been hired to kill her. During the rambling interview after she was found last March, she also said some of her relatives wanted to harm her over a property dispute and urged the investigator to arrest them. She said she didn't want to get Maxwell in trouble because 'he's been good to me,' but later said he was 'mean.' Maxwell, 59, is accused of abducting the woman from her rural home, driving her some 100 miles away to his house in Corsicana, about 50 miles south of Dallas, and holding her captive for nearly two weeks. Maxwell is charged with aggravated kidnapping and two counts of aggravated sexual assault. If convicted, he would face up to life in prison. Testimony is expected to resume on Wednesday. In the audio recording, an investigator repeatedly yet gently questions the 62-year-old woman before she said Maxwell hit her with a rolling pin and tied her up March 1 inside her Parker County home. She said she briefly escaped and ran down the road before he caught her, pulled out his gun and forced her into the back seat of his vehicle. She said Maxwell was mad when they . arrived at his home, and he hit her with a whip and put her wrists in . some type of device that hoisted her off the ground. Authorities have . said it was Maxwell's homemade device for skinning deer, and photographs . shown to the jury depict a long, thin wooden board with hooks attached. A cable was attached to the garage ceiling. Maxwell, seen here last year, allegedly tortured the woman, who used to live near him and on whom he had reportedly had a crush . 'I don't know what it is but he pulled me up in the air,' the woman is heard saying on the audiotape. 'It scared me to death.' She also said Maxwell told her his . fingerprints were all over her house so he would have to torch it — . which authorities say he did two days later. Sgt Ricky Montgomery, a Parker County . sheriff's investigator, told jurors that authorities conducted a . massive ground search after fire officials didn't find the woman's body . in the rubble of her burned home near Weatherford, which is about 60 . miles west of Dallas. He said authorities had few leads . until a neighbour reported seeing an unfamiliar blue car drive by twice . on the day of the fire, and bank records showed no activity on the . woman's account — except for a $500 check recently cashed by Maxwell. Investigators later found out that Maxwell had a blue car and once lived . in that area. When authorities went to Corsicana on . March 12, Maxwell answered the door and said he was alone — but then . the woman ran out and said, 'I'm here! I'm here!' Montgomery testified. She had a broken arm, head injury and multiple bruises, an emergency . room doctor testified. The victim's house and car were destroyed in a fire. Her family alerted authorities when no trace of her was found in the ruins . Earlier Tuesday during opening . statements, prosecutor Kathleen Catania said the woman had been friendly . with Maxwell several years ago but told him to stay off her property . when he said he wanted to be romantically involved with her. Defence attorneys declined to make an . opening statement on Tuesday, though they questioned Montgomery about . whether authorities took photographs and collected evidence at Maxwell's . house before proper search warrants were obtained. Authorities had a search warrant only . for Maxwell's blue car when they first arrived at his house, but . Montgomery said law enforcement officers went inside after the woman ran . out to make sure nobody else was being harmed or was a threat. Evidence . was seized after another search warrant was obtained for the house the . next day, Montgomery testified. Maxwell will not use an insanity . defence and is competent to stand trial, his defense attorneys said at a . court hearing last month. State District Judge Trey Loftin also . previously denied a defence motion to suppress Maxwell's statements to . law enforcement authorities. Maxwell told police he strung the woman up on a homemade deer skinning rack he had in his garage. File photo . Defense . attorneys have said Maxwell had asked for a lawyer while being . questioned shortly after his arrest. But Loftin said Maxwell gave his . statements voluntarily and requested an attorney only when authorities . asked if anyone else had helped him. According to documents, Maxwell told . an investigator that after he took the woman back to his house, he . 'strung her up' in his garage on a homemade rack used for skinning deer. Maxwell has also been investigated on suspicion of involvement in the disappearance of his ex-wife Martha Martinez Maxwell. She has been missing since 1992. Maxwell divorced her in 1995, citing her disappearance. Martha Martinez Maxwell first went missing in 1987 before being found beaten with her throat cut near Ardmore, Oklahoma. She survived those injuries. Maxwell was charged with aggravated kidnapping in that case in 1987, but court records show a Tarrant County grand jury declined to indict him, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported.","Jeffrey Allan Maxwell, 59, on trial this week .

When a Michigan family was looking for answers to help their sick daughter in 2010, the last place they expected sound medical advice was from a man who would one day be running for president. But Brad and Jesi Smith found answers from then-Senator Rick Santorum to help their then 22-month-old daughter Faith. The smiling brunette girl suffers from the same genetic disorder – Trisomy 18 – as Mr Santorum’s youngest daughter Bella. Scroll down for video . Meeting: Jesi and Brad Smith pose with GOP hopeful Rick Santorum, centre, who is holding their daughter Faith. She suffers from the same genetic disorder as Santorum's daughter . Interested party: Santorum told Mr Smith several months later that without treatment for sleep apnea, their daughter Faith wouldn't survive . Helping hands: Brad and Jesi Smith said they owe their daughter's life to Rick Santorum, who told them to have her see a sleep specialist . The Rochester Hills, Michigan family told the Detroit Free Press about their incredible encounter with Mr Santorum two years ago, and the advice the family claims saved their daughter’s life. When Faith was born, doctors said the outlook was bleak. She was diagnosed with Trisomy 18, a genetic disorder that causes heart defects, kidney problems, delayed growth, and a small head. Mrs Smith, a radio station sales manager, told the paper that one doctor told her to put away funds for the funeral, as most children die either in infancy or as a toddler. ‘I said, absolutely not, I’m saving for her wedding,’ she told the Detroit Free Press. After switching hospitals to the University of Michigan’s C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital, prognosis looked better, as doctors were eager to learn from the case. In the spring of 2010, the Smiths were looking forward to meeting with Mr Santorum, as he was the only person they knew with a child who suffered from the same disease. Born this way: Faith was born with Trisomy 18, also called Edwards syndrome, which is a genetic disorder where a person is born with extra chromosome 18 material from a third copy which interferes with normal development . Have some faith: Faith's condition greatly improved after she was diagnosed with sleep apnea, which allowed doctors to better treat her . They spoke with him about their daughter Faith, and he showed them an article he had written on his BlackBerry about his own daughter Bella. His wife Karen talked to them throughout his speech that evening, the Detroit Free Press said. But seven months later, Faith’s health was declining. By chance, Mr Santorum was in town for an unrelated fundraiser and came into Mr Smith’s radio station to tape a show. Mr Smith approached Mr Santorum, asking his advice for his sick daughter. According to Mr Smith, the senator said they needed to get Faith tested for sleep apnea – where someone stops breathing in their sleep – and get her a breathing machine. He said that sleep apnea was particularly precarious for Trisomy 18 children. Mr Smith expressed his doubts, and said Mr Santorum then got stern, saying: ‘Look, you need to do this. If you don’t , you’re going to lose your daughter.’ Loving father: Rick Santorum held his daughter Bella on June 6, 2011 to announce he was running in the 2012 presidential race . Father and daughter: Trisomy 18 is a genetic disorder in which a person has a third copy of material from chromosome 18, instead of the usual two copies . Per the politician’s advice, the Smiths took Faith to see a sleep specialist, who diagnosed her with sleep apnea and said she was swinging her arms at night to keep herself awake so she wouldn’t stop breathing. Trisomy 18, also called Edwards syndrome, is a genetic disorder where a person is born with extra chromosome 18 material from a third copy which interferes with normal development. Described as a relatively common condition, it occurs in about one out of 3,000 live births, killing half of those within their first week. Those who have survived into their teenage years suffer from serious medical and developmental problems including clenched hands, mental deficiency, a small head or jaw and heart defects. A small number of adults with the condition make it to their twenties or thirties while always requiring assisted caregiving. Source: Trisomy18.org . The happy father credited Mr Santorum with the initial breakthrough. ‘I can honestly say that if not for Rick Santorum, (Faith) would not be alive today.’ Mr Santorum himself has gone through several scares with his own daughter Bella in recent months. In January, she was admitted to the hospital for pneumonia. When asked about her, Mr Santorum says his daughter was not expected to survive until her first birthday and often has to catch himself to stop from tears. 'I have a little girl who's three-and-a-half years old,' he told Christian conservatives in Iowa before winning the caucus there. 'I don't know whether her life is going to be measured - it's always been measured - in days and weeks. Yet here I am... because I feel like I wouldn't be a good dad if I wasn't out here fighting for a country that would see the dignity in her and every other child.' When voters ask him about her, he calls the decision to campaign 'gut-retching' but says he hopes to fight for all special needs families. 'You think she's fine, and then one cold and she's this close to dying,' he told the Washington Post in an interview last year. In October, he missed one of Bella's surgeries to participate in a debate and told the audience that he planned to take an all-night flight home from Las Vegas to be with her. 'I look at the simplicity and love she emits,' Mr Santorum said in a web video his campaign released after his scheduling drew questions, 'and it's clear to me we're the disabled ones.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:14 PM on 14th February 2012 . The level of brain injury, bleeding and damage to University of Virginia student Yeardley Love's brain was to such an extent that it could only have been caused by a powerful punch to the head, a jury heard today. Dr Christine E. Fuller, a . neuropathologist, testified in the trial of George Huguely V as the . prosecution continued to build the medical case that the defendant . killed his ex-girlfriend in one final, violent encounter on May 3, 2010. She said the blow was delivered with such a force that it 'twisted' the blood vessels in her brain, which is what caused the brain to hemorrhage and ultimately led to her death. The 22-year-old lay dying for two hours before her roommate returned home and found her lying face down in her underwear. Hearing: George Huguely V's weight loss was noted from the first day he appeared in court as prosecutors draw attention to the fact he was much bigger at the time of his ex-girlfriend's death . Prosecutor Dave Chapman drew attention to the difference in size and stature between Huguely and his ex-girlfriend during the trial to highlight the line he broke her door down and shook her violently . Dr Fuller described a lesion on the lower portion of Love's brain which said was a contusion, 'a fancy name for a bruise'. Asked what the bruise would signify, Fuller replied: 'It means there's been blunt force trauma to the head,' adding it was consistent with a head banging against a wall. Dr Fuller also described another injury . near the base of the brain in the vicinity of the spinal cord that would . have been caused by torque — a violent twisting. The damage to the brain would have shut . down Love's heart and lungs, Dr Fuller said, according to WJLA. She added there was no possibility that . Love's brain injuries could have happened during attempts to . resuscitate her - as the defense have suggested. Her testimony goes to the heart of . the prosecution's case - that Huguely violently attacked Love, banging . her head against the wall of her bedroom. Huguely, . 24, of Chevy Chase, Maryland, is accused of first-degree murder in the . death of Love, his on-again, off-again girlfriend and also a former UVA . lacrosse player. Support: Sharon Love, left, mother of murder victim, Yeardley Love, and daughter, Lexie Love, right, leave court arm in arm after opening statements in the trial of George Huguely V last week . Muscular: George Huguely is pictured running in front of another player during a game of lacrosse in 2010, his stocky build apparent . Both were seniors. Love, who was 22, was from suburban Baltimore. The defense, which has not presented any witnesses, has suggested Love's death was an accident, possibly related to her use of a prescription medicine for attention deficit disorder. Huguely has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and other charges. During highly technical testimony on Tuesday, Dr Fuller testified she found no pre-existing problems with Love's brain. The bruising was found on what she . described as the underside of the temporal lobe. She said it was the . result of the brain moving within the skull, and compared it to a . passenger in a car that comes to an abrupt halt. Asked . by Chapman what her conclusion would have been if she had not been . aware of Love's autopsy, Fuller said: 'Just looking at the brain, no . history, I would have called it trauma. No question.' The . testimony is important because of Huguely's claims, outlined in a . police interrogation interview hours after Love was found dead, that he . had grabbed Love and possibly shaken her but otherwise played down their . physical encounter. Threat: Prosecutors told the jury that Huguely . sent Yeardley Love (centre) an email before she died saying: 'I should . have killed you' He claimed she had banged her head against the wall of her apartment bedroom. On Monday, a medical examiner said . his autopsy found evidence of suffocation, though it did not cause . death, as well as a potentially deadly neck injury. Evidence: A love letter written to Yeardley from Huguely was shown to the court yesterday . Dr . Michael Gormley also described a series of bruises on Love's legs, . lower back, left forearm and hand and a small series of bruises on her . chest, which he said could be caused by grabbing. Love's . most severe injuries were on the right side of her face. The injuries . included a battered right eye, bruising to her neck and under her jaw. Police officers have testified that Huguely had bruises on his arms and legs and knuckles the morning Love's body was found. Huguely told a police detective who . interviewed him hours after Love's body was found that his bruised . knuckles were the result of a lacrosse injury. The prosecution contends Huguely went to Love's apartment after an alcohol-fueled day of golf. He kicked a gaping hole in the door of her bedroom door when she refused to let him in, prosecutors said. Witnesses who testified last week described their relationship as fiery and both had accused the other of infidelities. If convicted of first-degree murder, Huguely could be sentenced to life in prison. Talented: Yeardley was a star lacrosse . player at the University of Virginia and was just weeks away from . graduating when she was murdered . Yesterday a love letter written by the lacrosse player to Love was also used as evidence but was only shown to the judge, jurors and attorneys. It was recovered from a drawer in Love's bedroom after her death. The court heard yesterday that Huguely had scrapes and bruises all over his arms and legs when he was arrested. Officer Jeremy Carper testified in the first-degree murder trial and identified the bruises and scrapes on Huguely's arms and legs from photographs taken following his arrest. The lacrosse player's appearance was also highlighted yesterday, namely his considerable weight loss since he was arrested. On trial: Huguely has pleaded not guilty to all charges against him and said to did not cause enough injury to his girlfriend to kill her but admitted 'shaking her a little' Prosecutors were quick to point out Huguely's size in 2010 when he is accused of battering down his ex-girlfriend's door, putting in her in a choke hold and shaking her so violently she died. Ever since the former student turned up for his first courtroom appearance, the difference in his size and stature has been noted from the burly 200-pounds-plus lacrosse player who was arrested in May 2010. According to the Washington Post, during several days of testimony, prosecutor Dave Chapman repeatedly pointed out the difference in size between Huguely and Love at the time of her death - emphasizing Love's slim build in comparison to her ex-boyfriend's heavy, muscular build. Yesterday he asked Officer Carper what his height and weight was and asked him to compare it with Huguely when he arrested him. The stocky officer stood before the jury and said his height was six foot and weight about 200 pounds. He said the accused was 'maybe a little taller' and 'maybe a little heavier' than him.","Handwritten love letter sent to Love found in her drawer shown to jurors and judge .

Barack Obama today assured China's heir apparent leader that the U.S. welcomes Beijing's rise in the world - despite the country’s sharp policy differences over foreign affairs and economic issues. Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping was given a warm welcome by the U.S. President, who said strong cooperation is good for the rest of the world - but reiterated concerns over its human rights record. Vice President Xi, who is slated to replace Communist Party President Hu Jintao in autumn, defended China’s rights record over the past 30 years, but added that ‘there's always room for improvement’. Scroll down for video . Greetings: U.S. President Barack Obama, right, meets with Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping on Tuesday . His comments on Tuesday were similar to those made by President Jintao during a state visit one year ago. Both sides stressed the importance of stable relations between the two global powers. Underscoring the sensitivity of the rights issues among China's critics, a few hundred protesters marched outside the White House in Washington, waving Tibetan flags and calling for a free Tibet. They held signs proclaiming, ‘Xi Jinping: Tibet will be free’ and shouted slogans such as ‘Shame on Chinese government’ and ‘Stop lying to the world.’ But Vice President Xi's unusually long and high-level visit to the U.S. reflected the stature he is set to assume, and the importance the Obama administration puts on building ties with Beijing. Foreign affairs: Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping also met with U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, left, and U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, right, on Tuesday . ‘We welcome China's peaceful rise,’ President Obama said. ‘We believe that a strong and prosperous China is one that can help to bring stability and prosperity to the region and to the world.’ 'We welcome China's peaceful rise. We believe that a strong and prosperous China is one that can help to bring stability and prosperity to the region and to the world' U.S. President Barack Obama . He said he looks forward to future cooperation. A smiling Vice President Xi said he wants to build on the past relationship between President Obama and President Hu and ‘deepen the friendship’. ‘I hope to engage with a broad cross-section of American society during my current visit so as to deepen mutual understanding, expand consensus (and) strengthen cooperation,’ he added. Vice President Xi's visit is being closely watched because he will likely lead China over the coming decade. After becoming party leader, he is expected to replace President Hu in office next year. Good health: Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping, centre, proposes a toast with U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, right, and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton in Washington D.C. on Tuesday . In the years ahead, the U.S. and China are likely to see their economic ties grow even as they are viewed increasingly as military rivals - something acknowledged by Vice President Joe Biden. 'We are not always going to see eye-to-eye (or) see things exactly the same. But we have very important economic and political concerns that warrant that we work together' U.S. Vice President Joe Biden . ‘We are not always going to see eye-to-eye (or) see things exactly the same,’ he said. ‘But we have very important economic and political concerns that warrant that we work together.’ Vice President Xi has impeccable Communist Party credentials as the son of a famed revolutionary, but is viewed as more able to make personal connections than Hu and be more friendly. While his trip is unlikely to herald any policy changes, it may signal his leadership style. Other than his genial demeanour, he revealed little in his rather staged appearances at the White House. Talks: U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, third right, and Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping, fifth left, hold an expanded bilateral meeting with other U.S. and Chinese officials in the Roosevelt Room at the White House . But President Obama let on that Vice President Xi may take in an L.A. Lakers NBA basketball game when he visits Los Angeles, California, toward the end of his trip. 'I hope to engage with a broad cross-section of American society during my current visit so as to deepen mutual understanding, expand consensus (and) strengthen cooperation' Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping . Later on Tuesday, Vice President Xi was meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, who was hoping to inject some vigour into half-hearted ties between their two militaries. Washington will need to convince a sceptical Beijing that an adjustment in U.S. foreign policy to emphasise the economically booming Asia-Pacific region is not aimed at containing the rise of China. And for its part, China needs to convince the U.S. and many Asian nations that they need not fear its two-decade military build-up. Protests: Demonstrators wave flags and banners during a pro-Tibetan demonstration in Lafayette Park across from the White House in Washington D.C. on Tuesday . Vice President Biden and President Obama also discussed some thorny foreign policy issues with Vice President Xi, including North Korea, Iran and Syria. 'Shame on Chinese government' / 'Stop lying to the world' Slogans shouted by protesters . Last week China joined Russia in vetoing a U.N. Security Council resolution pressuring Syrian President Bashar Assad's government over its violent crackdown on opponents. Vice President Xi said that a greater part of his discussions were on economic and trade issues. He said the U.S. and China agree the international economic and financial situation remains ‘grim.’ He added that ensuring growth and promoting employment were high on the domestic agenda of both countries. Shouts: Dozens of impassioned pro-Tibet and anti-Chinese government activists outside the White House meditated, waved flags and chanted 'China lies, Tibetans die' and 'Xi, Tibet will be free!' The key American concerns are the vast trade imbalance between the world's two largest economies, and Chinese trade rule violations. 'On critical issues like human rights we . will continue to emphasise what we believe is the importance of . recognising the aspirations and rights of all people' U.S. President Barack Obama . The U.S. also reiterated problems with intellectual property theft and the value of China's currency. The yuan has gained a little against the dollar in the past 1 1/2 years but still is viewed by Washington as undervalued to boost the exports that still drive China's economy. With President Obama vying for re-election this November, Republican presidential front-runner Mitt Romney is accusing him of being soft on China at the expense of a still-fragile U.S. economy. Taking part: Losel Tenzon, left, attends a pro-Tibetan demonstration and Falun Gong practitioners meditate . Alongside Vice President Xi, President Obama stressed the ‘importance of working by the same rules of the road when it comes to the world economic system.’ 'On critical issues like human rights we will continue to emphasise what we believe is the importance of recognising the aspirations and rights of all people,' President Obama added. Vice President Xi said the U.S. and China should ‘strive for greater balance in trade and investment between the two countries’. U.S. officials see the visit primarily as an investment in relationship-building, both on the personal level and to advance a three-year push for cooperative ties with Asia's emerging superpower.

A British schoolgirl has died two days before her seventh birthday after falling from a stairwell during a family holiday in Tenerife. Heather Kennedy lost her fight for life yesterday morning - four days after being rushed to hospital with head injuries following the accident at her family's rented apartment on the Spanish island. She had been in intensive care with multiple fractures to her skull since losing her footing as she ran to meet her cousins. Scene of tragedy: British schoolgirl Heather Kennedy is believed to have fallen from a concrete ledge (centre) next to the stairwell at her family's rented apartment in Tenerife while running out to greet her cousins . The accident happened at around 7pm last Friday at an apartment block in the popular resort of Playa de las Americas. She was due to celebrate her seventh birthday tomorrow before flying back to Britain. Her mother, Agnes, 50, from Chapelhall, Airdrie, raised the alarm after the youngster's uncle Joshua found her lying unconscious on the ground beside the apartment moments after her fall. It is not clear exactly how the youngster fell. Initial reports suggested she lost her footing while going down the stairs, but it is now believed she plunged from a wall next to the staircase . between the first and ground floors. Police questioned the family after being called to hospital by doctors as a matter of routine but concluded Heather had died in a tragic accident. Holiday horror: The hospital Ntra Sra de Candelaria where Heather died after an accident in her apartment block in Playa de las Americas, in Tenerife . A source close to the case said: 'Her family told the police she ran out of the flat to meet her cousins who were outside and her uncle saw her lying on the ground by the entrance to the apartment block after running out behind her. 'It looks as if she's fallen from a low wall by spiral stairs leading from one floor to another. 'Doctors called police as a matter of routine after they'd examined the child. 'The injuries she suffered are consistent with a fall from height.' A spokesman for the National Police in Tenerife confirmed: 'This is being treated as a tragic accident.' Heather was transferred to a hospital in the island capital Santa Cruz after doctors at a hospital near Playa de Las Americas discovered she had cracked her skull in four places. She was kept in intensive care at Our Lady of Candelaria University Hospital over the weekend but lost her fight for life yesterday. The family are thought to have stayed on the island to make arrangements to repatriate Heather's body. A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We have been notified of the death of a British national in Santa Cruz, Tenerife and we stand ready to provide consular assistance to the family.'","Heather Kennedy lost her footing on wall next to flight of stairs .

"By . Charles Walford . Last updated at 2:59 PM on 14th February 2012 . Killer: Thomas Haigh was described by the judge as 'an arrogant young man' A former cage-fighter who gunned down two gangland enforcers linked to an IRA drugs gang has been jailed for life. Drugs mule Thomas Haigh, 26, killed David Griffiths and Brett Flournoy on a remote Cornish farm because they were demanding he go to Brazil for a second time and bring back cocaine. He has been told he must serve a minimum of 35 years for the shootings. Accomplice Ross Stone, 28, was cleared of the men's murders, but will serve five years after admitting helping dispose of the men. He burned the bodies before burying them in their van following the shooting at his home, Sunny Corner Farm, in Trenance Downs near St Austell. The bodies of Flournoy, a 31-year-old boxer and pub landlord with two children, from Bebington on the Wirral in Merseyside, and father-of-three Griffiths, 35, from Bracknell, Berkshire, were unearthed after Stone confessed to having disposed of their corpses. Both Stone and Haigh owed the dead men around £40,000 in drug debts. Passing sentence at Truro Crown Court, Mr Justice Mackay told Haigh he was an 'arrogant young man' who had got out of his depth in the criminal underworld. 'These were bad men but they were bad men with the right not to be killed because trading in drugs does not carry the death penalty,' he said. 'You were attracted to the gangster way of life, you convinced yourself you were a big boy playing in the big league. But I found your erratic behaviour made you unsuited to this elusive trade. 'This was no more than a result of your chosen lifestyle. You knew the rules of the criminal club you joined and you broke them.' Griffiths' mother, Janet Griffiths, . from Plymouth, Devon, said yesterday: 'Our family has been devastated by . the loss of our beloved David and the horrific way in which he was . murdered. 'As a family we never imagined we would be standing here today and David would be gone, it really has been a living hell. Victims: David Griffiths (left) and Brett Flournoy (right), who had links to an IRA drugs gang, were shot by Thomas Haigh and buried on a remote Cornish farm . 'We have had to accept the horrific way in which David was taken from us but also had to endure six weeks of worrying and looking for David. To find out that he was then murdered, burned and buried was truly too much to comprehend. 'We have had to endure months of unpleasant stories and statements being made about David, most of which have been completely untrue. This has put immense stress on all of our family but we do know that those who were close to David know the truth and the real Dave. 'We shall forever cherish the happy memories we have of him, he is missed every single day and will forever be loved.' Jane Flournoy, Brett's sister-in-law, made a statement on behalf of the family of the former British Army soldier, who served with the Royal Engineers for six years. His fiancee Kelly, a staff nurse, gave birth to his third son after he died. 'Much of what has been said about Brett throughout the course of this trial has been unsubstantiated and alleged by two people who have now been convicted of horrific crimes,' she said. 'We have been left totally devastated by Brett's death. He was a loving son, fiance, father and brother. His death has left a huge gap in the lives of all our family. 'The worst thing is that as a result of the actions of Ross Stone and Thomas Haigh we never had a chance to say goodbye and we still expect him to walk though the door.' Haigh and Stone's four-week trial heard that the victims were gangland enforcers working for an IRA gang which 'ran' Liverpool's illegal drugs trade. The jury took less than three hours to find Haigh, formerly of Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, guilty of two counts of murder. Tomb: The van in which which Brett Flournoy and David Griffiths were buried . Shallow grave: The site on a remote Cornish farm where the remains of the two murdered men were found after Ross Stone confessed to disposing of the bodies . The court had heard that both men owed Griffiths and Flournoy as much as £40,000. Building contractor Stone had run up debts of between £30,000 and £40,000 with Griffiths and Flournoy after intervening to help a friend who was in debt, and was under immense pressure to repay the money. He said he faced constant death threats 'from the first day' against him and his family and even borrowed money from his mother and allowed the pair to turn his home into a cocaine processing plant, supplying users in Cornwall. In April last year, he told the court, Griffiths and Flournoy arrived unannounced at the home of his partner Laura's parents, hours after she had given birth to their second child, a daughter, because he turned his phone off while they were in the labour ward. The two men then sent Haigh down to 'babysit' him and a crop of cannabis he was growing in a bid to give them their money. But Haigh was also being pressured . into doing a drugs run to Brazil and feared going abroad because a . friend was in a South American prison after being caught on a recent . trip. Stone told the trial that Haigh talked about killing the two men in the days before they died. Two weeks after they died, on July 1, . police made an unrelated drugs raid on Sunny Corner and arrested Stone . for growing cannabis in two shipping containers he had equipped with . hydroponics equipment and buried underground to evade detection by . infra-red heat-sensing cameras. Burial site: Flournoy and Griffiths were buried on this farm, owned by Stone, in Trenance Downs near St Austell . Several days later, Stone admitted in a police interview that the two men were buried on the property and told police where to dig. Stone told the jury he had driven with his mother to Newquay to report the crime to police but had been too scared of the dead men's associates and decided to make them disappear instead. Giving evidence, he said he had returned to the farm to find the drug dealers' lifeless bodies on the ground. Haigh, he said, had appeared topless and dishevelled. Haigh claimed the men arrived at the farm and he had been beaten up by Griffiths. But he said he fled when Flournoy produced a gun and did not know how the men had been killed. The court was told that when interviewed by police he said the men worked for the IRA. He also boasted that he 'knew how to get rid of bodies properly' and would not 'leave it to a thick farmer (Stone) to tidy up'. Stone had previously pleaded guilty to two charges of obstructing a coroner. Haigh, . who served nine months in a young offenders' institution in 2005 and . 2006 for dealing in heroin and crack cocaine, was on the run at the time . of the shooting on June 16 last year. While . living in Workington, he had skipped a court appearance in Carlisle, . Cumbria the previous March for possession of an air gun because he was . in Brazil smuggling cocaine back to the UK. He . showed no emotion as the judge said the pressure he was under from . Griffiths and his 'role model' Flournoy was 'no mitigation' for the . crimes he had committed. 'You shot these men dead, acting alone and not in concert with Stone,' Mr Justice Mackay said. 'You . left him to cover up the carnage you left behind you. Why you did this . is, to my mind, perfectly clear. How you went about it is less clear. 'But you aimed and fired the shots that killed these two men.' The trial heard that after Haigh killed the two men he fled to Yorkshire before eventually handing himself in to police.","Thomas Haigh buried the bodies and van on remote Cornish farm .

A motorcyclist found her body along a . dirt track on January 7, although authorities believe it was just there . for a day before it was discovered. The . cars of Adams and his mother, Tina Clark, were later seized by police, . who said they were looking for evidence in the vehicles.

A Texas family law judge seen beating his older daughter in a video she posted on YouTube has been placed under a temporary restraining order, which his ex-wife's attorney says effectively prevents him from visiting his younger daughter. Under the order issued Thursday by another judge, Aransas County Court-at-Law Judge William Adams is forbidden from visiting his 10-year-old daughter without getting permission from the girl's mother, his ex-wife. The order also says Adams can't disparage the woman or drink alcohol within 24 hours of seeing his child. Scroll down for videos . History of violence: Hillary Adams said she was regularly beaten by her father . Catching him in the act: Hillary Adams (left) appeared with her mother Hallie to describe the abuse they suffered at . the hands of Judge William Adams at their home in Rockport, Texas . Brett Pritchard, the attorney for . Adams' ex-wife Hallie Adams, said in a prepared statement that the . ruling 'temporarily terminates the visitation between Judge Adams and . his younger child'. William Adams' attorney did not respond to a request for comment Friday from The Associated Press. State District Judge Kemper Stephen . Williams scheduled a hearing for Nov. 21 to decide on Hallie Adams' request to have William Adams' visitation denied or require that it be . supervised. William Adams has not held court since his 23-year-old . daughter Hillary Adams released a secretly-recorded 2004 video of him . beating her with a belt. Disciplinarian: Judge Adams faced public calls for his resignation after the video went viral . William Adams faced public calls for his resignation and threats after Hillary Adams posted the 8-minute clip on YouTube that shows her father viciously lashing her with a belt and trying to force her to bend over her bed to be beaten despite her pleas to stop. Hallie Adams filed an affidavit Thursday claiming a dysfunctional 22-year marriage and conflict that continued since their 2007 divorce. Pritchard said the furious reaction to the video triggered the legal move. 'The impetus is she (Hallie Adams) doesn't feel at first that her daughter is safe going down there to be with the judge right now,' Pritchard said. 'The impetus now is the result of the video, not necessarily the video itself.' The district attorney and federal prosecutors both declined to bring charges against William Adams, but the State Commission on Judicial Conduct continues its investigation. Last week, Rockport Police Chief Tim Jayroe said that police did not interview the younger daughter, but asked both Hallie and Hillary Adams about it and there was no indication of abuse of the younger daughter. It comes after police revealed the judge would not face criminal charges because too much time has passed. Adams likely would have faced . charges of causing injury to a child or other assault-related offences . for the savage 2004 beating. But the five-year statutes of limitations expired so the Aransas County Court-at-Law Judge probably won't be charged for beating the cerebral palsy sufferer, Rockport Police Chief Tim Jayroe said.

Hallie Adams appeared with her . daughter Hillary to describe years of abuse in their 'dysfunctional' family and . Hillary revealed her father dared her to post the video online.

Brave: Hillary Adams, who suffers from axatic cerebral palsy, exposed her father's violence . 'We're very close now,' Hillary said. Speaking to the Today show, she said: 'I told him I had the video... and he dared me to post it.' Judge Adams, who presides mainly over cases involving children, remained unrepentant. He released a three-page statement earlier this month, saying his daughter posted the clip to get back at him for telling her he would be reducing the amount of financial support he gives her and taking away her Mercedes. The statement did not include an apology for the beating, but he told Corpus Christi television station KZTV that the video 'looks worse than it is,' that he had already apologized to his daughter and that he was just disciplining his child for stealing. Miss . Adams, who has suffered from ataxic cerebral palsy from birth, said her . condition causes problems including difficulty with balance, shaky . movements of hands or feet, and difficulty with speech. Hillary Adams was asked by the Today Show how she felt about the ordeal she had suffered now. Miss . Adams said: 'I've experienced everything from crying about it to . laughing.' She added: 'It did happen regularly . for a period of time, and I could tell because of the pattern that . things were escalating again, so I set up my video camera on the dresser . and covered the little red light with a scarf. 'About half an hour after I set the camera up this happened and it was amazing that I was able to capture such a thing.' Miss . Adams explained that she waited seven years to release the video . because she feared for her safety and that of her mother and younger . sister. Model child: Hillary Adams had previously posted a video showing herself as an extremely gifted pianist . Hallie Adams said: 'I was completely brainwashed and controlled. I did every single thing that he did. When I leave the room he is telling me what to say, what to do.' The video, entitled 'Family law judge beats own daughter for using the internet, please spread', shows the motive for the attack was because Miss Adams, who suffers from cerebral palsy, had been caught downloading music to the computer in her bedroom. In the footage, Judge Adams can be seen delivering around . ten powerful strikes across his daughter's legs and backside. His wife then grabs . the belt from him to take over, at which point he walks out only to . return moments later with another belt so he can continue beating her.

Sergio Gonzales got the shock of his life when a palm tree branch fell from above went through his car windscreen and hit him in the face. And it turned out the branch was not even from a real tree. A metal replica snapped off a T-Mobile phone mast during high winds in El Paso, Texas. The branch landed just inches from Mr Gonzales’s neck but he survived the scare with cuts to his face that were treated in hospital. Sliced: A metal replica palm tree branch snapped off a T-Mobile phone mast during high winds in El Paso, Texas, cracking a driver's windscreen . Dangerous: City inspectors are probing the incident in El Paso and a local politician said she will work to avoid something like this happening again . ‘I truly thought somebody had hit me,’ Mr Gonzales told ABC affiliate KVIA. ‘I took out a rag to clean up and realised I had glass all over me.’ Mobile phone towers are often disguised as trees in U.S. cities after consultation with residents who want them to be less of an eyesore. The tower in question was modified by T-Mobile in 2007 to look like a palm tree and was given a safety check in March 2011, reported KVIA. New branches were added on in 2010 - but the one that snapped off broke in the middle, rather than at the attachment point to the pole.

Detained: Albrecht Muth, who is charged with killing his much-older socialite wife, has been sent to a mental hospital for an assessment after a doctor said he was delusional . A German-born man charged with killing his much-older socialite wife has been sent to a mental hospital for an assessment after a doctor said he was delusional. A District of Columbia Superior Court Judge also ruled that Albrecht Muth, 47, was temporarily incompetent for trial, pending a complete evaluation at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington. Muth is charged with strangling and beating to death his 91-year-old wife, Viola Drath, a German journalist and socialite. Detectives said Muth had visible scratches on his forehead after his wife's body was found in the bathroom of their home in the city's fashionable Georgetown neighborhood in August. They also said Muth presented her relatives with a forged document that claimed he was entitled to a portion of her estate after her death. Muth has denied wrongdoing, and has suggested he was arrested because he was the only convenient suspect. The case has taken a series of odd turns since his arrest. Muth, who claims to be a brigadier general with the Iraqi army, has asked for the right to wear his military uniform at trial — though the Iraqi Embassy says he has no connection to the government or the military. In November he tried to fire his court-appointed attorneys, but a judge says he's no longer physically or mentally capable of representing himself. Killed: Viola Drath was found unconscious in the bathroom of her home in Georgetown, Washington D.C. in August . Muth, who had been intentionally starving himself while in jail, was also recently hospitalised and has missed his last several court appearances. His condition has improved as he has temporarily resumed eating, but he has declared his plans to go on a 40-day fast, said Maria Amato, a lawyer for the D.C. Department of Corrections. 'He thinks that he is chosen like Moses and Jesus, that he will be protected in his 40-day fast,' Ms Amato said. Nader Marzban, a doctor who has been meeting with Muth, called the defendant delusional. Tragic: The home of Albrecht Muth and Viola Drath in Washington's fashionable Georgetown neighborhood . He said Muth claimed to see the Archangel Gabriel and that Gabriel tells him what to do. He said Muth at one point questioned whether the doctor was even an actual person, saying he wanted to shake him 'because I'm not sure if you're real or an illusion.' Mr Marzban said Muth at first claimed not to know why he was in jail, but then revealed, 'They say I killed my wife.' Muth told Mr Marzban that he was not concerned about his case. 'He said, ""God will take care of that. I don't need to worry about that.""' Prosecutors have said they expect Muth to be indicted by a grand jury next month.","Judge also rules that Albrecht Muth is incompetent for trial .

Kristy Gaffney could not believe her luck when she met a man who was well-connected, wealthy and intelligent on an online dating site. Just months later, the 29-year-old from Plymouth Meeting, Philadelphia and the man - who told her he was called Ed, part of the DuPont family, divorced and worked for the C.I.A - began discussing marriage. But the chance meeting has left her life in tatters, after he tricked her into signing paperwork to give her baby to him... and his wife. Scroll down for video . Duped: Kristy Gaffney, 29, met a man online with whom she had a child. He tricked her into signing papers that allowed him to adopt their child . 'I thought he was Mr. Perfect,'Gaffney told NBC10. 'There’s no words for it. I’m just so angry at him.' Gaffney told the news channel she was at first reluctant to take the relationship seriously, but eventually agreed to meet him in a public place. But the dinner at a restaurant led to many more dates, in which Gaffney discovered Ed's 'connections'. She told NBC10: 'He said, ""My last name is Dupont"". And I said, ""related to the Duponts?"" And he said, ""Yes"".' 'Liars': Emmitt Dippold, right, told Gaffney his name was Ed Dupont and that he was divorced. In fact, he was still married and he and his wife wanted her child . The couple began talking about marriage and having children. Ed told Gaffney his former wife had been unable to get pregnant. Gaffney became pregnant soon after. She said that Ed at first demanded she have an abortion before changing his mind. With his name not on the birth certificate after the baby was born, he asked Gaffney to sign some paperwork allowing him to claim his right as the baby's father. She has since admitted she did not understand the papers, but signed them anyway. The couple, who were living apart but planned to move in together, shared caring for the baby. Regrets: Gaffney took the couple to court and overturned the adoption . Evidence: Without understanding the adoption paperwork, Gaffney signed it . But one day, Gaffney did not return the baby to its mother. 'That’s when he told me that the paperwork I actually signed was me giving up the rights, not to him to have his rights,' she told NBC10. 'It was me giving up my rights so his wife could adopt my baby, and I said, ""Are you kidding me?""' He told Gaffney he was actually called Emmitt Dippold, still married and in the process of adopting the baby - with his wife. 'I couldn’t even believe that someone was capable of something like that,' Gaffney said. She took Dippold and his wife to court and the adoption was overturned based on fraud. The unknown: The case raises concerns about meeting strangers online . But in court documents, he denied he . had claimed he was a Dupont.

Dutch vet Anne-Marie Verbruggen was called in after the tourist attraction's star turn had difficulty keeping her eye open and it started to stream. Operation: Win Thida, 44, was injured in a scuffle with a fellow elephant at Amsterdam's Artis Zoo when she was poked in the eye by a twig . Procedure: Win Thida was anaesthetised while standing up and vet Anne-Marie Verbruggen then stood on a ladder to place the contact lens in her eye . An examination revealed the cornea had been damaged, sparking fears that without something to protect the eye it would never heal and she could soon end up blind. Win Thida was anaesthetised while standing up, as elephants cannot lie down for long periods before their immense weight hampers their breathing. Anne-Marie, who had only ever put contact lenses into horses, then climbed up a ladder to reach the eye. The whole procedure took one hour and Win Thida, who is the dominant matriarch of the Amsterdam herd, was reportedly 'much happier' straight away. Saving sight: Dutch vet Anne-Marie Verbruggen was called in after the tourist attraction's star turn had difficulty keeping her eye open and it started to stream . Her eye was opening and closing easier and now, it is hoped, the protective lens will let the wound heal. Zoo bosses expect to remove the lens in 'a couple of months'.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:33 PM on 14th February 2012 . Britain and the U.S. have joined forces to demand the United Nations take further action in Syria, as President Bashar Assad's brutal military crackdown shows no sign of stopping. Prime Minister David Cameron and U.S. President Barack Obama agreed in a telephone call last night on the 'need for international unity' - as the city of Homs was bombarded by rockets and mortars for a eleventh consecutive day. Today's attacks saw Assad's troops attacking rebels and homes on several fronts, with Homs succumbing to severe food and fuel shortages as residents remain trapped inside their homes. The need, Cameron's spokesman said, included: 'Further action at the UN and a broad and strong coalition in the new Friends of Syria group.' Warzone: Syrian army tanks are now a regular sight on the streets of Homs, as Assad continues to fight the 11-month uprising . Joining forces: British PM David Cameron (left) and U.S. President Barack Obama (right) want the UN to take further action in Syria . The two leaders, who are reluctant to get dragged in militarily, also 'discussed the possibility of increasing the pressure on the Assad regime through additional sanctions'. The conversation came after the Arab League floated ideas to send in a joint U.N.-Arab peacekeeping force. That plan has been backed in part by the Obama administration, which feared it would be difficult to gain authorisation by the UN Security Council. Chief among the hurdles is opposition by Russia and China, which vetoed a far less ambitious Security Council action already this month. Russia has said peacekeepers could not be sent without Syrian government approval, and  officials in Damascus have already rejected the proposal, calling it unjustified interference in internal affairs. 'We support the Arab League's decisions ... to try to end the violence and move toward a transition,' Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said. Destruction: A house in Homs has been left as rubble after being shelled by Syrian forces . Raining down: Bombs continue to fall on the city of Homs as the crackdown continues into a second week . 'There are a lot of challenges to be discussed as to how to put into effect all of their recommendations. And certainly, the peacekeeping request is one that will take agreement and consensus. 'So, we don't know that it is going to be possible to persuade Syria. They have already as of today rejected that, but I think this is what we are trying to explore,' she told reporters after meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu at the State Department. At the White House, press secretary Jay Carney said the administration has begun discussions with the UN, the Arab League and allies about how an eventual peacekeeping force could work. He said nothing about any U.S. participation, but it would be unlikely in the near term. Wounded: A young girl, injured in shelling earlier this month, sits in her Homs home as the brutal crackdown on opposition against Assad continues . Destruction: Homs, which is the centre of the uprising against Assad, is still being bombarded by rockets and mortars . For now, talk of a peacekeeping force is preliminary, and largely theoretical. Carney said the discussion is about how peacekeepers 'could help to maintain peace in Syria, starting with there being a peace to keep'. A February 24 meeting is scheduled in Tunisia of the Friends of Syria group that will plot efforts to compel Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime to end its brutal crackdown on opponents. Training: Syrian rebels rehearse their moves which they continue to use against Assad's forces . Making a noise: Despite unleashing thousands of mortars and rockets onto Homs, Assad has still not put down the rebel uprising against his rule . Ahead of that meeting, Clinton said the U.S., Turkey and other supporters of the Arab League plan would be discussing ways to support the opposition and expand the delivery of humanitarian supplies to those in need. Among the topics of discussion will be intensifying sanctions and diplomatic pressure on Assad and his inner circle, greater outreach to regime opponents in and outside of the country and boosting financial contributions to organizations like the International Committee for the Red Cross and Red Crescent that are working in Syria. Scars: Doctors said they are treating dozens of young Syrians injured during the violence at a hospital run by Paris-based Medecins Sans Frontieres in Amman .

An explosion hit a major oil pipeline in a rebel-held district of Homs this morning as the Syrian government's bombardment of the city entered its 13th day. Elite forces backed by armoured personnel carriers also stormed part of Damascus today, firing machine guns in the air, in the closest deployment of troops to the centre of the capital in the 11-month uprising. Meanwhile, troops launched a new offensive on the city of Hama, firing on residential neighbourhoods from armoured vehicles and mobile anti-aircraft guns. Dark day: Black smoke is seen rising over Homs today after an explosion hit a major oil pipeline feeding a refinery in the Syrian city. The government blamed the blast on 'terrorist saboteurs', while rebels said it was caused by the mis-firing military . Show of strength: A tank is seen in a neighbourhood of Zabadani, near Damascus on Tuesday. Special forces stormed the city today in the closest deployment of troops to the centre of the capital since the start of the 11-month uprising . The escalation of the conflict comes as France's foreign minister announced it had started negotiating a new UN Security Council resolution on Syria with Russia and wanted to discuss creating 'humanitarian corridors' in the country. China, which along with Russia vetoed a resolution earlier this month, was quick to warn that mistakes by the UN Security Council could worsen the bloodshed. The leader of a global Islamic group also stressed that the international community must rule out military intervention as a solution to the crisis. In Washington, a State Department official said the U.S. and its allies were closely monitoring Syria's stockpiles of chemical arms and portable anti-aircraft missiles amid concerns they could fall into the hands of militant groups. Out in force: Demonstrators protest against Syria's President Bashar al-Assad in the al-Midan district of Damascus on Tuesday. Government troops have responded by making arrests in the Barzeh neighbourhood of the capital . Call for action: An anti-government protester makes their views known during a demonstration in Damascus . The attack on the oil pipeline, near a large Sunni Muslim district, sent thick, black smoke billowing into the sky for several hours after the blast. The Local Co-ordination Committees and the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the Homs pipeline was in the rebel-held neighbourhood of Baba Amro, which has been shelled by (LCC) regime troops for the past 12 days. It was not clear what caused the explosion. The authorities have accused 'terrorist saboteurs' of hitting the pipeline while opposition activists said the military, which began firing shells, mortar rounds and rockets into Baba Amro on February 3, has been hitting it by mistake. Up for the fight: Syrian soldiers who defected to join the Free Syrian Army are seen in Al Baiadah, near Homs, on Tuesday . Call to arms: Syrian rebels aim during a weapons training exercise outside Idlib, Syria, as government forces renewed their assault on the rebellious city of Homs . The pipeline runs from the Rumeilan fields in the eastern Syriac Desert to the Homs refinery, one of two in the country, has been hit several times before during the 11-month uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. Footage from an activist's camera feeding live footage from Homs via the internet showed a dense plume of smoke rising behind houses in the district. At around the same time, government forces launched a new operation today in another flashpoint city, Hama, after telephone, mobile phone and internet connections were cut, according to The Observatory and the LCC. 'Loud explosions were heard in the neighbourhoods' of Hama, the Observatory said in a statement. Meanwhile, Elite Syrian forces erected roadblocks in the central Barzeh neighbourhood of Damascus as they moved deeper into the capital, residents and activists said. Backing the regime: This picture released by the official Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) shows supporters of President Bashar al-Assad in the northern Syrian port of Latakia . Troops from the Fourth Armoured Division and Republican Guards erected roadblocks, searched houses and made arrests. Residents said the troops were looking for opposition activists and members of the Free Syrian Army, which has been providing security for protests against President Bashar al-Assad in the district. France's foreign minister said today it wanted to discuss creating 'humanitarian corridors' in the country as it opened talks on a new U.N. Security Council resolution on Syria with Russia. 'We are renegotiating a resolution at the U.N. Security Council to persuade the Russians,' Alain Juppe told France Info radio. He said the U.N. General Assembly would vote on a 'symbolic' resolution on Thursday that would add to pressure on the Damascus government. Bloodshed: More than 5,000 people have died in the 11-month uprising against Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad (above) Paris said on Tuesday it had created an emergency fund for aid agencies looking to help the Syrian people and would propose a similar one at an international level next week when countries meet in Tunisia to discuss the escalating crisis.    'The idea of humanitarian corridors that I previously proposed to allow NGOs to reach the zones where there are scandalous massacres should be dicussed at the Security Council,' he said. Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, secretary general of the 57-nation Organization of Islamic Co-operation, said he remained involved in 'quiet diplomacy activities' with Syrian President Bashar Assad over the power struggle that has cost more than 5,000 lives. The violence has led to the Middle Eastern country's most severe international isolation in more than four decades of Assad family rule. 'What we really need to do is exclude military intervention from our side,' Ihsanoglu told the National Press Club of Australia during a visit to Canberra as a guest of the Australian government. Ihsanoglu, who was born in Egypt and lives in Turkey, said the lesson from conflicts in Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia was that outside military intervention 'did not bring any good to the people of those countries and to the region... and to the world at large.' Arab and Western countries had pushed for a U.N. resolution supporting calls for Assad to hand over some powers to defuse the crisis, but Russia and China vetoed the measure this month. Ihsanoglu did not address a proposal put forth Sunday by the 22-member Arab League, calling for the U.N. Security Council to create a joint peacekeeping force for Syria and urging Arab states to sever all diplomatic contact with Assad's regime. Syria immediately rejected the proposal, which was adopted by League foreign ministers meeting in Cairo. A proposed U.N. General Assembly resolution, circulated Tuesday by Egypt, would strongly condemn human rights violations by the Syrian regime. It backs Arab League efforts to end the conflict but makes no specific reference to a peacekeeping force. Diplomats say the resolution is likely to be put to a vote Thursday in the 193-member world body, where there are no vetoes. While General Assembly resolutions are nonbinding, they do reflect world opinion on major issues. The OIC was established in Morocco in 1969 at an Islamic summit of 25 Muslim countries 'to safeguard and protect the interests of the Muslim world in the spirit of promoting international peace and harmony among various people of the world.' The U.S. and its allies are closely monitoring Syria's stockpiles of chemical arms and portable anti-aircraft missiles, a State Department official says, amid concerns that the country's unconventional weapons could fall into the hands of terrorist or militant groups while the 11-month-old uprising continues. 'Syria is a country of significant proliferation concern, so we monitor its chemical weapons activities very closely,' the State Department official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence-related matters. 'We believe Syria's chemical weapons stockpile remains under Syrian government control, and we will continue to work closely with like-minded countries to impede proliferation (of) Syria's chemical weapons program.' The official added that the U.S. is in discussion with its allies on ways to ensure that Syria's stockpile of portable anti-aircraft missiles, called Man-Portable Air Defense Systems, or MANPADS, aren't stolen or diverted. 'We are consulting with allies and partners as we plan for a variety of contingencies,' the official said. Meanwhile, a senior Chinese diplomat said missteps by the United Nations Security Council could cause worse bloodshed in Syria. Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Cui Tiankai said the Security Council must be 'very careful' when dealing with Syria. Cui reiterated China's position that it supported the role of the Arab League in seeking to defuse the Syrian conflict and 'inclusive dialogue' in Syria to end the violence.","Government blames attack on major pipeline on 'terrorist saboteurs'

A business tycoon who spent $20 million on luxury gifts - including $1.6million on soap - has been taken to hospital after concerns over the state of his mental health. Ed Bazinet, 68, raced around the booths at the International Gift Fair in the Javits Center, New York, buying up everything he could lay his hands on. Last month, sources said he spent $39.4 million at a similar event in Paris. The huge sums of money that Mr .

However one vendor told gawker.com that Mr Bazinet's assistants 'were cancelling all the orders'. Mr Bazinet, who is originally from . Minnesota, started his career making flower arrangements and is now reportedly worth $100million.

"By . Luke Salkeld and Nichola Jones . Last updated at 4:27 PM on 15th February 2012 . 'A wonderful vicar': John Suddards, who was found dead in his home . A 43-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of the murder of the Reverend John Suddards. The vicar was found with multiple stab wounds at a vicarage in Thornbury, Gloucestershire on Monday. The body of the 59-year-old was discovered by builders who were carrying out work at his vicarage the day after he had held his regular Sunday service. The Cambridge-educated vicar, who lived alone, was a former lawyer who had taken on his parish less than a year ago. Friends said he had settled well into the community. Police and paramedics were called to the old stone vicarage at 10.20am on Monday and Mr Suddards was declared dead at the scene. Avon and Somerset Police launched an investigation into the death – which they described as ‘suspicious’ – and a cordon was set up as officers searched for clues. Detective Chief Inspector Simon Crisp, who is leading the investigation, said: 'I am in a position to confirm now that body found yesterday in the vicarage was Reverend John Suddards. 'He suffered multiple stab wounds, and therefore this is now a murder investigation. 'A 43-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.' Officers confirmed that the builders, on a planned job, had obtained a key from a caretaker before they walked into the vicarage and made the grim discovery. Mr Suddards, a clergyman for 22 years, is understood to have never married, and had only started working in the town in July last year after transferring from a parish in Witham, Essex. He took over the running of St Mary’s Church in Thornbury, as well as St Arilda in Oldbury and Shepperdine Chapel, also in south Gloucestershire. Shirley Holloway, 69, of South Gloucestershire Council, said Mr Suddards was a ‘wonderful’ vicar. ‘It just doesn’t seem possible. He led our service on Sunday, I shook hands with him in the church,’ she said. ‘He was a very personable man. You would absolutely not expect this sort of thing to happen here. Tragedy: St Mary's Church in Thornbury, Gloucestershire, where Rev Suddards has taken over as vicar last July . Police attend the scene outside the vicarage next to St Mary's church, where the vicar's body was found by builders . ‘He is such a well-known figure and to hear that it might be a suspicious death is just so hard to comprehend. He has made the most tremendous impression on the town. ‘He has fitted in exceptionally well in the parish and taken part in so much during his short time here. People here are so horrified.’ At the time of his appointment last year, Mr Suddards revealed that a serious car crash led to his dramatic career change. He said: ‘I was a barrister in London . and I had a major road accident when I was 31. As a result of that . accident, and a series of events that happened, it led me to believe . that I should go into the church. ‘Lawyers . can do two things, they can separate people and they can transfer . money, but not much more than that, and I felt I would like to do much . more than that.’ Councillor Neil Halsall, 67, deputy mayor of Thornbury, said the suspected murder was ‘most out of keeping’ with the quiet market town. Forensic teams were called in after Mr Suddards was found soon after 10am on Monday . Police search the roadside near the vicarage where Mr Suddards was apparently killed . He said: ‘It is a wonderful place to live. I think if you try to find a murder in the history of Thornbury you would have to go 200 years back.’ Mr Suddards had served at St Nicolas . Church in Witham, Essex, since 2001. Before that he served Great Yeldham . parish, 20 miles away, having been ordained in 1989. Rev Simon Garwood, vicar at St Nicolas, said: 'He had served in the area for 10 years and was much loved. 'He was absolutely devoted to the church and worked extremely hard. He gave a lot of himself for the church. 'Many people in the parish are in shock and are trying to digest the news.' John Goodman, Mayor of Witham, said he and his wife had attended the church on special occasions like Christmas. Mr Goodman said: 'He was a very quiet . man who kept himself to himself, but he was devoted to the church and . was a very well-liked rector. 'I’m extremely sad and shocked to hear of his death. The news is gradually trickling through the community and I’m sure many people will feel the same.' 'He was much loved': Rev John Suddards previously worked at St Nicolas Church in Witham, Essex . When . he took up the post at St Nicolas’, Mr Suddards, originally from . Yorkshire, spoke of how he joined the priesthood after an accident. He told the Braintree and Witham Times: 'I used to be a barrister and I had a fairly major road accident and was paraplegic for nine months. 'I was thinking after that and felt strongly that God wanted me to become a priest.' Mr Suddards presided over the marriage of the daughter of Braintree councillor Phil Barlow a week before he left for his new parish. Mr Barlow told the Colchester Gazette: 'I am very saddened. He will be missed by my whole family and everyone who knew him. It is a tragedy.' The Bishop of Gloucester, the Rt Rev Michael Perham, and the Bishop of Tewkesbury, the Rt Rev John Went, issued a joint statement today. The Bishop of Tewkesbury the Rt Rev John Went, with the Archdeacon of Gloucestershire Geoffrey Sidaway (right), addresses journalists after today's memorial service . 'We were shocked and saddened to hear the news that a man's body has been found in Thornbury Vicarage,' they said. 'The Diocese of Gloucester will do everything it can to assist the police in their investigations. 'We are continuing to hold the community in our prayers.' The Bishop of Tewkesbury, the Rightt Reverend . John Went, spoke at a eucharist . service at St Paul's Church in Thornbury today, where he reminded . parishioners they were 'part of a fallen humanity where tragic events . happen'. 'It's good to come and share with you this morning in the eucharist as we come to terms with tragedy,' he said. 'Our . hearts very much go out to you as a church community and a wider . community that will be stunned at this time and will have so much to . come to terms with over the coming months and indeed years.' He told journalists outside the church: 'I was deeply shocked as . the Bishop of Tewkesbury and deeply saddened to hear about John's death . in such tragic circumstances.' Detectives have been carrying out house-to-house enquiries and have also examined CCTV images taken from the nearby Royal George pub . The Archdeacon of Gloucestershire Geoffrey Sidaway outside St Paul's Church following a service held in memory of the dead vicar . Mr Went said he had been due to meet Mr . Suddards this morning to review his ministry after the first few months . of his time in this diocese. The tiny church in a country lane on the edge of the town was packed with people, with the service having been moved from the larger St Mary's Church, which remains behind the police cordon. Curate Bruce Goodwin gave a prayer, saying: 'We come to you (God) in shock and grief and confusion of heart.' Mr Went added in his statement this afternoon: 'As a diocese we are very keen to be here to support the church community. 'So I was thrilled that I was able to be with the church community this morning for a short act of worship and our concern as a diocese is very much to support the church community but also the wider community of Thornbury as they seek to come to terms with this terrible tragedy. 'Our hearts, of course, go out to John's immediate family and his close friends and we shall want as a church to offer all the support and love that they will need as they come to terms with their personal loss over the coming months.'","Reverend John Suddards was found with multiple stab wounds .

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 10:10 AM on 15th February 2012 . Unlike so many in Washington, the House of Representatives and Senate were finally able to find some way to agree on a compromise for the payroll tax cut that gives about $20 a week to average workers. Lawmakers plan to detail their compromise on Wednesday and send it to President Obama later this week. Under the outlines of the emerging agreement, a 2 per cent cut in the Social Security payroll tax would be extended through the end of the year, with the nearly $100billion cost added to the deficit. Declaring it a potential win: The payroll tax cut and renewing jobless benefits were key planks in President Obama's jobs program, which was announced in September . Jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed would be renewed as well, though they have solved at least a portion of where that $30billion total would come from: auctioning broadcast spectrum to wireless companies and requiring federal workers to contribute more toward their pensions. Republican lawmakers said they were told a tentative pact had been reached but said some details could change before the compromise was finalized. They described the session as largely positive, and several predicted the House would approve the deal. The payroll tax cut and renewing jobless benefits were key planks in President Obama's jobs program, which was announced in September. The payroll tax cut benefits 160 million Americans and delivers a tax cut of about $20 a week for a typical worker making $50,000 a year. People making a $100,000 salary would get a $2,000 tax cut. The deal would not only be a win for Mr Obama but would take the payroll tax fight - which put Republicans on the defensive - off the table for the fall election campaign. On the defensive: ¿The mood is to get it off the table,¿ freshman Reppublican Representative Dennis Ross, shown with his trademark taxidermy in the background . ‘The mood is to get it off the table,’ freshman Reppublican Representative Dennis Ross. ‘We've got to move on to another issue.’ ‘It's a compromise,’ said fellow Republican Representative Renee Ellmers, a tea party-backed freshman and one of the bargainers. ‘We knew we'd be making a compromise.’ The agreement also would avert a huge cut in Medicare payments to doctors, financed by cuts elsewhere in the federal health care budget, GOP and Democratic aides said. The cuts include a hitting a ‘prevention fund’ established under Mr Obama's health care law aimed at fighting smoking and obesity. Aides in both parties said Senate Democrats were rebuffed in an effort to renew a package of expired tax breaks for individuals and businesses, including clean energy tax credits cherished by Democrats and a tax break sought by businesses that purchase new equipment. Negotiators agreed to reduce the number of weeks of benefits that workers would be eligible to receive if they lose their jobs. ¿It's a compromise,¿ said Republican Representative Renee Ellmers, a tea party-backed freshman and one of the bargainers . The maximum number of weeks of benefits in states with the highest jobless rates would be cut from 99 weeks to 73 weeks by the end of the year. And in a win for the Hispanic community, Republicans would drop a proposal to require that low-income workers who claim a refundable child tax credit be required to have a Social Security number. The proposal was aimed at blocking illegal immigrants from claiming the credit, but the idea created a firestorm among Hispanics who pointed out that many of the children affected by the cut-off are U.S. citizens. Republicans also were expected to drop a proposal requiring unemployed people to enrol in GED classes to obtain benefits, and a Republican proposal allowing states to employ drug tests as a condition of receiving unemployment benefits would be scrapped as well. Compromise: The House and Senate have agreed to a deal that allows an extension of the payroll tax cut . That said, Republicans won a provision requiring jobless people to be more diligent in job searches as a condition of receiving benefits. Tuesday's developments came just a day after GOP leaders announced that they would relent on a demand that the cost of renewing the payroll tax cut be defrayed by spending cuts elsewhere in the budget. That made it significantly easier for negotiators to come up with savings to pay for the remaining items. President Obama weighed in Tuesday, urging Congress to act immediately to renew both the payroll tax cut and jobless benefits for millions of workers who have been out of work for more than six months. ‘Just pass this middle-class tax cut. Pass the extension of unemployment insurance,’ Mr Obama said at a White House appearance. ‘Do it before it's too late and I will sign it right away.’","The compromise will entail a 2% cut in the Social Security .

"By . Damien Gayle . Last updated at 7:46 AM on 15th February 2012 . A rock which rested inconspicuously on the doorstep of a house for at least 80 years has been revealed as the biggest meteorite ever found to have landed in Britain. The 200lb space rock, which is 1.6ft long, had been sitting by the front door of Lake House, a stately home near Wilsford-cum-Lake, Wiltshire, since the early 1900s. It is thought to have landed on Earth 30,000 years ago. It had been thought that the rock landed in another part of the world before being brought to England by a collector. But researchers now believe that it . actually landed here some 30,000 years ago - making it four times bigger . than any other meteorite found in Britain. Massive: The meteorite from Lake House which, at 1.6ft long and a weight of 200lb, is believed to be the biggest ever discovered to have fallen on Britain . Colin Pillinger, Professor of Planetary Sciences at the Open University, said he was '99.9 per cent' certain that the rock had landed in the UK. 'It's very unusual to find a meteorite this big in Britain,' he said. 'They are very unstable, they contain a lot of metallic iron which oxidises and the meteorite falls to pieces. 'So the only logical explanation of how such a big meteorite may have survived being on Earth for 30,000 years is that it fell on or near a glacier and was in a deep freeze for 20,000 years.' The rock's significance first became apparent in 1991 when the family of the previous owner of Lake House decided to sell the property. They took the specimen - which they called 'grandfather's meteorite' - to the Natural History Museum, but experts could not verify if it had been found in the UK. The family had always assumed that their grandfather had collected the rock on his travels abroad. Stately: Lake House, near Wilsford-cum-Lake, Wiltshire, where the rock sat on the doorstep for 80 years . But Professor Pillinger, who has been . investigating the meteorite's history for more than a year, has now . found photos showing the rock on the steps of the house before the . family owned it. The expert, . famed for his work on the Beagle II Mars explorer, believes the rock . could have landed on Salisbury Plain 30,000 years ago before being . picked up by druids. They . might have used it in the construction of a chalk mound - such as . Silbury Hill near Avebury, Wiltshire, - which would have protected it . from decay, he explained. Professor Pillinger said: 'Along came some druids, scavenging on Salisbury Plain for strange or interesting stones, and it was picked up and used in a chalk mound. 'And the reducing environment of chalk - the anaerobic environment - would have prevented the iron from oxidising.' He believes the giant fragment of asteroid was then unearthed by a previous occupant of Lake House, who added it to his collection of curios. The meteorite, known as a common chondrite, is set to go on display at the Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum in the autumn. Adrian Green, director of the museum, said: 'It's not uncommon for exotic rocks to be built into burial mounds. And it's still covered in chalk which is the bedrock of the landscape. 'And it's colossal - it would take four people to lift it - and it's not aesthetically pleasing, so common sense dictates that this has not been shipped from abroad at ridiculous cost and significant effort, but that it came from the UK.' The rock is on display at the Royal Society in London as part of the Objects in Space exhibition until March 31 .","The rock is four times larger than the next biggest discovered .

"By . Tom Kelly, James Slack and James White . Last updated at 6:06 PM on 14th February 2012 . Abu Qatada could be deported to Jordan if the Government chose to reject a European Court ruling, a former Home Office minister said today. David Mellor said Home Secretary Theresa May should simply ignore the ruling in Strasbourg that prevents Britain throwing out the hate preacher because he could stand trial for terrorism offences involving evidence gathered through torture. Speaking after Qatada was released from prison, he said: 'The ruling in Strasbourg is a gnat-bite that the British Government is totally free in law to ignore. 'There is clearance up to the level of the Supreme Court here to deport . him to Jordan, which is a friendly state with a civilised government. Freed on bail: Hate preacher Abu Qatada is released from Long Lartin Prison under the cover of darkness. It will cost £10,000 per week to keep him safe . A convicted Islamist terrorist is on the run after escaping from house arrest in France. Algerian extremist Said Arif, 46, fled while being held under tight bail conditions at a hotel in the southern city of Millau. His escape will fuel fears Abu Qatada may be helped to freedom from house arrest in Britain. Arif had links to Abu Musab Al Zarqawi, the deceased former leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq, and also met Osama bin Laden at terrorist training camps in Afghanistan in 2000. He was arrested in 2002 for plotting bomb attacks on French targets, and sentenced to ten years in prison in 2007. He was released in December, pending a court ruling on whether to deport him back to Algeria. But - as also in the case of Abu Qatada - European Court of Human Rights has asked for him not to be sent back to his homeland over risks he may be tortured. It was not revealed exactly when former Algerian soldier Arif escaped, but judicial sources said he had not reported to local police under his bail terms since January 22. One official source told French daily paper Le Monde: 'We have no idea at all where he is. He has vanished . His lawyer Sebastien Bono said he had ‘no idea’ where his client was, adding: 'But he has no money and does not have working papers for France.'                                - IAN SPARKS . 'If the Home Secretary chose, as she should, to put him on a plane this . morning and send him back, she would have broken no laws. He blamed 'paralysis' within the coalition for Mrs May’s failure to act. He said: 'A combination of (Justice Secretary) Ken Clarke and the Liberal . Democrats makes this a political fight she feels she cannot win so she . is funking it.' His comments came as another former . Conservative minister added her voice to fears about the threat posed by . Qatada, who was released from prison last night. Former . security minister Baroness Pauline Neville-Jones said of the Islamist . extremist: 'He's unlikely to be much of a risk at the moment under that . degree of surveillance, but what we know is that's not going to be a . permanent situation if an agreement can't be somehow found within three . months with the Jordanian government, so there's a long-term risk there. 'This . is a man who... has a record of preaching real violence. Here's a man . who wished death upon others and I'm less convinced that he's somehow . been neutralised, so we must regard him as a threat.' Her comments came as Qatada's own mother called for him to be kicked out of Britain. Today Home Office minister James . Brokenshire was reported to have boarded a flight to Jordan in a bid to . broker a deal with Qatada's home government to create the right conditions in which Britain could legally deport him. As the Islamic extremist was released from jail, Aisha Othman, 70, speaking from her home in the capital, Amman, insisted: ‘Britain is very wrong to keep my son.’ She . said Qatada, once Osama Bin Laden’s spiritual ambassador in Europe, . would be better off to return home to face trial in Jordan. Call for action: Former Conservative Home Office minister David Mellor, left, said Britain could ignore a European Court ruling and deport Qatada, while Baroness Pauline Neville-Jones said Abu Qatada presented a long-term risk to the country . She said: ‘He has been . away too long. We want him home now. I don’t know why the British keep him. There is no good reason. I can’t see why they would want him.’ Qatada was freed from high-security prison under cover of darkness last night. As well as a 22-hour curfew, he is banned from contacting a list of terrorists including Al Qaeda chief Ayman Al Zawahiri and hook-handed hate preacher Abu Hamza. Ministers are desperate to deport him and are pinning their hopes on a promise by Jordan to ban the use in terror trials of evidence obtained by torture. The prospect of Qatada, who is also known as Omar Othman, being prosecuted using evidence obtained by ill-treatment led to the European Court of Human Rights ruling he must not be deported. In turn, Strasbourg’s judgment led directly to the UK courts releasing him on bail yesterday. He is wanted in Jordan in connection with plotting a terrorist atrocity to mark the millennium. In an exclusive interview, Mrs Othman insisted her son was not a terrorist. But his brother and a close friend revealed how he was in regular phone contact with Osama Bin Laden until 2001 and thought the late Al Qaeda leader was a ‘wise man’. Bring him back: Qatada's mother Aisha Othman, right, said her son should be allowed to return to Jordan. The ramshackle family home in Jordan, left . Hate preacher: Qatada pictured walking the streets of West London before he went to prison . They said Qatada supported jihadist groups in Algeria and Libya but denied he had any involvement in terror attacks in Jordan. His younger brother, Ibrahim Abu Omar Othman, 32, said he wanted Qatada to return to Jordan. ‘I . wish very much to have him back, of course, but I am worried he will be . tortured if he returns if there is not a special agreement to say he . cannot be harmed and that he will have fair treatment by the . authorities,’ he added. ‘I am very uncertain about whether that is possible.’ He last spoke to Qatada two months ago when the preacher telephoned the family home from prison. ‘We are concerned about him, but he is a strong man who did not complain to us about prison life. ‘He will be much happier to be out though, I am certain about that.’ Qatada’s best friend from school, Hassan Abu Hanyiah, said: ‘He spoke to Bin Laden many, many times by phone, although they never met in person because they were never in the same country together. Left-wing newspaper The Guardian today added its voice to the overwhelming calls for Abu Qatada to be deported from Britain. Despite its traditional pro-mass immigration stance, the newspaper acknowledged that 'there is not a soul in this country who thinks that Britain is a better place for the presence of Abu Qatada.' In a leader article, it said: 'The case for deportation from this country is immensely strong.' It went on: 'Deportation of Abu Qatada would clearly be the better course... Britain would like to deport Abu Qatada to Jordan. Ideally this should happen.' However, The Guardian also celebrates the fact Qatada was released from prison because he has never been charged with a criminal offence in this country, calling his detention an abuse of the 'rule of law'. ‘Before September 11, speaking to Bin Laden was not a big deal. ‘He admired Bin Laden as a wise man who knew many things. He liked and respected him a lot.’ While fighting deportation, Qatada, 51, has been held for six-and-a-half years, more than any other detainee in modern immigration history. As ministers continued to work frantically to strike an extradition deal with Jordan, Downing Street left open the door to defying Strasbourg and simply putting Qatada on a plane. Such a move – while hugely popular with the British public and Tory MPs – would bring the Government into open conflict with Europe. But, asked whether Britain could ignore the ruling, the Prime Minister’s spokesman said: ‘We are committed to removing him from the country. We want to see him deported. We are looking at all the options for doing that.’ The comments from Number Ten came as Tory MPs continued to heap pressure on the Prime Minister to remove Qatada. They point out other countries, including Italy and France, have kicked out terror suspects in clear defiance of the court’s rulings. Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘The . lawyers have haggled and quibbled long enough. Qatada is a threat to . public protection and should be put on a flight back to Jordan. No ifs, . no buts.’ And Tory MP Robert . Halfon accused Strasbourg of subverting the original founding principles . of the European Convention on Human Rights. The . taxpayer will have to find up to £10,000 a week to help protect Qatada . from vigilante attacks now that he has been released. Police . surveillance will require 60 officers a day divided over three shifts to . keep a 24-hour watch on him. James Brokenshire, the security . minister, is due to fly to Jordan to gain necessary assurances that will . allow the UK to deport Qatada. The case has become so sensitive that officials will not say publicly when the talks will take place. Lord Carlile, the government’s former reviewer of terror laws, said: ‘This should all have been sorted out long ago. Freed: Radical Muslim cleric Abu Qatada was being held at Long Lartin, in Worcestershire, until he was released last night . Held: Once described by a judge as Osama Bin Laden's right-hand man in Europe, Qatada, 51, was in a van which left the high-security Long Lartin prison in Evesham, Worcestershire, (pictured) for his London home at about 9.15pm . ‘The incredulity of the public and the media is entirely justified. We have to find a way of making him leave. ‘There are legal rule of law ways of achieving that, it’s a pity it wasn’t done before.’ Yvette Cooper, the shadow Home Secretary, said: ‘As soon as the European Court judgement was delivered a month ago now the Government could have appealed the decision and begun urgent negotiations with the Jordanian government. Instead the Government did nothing.’","Just ignore Strasbourg ruling and kick him out, David Mellor tells Home Secretary .

A thug who repeatedly slammed a door on a police dog’s head walked free from court with just a community order. The wounded German Shepherd was one of only seven dogs working for the Metropolitan Police which are trained to abseil in firearms situations. Polish Lukasz Sklepkowski, 29, trapped the animal, named Zinzan, as officers were searching for lost property in Edgware, north London, last October. It suffered severe bruising in the attack. Sklepkowski was found guilty in his . absence after he failed to turn up for his case at Hendon Magistrates’ Court in north-west London last December. He was later arrested after handing himself in to police and was sentenced yesterday. The incident took place when police searching for lost property were told that the Pole was hiding in bushes. Sklepkowski ran off and ignored officers’ calls to stop, Zinzan and his handler chased him to a nearby flat frequented by drug users. As Zinzan tried to follow him inside, Sklepkowski trapped the dog’s neck in the door and slammed it several times. After a struggle to prise the door open, officers managed to free the wounded dog, surround the property and arrest the Pole. The animal was later rushed to a vet for treatment. Wounded: Zinzan who suffered severe bruising in the attack and his handler PC Dan Revill . Zinzan’s handler, Pc Dan Revill, said he had now 'thankfully' made a full recovery and described him as being 'pretty chilled out'. He said: 'He had severe bruising to his head and neck and was on the strongest painkillers available while he recovered. 'He was reluctant to leave me for the first week, but we gave him a week of light training to ease him back to work and he has now returned to full duties.' Sklepkowski, of no fixed address, was yesterday given a 12-month community order. He was also . sentenced to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work and ordered to pay £300 . costs and £50 towards vets bills. He was found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering under the Animal Welfare Act.","Thug skipped court but was found guilty in his absence .

"By . Amy Oliver . Last updated at 8:14 AM on 15th February 2012 . On trial: Davina Travi, 42, arrives at Bournemouth Crown Court charged with sexually assaulting two underage boys . A mother-of-five had sex with two underage boys as a reward for them vandalising a love-rival’s car, a court has heard. Davina Travi, 42, from Bournemouth, Dorset, ‘struck a deal’ with the schoolboys aged 13 and 14 after she was dumped by her boyfriend for another woman, it is alleged. She is said to have asked them to damage the car of his new girlfriend Stacey Allright in return for sex. In April 2010 the teenagers found Miss Allright’s Peugeot 306 and smashed it up bringing Travi the number plate to prove they had kept their end of the deal, it was said. Travi was 'as good as her word' and allegedly had full sex with the older boy in her bedroom before summoning the second one up. Her children, two of whom are thought to be the same age as the victims, were not at home at the time of the alleged incidents. The court heard that after having sex with the boys Travi threw the pair out. But she continued to keep in contact with the teenagers by sending them sexual text messages while they were at school, it was alleged. Bournemouth Crown Court heard evidence she had been in touch with one of the boys, either by phone call or text, 548 times in the space of several months. It was said she formulated a secret code with both boys and would text them three question marks if she wanted to have sex. She ended up bedding the younger boy at least one more time, it was claimed. It was only when the girlfriend of one of the teenagers discovered what had happened that they were encouraged to tell a school social worker five months later. Travi was arrested and charged with sexually assaulting the teenagers who are now 15 and 16. Stephen Dent, prosecuting, told the court the boys were part of a group of school pupils who used to visit her house and drink alcohol and smoke cigarettes. He said: 'Davina Travi treated children like adults. She was allowing them to drink and smoke in her house. 'That irresponsible attitude came to a peak when she decided to use them to get back at her former boyfriend by bribing them to damage his girlfriend’s car for the reward of having sex with her; a reward that she gave them.' Mr Dent said the school later became aware Travi was hosting parties for pupils and warned other parents not to let their children go there. He added there was no suggestion the boys had been raped and that they had been willing participants, but were not legally capable of giving their consent. He said: 'At the age of 13 a lot of boys have hormones coursing through their veins and are perfectly capable and willing to have sex but they are mentally immature. 'They are not able to properly decide whether they should have sex and they are unable to deal with the potential consequences.' Travi denies three charges of sexual activity with a child. The trial continues.","Boys aged 13 and 14 'smashed up Peugeout 306 and then slept with Davina Travi'

"By . Emily Allen . Last updated at 3:46 AM on 16th February 2012 . Heavy snow has caused more damage to the crumbling Colosseum in Rome putting the iconic monument under even more strain. The damage has meant the famous attraction has had to close its doors to the public, disappointing thousands of tourists. Other buildings in the historic walled town of Urbino have also started to deteriorate under the weight of snow. Exceptional weather: Experts have been surveying the damage to the Colosseum this week and are trying to work out ways to stop further movement . About 7,000 people a day visit the Colosseum - a 50,000-seat amphitheatre completed in 80 AD and used for gladiator contests and mock sea battles in the Italian capital - paying 12 euros each for a ticket. It is already in dire need of restoration and is due to undergo a long-delayed 25million euro restoration this year. In December slabs of ancient lime plaster fell from the 2000-year-old attraction on Christmas Day and Boxing Day putting staff on high alert for more falling debris. However, the latest erosion has been caused by an exceptionally large amount of snow this year, the weight of which has put pressure on the building. Roman roads: An aerial view showing the snow-covered Colosseum, which was closed to tourists earlier this month. It is due to re-open on Thursday . Freezing temperatures led to ice . forming on the walls of the monument, expanding and pushing the external . plaster masonry causing pieces to crumble. If the pieces fall from a certain height they could pose a risk to visitors. Locals say this year has been the coldest in Italy for 30 years. When the snow fell earlier this month the city ground to a halt as . buses struggled to climb icy hills and authorities accustomed to a warm . climate fought to cope. As well as the Colosseum, visitors were also stopped from entering the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill, . the former home of Rome's ancient emperors, over fears they could slip . on ice. Rome had not seen heavy snow in 26 years. The last substantial snowfalls in Rome . were in 1985 and 1986, though there have been other cases of lighter . snow since then, including in 2010. Experts have been surveying the damage to the Colosseum this week and are trying to work out ways to stop further movement. Under strain: Heavy snow has caused extensive damage to the medieval walled town of Urbino and further deteriorated the Colosseum in Rome which is badly in need of repair . Rossella Rea, archaeologist and . superintendent of the Colosseum, told CNN: 'Tests and evaluation of the . damage is still ongoing, especially on the second level of arches.' The building is expected to re-open to the public on Thursday. David Pickles, senior architect at English Heritage, said the damage was an extreme version of the natural wear and tear buildings face during everyday weather. Meanwhile, in Urbino, two convents have had structural problems following the bad weather and the roof of the Church of the Capuchins has also caved in. The town's cathedral is also shut following water damage and there are concerns about some historic homes which have wooden joists and delicate roofs might now need additional support. Italian environmental group Legambiente has frequently raised the alarm about the venue's precarious state. It claims car fumes and vibrations from a nearby subway are damaging its travertine exterior and brick and tufa interior.","Experts trying to stop further movement after exceptional snowfall .

As they watched a giant beast lurching through the water in outer Siberia, experts thought they had found evidence that the extinct woolly mammoth was alive and well. But the dramatic footage is a hoax the documentary maker who made the recording has revealed. Lou Petho filmed the video himself - minus the woolly mammoth - and said someone had doctored his footage. Scroll down to see the videos . Woolly Mammoth? A still from the video that purportedly shows a prehistoric elephant crossing a river in Siberia, Russia. The footage is a hoax . Hoax: The original footage, filmed by Lou Petho, shows the lake without the non-existent woolly mammoth . Divided opinion: Believers said they can see reddish-brown 'wool' or fur and clear white tusks. In reality, it was computer-generated . Inconclusive: The footage, reportedly taken by a government worker who was out surveying planned roadworks, is too grainy for anyone to get a good look at the creature . It was claimed the clip was caught by a government engineer in Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, Siberia. The video appeared to show an elephant-shaped animal with reddish-brown fur - which . would match the colour of mammoth hair dug up from the perma-frost in . frozen Russia - and a trunk dragging in the river. In reality the animal was nothing . more than a computer creation and the footage was recorded as part of a . documentary and captured by Mr Petho during a five-day trek. Leo Petho said in a video he . published on YouTube: 'I was alerted to the fact that a character by the . name of Michael Cohen took hold of some of my footage without knowing . it and created an elaborate hoax on the public.' He . added: 'They took this video and, through CGI I imagine, created a . woolly mammoth crossing a river. I did not give them permission to do . this.' He accused them of 'staling' people's footage and 'creating a lie with it' and profiting from it. Suspicious trunk: The mammoth's distinctive trunk seems to straighten out in some stills and hang lank in others - because a poor job had been done of the hoax . It looks a litle something like this: A replica of a woolly mammoth on display at the Royal British Columbia Museum in Victoria, British Columbia. Woolly mammoths roamed North America, Europe, and Asia . Paranormal writer Michael Cohen, 41, said at the time: 'It is highly possible that a number of species, . extinct elsewhere, survive in the area.' And he explained that the discovery of extinct animals still alive in Siberia would not be music to the ears of the Russian government. He added: 'If surviving woolly mammoths were found in Siberia, it could run against . Russia's plans to further develop and exploit the area's considerable . resources.' There is evidence of the woolly mammoth living up to 150,000 years ago across northern North America and Eurasia, with the best preserved carcasses in Siberia. But the species had disappeared at the end of the Pleistocene era (10,000 years ago), with an isolated population still living on Siberian Wrangel Island until around 1,700BC.

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . Last updated at 8:41 AM on 2nd December 2011 . It was a code-cracking puzzle designed to attract the brightest young minds in the country. But those who successfully worked out the . UK intelligence agency's secret message could have been forgiven for struggling to get . their head around the point of the whole process. After cracking the complex code . they were redirected to a job application they could have found far more . easily using a simple Google search. And furthermore, the salary for the . role at GCHQ is a mere £25,000 - less than half of what candidates could . earn in the private sector, a former employee told the Daily . Telegraph. Can you crack it? The key word uncovered in this grid of letters and numbers could lead to a career in the secret service . Moving with the times: It is hoped the online code-cracking competition will draw out potential cyber spies more efficiently . In response to increased threats from cyber crime, the Government agency decided to throw open its recruitment process to self-taught hackers and mathematical geniuses who have not been educated at Oxbridge. GCHQ launched the online code-cracking competition in a bid to seek out the next generation of internet-savvy spies with the hope they can help protect the country from the growing problem of cyber crime. But within hours of the code being posted online this morning 'a number of people' had appeared to have solved it, the Daily Telegraph said. One - a 23-year-old who had left GCHQ for a role in the private sector - claimed that the the secret service's inability to match salaries from big corporations was the reason is faced staffing problems. He told the newspaper: 'There is an incredibly high turnover at GCHQ and that is imply down to pay. 'Those who can do this challenge could easily earn up to £80,000 a year in the private sector. 'It's disappointing that as a society we are not willing to acknowledge those skills by improving their pay.' It is thought the GCHQ's modern approach . will enable the agency to quickly identify those with the right skills . for espionage in the computer age. The puzzle is featured on an unbranded website with the domain name canyoucrackit.co.uk. Competitors are then faced with a . grid of apparently random numbers and letters along with a countdown . clock. They are then given seven hours to unscramble the code to reveal a . secret keyword. A GCHQ spokesman said: 'The target audience for this particular campaign is one that may not . typically be attracted to traditional advertising methods and may be . unaware that GCHQ is recruiting for these kinds of roles. 'Their skills may be ideally suited to our work and yet they may not . understand how they could apply them to a working environment, . particularly one where they have the opportunity to contribute so much.' Spy games: Players who crack the code are directed to the website for the GCHQ (pictured) and invited to apply for a job . Those who successfully crack the code . will be automatically redirected to the GCHQ website's recruitment page . and invited to apply for a job. They could then be fast-tracked to a . career in the secret service. The agency launched the recruitment . campaign as an internet 'viral', spread via social networking sites - . such as Facebook and Twitter - and blogs. It is hoped the campaign will lead . the GCHQ to a previously-untapped source of mathematical whizz kids, . with the capabilities to help protect the country from increasing levels . of cyber crime. In a departure from its traditional method of recruiting graduates directly from the universities of Oxbridge, the agency now looking beyond this enlistment pool to include candidates who could be self-taught hackers. The campaign comes after concerns . were raised by the Intelligence and Security Committee about the GCHQ's . 'inability to retain a suitable cadre of internet specialists' to . respond to cyber threats, it said in an annual report. Earlier this year Foreign Secretary William Hague said there had been an 'exponential rise' in incidents, with systems such as welfare and tax databases 'liable to attack'. 'Countries that cannot maintain cyber security of their banking system, of the intellectual property of their companies, will be at a serious disadvantage in the world,' Mr Hague said. In October Iain Lobban, who runs GCHQ, warned that sensitive data had been targeted and that the 'UK's continued economic well-being' was under threat. He said sensitive data on government computers had been targeted, along with defence, technology and engineering firms' designs. He revealed there had been 'one significant (but unsuccessful) attempt on the Foreign Office and other government departments this summer'. A new Government Joint Cyber Unit is . to focus on the growing threat of cyber attacks from organised . criminals, hackivists, terrorists and hostile states. Applicants must be British-born citizens but anyone who has previously illegally hacked would be ineligible.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:13 PM on 16th February 2012 . The family of a Russian billionaire has closed on a New York City penthouse apartment for $88 million. The penthouse formerly owned by Sanford I. Weill, the former head of Citigroup Inc, was bought by a trust for the daughter of former fertiliser magnate Dmitry Rybolovlev, student Ekaterina. Most 22-year-olds can't even imagine having a foot on the property ladder - let alone one that costs $88million, but Miss Rybolovleva, a student at an undisclosed U.S. university, will live in the ten-room palace with wrap around terraces when she is in New York. Owner: Ekaterina Rybolovleva, 22 - an avid equestrian - has bought the $88million apartment herself on New York's Central Park . Russian fertiliser tycoon Dmitry Rybolovlev, 43, bought Manhattan's most expensive apartment for his daughter. The President of the football club AS Monaco, he is pictured here at a match earlier this week . The sale of the apartment breaks records for an individual transaction in a city renowned for pricey property. The Wall Street Journal says the sale generated nearly $2.5 million in city and state taxes. The brokers' commission alone came to about $3.5 million and the deal closed on Wednesday. When the sale went into contract in December a representative for Miss Rybolovleva . confirmed the planned purchase with a statement saying: 'A company associated with Ekaterina . Rybolovleva, daughter of a well-known businessman Dmitriy Rybolovleva, . has signed a contract to purchase an apartment at 15 Central Park West, . New York. 'The apartment is a condominium currently owned by the Sanford Weill Family. 'Ms Rybolovleva is currently studying at a U.S. university. She plans to stay in the apartment when visiting New York.

New York part time in the $88million apartment while she is studying . Her father is one of the small group of Russians who became fabulously wealthy during the post-Soviet privatization of the economy and are known as oligarchs. He is the former owner of fertilizer business Uralkali. The mining magnate is locked in a bitter divorce battle with wife Elena, to whom he has been married for 23 years. They have two daughters. In court papers, Mrs Rybolovleva, 43, has accused her husband of serial infidelity and could be set to get $3.5billion in the divorce. But the 6,744 sq ft ten-room will be safe from his ex-wife as the contract is in their daughter's name. In 2008,  Mr Rybolovlev, 43, bought Donald Trump's 33,000 sq ft Florida estate - Maison L'Amitie - for $95million in cash. He is also poised to take control of French football team AS Monaco, used to run Russia's largest potash fertiliser company Uralkali. He is listed as the 93rd richest person in the world.

Mr Weill said when it went on the market that the proceeds would be donated to charity. Miss Rybolovleva is following in the footsteps of Petra Ecclestone, who earlier this year bought the spelling mansion, which was listed at a selling price of $150million - America's most expensive home. The 22-year-old British heiress is said to have bought it for a mere $85million.

Now, just over a year later, Osmany is returning from Afghanistan to attend his brother's funeral after Osbrany was killed on Friday while serving in Helmand Province. 'They were always talking about the Marines,' said the boys' uncle Andriano  Moreta. Osbrany Mondesdeoca, 20, joined with his twin brother the Marines shortly after high school, pursuing a long-time dream . 'It's what they always wanted to do,' he told The Star Ledger. The Department of Defense said that he died while supporting combat missions, but other reports say that Osbrany was shot by a sniper just moments after stepping off of the Marine base in Helmand. On Monday, his 20-year-old identical twin brother Osmany flew back to their hometown of North Arlington, New Jersey, from his post in Afghanistan. The twins' older brother Sandro Moreta, 22, also enlisted in the Marines though a few months after his younger brothers. Identical: Osmany (left) and Osbrany (right) Montesdoca- seen with their . respective girlfriends- enlisted at the same time as one another . In love: On his Facebook wall, Osbrany says that his girlfriend Maria Samaniego (left) was the 'love of my life' When Osbrany was killed, Sandro had not yet been deployed so his trip home was shorter, though no less painful. Just 10 days before his untimely death, Osbrany had been promoted to the position of Lance Corporal and seemed thrilled with his job. 'He truly loved what he was doing,' his aunt Teresa said. That was also evident on his Facebook page, where he wrote favourably about his chosen path. 'I do have a future, I am a United States Marines (sic),' Osbrany wrote. A heartbreaking end: Osbrany was one of four boys in his family, three of whom were in the military as the youngest is still in high school . The youngest Montes De Oca brother, Franklin, is still in high school in northern New Jersey. He was clearly upset about his brother's death. 'He was a great guy. He was a hero,' Franklin told CBS. 'He was the best man I knew.' Osbrany's . two brothers who are still serving in the military were given the . option to leave their service, but both declined, opting to continue. This is much to the dismay of their mother, Miriam, who is distraught over her son's death. 'She said her mind is going crazy,' Franklin said for his mother, who only speaks Spanish. Remaining: Franklin Monte De Oca is the youngest of the four brothers . She told Franklin to tell other mothers not to send their sons to war. She also said that they must receive more training before being put into combat areas. 'She never got a chance to sleep. She's been crying all night.' Flags flew at half-mast in North Arlington on Wednesday, as Osbrany's passing marks the 42nd death of a service member in Afghanistan since 2001.","Osbrany Montes De Oca, 20, enlisted with his brother Osmany over a year ago just after they graduated from high school in New Jersey .

A severely malnourished 15-year-old girl was allegedly forced to live in the basement of a home by her parents for years while they beat her, starved her and even forced her to eat her own faeces. The Wisconsin teenager had been forced to live in the house’s basement by her father, 40, and stepmother, 42, for six years and an alarm would sound if she went upstairs, police said. She was found barefoot in pyjamas near her home last week and allegedly ate what she could find on the floor and in the rubbish, but her parents forced her to eat her faeces and drink her own urine. Mugshots: Melinda Drabek-Chritton, left, and Chad Chritton, right, were arrested in connection with the case . The girl weighed just 70lbs when she was brought into a hospital and a doctor there told police she was under a ‘significant risk of death’ and chronic starvation caused her puberty to be arrested. Dr Barbara Knox, of American Family . Children's Hospital in Madison, also said the girl would be at high risk . for other disorders and complications that can lead to death, according . to an affidavit. Investigation: Joshua Drabek, 18, was also arrested by local police for an alleged probation violation . Someone notified police after seeing the . girl barefoot in her pyjamas last Monday. The girl claimed she fled her . home because she was afraid her stepmother was going to throw her down . the stairs. Her stepmother and father were named by the Wisconsin State Journal as Melinda Drabek-Chritton and Chad Chritton. The girl told police she was let out of the basement to ‘clean some papers’ for her stepmother, who became angry because she wasn't doing it fast enough and threatened to throw her down the stairs. The couple were arrested on Friday on . suspicion of child abuse and neglect, and a judge set their bail on . Tuesday at $20,000 each, reported the Wisconsin State Journal. Joshua Drabek, the girl's 18-year-old stepbrother was also arrested for an alleged probation violation, reported the newspaper. The girl, who is not enrolled in public or private school, lived in the same house as her parents, older stepbrother and two younger stepchildren - but everyone apart from her in the home lived upstairs, reported Fox affiliate WFXS. One doctor said the girl suffered 'serial child torture with prolonged exposure to definite starvation'. If she was ever caught eating without her parents' permission, she was . allegedly forced to vomit it up. In court: The girl told police she was let out of the basement to 'clean some papers' for Drabek-Chritton, who became angry because she wasn't doing it fast enough and threatened to throw her down the stairs . Ran away: The girl told police she was let out of the basement of the home on this Wisconsin street to 'clean some papers' for her stepmother, who became angry because she wasn't doing it fast enough . A hearing was set for Thursday to review the bail and talk to the judge about the charges, Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne said - adding that he can't say when charges might be filed. '(The victim) stated the primary reason . she fled the house that day is it appeared this defendant was going to . throw her down the stairs' Assistant District Attorney Matt Moeser . The girl's father initially gave police medical explanations for her condition - but a hospital social worker told authorities there was likely much more to the case, a police spokesman said. ‘(The victim) stated the primary reason . she fled the house that day is it appeared this defendant was going to . throw her down the stairs,’ Assistant District Attorney Matt Moeser . said, reported Morgan Murphy Media news website Channel 3000.

Shocked: Mike Vega points to the area of sidewalk in Madison, Wisconsin, where he discovered the starving 15-year-old . The Madison Police Department is investigating a significant child abuse and neglect case involving a 15-year old girl. The amount of information being made public is limited as this case is continuing to unfold at the time of this writing. The initial contacts with law enforcement began on the afternoon of Monday, February 6th when a passerby found the girl walking outside, without shoes or socks, clad only in pajamas. The victim was a couple of blocks from her house, and in obvious need of help. The concerned citizen notified McFarland Police who in turn summoned McFarland EMS to evaluate the malnourished teen. She was transported to a Madison hospital. A passerby found the girl walking outside, without shoes or socks, clad only in pajamas . It was determined this was a Madison case. The MPD was contacted and a patrol officer responded to the hospital to gather information. From the onset, it was clear the 70-pound girl was dramatically underweight. The child’s father provided medical explanations for her physical condition. On Wednesday, February 8th, a hospital social worker provided information to the MPD indicating there was likely much more to the case, and the investigation escalated. A doctor, who specializes in child abuse, examined the teen on Friday, February 10th, and diagnosed her condition as, “serial child torture with prolonged exposure to definite starvation.” A forensic interview was conducted at . Safe Harbor Child Advocacy Center on Friday, February 10th. The Safe . Harbor interview provided probable cause to make 3 arrests. Late on . Friday the child’s 40-year old father and 42-year old stepmother were . arrested on tentative charges of Child Neglect. In addition, the 18-year . old step brother was arrested on a Probation and Parole hold. She was forced to spend most of her time in the basement, . without a bathroom, and being given very little to eat . In summary: Detectives learned she lived with her father, a stepmother, an adult step-brother, and two younger stepchildren. While the rest of the family resided upstairs, she was forced to spend most of her time in the basement, without a bathroom, and being given very little to eat. There was an alarm that would sound if she went upstairs. A search warrant was executed on the family’s Southeast Side home Monday afternoon, February 13th. Potential evidence was seized. Interviews and evidence gathering continue. The MPD has had prior calls regarding members of the family. One case, in 2007, involved the victim. An unnamed party alleged the girl may have been molested by a family member. The girl did not corroborate the allegation during the investigation by the MPD. At the time, she appeared healthy, and her family was unwilling to cooperate with a MPD detective. The detective told other involved agencies that if the child was to make future disclosures pertaining to the allegation that the detective should be contacted so the investigation could proceed. No further information was brought to the MPD. The child is currently not enrolled in a public or private school. The MPD is working closely with many agencies on this case.

"By . Lee Moran . Last updated at 1:10 PM on 15th February 2012 . Allies of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez have started a smear campaign against the country's new opposition leader - by questioning his sexuality and mocking his Jewish roots. A torrent of abuse was directed at Henrique Capriles just minutes after his landslide win at the Democratic Unity coalition's primary election on Sunday. And it shows no sign of stopping - indicating that the battle for power in the October 7 presidential election will be fiercely fought. Smear: Allies of Hugo Chavez (left) are trying to discredit Henrique Capriles (right) who on Sunday was named as the leader of the opposition . With Chavez himself uncharacteristically quiet, senior officials and state media have led the attack, denouncing Capriles - a 39-year-old state governor who wants to be Venezuela's youngest leader - as 'bourgeois' and 'fascist.' Congress leader Diosdado Cabello, a former military comrade and longtime staunch supporter of the socialist president, said: 'Now we know who is the candidate of imperialism, of capitalism and the right wing. The anti-patriotic candidate has a face. He won't have an easy election campaign.' Capriles - the grandson of Jews who survived the World War Two Holocaust in Poland - defines himself as a centre-left 'progressive' who admires Brazil's 'modern left' model of free-market economics with a strong social conscience. The attacks against him foreshadow a tough election battle in the polarised South American OPEC member nation, where Chavez has strong support among the poor and denounces opponents as representatives of a discredited, super-rich elite. Celebration: Henrique Capriles' supporters go wild after he won the opposition presidential primary election in Caracas, Venezuela, on Sunday . The most furious accusations have come from state media commentator Mario Silva, who often targets Chavez's foes on his late night TV show, The Razorblade. Silva insulted opposition leaders and then read out a purported police document reporting Capriles was caught in a car having sex with another man in 2000. Capriles denied the allegation and said the document was falsified. Police have not commented. Another state radio commentator, Adal Hernandez, wrote a vitriolic profile of Capriles, highlighting his Jewish family background and titled The Enemy is Zionism. Capriles, a practicing Catholic, has not responded to the profile. One cartoon, retweeted today by a senior Chavez aide, showed Capriles in pink shorts with a Swastika on his arm, squaring up to a much larger, muscular Chavez. He often talks emotionally of his grandparents' escape from Nazi repression. Capriles comes from a wealthy family but pointedly spends more time in a T-shirt in shantytowns than in his office, and he is seeking to project himself as above the mud-slinging. There is a way: Henrique Capriles won nearly two-thirds of the 3 million votes cast in Sunday's primary . Capriles, who won nearly two-thirds of the 3 million votes cast in Sunday's primary, said: 'I wasn't elected to fight with anyone but to solve problems. 'The only confrontation I want is against violence, unemployment, corruption and other problems in Venezuela.' Much of the official ire against Capriles has focused on Sunday's primary, saying the overall numbers were inflated to give an impression of massive opposition turnout - even though the state electoral authority supervised the poll. Hugo Chavez’s 14-year-old daughter Rosines sparked outrage last month when she posted a picture of herself online peering out from behind a wad of dollars. Twitter, Facebook and other social media sites seethed with resentment from people who said they had been unable to change bolívares, the local currency, because of government limits on the amount of dollars that can be bought at the official, fixed rate. Some Twitter users mocked her photo by taking photos of themselves flaunting everyday items, calling the craze #rosinesing. Others contrasted the image of Rosinés peeking behind the bills with her father's rhetoric against capitalism and consumerism. Some satirised the photo by substituting the dollars for cooking oil, coffee, sugar and other staples that occasionally become scarce in Venezuela. The photo is the second time Rosines has made headlines for allegedly flaunting her family's lavish lifestyle, the first being when she posted a photo of herself meeting pop star Justin Bieber. Critics claimed this showed a glimpse of the family's exalted lifestyle. Chavez supporters have also demanded to know the source of Capriles' campaign financing, implying pro-U.S interests have been backing him. The Democratic Unity candidate has responded that his books are open for all to see. Adding to the charged atmosphere, the Supreme Court ordered the opposition yesterday not to burn voter registration books from Sunday's vote - a measure they had promised to counter fears there could be retribution. The government for years discriminated against Venezuelans whose names were on a list of people who requested a recall referendum on Chavez's rule, blocking them from jobs, state loans and in some cases even entrance to government buildings. Opposition leaders said the court's order was issued too late, and the lists of voters' names had already been burned. Capriles has criticised one-sided coverage by state media, accusing it of routinely ignoring protests about crime and water shortages while extensively reporting 'every time a mango falls on a roof' in the state of Miranda where he is governor. He travelled to the Caribbean island of Margarita yesterday to visit a shrine and give thanks for his primary victory. Capriles says his religious conviction grew during four months in jail in 2004 after a riot outside the Cuban Embassy which he was accused - but later acquitted - of fomenting. Analysts say the finally united opposition - which in the past has been crippled by in-fighting and failed to dislodge Chavez via mass street protests or a string of votes - has its best chance in 13 years of unseating him in October. Yet the president still appears to have the edge, thanks to high popularity among the poor, a formidable party machine and an extraordinary pre-election spending spree on welfare projects like allowances for single mothers and pensioners. Recent polls show Chavez would win about 60 per cent of the vote in October, though analysts say that could change if Capriles runs a dynamic campaign. He plans to start a tour of Venezuela from next week. The Eurasia Group political risk consultancy said Capriles was a competitive candidate because he was young, less connected to the country's old political class and the governor of an important state who enjoyed high approval ratings. 'We don't think this will be enough to defeat Chavez, but it points to the fact that the election could be tighter than most anticipate, and that there could be some volatility in terms of expectations in the run up to the election,' it said.","Henrique Capriles, 39, won Democratic Unity primary election on Sunday .

The coalition dropped two bombs on February 8 in Najrab district in Kapisa province, after movements by eight people on the ground were assessed as a threat to Afghan police and Nato forces in the area. Air Commodore Mike Wigston, the director of Nato air operations, said today that the international forces believed they were 'young teenagers' who were armed. Apology: U.S. Brigadier General Lewis Boone (left) and Air Commodore Mike Wigston voice regret for the killing of eight civilians in an airstrike in eastern Afghanistan last week. They were speaking at a press conference in Kabul . U.S. General John Allen, the top commander in Afghanistan, has met with the provincial governor to express his condolences. Wigston said coalition officials did not reach . the village until two days after the airstrike. By then, the victims had . been buried. He said local officials showed the assessment team . photographs of the corpses. Forensic experts, who examined the . photographs, said the victims were young teenagers around 15 years old . and one was older, Wigston said. The top commander in Afghanistan today condemned the Taliban's use of child suicide bombers as 'utterly despicable'. U.S. General John Allen (pictured) was speaking after two ten-year-olds were arrested wearing explosive vests for a second time. The children were apprehended in Kandahar province along with three other militants last week. General Allen said in a statement:  'The cold tactic of using any human being - especially children - to conduct suicide attacks is utterly despicable, and I denounce these tactics. 'In now promoting child-suicide attacks, the insurgency have forfeited any remaining support they may have had with the people of Afghanistan. 'We stand side by side with the Afghan people to do everything we can to eliminate suicide bombers of any age from the cities, towns and villages throughout the country.' Zalmai Ayubi, a Kandahar province spokesman, yesterday confirmed that the ten-year-olds were previously arrested by security forces wearing explosive vests last August. Along with 18 other children, the pair were pardoned by Afghan President Hamid Karzai. 'These were young Afghans - . adult-sized. I have no doubt that they were carrying weapons,' Wigston . said, adding that it's not unusual for villagers to carry weapons. Local authorities said those who died were seven boys between the ages of six and 14 and a mentally-ill young man aged around 18 to 20. Wigston said: 'We may never know what they were . doing lined up under that rock that day. I'm not saying they . were Taliban. I'm not saying they were insurgents. 'They weren't bombed . because they were Taliban, or because they were insurgents or smugglers. They were bombed because we thought they were a threat.' Civilian casualties have long been a source of friction between the U.S.-led international force and Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who condemned the bombing and sent a delegation to the scene to investigate. Army Brigadier General Lewis Boone, director of public affairs for the coalition, said: 'The aircraft dropped two bombs on the group that we believed to be an imminent threat to our people. 'Despite all tactical directives being followed precisely, we now know the unfortunate result of this engagement. In the end, eight young Afghans lost their lives in this very sad event.' Coalition and Afghan security forces were searching the area for weapons and ammunition, he said. Using binoculars and other equipment, ground forces identified several groups of Afghan males leaving a village at different times and going in different directions. One group of eight headed for nearby mountains, Boone said. 'They were observed moving in open terrain in a tactical fashion, clearly keeping distance from each other. 'Their purposeful movements and the weapons they were seen to be carrying led the ground commander to believe this group was getting ready to attack and were an imminent threat to the Afghan National Police and coalition forces in the valley.' People react seconds after a suicide blast targeting a Shi'ite Muslim gathering in Kabul in December. The top Nato commander in Afghanistan today condemned the Taliban's use of child suicide bombers as 'utterly despicable' Hussain Khan Sanjani, the leader of the Kapisa provincial council who visited the area, said residents told him that before the airstrike, coalition aircraft were patrolling overhead as other forces searched homes. Fearing the presence of the troops, the victims rounded up sheep and cows and moved them toward a mountainous area behind their homes, he said. When they got cold, they gathered brush and lighted a fire to keep warm, he said. One airstrike hit a large boulder and the other struck the victims, who were badly burned, according to Sanjani.",Apology comes as top commander in Afghanistan condemns Taliban's use of child suicide bombers .

This is the face of a forgotten hero - . the first U.S. air force officer killed in Europe after America's entry . into the Second World War. Fighter pilot Lt Col Townsend . Griffiss was highly regarded by the . military but his name was, until now, virtually lost to history. He was the first of 30,000 American airmen to lose their lives in the bloody conflict - shot down in friendly fire after the plane he travelling in was tragically mistaken for a German aircraft on February 15 1942 on its way from Cairo to the UK. Now, on the 70th anniversary of his death this week, his contribution to the war effort is being remembered in a feature for the BBC's online news magazine. His death at 41 led to improved training for airmen to help them recognise the differences between military and civilian aircraft. He also helped establish a key supply route across Siberia for American lend-lease aircraft. There is no memorial to Lt Col Griffiss in the UK, although the US . Army Air Force named their British headquarters after him, Camp . Griffiss, at the Teddington end of Bushy Park, in west London, which has now been demolished. Another airbase in New York was also named after him. Born in San Diego in California to a . wealthy well-to-do family Lt Col Griffiss was a keen polo player. He trained as a fighter pilot and served in Hawaii in the 1920s. After being posted to bases in California and Texas he worked in Paris and Berlin as an air attache from 1935. Between 1936 and 1938 he excelled in his observations . and analysis of the civil war in Spain. This was seen as a way to test . military technologies and the U.S. government wanted information on how . aircraft and tanks were used and deployed. In September 1940 the U.S. had agreed to . help Britain in the conflict and provide the nation with 50 naval . destroyers in return for the lease of military bases in various . territories. A B-24 Liberator in flight. Griffiss travelled to Tehran and then to Cairo where he boarded an unarmed B-24 Liberator to the UK operated by the British Overseas Airways Corporation . The Liberator, pictured later became one of the most familiar heavy bombers used by U.S. airmen, but at the time of Griffiss's death there were not many around . Following his stint in Spain and another stint in the U.S. he arrived in London at the end of the Blitz, in 1941, becoming a special observer unofficially . preparing for the military alliance with Britain following Pearl . Harbour. His aide was Gen James Chaney. However, in November that year, he . left his post and was sent to Moscow to work with the Soviet government . trying to negotiate the opening of a Siberian supply route for American . lend-lease aircraft. The existing route to Russia from the UK was via the Middle East which took longer. Despite two months of conversations . with Russia, his bid to create the new delivery route failed, but bad . weather meant it was impossible for him to return to Britain straight . away. It was the start of a series of events which led to his death, following which he was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal. He travelled to Tehran and then to Cairo where he boarded an unarmed B-24 Liberator to the UK operated by the British Overseas Airways Corporation.

This type of plane later became one . of the most familiar heavy bombers used by U.S. airmen but at the time . there were not many around. The flight was the first of its kind . and was fraught with delays due to strong winds which meant it would . have run out of fuel on its route across the Bay of Biscay and around . Brittany. The captain eventually suggested a . direct route across occupied Europe at night and it took off on . Valentine's Day even though a message from RAF Transport Command stating . it was against the flight got lost amid conflicting communications.

The plane reached the coast of northern France and registered as hostile on British radar screens. It was shot down by two spitfires from a Polish Air Force squadron based in Exeter who mistook it for a German Focke-Wulf 200 aircraft and everyone on board was killed, including Griffiss, a brigadier of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, a Navy lieutenant and a Rolls Royce employee. Following the tragedy it was realised . that fighter pilots needed more training in recognising the differences . between military and civilian aircraft. It was also a cause of great embarrassment to the Air Ministry and the Air Chief Marshal Charles Portal wrote to Gen Chaney to ease the situation. He was described as an 'outstanding officer' and the citation on his Distinguished Service Medal said he displayed 'rare judgement and devotion to duty' and 'contributed materially to the the successful operation of the . Special Army Observers Group, London'. Months after his death the Soviet authorities changed their mind on the supply route Lt Col Townsend had been trying to set up and in the summer of that year it became the main route for U.S. deliveries to Russia.

In a move that could anger Buenos Aires still further, members of the Defence Select Committee said they would be visiting the islands next month. They want to inspect Britain's military force there, which has recently been joined by the Duke of Cambridge on a six-week tour as a search and rescue pilot. Fury: An Argentinean veteran from the 1982 conflict holds a flag as policemen try to disperse a protest in Buenos Aires yesterday amid rising tensions . Yesterday Sean Penn was condemned as ‘moronic’ after he attacked Britain’s ownership of the Falkland Islands following a meeting with the president of Argentina. The American actor and ex-husband of Madonna, who is known for his Left-wing views, said Britain’s continuing hold on the islands was ‘colonialist, ludicrous and archaic’. Despite having no previous knowledge or connection with the Falklands – which he referred to as ‘the Malvinas Islands of Argentina’ – he called on Britain to relinquish them. The Defence Select Committee visit comes ahead of the 30th anniversary of the conflict over the Falklands, The Times reported. Fury: The Defence Select Committee are planning their visit amid rising tensions. Here a banner in Buenos Aires last week reads 'Brits get out of the Malvinas (Falkland Islands)' 'Given that we have a significant military presence in the Falklands... it is only right that the defence committee goes and sees first-hand what taxpayers' money is being spent on and what it is doing,' committee member Thomas Docherty said. 'One of my priorities given the historic connection this year will be the anniversary. It is important this year that we recognise the sacrifices made.' An Argentine war veterans spokesman described the visit as 'another provocation'. Juan Mendicino, president of the association that represents Falklands veterans, told The Times: 'Argentina does not want war - it wants peace and the return of our islands through diplomatic negotiation. Disputed territory: The Falkland Islands which a group of MPs are planning to visit next month . 'But the only thing that the English think about is war. We don't want visitors from your parliament. 'We want the UN to intervene as it has done in disputes across the world.' There has been months of escalating rhetoric between Britain and Argentina. Most recently, Argentina has said it had intelligence that a Vanguard submarine had been sent to the area and demanded to know whether it was carrying warheads. 'Thus far the UK refuses to say whether it is true or not,' foreign minister Hector Timerman told a press conference. 'Are there nuclear weapons or are there not? The information Argentina has is that there are these nuclear weapons.' Tensions: The Duke of Cambridge has been deployed on a six-week tour as a search and rescue pilot in the Falklands - angering Argentina . Mr Timerman said Britain was using an 'unjustified defence of self-determination' to maintain a military base on the Falklands, which allowed it to dominate the Atlantic. But Britain's ambassador to the UN, Sir Mark Lyall Grant branded the idea that the UK was 'militarising' the situation 'manifestly absurd'. In recent months, Prime Minister David Cameron and President Cristina Kirchner have traded barbs prompting United Nations secretary general Ban Ki-moon to issue a statement expressing 'concern about the increasingly strong exchanges'. Tempers flared after Britain deployed one of its most modern destroyers, HMS Dauntless, to the region, although it insisted the move was merely routine. The Duke of Cambridge's arrival in the Falklands for a posting as an RAF search and rescue pilot has further infuriated Buenos Aires. And there were protests after the website of Falklands newspaper the Penguin News ran a photo of Mrs Kirchner labelled 'bitch'.","Defence Select Committee to visit ahead of 30th anniversary of Falklands War .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:46 PM on 23rd January 2012 . An investigative hearing has recommended that an American soldier be court-martialed over hazing that allegedly led to a fellow infantryman's suicide in Afghanistan, but dismissed the most serious charge against him. Specialist Ryan Offutt is one of eight soldiers charged in the death of 19-year-old Private Danny Chen, who shot himself on October 3 after what investigators say were weeks of physical abuse, humiliation and racial slurs. A native New Yorker of Chinese descent, Mr Chen had been in Afghanistan only two months when he shot himself in a guardhouse at a remote outpost in Afghanistan's Kandahar province. Scroll down for videos . Death: Private Danny Chen, 19, of New York, was found dead in a guard tower at Combat Outpost Palace on October 3 after apparently committing suicide . Criminal: Specialist Ryan Offutt punched and choked his ex-girlfriend, stripping her, in a sadistic beating in 2001 . Mr Chen's family has said investigators told them that he was subjected to numerous racial slurs and forced to do excessive sit-ups, push-ups, runs and sprints carrying sandbags as punishment for not being as physically fit as the rest of the platoon. On the day that he killed himself, he forgot his helmet and water when he went to report to the guardhouse. His superiors forced him to crawl over 100 meters of gravel with all of his equipment when he returned, all the while having other soldiers throw rocks at him. The investigative hearing recommended . that Offutt, 32, be court-martialed on charges including assault, . negligent homicide, and reckless endangerment, a statement from U.S. military said after the hearing ended Sunday. The most serious charge Offutt now faces is negligent homicide, which carries a prison sentence of up to three years. Sadness: A portrait of U.S. Army Private Danny Chen is displayed during his funeral procession in New York on October 13 after his death in Afghanistan . Grieving: The casket of Private Danny Chen is carried by an honour guard during a funeral procession in New York two months ago . Offutt, from Greenville, who measured more than 6ft is thought to have been among the worst of the alleged bullies. The 32-year-old is one of four soldiers facing the most heinous charges . In October 2001 Offutt was charged with aggravated assault and attempted rape, the Daily News reported. His former girlfriend told police he beat her and ripped off her clothes. 'Offutt tried to have intercourse with her,' a criminal complaint alleged. She 'had to fight Offutt to escape.' The soldier's roommates woke up to the noise of the girl screaming, the complaint states. They found her 'naked and bleeding from the face.' Watch: Private Chen was found dead in October in a guard tower in southern Afghanistan's Kandahar province (file picture) In that case, Offutt pleaded guilty . to simple assault and indecent assault and was sentenced to four months . to two years in prison.  He was also obliged to attend drug and alcohol . treatment. Offutt joined the army in 2006 and is  based at Fort Wainright, Alaska. The regional American military commander will make a final decision on any court-martial based on the hearing's recommendations, the U.S. statement said. Attorneys for Offutt could not immediately be contacted. Offutt, a native of Greenville, Pennsylvania, joined the Army in 2006 and served 14 months in Iraq before being deployed to Afghanistan. Seven other members of Mr Chen's unit will face similar hearings to Offutt’s over the next month at Kandahar Air Field, the sprawling base for U.S. and Nato operations in the south. In action: Sergeant Travis F. Carden was one of eight soldiers charged . One of those men- First Lt. Daniel Schwartz, the only officer charged with Chen’s death- also has a record, the Daily News reported. The 25-year-old Maryland man was arrested five years ago for possession of a controlled substance, according to records. The Army has identified the other soldiers charged as Staff Sargent Blaine G. Dugas, 35, of Port Arthur, Texas; Staff Sargent Andrew J. Van Bockel, 26, of Aberdeen, South Dakota; Sargent Adam M. Holcomb, 29, of Youngstown, Ohio; Sargent Jeffrey T. Hurst, 26, of Brooklyn, Iowa; Specialist Thomas P. Curtis, 25, of Hendersonville, Tennessee; and Sargent Travis F. Carden, 24, of Fowler, Indiana. All are members of the 3rd Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment, 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division based out of Fort Wainwright, Alaska.

Anne Thornton's programme with the Food Network was not renewed after production staff discovered some of her recipes were taken from cookbooks and famous chefs like Martha Stewart and the Barefoot Contessa, sources told the New York Post. Thornton, who lives in New York, presented  'Dessert First,' a popular cookery programme which began in October 2010. Axed: Anne Thornton's programme with the Food Network was not renewed after production staff discovered some of her recipes were taken from cookbooks and famous chefs like Martha Stewart . 'The network was very concerned because many of her recipes were close — with only a few minor edits — to other chefs’ recipes,' a source close to the production told the New York Post. The frosting for Thornton’s German Chocolate Cupcakes, was reported to be a close copy to Martha Stewart’s 2009 Coconut-Pecan Frosting. The only differences were a handful of pecans and a chunk of butter. Her Luscious Lemon Squares were also reported to be too similar to a 1999 recipe from Ina Garten, the Barefoot Contessa. Too close for comfort: Thornton's Mascarpone-Stuffed French . Toast (left) was deemed close to a recipe published in 2006 in the cookbook .

Too similar: The frosting for Thornton's German Chocolate Cupcakes, was reported to be a near replica of Martha Stewart's 2009 Coconut-Pecan Frosting, apart from a handful of pecans and a chunk of butter . Thornton's Mascarpone-Stuffed French Toast was deemed close to a recipe published in 2006 in the cookbook 'The Essence of Chocolate.' A recipe comparison showed Thornton added orange zest to the mix and  substituted a topping of strawberry, rather than maple syrup - the wording was also found to be very similar. Thornton was in the middle of her 13-episode second season when the discovery was made, said an insider. Thornton was informed her show would not be renewed in the summer. She worked in finance before her skills caught the attention of the TV bosses at a New York wine and . food fest in 2009. Contacted yesterday by the New York Post, Thornton insisted there was never any issue over the originality of her recipes. 'This is all news to me,' she said. 'I get inspiration from all my heroes,' said Thornton, who counts the Barefoot Contessa among her biggest influences. 'You take what you learn from them and then you riff on that,' she said. 'As for lemon squares, there’s only so many ways you can make them, so of course there will be similarities. A Food Network spokeswoman yesterday declined to address whether there was any issue over the origin of Thornton’s recipes. 'Anne’s . show, ‘Dessert First,’ was not renewed after its second season purely . due to ratings/performance,' she said in a statement.

The best friend of an 11-year-old boy who died when the dirt tunnel they were digging collapsed has described his desperate attempt to save him. Anthony Fowler, from Temecula, California, was crushed by two feet of dirt and rocks while making a tunnel at a park with Tyler Brown, also 11. The youngster screamed to his best friend that he could not breathe. Unable to dig him out, Tyler called 911 but Anthony later died in hospital. Scroll down for video . Tragic: 11-year-old Anthony Fowler, pictured, has died after he was crushed by dirt as he dug a tunnel along a dry riverbed with his best friend . 'I just tried to dig him out and dirt kept falling in so I called 911 and told them my location,' Tyler recounted to CBS Los Angeles. The boys had been digging tunnels into the side of the dry riverbed at Long Canyon Creek Park on Saturday when one of the tunnels collapsed. Tyler had been sitting up at the time, but Anthony was lying down. After the soil fell in, Tyler could only see Anthony's shoe. Two passers-by rushed over and managed to dig the boy out after hearing Tyler's screams. When emergency services pulled the . boy from the soil and administered CPR, he spat out some dirt and then . stopped breathing, Tyler told CBS. Tyler . visited Anthony several times in the San Diego hospital where the . youngster was in an induced coma and had no brain function. Helpless: His best friend Tyler Brown, also 11, was unable to save him . Happy memories: The boys had been friends for four years and lived just one street from each other. They enjoyed riding their bikes and digging at the park . Anthony passed away on Monday, his parents announced on Thursday. They added that the boy's organs had been donated to others. The two boys lived just one street away from each other and had been playing together for four years, the Temecula Patch reported. 'They'd get on their bikes, ride around and have adventures, like boys should,' Tyler's father Chris Brown told the paper. Tyler, . who escaped with scratches, has been branded a 'hero' by his classmates . - but the youngster refuses to accept the accolade. 'I wouldn't say that because usually heroes save lives and I couldn't get [Anthony] out fast enough,' he told CBS. Site: Two feet of rocks and dirt fell on the boys at Long Canyon Creek Park . Panic: Two passers-by helped Tyler pull his friend from the dirt and called 911. Anthony was taken to hospital and put in a coma, but died two days later . He added: 'We’re almost like brothers because we’re always helping each other out and we’re usually at each others’ houses everyday.' Tyler is now seeing a therapist to cope with losing his best friend. On their CaringBridge.org page, Anthony Fowler's parents shared their decision to donate the boy's organs to others. They wrote: 'Early this morning at 4:56 am, his heart stopped and Anthony made the ultimate sacrifice to give so many others a chance to live. 'Today as with every other day, he is our hero. As his parents we are sad but at the same time very proud that our son has given the gift of life to others.'

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 11:04 PM on 16th February 2012 . The stepbrother of a severely malnourished teen found walking barefoot in the cold near her home wearing pyjamas was today charged with repeatedly sexually assaulting her from her 10th birthday. The 18-year-old man allegedly began the assaults on the 15-year-old girl in the same year she claims her father and stepmother began confining her to the basement of her home in Wisconsin. The girl's father, 40, and stepmother, 42, were charged with child abuse, reckless endangerment and neglecting a child. All three accused appeared in a Wisconsin court on Thursday for a hearing. Mugshots: The girl's stepmother, left, and father, right, were both arrested in connection with the case . The stepbrother sexually assaulted . the girl in December 2006, the month she turned 10, and again from . February 2009 to February 2010, prosecutors say. He was charged with . child sexual assault. Robert Burke, defending, said the . parents have strong ties to the community. Bail was set by the court at . $22,500 for the father, $30,000 for the stepmother and $25,000 for the . girl's stepbrother. Meanwhile astonishing details emerged . of how child protection services has dealt with eight reports of . abuse against the malnourished teenage girl found walking the streets . barefoot. It comes as the girl’s neighbours . revealed today that she rarely left her home in Wisconsin - but when she . did emerge, she would scavenge through rubbish bins and eat discarded . scraps. The 15-year-old - allegedly forced to stay in a basement for six years and eat her own faeces - was found walking in Wisconsin last Monday, with purple bare feet and a bleeding face. In only one of the eight reports - . from when the girl was aged just months old in 1997 - maltreatment was . 'substantiated’, according to State Department of Children & . Families records sent to MailOnline. But in three reports, ‘maltreatment . was 'unsubstantiated’ - and three others were ‘screened out’ by officials. Two of those saw health services officials ‘refer the family to a . community service provider’. The eighth report was filed last Monday when the girl was found walking in the streets of Wisconsin. 'A report is screened out if the agency determines that the reported information or allegation does not meet the legal definition of abuse or neglect,' a State Department of Children & Families spokesman told MailOnline. She added that the opposite is when 'a report of alleged maltreatment that meets the legal definition of abuse or neglect has been received by the agency and has been screened in for investigation and assessment of the family'. Neighbour Mark Stuntebeck said he called . child protection in the last two years after he saw her taking . out the rubbish and scavenging through it, but doesn't know if anyone . ever followed up. ‘She seemed to be hiding and munching . on crumbs or remnants of something,’ said Mr Stuntebeck, 44, who lives . next door. But he wasn’t the only neighbour to think there was something . wrong. In court: The girl told police she was let out of the basement to 'clean some papers' for her mother, who became angry because she wasn't doing it fast enough and threatened to throw her down the stairs . Melissa Clark, 38, said the girl . rarely came outside but she could hear her family berating her inside . the house. Ms Clark's mother, who was visiting last year, noticed the . girl and called child protection. She doesn't know if anything was done. The girl’s parents once yelled at her for showing too much skin when . she was bent over and her blouse hung off her, Ms Clark, who lives . across the street, said. Investigation: The stepbrother was also arrested by local police for an alleged probation violation . ‘It was horrible,’ she said. ‘She was . treated like Cinderella.’ A police spokesman said on Wednesday . that the teen, who weighed 70lbs when she was found, was getting medical . treatment and is being held in protective custody. The malnourished girl told authorities . she had been forced to stay in the unfinished basement of her father . and stepmother's home since 2006 and that an alarm would sound if she . went upstairs. She allegedly ate what she could find . in the rubbish and had to eat her own faeces and drink her urine - but . if she was caught eating without permission, she had to throw it out or . vomit it back up. The allegations came to light after . Mike Vega, 31, saw the girl walking in thin pyjamas, barefoot and crying . on a cold afternoon last Monday. ‘It was the most shocking thing I have . ever seen,’ he said. She was bleeding from a gash on her . nose and other small scrapes and was so scrawny Mr Vega mistook her for . an 8-year-old. He called police. ‘I've never seen anybody look like . that,’ he said. A doctor quoted in police reports said . what the girl went through before she was found by Mr Vega - who lives . about a mile from the teen and her family - amounted to ‘torture.’ Shocked: Mike Vega points to the pavement in Wisconsin, where he discovered the 15-year-old girl . Mr Vega was driving on a busy street . when he saw her. As he slowly passed her, he looked through his . rear-view mirror and saw her bare feet. He backed up, and she told him . she needed help. 'It was the most shocking thing I have ever seen. I've never seen anybody look like that' Mike Vega, 31, who found girl on street . Once inside his car, she was scared at . first, but Mr Vega said she became more comfortable after he showed her . photos of his three young sons and a Mary Poppins video on his mobile . phone. According to police records, the girl . claimed she was let out of the basement that day to ‘clean some papers’ for her stepmother, who had become angry because she wasn't working fast . enough. The teen told Mr Vega the stepmother . threw her back downstairs but she managed to escape out a window. Mr . Vega said she told him she feared the woman would throw her down the . stairs again. She said she had threatened to . kill her. Mr Vega said the girl ‘wasn't crying, wasn't hysterical’. ‘But . it wasn't nonchalant either,’ he added. ‘You could see fear in her eyes. It was very disturbing.’ Barbara Knox, a physician quoted in . the police reports, told officers the malnutrition the girl suffered . ‘poses a significant risk of death’ and that chronic starvation had . caused her puberty to be arrested. The physician at the American Family . Children's Hospital in Wisconsin also said that the girl would . be at high risk for other disorders and complications that can lead to . death. 'It was horrible. She was treated like Cinderella' Melissa Clark, 38, neighbour . The teen said her stepmother . home-schooled her using a third-grade workbook, according to the . affidavit. Two other minors in the home were . taken into protective custody, police said. Police did encounter the girl in 2007, . when someone alleged she might have been molested by a relative. The . girl did not corroborate the allegation and her family was not . cooperative, police said. She appeared healthy at the time, . police said. The girl's father allegedly gave medical reasons for her . condition last week - but a hospital social worker told police there was . likely much more to it. Her stepmother has owned the Wisconsin home since 2005 and reportedly bought it from Christian affordable . housing organisation Habitat for Humanity, who performed a background . check of her.","Wisconsin teenager found walking streets barefoot in pyjamas last week .

Promotional trail: Sports Illustrated's new cover girl Kate Upton is making the most of her promotion as she hits another bash in Las Vegas . Kate showed off the immaculate looks which landed her the cover in the first place, showing she looks just as good with her clothes on as she does in a bikini. The 19-year-old wore a figure-hugging black strapless dress with a white hem skimming her cleavage.

"By . Lucy Laing . Last updated at 8:45 AM on 13th February 2012 . When medical treatment fails, a mother’s love and devotion can be just as powerful. When Sandra and Rob Margetts were told by doctors in the UK that they couldn’t save their daughter Laura Wright from a brain tumour they refused to give up hope. Laura, 34, had been struck down by the rare tumour and the operation to try and reduce it caused her to have a massive stroke, and doctors said there was nothing more they could do. Happy family: Laura, centre with her mother Sanda Margetts, right, and her husband Rob with their sons Felix and Ben. Her parents paid £150,000 for pioneering treatment in the USA to save their daughter's life . So the couple paid £150,000 for pioneering treatment in the USA - as a last chance of hope to save their daughter’s life. The treatment was successful, but it left Laura unable to have the family she desperately wanted. So the loving family stepped in once again - and funded the £25,000 cost of seven cycles of IVF treatment to give their daughter the two sons she had dreamed of. Mrs Wright, who lives with her husband Rob, 38, in Liphook, Hampshire, said: ‘I just can’t find the words to thank my mum and dad for what they have done for me. ‘They have never given up on me, and because of them I can have the life I’ve always dreamed of. ‘I’m still alive and I have the two most gorgeous sons. And its all thanks to mum and dad who have made it all happen for me.’ Mrs Wright first started suffering from headaches in the summer of 2001 when she was working as a school PE teacher. She went to see her GP who referred her to the Royal Surrey County Hospital in Guildford who said there was nothing wrong. But she still kept suffering from blurred vision and headaches, so she went for a private MRI scan, which revealed that she had a brain tumour. Mrs Wright said: ‘I was so shocked when I was diagnosed. All I could think of was it shouldn’t be happening, I was only 26. I had my whole life ahead of me. I was so frightened, I thought I was going to die.’ Laura having treatment for her tumour in Boston, USA. Mrs Wright first started suffering from headaches in the summer of 2001 when she was working as a school PE teacher . She underwent an operation at the Atkinson Morley Hospital in London to remove part of the tumour, and then doctors decided to remove the rest of the tumour in a second operation in April 2004. But during the second operation, Mrs Wright suffered a stroke that was so severe that she couldn’t talk and was paralysed down her right side. Because she had suffered the stroke during the operation, the surgeons had been unable to remove the rest of the tumour. It took Mrs Wright five months before she could even get out of her wheelchair and take her first steps being helped by physiotherapists. Doctors told her there was nothing more they could do for her, as they couldn’t risk operating on her again. But her parents refused to give up. They spent hours on the internet and eventually found Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, USA, where doctors had found a way of shrinking tumours by bombarding them with radioactive proton particles. The pioneering treatment would cost £150,000, but it could have left Mrs Wright infertile. Her parents sent her brain scans off to the clinic and they agreed to help. She said: ‘I had always wanted a family so I didn’t want to be left infertile, but I knew this was the only chance to save me, and mum and dad never hesitated to step in and help.’ She went to the USA in January 2005 and underwent the treatment which took eight weeks. It finished in March that year, and the treatment had managed to successfully halt the growth of the tumour. Mrs Wright said: ‘I was just so relieved when the treatment was a success. It had given me my life back. It was my only chance of survival, and now I could look forward to living my life again.’ The treatment had left Mrs Wright infertile, but again her family refused to give up hope as they knew how desperately their daughter wanted to be a mother. Mrs Wright said: ‘I had always desperately wanted to have a family. I was so thrilled that I was still alive after the brain tumour and I was so grateful for that. But every time I saw a pregnant woman I just felt a huge longing to be a mum myself.’ The family funded the first IVF treatment for their daughter, and the first cycle was a success. She fell pregnant with their son Felix, now four. Mrs Wright said: ‘When I gave birth to him I stared at him for hours because I couldn’t believe that he was actually mine. After everything that had happened I was finally a mum.’ The couple decided to try for another baby, but this time it took six attempts at fertility treatment before Mrs Wright finally fell pregnant again. She gave birth to her second son Ben in August 2010. She said: ‘We didn’t give up hope, and my family were behind us, supporting us all the way. When I fell pregnant again, we were all so thrilled. When Ben was born, it was as though my life was complete. ‘The doctors may have given up on me but my family never did, and its thanks to them that I’m still alive.

Gabe Watson, 34, wrapped his arms around his wife Tina Watson moments . before she sank to the ocean's bottom in 2003, said Dr Stanley Stutz, an . emergency room physician from Chicago, Illinois. But prosecutors contend Dr Stutz witnessed the woman's murder on the . Great Barrier Reef - and another witness on the trip said he never . believed the husband's story about what happened.

Hearing: Gabe Watson talks with his lawyer Michael Hanle, left, and Watson looks at his phone during the lunch break while his new wife Kim stands behind him, right, on Thursday at court in Birmingham, Alabama . Dr Stutz said he was in the water with about three dozen other divers . when he looked down and saw Mrs Watson floating on her back with her . arms extended, moving slowly in the water. ‘I was close enough to see her face,’ Dr Stutz told the court in . Birmingham, Alabama, adding that Mrs Watson seemed distressed but wasn't . thrashing and moved like she ‘had no energy’. Jurors listened intently on Thursday while Dr Stutz testified. Their . perceptions of his story could be vital to the outcome of Watson's . capital murder trial at the Mel Bailey Criminal Justice Center.

They contend Dr Stutz saw Watson during the final scene of a murderous . act - but yet he told the court he didn't think anything sinister had . happened at first. Under cross examination, he said he believed Watson was attempting to . help the woman. ‘I thought Gabe was trying to save her,’ he said. ‘I was . surprised when I got an email that it was a murder trial.’ Testimony: Diving expert Kenneth Snyder speaks at the Gabe Watson trial in Alabama on Thursday . Evidence showed Watson was certified as a rescue diver in 1999, about . four years before his wife drowned in October 2003. She was a novice . diver, the court heard. 'I asked Gabe where Tina was at. He said: ""She didn't come up""' Kenneth Snyder, master diver . Her scuba gear sat in a pile on a table at the front of the courtroom . during testimony, just a few feet from Watson at the defence table. He . has since remarried and has been at court this week with his second wife, Kim Lewis. The defence claims Mrs Watson panicked during the dive and knocked off . her husband's mask and air supply, forcing him to surface for help . because the current had carried her away from him. A master diver on the trip, Kenneth Snyder of Estero, Florida, said he . and his wife talked with a bubbly Mrs Watson and her husband on their . boat, the Spoilsport, before divers went in the water.

Mr Snyder added that he soon saw Mrs Watson's body being taken out of . the water and placed on the deck of another boat, Jazz II, which was . about 100ft away. Watson didn't try to get to the Jazz II while others were trying to revive his wife, Mr Snyder said. Mr Snyder added that he asked Watson what had happened underwater and . immediately disbelieved the man's claim that his wife had panicked and . knocked off his gear. Mr Snyder said he told Watson: ‘That's bulls**t. That didn't happen.’ Mr Snyder said a friend told Watson the same thing.

Gabe Watson says his wife Tina Watson died as the result of a terrible diving accident . Earlier, Mr Snyder said a rescuer only must press a single button on a . distressed diver's gear to fill a bladder with air and send the other . person to the surface. ‘It will save their life?’ asked prosecutor Don Valeska. ‘Absolutely,’ replied Mr Snyder. Prosecutors argue that Watson killed the woman hoping to collect some . $210,000 in insurance benefits and her diamond engagement ring, but the . defence maintains her death was an accident.

A co-founder of Pinkberry Frozen Yogurt accused of beating up a homeless man with a tyre iron because he disliked his sexually-explicit tattoo also owns illegal guns, according to police. Young Lee, 47, was arrested at Los Angeles airport last month and was charged with assault with a deadly weapon. The alleged incident last June left the victim with a broken arm and cuts to the head. Police then searched his Los Angeles home and fleet of luxury cars and found two handguns, a Colt .45 and a Para Ordnance Brand .45. Legal problems: Pinkberry co-founder Young Lee, pictured with his attorney Philip Kent Cohen at a court hearing in Los Angeles last month, had illegal guns in his home, police claim. He is accused of beating up a homeless man with a tyre iron . It is unclear whether the firearms were found in Lee's house or high-end vehicles including a 2009 Rolls-Royce Phantom, 2007 Ferrari 599 GTB and a 2010 Mercedes G Wagon. A police search warrant affidavit obtained by TMZ.com states that, due to a 2001 conviction for drugs possession, Lee is not allowed to 'own, buy, receive, possess, or have custody or control of any firearms'. He also has a conviction for possession of a firearm and could now face this same charge again. Lee is accused of assaulting the unnamed homeless man on the off-ramp of a motorway last June. He saw a tattoo - of a man and woman having sex - when the transient was changing his sweater and became so angry, he got out of his car and approached him, it is claimed. Lee's attorney claims his client was threatened by the man and thought he had a weapon. Craze: Lee co-founded Pinkberry with partner Shelly Hwang. They opened their first shop in Hollywood in 2005, immediately gaining a celebrity following . But . police believe it was the Korean-born entrepreneur who first approached . him after seeing what he deemed a disrespectful tattoo. They . believe that Lee drove over to the man, rolled down his window and . started arguing with him, before getting out to confront him. Officials . say Lee demanded that the man kneel on the ground and apologise and . even though he consented, he still attacked him with the tyre iron. The homeless man was beaten so brutally he had to be hospitalised. Former kickboxer Lee paints a very different picture, however. His . attorney Philip Kent Cohen last month told the Los Angeles Times that . 'the transient made explicit threats as if he had a weapon, which he may . have had. 'As the evidence comes out, the reality will be much different than has been presented. 'All of the people in the car felt at risk and felt threatened.' Hugely successful: The Korean-born entrepreneur already has a conviction for possession of a firearm . Lee . - who co-founded the healthy, low-calorie dessert chain - was arrested . after a witness called police and gave the license plate number of the . Range Rover involved, which was rented in Lee's name. Investigators later recovered the tyre iron through the rental car agency. Witnesses picked Lee from police photos and authorities obtained the warrant while the 47-year-old was traveling overseas. According . to police, a federal database alerted Los Angeles detectives that Lee . was aboard an inbound flight from Korea to Los Angeles Airport last . month, when he was arrested. Lee is currently free on $60,000 bail. Lee, a kick-boxer-turned-architect-turned-entrepreneur, co-founded Pinkberry with partner Shelly Hwang, CBS Los Angeles reports.

A senior Chamber of Commerce figure and former RAF police officer raped a schoolgirl while his wife lay on the bed watching, a court heard today. Derek Chartres, 59, allegedly watched pornography and engaged in sex acts in front of schoolgirls and is also accused of raping a girl under 16. The former Chamber of Commerce president is accused of a string of sex acts against two girls, while his wife Pearl, 51, denies aiding and abetting the rape after she allegedly lay on the bed and watched. The alleged offences took place . between 1982 and 1984 when Chartres, from Newport, Isle of Wight, . committed the offences on the two schoolgirls, who are now both women in . their 40s, telling one it was 'sex education'. One . of the women complained to police in 2010 that Mr Chartres raped her . when she was a schoolgirl in the couple's bedroom, while his wife lay on . the bed and watched. One . girl, who recalled being around 11 at the time, told police how Mr . Chartres would watch pornographic videos in her presence and had once . kissed her intimately. She . said Mr and Mrs Chartres asked if she liked sex and engaged in sex acts . in front of her. They once had full sex in front of her calling it 'sex . education', according to prosecutor Roderick Blain. She said she also remembered Mr Chartres kissing her, which she found 'disgusting'. In . a DVD interview conducted by police, played to jurors, the other alleged victim . said Mr Chartres watched pornographic videos and rubbed her leg. On another occasion Mr and Mrs Chartres had full sex in front of her in the couple’s bedroom, she claimed. 'Sex attack': Derek Chartres allegedly raped a . schoolgirl while his wife Pearl is said to have lay on the couple's bed . and watched . She said: 'I could not believe what I was seeing.' Under cross examination from Mr Chartres’s barrister, Robert Bryan, she agreed she could not be sure how old she was when the alleged offences took place. Mr Bryan put it to the woman that she had 'made everything up'. However, she told the court everything she had said about the couple was the 'absolute truth'. Mr Chartres, managing director of business logistics and support company The Business Services Group and a former officer in the Royal Air Force police, helped found a youth version of the Chamber of Commerce called Young Chamber. He faces one charge of committing indecent assault, one of committing gross indecency with a child under the age of 14 and one of raping another girl under 16. His wife, on trial alongside her husband this week, is accused of aiding and abetting a rape and indecent assault.

Last month Gelman was sentenced to the maximum sentence for each of 13 counts; some of the sentences will run consecutively, resulting in the 200-year term. 'You are a violent predator and sociopath,' Judge Vincent Del Giudice said at the sentencing. Gelman's deadly spree on February 11 started with a family argument over whether he could use his mother's car. He stabbed his stepfather to death in their Brooklyn home, then took off in the car and drove to the home of an acquaintance, Yelena Bulchenko. Bulchenko's friends have said he was obsessed with the 20-year-old woman and imagined a romantic relationship with her. She wasn't home, but Gelman stabbed her 56-year-old mother to death, then waited nearly nine hours with the body for the daughter to return. When she walked in, he stabbed her 11 times, killing her, authorities said. During his January trial Gelman interrupted Bulchenko's boyfriend, Gerard Honig, telling him he had fallen in love 'with a heroin addict,' to which Honig responded, 'You can burn in hell.' Gelman was then removed from the courtroom for a short time. After stabbing Bulchenko, Gelman left the home, rear-ended a car and wildly stabbed at the driver, authorities said. The driver survived. Stealing the wounded man's car, Gelman drove off and ploughed into 62-year-old Stephen Tanenbaum, who died from his injuries. After abandoning the car, he later hailed a livery cab and attacked its driver, then approached another car, attacked a man inside and seized the car, police said. Both men survived. All those attacks happened in Brooklyn. As authorities hunted him, Gelman was next spotted hours later on a subway train in Manhattan, where passengers recognised him from newspaper photographs and notified police. When asked by police why the four victims had to die, Gelman said, 'Because I said so,' according to the documents.","Maksim Gelman smiled as 25 years was added to his current 200 year jail sentence for four murders in February 2011 .

Trip: Hours before the flight drama, The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had been pictured in Copenhagen on their first joint humanitarian mission . Passengers on the on 162-seat airliner back to Britain all escaped the episode unhurt, but The Duchess of Cambridge was said to have been 'deeply unsettled' by the incident. Prince Willam and Kate Middleton were returning from a joint trip to the Danish capital on their first humanitarian mission. A source close to the incident told The People: 'This really was a serious incident and would have been terrifying for those on board.

"By . Becky Barrow, Business Correspondent and Emma Reynolds . Last updated at 10:15 AM on 17th February 2012 . Fuel bills are set to be slashed after energy watchdog Ofgem told Britain's six biggest suppliers to overhaul their tariffs or face a mandatory cap. The watchdog said it wanted to see 'downward pressure' on prices from the 'Big Six' EDF, E.on, British Gas, Southern, Scottish Power and npower after concerns customers are being ripped off. Bills have doubled to £1,250 a year since 2002, with 5.5million households facing fuel poverty, in which they spend 10 per cent or more of their income on power. Squeezed: Millions of families are struggling to afford their utility bills, with many choosing between heating and eating (file picture) Now Ofgem have ordered energy firms to make changes to confusing and expensive tariffs or endure tougher sanctions, which could include the first price controls in ten years, according to The Independent. But the savings could come a little too late for families already choosing between heating and eating. The watchdog said: 'Parliament has given us the task of trying to create an effective market where competition is the downward pressure on prices. 'We think that's the way to go, although we haven't ruled out regulation, particularly for more vulnerable customers, if our reforms don't work.' This could also involve an inquiry by the Competition Commission, which could break up the dominance of the Big Six firms, who control 99 per cent of the market. The news comes after EDF provoked outrage yesterday by revealing a huge surge in profits at a time when families are struggling to pay bills. EDF said its operating profits rose by 8.5 per cent last year to almost £1.6billion. This is the equivalent of £427 for each of the 3.7m UK households to which the French-owned company supplies gas and electricity. Cashing in: EDF has announced a huge profit despite lower sales . The rise came despite the ‘Big Six’ firm’s overall revenues falling by 8 per cent – as it sold less energy due to the milder winter. Experts said the company was able to boost its profit margins because falling wholesale energy prices were not passed on in full to customers. Consumer groups criticised the profits bonanza at EDF at a time when millions of families struggle to afford their energy bills. Audrey Gallacher, director of energy at Consumer Focus, said: ‘EDF Energy’s UK profits have risen despite lower energy use in the milder winter. ‘This will leave many customers wondering whether energy prices can, and should, be cut further. ‘We need successful, profitable companies. But consumers need to know that big profit margins are not being made needlessly at their expense. ‘The issue is not how much money is made over one year. It is whether the market is working as a whole, pricing is fair, and if suppliers are providing enough transparency.’ The company’s statement yesterday said there had been ‘lower gas volumes sold to residential customers due to particularly mild weather’. As a result, its sales dropped by 8 per cent to £7.1billion in 2011 – but this did not stop its operating profits rising by 8.5 per cent to £1.58billion. Mind the gap: The price charged by the Big Six has risen despite a fall in wholesale gas prices . EDF Energy was the first of the ‘Big Six’ to announce a price cut in January, reducing gas prices by 5 per cent and triggering a domino effect among competitors. But wholesale costs had fallen by 9 per cent. And the cut followed two price rises last year. The larger was in November when electricity prices rose by 4.5 per cent and gas by 15.4 per cent. EDF's announcement of its financial results comes days before Centrica, owner of British Gas, will publish its results. In 2010, profits at British Gas . reached an all-time high of £742million and the figures for last year . are expected be around £550m, a 25 per cent fall. Ofgem, blasted the ‘Big Six’ as ‘greedy’, ‘bad’ and ‘lazy’ in a damning report published last March. The industry was found guilty of manipulating prices by putting up tariffs quickly when wholesale prices rise, but delaying passing on reductions. Yesterday consumer group Which? said there was ‘an unstoppable tide of public opinion’ demanding more affordable energy. Hot story: British Gas is also expected to announce hefty profits of around £550m . Ofgem’s figures showed how the . industry’s average ‘dual fuel’ bill for both electricity and gas was . only £885 in 2008. EDF Energy’s current average was £1,129, it said. Richard Lloyd, executive director of . Which?, said: ‘When people see energy suppliers announcing increased . profits despite a mild winter, they’re bound to question whether they’re . paying a fair price. ‘Millions of people are struggling with the cost of living.’ EDF Energy said: ‘We have a strong . track record for consistently delivering some of the most competitive . standard energy prices on the market – and crucially offering these . during the times of year when people use the most energy. ‘In 2010, one of the coldest winters . in living memory, we froze our prices. Last year, we were the last of . the major suppliers to raise our prices and did so by the lowest . amount.’ In a recent interview with this . newspaper, EDF chief executive Vincent de Rivaz said he was doing . everything he could to restore ‘trust’ between his company and its . customers.

David Cameron took a dramatic gamble with the future of the union yesterday by offering to hand more powers to Scotland after a referendum on independence – and got nothing in return. The Prime Minister said the Scots could have further devolution if they vote No to a breakaway. His surprise concession angered Tory MPs who insisted that Nationalist leader Alex Salmond should get no further powers without a referendum in England, Wales and Northern Ireland too. Mr Cameron met Mr Salmond in Edinburgh and emerged ‘frustrated’ after the First Minister refused to budge an inch on his plans for a referendum. Mr Cameron met Mr Salmond in Edinburgh and emerged 'frustrated' after the First Minister refused to budge an inch on his plans for a referendum . The SNP leader was last night still insisting that the Scottish people must be given the chance to vote not just on independence but also for beefed-up powers dubbed ‘devo max’. The Prime Minister sought to undercut that position by offering Scotland sweeping new powers during an impassioned speech in which he said he was ‘ready to fight for the life of this country’. He said: ‘When the referendum on independence is over, I am open to looking at how the devolved settlement can be improved further. ‘And, yes, that does mean considering what further powers could be devolved. But that must be a question for after the referendum, when Scotland has made its choice about the fundamental question of independence or for the United Kingdom.’ Oat so Scottish: David Cameron sits down to a bowl of porridge and some shortbread on a visit to the Quaker Oats factory in Fife . Mr Cameron refused to spell out exactly what he had in mind but Whitehall sources said he is thinking about handing the Scottish government greater control of tax and spending in areas such as welfare policies, to add to its control of health, personal care and university tuition fees. No 10 officials insisted they were not preparing to hand Mr Salmond full ‘devo max’, which would give the First Minister control of everything except defence and foreign affairs. But if Mr Cameron had hoped the bold gambit would help win concessions from Mr Salmond, he was quickly rebuffed. After the talks Mr Cameron said: ‘I am afraid there wasn’t much progress.’ One aide said: ‘He found it frustrating.’ Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond greets David Cameron as he arrives for talks at St Andrews House in Edinburgh yesterday . Last night Mr Salmond accused the Prime Minister of attempting to ‘hijack’ the public consultation on a referendum under way in Scotland by making vague offers. What powers does Scotland have now? Under devolution, the Scottish Government already has wide-ranging powers to set laws on domestic issues from education, to health and prisons. For example, the Scottish people enjoy free tuition fees and free personal care for the elderly. The Scotland Bill, currently going through Parliament, will give £12billion of extra powers allowing Scotland to control even more of its budget. Decisions, mainly concerning matters which have an impact on the United Kingdom as a whole, or indeed on an international basis, such as taxation, foreign affairs and defence, are reserved and dealt with at Westminster. What extra powers could David Cameron give Scotland? SNP leader Alex Salmond is pushing for the Scottish people to be allowed a vote on a so-called ‘devo max’ option which would hand greater powers to Scotland. Devo max has never been fully explained, but is described by the Scottish Government as ‘control of all laws, taxes and duties’ within the UK. Holyrood would be able to raise and spend its own cash, while defence, foreign affairs and monetary policy would remain reserved to Westminster. What would full independence mean? Scotland would become an entirely independent country with control over its own fiscal, defence and foreign policy. The First Minister said: ‘Give us the detail, where’s the beef, what is the proposal, what is on the table? ‘He . can’t seriously expect the people of Scotland to go into this huge . debate, the biggest debate for 300 years about the future of our . country, and have people say, “Look, we’re thinking about giving you . something else; we’re not telling you what it is”. That’s not a tenable . position.’ Privately some Tories warned that Mr Cameron was in danger of ‘giving away the farm’ to the SNP before the referendum campaign has even begun. They believe Mr Salmond does not really want independence but is just keen to secure control of the levers of power – with Scotland’s economy propped up by the Bank of England and English taxpayers. Mr Cameron’s critics will be emboldened by a House of Lords Constitution Committee report published today which makes clear that ‘devo max’ would have to be subjected to a UK-wide referendum. Former Cabinet minister Lord Forsyth said: ‘Devo max would mean creating an English Parliament and a federal government. ‘If . the Prime Minister is saying that Scotland could get more powers, . that’s certainly not something the Government should do without . consulting the people in England.’ Tory . MP Philip Davies voiced the fears of many Tories that handing further . powers to Scotland would leave English voters with an even worse deal. He said: ‘The Scots would still get our money, they’d get all of the . benefits of independence with none of the costs. To me, that’s totally . unacceptable.’ Mr Cameron . admitted that as a wealthy Englishman he might not be the best person to . defeat the call for independence, and urged Labour heavyweights Gordon . Brown, Alistair Darling and John Reid to make the case for the union. He . said: ‘As for the fact that I am English, that I had a privileged . upbringing, that I might annoy people by making a speech in Scotland, . all I can say is that this is what I believe. I care about our United . Kingdom. ‘I am a unionist . head, heart and soul. I believe that England, Scotland, Wales and . Northern Ireland are stronger together than they would ever be apart.’ In his speech, the PM said Scotland had been a 'pioneering country all its life' but the United Kingdom provided a 'stable home that billions envy'","PM said Scots could have further devolution if they vote No to a breakaway .

"By . Jason Groves . Last updated at 10:24 AM on 17th February 2012 . David Bott: Pay has soared from £140,000 in 2007 to £235,000 last year . One of Britain’s highest-paid quango bosses receives his £235,000 a year salary via a private company, it emerged yesterday. David Bott, an ‘innovation director’ at the Technology Strategy Board, is the latest public sector official revealed to be exploiting a loophole that could save him thousands of pounds a year in tax. The obscure quango, which was set up in 2007 to promote innovation in business, has paid him more than £1million in this way over the past five years. The news comes amid mounting controversy over so-called ‘tax dodging’ in the public sector. At least 25 senior staff at the Department of Health receive their pay via private companies, which are often registered at their home addresses. Astonishingly, the head of a union for top civil servants has claimed that the controversial pay deals show that officials’ salaries are too low. Jonathan Baume, general secretary of the First Division Association, said the previous Labour government had tried to recruit senior figures from the private sector without matching their wages. He said: ‘What we have found is that in certain cases, because the market rate was so much greater than the salary that would have been offered in the civil service, various deals were being done, and some of these are now being exposed. From yesterday's Daily Mail . ‘We now need to be very transparent, very clear that this cannot continue, but at the same time grasp the very difficult political nettle, which is to address pay at the senior levels of the civil service. Frankly it’s a shambles – ministers are going to have to raise the salaries.’ The Technology Strategy Board refused to comment on the details of Mr Bott’s remuneration pending a review by the Treasury. The quango’s accounts show that Mr Bott is employed as a contractor, meaning his tax and National Insurance contributions are not deducted at source. They also show that his pay has risen sharply, from £140,000 in 2007 to £235,000 last year. The revelation is a major embarrassment for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, which sponsors the organisation. A source at the department blamed the previous government for agreeing to Mr Bott’s employment status. They said he would be required to go on the quango’s payroll, with tax deducted at source, when his contract comes up for review in July. ‘This is a type of arrangement that we do not want to see continuing in the public sector,’ they added. Emma Boon of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Taxpayers will be angry to see someone who receives such an enormous pay cheque from a taxpayer-funded body using a mechanism that could afford him significant tax advantages. It’s a ridiculous situation if even some people who are employed by the Government, directly or at arm’s length, aren’t paying the right taxes.’ Probe: Danny Alexander has ordered an urgent review into civil servants exploiting the tax loophole . Danny Alexander, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, ordered an urgent review into the pay practice two weeks ago after it emerged that the head of the Student Loans Company, Ed Lester, used a similar arrangement to cut the tax bill on his £182,000 salary. Mr Lester was placed on the organisation’s payroll following public outcry. Last December, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Department of Health told shadow Cabinet Office minister Gareth Thomas that they did not employ any civil servants via private companies. However, leaked emails from the Department of Health suggest that officials may have deliberately misled Parliament to avoid ‘reputational’ damage and any resulting tax investigations. Mr Thomas said he was writing to all government departments to demand a clear statement on the situation – but Labour’s efforts to make political capital out of the situation were undermined as it emerged that shadow health secretary Andy Burnham employs his own chief of staff using the same technique. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles yesterday introduced rules requiring local councils to publish full details of the pay deals of senior executives. They will also be required to review pay arrangements that ‘could be perceived as seeking to minimise tax payments’. Mr Pickles said: ‘Local people have a right to know whether any town hall tax-dodgers are short-changing the public purse.’","David Bott paid £1m via a private company since 2007 .

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 3:49 AM on 17th February 2012 . An author of legal thrillers and a fantasy trilogy who was charged with scamming two women he met on a Jewish dating site out of millions of dollars is planning to plead guilty to some charges. Author Mitchell Gross' attorney Jerry Froelich declined to say which charges his client would plead to at a federal court hearing on Tuesday. The wire fraud and money laundering charges he faces could carry a maximum prison sentence of decades behind bars. Thriller writer Mitchell Gross, here in a publicity photo and his mugshot, allegedly convinced girlfriends he met online to invest millions in a sham company that led directly to his bank account and callously stopped calling them  once he had their money . Gross, whose books include the . suspense story ‘Circle of Lies,’ was charged in October with duping . least two women into investing about $4.4million in a sham company he . set up, using some of the money to buy expensive artwork, a luxury car . and a golf club membership. The 61-year-old author pleaded not guilty to the charges at a court hearing in October. Authorities said Gross began a . romantic relationship with a woman identified in court documents as . ‘R.J.,’ but identified in court as Robbie Johnson. They met through an online Jewish . dating site around June 2006 and he bragged about making a lot of money . by investing with a broker named ‘Michael Johnson’ who was employed by . ‘The Merrill Company,’ the records show. Ms Johnson called the fictional broker . to talk over the investments, but it was actually Gross speaking in a . disguised voice on the other line, prosecutors said. She then wired close to $3million to . an account she believed belong to the company but actually did not . exist, prosecutors said. News to them! Gross bragged that film versions of his books would star Kirsten Dunst and Pierce Brosnan . Gross concealed the scheme by sending her phony tax forms and account statements, they added. Then, investigators said they discovered he was using the woman's funds to repay an ex-girlfriend, identified as ‘J.S.’ Gross also falsely claimed to the girlfriends that Steven Spielberg had optioned his books to make films . She was earlier duped into investing at least $1.4million with the phony firm, prosecutors said. Ms Johnson, a Florida real estate . agent, claimed in a March 2008 lawsuit against Gross that soon after . meeting her online, he falsely told her that celebrities had optioned . his books and that he had fallen in love with her. They took vacations together to Japan, Panama and Brazil, and she hosted a ‘Meet Mitch’ party to introduce him to her friends. But after he got the money — about . $2.95million — he started making excuses to avoid spending time with . her, and delayed moving in together, the lawsuit said. The relationship ended in March 2008, when she discovered the account she was pumping money into was set up under Gross' name. Gross, who lives in Atlanta, Georgia, . has written six books under the Mitchell Graham pen name, including a . three-part science fiction series and a legal thriller called ‘Dead . Docket.’ Court records also say he wrote ‘Circle of Lies’ under the pen name Douglas Alan.","Mitchell Gross has published six books and falsely claimed to his victims that they had been optioned by Steven Spielberg .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:19 AM on 17th February 2012 . A scanner darkly: The machines are being turned off at British airports . Eye scanners which are meant to slash queues at airport passport control are coming under scrutiny after airports around the world started to scrap the costly machines. In the UK, the scheme was introduced at a cost of $14billion but is now quietly being rolled back after officials concluded that the machines were slower than checking passports manually. Now the U.S. airports which have used the technology will have to reconsider their reliance on expensive electronics over human expertise. The last British government claimed that the iris scanners were capable of processing travellers in as little as 12 seconds. But after 385,000 passengers submitted their details, the scanners have been ditched at Birmingham and Manchester airports, and they are expected to vanish from Heathrow and Gatwick after the Olympics. Some irate travellers even ended up getting trapped inside the scanning booths when they malfunctioned. When the then immigration minister, Des Browne, unveiled the Iris Recognition Immigration System, known as Iris, in 2004, he claimed it would provide a ‘watertight’ check of identities as well as cutting queues. It was targeted at foreign passport holders resident in the UK or who regularly travel here and wanted to avoid lengthy queues. They had to undergo a free 15-minute registration to record the unique pattern of their iris every two years. Plans to use the technology for UK passports and even an ill-fated ID cards scheme were dropped after it emerged that up to one in ten travellers was wrongly rejected by the scanners. Scanner inspection: British Home Secretary Charles Clarke tries out one of the new scanners in 2005 as they were hailed by Ministers as a key weapon in the fight against terrorism and fraud . Trumpeted as a key tool in the fight against identity fraud, Iris scanners were expected to slash clues when they were launched by the British Government in 2004. But in reality the scanners were dead on arrival. The scheme cost $14million. Immigration minister Des Browne boasted at launch that the scanners would cut waiting times to just 12 seconds per passenger. The devices, which are free to use, were aimed at regular travellers. But perversely, passengers who want to dodge queues by using the scanners have to queue up for a 15-minute registration - then repeat the process every two years. With the registration scheme now closed, biometric scanners will be phased out within two years unless it it reopened. They then had to wait for manual checks to be performed. Subsequently, facial recognition . technology has been developed with the new generation of biometric . passports which can be used at automated ‘e-gates’. These chip-enabled passports are not . held by travellers from outside the European Economic Area, however, and . they have remained dependent on iris recognition. Lucy Moreton, deputy general . secretary of the Immigration Service Union, said the Iris scheme had . been beset with problems from the beginning. She added: ‘Iris scanners . are prone to throwing up false alerts when genuine travellers try to use . them. We welcome the decision to phase them out.’ James Baker, of privacy group No2ID, . said: ‘This is recognition that iris scanning is an expensive failure. The money would be better spent employing more trained staff to use . their initiative and check passports manually.’ A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We are . phasing out Iris and will be replacing it with other types of gates . that non-EU passengers will be able to use.’",Airports in UK have concluded machines are worse than traditional methods .

Mother-of-three Amanda Osborne-Taylor . told how she has . been put off breeding the pint-sized animals when nine six-week-olds, . worth around £700 each, were taken after she had advertised them for . sale. The 39-year-old cabin crew member now only . keeps three female pigs and has no plans to breed them as the family try to put . the theft behind them. 'It was just horrible telling my . youngest, Gracie, who was just four at the time and had named most of them - . she was devastated. Victim: Amanda Osborne-Taylor, 39, at her home in Capel near Dorking, Surrey, with three other micro-pigs. Sam Edwards has been jailed for 28 months after selling some of the animals after they were stolen . 'She had called them after all her . favourite Disney characters.' Her comments came as a teenager was today jailed for selling some of the pigs days after they were stolen. Sam Edwards, 18, who admitted handling stolen goods, was jailed for 28 months. Today, she told how she is . still mystified that nobody heard the raid on the small barn just yards from . the family home where her pilot husband Jon and children were . sleeping. 'I would, to this day, love to know . how they did it [steal the piglets],' she said. 'They can run really fast . especially when they are scared and they squeal extremely loudly - yet nobody . heard a thing. Stolen: Two of the nine pigs that were taken. The breed has become fashionable for those wanting an unusual pet . 'My husband and the kids were in the . house and they didn't hear anything and neither did the neighbours. 'What annoys me most is that it must . have been pre-planned and they knew exactly what they were doing that night. 'It is just a horrible thought that . they were so close to my home.' Amanda received a call from a young woman . the day before the theft in March last year inquiring about buying a micro-pig . and invited the caller to come and visit. 'There were five of them and they . were all quite young,' she said. 'A couple of them hardly said a word . the whole time they were here and one of the boys did the majority of the . talking. 'Maybe I was a little naive in . hindsight but I never thought that anybody would steal nine piglets inside a . stable. 'When they were taken I knew that it . had to be somebody who knew that we had them here and had seen them, you . wouldn't have just stumbled across them.' Amanda told how the group left saying they . really loved one piglet in particular - the only all pink one of the litter - . and promised to return. It was only after completing the school . run the following day that she realised something was very wrong. 'The stable was all open,' she . said recalling the horror. 'I just couldn't believe what I was . seeing and then I realised that somebody had stolen the piglets and taken them . in the cage we had used to vaccinate them just the day before. 'When I walked into the door, some of . the adult pigs came up to greet me and they were in a terrible state. 'A few of them already had been sold . and were due to be going to new homes at petting farms, it was just awful. 'One or two of the prettier pigs, if . there is such a thing, we had planned to keep for ourselves. Gracie had really . fallen in love with two spotty ones. Breeder: Micro-piglets bred by Amanda Osborne-Taylor were stolen from her home near Dorking, in Surrey, and found their way into the hands of Sam Edwards . 'It completely put us off any future . breeding which is a real shame. 'It wasn't a business, just more of a . hobby. The micro pigs were the children's pets and this was the first litter. It . should have been an exciting time but it was ruined.' Within days of the theft, Edwards’ neighbours called the police after they saw him selling piglets from a shed at the bottom of his garden in Shepperton, Surrey. By the time officers got there, he had sold all but two of the pint-sized animals. The 18-year-old told police he had bought the pair 'from a traveller called John for between £250 and £300 each. Detectives have never tracked down the remaining seven - four black piglets, two pink and black spotted piglets, and a pink one. Edwards was sentenced for three further unrelated offences of aggravated vehicle taking, criminal damage and burglary. Micro-pigs have become sought-after pets after it was revealed that celebrities such as the Beckhams and Paris Hilton have them. One also features on hit TV docu-soap The Only Way is Essex. Micro-pigs have become sought-after pets after it was revealed that celebrities such as the Beckhams and Paris Hilton have them . Ms Osborne-Taylor had been breeding the micro-piglets for two years from her home when the animals were taken overnight between March 27 and 28 last year, the court heard. Gill Beale, prosecuting, told Guildford Crown Court how a group of people had phoned and visited the mother-of-three with a view to buying one of the piglets just the day before. The group were described as being underprepared and were not aware of the required documentation needed to keep a piglet. Mrs Beale said: 'Neighbours living next door to the defendant called police on March 30 after noticing that Mr Edwards was selling pigs from the shed of his home. 'Lots of people were seen coming and going carrying pigs of various colours. 'When police went to his property, two stolen pigs were found there in his shed at the rear of the garden. 'He was arrested and interviewed and asked how he came by the pigs. 'He . said to officers that he brought them legitimately from a travellers’ site and paid between £250 and £300 each for the two pigs. 'He agreed that he was aware that they were advertised on the internet for up to £700.' Edwards told police that he had brought the two pigs off a traveller called John and they were a present for his girlfriend. He denied all knowledge of the theft. 'My three children were devastated when the piglets were stolen,' said the 39-year-old Mrs Osborne-Taylor at the time. 'Breeding micro-piglets is a hobby for all the family, they are our pets and grow up with the children. 'After two of the piglets had been found by Surrey Police, my four-year-old daughter read a story to them and they fell asleep in the cage.' At an earlier hearing at Guildford Crown Court, Edwards had admitted handling stolen goods in relation to the piglets. Peter Marshall, defending, handed the judge a handwritten note from the defendant, in which he admitted remorse for his crimes. The judge was told that Edwards fell into the wrong crowd after his mother died of cancer when he was just 11 years of age and shortly after his father suffered a brain haemorrhage. Edwards admitted handling stolen goods in relation to the piglets in a hearing at Guildford Crown Court . The court was told he had a catalogue . of previous convictions dating back to 2008 for thefts, motoring . offences and handling stolen goods. 'This is undoubtedly a very intelligent young man with a troubled and difficult background,' said Mr Marshall. 'He recognises where he is now and that is not a place where he wants to remain.' Edwards, who appeared in court wearing a blue T-shirt and grey tracksuit bottoms, showed no emotion as Recorder Alexia Durran outlined the offences he had admitted. She said: 'Theft of livestock is a prevalent offence that is feared by the rural community, although I accept that this is not a theft but handling stolen goods. 'You clearly did not have the skills or knowledge of animal husbandry to look after those pigs. 'I am told that you are an intelligent young man and it is a shame that you did not use that intelligence in a more constructive way.' Edwards was jailed for a total of 28 months. He was handed a four-month term of imprisonment for handling stolen goods, 12 months for aggravated vehicle taking, and a further 12 months for burglary all to be served consecutively. He was given a separate one-month sentence for criminal damage, to be served concurrently. Edwards waved to his family as he was taken to the cells to start his sentence.","Sam Edwards, 18, jailed for selling two of the nine stolen animals ."

Waitresses who worked at the Tilted Kilt - a Celtic-themed sports bar where staff are required to wear skimpy tartan skirts and matching bras - are suing management at one branch for sexual harassment. The lawsuit filed by 19 women claimed that a manager groped them and made filthy, degrading remarks - often in front of patrons. The waitresses all worked at the Tilted Kilt franchise in the Loop, downtown Chicago. Skirting the issue: The Tilted Kilt sports bar in Chicago is being sued by 19 former waitresses who claim they were sexually harassed by a manager (posed by model) The Tilted Kilt branch in Chicago had yet to respond to several calls from MailOnline. Mark Roth, a lawyer representing the women, said they were forced to endure insults and were degraded while trying to do their jobs. According to CBS Chicago, one manager grabbed the women's breasts and buttocks, tried to kiss one of them and put ice down their skirts. He also allegedly told one waitress: 'Meow, meow. You’re a dirty kitty' and made comments about pornography to another. Mr Roth told the TV station: 'There were requests for sex. There were degrading comments that were . made. Something that no woman should have to put up with anywhere, let . alone by their manager in the workforce.'

A murderer who broke his leg in jail has launched a legal battle to be downgraded to a lower security prison - on grounds he can no longer get away. 'Potentially highly dangerous' Andre Reich says all the authorities need to do to reduce the risk he poses to society is 'take away his stick'. Reich, now in his 60s, was jailed for life at Lewes Crown Court in 1992 for the murder of a young woman, and is currently a high security Category A prisoner at HMP Long Lartin, near Evesham. Yesterday he won the first stage of his publicly-funded legal fight to become a Category B inmate - after he told London’s High Court his broken leg reduces his risk to the public. The court heard Reich long ago served the 15-year minimum term set on his life sentence, but is still seen as 'potentially highly dangerous' because he has never admitted his crime. Despite a prison panel recommending he be downgraded in April last year, the Government’s Director of High Security, Danny McAllister, blocked the move, ordering he remain under the tightest security conditions. His decision stated: 'We are still no nearer to understanding the motivations behind his carefully planned act of violence against a young woman. 'The director also noted that his offending history had also evidenced a propensity for violence.' Andre Reich was jailed for life in 1992 for the murder of a young woman, and is currently a high security Category A prisoner at HMP Long Lartin, near Evesham . But Bernard Richmond QC, for Reich, told the High Court too little regard had been given to his reduced mobility, due to his broken leg, when deciding on his prison status. He said: 'If someone is dependent on a stick for their mobility and they are in pain, then that is a very significant matter when considering risk. He added: 'One way to manage Mr Reich’s risk is to take his stick away.' Lawyers for the Director of High Security conceded Reich is 'no spring chicken', but said there was no clear medical evidence to suggest his risk of reoffending was reduced. Judge Stephen Males QC ruled Reich’s complaints 'arguable' and granted him permission for a full judicial review of the decision not to downgrade him, which will be held later this year.",Andre Reich says all the authorities need to do is 'take away his stick' to reduce his risk to society .

The man accused of killing his new bride as they honeymooned in Australia wept as a police interview tape was played out in court, in which he described his failed attempts to resuscitate his wife. Gabe Watson, 34, is accused of drowning Tina Watson, 26, in 2003 by turning off her air supply when they were scuba diving, prosecutors say. During the taped interview, Watson told Townville detectives that he thought other divers in the Queensland vicinity would think 'something odd was going on,' as he struggled to save his wife. Arriving at court: Gabe Watson (centre) and his new wife Kim enter court on the third day of his trial for allegedly killing his wife Tina Watson during their 2003 honeymoon . Horrific death: Tina Thomas Watson is seen lying on the bottom of the sea in this chilling photo as a rescuer rushes to save her in October 2003 - this photo was shown in court . The police interview, recorded five . days after his wife's death, was played to the jury on the third day of . Watson's murder trial underway in Birmingham, Alabama. Watson said during the struggle he was breathing heavily and was attempting to activate his wife's buoyancy control vest. 'In . the back of my mind I was thinking these people could see us, or at . least think something was odd going on,' Watson told detectives. 'I pretty much lost it,' Watson told Townsville detectives. As the court listened to his voice, defence lawyer Brett Bloomston handed Watson a box of tissues and patted him on the shoulder. Watson and Tina Watson married in their home state of Alabama just 11 days before her death. They were in Australia on their honeymoon and were on the first . day of a week long diving trip off the coast of Queensland when she . died. Watson told . police 'five to seven minutes' into their dive over the SS Yongala . shipwreck they struggled against a strong current. He said Tina Watson got into . difficulty and at one point banged his mask and air regulator. He said he thought he kicked his wife with his fin to get some space from her and she floated away from him. Preparing: Gabe Watson, right, talks with his attorney Michael Hanle at the Mel Bailey Criminal Justice Center in Birmingham, Alabama, on Monday. He is accused of killing newly-wed bride Tina Watson . In court: Gabe Watson, with wife Kim, wait in the courtroom for jury selection to begin at the trial on Monday . 'She was out of arm's reach,' Watson said in the police interview. Jewellery: This was the ring being worn by Gabe Watson's new wife Kim outside court on Monday . Watson said he swam down to get her, but decided against chasing her to the seabed and instead headed for the surface. 'I remember shouting through my regulator 'Tina, Tina, Tina',' Watson told police. The jury of eight women and six men also looked at a haunting underwater photo taken by another diver of the death scene. It showed Tina sprawled in deep water as Watson swam to the surface. Prosecutors appeared to attempt to cast doubt on Watson's version of what happened. They believe Watson turned off his . wife's air supply while both were underwater and held her in a bear-hug . until she lost consciousness - before turning the air back on and . letting her sink. They elicited testimony that . Gabe Watson, now 34, was certified as an open water scuba diver, an . advanced diver, rescue diver and specialty diver. Earlier . yesterday, Townsville detective senior constable Kevin Gehringer, who . conducted two taped interviews with Watson, testified from the witness . box. Married again: Gabe Watson, along with his new wife Kim, prepares to enter the Mel Bailey Criminal Justice Center in Birmingham, Alabama, on Monday, ahead of jury selection for his trial . Was it murder? Gabe Watson says his wife Tina Watson died as the result of a terrible diving accident . On the day Tina . Watson died, the detective said Watson became agitated when told police . could not give him back his dive computer. The dive computer, which looks like a large watch, tracks a swimmer's dive. 'At . that stage he became a little agitated about not getting it that . night,' Det Snr Const Gehringer told the Jefferson County courtroom. The . dive computer, which Watson wore on his wrist while diving is . considered key by the prosecution to prove its case that Watson lied to . investigator. Prosecutors . contend that shortly after Watson and his wife entered the water for . their drive, Watson signaled to his wife to return to the boat because . his dive computer was beeping, indicating the battery was incorrectly . installed. He borrowed a coin from someone on the boat to remove the battery and turned it around, and the couple continued their dive. Prosecutors believe that it was a ploy to get his wife away from other divers so he . could drown her. They also argue that a dive computer wouldn't beep if . the battery was installed incorrectly - it would stay silent. Facing closure: Tommy and Cindy Thomas will finally see their former son-in-law tried for their daughter's murder when the case begins Monday in an Alabama courtroom . Watson's . lawyer, Brett Bloomstom, intends to present testimony that the . Australian police never contacted the computer's manufacturer to see if . the dive computer beeps when the battery is in upside down. Watson’s defence team claimed the . prosecution is based on ‘bumbling’ detectives in Australia believing . that a problem with a dive computer on his wrist proved he killed the . woman he loved. That mistake early in the . investigation made police wrongly see innocent actions and circumstances . as proof of a crime, defence lawyer Brett Bloomston told the court in . Birmingham, Alabama. 'Tina trusted her husband,’ Mr Arrington told the court, while Watson’s new wife Kim . Lewis, who bears a strong resemblance to Tina, sat listening. ‘She felt . safe diving with him.’ Rather than being murdered, Tina . struggled and knocked off her husband's air supply and diving mask, . forcing him to resurface without her, Mr Bloomston said. She drowned on . her own, he said. ‘This is a tragic case,’ Mr Bloomston . said. ‘What's even more tragic is the blame Gabe has had to live with . this last number of years.’ He added that Tina’s father was the . beneficiary on her life insurance. That policy was worth only $33,000, . not the $165,000 claimed by prosecutors, he said, and a travel policy . for $45,000 was only to cover the cost of the trip. ‘There was no . financial motive,’ Mr Bloomston said. Mr Bloomston argued that Tina Watson . contributed to her own death by waiving an orientation dive and placing . too much weight in a device meant to help her stay underwater during the . dive. She panicked once during a diving . class in a flooded suburban rock quarry, Mr Bloomston said, suggesting . that she may have panicked again in the fatal dive. 'This is a tragic case. What's even more tragic is the blame Gabe has had to live with this last number of years' Brett Bloomston, defending . Mr Bloomston denied prosecution claims . that Watson was a highly trained rescue diver who should have been able . to save Tina, and instead said they were both ‘very inexperienced’ underwater. Watson initially was charged with . murder in Australia, after Tina’s body was found near Townsville, . Queensland, but he pleaded guilty to a lesser manslaughter charge and . served 18 months in prison. A grand jury in Alabama also indicted . him for capital murder as he allegedly planned his new bride's death . while still in the state. A judge granted a defence motion to have one . murder count dropped. Remarried: Gabe Watson remarried, to Kim Lewis, pictured, after being released from prison in Australia . Honeymoon Horror: The newlyweds were diving at the Great Barrier Reef off Australia when Tina died . Before Australian authorities would . release Watson to the U.S., Alabama had to agree to waive the death . penalty as a possible punishment, prosecutors said. He faces life in . prison if convicted. 'There was no financial motive' Brett Bloomston, defending . Australian authorities performed . exhaustive tests to try to recreate Tina Watson's death, which occurred . soon after the couple's wedding. A coroner’s report threw up some . interesting ideas. Tina was an inexperienced diver and he . had rescue certification, the report said. The Alabama trial poses . logistical challenges, as up to a dozen witnesses will be flown in from . Australia to testify. The state of Alabama has also . subpoenaed people from California to testify about what happened that . day on a dive boat called the Spoilsport, but it's unclear how many will . take the stand.

"By . Ted Thornhill . Last updated at 2:20 AM on 18th February 2012 . Corrupt: Former Essex cricketer Mervyn Westfield arrives for sentencing at the Old Bailey . Former county cricketer Mervyn Westfield was jailed for four months at the Old Bailey today for spot-fixing. He will serve half the term in prison. Westfield, 23, was paid £6,000 to bowl so that a specific number of runs would be chalked up in the first over of a match between Durham and Essex in September 2009. Today the Old Bailey heard that teammate and former Pakistan player Danish Kaneria told him that a friend would pay him to concede a certain number of runs off his bowling. Prosecutor Nigel Peters QC told the court that the deal emerged when another Essex player, Tony Palladino, went back to Westfield’s Chelmsford flat in September 2009, where the bowler showed him 'the most money he had ever seen'. Westfield pleaded guilty last month to one count of accepting or obtaining a corrupt payment to bowl in a way that would allow the scoring of runs. Kaneria was arrested in connection with the case but later released without charge. Westfield has received an interim suspension order from the England and Wales Cricket Board. The court heard that Kaneria, who first joined Essex in 2005, was warned in 2008 by the ICC that he was keeping 'highly inappropriate company'. Mark Milliken-Smith QC, for Westfield, told the court: 'It is clear, we submit, that Kaneria and his associates targeted Westfield. Westfield was on the verge of the squad, more susceptible for that reason. Less likely perhaps to be able to say no to the club’s international star, his future with the club uncertain.' Essex County Cricket Club: Westfield took the bung for a match he played for the club against Durham in 2009 . Money-grabber: Westfield is the first county cricketer in England to be prosecuted for spot-fixing . The match was one of the first televised games that Westfield had played in. Mr Milliken-Smith said Kaneria took Westfield out to dinner with some friends, and said he had a way that the young cricketer could make money more quickly. Implicated: Westfield's teammate Danish Kaneria was named in court as telling him a friend would pay him money to perform badly . He said Westfield felt 'pressured' to become involved as discussions intensified. The day before the game, the fast bowler, then 21, was told that people had bet money on the match and that if he did not agree to the deal they would lose out. The court was told that other Essex players heard Kaneria mentioning spot-fixing but dismissed what he was saying as 'banter'. Varun Chopra said that in a phone call in August 2009 Kaneria told him 'There’s ways of making money, you don’t have to lose a game'. He ignored the alleged approach. Mr Milliken-Smith told the court that despite these rumours at Essex County Cricket Club, a 'blind eye' was turned, and opportunities to report the allegations were initially missed. Mr Milliken-Smith told the court that Westfield, who has played the sport since he was six, was 'an Essex cricketer through and through'. He said: 'He bitterly regrets what he has done, he is utterly ashamed.' Mr Milliken-Smith added: 'He is a life-long and passionate cricket fan and player. In fact, he knows no other love. 'The shame and regret he feels is evidenced at least in part by his admissions as to his involvement to this court.'",Former Pakistan star Danish Kaneria told him a friend would pay to have runs conceded .
"By . Claire Bates . Last updated at 12:09 AM on 8th February 2012 . Smacking is banned in 20 European countries but still legal with some restrictions in the U.S and UK . Spanking or slapping your child if they misbehave could make them more aggressive with others later in life, scientists claim. A review of 20 years worth of research found that the more often children were slapped, spanked or yelled at when they were naughty the more likely they were to display similar behaviour when they grew up. Researchers Dr Joan Durrant from the . Univeristy of Manitoba and Ron Ensom of the Children's Hospital of . Eastern Ontario, wrote in the . Canadian Medical Association Journal: 'Virtually without exception, . these studies found that physical punishment was associated with higher . levels of aggression against parents, siblings, peers and spouses.' It comes just a week after Labour MP David Lammy said last summer's riots were a result of parents being unable to physically discipline their children for fear that social workers would take them away. Calling for a return to the Victorian laws on discipline, the MP said it was easier for middle-class . parents to control their children as they could afford to pay for . private schools, which have tougher discipline than state schools, as . well as activities such as tennis lessons. He said: 'Many of my constituents . came up to me after the riots and blamed the Labour Government, saying, ""You guys stopped us being able to smack our children.""' However, the authors of the latest review said spanking children could be counter-productive. They pointed to one study of 500 families that found children were less likely to challenge adults when the parents were trained to stop punishing them physically. They added that many of the studies found that raising a hand to a child increased their chances of developing mental health problems such as depression. Is spanking necessary to discipline children? The authors noted that societies view of physical punishment had changed over the past 20 years and it was no longer considered the best way to deal with unruly children. In the U.S a recent poll found most parents said they used 'time outs' or took away favourite toys as punishment. However, a fifth said they were 'very likely' to spank their children. Smacking is . currently legal in the U.S with some restrictions which vary from state . to state. However, it is banned in 20 . European countries, including Germany, Spain and the Netherlands. In Britain 'reasonable chastisement' in the home is allowed however this was not allowed to 'leave a mark' on the skin from 2004. A recent poll found 71 . per cent of parents would support a smacking ban. The authors said doctors should help parents learn non-violent, effective approaches to discipline, as many don't understand what prompts a child's behaviour. Dr Durrant told MyHealthNewsDaily: 'They (parents) are more likely to believe that their child is being defiant or intentionally bad, but in most cases, children are simply doing what is normal for their development.' Techniques include recognising that . toddlers tend to say no to everything and ignoring them for 10 seconds when they act up before redirecting their behaviour. Another method is to lay down rules but also explain why they are used.",Last week Labour MP David Lammy said summer riots due to parents being unable to use physical discipline .

MIT students celebrated the 50th birthday of Spacewar - one of the earliest computer games, written in 1962 on an MIT computer the size of a fridge. The game was written by four students in 1962 on a PDP-1 'minicomputer' - last week, MIT students built a new version that ran on a palm-sized electronics rig, based on the original code programmed 40 years ago. It was one of the earliest computer games, and arguably the forefather of all arcade-style space games. The game was programmed by four MIT students in 1962 on a PDP-1 'minicomputer', a fridge-sized device. The online version uses the same 40 pages of computer code to run . The code of the game runs to 40 pages, . and it can still be played online, in a version constantly updated to . run in the latest browser code. The game was created in a room known as the 'Kludge Room' at MIT, where computing students would play around with the latest hardware. The hulking PDP-1 'minicomputer' was a relatively modern machine, with controls that allowed an 'action packed' game where two spaceships battled one another around a sun which pulled them in with gravity. The game is the ancestor of games such as Asteroids. Spacewar became a cult hit, being played and adapted by computing students around the world. It was released as a coin-operated arcade machine called Computer Space in the Seventies, and has been released under various names on many computers since. The game ran on a PDP-1 'minicomputer'. The programmers shared it with other labs around the world, and other computers added their own variations .","'Ancestor' of Asteroids was programmed on fridge-sized computer in 1962 .

"By . Lauren Paxman . Last updated at 5:05 PM on 17th February 2012 . A little girl bleeding from a head wound was turned away from a doctor's surgery - because she wasn't registered as a patient. Four-year-old Libby Finlow suffered a serious cut on her head when she fell against a wall whilst running along a corridor at the Waters Green Medical centre in Macclesfield, Cheshire. Her parents Janna Russell and David Finlow picked the youngster up, ran across the corridor to the Park Lane surgery - one of six GP surgeries within the centre - and begged the receptionist for help. Turned away: Four-year-old Libby Finlow suffered a serious cut on her head when she fell against a wall, but was sent away from the closest surgery . But even though Mr Finlow, 25, was registered as a patient there, they were turned away and told Libby had to be taken to her own doctor instead. The youngster was eventually treated at a neighbouring clinic, at which she was registered as a patient, just feet away in the same building where she was bandaged up. Her parents then took her to Macclesfield Hospital where her wound was stitched before taking her home, but she had to return the next day and was kept in overnight with suspected concussion. The family have since complained to the Park Lane surgery and have received a letter in return stating that the staff were following the centre's existing protocol, but confirming that the practice will review how the event was dealt with in order to learn for the future and apologising for any stress and inconvenience caused. Ms Russell, 24, a nursery . nurse, said: 'We find it disgusting that they could turn away anyone, . let alone a child. We were in shock. All we wanted was basic first aid.' Libby's father, Mr Finlow, said: 'We put a complaint in to the surgery and they responded with a letter of apology saying they'd followed protocol and this and that and the other. Out of danger: Libby (left) pictured with her parents David and Janna, and brothers Charlie (centre) and Josh . 'We're just in the process of responding and saying yes we accept your apology however we still don't feel you followed protocol. 'I wouldn't like it if I'd fallen over and they'd pushed me somewhere else but a child of three, as she was at the time, is terrible.' The couple, from Macclesfield, Cheshire, had gone to the medical centre, which houses six GP surgeries around a common atrium, with Libby and their younger children, Joshua, three, and Charlie, one, to pick up a prescription from the pharmacy for David when the incident occurred on January 23. Mr Finlow, who works as a chef, said: 'We'd gone into the doctors to get a repeat prescription and, going into the toilet, Libby had fallen over and bumped her head. 'I picked her up and ran into the Park Lane Surgery and said can you help me? 'Libby was bleeding quite heavily, she had blood all down her face, top and coat and I had blood all down me. 'I was panicked, I was worried, shocked, everything just sort of set in. I just wanted her cleaned up to check out what was going on. 'I just ran to the nearest doctor thinking obviously this is the place, they'll help. I said can somebody help me and they said ""is she registered here"" and I said ""no, but I am"" but she [the receptionist] just said ""well, you'll have to take her to her own doctor"". Recovery process: Libby pictured three days after the accident (left) and now . 'I was just disgusted, I was speechless. It was just a case of the obvious place to get her sorted would be the doctors and it felt like they didn't want to help just because they were busy. 'I ran out, her doctors is on the same floor and I ran there and said ""can somebody help me?"". They didn't ask if she was registered they just saw her and two nurses rushed in and started to bandage her up and help. 'Libby was very upset, she was just crying more than anything else and I think she was in a bit of shock as well. 'We went to the hospital to get her stitched up and brought her home and she stayed at home that night but was vomiting still the next day. So we phoned the hospital because she carried on being sick and they said if she's sick more than three times to bring her in, so we did.' Libby was given an anti-sickness tablet but she threw it back up so she was given a cannula and an injection and kept in overnight for observation as doctors suspected she may have concussion. Following protocol: The Finlow family have received a letter from the Central and East Cheshire PCT apologising 'if the parents felt the accident was dealt with inappropriately' David said: 'She's a lot better now, she's still got a scar on her head but she's back to her normal self, happy and chatty and into everything as they are at that age.' A spokeswoman from Central and East Cheshire PCT, which runs the centre, said: 'We are very sorry to hear of the injuries the child sustained and would like to apologise if the parents felt the accident was dealt with inappropriately by a member of the Park Lane reception staff. 'A letter has been sent by the practice to the parents to offer an explanation and an apology. 'At Waters Green Medical Centre there is a protocol for dealing with accidents in what are called ""common areas"" like the atrium. One of the practices in Waters Green is responsible for responding to emergency calls each month. Usually a nurse or GP from the ""on call"" practice assesses the situation and if an ambulance is not required then the patient is advised to attend their registered practice where their medical notes are held. 'The practice ""on call"" in January was High Street Surgery which in this situation, was not called. The Park Lane receptionist was responding to the protocol described above in asking where the child was registered and suggesting the parent take her to her registered surgery. 'Both the surgery and the PCT do understand that in this circumstance, a more natural reaction for the receptionist would have been to take the child to a nurse for first aid. As a result of this, the practice will review this event and how it was dealt with in order that lessons for the future are learned.'","Libby Finlow fell over and cut her head inside a medical centre, but was turned away from the closest GP surgery .

The RnBXclusive front page in July 2011, showing links to share music by artists such as Sean Paul. The site is estimated to have cost the music industry £15M a month . The site has been targeted by the organised crime agency because users are said to have stolen pre-release music from record labels to share via the site. SOCA says that the site's activities cost the music industry £15 million a year. One individual has been arrested so far. It's not clear whether SOCA will take further action against users of the site. The warning also automatically tells users details such as their IP address, which can be used to identify their location in a criminal investigation.

'As a result of illegal downloads young, emerging artists may have had their careers damaged. If you have illegally downloaded music you will have damaged the future of the music industry.' Loz Kaye of UK activist group Pirate Party said, 'The claim that the information gathered can be used to identify visitors, followed by a statement that Soca has the capability to monitor, investigate and inform visitors internet service providers of apparent 'infringements', making visitors liable for prosecution seems extreme and unduly threatening.'

A father has attacked a celebrity culture which 'glorifies and trivalises' drug taking after his 16-year-old son died from taking ecstasy sold to him at a nightclub. Public school deputy head Tom Simons said his son, Joe, was the victim of a ‘complacent’ approach to drug use, which he said was ‘spreading like a cancer’. Joe, who had nine A* GCSEs, was let into the club despite being under-age and bought 1.5g of the ecstasy powder MDMA from a dealer inside, an inquest heard. He collapsed hours later and died in hospital the following day. It was only the second time he had used the drug. Yesterday his friends told the hearing that dealers were ‘openly’ selling drugs at Lakota nightclub in Bristol, which had its licence suspended after Joe’s death. In a statement read to the inquest, Mr Simons, deputy head of £25,000-per-year Prior Park College in Bath, said: ‘Joe is in many ways an indictment of our failure as a society to tackle the scourge of drugs. There are no easy answers of course and we are daily beset by the views and advice of the well-meaning and the misguided, urging us to legalise drugs or build more jails. ‘It is complacency that is the greatest challenge to us all. We never think it will happen to us or our loved ones. We trust it will not be our child who will be tempted.' Lakota nightclub in Bristol has had its licence suspended since Joe's death . Drug dealing: Joe bought ecstasy inside the Lakota nightclub in Bristol. It was only the second time he had taken it . Too late: Joe collapsed after friends notice he had turned grey . He continued: ‘Until society as a . whole stands up and says no to the dealers and no to those in the media . and entertainments industry who glorify and trivialise the taking of . drugs, we will continue to count the cost in lives lost and families . left bereft.’ The . 51-year-old added: ‘It is our profound hope that Joe’s untimely death . will serve as a warning to young people of the dangers of taking drugs . like MDMA and the far from benign influence that some would have us . believe the ‘soft’ drugs culture has on young people.’ The inquest at Flax Bourton, near Bristol, was told that Joe – an A-level student at Beechen Cliff sixth form, in Bath – went to the club on April 30 last year and bought around 1.5g of the white crystalline substance, some of which he took with water. Bright: Joe aspired to attend Oxford or Cambridge University . His best friend, Gabriel Wheatcroft, told the inquest that after Joe became ill, ‘I heard one of the door staff saying that if they were asked, they would say he bought it earlier from another club’. Joe died in hospital. Shortly after his death, Mr Simons said: ‘Joe died, in part, because the system failed to protect him that night and it seems to me that this is, at least in part, due to indifference to the hedonistic and destructive culture of drug-taking that seems to be more and more a routine part of nightlife for young people.’ Toxicology results revealed that Joe had 0.98 micrograms of the drug in his blood. Pathologist Dr Edward Sheffield said a normal recreational level for the drug would be about 0.2 micrograms. Mr Simons told the inquest his son’s death had been a ‘tsunami’ on their family – as Joe’s mother Brenda had died from lung cancer three years ago. Terence Moore, assistant deputy coroner for Avon, gave Joe’s cause of death as toxicity due to ecstasy.","Joe Simons, 16 had nine A* GCSEs and wanted to go to Oxford or Cambridge .

"By . Deborah Arthurs . Last updated at 1:18 PM on 17th February 2012 . Britain's top models have been banned from using sunbeds ahead of appearing on the catwalks at London Fashion Week. Leading model agencies have signed up to support a No Sunbed Policy for all their models as the four-day event opens today. The initiative comes in support of Cancer Research UK's R UV UGLY campaign, which is warning Britons about the health risks of using sunbeds. Bronzed: Victoria's Secret model Behati Prinsloo tops up her tan ahead of a photo shoot - but while real sun tanning is safer than sunbeds, experts insist sunless tanning is the only safe method . Directors from 11 UK model agencies including Elite, Premier Model Managedment Storm and Next have signed up for the zero tolerance policy on sunbed use to protect new and established models from the health and cosmetic impact of  using the ultra-violet tanning beds. Cancer Research based the proposed ban on findings that reveal the first time use of a sunbed before the age of 35 increases the risk of malignant melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, by 75 per cent. Models on the New York catwalk this week sported light tans - difficult to achieve in winter without artificial methods. But Cancer Research and model agencies are urging girls to use spray tans, not sunbeds . Using a sunbed once a month or more - something that many women consider to be minimal use - can increase the risk of melanoma by 50 per cent. Sarah Doukas, Managing Director of Storm Model Management, commented: 'Storm Model Management is pleased to support the No Sunbed Policy. 'Supporting this campaign makes perfect sense as the wellbeing of our models is of paramount importance and we take a serious approach to their health. Dying for a tan: First use of a sunbed before the age of 35 increases risk of melanoma - the most dangerous form of skin cancer - by 75 per cent . 'We do not advocate the use of sunbeds for any of our models, and recommend that they choose safer options if they require a tan -  spray tans are easy to apply and can last a week. 'It is well documented that UV from sunbeds can cause serious skin damage, especially in the under 35s.' Michelangelo Chiacchio, the CEO of Elite Model Management London commented: 'The welfare of our models is of the utmost importance to Elite Model Management. Using a sunbed once a month or more - . something that many women consider to be minimal use - can increase the . risk of melanoma by 50 per cent. 'We hope that this will help to send out a strong message to young girls and guys that sunbeds will have a negative impact on their appearance. 'We strive to support the health of our models and will never condone the use of sunbeds for any job; instead we will always try to arrange for a spray tan should it be necessary.' Carole White, Co-Founder of Premier Model Management, echoed this view: 'Premier Model Management pride ourselves on taking care of our models’ welfare and strongly support the view that models should never use a sunbed.' Chris Lunn, SunSmart campaign manager at Cancer Research UK, said: 'We’re delighted that leading model agencies are backing our R UV UGLY? campaign. 'Using sunbeds can make your skin coarse, leathery and wrinkly. The UV rays from a sunbed can also damage the DNA in your skin. 'Over time, this  damage can build up and may lead to melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer. So, if you feel you must have a tan, it  is safer to fake it.' After peaking in the eighties, sunbed use was thought to be heading towards a decline in the UK, but prevalence of the artificial tanning beds on television shows such as TOWIE and Big Fat Gypsy Weddings, the latter of which shows underage girls tanning on beds, and thanks to promotion by stars such as Katie Price, who frequently talks of using them, their popularity has had something of a resurgence. A current resurgence of the trend for tanned skin has only provided more pressure upon young girls. It is widely believed that French fashion designer Coco Chanel first popularised the suntan. In 1923, she stepped off the Duke of Westminster's yacht after having been on a Mediterranean cruise sporting a deep bronze tan. Previously, tanned skin had been the mark of the outdoor labourer, and therefore one from the lower classes. Suddenly, when Coco Chanel dared to suntan, it became the mark of luxury, a status symbol for the wealthy . upper-classes who could afford to tan out of season. A dangerous invention? A Portasun PR poses in one of the firm's sunbeds at the ideal Home Exhibition in 1985. At the time, their solarium - one of the earlier models for use within the home, cost £799 . Then, most tans were achieved the natural way. But with the invention of mass produced ultraviolet sunbeds in 1978,  women could tan all year long  (an early version was invented 86 years earlier in 1891 by John Harvey Kellogg, who created an Incandescent Light Bath, said to have been installed by King Edward VII in Buckingham Palace and Windsor Palace to relieve his gout). In the Eighties, when affordable personal tanning beds entered the mass market, consumers could even tan from the comfort of their own homes. As more research was carried out, the medical industry realised that tans, and sunbed tans in particular, were a leading cause of melanoma, and a trend for using self-tanning creams and bronzing gels took over. As with all things fashion-related, the trend for a tan is cyclical, ebbing and flowing with the times. The so-called heroin chic look . popularised by models and designers in the Nineties that demanded skin . be pale to the point of translucence has given way to the new brand of . beauty for the Noughties - one that puts high  value hair, nails and tan . being entirely artificial. What never changes, however, is just how dangerous a sunbed tan can be. The . R UV UGLY campaign is urging all Britons to face the invisible damage, . lurking beneath the skin, that is caused by sunbeds caused, by offering . exclusive skin scans at skin clinics nationwide until March. People can . book by text, phone or by visiting www.mepls.com/ruvugly.","Leading model agencies join No Sunbed Policy .

Spectacular launch: Madonna performs her new single during half time at the Super Bowl earlier this month . Just a week after entering the British charts at a lowly 37, however, the song – the first taste of Madonna’s new album, MDNA – looks likely to drop out of the top 40 completely this weekend. The latest figures suggest it could plummet down to 51 by tomorrow if current sales levels continue. It is one of the worst showings in almost three decades of chart hits for the singer in a career that has generated 13 UK number ones. Give Me All Your Luvin' was her first new track for three years - and a first release under a new three-album deal she signed with music giant Universal. Here's Madonna! The megastar is first seen pushing a pram from a supernatural looking surburban home in the video . Normal service resumed: It's not long before Madonna is back down to her hotpants, and surrounding by football players - fittingly . Although Madonna's previous single Revolver fared worse in 2009, reaching only number 130, it had already been available on a greatest hits album Celebration for three months prior to its release. The 53-year-old's single prior to that, also entitled Celebration, went to number three in 2009. Some downloads of Give Me All Your Luvin' were given away last week as a free bonus track for fans who pre-ordered the album, which meant they did not count towards the chart placing. Some fans thought the chart position had been affected by this and would recover this week, but sales have been ever fewer. It is the first time the lead track from one of her albums has not gone into the top ten since her debut single in 1982. And most new songs have made it into the top three.

The woman, 24, got out of her silver Mitsubishi Lancer Evo when it was hit from behind by a silver BMW M3 containing two men. As she argued about who was responsible for the collision one of the man jumped in her vehicle and drove off in Waterlooville, Hampshire, yesterday. Sports car: The mother, 24, was driving a Mitsubishi Evo Lancer when she was rammed from behind and had her car stolen (file picture) The second man drove off in the same direction in the BMW. She later discovered the vehicle abandoned outside a school just a mile up the road with her son still sat in the back. A passing motorist picked her up and helped her search for the stolen car. The mother, from Waterlooville, who did not wish to be identified, said: 'When I approached the car I could see he was visibly shaken and he (my son) reached out for me. He was clearly upset.' The mother and child had visited a . local Asda supermarket and were on their way home when the BMW collided . with the rear of their car. She continued: 'As I imagine anyone . would do, I got out of the car to speak to the other driver. It never . crossed my mind that while I was doing this my car would be driven away. 'When this happened my first thought was for my son who was still in the vehicle. I panicked and tried to get help. 'It was an amazingly traumatic incident. Thankfully another driver stopped to help me and I'm so grateful for that. 'The relief of finding that the car had been abandoned with my son inside was indescribable. 'I really hope police can now find those responsible.' The boy was not injured. Witnesses say they saw two men leave . the Mitsubishi outside the school and drive away in a BMW, hitting a . white Mercedes van before fleeing.

"By . Richard Shears . Last updated at 11:23 AM on 5th November 2011 . A two-year-old boy playing with his toy wheelbarrow was bowled over by a kangaroo which then pinned him down and tried to claw him to death. The screaming child's terrified parents ran at the animal and managed to chase it away - but not before it left Zakkiah Galea with severe wounds to his face and body. His mother Nicole Galea last night told how the aggressive kangaroo left her in fear that her son had received fatal injuries in the attack on the family's ten-acre property at Port Macquarie, in northern New South Wales. In hospital: Two-year-old Zakkiah Galea was playing in his garden in New South Wales when he was attacked by a kangaroo which tried to claw him to death . Mrs Galea, who is eight-months . pregnant, said: 'The kangaroo was on top of him. He was pinned to the . ground while it clawed at his forearms. 'I screamed at the kangaroo to get off him but it wouldn't - it just kept on attacking.' It . was only when Zakkiah's father, Andrew Galea, rushed to help his wife . fight off the kangaroo that the animal finally ran off into nearby . bushland. 'It turned on Andrew first before hopping away,' Mrs Galea told Sydney's Daily Telegraph. 'It was just awful to see Zakkiah. He had a bloody face and blood had soaked through his shirt. 'There was a deep puncture in his chest and a gash on the top of his leg. He had two large gouges from his mouth to his ear.' Zakkiah's mother Nicole Galea said the aggressive kangaroo left her fearing that he had received fatal injuries during the attack on the family's ten-acre property at Port Macquarie . Native species: The kangaroo only hopped away when it was scared off by the boy's father (file picture) Last night, Zakkiah was recovering at home from his wounds that required 13 stitches. His mother said: 'He scared. He says he doesn't want to be attacked by the ""tiger kangaroo"" again.' Other people in the remote neighbourhood have been attacked by kangaroos, said Mrs Galea, and she suspected urban development was to blame - new houses forcing the animals into human environment. Peter Clark, of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, said people should be aware that kangaroos are wild animals of substantial size and power and might react instinctively and attack if they are startled. He suggested that people living close to kangaroos should fence off their properties and remove food, shelter and water opportunities. He also suggesting turning on water sprinklers to discourage the animals from gathering.","Zakkiah Galea, two, pinned down in New South Wales .

"By . Katherine Faulkner and Mario Ledwith . Last updated at 6:54 AM on 18th February 2012 . The body of Laurence Mullany-Mills, six, was found just before 4am yesterday by Lincolnshire Police underwater search unit officers . This is the first picture of Laurence Mullany-Mills, six, who drowned in a freezing lake along with his grandmother during an outing to feed the ducks. The alarm was raised when Dawn Mullany, 71, and Laurence failed to return to his home on Thursday night. Police began a major search operation helped by friends and neighbours. An RAF helicopter was deployed. They had found Mrs Mullany’s house empty and then discovered her car near the duck pond in the hamlet of  Holywell, Lincolnshire. She was found in the water soon afterwards and, despite efforts to resuscitate the pensioner, she was certified dead at the scene. Teams searched through the night for the missing boy, hoping he would be found alive. Tragically, his body was found just before 4am yesterday by Lincolnshire Police underwater search unit officers. His parents, Asmina Mullany-Mills and Vaughan Mills, both 41, who also have a daughter Nancy, 15 months, were too upset to speak last night. A spokesman for Lincolnshire Police said the family was ‘in a terrible way’. Neighbours described Laurence as ‘a lovely little boy’ from a ‘close, loving family’. Carol Spall, 73, who lives next door, said: ‘He was always an adventurous little boy. Everyone he met fell in love with him. ‘We would see his little head peering over the garden wall, he always wanted to stop and have a chat. ‘He endeared himself to everyone. He was a lovely little boy. This is so horrendous, they were such a close, loving family.’ Laurence, known as Laurie, was a pupil at Ketton Church of England Primary School, she said. Tragedy: Laurence and his grandmother, Dawn Mullany, died in this pond in Holywell, near Castle Bytham, Lincolnshire . ‘He was such a cheeky little character,’ Miss Spall added. ‘I can’t imagine how they will cope without him. I was saying to Asmina not long ago what a credit her children were to her and her husband. ‘They are such good parents and such charming children. Laurie was a good big brother to Nancy, he was very caring.’ The family had recently returned from a holiday in New Zealand to spend Christmas with Mr Mills’s family. Miss Spall’s partner Addison Wishalt, 73, added: ‘Laurie was very intelligent and articulate. It is believed the pair fell into the freezing water earlier in the day while feeding the swans and ducks in the remote pond . Detective Chief Inspector David Wood at the scene of the tragedy in Lincolnshire . ‘He was very keen on rugby and he told us he wanted to learn to play the violin. The other day I saw little Laurie and his mum walking either side of Nancy helping her to walk to the shop. She’s just learning now and Laurie was keen to help teach her.’ The couple said Mrs Mullany was a ‘gracious lady’. Miss Spall added: ‘She was very kind and adored her grandchildren. She was very capable, you would trust her to look after anybody in the world. ‘For the family to lose her and  little Laurie is beyond a tragedy.’ The lake, which stretches the length of the hamlet, is frequented by dozen of swans and ducks. It is surrounded by a grass verge and there is a concrete platform for feeding the birds. Mrs Mullany was described by her neighbours as ‘a sweet, lovely lady’ who had lived in the village of Castle Bytham,  Lincolnshire, for around 30 years. Last night, they told how she had suffered tragedy in her life, including the death of her father in  wartime action in 1943 when she was a baby. In 1977, her husband, Firozali, died aged just 35. A neighbour, who joined the search after police knocked on his door, said: ‘She was great with kids and loved them to bits. 'She was a fantastic neighbour and could not do enough to help us out.’ Muriel Cooke, Castle Bytham  Parish Council clerk, said: ‘She was a very nice lady, very cultured. It is shocking news for the village.’ Detective Chief Inspector David Wood said: ‘Both bodies were found near a grate over a sluice at one end of the pond. ‘This is a very tragic accident. There are no suspicious circumstances. There are no witnesses and we may never know exactly what happened.’ Laurence lived in Castle Bytham and the tragedy happened at a pond in the nearby village of Holywell .","Laurence Mullany-Mills spent the evening with his grandmother Dawn Mullany and was due to go home .

"By . Sara Nathan . Last updated at 8:26 AM on 18th February 2012 . When he handed her the hard-won job as his Apprentice two years ago, Lord Sugar spoke admiringly of Stella English’s determination to succeed. Now he may not see that steely resolve in quite the same light – as she is suing him for constructive dismissal. Miss English, who won the BBC1 hit show in 2010, has lodged papers with an employment tribunal after complaining she had been forced out of her job at Lord Sugar’s business empire. Apprentice winner: Stella English won the BBC1 show in 2010 but is now suing Lord Sugar for constructive dismissal after not having her £100,000-per-year contract renewed . The 32-year-old mother-of-two first lashed out at the tycoon last October after he failed to renew her £100,000-a-year contract last year, her prize for winning The Apprentice title. Miss English, who grew up on a crime-ridden South London estate, told in a newspaper interview of how her dream job had ended in tears. And the woman nicknamed The Ice Maiden because of her ruthlessness on the show  issued an ominous warning: ‘Lord Sugar has forgotten one of the first rules of business –never underestimate someone who’s got nothing to lose.’ Although there is little information available about where and when the employment case will be heard, one fact is clear. The relationship between Miss English and Lord Sugar is now 'extremely bitter’ according to sources. One well versed with the situation had advised Miss English not to go ahead with the legal action, warning her ‘you’re playing with fire’. The source added: ‘Lord Sugar had tried to help Stella. When she was unhappy in one job he moved her. ‘But it was Stella who left just two months before the contract ended, she was desperate to go.’ For Miss English, it is yet another difficult chapter in a life that has never been easy. She spent her ‘painful’ childhood in care homes and with relatives after being given up by her mother Drusilla. Before the bitterness: Stella English is all smiles in 2010 as she is crowned winner of the Apprentice . Competitors: The eight women who competed in the Apprentice in 210. From left: Laura Moore, Melissa Cohen, Paloma Vivanco, Liz Locke, Stella English, Joy Stefanicki, Sandeesh Samra and Joanna Riley . Her father had abandoned the family early on and she described growing up as ‘quite a lonely hard time for me’. Despite her tough start in life, Miss English worked her way up to become a manager on the trading floor of Japanese bank Daiwa, earning £85,000 a year before winning a place on The Apprentice. It was Lord Sugar himself who summed up her remarkable drive to succeed, declaring:  ‘At an early age you never had all these qualifications, then went out of the way to train yourself and get yourself the job that you’ve got – and that shows me a lot of determination.’ After being told ‘You’re Hired’, Miss English was given a job with Lord Sugar’s Viglen offices. Viglen provides IT systems to schools, universities and hospitals. She was to be a project manager, but claimed she had to report to a manager far more junior than her. When she asked for feedback from Lord Sugar, she claimed he told her: ‘I’ll tell you the feedback, shall I? Yeah. Nice girl, don’t do a lot.’ She was then given a new job at another of Lord Sugar’s companies, YouView. When she then complained about that role, claiming it did not require too much work, Lord Sugar ‘went off the radar’ and she did not speak to him for months. Boardroom battle: Stella English with Chris Bates in the final of the Apprentice two years ago . During her interview with the Mail on Sunday last October, Miss English told how Lord Sugar called her to a meeting on September 28 where he pointed out that her contract would be up in December. She said he told her: ‘I dunno what to do with you after that. Maybe you should think about what you want to do.’ Miss English said she wanted to stay where she was. She claimed he told her that YouView couldn’t afford to pay her and added: ‘I’ve met my obligations to you as far as I’m concerned. If you think Lord Sugar was s****ing himself when you left the Viglen job, you’re wrong, ‘cos I don’t give a s***.’ Miss English lives in South-East London with her husband Ray Dewar, the father of her two sons, who she married in March last year. Now a builder and scaffolder, he had been a notorious hard man linked to Clifford Norris, the gangster father of David Norris, one of the convicted killers of Stephen Lawrence. Last night, Lord Sugar’s spokesman Andrew Bloch declined to comment. When contacted, Miss English said she was unable to comment as she was visiting a sick relative abroad. Back in last October she was more forthcoming about her experience. Her time working for Lord Sugar had been ‘an appalling experience’, she said. ‘I’ve wasted two years of my life when I could have been doing something better.’","Stella English lashed out at the tycoon after he failed to renew her £100,000-per-year contract .

"By . Andy Dolan . Last updated at 7:50 AM on 17th February 2012 . A Polish burglar battered and stabbed an elderly couple to death at their home – a week after arriving in the UK to stay with his sister in the house next door. In a tragic irony, his victims were also immigrants to this country who, by contrast, had worked hard and built a model family life in Wolverhampton following their arrival from Italy more than 50 years ago. Killer Ireneusz Bartnowski, 22, watched grandparents Guiseppe and Caterina Massaro’s movements for several days before breaking in to their home while they were out shopping. Scroll down for video . Defenceless: Guiseppe and Caterina Massaro were battered with a claw hammer in their own Wolverhampton home in April last year . When they returned, he lay in wait in . their bedroom for ten hours until Mr Massaro, 80, and his 77-year-old . wife retired to bed, then attacked them with a knife and a foot-long . hammer. Yesterday Bartnowski, who tried to . blame a fellow Pole for the killings, was jailed for life with a minimum . tariff of 34 years after being convicted of the double murder. Mr Justice MacDuff told him: ‘You lack . all humanity, you are evil beyond belief. You have told this court . breathtaking lies in an attempt to escape justice. ‘You showed no mercy, no compassion. You left them dead upon their bedroom floor and you set about stripping . them of their valuables. This was a cold-blooded murder. Yours was an . intention to kill. You knew you had no intention but to end their . lives.’ Evil: Ireneusz Bartnowski battered the Italian grandparents before stealing two television from their house and fleeing in their car . The judge said he had been ‘moved almost to tears’ by the Massaro family’s suffering. Bartnowski, an ex-soldier, had been convicted of burglary in his homeland four years ago and given a suspended sentence. But despite the conviction he had open . access to the UK as a citizen of the European Union, under free . movement directives which stipulate that only the most serious offenders . can be turned away. He arrived in Britain by bus in April. Last night, Mr Massaro’s sister . condemned the regulations and told the Daily Mail the Polish criminal . ‘should never have been allowed in to the country’. Luisa Mastrobuono said: ‘He’s a . convicted criminal. If he’s committed crimes in one country then he will . do it again in another country.’ The victims’ granddaughter Lindsey . Booth, 24, who found their bodies on Good Friday last year, said: ‘We . hope in prison he gets what he truly deserves and is subjected to the . very pain, violence and fear my grandparents were subjected to. ‘We hope the very moments that have confined him will torment and disturb his corrupted mind every moment of every day.’ She said of the ‘vile’ killer’s . sentence: ‘The death penalty would have been the easy way out for . Bartnowski. We would rather have him suffering for what he has done for . every day of his sentence.’ Wolverhampton Crown Court heard the . Italian couple – who moved to the city from Naples in 1960 – were found . side by side by Miss Booth on the floor of the bedroom. Caught on camera: Bartnowski was filmed on CCTV entering and leaving the house . 'Evil': Bartnowski was filmed loading the stolen TVs into the Massaro's car and driving off . Probe: Forensic officers investigate the scene of the double murder in Wolverhampton in April last year . The bodies of the Massaros (right) were discovered by their granddaughter in an upstairs bedroom after the 'brutal and savage' attack . They are believed to have been . attacked the previous evening. Following the attack, Bartnowski was . caught on CCTV loading his victims’ two televisions – later sold for . £200 – into their Peugeot car and driving away. A short time later he was recorded . buying beer in a nearby Asda. The next morning he was twice filmed by a . CCTV camera returning to the property to search for ‘further pickings’. It could not be established what, if any, valuables he took. Devoted: The Massaros on their wedding day in 1957 . Peter Grieves-Smith, QC, prosecuting, . said that Mr Massaro, a factory worker before his retirement, or his . wife would have seen the other being attacked and would have known ‘the . same thing would happen to them’. Mr Massaro received blunt and sharp . force injuries to his head, neck and abdomen, with two areas of skull . fracturing caused by the hammer, which led to haemorrhaging of the . brain. His wife had stab wounds to the neck as well as defensive injuries. Bartnowski’s fingerprints and blood . were found on the murder weapons and his DNA in a pair of gloves and on a . pear he had taken a bite from in the kitchen. Mr Massaro’s DNA was . recovered from trainers found at Bartnowski’s sister’s home. But the killer tried to pin the double . killing on a 32-year-old fellow Pole, Wojciech Ostolski, telling the . jury: ‘I did not kill them. I was downstairs when it happened. I did not . want to know what he had done to the old folks.’ Ostolski, of Wolverhampton, a father . of two who came to England in 2006, denied handling the stolen property . from the Massaros’ home and was cleared by the jury. Philip Davies, the Eurosceptic Tory MP for Shipley, said: ‘This sort of incident is sickening. ‘Being an island nation, we should . have an advantage in terms of controlling who comes through our borders . but through our membership of the European Union we have tossed that . advantage away to the point that we don’t know who has come in to the . country. The consequences of that, as in this case, can be incredibly . serious.’ A UK Border Agency spokesman said: . ‘Public protection is our number one priority. We will not accept . foreign criminals breaking UK laws and will seek to deport any European . national who commits a serious offence.’ VIDEO: Ireneusz Bartnowski was caught on CCTV .","Ireneusz Bartnowski battered Italian grandparents with claw hammer .

"By . Chris Brooke . Last updated at 7:10 AM on 17th February 2012 . Defiant: Former NUM President Arthur Scargill leaves Sheffield County Court where he is claiming £50,000 in damages against the organisation . In his heyday, Arthur Scargill ruled the National Union of Mineworkers like a king. But yesterday the 74-year-old turned against his former kingdom by taking the union to court in a battle over thousands of pounds in unpaid bills and benefits. Mr Scargill is claiming up to £50,000 damages in a case that could cost the union’s Yorkshire Trust Fund as much as £80,000 if he wins. And it was clear from a typically combative performance in the witness box at Sheffield County Court that time has not changed the former union firebrand in his determination to fight to the end for his ‘rights’. Mr Scargill, who ended his reign as union President 10 years ago, claims the union should pay all his home and mobile phone bills as well as £14,556 towards the cost of a new car. He has hired a leading QC and is also asking for his costs to be paid by the union. But as it was in the famous miners dispute of the 1980s, the two sides remain miles apart, with his union employers offering to pay their former leader just £50 for a car. After resigning as NUM President in 2002, Mr Scargill became a paid employee of the Yorkshire Area Trust Fund in a contract which ended in December 2011. The court battle centres on the terms of this lower grade job and work he did or didn’t do. Giving evidence in a dark suit and red tie, Mr Scargill implied he received a £26,000-a-year salary for the trust job and worked more than eight hours a day for six days a week on important compensation and legal casework on behalf of members. Combative: Mr Scargill (centre) leads protesters through Mansfield at the height of the miners' strike in 1984 . He said: ‘Most people who know me say I undertook more hours than any other official in history.’ However, the court heard two of the trustees were unaware he was working for the fund and for months at a time Mr Scargill was said to do no work at all. Bizarrely, the terms and conditions of his employment as a union trust fund official were set out in writing when Mr Scargill was still union President. James Laddie, for the trust fund, suggested to Mr Scargill the important document was a ‘letter to you and from you.’ Mr Scargill denied authorising his own job terms and insisted: ‘It would have been a conflict of interest for me to do my own contract of employment.’ He said the task was handed to the vice-president and union solicitors instead. Industrial action: Arthur Scargill (centre) addresses the media during the coal miners' strike of 1992 in protest at Government plans to close 40 per cent of Britain's mines . Discussing his workload as a trust official, the court heard there were 58 ‘cases or issues’ he handled in a three-year period from June 2007. However, some of these jobs detailed in a written log by Mr Scargill involved little work. One task he listed as a union job involved him signing five books, the court heard. There was a four-month period in 2008 when he did no work at all, according to the list. Mr Laddie told the claimant: ‘There were large periods of time when you undertook no work at all on behalf of the Yorkshire Area Trust Fund.’ From 2004 onwards, he never attended a single trust meeting and the minutes of the meetings never discussed any of the work he had done, the court heard. Mr Laddie told him: ‘If you really were conducting any of this terribly important and terribly substantial work in the course of your employment, it’s surprising there is no reference to that work over this period of years.’ However, the former union leader, who was earning £70,000 a year as President, denied any suggestion that he had a small workload. He insisted he was entitled to a car allowance from the union in intervals of not less than two years. The county court case being heard by Judge Robert Moore is just the first stage in an ongoing legal battle with the NUM. Mr Scargill is in dispute over the payment of £34,000 annual rent on a £1.5 million apartment in London’s upmarket Barbican development, which the former leader claims he is guaranteed for life. Another court hearing is also due to take place in London later this year over other union benefits allegedly owed to Mr Scargill, including the cost of an alarm at his home in Barnsley, accountancy fees and his fuel allowance. It was clear that Mr Scargill has lost none of his belligerence and repeatedly stood his ground in the face of questioning by the trust fund’s barrister. An exasperated Mr Laddie said to him during the middle of one question and answer session: ‘You telling me I have answered the question is not actually the same as answering the question.’ The case continues.","Former NUM President wants bills and benefits paid .

But that didn't stop Lauren Alaina’s nerves getting the better of her as she fluffed singing the National Anthem at a Thanksgiving Day football game. She paused for three seconds in the middle of the song before completing it with a broad grin - and cheeks blazing red with with embarrassment. Scroll down for video . American Idol? Lauren Alaina sings the national anthem before an NFL game between the Detroit Lions and the Green Bay Packers in Detroit on Thursday . Her blunder sparked a Twitter frenzy and drew comparisons to Christina Aguilera, who famously bungled the National Anthem during the opening to the last Superbowl. Speaking afterwards Alaina apologised and said that she was only human. She also said that, unlike during her appearance on the American Idol tour, at least she did not tumble down the stairs and hurt herself. She Tweeted: ‘I'm not a robot. I have no excuses. I messed up. You know, what can ya do. At Least (I) didn’t fall down again. ‘Thank you everyone for the kind words. But the truth is I messed up. I’m gonna spend the rest of the day being thankful for all my blessings.’ Her blunder came during the opening of the Detroit Lions v Green Bay Packers game in Detroit on Thursday. Patriotic: Her blunder came during the opening of the Detroit Lions vs. Green Bay Packers game in Detroit on Thursday .

Aguilera’s blunder was far worse, and happened in front of a worldwide audience of more than 100million who had tuned in to watch the last Superbowl. The pop star accidentally repeated most of the second line of the National Anthem in place of the fourth. It later emerged that she had cribbed the lyrics from Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia which can be edited by any member of the public. After realising her error Aguilera, 30, issued a humbling apology and said: 'I got so lost in the moment of the song that I lost my place. 'I can only hope that everyone could feel my love for this country and the true spirit of it's anthem still came through.'

A cyclist who was rammed off the road by a bus driver who used his vehicle ‘like a weapon’ says he feels ‘no anger’ towards him. Father-of-two Phillip Mead, 43, was flung over his handlebars and catapulted 10ft across the road after reckless driver Gavin Hill, 29, swerved into him following a road rage bust-up at a roundabout in Bristol. Mr Mead suffered a broken leg and fractured wrist and as he lay on the ground in agony, the driver simply straightened up the single decker bus and continued on the journey. But Mr Mead says far from feeling anger towards the driver, he actually feels sorry for him. The computer programmer from St Anne’s, Bristol, said: ‘It just seemed to me that it was a complete moment of madness from him. ‘It goes to show how one bit of rage can affect so many people’s lives. It has affected me and my family - but also now him and his family now he has gone to prison. ‘He was angry and he let the anger get the better of him. But I do not feel any anger towards him now - in fact I feel really sorry for his family. ‘But that couple of seconds where he lost it he has affected a lot of people for a long time.' Sobbing Hill was jailed for 17 months at Bristol Crown Court yesterday after pleading guilty to dangerous driving and causing grievous bodily harm. A bus driver for ten years, Hill described the incident as a 'moment of madness'. In a CCTV clip shown to the court, the . cyclist is shown riding in front of the Bugler Coaches vehicle before . the bus pulls out to overtake him. Captured on CCTV, bus driver Gavin Hill swerves to the right of the cyclist Phillip Mead as if to overtake him in Bristol city centre . Impact: The bus driver cuts back in sharply and collides with the cyclist who is seen in this picture going flying over the handlebars . But the bus then suddenly swerves to the left - knocking into Mr Mead and sending him sprawling across the road. The cyclist said: ‘I saw the bus come alongside me, then swerve straight into me. I was thinking ‘what the hell is he doing?’. ‘As the bus came into me it touched my shoulder and over I went. My bike went off to the left and I rolled over the top of it. Mr Mead tumbles onto the ground in a heap as the bus towers menacingly over him. He suffered a broken leg and fractured wrist in the road rage ramming . Mr Mead lies on the ground in pain after the attack but as can be seen from the CCTV the bus driver straightens up the vehicle and continues towards the traffic lights . Guilty: Gavin Hill entering Bristol Crown Court yesterday . ‘I remember being on the ground and . trying to get up - but I felt pain in my left leg. I slumped back down . on the ground and a group of people rushed over to help me. ‘I could feel my left wrist expanding - . so I was pretty sure I had broken that. I was in pain - but I was . probably more worried about my bike.’ Mr Mead spent two weeks in hospital and had grueling operations to repair his left knee and wrist following the incident. He spent six weeks in plaster and was not allowed to cycle for four months but is now back on his bike and commuting to work. Doctors inserted a 25cm metal plate in his left leg and bolted the bones in his left wrist together. He said: 'I was desperate to get back on the bike - cycling is a passion I have had since I was 15. I was a member of the Severn Road Club and we used to cycle for miles. 'The first time I got back on the road . after the crash it was a little bit nerve-wracking. I was looking over . my shoulder a bit more than usual. ‘But I am back cycling to work again now. ‘It happened almost a year to the day . after I was given the all-clear for testicular cancer - so it has been a . hell of a couple of years. ‘But without my helmet it could have been a lot worse - I could have been killed.’ Wife Samantha, an office manager for an accountancy firm in Bristol, said: 'I make him text me every morning to say he has got to work safely now. 'I cannot relax until he has done it. But Phillip has not let this get him down at all - he has just got on with things. 'I still cannot believe somebody could do something like this to a cyclist.' Hill was told he would serve half his . sentence before being considered for release on licence, but he was . sacked by Bugler Coaches following the incident. Judge Mark Horton said his action 'was . not an accident' and added: 'You used the bus as a weapon to bully and . intimidate Mr Mead.' The shamed driver, from Frome, . Somerset, tearfully mouthed ‘I love you’ to his sobbing family in the . public gallery as he was taken down to the cells. Gerald Creed, managing director of . Bugler Coaches, said: 'We were deeply shocked when we heard of this . incident and once we had established what had happened Mr Hill was . immediately dismissed as we did not want him driving one of our buses . ever again.'","Gavin Hill swerved the bus into cyclist after traffic argument at roundabout .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:13 AM on 20th February 2012 . If he's after some gruelling competition, he's in the right job. But a bit of a fight never put off . presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who followed his high school . sweetheart to her Mormon university after discovering she was dating . campus's most eligible man. The battle - which Romney won, . eventually claiming the sweetheart as his bride - is described by the . Washington Post in an article documenting Romney's conservative life at Brigham Young University. Speaking to his college friends and teachers, it reveals how he shunned protests against the church's ban on black priests and how he was despised as a wealthy teacher's pet by other students. Sweethearts: Mitt Romney and Ann Davies, pictured after their wedding in 1969, were informally engaged before he moved to France for missionary work. She began dating a fellow student in Utah . When Ann Davies enrolled at Brigham . Young in 1967, Romney had already completed his first year at Stanford . and had began missionary work in France. Ann, who was a few years below Romney at school, had known her sweetheart since they were young and he had informally asked her to marry him at his senior prom in 1965. Romney's father, then the Michigan . governor, had baptized Ann and her brother into Mormonism, and she saw Mitt in France - under strict supervision - when she studied there for a . semester. Months later, . after Ann had returned to her studies in Provo, Utah, Romney was involved in a . car crash that left him and a friend hospitalised, and killed another. Standing by her man: Ann and Mitt Romney during his bid for Republican presidential candidate . As he recovered from head injuries and a . fractured arm, he received a letter from Ann that she had started dating . Kim S. Cameron, a student body vice president who would be voted the . school's 'most preferred man', the Washington Post reported. Popular: Ann wrote to Mitt to say she had developed feelings for Kim S. Cameron, pictured recently . Cameron, who treated Ann to movies and dance shows, told the paper: 'We liked each other.' In an interview with the National Enquirer this week, Cameron added: 'When I started dating Ann, she never mentioned anything about a pact with Mitt that they were going to get married. 'When he returned, I knew that she would end up with him.' He is also quoted in biography The Real . Romney as saying it is 'probably right' that he thought for a while he . might marry Ann, adding, 'emotionally, I felt very close to her'. He admitted to the Post that, although the son of the country's most famous Mormon politician was abroad, he still had the upper hand. 'If you have a choice to pick either . Mitt Romney or Kim Cameron, who are you going to pick? I mean, 99 out of . 100, no contest,' Cameron, who went on to marry another BYU student, said. 'Near . tears' in France, Romney wrote Ann letters begging to rekindle their . relationship. She responded that he should join her at the Utah . university and he agreed he would go for a semester. Romney studied at the university for two years, completing his studies. His . father later said: 'Now he is just like the rest of you brain-washed . students - he thinks BYU is the best university in the country.' Winning her back: Romney wrote Ann letters begging for a reconciliation and she said he should move to Utah . Back together: The couple married in 1969 and Romney stayed at Brigham Young University for his studies . And Romney won what he had moved . there for, marrying Ann shortly after in 1969. They went on to have five . sons - the first, Tagg, in 1970 while they were still . undergraduates. While . at the university, he became heavily involved on campus, and proved a . prolific fundraiser for the Cougar Club athletics programme, of which he . was president. But Romney, dubbed a 'straight shooter' by his peers, turned his back on rallies against the Vietnam war and the church's conservative rules, staying away from a protest on the ban on black priests. Aside from his friends and admirers, there was a handful of students who did not think much of the straight-A English literature student from good Mormon pedigree. Top student: Mitt Romney, pictured speaking at Brigham Young University in 1971, stayed away from student rallies on campus and was regarded as a teacher's pet, according to classmates . Brood: The couple went on to have five children, (L-R) Tagg, Ben, Matt, Craig and Josh . When Romney returned to the . university in 1997 to give a lecture, his former classmate Kristine . Hansen presented Romney with membership to the school's Phi Kappa Phi . society of academic achievers, the Post reported. He received the honor and joked he had declined an offer to join during his student days 'because it cost money'. Hansen, who had not been able to join as a student because she could not afford the cost, told the Post: 'I thought, ""You could have paid that"". To me, it wasn't that funny.' In another anecdote that appears to highlight Romney's attitude towards finances, one staff member told the Post that Romney had approached him about applying for an English PhD. Marshall Craig responded: 'You can . afford to read all the books you'd like, but why would you get a PhD and . starve?' Instead he suggested: 'You should get an MBA' - which Romney . did. Conservative: The Romneys attended the Mormon-run Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah . While a student at BYU, Romney garnered . good relationships with teachers and would greet them in the halls - . much to the annoyance of some of his classmates who saw him a teacher's . pet. One former student, Terrell Hunt, took a philosophy class with Romney - but received a poor mark for an 100-page final paper. Hunt wrote a letter to the teacher asking: 'Is the analysis on comments you made on my paper typical to the comments you made on other students in the class? In fact, I'd like to see your comments on Mitt Romney's paper.' The philosophy teacher C. Terry Warner, recalled the student as 'full of himself'. Romney and his new wife - and their ever-expanding brood - stayed in Utah until he began his MBA at Harvard in 1971.

"Katey Wall was subjected to a brutal and unprovoked ten minute assault from her attacker Matthew Atkins . The 24-year-old pretended to stop breathing in a desperate bid to stop the onslaught . She is now too scared to go out at alone in the dark and suffered nightmares for months . By . David Baker . Last updated at 10:09 AM on 20th February 2012 . A nursery nurse has revealed how she was forced to play dead during a terrifying assault which left her with such shocking injuries her own mother did not recognise her. Katey Wall thought she was going to die as Matthew Atkins, 25, punched her repeatedly in the head during a brutal assault in the earlier hours of the morning on a dark footpath in Bridgnorth, Shropshire. And the attractive 24-year-old says even though she pretended to stop breathing, in an attempt to stop the attack, the random assault only ended after a passer-by further down the path spooked Atkins. Brutal: Miss Wall was unrecognisable to her own mother after she was brutally attacked (right) but is now on the road to recovery following  the unprovoked 10 minute onslaught from Matthew Atkins . The horrific assault, on July 30 last year, left the blonde bleeding so heavily that her own mother didn’t recognise her when she got out of the ambulance - and those on the scene after the onslaught said the footpath looked like someone had been stabbed. Speaking about the horrendous ordeal, which lasted a staggering 10 minutes, Katey said 'I wasn’t aware anyone was following me. I heard a couple of footsteps and someone put their hand over my mouth from behind but I thought it was someone I knew having a laugh. 'When I turned around I realised I didn’t know him and he kept his hand over my mouth and was pinching my nose. 'It was a struggle at first, I was throwing my arms everywhere and screaming but he had his hand over my mouth. It felt like quite a few minutes before I went to the floor. 'I was face down and he was using my hair to bash my head on the floor really hard. I thought that was it, I thought I was going to die. Thug: Matthew Atkins arrives at Shrewsbury Crown Court where he admitted to unlawfully and maliciously wounding Katey Wall with intent to do her grievous bodily harm, following the hearing he was remanded in custody . 'So I thought maybe if I play dead and stop breathing, he might go away. He was listening for my breathing and eventually I let out a gasp, and he kept on banging my head off the floor.' Luckily for the nursery nurse, Atkins ran off when he heard footsteps further up the popular pathway - leaving a barely conscious Katey to die. 'Someone came along the path and he must’ve heard them or seen them and ran away,' she added. 'It was 30 seconds before I realised he had gone. I got up and tried to run away but I was nearly unconscious so I kept falling to the floor. 'All I remember is saying ‘I have been attacked’ to someone and luckily just up the road is an ambulance station so they were ready.' Katey was rushed to Princess Royal Hospital, in Telford, where she had nine stitches to wounds on the back of her head. 'Because I had so much banging to the head I had nine stitches to the back of my head and they had to keep me in for 48 hours for observation,' said Katey, who lives at her home with her parents in Bridgnorth. 'My hair was exactly the same colour as it is now but when they opened the ambulance doors my own mum didn’t even recognise me. My hair was completely red. 'There was a lot of blood. It looked like someone had been stabbed there.' Despite describing herself as 'strong', Katey refuses to go out in the dark on her own since the terrifying ordeal - which gave her nightmares for months. And the brave 24-year-old says she believes the only reason Atkins didn’t fatally injure her is because she put up a fight. 'He wasn’t a lot bigger than myself but he was more powerful,' she added. 'I think it went on for ten minutes. My . bag was over my shoulder which would have been easy to take but nothing . was missing from it. Court: Atkins admitted to assaulting Miss Wall at Shrewsbury Crown Court and is expected back at the same court in a couple of weeks for sentencing . 'At the time I only thought that he was trying to kill me. I think because I put up such a fight, he was spooked a bit. 'I was having really bad nightmares and I was scared to go out in the dark. I won’t go out in the dark on my own anymore, it’s changed my life in that way.' Atkins, of Telford, Shropshire admitted unlawfully and maliciously wounding Miss Wall with intent to do her grievous bodily harm at Shrewsbury Crown Court this week. Judge Peter Barrie adjourned the case for reports and further psychiatric evidence until March 13. Atkins was remanded in custody.","Katey Wall was subjected to a brutal and unprovoked ten minute assault from her attacker Matthew Atkins .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:32 AM on 20th February 2012 . Yankees bosses are standing by their scandal hit general manager Brian Cashman as his embarrassing stalking case continues to make headlines. The father-of-two, who is facing a divorce after his alleged stalker claimed they had an affair and he got her pregnant, has also vowed to not let his personal problems 'affect his job'. Speaking at a press conference held at the New York team's training camp in Tampa, Cashman attempted to focus on baseball, reports the New York Post. However, he admitted to reporters that the last few weeks of his life have been 'difficult' but said he  would remain focused on his job even as the details of his struggles at home are aired in public. A sad state of affairs: Looking tired and unhappy, Brian Cashman drives away from his house in Norwalk, Connecticut on Saturday . Louise Neathway, pictured right in court, claimed that Yankess boss . Brian Cashman, left, got her pregnant and made her have an abortion . 'I have a professional life and a . personal life, and I will continue to do the job to the best of my . ability like I always have,' he said, according to the Post. Cashman moved out of the family mansion after Louise Neathway, 36, was charged with stalking and harassing him. The case has revealed a long list of . embarrassing claims from Neathway, who has a history of harassment, who . said she had a lengthy affair with the 44-year-old and he forced her to . have an abortion after she got pregnant. Cashman refused to answer questions on his future with the Yankees . 'Those answers are for somebody else. It's not going to affect my job. Out of respect for others, I don't want to speak for anybody else.' Yankee officials have said that Cashman is '100% totally supported' by the team, reports the Post. Neathway allegedly bombarded Cashman . with emails and even attached an ultrasound scan of their alleged unborn . to one of the messages. The trove of emails sent to Cashman . and his lawyer by Neathway, who claims she had an affair with the . father-of-two and allegedly blackmailed him for $6,000, were obtained by the New York Daily News. Pregnancy scare: Ms Neathway emailed Mr Cashman a photo of an ultrasound, pictured, telling him to pay for her 'abortion' or she would continue to torment him . Prior accusations: Cashman is not the first man to accuse her of stalking and making threats . 'What Brian Cashman has done to me is . both incomprehensible and unforgivable,' Neathway reportedly wrote in an email . sent with the scan on January 29. 'I am going to the press and . informaing [sic] them of the preganacy [sic] and the abortion. And . everything else,' she writes typo littered message, reports the Daily . News. 'So you can have a . little gloat at my agony here is my ultra sound picture. . . I guess its . ok for me to just push this aside right? Men!!!' Neathway, . in a separate email sent a day later, threatened to make Cashman’s life . hell unless he paid for her 'abortion'. She also warned that any . threats against her would backfire claiming she worked for British . intelligence agency MI6. 'I will not tolerate threats by any means, of a criminal nature, as that will bite Brian in the backside and probably will be the biggest personal mistake of his life,' wrote the mother-of-one, reports the Daily News. His wife Mary, 42, filed for divorce a . day after Neathway faced her charges in court earlier this month claiming to have had an . affair with the father-of-two. Cashman is the latest in a line of men . who claim Neathway has tormented them with death threats, phone hacking . and lies about miscarriages and abortions, court records and former . friends claim, according to the Post. Yankees boss Brian Cashman's wife has filed for a divorce after he was publicly accused of the affair with Neathway . He emerged in public last Saturday for the first time since his wife submitted the divorce papers after the humiliating claims he had an affair with his accused 'crazed stalker'. Scruffily dressed, he visited the . family’s $3.7 million Darien mansion where his wife has been living . apart in the wake of the allegations - but he spent less than a minute . inside, reports the New York Post. Mrs Cashman had said the marriage had 'broken down irretrievably'. She is seeking permanent alimony, half of their property and joint custody of their two children, reports the New York Post. Extra threat: Neathway warned Cashman in her last email that any threats against her would backfire claiming she worked for British intelligence agency MI6 . Mrs Cashman, who endured the humiliation of an affair her husband had back in 2009, has been living apart from him in the family home with her daughter and son, sources told the Post. British native Neathway, also known as Louise Meanwell, was arrested on Wednesday and is facing charges of grand larceny, stalking and harassment. On Thursday prosecutors said Neathway harassed Cashman with hundreds of text messages, and demanded he give her $15,000 to pay for an unspecified medical procedure. She allegedly threatened to contact the press and his family with claims that would hurt his personal relationships and professional standing, according to a court complaint. Cashman made two payments, one for $4,000 and another for $2,000. In a series of shocking emails to Cashman, Louise Neathway, 36, pictured in court on Thursday, reportedly threatened to tell the world he got her pregnant . He even tried to get rid of his alleged mistress by urging her mother to have her committed, sources told the Daily News. He contacted Caroline Meanwell last week and told her that her daughter was mentally unstable and 'needs help', the sources said. The call led to a meeting between Meanwell, Cashman and his lawyer. 'He told the mother she needed help,' one of the sources told the Daily News. 'He suggested to her that she try to have her committed' In a meeting on January 27, Cashman and Meanwell placed a conference call to Louise’s Manhattan psychiatrist, Charlotte Murphy, who agreed with Cashman, sources told the Post said. 'Murphy agreed that Louise was dangerous and violent, and that it was a serious situation. She said to call 911,' a  source told the Post. Second sting: Cashman's wife has since filed for divorce requesting joint custody of their two children and share in their $3.7 million Darien mansion with this latest sting being his second affair during their marriage . Meanwell made the call which eventually led to her daughter's arrest. The Daily News also obtained a reference letter Cashman wrote for Neathway on Yankees letterhead. In . the letter dated July 15, 2011, Cashman said that he has known her for . six years through charity work and describes her as 'tireless' contributor who has the 'respect and admiration' of her colleagues. In court Neathway's lawyers said Mr Cashman was 'a . married man having an inappropriate relationship' with Neathway, a . medical sales worker, and he . turned on her when it 'ended badly' Neathway’s lawyers claim their client is the real victim of a romance that . began in April and 'ended badly.' She . is also reported by the Post to have claimed to several friends that . she had a year long affair with Cashman which she ended after he did not . fulfill a promise to leave his wife. Mr Cashman claims he was stalked and blackmailed into handing over $6,000 to Louise Neathway . Neathway has a criminal history of harassment and trespassing going back to 1988 and spanning three states. She has allegedly been harassing her ex-husband Jason Bump, their daughter and a long line of boyfriends she’s had since her marriage broke up, reports the Post. 'She’s a very dangerous person. She’s a psychopath, in my estimation,' Mr Bump, told The Post. 'There’s currently an order of protection for myself, my daughter, my wife and my mother' against her. 'She has not seen our daughter in a few years, and she’s not allowed to contact her at all,' he said reports the Post. Cashman is the latest in a line of men who claim Neathway has tormented them with death threats, phone hacking and lies about miscarriages and abortions, court records and former friends claim, according to the Post. In 2010 a former lover, who works on Wall Street, told the police that 'she has made many threatening statements aimed at me and has been e-mailing and phoning me constantly. Cashman is the latest in the line of men who claim Neathway has tormented them with death threats, phone hacking and lies about miscarriages . 'She’s also begun waiting outside my apartment in the East Village,' court records said according to the Post. 'I am fearful for my safety and have no idea what this woman is capable of. As of this morning, she has hacked into my personal e-mail account and my Facebook account, deleting all my e-mails. I am VERY scared of her.' he ex-fling said. Neathway also has two open upstate warrants for harassment, and is on probation for stalking in New Jersey, reports the Daily News. Mrs Cashman served her husband with divorce papers on January 31, the day before Neathway was arrested, reports the Post. The documents were filed in court on Friday. She previously stood by her husband as he was romantically linked to a Westchester mother-of-two, Kim Brennan. A spokesman for Brian Cashman declined a request from the Post to comment on the divorce filing.","Accused stalker Louise Neathway claims to have had an affair with Cashman and says he got her pregnant .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 6:02 AM on 19th February 2012 . In the dock: George Huguely V is escorted by a sheriff's deputy as he arrives for his trial . A former University of Virginia lacrosse player accused of murdering his girlfriend wrote a letter to her shortly before she died saying that he could not control his behaviour and apologising for choking her, a prosecution lawyer said yesterday. During closing arguments in the murder trial of George Huguely V, a prosecutor said investigators found the letter from Huguely to Yeardley Love when they arrived at the scene where she was found dead in May 2010 from blunt force trauma to the head. 'I cannot control the way I behave,' Huguely, 24, was quoted by prosecutor Dave Chapman as saying in the letter written in February 2010. 'Alcohol is ruining my life.' Mr Chapman said that Huguely did not keep his vow in the letter to never hurt Miss Love again. The letter had been mentioned earlier in the trial but exact quotes were read to the jury for the first time during the final arguments. The prosecutor said a drunk Huguely walked into the 22-year-old's apartment while she was asleep, kicked in her bedroom door and slammed her head against the wall. 'He left her face down on her bed with her arms at her side, palms face up,' said Mr Chapman, who wept as he delivered his closing statement. Prosecution expert witnesses have said Miss Love, from Cockeysville, Maryland, died about two hours later from blunt force trauma to the head. The trial has attracted national media attention to the quiet college town of Charlottesville, Virginia. Jurors are scheduled to begin deliberating on Wednesday, the next available court date. Lovers: Yeardley Love and George Huguely, both students at the University of Virginia, had an on-off relationship . Wrapping up: Yesterday saw the closing statements in Huguely's trial . Huguely, of Chevy Chase, Maryland, . has pleaded not guilty to charges including first-degree murder, . robbery, burglary at night, breaking and entering, grand larceny and . murder during a robbery. In closing arguments, Defence . Attorney Francis Lawrence said the prosecution team has been . 'over-zealous' in charging Huguely with first-degree murder. 'Where's the intent to kill?' Mr Lawrence asked jurors. The defence lawyer acknowledged that . Huguely 'played a role' in Miss Love's death and was intoxicated, loud . and clumsy the night of her death but had no intention of killing her. Mr Lawrence said Huguely's reaction . to police, who arrested and interrogated him the morning following Miss . Love's death, showed that Huguely was 'a young man who has no clue' that . she had died. He described the student as a 'stupid drunk' who lived in a 'lacrosse ghetto' which led to a lack of perspective. Huguely told police that Miss Love . bloodied herself by banging her own head against the wall. Both were . lacrosse players for Virginia's nationally-ranked lacrosse teams. Accused: Mr Huguely has been charged with first-degree murder following Ms Love's death . On Friday, the jury heard that Huguely and Miss Love were holding hands in a bar just 24 hours before she died. Huguely's aunt and godmother, Alina . Massaro, testified that the pair were holding hands the night of . Saturday, May 1, roughly 24 hours before Huguely confronted Miss Love. The court were played a video recording of the hand-holding which was taken from a bar surveillance tape. Mrs Massaro explained to the jury: 'There's Georgie, and now that's Yeardley, and they're holding hands.' The recording was not visible to the court gallery. She . said the family went out to a bar after her nephew's lacrosse game . where they ran into Miss Love. On the tape, she can be seen hugging his . relatives and his aunt said things between the two students were cordial . and friendly. Lacrosse: The pair were both enthusiastic sports players and were friends with the rest of the lacrosse team . The day before, the 24-year-old was . accused of lying about visiting his friends on the night she died. Former teammate Ken Clausen testified on Wednesday, the day the . prosecution rested and defence began. The defense began its presentation . with a medical expert who said he believed Ms Love was asphyxiated from . lying face down in a damp, bloody pillow. The testimony did not state . how she came to be in that position. While . Huguely acknowledged in a police interrogation that his final . encounter with Ms Love turned physical, he said he did not believe her . injuries were serious. His . attorneys have argued that her death was accidental, possibly the result . of drinking and a prescription drug she took for attention-deficit . disorder. A coroner has said those substances were in her body but not . in potentially lethal doses. Most of the prosecution witnesses on Wednesday were former lacrosse players, many of whom knew Ms Love. The . day before her body was found, Huguely was seen drunk during an . end-of-season father-son golf tournament and dinner, his teammates said, . describing his slurred speech and public urination. Later that night, he and other friends went to Huguely's apartment for beers and to watch TV. About . 20 minutes before midnight, they decided to go to a nearby store to . pick up some more beer while Huguely remained in the apartment, the . teammates said. They came back with the beer 15 or 20 minutes later, and . Huguely was not in the apartment but soon returned. He . told his friends he had gone to visit two other teammates in his . apartment building. One of the teammates, however, had stayed in his own . apartment and was not in Huguely's building. On trial: Mr Huguely acted strangely on the night of the killing, the court has heard . Asked by Mr Chapman about Huguely's demeanour, the witness said: 'He had this blank stare on his face.' Mr Clausen said he repeatedly asked Huguely what was bothering him, but 'got no response'. He said of Huguely's mood after he returned from the beer run, 'There was no doubt in my mind there was a change in his demeanour.' Mr Carroll testified, however, that he detected no difference in Huguely's mood. 'I just thought he was really, really drunk,' he said. Huguely told the two witnesses he went to visit fellow players Chris Clements and Will Bolton downstairs in Mr Clements' apartment. Mr Bolton testified, however, that he was not with Mr Clements and was at his own apartment. Prosecutors have placed Huguely's visit to Ms Love's nearby apartment at approximately midnight. Her body was found about two hours later. In a police interrogation interview hours after Ms Love's death, Huguely told a detective that he 'shook her a little' but did not hit her in the face. He said she hit her own head against the wall and that he did not think she was seriously hurt when he left. Huguely said he had gone to his ex-girlfriend's apartment 'just to talk'. When she refused to let him in, he kicked through the door. The trial continues.","Prosecutor weeps as he claims George Huguely murdered Yeardley Love .

"By . Kimberley Dadds . Last updated at 11:24 AM on 20th February 2012 . Kimberley Walsh has become accustomed to dressing in an unflattering green outfit while playing an ogre on stage, while Kara Tointon's currently dressing in drab clothes for her turn in the theatre. So no wonder the pair took the opportunity to dress to the nines at the Whatsonstage.com theatre awards on Sunday night. The singer and actress led the stylish ladies gracing the red carpet as they entered the glitzy event. Stunners: Stars of the theatre Kimberley Walsh and Kara Tointon drew attention in their stunning dresses as they turned up to the Whatsonstage.com awards on Sunday night . Girls Aloud singer Kimberley, who currently plays Princess Fiona in Shrek: The Musical, was a lady in red for the night as she donned a scarlet frock. The strapless dress with a heart shaped bust flattered her figure and showed off her tanned skin. Matching the outfit with beige heels with bow detailing and a cute clutch, the singer sparkled as she joined in the festivities. Ditching the ogre clothes: Girls Aloud singer Kimberley swapped her green Princess Fiona outfit for musical Shrek for traffic-stopping red . And Kara looked just as ravishing as she styled herself especially for the awards show at the Prince of Wales theatre in London. The actress can currently be seen in Absent Friends, in which she has to dress in dowdy clothing and unflattering hairstyles every night. But on Sunday she was immaculate in an intricate silver gown which showed off her tiny frame with the off-shoulder cut. The dress, which was embellished with flowers and lace, was teamed with strappy heels. Striking a pose: The stage queen dressed to . impress in pencil skirt with a sheer top as she was also joined by Jenny . Eclair for hosting duties . And she tied her new hair-do up into a high bun, showing off her new fringe style, which was brushed forward. The former EastEnders star had only debuted the choppy new look earlier this week as she enjoyed the Jasper Conran catwalk show during London Fashion Week. Stage queen Sheridan Smith was also dressed to the max for the awards in her little black number. The former blonde looked ravishing with her red hair tied back, showing off the pencil skirt with sheer top. It was a sophisticated look for the star, who posed with comedian Alan Davies, who also looked dapper in his suit and tie. Hosts: Sheridan Smith and comedian Alan Davies presented the awards show at London's Prince of Wales Theatre . Sheridan hosted the event alongside Alan and Jenny Eclair, writing on Twitter before the show: 'Backstage at @Whatsonstage awards with @alandavies1 & @jennyeclair about to go on.Make some noise plse audience,let's make it a good one! :D' Throughout the night prizes were handed out to stars including Amanda Holden, who won Best Actress in a Musical for her role in Shrek: The Musical before Kimberley took over.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:59 AM on 20th February 2012 . A registered New York sex offender kidnapped his estranged girlfriend at gunpoint in Ohio along with her one-year-old she was pushing in a stroller. Thomas Lorde, Latasha Jackson, and her infant daughter Chaniya Wynn were found shot to death hours later in an apparent murder-suicide. Cleveland police said the couple had dated for about two months and that Jackson, 19, was trying to end the relationship. Tragic end: Latasha Jackson, left, and her 13-month-old daughter Chaniya Wynn, centre, were found dead in a Cleveland garage next to the body of Jackson's estranged boyfriend Thomas Lorde, right . Grisly scene: The three were found in this detached two-car garage 12 hours after police began their search . Jackson and Chaniya Wynn were walking with Jackson's 14-year-old brother around noon Saturday when they encountered 35-year-old Lorde, according to police. The teen told police that Lorde pulled out a gun and ordered him to walk away, saying he was going to kill Jackson and take the child. Their bodies were found early Sunday in a closed garage of an unoccupied building behind the now-closed Rendezvous Club, the Cleveland Plain Dealer reported. It appeared that Lorde shot himself in the head after shooting the two females. Police recovered a 9mm bullet from Lorde's car, according to the Plain Dealer. Last seen: Latasha and her daughter were last seen at 72nd St and Union Avenue in Cleveland yesterday afternoon . Last known address: Lorde was said to be living at this house on E. 65th St in Cleveland . Hours after the bodies were discovered, someone spray painted the words: ‘Rest in Peace Latasha & Chaniya. We love u. 2012' on the garage. Mourners also laid flower bouquets along the door. Community activist Khalid Samad told the Plain Dealer that a candlelight vigil will be held Tuesday night for the young mother and daughter. Chaniya’s 28-year-old father told police that Lorde had threatened to kidnap Jackson and kill her daughter, but refused to speak with reporters. The Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner’s Office will determine the causes of death. Lorde was described as a violent sexual predator with outstanding felony warrants in New York in an Amber Alert for Jackson and her daughter. He was from the Bronx and was convicted in 1996 for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl at knife-point, the Plain Dealer said. A phone number for his last known address, in Cleveland, could not be found. Telephone messages seeking comment from family members of Jackson and Wynn were not immediately returned.","Thomas Lorde and Latasha Jackson had been dating for two months but Jackson was trying to end things .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 7:04 AM on 19th February 2012 . Serial killer Wesley Shermantine has claimed that he knows of even more sites where the bodies of murder victims were buried in an extraordinary letter to a California television station. Shermantine, one of the so-called 'Speed Freak Killers', told CBS-13 that two burial sites used by his accomplice Loren Herzog have not yet been discovered. The letter, sent from Death Row, also contained a lengthy complaint about Shermantine's media portrayal and about the behaviour of his sister - and it ends, 'Have a nice day.' Letter: Wesley Shermantine sent a bizarre message to a California television station this week . The bizarre letter was sent to the station's Koula Gianulias at the end of a week when a search team found 1,000 bone fragments at a site previously named by Shermantine as the location of some of his and Herzog's victims. He said the reason he had not revealed the other two sites was because he hasn't been paid $33,000 promised by bounty hunter Leonard Padilla. Mr Padilla, who recognised Shermantine's handwriting in the letter, says he's working to establish a trust account before paying. Shermantine began the letter by claiming that reports about him in the media were '90% lies', and repeating the assertion that Herzog, not Shermantine, was responsible for the deaths of up to 20 murder victims. He then complained that he had been taken to hospital following a warning from his sister Barbara Jackson that he could be suicidal - Shermantine said: 'Her concern is about 13 years too late.' The letter concluded: 'If you want to tell the truthful story you've got to offer me something. I've learned nothing's free any more in capitalism [sic] America,' with an invitation for Ms Gianulias to visit him in San Quentin prison. Grim work: San Joaquin Sheriff detectives Paul Hoskins, left, and Lindsay Smith sift for human remains that were excavated from an abandoned cattle ranch near Linden, California . Meticulous: Department of Justice personnel take a record of the human remains found in the well after Wesley Shermantine, motivated by a bounty hunter's promise to pay, lead investigators to burial sites . Wesley Shermantine (left)  and Loren Herzog were dubbed the 'Speed Freak Killers' after their 1999 arrest for a methamphetamine-fueled killing spree - Herzog hanged himself last month after finding out Shermantine was going to reveal the location of their burial sites . All week crews have been sifting through mounds of dirt after information was provided by Shermantine revealing the location of his long-lost victims. Investigators have expanded the search after . authorities determined they have probably come to the bottom of the first . well on the ranch about 12 miles outside of Stockton, San Joaquin . Sheriff's Department spokesman Les Garcia said on Wednesday. Officials said about 1,000 bone fragments were found buried on Calaveras County property once owned by Shermantine's family. Mr Garcia could not provide any new numbers on how many bones or possible victims have been found. The first well, which was filled in by the owner in the mid to late 1980s, is being cleared so that a camera could be lowered into it. Cadaver dogs from Santa Clara County will be brought in today to detect if there are human remains left in the dirt cleared out, Mr Garcia said. Close detail: Crews spent days searching the ranch in Linden, at what San Joaquin Sheriff's Department spokesman said was a ¿slow and tedious¿ pace . Victims: The bodies of Cyndi Vanderheiden, left and Chevelle Wheeler, right, were found buried in California in the area identified by Shermantine . Missing: Michaela Garecht, nine, has still not been found since her abduction in November 1988 . The search has already had a significant amount of success, as the bodies of two murder victims were found earlier this week. The . remains of two women- Chevelle 'Chevy' Wheeler disappeared while . skipping school in 1985 aged 16, and Cyndi Vanderheiden, a 25-year-old . last seen in front of her Linden home in 1998- were found during the . search, giving their families some closure. Dental records identified remains found Thursday in Calaveras County as those of 25-year-old Ms Vanderheiden, who disappeared. Another set of remains were found Friday . in the same area, and the parents of the missing 16-year-old girl have . said authorities told them that Shermantine said their daughter was . buried in that spot decades ago. The . new bones and skulls that were discovered along with clothes, a purse . and jewellery leads authorities to believe that there may be 10 or more . victims. Meanwhile, 65 calls have been made to a . hotline set up by authorities for people who believe their loved ones . might be among the victims of Shermantine and Herzog. Shermantine has said many more remains could be found at the well, where digging resumed on Wednesday after being hampered by rain. Earlier this year, Shermantine wrote to a local . paper saying that Herzog was behind the abduction of Michaela Garecht, a 9-year-old was was snatched from the street in 1988. He said that he . would lead police to the spot where the pair used to bury their victims, . but she is still missing. Shermantine is on death row after he was convicted in 2001 of four murders. Investigators said the boyhood friends were suspected in as many as 20 murders as a result of a meth-fueled crime spree. Herzog was convicted of three murders . and sentenced to 77 years to life in prison. Herzog's sentence was . reduced to 14 years after an appeals court tossed out his first-degree . murder convictions because his confession had been illegally obtained. Herzog was paroled in 2010 to a trailer outside the High Desert State . Prison in Susanville. He killed himself in January outside that trailer after learning Shermantine was disclosing the victims' locations. He is making the disclosures after Sacramento bounty hunter Leonard Padilla promised to pay him $33,000. He said he hopes to collect on rewards being offered by the state of California for information about several missing persons suspected of being victims of Herzog and Shermantine.","Location of bones was revealed by Westley Shermantine after a bounty hunter promised to pay him $33,000 .

"By . Luke Salkeld and Chris Greenwood . Last updated at 12:00 AM on 20th February 2012 . The killing of a country vicar has been linked to the murder of a widow following the arrest of a ‘dangerous’ suspect, police said yesterday. The Rev John Suddards was killed in his home six weeks after the body of Betty Yates was discovered at her secluded riverside cottage. Both had been stabbed. A police spokesman confirmed that the murders, which took place about 60 miles apart, had been ‘formally linked’ after Stephen Farrow, 47, was  arrested early yesterday. On Saturday, detectives issued an urgent appeal to help find Farrow, who was described as a ‘dangerous’ suspect who exploits the charity of the church. Drifter: Police have arrested Stephen Farrow, 47, (left) over the murder . of Rev John Suddards (right), after they were led to him at an address . in Folkestone, Kent, by a tip off from the public . They warned the public not to approach him under any circumstances and instead to dial 999.Mr Suddards, 59, was found stabbed to death in St Mary’s vicarage in the market town of Thornbury, South Gloucestershire, last Tuesday. The clergyman had admitted to his congregation that welcoming strangers was a ‘risky’ part of his job. Similarities: Betty Yates was found stabbed to death at her home in Bewdley, Worcestershire, on January 2 . Mrs Yates, 77, was beaten with her own walking stick and stabbed in the neck at her isolated home in Bewdley, Worcestershire on January 2. The retired teacher’s body was found two days later. She had lived in the cottage on the banks of the River Severn for more than 30 years. A spokesman for West Mercia Police said Farrow was being transferred into the custody of officers investigating Mr Suddards’s death following his arrest in Folkestone, Kent. Detective Chief Inspector Neil Jamieson of West Mercia Police, which is investigating the case of Mrs Yates, said: ‘We would like to thank Avon and Somerset Police for their help in our investigation. We have been working with them to examine similarities between the deaths of Betty Yates and the Reverend John Suddards.’ He had said earlier of the Betty Yates investigation: ‘We will continue our unrelenting efforts to bring the offender responsible for this dreadful crime to justice.’ Detective Chief Inspector Simon Crisp of Avon and Somerset Police, who is leading the investigation into Mr Suddards’s murder, praised those who had contributed to Farrow’s arrest. ‘I would like to thank the public and all those who have helped us to find him,’ he said. ‘It was as a direct result of assistance from a member of the public that we were able to locate this man and we would like to express our sincere thanks and gratitude.’ He had said of Farrow earlier in the weekend: ‘His favoured form of transport is the bus although we cannot exclude other types of public transport, or hitchhiking or walking. ‘We know that he would seek shelter in a tent that he has with him or he may purchase. Crucially, he may also seek to exploit the charity of the church community.’ Dawn raid: The house on Black Bull Road where police swooped and arrested Farrow at 4.20am Sunday morning . Police continued their inquiries outside the vicarage where Rev Suddard's body was found . The community of Thornbury has been shattered by the death . Farrow is said to have used a variety of names and travelled extensively across the UK. He was arrested two days  after about 300 people attended a special service in Thornbury to remember Mr Suddards. The former barrister had been at the parish for just seven months, but had worked as a vicar for 22 years. Vicar John Suddards, pictured at a Christening, admitted he was at risk during a sermon because of the type of people he took in . Police attend the scene outside the vicarage next to St Mary's church, where the vicar's body was found by builders . Tragedy: St Mary's Church in Thornbury, Gloucestershire, where Rev Suddards has taken over as vicar last July . The Bishop of Gloucester,  the Right Reverend Michael Perham, paid tribute to a ‘good man and faithful minister’. Farrow’s is a second arrest following the vicar’s death. On the day Mr Suddards’s body was discovered, a 43-year-old man was arrested and questioned before being released on bail. Earlier this month, a man was arrested and questioned by police investigating the murder of Mrs Yates. He was later released on bail. Forensic teams were called in after Mr Suddards was found soon after 10am on Monday . Police search the roadside near the vicarage where Mr Suddards was apparently killed . 'He was much loved': Rev John Suddards previously worked at St Nicolas Church in Witham, Essex . Last month, Mrs Yates’s son and daughter made an emotional appeal for help to bring their mother’s killer to justice. Appearing with her brother David Yates, Hazel Costello said: ‘We are completely bewildered as to who could carry out such a savage attack on our mother. That this should have happened in her home makes this even more difficult to bear.’ Anyone with information about either of the killings should call Avon and Somerset or West Mercia Police on 101.","Reverend John Suddards' death is linked to the murder of Betty Yates, 77 .

"The 'Art Squad' performed live in Pyongyang as women take centre stage . Young synchronized swimmers danced to song 'We Will Defend General Kim Jong Un at the Risk of Our Lives' New leader Kim Jong Un uses event to give new unprecedented access to his dictatorship . By . Martin Robinson . Last updated at 3:44 PM on 17th February 2012 . Meet North Korea's first girl band - although they may have to work on the name and outfits. Decked out in military uniform and close to tears, the fearsome sounding 'Art Squad' played live in capital Pyongyang to celebrate the 70th birthday of former leader Kim Jong il, who died two months ago. Huge memorial celebrations were led by his son and successor Kim Jong Un, who has used this event to give the world's media an unprecedented view of his oppressed nation. Girl power: The Art Squad were at the forefront of North Korea's celebrations of Kim Jong il's birthday . And in particular he gave women a leading role on the day, which included this girl band and the nation's top young synchronized swimmers. A sombre Kim Jong Un wore a dark Mao-style suit and bowed deeply before a large portrait of his smiling father for much of yesterday. Hundreds of senior officials, military leaders and citizens also paid their respects. Outside his palace, a huge crowd of North Korean soldiers lined up in neat rows listened to speeches praising his dynasty. Making a splash: Many young women took part in a mass synchronized swimming show in Pyongyang . Talented: The women performed, as a grand finale, the song 'We Will Defend General Kim Jong Un at the Risk of Our Lives' Later the new leader and other officials watched as goose-stepping soldiers marched by, followed by military jeeps and trucks carrying artillery guns and rocket launchers. Fireworks exploded, military music boomed and people waved artificial pink and red flowers. Kim Jong Il ruled with an iron fist for 17 years, a period that included a famine in the 1990s that killed hundreds of thousands of people and protracted tensions over the nation’s drive to build nuclear weapons. Food shortages persist in North Korea and relations with South Korea are at their lowest point in years. But since Kim’s death two months ago, expressions of mourning and adoration have been common in Pyongyang. Unhappy day: North Korea's new leader Kim Jong Un (R) and Ri Yong Ho, chief of the Korean People's Army applaud while viewing a military parade yesterday . Solemn: Kim Jong Un bows his head as he stands with senior political and military leaders at Kumsusan Memorial Palace - below a huge portrait of his father . After the funeral, Kim Jong Un was named supreme commander of the country’s 1.2 million-member military. State media and officials have praised Kim Jong il as a strong but benevolent leader, while calling Kim Jong Un the unquestioned choice to succeed him in this socialist nation of 24 million. 'We will faithfully uphold the ""military-first"" leadership of our respected supreme commander and comrade with our guns,” military General Staff chief Ri Yong Ho said in a speech yesterday. While troops roared 'Let’s dedicate our lives to protect Kim Jong Un!'. Masses: North Koreans pay respects to their late leader Kim Jong-Il by laying flowers . Outpouring: Huge numbers of North Koreans stood quietly to pay their respects . At Kim Il Sung Square, the main plaza in the capital, North Koreans bowed and laid flowers, including red 'kimjongilia' begonias, at a portrait of Kim Jong Il hanging on the Grand People’s Study House. Among them was Paek Won Chol, who described himself as a “soldier and disciple” of Kim Jong Il. 'I will devote my all for the building of a powerful and prosperous nation' under Kim Jong Un,' Paek said. Yesterday's memorial could serve as closure to North Korea’s mourning ahead of important nuclear talks next week with the United States. Impressive: Fireworks exploded over the heads of North Korean soldiers as they marked their former leaders birthday .

Civil servants working for the Home Office are being baked cupcakes and served tea by the department's permanent secretary in a bid to boost morale. Staff are told they are doing a good job over afternoon tea with Dame Helen Ghosh, who has admitted she even bakes the treats herself - with a little help from Domestic Goddess Nigella Lawson, whose recipe has become her 'speciality'. The tea party rewards the best Home Office team every month, and is part of a drive to boost morale and reconnect senior civil servants to grass roots services, it was reported. She told The Times: 'They come and have tea with me and I make cakes. They love it that senior management cares enough to make some cakes and that they get immediate thanks. 'I do like cooking because it is one of the really creative things I have time to do. 'It is something I learnt as a child. Nigella Lawson's cappuccino cupcakes are my speciality.' As well as rewarding hard work, Dame Helen told The Times that the tea parties were also designed to let people in the department get to know their leaders. She said people liked leaders to be 'visible' and that 'visible leadership was getting out and talking to people'. Senior civil servants will also be ordered to spend time with police officers, walking the beat with them, to gain a greater understanding of life on the front line. Winner: A cupcake recipe from Nigella Lawson (pictured) has become a 'speciality' of Dame Helen's . Home Office officials will also join staff at airport passport controls and also teams working in towns and cities who are tackling gang and drug problems. Senior staff in the department are expected to spend up to five days a year on the front line, Dame Helen added, but the scheme could be extended to include all staff. It is hoped the exercise will give officials the chance to see the impact Government policies have on front line services. Dame Helen, who has herself spent time with immigration officials at Heathrow and has accompanied police on the beat, believes the move will provide a better insight into problems than Whitehall-produced policy papers.","Permanent secretary Dame Helen Ghosh serves tea to high-performing staff .

Retired businessman Christopher Tappin played a farewell round of golf yesterday at his local Kent club where he has been a member for 50 years. Next weekend, he will probably be behind bars in one of America’s toughest institutions, facing ‘the worst of all prison nightmares’. For on Friday, the 65-year-old Kent Golf Society president must report to Heathrow Airport police station where he will surrender to two US marshals who will escort him to Texas to face accusations of selling arms to Iran – a crime that attracts a 35-year prison sentence. Before retiring, Christopher Tappin (pictured with his wife, Elaine) owned a freight shipping company, Brooklands International. US prosecutors accuse him of helping to buy industrial batteries which were being shipped from America to Iran . On his arrival in Houston, he will be strip-searched, handcuffed and manacled before being taken to a detention centre close to the Mexican border. If, as expected, he is refused  bail, he will be transferred to a Texan prison to await trial. Mr Tappin’s case – he was arrested last year on instructions from the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency – has reignited the row over the cross-Atlantic transfer of suspects. Before retiring in 2008, Mr Tappin owned a freight shipping company, Brooklands International. US prosecutors accuse him of helping to buy five industrial batteries which were being shipped from America to Tehran. He claims that he thought they were for use in the car industry, but the Americans say they were a key component of its Hawk Air Defence Missile which were being sold without government permission. Mr Tappin claims he thought the batteries were for use in the car industry, but the Americans say they were a key component of its Hawk Air Defence Missile which were being sold without government permission.

Gary Mulgrew, one of the NatWest Three, who was released in 2010 after pleading guilty to wire fraud in the wake of the Enron scandal, says he fears for Mr Tappin. ‘He’s about to enter into the worst of all nightmares – my heart really bleeds for him.’ Mr Mulgrew served part of his time at the notorious Big Spring prison in Texas. ‘You are in a room with 80 inmates. 'When they lock the doors at 10pm, you are on your own until 7am. The guards aren’t protecting you. I am a 6ft 2in Scotsman – Christopher  Tappin is 65.
