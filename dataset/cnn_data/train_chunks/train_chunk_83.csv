"(CNN) -- Algeria's government declared an end to a nearly two-decade state of emergency Tuesday, its state news agency announced, lifting restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly imposed to combat an Islamist insurgency. The country's Council of Ministers approved the repeal Tuesday, the state-run Algeria Press Service reported. ""The draft ordinance will come into force upon its imminent publication in the Official Journal,"" the council said in a statement carried by the agency. The move comes as Algeria, like other Arab nations, faces a wave of protest that has toppled regimes in Egypt and Tunisia and led to open revolt in against longtime strongman Moammar Gadhafi in neighboring Libya. Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika announced this month that he would soon lift the emergency declaration, first imposed in 1992 and indefinitely renewed in 1993. The emergency declaration was part of a clampdown on Islamist movements during a civil war that left more than 150,000 dead. But critics say the insurgency has long since diminished, and the law remained only to muzzle critics of the government. Bouteflika's National Liberation Front has ruled the country since winning indepdendence from France in 1962, and Bouteflika has been in office since 1999. U.S. analysts say Algeria faces some of the same problems that fueled uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt -- high rates of unemployment and a stagnant economy in particular. Protests over food prices began in January but quickly led to calls for political reform. On Sunday, anti-government protesters chanted, ""The people demand the fall of the regime,"" and clashed with police and pro-government demonstrators, opposition leaders said. The country's long-running clampdown began in 1991 when an Islamist party led early balloting in Algeria's first multiparty parliamentary elections. The military stepped in, canceled the second round of voting and launched a campaign against the Islamists that led to a full-scale insurgency, which effectively ended about a decade later. Human Rights Watch says Algeria's government controls state broadcast outlets and sharply restricts private newspapers, with journalists facing prosecution for criticism of public officials. It says police also harass human rights activists who have campaigned for accountability for people killed or ""forcibly disappeared"" during the insurgency.

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- The Association of Southeast Asian Nations will send observers to the tense Thailand-Cambodia border, where a disputed centuries-old temple is located, the organization said Tuesday. Foreign Ministers and representatives from ASEAN's 10 member nations met in Jakarta Tuesday to discuss the long-standing border conflict. In a statement issued after the meeting, ASEAN says it welcomes ""the invitation by both Cambodia and Thailand (for) observers from Indonesia, current chair of ASEAN, to observe the commitment by both sides to avoid further armed clashes between them."" Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa said in a news conference that the civilian and military observers will be unarmed. The team will be there to assist and support both countries to keep their commitment avoid further clashes. ""It is still their responsibility to maintain the ceasefire,"" he said. Deadly clashes erupted again at the border earlier this month. The disputed area is the site of Preah Vihear, a 900-year-old Hindu temple. In 1962, an international court awarded the temple to Cambodia, but Thailand claims that the area around the temple has not been clearly demarcated. The two countries have been in a stand-off since 2008, when UNESCO granted Preah Vihear World Heritage Status. Since the renewed fighting, ASEAN has sent Natalegawa to meet with leaders of both Thailand and Cambodia to try to ease tensions. The U.N. Security Council has also called for a permanent cease-fire and backed ASEAN's efforts to mediate. On Tuesday, Natalegawa said ASEAN is stepping up to the plate and is ""waging peace aggressively"". He expressed hope they can send off the observers to the border ""sooner rather than later."" He could not say how many observers will be part of the team. He also added Thailand and Cambodia will continue to try resolving the conflict through bilateral talks, although Indonesia will be engaged in the process. The next bilateral meeting is expected be held in Jakarta.","ASEAN will send observers to the Thailand-Cambodia border .

"Washington (CNN) -- Musician James Taylor, historian Bernard Bailyn, novelist Joyce Carol Oates, actress Meryl Streep and pianist Van Cliburn were among a small group of honorees recognized at the White House Wednesday for their contributions to America's arts and humanities. The men and women were selected as the 2010 recipients of the National Medal of Arts and National Humanities Medal. The arts medal, established in 1984, is meant to honor ""outstanding contributions to the excellence, growth, support and availability of the arts,"" according to the National Endowment for the Arts. The humanities medal, created in 1997, ""honors individuals or groups whose work has deepened the nation's understanding of the humanities, broadened our citizens' engagement with the humanities, or helped preserve and expand Americans' access to important resources in the humanities,"" according to the National Endowment for the Humanities. The arts and humanities are what ""make the good times worthwhile,"" Obama said. ""Our strength as a people runs deeper than our military might"" or economic prowess. ""It's also about our values and ideas."" Aside from Cliburn, Streep and Taylor, the group receiving the arts medal included: playwright and critic Robert Brustein; abstract artist Mark di Suvero; poet Donald Hall; the organizers of Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, America's longest-running international dance festival; Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Harper Lee; jazz musician Sonny Rollins, and musician Quincy Jones. In addition to Bailyn and Oates, the group receiving the humanities medal included Library of America founder Daniel Aaron; cultural historian Jacques Barzun; poet and novelist Wendell Berry; Spanish and Latin American literary critic Roberto Gonzalez Echevarria; Stanley Nider Katz, the head of the American Council of Learned Societies; biographer and literary critic Arnold Rampersad; novelist Philip Roth, and historian Gordon Wood.","Obama honors the 2010 recipients of the National Medal of Arts and National Humanities Medal .

"Christchurch, New Zealand (CNN) -- The death toll from the 6.3-magnitude earthquake that struck Christchurch this week has risen to 113, police said Friday morning. More people are feared dead, and more than 200 are still missing, police said. Police Superintendent Dave Cliff told reporters that he had ""grave fears"" for the missing and authorities were having difficulty identifying victims because of the condition of the bodies found. The somber announcement came as authorities carried out more house-to-house searches in a desperate hunt for survivors. The quake struck Tuesday, toppling buildings, buckling streets and ripping the facades of iconic churches, including the Christchurch Cathedral and the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament. A series of aftershocks followed. Officials said they had given up hope of rescuing at least 100 people who were trapped in the Canterbury TV building in downtown Christchurch. Police said they were ""100% certain"" no one in the building was still alive. Authorities fear that trapped occupants in another structure, the Pyne Gould Corp. Building, are also dead. Among those missing were 27 Japanese students, Japan's foreign ministry said. Most of them were students at language schools, and five were on personal study trips. Kento Okuda, a Japanese student who was pulled from the rubble of the Toyoma Foreign Language College, told Japan's Asahi Shimbun newspaper that he was having lunch on the fourth-floor cafeteria when the floor gave way. As he and others lay trapped under debris, the students shouted out to each other to get a count of how many of them were alive, Okuda told the newspaper. Many of their fellow Japanese students did not respond. But there have some rare rays of hope in the rescue efforts. One was Anne Vos who was rescued Wednesday from the rubble of the Pyne Gould building in the central business district, according to Australian and New Zealand media. Vos was able to call family members from her cell phone while covered by rubble. ""A couple of hours ago, I thought I'd had it,"" she told New Zealand network TV3 Tuesday. ""I thought it was 'Goodbye Anne.' "" Like some 430 people who have been admitted to emergency rooms since the quake, Vos was taken to a hospital to recuperate. Southern New Zealand has been hit by a series of quakes since September 4 when a 7.1-magnitude temblor struck the area. There were no deaths from that quake, which struck deeper below ground and farther away from Christchurch. Tuesday's earthquake was part of the ""aftershock sequence"" from the September earthquake, the U.S. Geological Survey said. CNN's Anna Coren contributed to this report.","Police say they have ""grave fears"" for the missing .

"Washington (CNN) -- The House of Representatives passed a bill Tuesday that would extend funding for the federal government by another two weeks -- through March 18 -- while cutting $4 billion from current spending levels. The measure was approved in a 335-91 vote, with Republicans overwhelmingly backing it while Democrats were sharply divided. The Senate plans to vote on the measure on Wednesday. Senators and aides from both parties said they expected it to pass and proceed to President Barack Obama for his signature to prevent a government shutdown after Friday, when the current spending resolution expires at midnight. Also Tuesday, the Senate approved a measure that would halt paychecks for the president and Congress in the event of a government shutdown. It was unclear when the House would take up the measure. While the bill extending government funding for two weeks was expected to clear the Republican-controlled House, some Democrats have indicated a preference for a month-long extension while legislators negotiate a more comprehensive spending plan for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends on September 30. The White House has voiced concern that the passage of a series of short-term funding bills could create a climate of uncertainty and hamper prospects for a stronger economic recovery. President Barack Obama called House Speaker John Boehner before Tuesday's vote to discuss the measure, according to White House Press Secretary Jay Carney. Carney indicated the administration would be willing to back a package cutting up to $8 billion from current spending levels over a period lasting up to five weeks.  The cuts, he told reporters, would be credited toward further decreases in a future comprehensive spending plan covering the remainder of the fiscal year. Boehner, an Ohio Republican, brushed aside questions about a longer extension, telling reporters that Democrats should have approached him earlier about that possibility. ""I think we're taking the responsible path forward,"" Boehner said.  ""The American people want us to get our fiscal house in order, and this is a step in the right direction."" The last Democratic Congress went on a ""spending spree,"" declared Kentucky Representative Harold Rogers, the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.  Now ""we're trying to slow down and stop"" it. Democrats have repeatedly argued Republicans are exacerbating the budget crunch by refusing to allow an expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. Congress should use the two weeks provided by the bill for a ""reality check,"" said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California.  ""I just want to know where everyone was when the deficit grew in the eight years of the Bush administration."" Even if the two-week funding measure passes Congress and is signed into law, the White House and congressional Republicans will remain in a bitter standoff over how best to fund the government for the rest of the current fiscal year. The House recently passed a measure that would cut $61 billion in funding for the rest of the year, largely by imposing cuts in domestic discretionary spending that Democrats insist are too severe, and Obama has threatened to veto it. At the same time, some conservative Republicans have pushed for a larger package of cuts totalling $100 billion from current spending levels. Democrats have highlighted a report from Moody's chief economist Mark Zandi, which concludes that the proposed GOP cuts would result in the loss of 700,000 jobs by the end of next year.  Republicans, in turn, are trumpeting a new General Accounting Office report showing that billions of additional dollars could be saved by eliminating needless program duplication and overlap. Obama told a group of governors at the White House on Monday that he is ""committed to funding only those things that work.""  But the domestic discretionary spending being targeted by the Republicans, he noted, accounts for only 12% of the entire budget.  New spending is required on priorities such as infrastructure modernization, he said. The country ""can't afford to kick the can down the road any longer"" on festering fiscal problems relating to entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, the president warned. Neither party has put forward a detailed proposal dealing with exploding entitlement costs. Jim Kessler, vice president for policy and a co-founder of Third Way, a centrist Democratic think tank, told CNN he expects ""there will be a greater level of cooperation than expected and a major deficit reduction plan involving entitlement spending sometime this year."" By contrast, longtime political observer Norman Ornstein thinks there could be one or two short shutdowns this year. ""You get two weeks by going for $4 billion in (easy) cuts. What do you go for now?"" said Ornstein. Ornstein, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, predicted it would be hard for Senate Democrats and House Republicans to agree on specific cuts anywhere near the magnitude of what the GOP wants. Any compromise, he noted, will be a hard sell for the 87 freshman conservatives in the House who would see a deal as a far cry from what they believe they were elected to do last November.

"Bucharest, Romania (CNN) -- After a nearly six-month investigation, authorities launched 70 raids at border crossings and other sites in western Romania Tuesday and detained as many as 100 border police, customs officials and suspected smugglers, police and prosecutors said. Those detained are suspected of smuggling huge quantities of cigarettes into Romania from neighboring Serbia, and face charges of bribery and facilitating smuggling, prosecutors said. The raids -- which forced the closure of several crossings on the Romanian-Serbian border -- started at 6 a.m. and were conducted by at least 1,000 anti-corruption prosecutors, police and security forces, authorities said. Many of the suspects' homes were also raided, they said. Officials confiscated cigarettes worth 500,000 euros ($683,550 U.S.), they added, in raids that were the culmination of a probe that dates back to August. Police helicopters flew dozens of the suspects to Bucharest for hearings at the National Anti-Corruption Department, authorities said. Prosecutors said those involved in the smuggling operations easily could make at least 5,000 euros ($6,835.50 U.S.) per illegal shipment, and there have been hundreds of shipments. Police and customs employee union leaders released a statement following the raids Tuesday, charging that all the smuggling operations were conducted within a well-organized network that had links up to the country's highest political levels and the profits of which possibly financed the ruling political party. They described the border police and customs employees working at the crossings as the pawns, and said shift bosses, customs managers and some union leaders who collected the bribes were the knights. The intermediate levels were made up of more union leaders and higher customs authority officials, all the way up to the queen, which the union officials charged may be high-ranking members of the ruling political party who appoint customs and border police chiefs. Romanian Interior Minister Traian Igas told reporters at a news conference after the raids that some of the union leaders are aware of the corruption at many crossings. ""I ask them to position themselves some way in order for us to know whether they're with us or with these people committing illegal acts,"" Igas said, adding that he does trust the border police and customs employees who are doing their jobs honestly. Last week, 59 border police and customs employees at the Siret crossing in eastern Romania were arrested on the same charges. The massive raids come after the interior ministers of France and Germany asked the European Commission to postpone Romania's scheduled entry into the Schengen zone next month because of corruption and security issues. The 25 European countries that are party to the Schengen agreement eliminated internal border controls between member states. Igas said the smuggling probe and arrests should be a positive signal for Europe that Romania is tackling the issues.","Authorities say 100 border police and customs officials are detained in Tuesday raids .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- India's federal police have arrested two senior officials involved in organizing last year's troubled Commonwealth Games in New Delhi for suspected corruption. Investigators have taken into custody Lalit Bhanot, former secretary-general of the organizing committee of the October 2010 event. Also placed under arrest was V.K. Verma, director-general of the committee. They have been held for a suspected over-priced purchase of a timing, scoring and result systems from a Swiss company, federal police spokesman R. K. Gaur said. India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which is probing allegations of massive corruption in the conduct of the Commonwealth Games of last year in New Delhi, had earlier arrested four other committee officials. Bhanot and Verma are seen as close aides of Suresh Kalmadi, India's chief organizer of the sporting event that attracted international headlines for alleged scams and messy preparations. A series of scandals in 2010 have put Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government on the defensive. This week, Singh  acceded to opposition demands to order a cross-party probe into an alleged multi-billion dollar fraud related to  the award of mobile-phone licenses three years ago. Politicians, bureaucrats, officials and company executives linked to probes have denied any wrongdoing. Several high-profile corporate leaders have also been questioned by police in connection with the sale of radiowaves in 2008. Investigators have arrested A. Raja, who quit as telecom minister as the scandal battered Singh's government. Singh reiterated Thursday that the guilty will be punished. ""No wrongdoer will escape penalties,"" he told lawmakers.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan has slipped to the world's third largest economy, falling behind the blistering speed of China's manufacturing growth, according to Japanese figures released Monday. Japan's cabinet office released its nominal gross domestic product figures for 2010. Japan's economy was valued at US $5.4742 trillion dollars while China was at US $5.8786 trillion. Japan's economy did grow in 2010, but only 3.9%, according to the government. China's is expected to grow more than 10%. At the speed China is growing, Japan's government predicts China will overtake the United States as the world's largest economy in less than 20 years. China has expanded domestic industries and infrastructure, driven by a surge in exports. Multinational corporations have expanded in China, taking advantage of low labor costs. Japan, meanwhile, has been stuck in stagnation and deflation for two decades. Decisive economic policy has been lost in the revolving door of the country's top leader, with Japan seeing six prime ministers in just five years. Looking ahead, Japan is facing a demographic tsunami, with the world's fastest aging population and one of the globe's lowest birth rates. On the national debt issue, Japan's parliament is struggling to cap its GDP-to-debt ratio, which is nearing 200% -- the world's highest among developed nations. The size of an economy does not tell the entire picture: Japan's GDP per head is around $40,000 while China's is $4,500. The standards of living remain remarkably different in the two countries. But the economic size of a country gives a snapshot of not just the financial influence of a nation, but its power in the world's political sphere.","Japan's economy is now third in the world, with China moving into second place .

"Manama, Bahrain (CNN) -- A crush of protesters covered the streets of Bahrain's capital Tuesday in an anti-regime protest. Tens of thousands of people marched in the biggest anti-government rally since the public disturbances in the island nation erupted last week, and chants of ""No Shia, No Sunni, only Bahraini"" and ""The regime must go"" rang through the multitudes tramping across the center of Manama. The turnout was led by ambulance workers involved in rescuing some of those injured in the assault by security forces last Thursday on the Pearl Roundabout, which has been the epicenter of the Shiite-dominated protest movement. The rally -- which comes after thousands of people attended a funeral for a protester slain last week -- was a massive display of popular scorn toward an embattled government working to forge stability. But it unfolded amid major gestures by the kingdom. King Hamad touted a ""national dialogue"" and urged Bahrainis ""to engage in this new process"" and ""move away from polarization,"" a government statement said Tuesday. The king has held meetings with opposition members, community leaders and businesspeople ""from all sections of society"" to pave the way for a formalized dialogue process. ""The national dialogue is aimed at bringing to everyone in Bahrain the opportunity to contribute to Bahrain's future path of reform,"" the statement said. The kingdom also ordered the release of a number of prisoners and closed cases against several Shiite leaders accused of plotting against the kingdom, the country's state news agency reported Tuesday. That cleared the way for Hassan Mushaimaa, leader of Bahrain's largest opposition party, the Haq Movement, to return to the country from London.  His aides said he was expected in Bahrain later Tuesday. Mushaimaa's Haq Movement is more hard-line than the opposition Wefaq party, which includes 18 people in the 40-member parliament. Many members of his movement are opposed to the government monarchy, but Mushaimaa said he will support the protesters whether they want a ""new system in a constitutional kingdom"" or want ""to change the regime."" Mushaimaa, who had been living in exile, had previously been detained by the government for campaigning for more democratic rights in the island monarchy. Bahrain last year asked the international police agency Interpol for help in arresting Mushaimaa, whom the government accused of a terrorist plot to destroy state buildings and of planning a coup. But the king's decision closed the books on the case against Mushaimaa, giving him the freedom to return without fear of arrest. An aide told CNN that Mushaimaa has been held up in Beirut, where he was stopped and held by airport security and questioned for hours. The aide believes that this was because of the arrest warrant in September on charges of wanting to overthrow the government and he said that perhaps the wanted lists for Arab states haven't been updated. The king also is working to ""ensure that sectarianism does not take root in Bahrain."" Young members of the country's Shiite Muslim majority have staged violent protests in recent years to complain about discrimination, unemployment and corruption, issues they say the country's Sunni rulers have done little to address. Protesters initially took to the streets of Manama last week to demand reform and the introduction of a constitutional monarchy. But some are now calling for the removal of the royal family, which has led the Persian Gulf state since the 18th century. There were outbursts of government assaults on peaceful protesters last week, acts that drew international condemnation. The Bahraini government statement said that seven people had died during protests in the nation and 25 people remained hospitalized. Protesters had given a higher death toll, placing the figure at 10 or 11. Thousands of additional protesters moved into Pearl Roundabout on Monday, a growing gathering that has taken on an air of permanence since government forces retreated on Saturday and demonstrators reoccupied the symbolic location. Tents, some of them outfitted with furniture and occupied by entire families, dot the epicenter of the Bahrain protest movement -- a setting similar to the one in Tahrir Square in Cairo, where Egyptians staged daily demonstrations that led to the removal of President Hosni Mubarak. The Bahrain Center for Human Rights says authorities launched a clampdown on dissent in late 2010. It accused the government of torturing some human rights activists.","Thousands demonstrate in Bahrain .

"London (CNN) -- Mention bedbugs and the natural reaction is to shudder and start scratching. But one who doesn't get the heebee jeebees is Lola -- canine detective and professional bedbug catcher. Trained at the Pepe Canine Academy in Florida, the two-year-old Jack Russell is all that pest controller Mark Astley needs. With Lola's heightened sense of smell, Astley can identify bedbugs and their eggs without having to rely on the telltale signs -- feces that appear as tiny black spots that smear when wiped. Bedbugs like to stay close to people -- ""anything that is in close proximity to where we are or where we sleep,"" explains Astley, owner of Trust K9. ""Seventy percent of bedbugs tend to be quite close to us, and then within 5 foot, we've got (another) 23%, research shows,"" he says. The remaining 7% lurk in the extremities of a house, he says, including corners, in the fabric of the house, in the carpet, behind baseboards, behind wardrobes, and in drawers. The house he is investigating in Essex, England is empty. The tenants moved out when the first bedbugs appeared, leaving the landlord, who wants to remain anonymous, to deal with the problem. Wagging her tail and pulling on the leash, Lola is ready to work. Astley gives the command ""Find your Bs"" and Lola starts sniffing. It is in the main bedroom that Lola strikes gold. Next to the wardrobe, she steadies herself with her hind legs and furiously scratches the edge of carpet by the baseboard with her little paws. ""Good girl! Good girl!"" Astley shrieks and rewards her with biscuits. A few chomps later, Lola is off again. Now that key areas have been identified, Astley can have a closer look to assess how bad the problem is. ""I'm looking for either bedbug eggs ... feces -- black spots, take a finger over it and see if it smears. Immediately looking along here ... there's nothing obvious here ... it could well be they are burrowed deep,"" he says. ""Ah! There you go. There's a bedbug."" The size of this blood-sucker is surprising -- slightly bigger than an apple seed. Bedbugs go through five stages of its life, shedding their skin twice in each stage, as they fatten up with blood. They can lay up to 500 eggs in their lifetime. Bedbugs can take 10 to 14 days to hatch and will lay dormant, in some cases up to a year, if they can't detect anyone in the room breathing. It is the carbon dioxide we exhale that alerts them to come and bite us. Pest control companies like Trust K9 are seeing the number of jobs rocket every year specifically to treat bedbugs. Rentokil has seen a 24% increase in bedbug exterminations in the United Kingdom over the past year. ""It's becoming more widespread. In recent years bedbug numbers have gone up between 100-500% in North America, in Europe and in parts of Asia and Australia"" said Rowan Hooper, news editor for the New Scientist magazine. ""Perhaps the reason they're becoming more widespread is they've evolved resistance from the normal pesticides that have been used to kill them off,"" he speculates. The global resurgence of bedbugs is also related the rise in second-hand clothes and furniture shops, and an increase in travel to and from infested regions, typically along the old Silk Route to the far east. In the United States, the problem has become bad enough that the Environmental Protection Agency has convened two summits on the issue. The crisis is not likely to subside any time soon, scientists said at the most recent one, earlier this month. Astley gets rid of bedbugs by transforming the infested house into an oven. There are no chemicals involved -- just very hot air. That has the advantage of killing all of them, including their eggs, he says. Working with Canadian company DRYAIR, he heats the house to 134 degrees Fahrenheit (67 degrees Celsius) for two to three hours. Nothing can hide -- bedbugs, lice, mites, cockroaches, he says. Starting at $2,000 for a two-bedroom house, heat treatment is faster and more expensive than chemical sprays, at $480. Chemical treatment is effective but takes up to 21 days to break the life cycle of bedbugs because the chemicals cannot kill their eggs. With heat, an infested room or house can be treated at 8 in the morning and be bug-free by the evening, Astley says. That is good news for hotels who do not want to lose money or their reputation. ""We do get quite a lot of reports of bedbugs,"" says Emma O'Boyle from the travel website Tripadvisor. ""Of course it's the hotelier's responsibility to sort it out -- and quite often if they notice a review that says 'we've experienced bedbugs,' they have the opportunity to go on there do a right to reply and we always recommend that,"" she says. Announcing that they have had the hotel fumigated can help reassure potential guests, she adds. If you type in ""bedbugs"" on Tripadvisor, more than 42,000 results come up -- hotel reviews from disgruntled guests. The site, which has more than 40 million hotel reviews, also brings out a ""dirtiest hotels"" list every year, naming and shaming the worst offenders from North America, Europe, Asia and India. One hotel in the dirtiest European Hotels 2011 list had the comment: ""25 bedbugs between the two of us."" Bedbugs can spoil any holiday or business trip but there are a few myths that need to be dispelled. ""The biggest myth is that you've got to be a dirty person to get bed bugs -- it's absolute rubbish because bedbugs don't discriminate between rich or poor, dirty or clean. I know for a fact five-star hotels suffer from them, right down to your bed and breakfasts,"" says Astley, adding he has treated seven hotels in London so far this year. And it's very easy to pick them up, he warns. ""We put something down... in a hotel room or somewhere we're staying that has a high occupancy or common turnover, and they climb on. They're like little hitchhikers,"" he says. ""I've come out of a hotel with Lola and she's walked passed the baggage in the lobby and spun round and started alerting on somebody's luggage."" If it feels like your hotel room has some unwelcome guests, have a look around the corners of the mattress and the bed frame for those ""felt-tip"" black spots and rub your finger over them to see if they smear. If there are no other rooms available to move into, then the safest place for you and your luggage is the bath -- bedbugs don't like shiny surfaces.","One London exterminator works with Lola, a specially trained bug-finding dog .

"(CNN) -- Masked gunmen attacked and burned the an independent television station in Iraq's Kurdistan region Sunday, wounding a guard, police officials and the broadcast company said. The attack occurred as hundreds of protesters demonstrated in central Sulaimaniya in northern Iraq, following clashes with security forces in previous days that left one person dead and more than 70 injured. Most of the demonstrators opposed Massoud Barazani, Kurdistan regional president, and the ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party, and the protest occurred a few hundred meters from the KDP party office. Police officials told CNN that Kurdish security forces were investigating the attack Sunday morning on NRT Kurdish television in Sulaimaniya. According to the officials, the pre-dawn attack destroyed equipments and furniture, and the station was set on fire. Bahrooz Qashani, the governor of Sulaimaniya, condemned the attack on the broadcast station. In a statement, NRT TV said 50 armed attackers stormed a gated community called ""German Village"" where the station is located. The attackers fired weapons at broadcast equipment and burned the entire building, wounding one NRT guard, according to the statement. A trail of blood spots from the station indicated one or more of the attackers was wounded, said the NRT statement. NRT, the first independent television station in Northern Iraq, started broadcasting on February 17, and was the only station to air footage of shots fired at demonstrators on the first day of the protests, according to the statement. ""The destruction of the station comes at a time when all the other satellite channels cannot cover the events adequately,"" the statement said, adding that the broadcast company's owner had been threatened by local politicians on Saturday night. ""Now, no other TV channels are left to independently cover events in Kurdistan."" Twana Osman, the general manager of NRT, said the regional government and ruling party ""must be held responsible for this crime until the perpetrators are found and arrested,"" the statement said. NRT is the first independent satellite channel funded by the private sector in northern Iraq, according to the statement. Meanwhile, two other protests took place Sunday in cities south of Baghdad. In Nasiriya, more than 200 college students protested over lack of jobs and demanded that the local government find them employment. The protesters walked from Habobi Square in central Nasiriya to the Provincial Council's building. A committee representing the protesters then met with government officials. Separately, in al-Batha, west of Nasiriya, hundreds of angry demonstrators rallied against corruption, lack of basic services and unemployment. Protesters also demanded the replacement of the city council, which they accuse of corruption. On Saturday, clashes between police and protesters in Sulaimaniya injured 14 people, according to a regional health official. Witnesses said police used water cannons and fired weapons over the heads of rock-throwing demonstrators who had taken to the streets to protest the violent response of security forces that killed one demonstrator and injured 57 who attacked the local offices of the Kurdistan Democratic Party. Saturday's protesters shouted ""Down, down with Massoud Barzani"" in a demonstration that began at 11:30 a.m. and lasted several hours. The clash with police happened when dozens of protesters attempted to attack the local KDP headquarters for a second time. Among the injured was a police officer. Most of those hurt suffered minor injuries, according to Raytok Hama Salih, the head of the health department in Sulaimaniya province. The violence followed another demonstration by hundreds of students at Sulaimaniya University seeking the release of people arrested in previous protests and the prosecution of a local party official they said ordered security forces to open fire. On Thursday, Barzani issued a statement saying the protests were the work of a ""very small group of people determined to undermine the stability of the region."" The regional government is organizing a meeting between government leaders and representatives of opposition groups scheduled for Monday, according to the statement. The protests are the latest in a string of recent demonstrations across Iraq, apparently inspired by popular uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia and focusing on complaints of rampant unemployment and poor government services. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq and journalist Shirko Abdullah contributed to this report.","Armed attackers damage equipment, burn down the building .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- At least 12 people were killed and 24 others wounded in a suicide bombing Thursday in the Iraqi city of Ramadi, police said. The assailant, wearing a explosives-laden vest, blew himself up at a cultural center where people had gathered for a celebration of the Prophet Mohammed's birth, Ramadi police said. Among the injured was Hakmat Zaydan, the deputy governor of heavily Sunni Anbar province. Ramadi, the provincial capital about 100 kilometers (62 miles) west of Baghdad, was once a haven for al Qaeda in Iraq and witnessed some of the fiercest fighting in the Iraq war. Violence has dropped dramatically from a few years ago but attacks still occur.","24 people were wounded in the attack in Ramadi, police say .

"Seattle (CNN) -- A libel case against the parents of Amanda Knox ""feels very personal,"" the mother of the American student convicted of murder in Italy told CNN. ""I wouldn't say the Italian justice system (is after us.) I would say a few people in Perugia, definitely,"" Edda Mellas said, referring to the central Italian city where Knox was tried for the 2007 killing of her British roommate Meredith Kercher. She cited a radio commentator who suggested the authorities' attitude seemed to be: ""Maybe if we keep at them they'll go away or go bankrupt or whatever. ""But it's not stopping us,"" she said. ""It's all about truth and justice and we have done nothing wrong,"" she said. ""Amanda's allowed to tell her story and she's been saying it hundreds of times since she was arrested,"" Mellas said. ""When we get asked, 'What did Amanda tell you?', we tell the truth: Here's what Amanda said. And that's why we're being charged."" Mellas and her ex-husband, Curt Knox, were indicted Tuesday on charges of libeling police in Perugia, she and the family's Italian attorney said. In a 2009 interview in the Sunday Times of London, they said that their daughter ""had not been given an interpreter, had not received food and water, and had been physically and verbally abused"" by police after her arrest for the murder of the exchange student, according to Italy's ANSA news agency. They also said police struck her and told her ""things will get worse for you"" if she requested an attorney. ""Yes, I am going to trial for libel ... along with one of my lawyers and a group of journalists,"" Mellas told CNN Tuesday. ""We are very upset by this decision,"" said Luciano Ghirga, Amanda Knox's attorney who represents her family in this case. ""We worked toward a dismissal because there was no intent"" on the part of Knox's parents to libel the police, he said. The indictment says their claims were ""contrary to the truth,"" according to ANSA. ""We knew this was coming for a while,"" Mellas said. ""I got served my papers a year ago, back over a year ago, so I knew, we knew this was coming."" She said she would attend hearings in her own trial only if she happened to be in Italy anyway. But she would continue to fight the charges for fear she could be arrested in Italy if she does not, she said. ""We have to jump through the hoops until I know that I will never have to go back to that country again,"" she said. ""I think our case may go years, depending on what happens in Perugia. If we're found guilty we will appeal, even if it means going to the Supreme Court,"" she said. She said fighting the charges had been financially draining. ""I think we've mortgaged just about everything we can mortgage, but there's been very kind people who have sent donations to help pay for Amanda's defense,"" she said. A hearing in the parents' case is set for July 4, Ghirga said. ""These are old charges,"" said David Marriott, spokesman for the family. ""They've been around since 2009."" The story in question was published in 2008, he said, and Knox's parents were repeating what their daughter had told them. The indictment, Marriott said, finalizes the charges the prosecutor had filed and is ""nothing surprising."" Knox's parents' focus is not on their case, he said, but on her appeal of her conviction, which is under way. There is a break in the proceedings for experts to retest forensic evidence, he said. ""This is, I guess you'd call it, a bit of a minor distraction,"" Marriott said. Knox, 23, was sentenced in December to 26 years in prison for Kercher's death at the villa the two shared in Perugia, the central Italian town where both were students. Kercher, 21, was found dead in November 2007, semi-naked with her throat slashed. Knox and her former Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were both found guilty of the murder. Sollecito is serving a 25-year sentence. A third person, Rudy Guede, a drifter originally from the Ivory Coast, was tried separately and is serving a 16-year prison sentence. The forensic experts retesting evidence as part of Knox's appeal must conclude their analysis by May 9 and their results are to be presented on May 21 to a jury composed of two judges and six citizens. Evidence being retested includes a knife found in Sollecito's apartment with Knox's DNA on the handle and what Perugia prosecutors say is Kercher's DNA in a tiny groove on the blade. The prosecution contends that the knife was used to stab Kercher in the neck and that it had been cleaned. The DNA matter attributed to Kercher consists of flesh, not blood, they say. The sample, however, was so small that forensic scientists investigating Kercher's murder were not able to double test it in accordance with international forensic science norms, which Knox's legal team says raises doubts about its validity. The second piece of evidence the forensic experts will test is the tiny metal clasp from Kercher's bra, which was cut from her body after her slaying. Forensic scientists in the investigatory phase determined that Sollecito's DNA is present on the metal clasp. The clasp was identified on an investigatory video on November 2, 2007, when Kercher's body was found. But the clasp was not collected until nearly six weeks later, giving the defense cause to question whether the sample may have been contaminated. The court is not expected to make a final ruling on the appeal until next summer. CNN's Drew Griffin, Hada Messia, Ashley Hayes, Todd Schwarzschild and journalist Barbie Nadeau contributed to this report.","NEW:A new indictment against Curt Knox and Edda Mellas will not stop them, she says .

"(CNN) -- Gautam Gambhir became the most expensive signing in world cricket on a record-breaking first day of the Indian Premier League auctions. The Kolkata Knights Riders paid $2.4 million to secure the rights of the India international batsman on Saturday, and then stumped up $2.1 million to buy Yusuf Pathan for the next two years of the lucrative Twenty20 limited-overs competition. New franchise Sahara Pune Warriors matched that sum with the signing of another Indian star, Robin Uthappa, while Mumbai Indians put up $2 million for Rohit Sharma. Pathan's half-brother Irfan was sold to Delhi Daredevils for $1.9 million, while Pune also paid $1.8 million for one-day specialist Yuvraj Singh. The most expensive non-Indian player was Sri Lanka's Mahela Jayawardene, who went to another new franchise, Kochi, for $1.5 million. Australia's David Hussey was bought for $1.4 million by Kings XI Punjab. See the full list of successful bids . Kolkata also signed veteran South Africa batsman Jacques Kallis for $1.2 million, while Royal Challengers Bangalore bid $1.1 million for his compatriot A.B. de Villiers -- a fee matched by Deccan Chargers for Australia's Cameron White. The auction concluded on Sunday, with 350 of the world's top players having gone under the hammer. Franchise owners include Bollywood stars Shilpa Shetty and Preity Zinta. Notably absent was tournament founder Lalit Modi, who has been ousted from his position as chairman by the Indian cricket board amid allegations of corruption.

"(RealSimple.com) -- A lengthy separation -- and a surprise trip to Paris -- caused this husband and wife to realize that their marriage could be saved. Mary L. Tabor and Del Persinger Washington, D.C. Married 26 years . Mary was still in her nightgown and robe, sipping a cappuccino in the kitchen of the Washington, D.C., brownstone she shared with her husband, Del, when he walked in and announced he wanted to live alone. They had been married for 21 years. ""I didn't know what had hit me,"" Mary, 64, recalls of that fall morning in 2005. ""I wondered, does he have a girlfriend? A boyfriend? I had no idea what was wrong."" Although the couple's relationship had been strained for a few months, Mary simply assumed they were going through a rough patch. She attributed Del's loss of interest in sex and his suddenly quick temper to stress from his high-pressure job as a financial analyst. ""Del was so on edge that he would yell at me about every little thing -- like a knife accidentally placed in the dishwasher with the point up,"" says Mary, a writer and a teacher. Still, she figured that things would soon return to normal. RealSimple.com: How to break bad habits . For Del, the decision had been a long time coming. Increasingly restless within his marriage, he wondered whether it was holding him back from leading a more exciting life. ""I knew the problem wasn't Mary -- it was me,"" he says. ""And I felt I needed to work through my mixed emotions alone."" To Mary's frustration, Del couldn't articulate any of these concerns -- all she knew was that he wanted a separation. She and Del took turns sleeping in the guest room for a few months until she moved into an apartment of her own. By January 2006, the couple had hired attorneys. Their home, which they had spent the previous seven years painstakingly renovating, was put up for sale. Mary felt ""broken"" without Del, who had helped her raise two children from her first marriage and supported her through the deaths of her parents and sister. ""He understood me better than anyone,"" she says. She tried to move on and began dating other men -- to little avail. ""I was still in love with my husband."" For Del, the bachelor lifestyle lost its luster rather quickly. ""I thought the separation would allow me to make all those friends I never had, do all the things I never did,"" says Del, 61. But in reality his days were fairly mundane. ""I went to work, went to the gym, and spent the rest of my time reading."" He also found himself stalling on the divorce negotiations, bringing up smaller and smaller details. In retrospect, he realizes he probably did that to prolong the process indefinitely. By August 2009, the couple had cautiously started spending time together again, even venturing out on a few dates. ""It wasn't the dinners or dances that made me feel in love, but the conversations,"" says Mary. Del, who had been seeing a therapist, finally opened up to her about his worries and fears. ""To me, the most seductive thing a man can do is be truly honest,"" says Mary. Del had clearly experienced a change of heart. But Mary, concerned it wouldn't last, wanted time to think. In the winter of 2009, she took an extended trip alone to Paris. One morning, as she was having her breakfast, her cell phone rang. It was Del. He had flown in from D.C. and was outside her building. Could he come up? Mary buzzed him in, and when he reached her doorway, suitcase in hand, he told her how much he loved her. That grand romantic gesture, so out of character for Del, ""moved me deeply,"" says Mary. ""At that moment, I thought our marriage could be saved."" RealSimple.com: Things worth admitting to . A few weeks later, the pair flew home together. Del sold his apartment and moved in with Mary. Divorce proceedings were halted. Their ""new"" relationship is free of the stressful arguments that were so commonplace back in 2005, the couple report. ""I'm not confused anymore, so I'm a more contented person,"" says Del. ""Del is at ease with himself, and that makes him at ease in the world,"" Mary explains. ""When people hear that Del left me, they say, 'You were betrayed!' But I don't feel that way.

"Munich, Germany (CNN) -- The ongoing unrest in Egypt cast a long shadow Saturday over the Munich Security Conference, a gathering set up to address global security issues. While other items -- including terrorism and the New START treaty between the United States and Russia -- were on the agenda, it was impossible for leaders at the conference to ignore the crisis. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton signaled that the United States is backing a transition led by newly appointed Egyptian vice president. ""I think it's important to follow the transition process announced by the Egyptian government, actually headed by Vice President Omar Suleiman,"" she said. However, the envoy who delivered a message from U.S. President Barack Obama to Egypt's leaders this week, Frank Wisner, told the conference via videolink that Mubarak must remain in office, despite protesters' call for his resignation. U.S. officials emphasized that Wisner was speaking for himself, as an expert on the region, and not for the Obama administration. ""President Mubarak remains utterly critical in the days ahead as we sort our way toward the future,"" said Wisner, a former U.S. ambassador to Egypt. The Middle East ""is being battered by a perfect storm of powerful trends,"" Clinton said at the annual conference. A growing majority in the region are under the age of 30, and many are unable to find work, she said. They are connected with each other and with events around them by technology. ""And this generation is rightly demanding that their governments become more effective, more responsive and more open,"" Clinton said. Meanwhile, resources such as water and oil are running out, she added. ""Leaders in the region may be able to hold back the tide for a little while, but not for long,"" she said. ""This is what has driven demonstrators into the streets of Tunis, Cairo and cities throughout the region. The status quo is simply not sustainable."" The conference, attended by leaders from United States, Europe and Asia, found cooperation on various issues, including preventing violence during the recent referendum in Southern Sudan and curbing piracy off the coast of Somalia. Clinton and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov signed and exchanged instruments of ratification for the New START treaty Saturday, meaning it takes effect. Clinton called it a ""milestone"" in the U.S.-Russian partnership; Lavrov said the U.S. and Russian teams ""worked as one team"" to get the treaty negotiated and adopted. The agreement, formally known as the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, replaces START 1, which expired in December 2009. The U.S. Senate approved the New START pact last December, while the Russian parliament . ratified it in January. It is designed to slash the stockpile of strategic nuclear weapons in both countries to 1,550 warheads -- down from a current cap of 2,200 -- and 700 launchers. It also calls for a resumption of inspections of nuclear arsenals that ended when START 1 expired and helps move forward White House efforts to ""reset"" U.S.-Russian relations. While leaders could not ignore the tumult in Egypt, they stopped short Saturday of endorsing protesters' demands for Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to step down. Instead, they indicated Mubarak should be given time to implement changes. While it's important to push for reform, ""we shouldn't in the West say this leader should go or that leader should go,"" said British Prime Minister David Cameron. ""There is no stability in Egypt today,"" Cameron said. ""We need change and reform and transition to get greater stability. ... The more it is put off, the more it would create an Egypt that we wouldn't welcome, the more that case will be strengthened."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel also said stability should be restored before the next steps are taken. ""Early elections at the beginning of the democratization process is probably the wrong approach,"" she said. Right now, there is no leadership to transition to, she added. ""We need to give people the chance to set up the right structures."" Wisner, however, went further, noting that the Egyptian constitution is clear -- ""if the presidency is vacated, then the speaker of parliament takes over and in a couple of months, you have elections. Those elections would take place under the current dispositions. Those dispositions are currently unacceptable to those protesting in the streets of Cairo today."" Changes are needed, he said, and ""the president must say in office in order to steer those changes through. ... It's his opportunity to write his own legacy."" He said the present situation is ""an ideal moment for (Mubarak) to show the way forward."" He said commentary from outside Egypt should be restrained, as calls for Mubarak to go create a ""negative force"" inside Egypt. Wisner was sent to Egypt early this week to deliver a message from Obama to Mubarak and Suleiman, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said. Clinton also noted that ""there are risks with the transition to democracy. ""It can be chaotic. It can cause short-term instability,"" she said, and in some cases, demonstrators have overthrown dictators only to have the election process hijacked. ""Chaos and uncertainty"" arises in the absence of security, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said. ""We see this across a diverse geography of troubled places, most recently in Tunisia, Egypt and other countries of the Middle East. ""We do not know how these events will end,"" Ban said. ""But this much we do know: They are driven, at bottom, by human insecurity: poverty, diminished or disappointed expectations; the lack of good governance: corruption, ineffective public institutions, a deficit of democracy."" Cameron spoke on Islamist extremism and the threat it poses to security, noting that it differs from Islam -- and that ""the ideology of extremism is the problem. Islam, emphatically, is not."" Those who say the West should cut itself off from the Muslim world should look to recent events in Tunisia and Egypt, he said, for an example of how Western values and Islam can be compatible. He seemed to suggest in his speech that Britain has been too tolerant of extremism, however. ""When a white person holds objectionable views -- racism, for example -- we rightly condemn them,"" Cameron said. ""But when equally unacceptable views or practices have come from someone who isn't white, we've been too cautious, frankly even fearful, to stand up to them. ... This hands-off tolerance has only served to reinforce the sense that not enough is shared. ""All this leaves some young Muslims feeling rootless,"" he said. ""And the search for something to belong to and believe in can lead them to this extremist ideology."" He said that instead of ignoring extremist ideology, ""we -- as governments and societies -- have got to confront it, in all its forms. And second, instead of encouraging people to live apart, we need a clear sense of shared national identity, open to everyone."" Also on the agenda is the struggle between Israelis and Palestinians. The Middle East Quartet, composed of the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations, met in Munich on the matter -- but noted in a statement the effect the Egyptian upheaval could have on the peace process. ""The Quartet members considered the implications of these events for Arab-Israeli peace and agreed to discuss this further in upcoming meetings as a matter of high priority,"" the statement said. The group said it ""strongly urged"" Israel and the Palestinians ""to overcome current obstacles in the peace process. ... In view of the developments in the Middle East, the Quartet expressed its belief that further delay in the resumption of negotiations is detrimental to prospects for regional peace and security."" And it said it ""regrets the discontinuation of Israel's 10-month moratorium on settlement activity"" -- a hot-button issue for the Palestinians. The Quartet will meet again in March, said Catherine Ashton, EU foreign affairs chief. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with Quartet Representative Tony Blair on Friday, and afterward the two announced what Netanyahu called ""a series of steps"" aimed at boosting economic prosperity and living standards for the Palestinians. Those steps include helping the Gaza Strip develop plants for electricity, water and sewage treatment, as well as diversifying gas supplies in the future. ""I don't delude myself for a second that an economic peace is a substitute for political peace,"" Netanyahu said. ""We need both."" He said he hoped the Palestinians would enter direct negotiations. Blair said he was pleased by the measures, and said they should result in a ""radical overhaul of Gaza's infrastructure."" However, he also noted, ""none of this is a substitute for a credible political process."" But chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat on Friday scoffed at the measures, saying, ""The only thing that will build Palestinian confidence is Mr. Netanyahu saying, 'I will stop building settlements.'"" Until Israeli construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem stops, and the Netanyahu government accepted a two-state solution, negotiations -- which broke down in September -- will not resume, he said. CNN's Elise Labott, Antonia Mortensen and Kevin Flower contributed to this report.","NEW: Mubarak must stay in office, Obama envoy says .

Hirvonen, who won the corresponding race last season, showed his liking for the only rally of this status held solely on snow, with a commanding victory. Teammate Mads Ostberg of Norway finished at 6.5 seconds and Finland's Jari-Matti Latvala was 34 seconds adrift in third. Seven-time defending champion Sebastien Loeb finished well off the pace in sixth after suffering delays on Friday. But the Frenchman had the consolation of claiming second in his Citroen on the inaugural Power Stage which has been introduced by organizers to boost interest in the series and is televised live. Loeb's compatriot Sebastien Ogier claimed victory on the stage, which concluded the competitive action. It earned him three bonus points in the standings as he finished fourth. The 30-year-old Hirvonen could afford to avoid mistakes in the final showdown as he took his 13th world rally championship victory after finishing runner-up to Loeb in the 2008 and 2009 title races.

""The car has been quick straight away and after a tough season last year I am really pleased with this,"" he added. Hirvonen had led going into the final day of the Karlstad-based race with just over 15 seconds dividing the first five drivers. He was pushed all the way by 23-year-old Ostberg, who took the lead on Friday's opening stage and drove without error for his best career result alongside Swedish co-driver Jonas Andersson.

"(CNN) -- Talk about planned parenting. Just over a decade ago, a proud father began taking daily pictures of his newborn daughter. Then, he kept it up almost every day until the girl, Natalie, turned 10 (and even afterwards). Now, the video collection that resulted is compressed into one minute, 25 seconds, making it the YouTube era's equivalent of the pencil mark on the kitchen wall every time your child grows an inch -- but much, much cooler. More than 2.5 million people have watched Natalie grow to age 10 on the video, but age progression movies are almost as old as YouTube itself. A classic one from 2006, the 7 million-viewed ""Girl takes pic of herself every day for three years,"" has a young woman compiling her daily photos into a minute-long slideshow. Another one from 2006, ""Noah takes a photo of himself every day for 6 years,"" has a crazy 17 million views. What makes Natalie's case remarkable -- and others less so -- is that you actually see her changing and growing over time in her video. Let's face it. After puberty, people rarely change dramatically in appearance within a few months without some extreme circumstances (like, say, pregnancy!). Ten years of an adult might be interesting, but would almost never be as dramatic as a decade observing the average kid. Years ago, British filmmaker Michael Apted began following a group of 7-year-old children and reconnected with them every seven years for his ""7 Up"" film series. The groundbreaking documentaries show people evolving physically and mentally over the course of their lifetimes.

"(CNN) -- Australia fought back to earn a 1-1 draw with South Korea on Friday that edged two of the Asian Cup's title favorites towards the quarterfinal stage in Qatar. The result left both nations on four points from two matches in Group C ahead of the day's other game, which saw 10-man Bahrain get off the mark with a 5-2 victory over India as Ismaeel Abdulatif scored four goals. South Korea, victors the first two times the tournament was held in 1956 and 1960, took the lead in the 24th minute at Doha's Al Gharafa Stadium through Koo Ja-cheol. The 21-year-old midfielder scored his third goal of the tournament following his double in Korea's opening 2-1 win over Bahrain, as Ji Dong-won collected a long ball and put the ball into the path of his teammate. Both sides had several chances to score before Mile Jedinak leveled in the 62nd minute. In-depth guide to the Asian Cup . The midfielder, who plays for Turkish club Genclerbirligi, headed home after Korea failed to clear a corner from Luke Wilkshire and Lucas Neill nodded the ball back across the goal. ""We could have won the game. If you look at the general performance of our team, then we should have won,"" South Korea coach Cho Kwang-Rae told the Asian Cup website.

""What I found encouraging was we created a lot of chances."" Abdulatif's quadruple strike boosted Bahrain's hopes of qualifying for the last eight, as the 24-year-old forward scored three times in 19 first-half minutes against India.

"(CNN) -- I grew up an Air Force brat who typically moved to a new place every three years. I switched schools, made friends, then had to write letters to stay in touch when I inevitably left. Except for a precious few, most of those friends went away forever, lost to memory, fading and eventually anonymous in aging photos. But in the recurring dreams I had in my teenage years, they were all together. My friends from Oklahoma went to school with my classmates in Biloxi, Mississippi. My favorite teacher from my years in Germany got to see me grow up alongside my cousins from South Texas. It wasn't until many years later, when Facebook shot past its first 100 million users, that I began to get that sensation again, the one most frequent users are now well familiar with. It's that sense of worlds colliding, of unlikely paths crossing; your work life, home life, past life and present all mashing together, commented upon and decorated with photos from here and from there, from then and in the now. Facebook's enormous membership makes it a more likely spot than any other place on the English-language Web to connect with a multitude of family members, friends, former co-workers, old classmates and anyone else you haven't seen in the flesh for decades. It wasn't until the May series finale ""Lost,"" however, that I made another connection -- that this idea of people coming into your life and never going away is a lot like what many people believe the afterlife is like. Could it be that Facebook, the digital Tower of Babel built by a cocky Harvard student, is -- to paraphrase singer Belinda Carlisle -- sort of like what would happen if heaven were a place on earth? The thought led me to a theological search for the spirituality of Facebook connections. Amid the recent flood of political rants, children's Halloween photos and YouTube videos, many of us have seen status updates from friends offering Bible passages, spiritual quotes or information on upcoming religious services. Along with a few alarming blog posts (""Facebook killed the church,"" one bluntly proclaimed), I found a lot of theologians struggling to figure out whether mobile phones, social networks and text-messaging harm their religions or help reinvent them in positive ways. There's even debate on whether being so constantly connected to so many people is good or bad, spiritually speaking. Bruce Epperly, a theology professor, author and co-pastor in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, wrote a thoughtful piece about so-called ""Facebook theology,"" likening the ""intricate web of relationships"" in our lives to our online social network. He acknowledged that even the lowly, short-form status update can carry a profound holiness. ""It might surprise my high school friends to discover that I often pray for them as I read their posts,"" Epperly writes. ""I believe that Facebook can be an altar on the Internet and a place of spiritual awakening."" That seems to gibe with what Pope Benedict XVI proclaimed earlier this year. In January, the pontiff suggested that priests should embrace new digital communication mediums. But he stopped short of blessing Facebook itself as a virtual holy land. Facebook, which recently passed the 500-million-user mark, grew so quickly in such a short span of time that even its creators likely haven't been able to stop and examine the spiritual significance of its near-constant presence in so many lives. To what do we owe our continually growing house of ""friends,"" the ones we never see, never call, never write to, but who contribute to our digital chatter, our daily chorus. Don't those connections count for some kind of community? Wouldn't we miss it if all these non-strangers were lost to us again? What if Facebook itself, which digitally houses not only the living but also the ""memorial page"" dead, is a kind of pre-afterlife training where all those personal connections are forever maintained, even after you've shuffled off this analog coil? And if the afterlife exists, and it's anything like Facebook, does it have an ""Unfriend"" option? Because as much as I love all the connectedness, eternity sounds like a really long time to spend reading everyone's status updates.","Omar Gallaga: Commingling of people from various chapters of our lives has spiritual overtones .

"(CNN) -- Heavy winds and dry weather helped set off a rash of fires across a wide swath of north, central and west Texas on Sunday, state forestry officials said. The Texas Forest Service reported 15,000 acres caught fire across the state. The largest concentration of blazes broke out around the west Texas town of Midland and near the panhandle city of Amarillo, where meteorologists reported wind gusts of up to 69 miles an hour. There have been no fatalities, said Lewis Kearney, a spokesman for the forest service's Texas State Lone Star Incident Management Team. However, the high winds made it difficult for firefighters to use aircraft to contain the blazes. Kearney said heavy winds are expected to blow across much of the state into Monday, thus making it more likely that firefighters could be many hours away from dousing the final flames spread by the winds. Kearney said ""numerous homes"" have been burned in west Texas and that firefighters were continuing to battle the blazes as of Sunday night. In Amarillo, the National Weather Service reported that as of 2:32 p.m. CT Sunday afternoon a mandatory evacuation order had been issued in northeast Potter County. A second evacuation order was issued for the city of Borger a half hour later. Throughout the afternoon, fires consumed large swaths of land ranging from 30 to 800 acres in Haskell, Mitchell, Howard, Randall and Tom Green counties, among others.","Roughly 15,000 acres on fire in separate Texas blazes .

"(CNN) -- Discovery astronauts Steve Bowen and Alvin Drew are scheduled for a six-hour spacewalk outside the international space station Monday. The team prepared by holding a 14-hour ""campout"" in the station's Quest airlock. ""The airlock's atmospheric pressure will be lowered to help purge nitrogen from Bowen and Drew's bloodstreams, protecting them from 'the bends' when they leave the airlock for the vacuum of space,"" a statement on NASA's website said. They will install a power extension cable, move a failed ammonia pump and perform other operations outside the shuttle during the spacewalk. Discovery started its 39th and final flight with a launch late Thursday afternoon from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Originally scheduled for November, the shuttle's launch had been delayed to make repairs to the external tank's support beams. Astronauts spent Sunday moving items brought up on Discovery over to the space station. On Tuesday, day six of the mission, astronauts will work to attach a permanent module -- known as Leonardo -- to the station. The module will be home for experiments in fluid physics, materials science, biology, biotechnology and other subjects. The Discovery crew is headed by Steve Lindsey. Bowen, a late addition, became the first astronaut to fly consecutive missions after he was assigned to take the place of Tim Kopra when Kopra was injured last month in a bicycle accident, according to NASA. Prior to Thursday's launch, Discovery had spent 352 days in orbit, circling the Earth 5,628 times. It has also carried 246 crew members, more than any space vehicle in history. ""In a way, it's ... sad to see the last flight,"" astronaut Steven Swanson said Thursday. ""It's such a wonderful vehicle."" The last scheduled launch of Space Shuttle Endeavour is set for April 19. It will be commanded by Mark Kelly, the husband of U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who is recovering from being shot last month in Tucson, Arizona. The last shuttle mission will be Atlantis, tentatively scheduled to launch during the summer. Discovery was the first space shuttle to dock with a space station of any kind when it met up on June 4, 1998, with Russia's now defunct Mir space station. The craft also was the first to hook up with the international space station, doing so on May 29, 1999, according to NASA. Saturday's event marked the 13th such docking for the Discovery.","Astronauts are preparing for a spacewalk with a 14-hour ""campout""

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Raymond Davis, the American accused of killing two Pakistani men, appeared Friday in a Pakistani court, where he was handed documents that detailed the case against him. The court then adjourned until March 3 when Davis is expected to be formally charged. The case has strained relations between the United States and Pakistan, a key ally in the war against al Qaeda and the Taliban in neighboring Afghanistan, and the shooting deaths have outraged many Pakistanis. Meanwhile, Pakistani authorities have detained a second U.S. citizen, identified as Aaron Mark DeHaven, in Peshawar, according to a statement Friday by the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad. No additional details can be confirmed until a U.S. government representative meets with DeHaven, the statement said. Davis has said that the January 27 shooting occurred after two men attacked him as he drove through a busy Lahore neighborhood, according to the U.S. Embassy. U.S. officials originally said Davis was a diplomat and later revealed he is a CIA contractor, intensifying the already highly charged situation. During the court hearing Friday, Davis was handed over documents of evidence in the case, but he initially refused to accept them because they were in Urdu, a language he did not understand. Clerks were told to translate the documents into English. Davis told the judge that he should be released from jail because he has diplomatic immunity, the same argument other U.S. officials have used since Davis' arrest. The judge said he was waiting on a response from the Pakistani government on that issue and that it should happen at the March hearing. CNN's Reza Sayah contributed to this report.","CIA contractor Raymond Davis is accused of killing two Pakistani men .

"(CNN)  -- England's Luke Donald beat new world number one Martin Kaymer by 3&2 to win the snow-hit WGC-Accenture Match Play in Arizona Sunday. Freezing overnight conditions and the unexpected snowfall struck the Dove Mountain course ahead of the 18-hole final, but once it begun it was Donald who warmed to his task from the start. He pulled three clear by the fifth, play briefly held up by a hailstorm which left the players sheltering for cover, and was never headed. But Germany's Kaymer hit back when Donald three-putted the short sixth and a birdie on the par-5 eighth saw the gap cut to just one hole. PGA champion Kaymer drew level as Donald made a hash of the ninth, finding the desert rough with his second,  but that was as close as he got to victory. Donald took the lead again with a birdie on the long 11th, extended it at the next as Kaymer bogeyed and went three-up with a further birdie on the 15th. He closed out the biggest victory of his career on the short 16th and the $1.4 million check. It was his third win on the PGA Tour, but first since 2006, taking him to a career-high number three in the new rankings Monday behind Kaymer and compatriot Lee Westwood. ""It couldn't have gone any better -- not to get to the 18th hole in any match this week and pretty much go through reasonably stress-free,"" Donald told the official PGA Tour website. ""I played solid this week. It's nice to get the victory."" Donald had never trailed throughout his six matches and needed just 73 holes to reach the final, beating Tiger Woods' record of 77. Kaymer will console himself with taking over as No.1 from Westwood, but called Donald a ""very tough opponent"" as he could never get to grips with his Ryder Cup teammate in the cold conditions. In the all-American third place play-off, Matt Kuchar beat Bubba Watson 2&1 in a scrappy match.","Luke Donald wins WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship in Arizona .

"(CNN) -- More than 1 million cell phones in China have been struck by the ""Zombie"" virus, according to Chinese state media, CCTV and Xinhua. It's called the ""Zombie"" virus because it transmits from phone to phone, just as in the movies, zombie bites turn people into the living dead. The virus binds with a security application, which then transmits the user's SIM card details to a central server controlled by a small group of hackers. The hackers then will send messages or make phone calls that contain virus-ridden links for games and software, said CCTV. Receivers who follow the link will find their phones infected, too, while at the same time providing a ""click through"" for the link itself, which typically translates into a payment for a party publicizing the links. CCTV said that the blame is likely to lay with intermediary distributors instead of the actual game or software developers that show up in the ads. Zhou Yonglin, an official with the National Computer Network Emergency Coordination Center, told CCTV that ""in the first week of September, nearly 1 million cell phones in the country were infected with the virus."" And although telecom providers are said to have taken steps to reduce the number of infected messages, Zou Shihong, a telecom expert at the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, told CCTV that an updated virus might start sending fewer messages, making it harder for cell users to notice any suspicious activity. Chendu Qimiao, the company behind the original infected security application, told CCTV that is has nothing to do with the virus, adding that it's difficult for users to tell which applications are infected and which are safe.","The ""Zombie"" virus is transmitted from cell phone to cell phone .

"New York (CNN) -- Jorge Munoz is a bus driver in New York City who started feeding the hungry in Queens five years ago, using food that would otherwise have been thrown away. And that's how he discovered a secret -- the power of sharing. ""People are telling me, 'Jorge, you have no money, you do all this and get nothing back.' And I say I have a checking account full of smiles."" Munoz has been recognized as a Top Ten CNN Hero in 2009 and received the U.S. Citizens Award from President Obama. His website is AnAngelinQueens.org. Munoz spoke Wednesday with CNN's Elizabeth Belanger. Here is an edited transcript. CNN: What is it that made you decide to do what you do every day? Jorge Munoz: In the beginning it was to try to avoid wasting food in the garbage. But then I realized it was like a mission from God for my family. That's how we see it. I was working in a summer camp on Long Island and I was waiting for the kids on the bus, and across the street was a food processing plant. I saw a couple come out with a lot of food, and it was good food. I asked them about it and they said they had to throw it out every Friday. But it was good food and I asked them about it, if they could give it to me because I knew someone would want it. So in Jackson Heights I saw people waiting on the corner, and I asked them what they were doing and they said they had no money for food. So I called my mom and I said I had people to give the food to. At first we brought food for eight guys. And a few days later I saw a few of them on the corner and I asked them about it and they said they sleep under the bridge. That's when I decided to bring them food [every day]. And the first week it was eight guys, and the next week 24 and so on. Take the iReport challenge: Be an everyday hero . CNN: Are you out there every day? What do you provide for people? Munoz: In these 6 ½ years we've been doing it, I've missed one day because of a snowstorm. And we've distributed 121,000 meals over the years, might be more. But every day we make 120 to 140 meals. For the last few months, every piece of bread I get I bring in the morning with soda or water that I buy. Besides meals, we provide hot coffee, tea, a piece of cake and sometimes my mom makes chicken soup. And when I have money I provide fruit. When I have a budget, when winter is here, I provide caps, underwear, winter hats, scarves, boots. And this time of the year, on the website, I ask for coat donations. I need about 100 coats because these guys sleep on the street. CNN: Why is what you do important today? Munoz: Because I have a family at my house and I have a second family out there. And that's about 130 to 140 guys. And there's always a line out there. And the economy is not good right now, and those who have a place to stay have to choose between a place to live and food. And when we're there they have something to eat. At least we provide a little something, and the only thing we ask in return is a smile. If you hand a meal to someone who hasn't eaten anything in the last 20 hours and they smile, you know you did something good. CNN: How much food do you cook in the space of a week? Munoz: In a week it's hard to say, but for example, tomorrow we're going to cook 22 pounds of rice, 15 pounds of pasta, 10 pounds of frozen vegetables, 10 pounds of onions, 8 to 10 pounds of peppers, 60 pounds of chicken, we do that through the oven. My mom, she's the one who creates the menu and every day we change the menu. CNN: What was it like to become a CNN Hero and what has your life been like since? Munoz: To become a CNN Hero, being nominated, it's a great honor for me, for my family and for my country [Colombia]. So they know -- I had the chance to be there for almost a month and when I went into a neighborhood and people knew, or even here in New York, people recognize me. And it helped me around the world. One example, there was a teacher in Afghanistan and she e-mailed me saying she wanted to start a small meal program in their town because of my story. And there was a little girl in Texas, I think she's 8, after CNN Heroes, she saw the show and the next weekend she went out with her friends and family and sold brownies and lemonade and made $25 and sent it to me with a note saying she was touched by my efforts. CNN: Are you planning on expanding your efforts beyond Queens? Munoz: Yeah, we already did. Right now, about a month ago, three volunteers they're doing breakfast in Brentwood and two small towns in Long Island. And in Elizabeth, New Jersey, they're starting a meal program and they're opening one in Miami with sandwiches and water. I'm with them and they're helping me out. CNN: You received the U.S. Citizen's Award from President Obama this year -- what was that like and what did that mean to you? Munoz: That was a great honor. A great honor. Why, because not that many people have a chance to go to the White House invited by the president of the United States. And he told me I did a great job and to continue doing what I'm doing. Today President Barack Obama wants to shake your hand and tell you not to give up your mission. CNN: Who is your biggest inspiration? Munoz: My mom. I always say my mom is my hero. Because she taught me how to share. She told me if you share you're OK with God. CNN: What would you say to people who are trying to figure out a way that they can give back to their community? Munoz: If you share, share anything you have you're not using like clothes, toys, share it to make other people happy. People in this country cook more than they need and two days later it goes from the refrigerator to the garbage. If you see someone standing on the corner and have $2, buy them a cup of coffee and a piece of bread. I'm doing it seven days a week, but just do it once in a while and you'll feel what I feel. And when that person is smiling at you you'll know you're doing something good. Do it from the inside. Share. Sharing is a beautiful thing. Think of me, I'm a regular union worker, bus driver and I'm trying to change the lives of the hungry. And imagine if everyone around the world got together to change the lives of the hungry. Imagine if they helped once in a while, you'd see a lot of change. So share, it's a beautiful thing.","Jorge Munoz is a bus driver who started delivering surplus food to the homeless .

"(CNN) -- Chelsea's attempt to make FA Cup history came to a halt on Saturday when the holders were eliminated from England's top knockout competition in a penalty shootout by Premier League rivals Everton. The London club, seeking to become the first to win the trophy three years in a row, were held 1-1 at home in the fourth-round replay despite going ahead in extra-time through England midfielder Frank Lampard. Leighton Baines forced the spot-kick showdown with a superb left-footed set-piece a minute from the end, but the defender looked to have handed Chelsea the advantage when Petr Cech saved his penalty. However, American goalkeeper Tim Howard kept out an effort by French striker Nicolas Anelka and then England defender Ashley Cole blazed his attempt over the crossbar, giving captain Phil Neville the chance to make it 4-3 and seal a last-16 clash with division two Reading on March 1. It was a big blow for Chelsea boss Carlo Ancelotti ahead of Tuesday's Champions League first-leg, last-16 tie away to Denmark's Copenhagen. ""We deserved to win. Obviously we are not happy, but we have to look forward, to use these days, the next days, to recover well, to recover energy and to prepare well,"" the Italian told reporters after his side's first home defeat against Everton since 1994. A historic first victory in Europe's top club competition seems like Chelsea's only real hopes of winning a trophy this season, with the Blues languishing in fifth place in their Premier League defense. Cup magic shared by cross-channel minnows . League leaders Manchester United were made to battle against non-league part-timers Crawley Town before reaching the last eight with a 1-0 home victory on Saturday. Wes Brown scored the only goal in the 28th minute, his first since 2008, as he headed home a well-worked short corner by Darron Gibson. The defender also made a vital late block on an attempted overhead kick by Matthew Tubbs as Crawley kept fighting for an equalizer and an unexpected replay, with striker Richard Brodie heading against the United bar in time added on. United boss Alex Ferguson started the match with several non-regulars, but brought star striker Wayne Rooney off the bench in the second half. Earlier, Premier League teams Stoke and Birmingham moved into the quarterfinals with 3-0 victories over third division Brighton and Sheffield Wednesday respectively. Stoke went through with first-half goals from strikers John Carew and Jon Walters and defender Ryan Shawcross. Chile winger Jean Beausejour and Obafemi Martins netted inside 20 minutes for Birmingham, the latter his first for the club since the Nigeria striker joined on loan last month, while defender David Murphy wrapped it up eight minutes after halftime. On Sunday, Manchester City host Notts County in a fourth-round replay, while in fifth-round matches Arsenal travel to another division three team Leyton Orient and Fulham take on Premier League rivals Bolton.","Two-time defending champions Chelsea knocked out of FA Cup in fourth-round replay .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- An Iraqi judge sentenced a British contractor to life in prison Monday, sparing him the death penalty. Daniel Fitzsimons, 30, was charged with murder in the 2009 shooting deaths of two colleagues in Baghdad, in the first trial of a Westerner in Iraq since the Iraq War started in 2003. He pleaded not guilty, telling a three-judge panel that he shot the two men in self-defense. The judge who sentenced him said he didn't give him the death penalty ""because you're still young and because of the circumstances of the crime,"" he said. Fitzsimons smiled and thanked the judge when he heard the verdict Monday. The victims were Paul McGuigan, a British national, and Darren Hoare, an Australian. Fitzsimons was also accused of the attempted murder of a guard. The Iraqi guard, Arkan Mahdi, was wounded. He has the right to claim compensation in civil court, the judge ruled. Iraqi judges are not named for security reasons. Fitzsimons's Iraqi lawyer, Tariq Harb, said he was ""very happy with the court decision."" But Salam Abdulkarim, who represents the families of the victims, said Fitzsimons had committed an ugly crime and according to Iraqi law, he should get the most extreme punishment. A spokesman with the British Embassy in Baghdad said it was a matter for Iraqi law. ""This was a decision made by the Iraqi court. We respect the independence of the Iraqi judicial system, the court verdict and the sentence,"" the spokesman said. Fitzsimons complained during the trial that the court would not let him talk about his post-traumatic stress disorder. The court issued two delays in order to get a health committee report on PTSD. Fitzsimons had previously been diagnosed with the disorder in Britain, but his lawyer had argued that the disorder was new to Iraq. The trial comes after security contractors lost their immunity following the U.S.-Iraq security agreement that went into effect in January 2009. Before that, Iraqis had complained that private security contractors were operating in a state of lawlessness, never held accountable by Iraqi authorities for incidents in which Iraqis were killed. According to Fitzsimons' testimony, after a night of drinking, he got into a fight with McGuigan that lasted on and off for more than an hour. He then left, but was later attacked by McGuigan and Hoare, and he shot them in self-defense, he told the court. At one point, one of the judges told him that his version didn't match some of the evidence. Under Iraqi law, murder is punishable by hanging.","NEW: The judge is lenient because of the youth of the killer and the circumstances .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Four members of a group of 31 North Koreans who accidentally crossed over into South Korean waters on a fishing boat, have decided to defect to the South, despite Pyongyang's demands that they all be repatriated to the North, the South Korean Red Cross said. The defection of the four North Koreans could spark tensions on the peninsula, where joint U.S.-South Korea military drills have kicked off this week. North Korea had threatened to engulf Seoul in a ""sea of flames,"" a day before the opening of the exercise. The South will return the remaining 27 members of the group through Panmunjom, a truce village on the ground border between the two sides, and send the fishing boat back through the waters in the West Sea on Friday, the Red Cross said. South Korea's intelligence agency questioned the North Koreans for almost a month since they crossed over in February before deciding to release the group, the aid agency said. There are currently more than 20,000 North Korean defectors in South Korea, according to the South's Unification Ministry. The number of annual defectors has risen dramatically since the turn of the century and continues to climb. Defectors who are forcefully repatriated to the North after attempting to cross over into third countries such as China, Mongolia or Southeast Asia are commonly sent to prison camps as a punishment. Many defectors who live in South Korea fear for the lives of their family or relatives who remain in the North.","A boat with a crew of 31 crosses into South Korean waters, the Red Cross says .

"(CNN) -- Top seed Francesca Schiavone suffered a shock first-round exit at the Malaysian Open on Monday, losing 2-6 7-6 (7-1) 6-4 to Australia's Jelena Dokic. Former world No. 4 Dokic had not beaten an opponent ranked in the world's top five since a victory over Belgium's Kim Clijsters in 2003. But the 27-year-old, currently ranked 91st, now has a 100% record in three career meetings with French Open champion Schiavone. The Italian looked on course to end that run after comfortably claiming the opening set in Kuala Lumpur. But 2002 Wimbledon semifinalist Dokic fought back to win a second-set tie break, which saw Schiavone require medical assistance after a fall, and eventually seal the match after one hour and 59 minutes. ""Sometimes when you see your opponent get injured you have to be a lot more focused so you don't drop your level,"" Dokic told the WTA website. ""You can't think that she will not play well. She went for some risky shots early in the rally, so I had to be ready for that. But I think I served really well in the third set. ""I already had a good tournament this year in Paris, I beat top-20 and top-25 players there. I had tough draws in Dubai and Doha and again here, so this is a big win for me."" Dokic will now face the winner of the clash between Japan's Kurumi Nara and Elena Bovina of Russia. Tuesday sees two more high-profile stars take to the court, as French second seed Marion Bartoli takes on Maria Elena Camerin. Also in action is three-time grand-slam finalist Dinara Safina, who faces Xinyun Han of China. Russia's former No. 1 has lost in the first round of all three tournaments she has played this year, most recently at the Australian Open in January, and has dropped to 113th in the rankings. Elsewhere, Juan Martin del Potro claimed his first title since winning the 2009 U.S. Open when he defeated Janko Tipsarevic in the final of the Delray Beach International Championships in Florida on Sunday. Del Potro, now 89th in the world, dropped as low as 485 in the rankings after suffering a serious wrist injury in 2010. His 6-4 6-4 win over the sixth-seeded Serbian capped a fine month, coming on the back of successive semifinal appearances in San Jose and Memphis.","Francesca Schiavone knocked out of the Malaysian Open by Jelena Dokic .

She is believed to be about five months pregnant and is married to Emile Decker, a member of the U.S. Army National Guard, who is currently serving in Afghanistan. The couple also has a 17-month-old son. ""The family is concerned and so are we,"" said Vince DiBenedetto, a sheriff's spokesman.

DiBenedetto said the vehicle offered no clues to her whereabouts. When her husband, Emile, was home on leave in January, the couple went to Hawaii to visit her father and then stayed with her grandparents in Maryland after they returned, DiBenedetto said. Emile Decker returned to Afghanistan the first week of February and some members of her family saw him off at the airport. Bethany Decker was not there, according to DiBenedetto.

"(CNN) -- Wisconsin protesters geared up for a third week of demonstrations on Monday as Democratic lawmakers were again missing from the state capitol, protesting a bill that would curb collective bargaining rights for most public workers. The state's 14 Democratic senators have fled to neighboring Illinois to prevent a quorum of 20 votes needed for a budget repair bill that would require public employees -- with the exception of police and firefighters -- to cover more of their retirement plans and health care premiums. Collective bargaining would be limited to wages, though any pay increases beyond the inflation rate would be subject to voter approval. ""There are plenty of states that do not have collective bargaining,"" Republican Gov. Scott Walker said Monday. ""We have a right to do this with the statutes and that's what we're doing."" Union leaders have agreed to pay more for benefits, but oppose restricting bargaining rights that the governor argues is needed for meaningful fiscal reforms. Wisconsin is ""broke,"" and unions use their power to block necessary cost-saving measures, Walker said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""It's about time somebody stood up and told the truth in this state, and said, 'Here's our problem, here's the solution,' and acted on it,"" he said. ""Because if we don't, we fail to make a commitment to the future."" Moments later on the program, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka assailed Walker. ""This isn't about the budget crisis,"" he said, adding that Walker's arguments have ""migrated"" as his justifications have been refuted. ""Governors that are willing to sit down and work with their employees can work out problems,"" Trumka said. ""We can solve them. But that's not what Governor Walker is doing. He says, 'I won't talk to you.' "" Wisconsin is confronted with a $137 million budget shortfall by June 30. The embattled governor has defended his budget repair bill, saying the measures are needed to head off a $3.6 billion budget gap by 2013 that could result in thousands of layoffs. The state had faced a suggested Friday deadline to balance the budget, but the crucial date is March 16, officials said. Meanwhile, some of the hundreds of demonstrators who had filled the Capitol building -- gathering inside the rotunda in daily protest of the proposed legislation -- had left the building by Monday at the request of state police, said Department of Administration spokeswoman Jodi Jensen. ""Of those who remained, all but a few have voluntarily complied with the request of law enforcement to remain in a designed area of the building,"" Jensen said. ""No additional protesters will be allowed into the building until this situation is resolved."" Hundreds gathered outside the Capitol building later on Monday, chanting, ""Let us in!"" Their yells were met by a group of protesters who remained inside, chanting, ""Let them in!"" Representative Peter Barca, the Democratic leader in Wisconsin's state assembly, called the lock-down unacceptable. ""Politicians may not always enjoy hearing what the citizens of this state have to say, but it is wrong to block elected officials from their constituents,"" Barca said. ""There are a number of scheduled meetings in the building today and the public has a right to attend them and visit their legislators."" A pro-union political action committee called ""Defending Wisconsin"" filed a lawsuit Monday in a U.S. District Court against the state of Wisconsin for not letting people to enter the capitol building, said the group's director Jeremy J. Ryan. Authorities had initially given demonstrators until late Sunday afternoon to leave the building, saying it needed to be cleaned after roughly two weeks of protests. ""We're going through an extensive cleaning process tonight,"" Wisconsin Capitol Police Chief Charles Tubbs said late Sunday. ""We're hoping to get through that."" And while many people left, others defied the order and remained inside. Some said they were willing to risk arrest in a conflict that has become a flash point in the nation's debate around labor unions. The budget bill was passed by assembly lawmakers early Friday and must now clear the Senate, where absent Democrats have stalled the legislative process while awaiting a compromise outside state borders. Walker has called on the lawmakers to ""come back and do their job,"" sending state patrol officers to Democrat homes in an effort to pressure their return. ""If we fail to pass this bill by Tuesday, we lose $165 million worth of savings. If we continue down that path we start seeing layoffs,"" he warned. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers told CNN Sunday that workers in Wisconsin have sent a message to Walker that ""'we understand and we will do our fair share.'"" But Walker is sending a different message, Weingarten said: ""'I'm just taking away your voice at work.'"" In the long term, that message ""is ridiculous because collective bargaining is the way to increase quality,"" she said. President Barack Obama also weighed in on Monday, appearing to allude to the growing controversy by telling a group of governors that while ""everybody should be prepared to give up something"" in the face of new budget realities, ""I don't think it does anybody any good when public employees are vilified"" or their rights are infringed upon. While the president has publicly expressed support for those fighting to keep collective bargaining in Wisconsin, he has not joined them at protests. Walker's spokesman, Cullen Werwie, quickly responded, calling the president's comments a ""misunderstanding."" ""I'm sure the President knows that the average federal worker pays twice as much for health insurance as what we are asking for in Wisconsin,"" Werwie said in a written statement. Trumka of the AFL-CIO insisted that Obama, who faces federal budget challenges, is ""doing it the right way."" ""He's not taking on workers like Scott Walker is and trying to take away their ability to come together and negotiate a middle-class way of life,"" Trumka said. Walker is expected to give the state's annual budget address to a joint session of the state legislature Tuesday at 4 p.m. (5 p.m.ET). But the showdown over budgets and bargaining rights is not limited to the Badger State. In Indiana, Democratic lawmakers -- much like those from Wisconsin -- remained in Illinois on Monday, extending the . stalemate over a Republican-backed proposal they say will restrict workers' rights. Republican house members claim they have scrapped a ""right-to-work"" bill that would have prevented private-sector unions from requiring workers to pay dues for representation. But Indiana Democrats are skeptical. ""You'll forgive us if we don't take them at their word,"" said party spokesman John Schorg. ""We were out (of the state) today and chances are we will be out tomorrow."" Schorg said negotiations between Republicans and Democrats had come to a virtual stand-still Monday. The state's Republican governor, Mitch Daniels -- who ended collective bargaining with public unions soon after his election in 2005 -- has defended the bill as necessary cost-cutting measure. The former budget director under George W. Bush, Daniels  -- who is often described as a potential 2012 presidential candidate -- may now be facing a more difficult task in scaling back the negotiating rights of private unions. The state assembly met on Monday, but lacked the two-thirds quorum needed to pass legislation. Lawmakers face a April 29 deadline to balance the state budget, officials said. In Ohio, a budget bill supported by another GOP governor, John Kasich, prompted thousands of labor-backed demonstrators to descend on Columbus to protest a proposal that would curtail union bargaining rights. Senate Republicans, who command a 23-10 majority -- currently lack enough votes to pass another controversial budget bill affecting public workers. The proposal, known as Senate Bill 5, would prevent employees from negotiating health care, pensions and automatic pay raises based on seniority. The measure would also ban strikes for all public workers -- rather than just those involved in public safety -- but was recently amended to allow state employees to negotiate salaries, according to state Sen. Shannon Jones. ""We can't sustain the contracts that have clogged up the arteries of government for the last 30 years,"" said Jason Mauk, a spokesman for the Ohio Senate Majority Caucus. ""We're allowing unions to negotiate terms that should be the employers' decision."" Mauk said Republican lawmakers view the measure as ""long-term reform to restructure state government."" He says its an effort to ""trim around the edges to make government leaner and more efficient."" But opposition groups say the bill is anti-union. Crowds of union supporters -- who last week surrounded the state capitol chanting, ""Kill the Bill"" -- are expected to again board Columbus-bound buses in protest of the measure on Tuesday. Democrats had refused to put forth a single amendment after lawmakers described the proposal as ""fatally flawed."" The next senate hearing on the measure is set to begin Tuesday at 1p.m. (2p.m.ET).

"Beijing (CNN) -- China rejected American criticism of its treatment of journalists Tuesday, two days after several foreign reporters, including CNN staff, were manhandled by Chinese security forces. ""As far as I understand, journalists did not follow relevant procedures in advance of Sunday. Police were there to provide reasonable guidance,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu said Tuesday. ""China protects foreign journalists' lawful rights within the law,"" she said, adding that the ministry hopes ""journalists understand that it takes two sides -- both the government and the journalists -- to understand each other, and patiently handle the situation."" The U.S. ambassador to China said Monday that American and other foreign journalists were ""illegally detained or harassed as they attempted to do their jobs"" while covering protests in downtown Beijing over the weekend. Ambassador Jon Huntsman Jr. said in a statement that one reporter was ""severely beaten and detained for many hours."" ""I call on the Chinese government to hold the perpetrators accountable for harassing and assaulting innocent individuals and ask that they respect the rights of foreign journalists to report in China,"" he said. Journalists including CNN's Eunice Yoon and Jo Ling Kent were physically harassed by Chinese security Sunday as they planned to cover a protest -- which never took place, perhaps because of heavy police presence. They were shoved, dragged and at times carried away from the scene. Their cameras were confiscated and footage was deleted, and a press card was taken away from Yoon, who wrested it back from an officer who refused to give his name. ""We found out many other journalists were treated the same and, in some cases, much worse,"" Yoon wrote. ""A former colleague and friend of mine, Steve Engle of Bloomberg News, had been dragged into an alley by several police who beat him up. He ended up at the hospital."" The heavy security was a response to a second weekend in a row of anonymous calls by organizers for a pro-democracy demonstration in Beijing. Hundreds of Chinese police officers along with more than 120 vehicles flooded Beijing's central pedestrian shopping area, Wangfujing, on Sunday, around the site of a second attempted ""jasmine"" rally inspired by pro-democracy protests in Tunisia. There was no sign of protest as the police deployed unusual tactics to prevent demonstrations.","Journalists and the government must see each others' point of view, the foreign ministry says .

"(CNN) -- Talking to the Taliban leader in Afghanistan may help bring peace to the country, according to a former Pakistan spy chief once referred to as the ""father of the Taliban."" Retired Gen. Hamid Gul, a former head of the ISI spy agency, worked with the CIA through the 1980s to fund and train the Afghan Jihad against the Soviets. Many of the Mujahedeen went on to govern Afghanistan as the Taliban, who are led by Mullah Omar. ""The best situation would be to talk to Mullah Omar,"" Gul said. ""But then, put up your own conditions where I would say it is legitimate ... I think they will accept. I know their psychology."" Face-to-face talks would work best, Gul added. ""You have to engage him. You have to talk to him,"" Gul said. ""There is no one else, for heaven sake, why beat around the bush?"" Last year, Gul said Omar was the only person who can improve U.S. interests in Afghanistan. ""Mullah Omar, nobody else,"" Gul said. He insisted that President Barack Obama's administration can access Omar through the Pakistan military. But the Pakistani Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) denied that the Pakistani military is in contact with Omar and that it can bring him and other commanders to the negotiating table. In his latest interview, Gul decried the terrorist label on the Taliban, saying former President George W. Bush was wrong to call them that. ""This is wrong, by any definition,"" he said. ""No shred of evidence is available that they were involved in any terrorist activity."" Last year, Gul said a stated Taliban condition to any discussions -- the complete withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan first -- was not a fixed demand. With concessions from Washington, it could be softened and make way for negotiations to begin, he said. Afghan President Hamid Karzai has said he will pursue talks with the Taliban as part of a reconciliation and reintegration plan. Karzai has said he plans to buy off low-level Taliban foot soldiers with cash and make peace with some Taliban leaders by offering them government positions. While Washington supports the plan, it rejects a dialogue involving Omar. The Taliban has said Omar is not interested in a peace deal.

"(CNN) -- Texas firefighters were making significant progress Tuesday against wildfires that have consumed at least 78 homes and, at their peak, were burning the length of a football field every minute. Sustained winds of 40 mph, gusting to 60, combined with 2% relative humidity in some areas to cause the grass fire conflagration Sunday, said Mark Stanford, chief of fire operations for the Texas Forest Service. On Tuesday, however, firefighters had all 21 remaining fires at least 50 percent contained, Stanford told CNN Radio. Crews want to have them fully contained by Thursday, he said. ""Friday will be another bad day for us,"" Stanford said. ""Not as bad as Sunday, but it will be a very high fire danger day across that region. So we want to make sure that we've freed up all of our fire resources so that they can respond to new starts we may have."" As of Tuesday, 78 homes had been reported destroyed, and that number is expected to increase as teams fan out to inspect damages, Stanford said. None of the fires were threatening communities. Smoke from one fire caused an accident that killed a 5-year-old child Sunday on Interstate 20. Officials believe many of the fires were started by power lines that fell from high winds. Officials are urging citizens to be very cautious with their outdoor activities on fire danger days. One fire was caused by an individual grinding on metal pipe, Stanford said. A blaze in Midland was caused when a vehicle tire blew and the tire rim created sparks. Since Sunday, forestry officials, who were called in to assist local fire departments, have responded to 71 fires covering 136,699 acres, the Texas Forest Service said on its website. Most of the fires were across the Texas Panhandle. The fires occurred in an area of about 45,000 square miles, the size of Kentucky, Stanford said. Two of the biggest active fires were in Randall County, where 26 homes were lost, and Potter County, where 29 homes were lost. Those fires were 80% and 25% contained, respectively. Both were expected to be completely contained by day's end, Stanford said. Potter County Sheriff Brian Thomas said a 61,000-acre fire in his county was ignited when a man cut pipe with a metal grinder in high wind Sunday. Austin Lynn Stephens, 52, was arrested and charged with criminal trespass because he was on private property when he was using the grinder. Firefighters battled blazes in a dozen other counties, including a 35,000-acre fire in Matador West in Motley County, and a 21,000-acre fire in Andrews County, officials said Monday. They also fought fires in the counties of Haskell, Tom Green, Randall, Howard, Midland, Scurry, Motley, Crockett, Mitchell and Eastland. One wildfire destroyed a dog kennel near Amarillo, Capt. Wes Hall of the Amarillo Fire Department said. Authorities were trying to account Monday for the animals missing or dead after the fire tore through the Willow Creek Kennel. Firefighters were able to open cages to free at least some of the dogs before the flames overtook the facility. As many as 27 homes were destroyed in the area and ""the fire was on the kennel in a matter of minutes,"" employee Chance Smith said, adding he did not have an exact number of dogs lost. In the community of Matador, north of Lubbock, families could do nothing but watch as their homes burned to the ground. Juan and Rosemary Segovia hadn't been gone 20 minutes when they returned to a panic-stricken neighborhood and found they had lost everything they owned. ""To know everything you worked so hard for, it's all gone,"" a tearful Juan Segovia told CNN affiliate KCBD. He and his wife stared in disbelief at the blaze. The family of seven is without a home, but grateful for what was not lost. ""I'm glad our family wasn't home when it happened,"" Rosemary Segovia said before falling into her husband's arms. ""That's all I care about is I have my family.""

"(CNN) -- The United Nations on Monday accused Belarus of defying an arms embargo against Ivory Coast by delivering three attack helicopters to the disputed president of the West African nation. A spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that the helicopters and other related materiel ""are reportedly being delivered at Yamoussoukro,"" the nation's capital, for Laurent Gbagbo's forces. Ban is pushing for an urgent meeting of the U.N. Security Council on the matter, the spokesman said. ""The first delivery arrived reportedly on a flight which landed this (Sunday) evening and additional flights are scheduled for Monday,"" the spokesman said in a statement. U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky said Monday afternoon that U.N. officials on the ground in Ivory Coast were unable to confirm whether the delivery was made, saying they were forced to withdraw from the airport before they were able to verify the report. U.N. officials later said that the team sent to investigate the possible breach of sanctions was fired upon Monday by local security forces in the Ivory Coast. Gbagbo, the nation's incumbent leader, is clinging to the presidency despite an international call for him to step down after an electoral commission declared challenger Alassane Ouattara the winner of a November election. The deliveries violate an arms embargo that has been in place since 2004, Ban's spokesman said. Andrei Savinykh, a spokesman for the Belarusian Foreign Ministry, vehemently denied the allegation, calling it part of a campaign of ""lies and slander"" against Belarus. A ""destructive information attack is being carried out"" against Belarus, said Savinykh, according to the Belarus state-run Belta news agency. Violence in Ivory Coast escalated sharply over the past week, after four African heads of state left Abidjan. They had been given a mandate by the African Union to find a ""binding solution"" to the post-election crisis in Ivory Coast. Gbagbo and Ouattara supporters have clashed in the central cities, Yamoussoukro and Daoukro, in addition to ongoing fighting in Abidjan. Ouattara is holed up in the Golf hotel in Abidjan under the protection of U.N. peacekeepers.

"(CNN) -- Authorities imposed curfews and limited access to city centers across Iraq as thousands of protesters demanded economic progress and an end to corruption, police said. Demonstrators were reported to be gathering in Baghdad, Basra, Nineveh, Anbar and Salaheddin. The developments follow weeks of demonstrations across the country by protesters angry about unemployment, poor basic services, corruption and a lack of freedom. At least 13 people died in protests on February 25. ""Liar, liar, Nuri al-Maliki,"" some protesters were heard shouting in Baghdad.  ""Al-Maliki has become like Saddam,"" others said, referring to former leader Saddam Hussein. ""We have elected you to protect us and not to kill us,"" one banner said.

"(CNN) -- Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker on Thursday warned 14 absent lawmakers trying to stall his controversial budget bill to return to the state Capitol immediately to vote on the measure, or layoff notices will be sent to 1,500 public employees before the weekend. ""Unfortunately, if we don't have action by tomorrow we have a legal and moral obligation to start forewarning people,"" Walker said a Thursday night press conference. The layoffs would take effect April 1, the governor said. Walker's threat to start laying off workers capped the third week of a high-stakes drama playing out in Wisconsin. Meanwhile, a Dane County judge on Thursday issued an order barring demonstrators from the state Capitol after business hours. During protests, some demonstrators have been sleeping inside the building. The order from Wisconsin Circuit Court Judge John Albert gave the state Department of Administration the authority to forcibly remove anyone who refuses. Most of the protesters remaining at the Capitol Thursday evening appeared to abide by the judge's order. Some initially balked at the demand they leave the Capitol by the building's regular 6 p.m. closing time. However, a long line of demonstrators later filed out of the building chanting slogans, carrying bedrolls and banging homemade plastic drums. Concerns about safety risks arising from the nonstop presence of demonstrators at the Capitol  were heightened Thursday with the discovery of  41 rounds of hollow-point rifle ammunition found outside the building. Police continued their search for more ammunition, and the person to which it belongs, amid a contentious budget showdown over a measure that would -- among other things -- curb the collective bargaining rights of most state workers. Walker has repeatedly said the collective bargaining provisions of his bill are not negotiable. The governor showed little sign of backing down from that stance Thursday night. Instead, Walker repeatedly said he was ""frustrated"" by the intransigence of the 14 Democratic senators trying to stymie the bill by not showing up to vote. He blamed a core group of ""extreme"" dissenters for standing in the way of compromise. ""What's probably the most frustrating is I keep getting the sense that many of these responsible senators are seeking a pathway home, however some of the more extreme members of that caucus are putting up a barrier to them,"" Walker said. Walker refused to name any of the senators he believes are blocking negotiations. The governor said he and Republican House Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald have been trying to negotiate with some Democrats. Walker refused to talk about what ""specifics are on the table."" Weeks of demonstrations in protest of Gov. Scott Walker's proposal have drawn massive crowds to the state legislature since mid-February, contributing to $6.5 million in damages and other costs, state Administration Secretary Mike Huebsch said during a hearing Thursday. The hearing examined the question of public access to the building. Meanwhile, the state Senate approved a resolution that would hold absentee Democratic lawmakers ""in contempt of the Senate"" should they not return to the Capitol by late afternoon. The missing lawmakers -- who left February 17 -- had still not returned by Thursday night. The contempt measure allows state law enforcement to detain and return the 14 Senate Democrats to Wisconsin, according to Senate Majority Leader spokesman Andrew Welhouse. Walker said he would prefer that the absent senators return of their own accord. ""I personally am going to ... try and compel these senators to come back in terms of making an offer,"" Walker said. The lawmakers fled to Illinois to prevent a quorum for voting on the state's budget repair bill, which would limit collective bargaining to wages and require public workers, with the exception of police and firefighters, to cover more of their retirement plans and health care premiums. But whether the contempt measure is constitutional remains unclear. The state Constitution prohibits the arrest of lawmakers while the legislature is in session, except for ""treason, felony and breach of the peace."" Whether Wisconsin law enforcement would be permitted jurisdiction in Illinois to detain the missing Democrats is also unclear. The stalemate has proven increasingly contentious in recent days as Senate lawmakers adopted a resolution on Wednesday that would fine absentee lawmakers $100 every day they remain missing. A similar resolution passed a day later in Indiana, where House Republicans imposed a $250-a-day fine against AWOL Democrats who -- like their Wisconsin counterparts -- fled to Illinois in protest of a labor bill. In Wisconsin, Republicans need a single Democrat to cross party lines and rejoin the 33-member legislature to meet the quorum of 20 lawmakers required in a vote on state fiscal matters. Only 17 lawmakers are required for most other issues. Union leaders have agreed to pay more for benefits, but view restricting bargaining rights as an assault on workers' rights. Gov. Walker took to the airwaves Wednesday in support of his belt-tightening measure. ""Every day we fail to act on this just adds more and more to the cost,"" he told reporters, defending the curtailing of collective bargaining as an integral part of fiscal reform. Wisconsin is confronted with a looming $137 million shortfall at the end of the fiscal year, June 30. The state faces a $3.6 billion budget gap by 2013.

"(CNN) -- More than 20% of patients who received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator -- a high-tech device that produces electrical impulses to regulate heartbeats and prevent life-threatening arrhythmias -- in recent years were not good candidates to receive the device, a new study suggests. Researchers at Duke University looked at more than 111,000 patients who received ICD implants between 2006 and 2009. More than 25,000 of those patients did not meet evidence-based criteria for receiving the device, according to the study. The risk of dying in the hospital was significantly higher for patients who received the ICD but did not meet the criteria, and 1 out of 121 patients in this category experienced complications following the implant, the study found. According to Dr. Sana Al-Khatib, lead researcher of the study published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, ICDs often are recommended as a primary prevention tactic for patients who are at high risk for a cardiac arrest or life-threatening arrhythmia, but who have not yet suffered from these symptoms. However, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, has issued a ""decision memo"" stating that only people having certain serious heart conditions or cardiac histories are suitable candidates for ICDs. The memo further states that patients must meet numerous other qualifications relating to clinical trials and not have certain serious diseases or conditions that would lower the implant's efficacy or the patient's likelihood of long-term survival. Dr. Ralph Brindis, president of the American College of Cardiology, said in a statement that the Duke University findings will have ""major implications."" ""The study indicates that there are substantial variations among hospital ICD implantation strategies,"" Brindis said. ""This variation clearly demonstrates an opportunity for improvement in care."" Dr. Robert Michler, chairman of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery at Montefiore-Einstein Heart Center, said the data should act as a ""wake-up call"" for physicians, surgeons and patients. ""Doctors are well-intentioned, but not all doctors should be determining the use of what is a very sophisticated therapy,"" Michler says. He says that in this case electophysiologists should be making the final determination if the patient needs the device. Even with the current guidelines, Al-Khatib said, some patients may fall into a gray zone and that each physician needs to use clinical judgment to make recommendations. ""Deviating from the guideline are acceptable in various circumstances,"" she said. ""But 20% is a significant amount of deviation."" Al-Khatib found that many patients who were being implanted with the ICDs had recently experienced arrhythmias or cardiac arrests. She said the time factor might explain the study's finding of an increase in deaths among implant patients who did not meet CMS criteria. ""These patients were sicker to begin with. They were in a period where they were more prone to complications,"" Al-Khatib said. ""The physicians haven't had the time to optimize the patients' medical therapy before subjecting them to this surgery."" Another possible explanation for the higher incidence of death might have been be whether the cardiologists who performed the implant were electrophysiologists. These specialists have additional training in the diagnosis and treatment of abnormal heart rhythms and were less likely to implant an ICD in a patient who did not meet evidence-based criteria, the study found.","A federal health agency has a set of guidelines for evaluating implant candidates .

"(CNN) -- An Indiana infant who was denied a life-saving transplant surgery by Medicaid will now have his operation paid for. MDwise, Inc. and AmeriHealth Mercy of Indiana announced Friday that they will cover six-month-old Seth Petreikis' thymus tissue transplant after Medicaid denied his parents original claim. Two appeals to the state's Family and Social Service Administration had also been denied. This decision comes after media reports of Seth's plight. After having an open heart surgery at about 2 ½ weeks, doctors diagnosed Seth with Complete DiGeorge Syndrome, a rare disease that leaves him with no immune system. Dr. M. Louise Market pioneered the surgery at Duke Hospital in North Carolina -- the only doctor at the only hospital in the United States that performs the surgery. Duke Hospital has done 60 thymus transplants in patients with DiGeorge Syndrome, and approximately 75% of them survived. Without this transplant, Seth would face serious infections that would surely end his life. Tim and Becky Petreikis from Dyer, Indiana, were told the cost of the surgery would be $350,000 to $500,000 -- a cost they told CNN they could not afford. Seth's health care is covered by Indiana Medicaid, but this treatment was originally denied because the surgery was considered experimental. Investigational treatments are not covered by Medicaid. ""Based on Seth's unique and compelling story, we believe making a compassionate allowance in this case is appropriate,"" said Caroline Carney Doebbeling, the MDwise chief medical officer, in a press release. MDwise chief marketing officer Jamie Bruce told CNN in a telephone interview that instance likes this don't happen often. ""It is a rare thing. We have not had a case this unique before. This is the first instance in the state of Indiana that someone has had this condition,"" Bruce said. Bruce said that MDwise came to a decision to cover Seth's transplant mid-day Friday. Seth's father said that MDWise called his wife Becky directly Friday afternoon and told her that their son's surgery would be covered. Petreikis said she was so happy she just started crying. ""I am so, so, so grateful,"" he said, adding that he is beyond excited. ""The thing that makes America great is we pull together when others are in need,"" the father said. The family set up a website and bank account asking for donations to help them afford Seth's surgery. After only two days, $150,000 was raised. The Petreikises told CNN that because Seth's surgery is covered in full now, all of the money will be going to a foundation to get the procedure deemed non-experimental so that other families and children can be helped. They added that they are overwhelmed with gratitude and thankful to the state of Indiana. Seth's father said that Seth will have heart surgery in February to have a shunt replaced. After recovering, he will go to North Carolina where he will hopefully have his thymus transplant by April.","Medicaid denied coverage for Seth Petreikis' surgery .

"(CNN) -- German car manufacturer Mercedes completed a takeover of the rebranded Brawn GP Formula One team on Monday, after its parent company Deimler acquired all remaining shares from team principal Ross Brawn and his management partners. In collaboration with its largest shareholder Aabar, Deimler purchased the remaining 24.9% of the team, which is now known as Mercedes GP. German corporation Deimler initially bought a 45.1% share of the team when it was called Brawn GP in November 2009, and that stake has now risen to 60%. Aabar, a global investment company owned by the Abu Dhabi government, now owns 40% of Mercedes GP. ""Daimler and Aabar's acquisition of the remaining 24.9% stake will be a further step in the consolidation and strengthening of our team for the future,"" Brawn told the official F1 website. ""I remain fully committed to our team for the long-term, along with the management team and all of our employees. We all look forward to the challenge of making our team successful, and proudly representing Mercedes-Benz."" The Brawn GP team competed in the elite motorsport for only one season, after the completion of a management buyout of the Honda Racing team in February 2009. The 2009 season was a huge success for the British-based team, as they clinched the constructors' title as well as the drivers' championship through British racer Jenson Button. The team was renamed Mercedes GP for the 2010 campaign, and achieved a fourth-place finish in the constructors' standings. The German duo of seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher and 25-year-old Nico Rosberg will once again race for the team in 2011. Elsewhere, last year's double world champions Red Bull have announced a sponsorship deal with luxury carmaker Infiniti. The Japanese manufacturer, which is parented by Nissan, has a marketing agreement with the British-based marque which will cover the 2011 and 2012 seasons. Infiniti's logo will now be present on Red Bull's new RB7 car and their drivers' overalls. Team principal Christian Horner hailed the new deal and said the agreement will have both commercial and technical benefits for Red Bull. ""The technical wealth and resources that Infiniti have at their disposal through Nissan is quite phenomenal,"" Horner told CNN. ""As an independent team, it was the one piece that Red Bull previously didn't have compared to the likes of Ferrari and Mercedes. So for us, it's important as a technology partner and a commercial partner."" German driver Sebastian Vettel became the youngest-ever winner of the drivers' championship for Red Bull in 2010, and the 23-year-old will begin the defense of his crown at the Australian Grand Prix on March 27.","Mercedes have completed their takeover of the F1 team formerly known as Brawn GP .

"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- One week after being shot through the head, U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords is off the ventilator and breathing on her own through a tracheotomy tube, the University Medical Center of Tucson, Arizona, said Saturday. Giffords, who authorities say was the target of a mass shooting by Jared Lee Loughner that left six dead and another 13 wounded, remains in critical condition. Still, in a statement, the southern Arizona hospital said that her recovery ""continues as planned."" Another person wounded in the incident, 58-year-old James Tucker, was released from the hospital Saturday, according to the medical center. Two other victims are in good condition at the hospital, while others wounded had been treated and released earlier this week. The Giffords' development is the latest milestone for a woman who was critically wounded after a bullet went into her skull, through her brain and then back out her skull. Doctors on Saturday morning replaced the breathing tube that ran down her throat with a tracheotomy tube in her windpipe. That procedure protects Giffords' airway and allows her to breath independently for the first time since her first surgery after the shooting, the medical center said. A feeding tube was also inserted earlier Saturday into Giffords, to make it easier for her to get needed nutrients. The hospital said that such procedures are ""not uncommon"" among intensive care patients suffering serious brain injuries. Police say that a gunman -- who they claim is Loughner, a 22-year-old Tucson resident -- killed several others in a Safeway parking lot in Tucson while trying to assassinate Giffords, who was then holding a constituent meeting. A law enforcement source said Saturday that Loughner had photographed himself posing with a 9mm handgun while wearing a red G-string. It's not clear when the photo was taken, but it was among those on a roll of 35 mm film that Loughner dropped off at a Walgreen's store in the hours before the shooting rampage. The Safeway where the shooting ocurred reopened Saturday morning for the first time since the incident. Store officials made a public address announcement inviting those who were in the store to step outside for the observation shortly after 10 a.m. MT (12 p.m. ET). Some in the crowd approached flower-bedecked barricades marking the scene and placed flowers. One woman, comforted by another in a green Safeway store apron, sobbed as she attempted to place a lighted candle and a handmade card reading, ""God Loves You."" A wreath was placed at the site to honor the victims, Safeway spokeswoman Susan Houghton said. Damage to the store has been completely repaired, she said. Dr. Michael Lemole, the hospital's chief of neurosurgery, said Friday that Giffords is ""beginning to carry out a more complex sequence"" of activity. ""We're confident (Giffords) is making progress now,"" he said. ""We couldn't have hoped for anything better given the severity of (her) injury."" In a Friday Twitter post, Giffords' husband, NASA astronaut Mark Kelly, thanked his ""great followers"" for their support. ""GG has been improving each day,"" he said. Those killed in last Saturday's attack included a 9-year-old girl, Christina Green; Arizona's chief federal judge, John Roll; and Gabe Zimmerman, a Giffords staffer. Meanwhile, the investigation into the attack continued as authorities on Friday released a detailed timeline of Loughner's activity in the hours before the shooting. A day earlier, they found a bag that is believed to belong to Loughner and contains the same kind of ammunition as was used in the massacre. DNA testing on the bag, which contained seven boxes of 9mm ammunition, could take up to 10 days before the results are determined, according to Pima County Sheriff's Department Capt. Chris Nanos. CNN's Alan Silverleib, Bill Mears, Ted Barrett, Steve Dolce, Susan Candiotti, Greg Morrison and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","NEW: Giffords is off the ventilator and breathing on her own, the hospital says .

"(CNN) -- Espanyol suffered a setback in their quest for European Champions League football on Monday as they surrendered a one-goal lead to lose 2-1 at home to Mallorca. The Barcelona-based team currently occupy fifth position in Spain's La Liga and they took the lead against their tenth placed opponents when striker Alvaro Vasquez converted Jose Callejon's pass. The match was level after 63 minutes when Cameroon forward Pierre Webo finished from a Sergio Tejera cross. Michael Laudrup's Mallorca ensured they would move up to tenth place in the table when 23-year-old Emilio Nsue grabbed his fourth goal of the season with just seven minutes remaining. The result means Mauricio Pochettino's Espanyol stay fifth, seven points behind Villarreal in the fourth and final Champions League place. Sevilla closed within two points of Espanyol after a comfortable 3-0 home win over Sporting Gijon. Goals from Luis Fabiano, Diego Perotti and Alvaro Negredo edged them into seventh, level on points with Athletic Bilbao.

"(CNN) -- The number of people missing after flash floods swept cars off roads in the eastern Australian city of Toowoomba rose to more than 70 on Monday, with eight people confirmed dead, police in the state of Queensland reported. The latest flooding hit Toowoomba, about 125 kilometers (80 miles) west of the state capital Brisbane and considerably south of other areas hit by recent floods. The Queensland Police Service confirmed that 72 people are now missing in the areas of Toowoomba and Lockyer Creek, and Chantelle Rule-Murphy, spokesperson for Emergency Management Queensland, said eight people have now been confirmed dead. iReport: Are you there? Share your photos, video . Toowoomba is the biggest inland city in Queensland, a region that was already reeling from one of the worst floods in its history. Authorities there are conducting several search-and-rescue operations, and Australia's military has committed four helicopters to those efforts, Rule-Murphy said. ""A lot of places are in high alert and we still expect a good deal of rain, so we are still not out of the woods yet,"" Queensland police spokesman Ben Tracy said. Since November 30, the seasonal flooding in Queensland has caused rivers to spill over their banks and reach record levels. At least 200,000 people have been affected, and heavy rains are expected to continue moving into Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- Lasith Malinga became the first bowler to claim a hat-trick of dismissals in two Cricket World Cups as his devastating spell of bowling helped Sri Lanka dismantle Kenya. Malinga took six wickets for just 38 runs including three in three balls as he became the second bowler in as many days to record a hat-trick at the tournament after West Indies' paceman Kemar Roach's feat against Netherlands on Monday. Minnows Kenya had no answer to his fierce spell of bowling, capitulating to 142 all out in Colombo before the hosts lost only one batsman as they recorded a  nine wicket victory in just 18 overs. Kenya captain Jimmy Kamande won the toss and elected to bat but openers Maurice Ouma and Seren Waters fell before eight runs were on the board. Brothers Collins and David Obuya steadied the ship and despite riding their luck both recorded half centuries as Kenya edged to 102-2. Collins reached 52 before he was bowled by Malinga and brother David soon followed, caught by Thilan Samaraweera off the bowling of Muttiah Muralitharan for 51. That was the end of Kenya's resistance as they lost their last five wickets for just 15 runs with Malinga their chief tormentor. The first victim of his hat-trick was Tanmay Mishra, trapped LBW by a dipping yorker before Peter Ongondo's middle stump was removed by a similar delivery, traveling at 144 km per hour. Malinga secured his second World Cup treble with another vicious yorker that clattered into Shem Ngoche's stumps. Just a few balls later Malinga claimed his sixth victim as he bowled Elijah Otieno to end Kenya's innings on 142. Sri Lanka wasted no time recording victory as Upul Tharanga smashed an unbeaten 67 and put on 72 with Tilkeratne Dilshan, before he was caught by Maurice Ouma off the bowling of Otieno. Captain Kumar Sangakkara hit a quick 27 not out off just 24 balls to seal a comprehensive victory for Sri Lanka, who bounced back in style after their defeat by Pakistan. But the co-hosts will undoubtedly face a much stiffer test in their next match when they face defending champions Australia on Saturday.","Lasith Malinga takes a hat-trick against Kenya at Cricket World Cup .

"(CNN) -- It seems no-one in South Africa can fail to be gripped by World Cup football fever. The running, tackling, shooting, offside-appealing proof comes with a clutch of grannies who have been playing in a fiercely competitive league around the Nkowankowa township, 600 kilometers north of Johannesburg. A squad of 35 nans down domestic duties twice a week to take to the field for their team Vakhegula Vakhegula, and compete against seven other teams in the region. Some of them even credit the beautiful game as having turned their lives around. ""I like to play soccer because it helps,"" said Nari Baloyi, who at 47-years-old, clocks in as one of the youngest players. ""We were sick, but now our temperatures, our blood pressures... have gone down ...even our doctors are amazed when we go for a check-up."" One of the more elderly members, Nora Makhubela, is convinced that football has given her a new lease of life following the setback of suffering six strokes. ""My life has really changed...if I were to run with you I would beat you even though I'm much older,"" she said, throwing down the gauntlet to the likes of Ronaldo, Messi et al. ""My life has improved because of the football. I wish God could bless the person who came up with this great idea."" The women contribute around $1 a month each for footballs, kit, and travel to the bi-annual regional tournament. Dozens of noisy fans cheer on the players, with the distinctive sound of the vuvuzelas -- a South African trumpet -- creating an atmosphere that would be welcome at any European Champions League tie. Makhubela is hoping her new-found love of the game extends long enough for her to be able to watch some of the matches when the World Cup begins in June. ""I pray every day to God to keep me alive until 2010. I would really love to watch the games,"" she said. The team was formed three years ago to offer older women a chance to exercise and come together as a group, says community worker Beka Ntsanwisi. ""Some of them couldn't even walk properly and if they did something in their free time they would be knitting or sewing and sitting all the time...here they run, shout, fight with you...it keeps them young,"" she said. David Maake said his job coaching the team is the best he's ever had. ""With young boys you need more money to achieve many things...here, I may come with my stress...but I will laugh so much until I forget everything,"" he said. The team have even suggested they play a curtain raiser for the main event itself, a brainwave the footballing authorities have said they will give serious thought to. If the women do manage to take part as an hors d'oeuvre to the World Cup proper one thing is for sure, what they lack in skill they will make up for in enthusiasm.","Grannies in a South African township have taken up football .

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States is weighing a possible military role to help the Libyan revolt against leader Moammar Gadhafi, but top U.S. officials warn that the issue is controversial. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told a Senate panel Wednesday that ""there may well be a role for military assets to get equipment and supplies into areas that have a need for them"" and in areas where the United States is welcome. But she noted the Arab League statement issued Wednesday that rejected ""any foreign interference within Libya on behalf of the opposition, even though they have called for Gadhafi to leave."" ""The tough issues about how and whether there would be any intervention to assist those who are opposing Libya is very controversial within Libya and within the Arab community,"" Clinton told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ""So we are working closely with our partners and allies to try to see what we can do and we are engaged in very active consideration of all the different options that are available."" Two senior officials in the Arab League said the group's members have agreed not to accept any foreign intervention in Libya; they also agreed that they will consult with other Arab League members in order to protect Libyans' security. But the league cannot ignore the suffering of civilians and would consider the imposition of a no-fly zone in coordination with the African Union if fighting were to continue, said Hisham Yousef, chief of staff of the Arab League. Senator John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, called for the United States to impose a no-fly zone over Libya. While he noted that the Libyan people weren't asking for foreign troops, he said they ""do need the tools to prevent the slaughter of innocents on Libyan streets."" Defense Secretary Robert Gates, speaking to a House committee, said creating a no-fly zone would have to begin with an attack on Libya. ""If it's ordered, we can do it, but ... there's a lot of, frankly, loose talk about some of these military options, and let's just call a spade a spade. A no-fly zone begins with an attack on Libya to destroy the air defenses. That's the way you do a no-fly zone, and then you can fly planes around the country and not worry about our guys being shot down,"" he told a House Appropriations hearing. ""But that's the way it starts."" The administration is far from arming any opposition power, primarily because U.S. officials still don't know who the opposition is and what they are trying to achieve, senior U.S. officials said. The United States is trying to contact a variety of Libyans in an attempt to figure out who the opposition is, but officials said no single group or individual has emerged in a leadership role. Instead, the rebels appears to be composed of a wide and diverse group of Libyans, including civilians formerly allied with Gadhafi government, former military officers, longtime opponents of the regime and tribal leaders, the officials said. These various factions have divergent goals and perspectives: Some are focused on their individual neighborhoods, others take a more regional or national approach. The sole unifying factor is they all oppose Gadhafi, the officials said. The lack of a readily identifiable opposition leadership group can be traced to the fact that, during his nearly 42 years of iron rule, Gadhafi has not allowed an opposition center of power to form, the officials said. Though opposition members all want to replace Gadhafi, they may not all be committed to a future democratic Libya, the officials said. ""We are working to understand who is legitimate, who is not, but it is premature in our opinion to recognize one group or another,"" Clinton said Wednesday. ""We have to keep our focus at this point on helping the Libyan people. And I think it's important to recognize that there is a great deal of uncertainty about the motives, the opportunism, if you will, of people who are claiming to be leaders right now."" But pressure for international military intervention appears to be growing as the carnage mounts. Some protesters have charged that troops loyal to Gadhafi have fired on demonstrators, and military planes have bombed several sites held by the opposition. Libya's ambassador to the United States estimated Monday that as many as 2,000 people may have been killed. ""I believe the global community cannot be on the sidelines while airplanes are allowed to bomb and strafe,"" said Kerry, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations committee. ""A no-fly zone is not a long-term proposition, assuming the outcome is what all desire, and I believe that we ought to be ready to implement it as necessary."" Gates said taking such action would also require the United States to put more air assets near Libya, because enforcing a no-fly zone would require a great deal of equipment. ""It also requires more airplanes than you would find on a single aircraft carrier. So it is a big operation in a big country,"" Gates said. The U.S. military could speed up deployment of a second aircraft carrier if necessary to support a no-fly zone over Libya or other operations, according to Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Gary Roughead. The USS George H. W. Bush is scheduled to deploy from Norfolk, Virginia, later this spring, Roughead told reporters Wednesday, though it could leave earlier. ""That ship is ready,"" he said. He emphasized that it was not his decision to accelerate the deployment. ""That's not my call. I get the forces ready to go and, so you know, that is an available asset,"" Roughead said. He also would not comment on whether a no-fly operation could be enforced over Libya from a single aircraft carrier. The carrier USS Enterprise is believed to be nearby in the Red Sea. ""That would depend on the tasking,"" Roughead said. Two amphibious ships moved into the Suez Canal Tuesday with humanitarian response supplies such as water treatment equipment and temporary shelter, Roughead said. Kerry also said he was working on an aid package for the Mideast, saying that a ""significant financial commitment by the U.S."" will be critical to help what he called a ""monumental and uplifting transformation"" in the region. Clinton's appearance before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was originally slated as a defense of President Barack Obama's budget for 2012. She told lawmakers that it is important to continue counterterrorism programs in North Africa, noting that some members of al Qaeda had come from Libya. Clinton warned that one of the biggest U.S. concerns is that ""Libya could become a giant Somalia"" if the United States is not active in the region.

"Washington (CNN) -- Abdullah al-Kidd -- a U.S. citizen -- was held in jail by the U.S. government for 16 days as a ""material witness"" in an ongoing terror investigation. He was never charged, and never called to testify. Now the Supreme Court will decide whether the Kansas native can hold former Bush administration officials -- especially onetime Attorney General John Ashcroft -- personally liable for wrongful arrest and detention. In oral arguments Wednesday, the justices appeared split along conservative-liberal lines about both the immunity question and the larger issue of when the government can hold in custody citizens it is unable to charge, for fear they may commit future crimes, including terrorism. Chief Justice John Roberts said allowing such a lawsuit to proceed would impose a ""heavy burden"" on government officials and police as they do their jobs, for fear ""if they guess wrong, it comes out of their pocket."" But Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg called al-Kidd's experience ""obvious mistreatment"" that perhaps should leave someone accountable. The case -- with its issue of the limits of ""preventive"" detention, especially in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks -- is the only national security case the high court will address this term. Material witness laws allow officials to detain those who may have knowledge of crimes committed by others to ensure they would testify in criminal proceedings, including before a grand jury and at trial. American Civil Liberties Union lawyers representing al-Kidd say the government has warped the law to allow open-ended arrests and confinement of citizens, without being later held accountable for those wrongfully held. Al-Kidd was a college football player at the University of Idaho when he converted to Islam, changing his name from Lavoni Kidd. He eventually began volunteering at an Islamic charity led by a person being investigated for possible terrorism ties. He was never implicated in wrongdoing, but was interviewed repeatedly and voluntarily by the FBI. He was never told his testimony would be needed in any prosecution, nor was he forbidden to leave the country. Six months later, in March 2003, al-Kidd was about to board a plane at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, headed for Saudi Arabia study region for his doctorate. But he was arrested by government agents armed with a material warrant. An affidavit submitted to a federal magistrate said al-Kidd had a one-way first class plane ticket, and that he was ""crucial"" to the prosecution of Sami Omar al-Hussayen. It was later revealed the ticket was two-way -- indicating he planned to return to the United States -- and he would fly coach class. In his lawsuit, al-Kidd says he was held in three prisons in Virginia, Oklahoma, and Idaho, under high security with convicted criminals. He says he was routinely shackled, strip-searched, and left naked in a freezing cell while male and female guards watched. He was freed after more than two weeks, but only after agreeing to surrender his passport and confine his travel, among other conditions. He now teaches in Saudi Arabia and did not attend oral arguments at the high court. Al-Hussayen, meanwhile, was charged with visa fraud and making false statements. He was acquitted one some of the charges but the jury deadlocked on others. He agreed to be deported to avoid a retrial. Al-Kidd later sued corrections officials; that suit was settled out of court. But it is his separate suit against Ashcroft, holding him personally accountable as head of the Justice Department, that is the heart of the current legal fight. A federal appeals court had allowed his civil lawsuit to continue, but Ashcroft argues officials under his supervision obeyed the letter and spirit of the material witness law. An arrest warrant was properly obtained under the law they said, and even if there were improper motives behind this particular detention, Ashcroft would still enjoy ""absolute"" immunity. Previous lawsuits by a variety of civil liberty and human rights groups naming Ashcroft and other top Bush officials -- including Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and FBI Director Robert Mueller -- have almost unanimously been tossed out by federal courts on immunity grounds. In oral arguments, the justices debated the immediate intent of al-Kidd's detention: Was it to ensure his assistance in an ongoing prosecution, or was it aimed at unlimited detention and investigation? Al-Kidd claims investigators held him in a desperate attempt to implicate him in the investigation of his friend. Some members of the bench were clearly uncomfortable with the idea of blanket immunity for the highest government officials, whatever their reasons. ""Prosecutors can out of spite, out of pure investigative reasoning, out of whatever motive they have, just lock people up,"" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor, while clarifying that may not be what happened in al-Kidd's case. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was more blunt, calling some of the allegations ""very disturbing."" ""We are talking about the attorney general and the attorney general's immunity,"" she told the Justice Department lawyer arguing the case. ""But there are allegations here that this man was kept awake, the lights shining in his cell for 24 hours, kept without clothes. Now that doesn't sound like the way one would treat someone whose testimony you want. Is there a remedy that he has for that obvious mistreatment?"" On the other side, Roberts warned making it easier to sue for violations of the law would open the floodgates to endless lawsuits. ""The allegation can so readily be made in every case under the material witness statute ... that this is one of those 'bad intent' cases, and the case has to proceed so that we can prove that."" Roberts wondered what an officer faced with deciding whether to proceed with a terror investigation or similarly serious matter would think. ""If I'm the officer in that situation, I say, 'Well, I'm just not going to run the risk of having to sell the house'"" because his decision could be overturned someday by a court. Justice Elena Kagan is not participating in the case because she helped brief the case for the government last year as solicitor general, just before joining the high court. That leaves the possibility of a 4-4 tie, which would give victory to al-Kidd, allowing his lawsuit to proceed. Ashcroft has the support of the Obama administration, which argued the case in the high court, as well as several former attorneys general. ""We think the way that one vindicates one's rights is to use the process that is available to those that are arrested to seek their release,"" said Richard Samp of the Washington Legal Foundation, who filed the supporting brief. ""And in fact, Mr. al-Kidd did exactly that. He had a lawyer appointed for him. He went into court on several occasions and within 15 days after the time of his arrest he was released."" But about 30 former federal prosecutors are backing al-Kidd. Lee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney, told CNN the government should not be allowed to do an ""end run"" around the law. ""Our client would like vindication for his own rights. He would like to see his reputation cleared. But I think, perhaps most of all in his mind, he would like to see the court say that this cannot be done anymore and so it doesn't happen to people in the future."" The case is Ashcroft v. al-Kidd (10-98). A ruling is due by late June.","Abdullah al-Kidd was held for 16 days as a material witness .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- An Indian court has handed down death sentences to 11 people for their role in the 2002 burning of a train carrying Hindu activists in the western state of Gujarat. Twenty other people convicted of the same arson attack were sentenced to life in prison, public prosecutor J.M. Panchal said Tuesday. A life sentence in India runs for 20 years, and a prisoner can apeal after he has served 14, Panchal said. The 20 who were sentenced to life have spent nine years in jail that will count toward their sentence, he said. A suspected Muslim mob attacked the Sabarmati Express near the town of Godhra on 27 February, 2002, killing more than 50 people, most of whom were Hindu pilgrims. The Hindu pilgrims were returning from the north Indian town of Ayodhya where they had been demanding that the government build a temple on the ruins of a 16th century mosque. The train fire sparked days of rioting in which more than a thousand people, mostly Muslims, were killed. Defense attorney I.M. Munshi said he would appeal the convictions. ""I am not able to swallow it,"" Munshi said. ""This is not the final verdict. It's always appealable,"" he said, referring to the rights of the convicts to challenge the sentencing in higher courts. Death-row prisoners in India can file appeals in the Supreme Court in New Delhi if their petitions are turned down by lower courts. A mercy petition to the Indian president is the ultimate option they have if the top court too dismisses their pleas. Police had charged 94 men for setting fire to the train. Sixty-three of the accused, including one of the main conspirators, were acquitted Tuesday due to lack of evidence, prosecutors said.","Twenty receive life sentences .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Despite stopping production on the sitcom ""Two and a Half Men,"" Warner Bros. Television said Tuesday it will pay the show's crew for the four episodes initially set to begin production this week. Warner Bros. spokesman Paul McGuire confirmed the payments will be made. According to TMZ, the payments will amount to about $2 million for the 200 core crew members. CBS halted production of the show, starring Charlie Sheen, after Sheen's call to a radio show last week. On Monday, Sheen in interviews threatened to sue CBS over the action. He also told NBC he wanted $3 million per episode instead of the $2 million he was previously making, but later backed off that assertion, telling CNN's Piers Morgan that his only hard-and-fast demand was that he and the crew get paid for another eight weeks of work. Sheen said he could ""sort of understand why"" show executives felt they had to intervene after a series of high-profile incidents he has been involved in, but reiterated to CNN that he felt his private life was his own business. He has also lashed out at the show's co-creator, Chuck Lorre. CBS and Warner Bros. Television said in a joint statement last week that ""Based on the totality of Charlie Sheen's statements, conduct and condition, CBS and Warner Bros. Television have decided to discontinue production of 'Two and a Half Men' for the remainder of the season."" Warner Bros. Television is owned by Time Warner Inc., the parent company of CNN. CBS previously placed the sitcom on ""production hiatus"" after the actor began rehab treatments. The show had been scheduled to resume taping on four more episodes this week. It's not clear if ""Two and Half Men"" will return for a ninth season. Meanwhile, Sheen has reportedly demanded an apology from the Anti-Defamation League for comments the group's director made last week. Sheen on Monday denied any anti-Semitic intent behind his earlier comments on Lorre, in which he said Lorre's real name was Chaim Levine. ""I've never had that in my past,"" he said. ""You can look as deep and as far as you want."" But ADL National Director Abraham H. Foxman said in a statement last week, ""By invoking television producer Chuck Lorre's Jewish name in the context of an angry tirade against him, Charlie Sheen left the impression that another reason for his dislike of Mr. Lorre is his Jewishness. This fact has no relevance to Mr. Sheen's complaint or disagreement, and his words are at best bizarre, and at worst, borderline anti-Semitism."" TMZ reported Tuesday that Sheen's attorney sent the ADL a letter demanding a retraction because Sheen's only intent was ""to address the man rather than his television persona."" ADL spokesman Todd Gutnick told CNN that ""since Charlie Sheen has made this a legal issue with the Anti-Defamation League, we will refrain from making any further comment at this time."" And a source close to Sheen's ex-wife, Denise Richards, sought Tuesday to emphasize the couple's two daughters, Sam and Lola, are with Richards, not with Sheen. The source asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. On Monday during an interview at his home with TMZ, Sheen introduced the reporter to his two girlfriends, whom he called ""goddesses."" ""Charlie's so-called 'goddesses' have never met the girls and they will not see them,"" said the source. ""Any impression that may be out there that the girls are running around Charlie's house is inaccurate.""","Payments will amount to about $2 million for the 200 core crew members .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Toyota on Wednesday announced recalls involving more than 1.5 million vehicles worldwide for issues that could result in fuel leakage, the company said. One recall involves about 1.2 million units of 16 models -- including the Noah and other models -- within Japan and 140,000 Avensis and Tourer models overseas because of faulty fuel pipes that could cause fuel leakage, according to the company. A separate recall involves 245,000 2006 through 2007 Lexus GS300/350 vehicles, 2006 through early 2009 Lexus IS250 vehicles and 2006 through early 2008 Lexus IS350 vehicles sold in the United States to inspect the fuel pressure sensor installation, according to a company statement. ""Due to insufficient tightening of the fuel pressure sensor connected to certain engine fuel delivery pipes ... there is a possibility that the pressure sensor could loosen over time,"" the statement said. ""Lexus dealers will inspect the vehicle for fuel leakage and if no leakage is found, will tighten the fuel pressure sensor with the proper torque. If a fuel leak is confirmed, the gasket between the sensor and the delivery pipe will be replaced and the sensor will be tightened with the proper torque."" The inspection and possible gasket replacement will be conducted at no charge to the vehicle owner, according to the company statement. Toyota said no accidents have been reported in relation to the recalls.

"London (CNN) -- A British Airways employee was found guilty Monday of four terror-related charges, including plotting to blow up an airplane, a court in London said. Rajib Karim, 31, worked as a software engineer for British Airways in the northern English city of Newcastle. He used his position to pass on information to al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen, including to U.S.-born radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, jurors in the four-week-long trial in London were told. Karim, who was arrested last year, admitted offering himself for terrorist operations, making a jihadi recruitment video and fundraising for terrorism, but denied knowing that information he gave al-Awlaki would be used for terrorism. Prosecutors said he passed on information that would have been useful for terrorists plotting to blow up a plane and also information that could have been used to help plan a ""disruptive"" cyber attack on British Airways. Al-Awlaki is thought to be hiding out in Yemen, and was recently described by U.S. President Barack Obama's counterterror chief, Michael Leiter, as posing a bigger threat to the U.S. homeland than Osama bin Laden. A key part of the prosecution case was a series of heavily encrypted messages between al-Awlaki and Karim, in which al-Awlaki pressed for information about Karim's job and his knowledge of airport security. ""I pray that Allah may grant us a breakthrough through you ... can you please specify your role in the airline industry, how much access do you have to airports, what information do you have on the limitations and cracks in present airport security systems?"" Karim replied: ""The kuffar (a derogatory term for non-Muslims) are planning to install full body scanners across UK airports. This allows them to see things under clothes."" But he warned al-Awlaki to be realistic: ""You are probably hoping that I work at the airport, but the fact is I don't. I personally know two brothers, one who works in baggage handling at Heathrow and another who works in airport security. Both are good practising brothers and sympathize towards the cause of the mujahedeen."" Replying, al-Awlaki got straight to the point: . ""Our highest priority is the U.S. Anything there, even on a smaller scale compared to what we may do in the UK, would be our choice. So the question is: with the people you have is it possible to get a package or person with a package on board a flight heading to the U.S.?"" Karim, who was born in Bangladesh and is now a British citizen, had been in the UK three years at that point, prosecutor Jonathan Laidlaw said. CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said this communication confirmed what U.S. intelligence officials had been saying for some time: ""This trial has presented Awlaki not only as the charismatic driving force behind al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula but also a key operational figure in the group, a guy who is orchestrating plots against the West."" The exchange of messages took place in January 2010 and February 2010, just weeks after AQAP was blamed for a failed bomb attack on a Delta Airlines transatlantic flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, a 23-year-old Nigerian man, had trained with AQAP in Yemen before attempting to detonate explosives sewn into his underpants, according to U.S. officials. AQAP has also been widely blamed by western intelligence officials for twin foiled attacks on cargo aircraft last October. One device, hidden in a printer cartridge and described as ""viable"" by British officials, was uncovered on a UPS plane after it landed at East Midlands airport in the United Kingdom. The other -- also hidden in a printer cartridge - was found on a FedEx plane at Dubai airport. British investigators say they have no evidence that links Karim to either of these plots. They describe him as ""dedicated to the terrorist cause,"" though they say there was no imminent danger of him launching an attack himself. Police have also refused to say where the original tip-off about Karim came from, saying only, ""We had some information that made him of interest to us."" Karim is due to be sentenced March 18.","Rajib Karim gave information to radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, a court finds .

"(CNN) -- English club Arsenal will be without Robin van Persie and Theo Walcott for their Champions League last-16 second leg with Spanish champions Barcelona, but it is ""possible"" captain Cesc Fabregas could play. Van Persie injured his knee scoring in Sunday's League Cup final defeat against Birmingham while Walcott sprained his ankle during the Premier League victory over Stoke City. But Fabregas, who played a key part in Arsenal's thrilling 2-1 victory over Barcelona during the first leg in London, has an outside chance to make the second leg on March 8. He limped off after just 14 minutes against Stoke with a hamstring strain but could be fit to face the club he left as a 16-year-old. ""Cesc is looking possible [for that game],"" Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger told the club's official website on Tuesday. ""He is making quick and good progress. It is possible."" The news is more bleak on Dutch striker Van Persie, who is facing three weeks on the sidelines, meaning he will definitely be absent for Arsenal's trip to Spain. Wenger added: ""Unfortunately, we had bad news on the scan and he will be out for the next three weeks for sure. ""It could be longer. The shortest delay we can imagine is three weeks [so] he is definitely out for Barcelona."" England winger Walcott will also be absent, with Wenger confirming: ""He is out. We said from the day he got the injury against Stoke you could count three weeks."" The clash with Barcelona has taken on added significance after Arsenal failed to end their six-year trophy drought thanks to a last-minute Carling Cup defeat against Birmingham at Wembley on Sunday.

"(CNN) -- America's bid to spread basketball's popularity will continue in the next two years, with Britain to stage men's NBA and women's WNBA pre-season matches along with Olympic build-up games for the U.S. international teams. London has hosted NBA teams for the past few years, with this week's double-header between New Jersey Nets and Toronto Raptors the first during a regular season. However, the focus will soon move north of the UK capital to Manchester. The WNBA's Atlanta Dream will launch the series of matches later this year, when they face an as-yet-unknown opposition in an exhibition contest on May 29. It will be only the second match outside of the U.S. in the WNBA's history, coming seven years after the first in Monterrey, Mexico. The U.S. squads will head into the London 2012 Games as gold medallists after both men's and women's teams emerged victorious from the 2008 tournament in Beijing, China. The opposition for next year's preparation matches, which could see basketball superstars such as Kobe Bryant and LeBron James play at the 18,100-capacity Manchester Evening News Arena, have not yet been decided. ""It is a real 'who's who' of the basketball world. It will be fantastic preparation,"" NBA Europe senior vice president Sophie Goldschmidt told the UK Press Association on Monday. ""It will really tip off their 2012 campaign. Hopefully the people will really embrace them and support the team."" In 2013, Manchester will then become only the second British city to host an NBA pre-season match. Atlanta Dream head coach Marynell Meadors, whose team reached the play-offs the last two seasons, is looking forward to the new experience. ""It will be terrific for us. This will be our second pre-season game and five days later we open our campaign,"" she said. ""It will prepare us for travel. It will prepare us for playing someone different. We will learn something from it."" Goldschmidt said the matches would help boost basketball in one of its developing countries. ""It is great to showcase our events, but it is about the legacy we will leave behind. With every event we bring there will be an integrated plan giving more young kids the chance to get involved in basketball,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- Venezuela's president has spoken with embattled Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi about a proposal to bring an international mediation team to Libya, Venezuela's information minister confirmed Wednesday. The two leaders conversed Tuesday, Minister Andrez Izarra said in a post on his Twitter account. ""All the contacts that Venezuela is making with the Arab world and the entire world is for peace in Libya. Tomorrow new developments,"" the tweet read. Earlier this week, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said the United States' criticisms of Gadhafi had a clear aim: military invasion. ""Let's not get carried away by the drums of war, because the United States, I am sure that they are exaggerating and distorting things to justify an invasion,"" Chavez said Monday, according to Venezuelan state media. The United States has said all options are on the table. Speaking in Caracas Monday, Chavez proposed sending an international committee to Libya to mediate and help develop a peaceful solution to unrest in the North African country. ""Instead of sending marines and tanks and planes, why don't we send a goodwill commission to try to help so that they do not continue killing in Libya? They are our brothers,"" he said in a speech televised on the government-run network. Chavez and Gadhafi have a close relationship, having bonded partly over shared opposition to U.S. global influence. At a lavish Tripoli celebration commemorating 40 years of Gadhafi's leadership in 2009, the two leaders sat side-by-side during a two-hour military parade. That same year, a new football stadium in Benghazi was named after the Venezuelan leader. As rumors swirled about Gadhafi and his whereabouts last week, some suggested that he may be en route to Venezuela. Those reports proved to be false; the Libyan leader later spoke publicly in his country's capital. But the close ties between the two leaders remain strong. On Monday, Chavez said Gadhafi ""has been my friend and our friend for a long time"" in remarks broadcast on Venezuelan state television. ""We must be cautious. We know what our policy is: we do not support invasions, or massacres, or anything, no matter who does it. But there is no doubt that, regarding Libya, a campaign of lies is being woven -- the same that has been woven about Venezuela for a long time,"" he said. The U.N. Security Council over the weekend voted for tough restrictions and possible war crimes charges against the Libyan regime. CNN's Nelson Quinones and journalist Osmary Hernandez Sosa contributed to this report.","The Venezuelan leader proposes sending a goodwill commission to mediate in Libya .

"(CNN) -- A late Frank Lampard penalty handed Chelsea a vital 2-1 win over English Premier League leaders Manchester United to breath new life into the title race. Alex Ferguson's side had taken the lead in the first half thanks to a thunderous strike from England forward Wayne Rooney but Brazil defender David Luiz drew Chelsea level. Then Russia international Yuri Zhirkov drew a foul from Chris Smalling in the 79th minute and Lampard blasted his spot kick high into the net to hand the defending champions a crucial win. United's misery was compounded in injury time as Serbian defender Nemanja Vidic was sent off after earning a second yellow card and will now miss the trip to Liverpool on Sunday. The real victors were second-placed Arsenal who can close the gap on United at the top of the table to just one point if they win their game in hand. The Gunners still have to play United at home. Chelsea's victory keeps alive their faint title hopes and moves them into the Champions League places in fourth but they still trail United by 12 points. After the game Ferguson took aim at referee Martin Atkinson telling Sky Sports: ""It was a bad one to concede the first goal but the penalty kick is so soft, deary me. We played well but we didn't deserve that. That's three years in a row referee's decisions have changed the game."" Ferguson also thought Luiz should have been sent off after he blocked Rooney off the ball when he was already on a yellow card: ""It's incredible, he'd done Chicarito [Javier Hernandez] off the ball, late, nothing done, ref's in front of it. He does Rooney clear as day and the ref doesn't do anything. That changes the game."" Carlo Ancelotti admitted Luiz may have been ""lucky"" but said United were still ""too far ahead"" for Chelsea to have any realistic chance of retaining their title. Ancelotti again chose to start $80.5 million striker Fernando Torres ahead of Didier Drogba, who began on the substitutes bench. Chelsea had the first chance as Florent Malouda connected with Ramires' cross but his effort was right at United's veteran Dutch keeper Edwin Van der Sar. Just before the half hour mark United broke the deadlock after Rooney found space outside the area and lashed a low shot into the bottom corner of the net. Chelsea nearly hit back before halftime as Lampard's free kick was parried by Van der Sar but Branislav Ivanovic couldn't convert the rebound. Eight minutes after the interval Chelsea were level as new signing Luiz popped up at the back post to fire a volley inside the post. After half chances at both ends the game was settled from the spot after substitute Zhirkov knocked the ball through Smalling's legs and was tripped. Lampard hammered the ball into the roof of the net emphatically. Two minutes later Zhirkov almost made the game safe as he crashed a volley towards the bottom corner but Vidic managed to divert the ball onto the post and away for a corner. Fabio almost rescued United with a late run into the box but he couldn't reach the ball to apply a finish and Chelsea held out for a confidence-boosting win. Elsewhere, Reading, who play in the second tier of English football, knocked Premier League Everton out of the FA Cup. Matt Mills struck the only goal as he pounced on a rebound to slam a volley into the net on 26 minutes. Reading were thankful to a stunning late save from Alex McCarthy who denied Leon Osman and ensured his side booked a quarterfinal clash with either Manchester City or Aston Villa, who play their fifth round replay on Wednesday.","Chelsea beat Manchester United 2-1 in the English Premier League .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. government stepped up its humanitarian relief effort for Libya on Friday, sending two C-130 military transport planes loaded with supplies to neighboring Tunisia. Each aircraft carried three pallets of aid supplies, including 2,000 blankets, 40 rolls of plastic sheeting and 9,600 10-liter water cans, according to a statement from the U.S. Agency for International Development. The supplies, meant to help up to 2,000 people, will be handed off to Tunisia's Red Crescent organization for distribution, the statement noted. The relief operation -- designed to help those who have fled the Libyan violence -- is named Odyssey Dawn, Pentagon spokesman Col. Dave Lapan said. American authorities are considering multiple ways to assist in the crisis, but are currently focused primarily on humanitarian efforts, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told reporters. The Obama administration remains deeply ""concerned with the ongoing violence ... initiated and perpetrated"" by the government of Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi, she said. Clinton noted, however, that there is currently ""a lot of confusion on the ground"" in Libya that makes it tough to understand exactly what is happening there. Addressing reporters on Air Force One, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney reiterated the administration's position that Gadhafi needs to step aside. ""Col. Gadhafi has no legitimacy and should step down and should cease all violence,"" Carney said.  ""We believe that that would result in a more peaceful Libya."" The violence in Libya escalated Friday as pro-government forces took control of Zawiya, a city near Tripoli, according to state TV. One source reported the deaths of 15 people and injuries to at least 200 others. A doctor at a hospital in Zawiya told CNN ""there is a river of blood"" where the wounded were being treated. He described the situation as ""very bad,"" with the facility running out of medical supplies. Forces loyal to Gadhafi also clashed Friday with opponents of the regime in the eastern city of Ras Lanuf, opposition fighters and commanders said. Roughly 200,000 people have fled the intensifying violence in Libya, according to the International Organization for Migration. The number of people trying to leave, however, has declined heavily as armed government forces have intensified their presence on the Tunisian border and on roads leading up to it, the United Nations refugee agency has noted. A number of key congressional leaders have been pressuring the White House to establish a no-fly zone over parts of Libya to aid Gadhafi's opponents and ease the humanitarian crisis. Gadhafi's ""air defense systems are certainly old and it (should not be) a major challenge ... to impose a no-fly zone,"" Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, asserted Friday. While the administration has shifted additional military resources closer to Libya, it has refused to commit to such a course of action so far. CNN's Alan Silverleib and Barbara Starr contributed to this report .","The U.S. government has sent two C-130 cargo planes to Tunisia .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Pop singer and actress Christina Aguilera was detained early Tuesday ""to ensure her safety"" after her rumored boyfriend was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence, authorities said. Aguilera, 30, was a passenger in a car that was stopped about 2:45 a.m. (5:45 a.m. ET) in West Hollywood, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said in a news release. ""The driver, Matthew Rutler, was determined to be driving while under the influence of alcohol and arrested,"" the release said. Aguilera was determined to be intoxicated, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore. ""She was not capable of taking care of herself,"" he told reporters, but said she was ""very cooperative, not belligerent in any way."" She was technically arrested on a public intoxication charge, Whitmore said, but ""there was never the intent to prosecute."" Such actions are routine in such instances -- when a driver is arrested and a passenger is determined to be intoxicated. Since Aguilera was not able to care for herself ""and no one was available to ensure her safety, Aguilera was taken into custody,"" the statement said. The department ""stressed that she was not involved in any criminal activity."" Aguilera will have a record of the misdemeanor arrest, Whitmore said, and was booked, fingerprinted, put in a jail cell and monitored. However, she will not face charges, he said. ""The law specifically allows for no desire to prosecute."" Aguilera was released about 7:30 a.m. (10:30 a.m. ET) after passing a sobriety test, he said. Rutler's bail was set at $5,000, he said, not the $30,000 reported on the sheriff's website. He said Rutler was in the process of bailing out of jail Tuesday morning. The car was pulled over after authorities noticed it ""driving erratically,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Tregg Duerson, his face drawn and his eyes exhausted, expressed confusion and dismay about many of the details surrounding his father's suicide last week. But he is sure about one thing. ""I wish I knew more answers. All I can do is trust what he's told me ... what he asked me to do with his brain,"" Duerson said. Last week, David Duerson, a 50-year-old former player for the NFL's Chicago Bears, committed suicide by shooting himself in the chest. The details remain hazy, but family members believe that Duerson avoided injuring his brain so that it could be tested for disease. In the coming months, a group of scientists at the Boston University School of Medicine will scour his brain tissue for evidence of an insidious disease among footballers called chronic traumatic encephalopathy. ""That has to take a lot of strength and a lot of courage to do that,"" said Otis Wilson, Duerson's best friend and former Bears teammate. ""To donate your brain and the way that things went down. He's always been a strong person on and off the field, and even at the end, he's trying to help someone."" Warner: Playing through concussion 'part of the game' Although Duerson did not say explicitly that he suspected chronic traumatic encephalopathy, his ex-wife said he knew that ""something was not right."" Recently, his vision had been failing him; so had his ability to form coherent sentences and spell. And there was piercing pain on the left side of his brain. ""He felt the left side of his brain was the cause of many of his problems that he was experiencing,"" said Duerson's ex-wife, Alicia Duerson. The disease is associated with depression, cognitive problems and suicidal thoughts -- all of which Duerson seemed to suffer before his death. Dr. Robert Stern, a co-director of the Boston University School of Medicine Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy, stressed that as of now, ""We have no idea whether he had a disease."" It will be months before scientists can confirm whether Duerson's cognitive and emotional problems were related to chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Once a brain is donated, Stern gets to work, quizzing the donors' family members to get an accurate picture of the person's health, behavior changes and the amount of brain trauma he or she suffered. At the same time, Dr. Ann McKee, a neurologist and co-director of the center, examines thin slivers of the donor's brain and spinal cord tissue under a powerful microscope. ""(McKee) does her determination of brain tissue without knowing much about the individual history and symptoms,"" Stern said. ""So it doesn't bias her interpretation of the brain exam findings."" What McKee has found in most of the brains she has examined is a central nervous system riddled with brown tangles -- damage characteristic of chronic traumatic encephalopathy -- in athletes with evidence of repeated brain trauma. Of more than 40 brains studied at Boston University, more than three-quarters have shown evidence of the disease. ""It is quite striking to see case after case, especially the ones who took many years of brain trauma, to find this in nearly every one,"" said Chris Nowinski, co-director of the Boston University center. Alicia Duerson said her ex-husband suffered countless concussions on the field. ""Sometimes he would come home (from football games) with extreme headaches,"" she said. ""We would meet after the game, and he would want me to drive because he felt dizziness or he just didn't feel stable."" Concussions, and traumatic brain injuries generally, have been implicated as a prime factor in chronic traumatic encephalopathy. It is a fact that has dogged the National Football League, which, for its part, has implemented more rigorous testing of players and rules changes to combat the trend. NFL head hits may mean sideline exams . The NFL has also expressed an interest in sharing donated brain tissue, in cases such as Duerson's, so that it can perform analysis of brain tissue in conjunction with institutions like Boston University. The league is seeking collaboration among experts studying the disease and is partnering with the National Institutes of Health and the University of Pennsylvania for more eyes, so to speak, on the issue. ""More people looking at this might give us a better answer,"" said Dr. Richard Ellenbogen, co-chairman of the NFL Head, Neck and Spine Medical Committee. ""We are taking this very seriously, and accelerating research on (the disease) will help get us more insight."" For Duerson's family, the first clue that something was wrong came by way of a cryptic text: ""a bizarre text message that he sent to my mother saying that he loved her and he loved my family and to please get his brain to the NFL brain bank,"" Tregg Duerson said. If the text at first seemed mysterious, the same wish echoed by Duerson in a suicide note seemed to cement his resolve. It contained a simple, haunting final request: ""Please, see that my brain is given to the NFL's brain bank."" Despite the chilling details of Duerson's suicide last week -- and the questions still looming -- his family and friends cling to the hope that something good will come of their pain. ""It gives us a lot of comfort knowing that something positive and something great is going to come out of this for future players, for little leaguers, for everyone,"" Alicia Duerson said of her ex-husband's suicide. ""I think that is what we're holding on to as a family. ... We're just so proud of him at this very moment."" As difficult as it is to think about his friend's demise, Wilson said he hopes that it will all make sense someday and that something substantive will happen as a result of Duerson's donation. ""And once they find out what the cause is ... that the NFL takes a stand and says, 'OK, we're going to try to alleviate this problem, because if you don't, then all this was for nothing,"" Wilson said.","David Duerson, former NFL player, shot himself in the chest last week .

"(CNN) -- It's not often that a Nobel Peace Prize laureate gets fired, but the Bangladeshi government said Wednesday it did just that in dismissing Muhammad Yunus from a top post in the pioneering bank he founded. Grameen Bank's general manager, however, disputed the government's claim. K.M. Abdul Waddod, the general manager of the Bangladesh Central Bank's regulation and policy department, said his bank, the regulatory authority in the South Asian nation, had sent for a second time a letter to the Grameen Bank chairman, urging the ouster of Yunus from his post of managing director because he was past retirement age. The government, which has a 25% stake in Grameen, said that by the bank's own rules, Yunus, now 70, was required to end his service when he turned 60. ""He did not inform us he is over that age,"" Waddod said. ""The bank did let him go."" Muzammel Huq, the new government-appointed Grameen chairman, told CNN that he had received the letter of the central bank. ""The central bank has removed Professor Yunus as managing director of the bank and I'll act accordingly under the bank's law,"" Huq said. He said the deputy managing director of the bank will take over until Yunus' post can be filled. But a Grameen Bank statement said Yunus had not been fired. ""This is a legal issue,"" said the statement signed by Jannat-E-Quanine, Grameen's general manager. ""Grameen Bank has been duly complying with all applicable laws. It has also complied with the law in respect of appointment of the managing director. According to the bank's legal advisers, the founder of Grameen Bank, Nobel laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus, is accordingly continuing in his office."" Yunus pioneered microcredit financing and founded Grameen Bank nearly three decades ago in an effort to alleviate poverty by lending to the poor, who could not otherwise qualify for bank loans. Throughout this battle with the government, he has refused to resign from the bank that won him a Nobel prize in 2006. Yunus' supporters say the effort to remove him has little to do with age and much to do with the larger issue of microcredit and its primary vehicle in Bangladesh -- Grameen Bank. A recent television documentary alleged that Yunus illegally diverted Grameen money. Grameen denied the charges and investigators in Norway, a key bank donor, found no evidence of wrongdoing. But critics of microcredit have charged that lenders were making big money off of small loans. Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina minced no words when she compared Grameen's operations to ""sucking the blood from the poor in the name of alleviating poverty."" Yunus' supporters also say that he is under fire for criticizing politicians and trying to form his own political party four years ago during an interim, unelected military-backed government. That party was later abandoned. The government, however, denies that the Grameen actions are politically motivated. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh and Moni Basu and journalist Farid Ahmed contributed to this report.","The government says Muhammad Yunus was removed as general manager .

"LONDON, England  -- The British Home Secretary Jacqui Smith has been asked to intervene after Iraqi international Nashat Akram was refused a work permit. Nashat Akram was hoping to become the first Iraqi footballer to play in England. Akram starred in Iraq's Asian Cup-winning team last year and was set to play for Premier League Manchester City.

To gain a work permit, the player's national side must be in the top 70 of the FIFA world rankings and Iraq has a highest ranking of 71.

Keith Vaz, a member of the ruling Labour party, said: ""I shall be calling on the home secretary to review this decision. ""Here we have someone who wants to come and work legitimately, a role model for his country, whose presence here can heal divisions in Iraq.

He is a very good footballer with an excellent international pedigree. ""He has now returned to the Middle East and we will keep in touch with him. He is somebody who we will maintain an interest in for the long term."" City have already lost an appeal to the Home Office ruling, but the Iraqi government has now taken up the cause.

"(CNN) -- Harvard University moved Thursday to allow ROTC programs to set up on campus, after years of restricting the U.S. military's access because of its ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy. The Cambridge, Massachusetts, school barred Reserve Officers' Training Corps programs from being based on its campus 40 years ago, at the height of the Vietnam War. For more than a decade, university leaders -- among them, former law school dean and current U.S. Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan -- have cited the military's policy prohibiting gays and lesbians from serving openly as the chief rationale for continuing the ban. Harvard President Drew Faust cited the recent decision to overturn that policy as the genesis for the university's new tact. She will sign an agreement Friday with Navy Secretary Ray Mabus to re-establish a home for ROTC on campus, the school announced in a press release. ""Our renewed relationship affirms the vital role that the members of our armed forces play in serving the nation and securing our freedoms, while also affirming inclusion and opportunity as powerful American ideals,"" Faust said in the statement. The full, formal recognition will take effect once repeal of the so-called ""don't ask, don't tell"" law, which had made it against military policy for homosexuals to serve openly, is complete this summer, according to the release. Harvard will appoint a director for the Navy ROTC program and take over direct financial responsibility for the cost of students to participate in the program. Congress voted to repeal the policy in December, setting off a three-part process. Last month, for instance, all four branches of the U.S. military began training required as part of the repeal. The university is setting up a committee, to be chaired by professor Kevin ""Kit"" Parker, a U.S. Army Reserve captain who served three tours in Afghanistan, to look into a host of issues, including bringing other military branches back onto campus. Harvard was one of the first six educational institutions, in 1926, to host Naval ROTC programs, the Navy noted in a release. Once the change goes into effect, active-duty Navy and Marines personnel will meet on campus with students participating in the ROTC program. ""(Navy) ROTC's return to Harvard is good for the university, good for the military, and good for the country,"" said Mabus, in a statement from the Navy. ""With exposure comes understanding, and through understanding comes strength."" Harvard's own policy regarding ROTC on campus was the subject of national attention eight months ago, when Kagan -- who was then a nominee for the high court -- came under criticism by Republican senators who complained that she actively tried to block military recruiters from Harvard Law School when she was dean. Kagan and the White House strongly defended her actions, saying that while she opposed the military's policy, Kagan never kept recruiters off the university. Four months after taking the job as Harvard's dean, in October 2003, Kagan sent a campus-wide email to students saying that to give recruiters equal access to the campus ""causes me deep distress. I abhor the military's discriminatory recruitment policy."" She called the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy ""a profound wrong -- a moral injustice of the first order."" CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","NEW: The Navy secretary calls the move ""good for the university, good for the military""

"Djerba, Tunisia (CNN) -- Four more U.S. military flights were headed to Cairo from Tunisia on Sunday, evacuating Egyptians fleeing the Libyan conflict, a U.S. official said. One flight left early Sunday and three others will do so by Sunday afternoon, said Adam Lefringhouse, a defense attache at the U.S. Embassy in Tunis. On Saturday, U.S. military planes carried out similar evacuations, returning passengers to Egypt. There are a few thousand Egyptians left in Tunisia awaiting evacuation after more than 40,000 were taken home, said Firas Kayal, a spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency, on Saturday. Many countries, such as India and China, put in place well-organized evacuation operations for their citizens. But others, including Egyptians and Bangladeshis, have been left to fend for themselves. Kayal said Saturday more than 10,000 Bangladeshis are awaiting transport in Tunisia. Many of them have had to walk to the border because their money was stolen by soldiers and they could not pay for transportation costs. One man suffered a heart attack and died, aid officials confirmed. On Sunday, the British government said it will provide emergency evacuation flights to repatriate 500 stranded Bangladeshis. Three commercial charter planes will take the Bangladeshis home from Djerba airport later Sunday, the British government said. ""I have seen for myself the scale of the humanitarian situation on the Libyan border with Tunisia,"" said Andrew Mitchell, the International Development Secretary. ""I vowed that we would do everything possible to give those stranded shelter and get them back home as quickly as possible."" Meanwhile, three people died and 14 were missing when they tried to get off a ship headed from Libya's capital, Tripoli, to Crete, the Greek Ministry for the Protection of Civilians said Sunday. The ship was carrying about 1,280 passengers, mostly Bangladeshis. ""From the evidence gathered so far, it appears the passengers were trying to disembark the 'Ionian King' (Cypriot flag) using a rope,"" the ministry said in a statement. The violence in Libya has generated an exodus out of the North African nation. Almost 200,000 people, a majority of them foreign workers, have fled Libya -- nearly 100,000 to Tunisia and a similar number to Egypt -- according to the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The numbers of people entering Tunisia daily from Libya dropped to 1,800 Thursday and Friday and stood at 3,000 Saturday. Previously, they averaged 10,000 to 15,000 people. Hovig Etyemezian, a field officer for the U.N. refugee agency, attributed the drop in part to fear and the manipulation of the flow of refugees by Libyan authorities. ""A lot of them were scared from leaving because of the fighting so they were staying in their houses,"" he said Saturday. ""We fear the regime might be blocking refugees from the border."" The U.S. State Department said Saturday it would donate $3 million to the International Organization for Migration (IOM) as part of a joint U.S.-IOM partnership to help get home thousands of Egyptians and other nationals from Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia.

"Beijing (CNN) -- A Beijing official blamed attempts to spark protests in China on people ""harboring illusions,"" saying citizens will not take to the streets because they want stability. ""Certain people at home and abroad are  using the internet to instigate illegal gatherings in China and play the  so-called street politics,"" said Wang Hui, director of  the  Information Office in Beijing. ""But sober-minded  people can see that they have chosen the wrong place. It will never  happen in Beijing."" In recent weeks, there have been anonymous calls online for  people to gather in public places in Beijing and a dozen other Chinese  cities in what would be akin to the ""Jasmine Revolution"" that has hit parts of the Middle East. There have been no visible signs of street protests, but Chinese  authorities have taken measure to avert them. Authorities have deployed heavy security in major streets,  especially in Wangfujing, a busy shopping street in downtown Beijing.  Wangfujing is one of the places designated for street protests. China has also tightened rules  on foreign reporters, explicitly warning  them that they risk detention, suspension of press  cards and expulsion  if they show up at  proposed protest sites. ""The people want stability. Those who wish to bring  chaos here are harboring illusions,"" Wang said at a news conference in the Chinese capital. ""They are doomed to  fail."" Last Sunday, some reporters were reportedly man-handled and detained in Wangfujing. Among them was a Bloomberg journalist who was reportedly beaten up by anonymous men. Wang said authorities are investigating the incident, but declined to comment further. ""The city government puts great attention to this case,"" Wang said. ""We do not wish such incidents to happen."" Beijing officials distributed reprinted copies of reporting regulations in China, but said the rules have not changed. ""The important matter is that reporters must obtain prior consent from individuals, institutions and work units that you wish to interview,"" said Li Hongliang, deputy director of the city's foreign affairs office. ""We welcome foreign correspondents to report in Beijing and present the international community a true image of China."" Authorities now require foreign journalists to first submit formal applications before reporting in downtown Beijing.

"Mexico City (CNN) -- A judge convicted 13 members of the Mexican military of crimes connected with trafficking cocaine and methamphetamine while on duty, the country's defense secretary said in a statement. Three officers and 10 troops were convicted of drug and organized crime charges for their involvement in the transport of 928 kilograms of methamphetamine and 30 kilograms of cocaine, the statement said.

"(CNN) -- A U.S. Navy ship came to the rescue of an oil tanker in the Indian Ocean on Saturday after four suspected pirates climbed aboard. The Japanese-owned MV Guanabara reported it was under attack Friday afternoon 328 nautical miles southeast of Oman, the Navy said. The Guanabara had 24 crew members aboard. The warship USS Bulkeley, assigned to the Combined Maritime Forces' CTF-151 counter-piracy mission, was directed to intercept the Guanabara, supported by the Turkish warship TCG Giresun of NATO's counter-piracy task force. After Guanabara's master confirmed to the Bulkeley that his crew had taken refuge in the ship's citadel room, or secure compartment, the Bulkeley's specialist boarding team climbed aboard Saturday, detained the four men and secured the vessel, the Navy said. There was no exchange of fire at any time during the operation, and an SH-60 Seahawk helicopter supported the boarding team from the air, the Navy added. Officials said they are still deciding what to do with the suspected pirates. The U.S. Navy did not disclose the nationalities of those detained or where they were being taken. ""Through our mutual cooperation and shared coordination, CTF-151 and our partner organizations has prevented the kidnapping of legitimate mariners who sought only to go peacefully about their business,"" said CMF's counter-piracy commander, Commodore Abdul Alheem. ""Today, there will be a merchant ship sailing freely that would not be doing so were it not for the efforts of CTF-151.""

"Harf Sofyan, Yemen (CNN) -- Security forces opened fire on anti-government protesters in northern Yemen on Friday morning, killing two people and injuring nine others, witnesses said. The forces fired into the protesters in Harf Sufyan city to try and disperse them, witnesses said. Three army planes flying over the crowd also attacked the protesters, witnesses said. The vast majority of the protesters were Houthi rebels, according to Mohammed Abdulsalam, a spokesman for the group .

"(CNN)  -- Davis Cup champions Serbia will be without world No. 3 Novak Djokovic as they begin the defense of their title in the men's team competition against India this weekend. The Australian Open champion led Serbia to an historic victory over France in front of a home crowd in Belgrade in the 2010 final, but has chosen to focus on his preparations for the U.S. hard-court season rather than join his teammates for the March 4-6 first-round world group tie. However, the 23-year-old insisted that his teammates -- world No. 18 Viktor Troicki, 45th-ranked Janko Tipsarevic and double's specialists Ilija Bozoljac and Nenad Zimonjic -- remain favorites to secure victory on indoor courts in Serbia's second city Novi Sad. ""Unfortunately, this time I won't be part of the Davis Cup team. Together with my teammates and captain, I decided to rest this time but I am confident that they will win this tie and they have my full support,"" Djokovic said in a statement on his official website.

""I feel physically well, fit, and mentally motivated to do even more coming up to tournaments in Indian Wells and Miami where I haven't done well in the last years.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama defended his proposed education spending increases Friday, telling an audience of students and teachers in Florida that such investments are necessary to spur future economic growth. ""If we want more good news on the jobs front, then we need to make more investments in education,"" Obama said. ""I am not willing to give up on any child in America. ... I do not accept failure."" Obama's proposed budget for fiscal year 2012 includes an 11% hike in federal education spending, to more than $77 billion. Republican congressional leaders are seeking to reduce federal spending on education, with many arguing it should be primarily a state and local concern. Among other things, the administration has made a pledge to prepare an additional 100,000 science, technology, math and engineering teachers by the end of the decade. The White House also is pushing to make permanent the American Opportunity Tax Credit, which is worth up to $10,000 for four years of college. Seeking a political middle ground, Obama has also stressed the need for reform and, more specifically, the need to remove poorly performing teachers and school administrators. He continued to do so Friday, calling the status quo ""unacceptable."" At the same time, however, the president also appeared to criticize at Republicans such as Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who is trying to strip teachers and other public sector workers of the bulk of their collective bargaining rights. Teachers are ""feeling beat up"" right now, Obama said. ""I want to be very clear here. We are proud of what (teachers) do each and every day. We need to honor teachers."" The president appeared with Education Secretary Arne Duncan and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a Republican, at Miami Central Senior High School -- a previously underperforming school which has improved in recent years. The turnaround, Obama stressed, was done by implementing a reform plan in cooperation with the local teachers union. White House officials noted that the school was awarded nearly $785,000 in federal School Improvement Grant funds to help finance its turnaround plan. Obama has asked Congress for $900 million for a new round in the Race to the Top competition, which rewards states and localities that meet the administration's standards for educational innovation and outcomes.","Obama says more education spending is needed to spur future economic growth .

"(CNN) -- An opposition plan calling for an investigation into violence against protesters in Yemen and the  departure of the president was being reviewed by the ruling party, a government official said, and was ""being received positively"" so far. The government official, who asked not to be named, told CNN late Wednesday the plan was being ""reviewed by the GPC (Ruling Party) leadership committee."" The official's comments came as the ruling party claimed that it is continuing a dialogue with the opposition -- but the opposition denied it. ""We will not have any dialogue with the ruling party. Our only demand is that this regime leaves and then we can talk about dialogue,"" said opposition bloc spokesman Mohammed Al-Qubati. The two sides both said that the opposition delivered a list of five points to the ruling party via a committee of Islamic scholars, but did not agree on whether it was a ""plan,"" as the government says, or ""advice for the ruling party,"" as the opposition says. Opponents of Yemen's long-time President Ali Abdullah Saleh have been demonstrating against him since the beginning of the year, part of the wave of popular protests that has been crashing over the Arab world. Saleh's party says the opposition ""points"" include a demand for an investigation into who was responsible for violence against protesters, and prosecutions, plus compensation for the victims' families. They also want Saleh to step down and transfer power peacefully by the end of the year, according to the official. Saleh caused a stir Tuesday when he said in a public address that ""there is a control room working for the media and you know where it is -- in Tel Aviv. These events are managed by the White House."" The comments referring to Washington were later edited out of a rebroadcast of his speech. Saleh called the White House on Wednesday ""to convey his regret for misunderstandings related to his public remarks that Israel and the United States have engaged in destabilizing activities in Arab countries,"" a White House statement said. In the call to John Brennan, U.S. President Barack Obama's assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism, Saleh also said that he is ""firmly committed to meaningful political reform in Yemen and that he is reaching out to opposition elements in an effort to achieve reform through a democratic, inclusive, and peaceful process."" U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley rejected Saleh's remarks before the Yemeni leader retracted them. ""The protests in Yemen are not the product of external conspiracies,"" Crowley said on Twitter. ""President Saleh knows better. His people deserve a better response."" Saleh's stinging comments came as a powerful cleric -- labeled a terrorist by the United States -- joined the ranks of the Yemeni protesters Tuesday, leading them in prayer and telling them to stick to their demands. It marked the first time a radical Islamic voice had joined those calling for democracy. Sheikh Abdul Majid al-Zindani, a provocative cleric with a flaming red beard, was accused by Washington in 2004 of supplying weapons to al Qaeda. Last year, al-Zindani made a public plea to recruit millions of young men to fight jihad against Israel. But in Yemen, al-Zindani is a free and influential man and his support of the demonstrations could prove key. Saleh also fired the governors of five of the nation's provinces, where anti-government protests have been raging for several weeks. All five were appointed to other positions, according to a decree released Tuesday. The protests continued Tuesday as thousands gathered outside Sanaa University in the capital. Even members of Saleh's powerful tribal group were among the protesters calling for an end to the president's rule. In a counterdemonstration, thousands of government loyalists descended on Sanaa's Tahrir Square. Opposition to Saleh has solidified in the wake of violent confrontations between security forces and protesters Friday in Sanaa, Aden and elsewhere. Four people were killed and 26 were wounded in the clashes, according to medical officials. Amnesty International said it had reports that 11 people died in Friday's protests, bringing the overall death toll since protests began to 27. Saleh, in power since 1978, has already said he will not seek re-election but his attempts to form a unity government have run into roadblocks. The country's main opposition bloc rejected Saleh's call for calm until elections to replace him are held. The bloc said its goal is simply ""the fall of the regime."" The nation has been battling al Qaeda as well as a Shiite uprising and secessionist movement. High unemployment, lack of political freedoms and government corruption have also stoked Yemeni anger.

"(CNN) -- Ivory Coast defender Kolo Toure has been suspended by his club Manchester City after testing positive for a banned substance. The 29-year-old, who joined City from English Premier League rivals Arsenal in 2009, learned of his failed drugs test from the English Football Association (FA) on Thursday. ""Manchester City confirm that the FA has informed Kolo Toure that an 'A-sample' provided by him has tested positive for a specified substance,"" a statement published on the club's official website read. It continued: ""As result of this, he has been suspended from participating in all first team and non-first team matches pending the outcome of the legal process. ""There will be no further comment from the football club at this stage."" According to the World Anti-Doping Agency a specified substance is one which could have ""a credible, non-doping explanation."" Punishments for a positive test range from a warning to a two-year ban from sport. Toure has made more than 50 appearances for City and was captain of the side last season. He is contracted at the club -- where his younger brother Yaya also plays -- until 2013. Elsewhere in the Premier League, leaders Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson has been charged with improper conduct by the FA over comments he made about referee Martin Atkinson on Tuesday .

He added: ""You want a fair referee, or a strong referee anyway -- and we didn't get that."" The Scot criticized Atkinson for not sending off Chelsea goalscorer David Luiz for fouls on Wayne Rooney and Javier Hernandez, as well as for awarding what proved to be a decisive penalty late in the match. Ferguson already has a suspended two-game touchline ban hanging over him from 2009 when he said that Alan Wiley was not physically fit enough to referee in the Premier League. A statement on the FA website stated that Ferguson has until next Tuesday to respond to the charge.","Manchester City ban defender Kolo Toure after he tests positive for drugs .

"(CNN) -- The Ohio state Senate passed a bill Wednesday that would curb the collective bargaining rights of public workers and strip away their power to strike. Lawmakers approved the measure by a count of 17 to 16, with six Republicans voting in opposition. The bill, known as Senate Bill 5, is supported by Republican Governor John Kasich. It would curb a 1983 Ohio state law that affords collective bargaining rights to public employees. ""No surprise,"" said Senate President Tom Niehaus. ""I've been saying for weeks that we have the votes to pass this bill. It reflects the diverse interests that our members have around the state of Ohio,"" he said. The near-500-page proposal was modified Tuesday with Republican-supported amendments cobbled into a single omnibus package. Modifications include new measures to settle workplace arbitration, limits on worker vacation and an end to their ability to negotiate health care and automatic pay raises based on seniority. The amended legislation would also restore collective bargaining rights on wages but ban strikes by all public-sector workers, imposing fines and terminating employment contracts for those who defy the ban. Democratic lawmakers described the proposal as union-busting. Their GOP counterparts argued that it's needed to tackle an overreach of union influence they regard as an impediment to fiscal reform. ""It passed by the most narrowest of margin,"" said Democratic State Senator Joe Schiavoni. ""That really shows how much public outcry on this bill. That they can change a 27-year-old law in three weeks is scary."" Meanwhile, protesting crowds gathered in Columbus, Ohio, chanting slogans like ""Shame on you!"" following the Senate vote. Earlier Wednesday the measure sailed through a Senate Labor Committee following a last-minute GOP shuffle that resulted in the replacement of Republican Senator Bill Seitz. Seitz said he mostly supported the bill, and the need for collective bargaining reform, but disagreed with a provision that would allow employer management to ""impose its will on the final terms of the contract when fact-finding and mediation fail."" ""That violates the fundamental principle that one cannot be simultaneously a judge and an advocate in his own cause,"" he said, calling for an ""elected, independent, neutral"" party to adjudicate those cases involving state workers. The bill now moves onto the Republican-controlled House where lawmakers are expected to take up the measure on March 10. Ohio, often considered a battleground for presidential politics, faces an $8 billion shortfall in the next two-year budget.

"(CNN) -- The Scottish Police Federation (SPF) has called for an end to the ""madness"" of Old Firm matches after a fractious clash between Glasgow rivals Rangers and Celtic. The Scottish Cup clash at Celtic Park on Wednesday was marred by three red cards for Rangers players and a series of running battles on the touchline. Celtic won the game 1-0 but manager Neil Lennon clashed with Rangers striker El-Hadji Diouf during the match and Rangers assistant manager Ally McCoist after the final whistle. Strathclyde Police said there were 34 arrests in the ground for sectarian offences, racial abuse and breach of the peace. The derby between the two old foes is especially incendiary due to the historical religious divide between the two clubs -- Celtic supporters are largely Catholic while Rangers supporters are usually of Protestant background. The trouble on Wednesday night led the head of the Scottish Football Association (SFA) to say he was ""saddened and deeply embarrassed"" by the scenes while SPF chairman Les Gray said police were struggling to cope. Mr Gray told CNN: ""We simply don't have the money and resources to do this. Everyone involved needs to sit down and look at this. Something has to give. This madness cannot go on. ""What happens on the pitch is reproduced throughout Scotland, on the streets, in pubs, in homes. You cannot justify it. It can't keep on going."" Scotland's Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill was quoted by the UK Press Association as saying: ""There is a deep-rooted and unacceptable social issue involved -- which has a great deal to do with Scotland's damaging relationship with alcohol, and little to do with football. ""The issue is far wider than clubs and the game. It is about a culture of violence fueled by alcohol."" The SFA confirmed they had launched an investigation with chief executive Stewart Regan criticizing ""inflammatory and irresponsible behavior"" during the match. In a statement on the SFA's website he said: ""As chief executive of this organization, I was both saddened and deeply embarrassed to witness the scenes that unfolded during what is supposed to be Scottish football's flagship fixture: these images were broadcast around the world and shows our game in a poor light. ""I acknowledge the pressures of expectation on both clubs but last night's behavior crossed the boundaries of acceptable conduct at a football match. ""The unedifying sight of two of the country's most recognizable and respected coaches engaged in an angry confrontation was not only unsavoury but exacerbated an already incendiary atmosphere inside the stadium and throughout the West of Scotland.""","Scottish Police Federation call for an end to the ""madness"" of fractious Old Firm matches .

"Boston, Massachusetts (CNN) -- A Massachusetts court added $81 million in punitive damages Thursday to $71 million in compensatory damages it had already awarded to the family of a woman who died of lung cancer. Suffolk Superior Court ruled earlier this week that Lorillard Tobacco Company lured black children into smoking by providing them free cigarettes. The plaintiff, Willie Evans, said the company handed out Newport cigarettes to children like his mother, Marie Evans, during the late 1950s and early 1960s in the Orchard Park neighborhood of Boston. ""It's certainly bittersweet,"" Evans said. ""If I had my choice, I would have preferred the tobacco company not to have given my mother cigarettes as a 9-year-old child."" Marie Evans died at age 54 after suffering from small cell lung cancer, according to the criminal complaint. Her family said that Lorillard ""developed techniques to manipulate and control the nicotine delivery of its cigarettes so as to create and sustain addiction in smokers, including Marie Evans."" according to the complaint. Lorillard says those claims are unfounded. The company is the third largest manufacturer of cigarettes in the United States, according to a company statement. It said it plans to appeal. ""Lorillard respectfully disagrees with the jury's verdict and denies the plaintiff's claim that the company sampled to children or adults at Orchard Park in the early 1960s,"" said spokesman Gregg Perry. Jurors listened to a video deposition from Evans recorded three weeks before her death in 2002 in which she described receiving cigarettes from Lorillard when she was a child. ""Hopefully this does allow other people to come forward, and gives them confidence to move their cases forward,"" Evans said after tearfully embracing his attorney when the verdict was read. But Lorillard contends that Evans' ""50-year-old memories were persuasively contradicted by testimony from several witnesses,"" Perry said. The jury had deliberated for approximately two hours on Thursday, after listening to expert financial and forensic testimony.","NEW: Jurors listened to a video deposition from Evans recorded three weeks before her death .

"(CNN) -- Kim Byung-ki has just seen his sister for the first time in 59 years, a sibling he thought was dead until last year. They reunited over the weekend for the first time since the Korean War tore apart their family. Kim, his sister and Kim's son started crying immediately on seeing one another, said Kim's son, Kim Jong-hwa. They couldn't stop. The family took part in family reunions that began October 30 and will end Friday at Mount Kumgang, the two Koreas' joint mountain resort in the North. Many burst into tears at the reunions, which involve 100 people from each side. Elderly men in suits and women in traditional Korean silk hanbok dresses sat at numbered tables in a large restaurant. Some sat, spoke and exchanged photographs; others simply looked bewildered as they clutched hands and stared into faces unseen for six decades. The relatives have been separated from since the 1950-53 Korean War. ""After a while, my father said they need to stop crying and smile, so the memories of the meeting could be better. He said they should say goodbye smiling, not crying. It was hard to see that,"" Kim Jong-hwa said. Kim's father wasn't immediately available for comment. ""We were very happy to meet her and learn about how she had lived,"" Kim Jong-hwa said of his aunt. ""I felt relieved to hear she had worked as a nurse and later became a doctor, that probably means she had a better life"" than many North Koreans. ""Still, it broke my hear to see her and think of the difficulties she might have gone through,"" Kim said. ""She told us that when the North and South Korean family meetings started, she was upset that no one in her family had looked for her,"" he said. ""It was a shock for us to hear she felt that way,"" Kim said. ""We did our best to explain to her we thought she had died during the war and that we would have tried to look for her, had we known she was still out there. When she left, she said she understood, but I wondered what she really thought and how she really felt."" The elder Kim had not seen his sister since 1951, when she was 15 years old. He was a police officer during the war and often was away from home. When he returned one day, ""She was gone. I asked where she was and she had been kidnapped [by North Korean soldiers]. After that, we didn't know where she was,"" Kim said. ""My mother was just waiting for her to get back. She was old. She couldn't go out to look for her. Even if she wanted, she didn't even know where she could search,"" Kim added. ""It was a vague hope. She wondered, will it be today? Will it be tomorrow? She just waited."" Kim's wife, Kwon Bong-sook, shared her memories of those traumatic years: . ""All the family was alive then. Three generations lived at the house and people waited for her to come back."" ""But time passed, we weren't able to think. There were shootings, bombs, the men went to the army. ... I didn't even know if my husband was alive."" ""Life was hard then. That was how we lived then. My brother and my father were also gone. Everything was taken from us. We didn't have food."" ""There were bombs. It was not a proper life. We just tried to survive. After this, we thought she died. We could have never imagined she survived."" Last year, the South Korean Kim got word through government channels that his sister was alive, in North Korea. No mail, telephone or e-mail exchanges exist between ordinary citizens across the Korean border, so the siblings pinned their hopes on the government-sanctioned reunions. Millions of Koreans were divided by the war. It ended in a truce, but without a formal peace treaty. The prickly relationship between the countries has since had periodic conciliatory moves and flare-ups. Some 80,000 South Koreans have registered with their government to join one of the infrequent reunions, but 40,000 people are thought to have passed away or given up hope, according to the South's Ministry of Unification. Numbers are unknown in the secretive North. The first family reunions took place following a landmark summit between the two Koreas in 2000. Since then, 17,100 people representing 3,500 families have been reunited on 17 separate occasions. Journalist Manisha Tank contributed to this report.","Until last year, Kim Byung-ki thought his sister was dead .

"(CNN) -- With violence approaching their doorstep, 10-year-old Beverly Dempsey and her father had eight hours to gather their belongings into one suitcase apiece and evacuate Egypt during last month's uprising. Her mother, a U.S. State Department employee, had to stay behind while they were relocated to temporary housing in Falls Church, Virginia, with other displaced diplomatic families. Jim Dempsey tries to make life as normal as possible for his daughter, who is attending school for the first time in the United States, having lived abroad since she was 2. But her heart remains in Egypt, the place she's come to regard as home. ""I really like it here, but it would have made me feel better if we were in Egypt because that's where I want to be right now,"" she says. ""I want to go back really badly, but that doesn't mean I don't like it here. I just want to be able to say goodbye."" The Dempseys are among the many diplomatic families wait in limbo for word on when they can return to Egypt. Jim Dempsey, an economic development consultant, says he is grateful to the U.S. government for making the transition as smooth as possible in a community that has been welcoming and supportive. But it's been more than a month since they left Egypt and he's anxious to resume the life he left behind. ""We've been living in Egypt for four years. It's our home. This is place is fine, but everything is there. We have a set of friends, we have a way of living, and all of that is disrupted. We have to adjust and do well, wherever you go, but you want to be at home."" The two speak daily with Jim's wife, a USAID employee on essential work in Cairo. She has told them things are still tense in the Egyptian capital -- there's still the occasional gunfire; roadblocks are still up; people are hesitant to go far from their homes. But life is slowly returning to normal, with 70 percent of schools up and running, including Beverly's school, Cairo American College, Dempsey says. Beverly's room contains her most cherished mementos of the life she left behind: some stuffed animals, medals from her accomplishments as a swimmer, photos with her parents from their adventures in India and Ethiopia -- where they lived prior to Egypt. She also brought along a small statue of Ramses, the Egyptian pharaoh. ""I don't have a lot of statues of things, and it was small but it also reminded me of the Great Pharaohs and how they lived through a lot of hard things, so I sort of related to them,"" she says. She misses her friends, her teachers, and ""all these amazing sights that most people aren't able to see."" But most of all, she says, she misses her mother. ""It would have been easier for us all to adjust with my mom here because she sort of is the one who does a lot of things. She helps us shop, she helps us decorate ...  and so cook. My dad's not a very good cook."" Jim Dempsey says that, given the situation in Egypt, he hopes to return sometime in the next month. ""We're kind of waiting, trying to figure out what to do in the meantime. My job is to work as a single parent and take my care of my daughter.""

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo grabbed a hat-trick as Real Madrid crushed Malaga 7-0 to close the gap on Spanish league leaders Barcelona. The Portuguese striker ended his four-match goal drought in style as Jose Mourinho's side reduced Barca's advantage at the top of La Liga to seven points. Second-bottom Malaga had no answer to a powerful attacking display and finished the game with nine men after defender Manolo was sent off and Cala limped off injured after they had made all their permitted substitutions. Malaga coach Manuel Pelligrini, who was replaced at Real Madrid by Mourinho, chose to rest some of his best players and the decision came back to haunt him at the Bernabeu. France international Karim Benzema began the rout after 27 minutes when he diverted Xabi Alonso's free kick into the net. Angel Di Maria added a second nine minutes later after capitalizing on a missed interception to slot the ball into the bottom corner. Just before the break Marcelo slammed Di Maria's pass into the corner of the net to make it 3-0. There was no let up after the interval as Ronaldo rounded off a flowing move to register a fourth before Benzema got his second with a header from Marcelo's cross. Manolo handled in the area to give Real a penalty and was shown a second yellow card by the referee. Ronaldo made no mistake from the spot. And the striker completed his hat-trick by converting Sergio Canales' cross at the near post with 13 minutes remaining before asking to be substituted.","Real Madrid beat Malaga 7-0 in Spain's La Liga .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli police arrested two suspects Saturday in connection to a deadly wildfire raging in the country's north, though a police spokesman said it appears the fires started out of negligence. The fires have killed 41 and injured 17 others. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the suspects are being questioned at a local police station but police now believe the fires were due to negligence rather than arson. As the police probe unfolded, firefighters continued to battle three major blazes fueled by shifting winds. The fire, the worst in Israel's history, is still not under control, Rosenfeld said. The flames spread over 10,000 acres around Haifa, Israel's third largest city, threatening businesses, tourism and one of Israel's greenest regions, Mount Carmel. ""If you look over the hills at Haifa, you can see smoke billowing over the sea,"" said Rosenfeld, adding that the winds have forced authorities to close down roads to the coastal area. About 17,000 people have been evacuated, but residential areas are not under threat, he said. On Saturday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu referred to the help Israel received from other nations, including Egypt, Turkey and Jordan, as ""heartwarming,"" the Jerusalem Post reported. ""One thing is clear, the Israeli people are standing together and many, many countries are together with Israel. This is no small thing,"" Netanyahu said during a press conference. ""This is surely a point of light in this our festival of lights Hanukkah,"" he said. Israeli's military noted in a statement Saturday that firefighters from Bulgaria and Greece had joined Israeli personnel on the blaze's frontlines. Netanyahu's office said that so far, several nations have committed 10 airplanes and three helicopters to help Israel fight the raging fire, including four from Greece, one from Cyprus, two from Turkey, two from Russia and one from France. These are in addition to several Israel Defense Forces aircraft, including two to four charged with surveying the region from above. British Prime Minister David Cameron instructed the Royal Air Force to deploy two helicopters from Cyprus to help put out the fire, British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Friday. Netanyahu spoke Saturday morning with the president of Switzerland to recruit additional air support, his office said. Five U.S. Defense Department aircraft will leave for Israel this weekend to help fight the fire. They include three C-130 firefighting aircraft from the U.S. Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard and two C-130s from the U.S. European Command, which will depart Ramstein Air Base in Germany carrying 20 tons of fire retardant, the U.S. Agency for International Development said. The agency said it has already chartered commercial aircraft to deliver 45 tons of fire retardant and 12,000 liters of foam to suppress the flames. A team of experts from the U.S. Forest Service's Disaster Assistance Support Program is also heading to Israel, the agency said. Hague expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and to the thousands who have had to be evacuated because of the blaze. ""This tragedy is all the more sad as it comes as the Jewish community around the world celebrates Hanukkah, a time of hope and joy,"" Hague said. ""The UK will continue to do whatever it can to help."" Two funerals took place Saturday after another eight were held Friday for those killed, Rosenfeld said. Most of the 41 victims were cadets in Israel's prison service who arrived Thursday to help evacuate 500 inmates from the Damon prison near Haifa. Among the dead, 40 were apparently burned alive when their bus, traveling along a narrow mountain road, was engulfed by the fast-moving blaze, the Jerusalem Post reported. In an interview with the newspaper, a firefighter spokesman said the bus was gone in less than three minutes. ""The bus had no chance. They tried to escape but were burned alive,"" the spokesman said. ""It was a horrific scene."" The IDF said the victims will be buried with full honors in military ceremonies. Israeli firefighter spokesman Yoram Levy said shifting 29 kph (18 mph) winds made the inferno harder to control as flames neared a neighborhood in Haifa, a major tourist destination on the northern coast. Built on the slopes of Mount Carmel about 50 miles north of Tel Aviv, Haifa's metropolitan area is also host to historical sites that date to Biblical times. The fire has also threatened a sensitive ecological area near the Hai Bar nature reserve. Known as Mount Carmel's ""Little Switzerland,"" the reserve is home to a wildlife preservation project that seeks to bring back native species mentioned in the Old Testament. Though Israel is known for its military might, it has been criticized for failing to properly handle the blazes.

"(CNN) -- Colombia's soccer officials announced Wednesday they will suspend a defender for the Deportivo Pereira for two games and fine him $560 for kicking an owl on the Junior Barranquilla home field on Sunday. The bird, a mascot for the Junior Barranquilla team, had landed on the field during a game shortly before Luis Moreno trotted over to it and launched it aloft with his foot. It landed a few yards away. Monday, it died. ""The animal was practically a symbol for the Barranquillera fan and, given that the aggression occurred in their own stadium and in direct view of all the assistants, such an attitude can validly be interpreted as being within the range of public provocation that is regulated by the disciplinary code of the Colombian Football Federation,"" soccer officials said in a statement.

"Miami (CNN) -- State investigators concluded there were ""no safety threats"" at the home of a 10-year-old girl two days before she was found dead in her adoptive father's pick-up truck near her seriously ill twin brother, according to a report released Monday by Florida child welfare authorities. Both of the twins' adoptive parents -- mother Carmen Barahona and father Jorge Barahona -- are charged with first-degree murder in the girl's death. They also each face seven counts of aggravated child abuse and seven counts of child neglect, with the mother being so charged Saturday and the father charged on all the counts Monday. James Loftus, director of the Miami-Dade Police Department, told reporters Monday that the girl died and the boy was found only after an extended period of ""systemic long-term abuse."" ""This is, in my experience, one of the saddest commentaries on the human condition that I've ever seen,"" Loftus said, calling the parents' alleged behavior ""subhuman."" ""It's depressing, it's sickening."" Jorge Barahona earlier pleaded not guilty on charges of attempted first-degree murder with a weapon and aggravated child abuse with a weapon in the case. Days before the twins were found, the Florida Department of Children and Families received tips alleging poor treatment of children at the Barahona household in Miami-Dade County. Records indicate a 7-year-old also lived in the home. One caller on February 10 claimed that the 10-year-old girl and another child had been ""tied by their hands and feet with tape, and made to stay in the bathtub all day and night as a form of punishment,"" with the tape removed only so they could eat, according to a copy of the report released Monday. Then, on February 12, authorities began looking into another claim that one of the Barahonas' children needed stitches after being hurt on the face and lip. Carmen Barahona applied a bandage but didn't take the child to the hospital. The mother said the child fell -- though the report notes that ""the injury is not consistent with the story."" Investigators went to the home and late that night filed a report, in which they did not find any reasons for concern for the children's well-being. ""There is no reason to believe that the family is about to flee or refuse access to the children,"" investigator Bridget Moore said in the ""initial in home safety assessment"" report. ""The home was observed, and there were no hazardous conditions."" The report concluded with an assessment that the risk to the children was ""moderate,"" with no risk of abuse. ""There are no concerns for the safety of the children while in the care of the parents,"" the investigator writes. Two days later, on February 14, authorities say Jorge Barahona parked his pest-control truck alongside I-95. A roadside ranger said he found Barahona beside the truck and his adopted son ill inside the vehicle, which was filled with toxic chemicals. The boy was taken to a hospital to be treated for severe burns. The body of the Barahonas' adopted daughter, Nubia -- who was the boy's twin sister -- was later discovered in the back of the truck in a plastic bag. The Florida Department of Children and Families held its fourth of five scheduled meetings Monday afternoon to examine how authorities had handled the case. In one instance, a caller told Florida authorities that he knew the Barahonas, and he was worried about the couple's twins. The contents of that phone call, which was made two days before the twins were found, was released last  week by the department. The caller said he was worried that something sinister had happened to the 10-year-old girl because the Barahonas could not explain where the girl was. ""(Jorge Barahona) doesn't come out with a straight answer, which is worrying me so much that something might have happened to that little girl,"" said the caller, who was not named. During Monday's press conference, Katherine Fernandez Rundle -- the state attorney for Miami-Dade -- said the surviving children in the Barahonas' home ""clearly are key witnesses"" in the case, describing their cooperation with investigators thus far as ""very courageous."" Rundle said a decision hasn't been made yet on whether prosecutors would seek a death sentence in this case, though she signalled that this scenario appeared likely. ""If there ever was a case that the death penalty would apply, it would seem to apply to this one,"" she said.","NEW: A Florida man, like his wife, is charged with murder and child abuse .

"(CNN) -- South Korea will attempt a second time to send a group of North Koreans back to the communist North on Monday, according to the Red Cross. The effort comes three days after North Korea refused accept the same group. The North rejected the first attempt by the South to repatriate 27 of the North Koreans over four defectors, who decided remain behind in South Korea. The North has demanded the return of the whole group of 31 -- including the defectors, according to South Korea's official news agency Yonhap. The North Koreans accidentally crossed over into South Korean waters on a fishing boat in early February. The defections have become a new point of tension between the Koreas. Defection is a crime in North Korea that carries the death penalty, according to Yonhap. North Korea on Monday proposed working-level Red Cross talks regarding repatriation, according to a South Korean Red Cross news release. South Korea has accepted the proposal for talks but rejected a key demand by the North. The North Korean Red Cross plans to bring three family members of the four North Korean defectors to the meeting, according to the news release, and demand that the South Koreans bring the four defectors to the meeting with them. The South Korean government reaffirmed its intention Monday not to repatriate the four North Korean defectors, Yonhap reported. ""There is no change in our basic position that a decision made based on the free will of a person must be respected,"" said South Korean Unification Ministry spokesman Chun Hae-sung in the Yonhap report. South Korea's intelligence agency questioned the North Koreans for about a month since they crossed over in early February before deciding to release the group, the Korean Red Cross said. There are currently more than 20,000 North Korean defectors in South Korea, according to the South's Unification Ministry. The number of annual defectors has risen dramatically since the turn of the century and continues to climb. Defectors who are forcefully repatriated to the North after attempting to cross over into third countries such as China, Mongolia or Southeast Asia are commonly sent to prison camps as a punishment. Many defectors who live in South Korea fear for the lives of their family or relatives who remain in the North.

"(CNN) -- At one time, teens Carlos Gonzalez, 16, and Juan Carlos Echeverri, 15, were classmates at Cathedral High School in El Paso, Texas. Like many who live along the border, both boys had strong ties to El Paso, and especially to neighboring Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. That's where they found themselves on Saturday, where they were gunned down at a car dealership by unknown assailants. Gonzalez and Echeverri were both U.S. citizens, the Cathedral principal told CNN. A third youth, 16-year-old Cesar Miramontes of Juarez was also killed in the incident. ""Like many kids involved in this border reality of straddling two cultures, he had a lot of stress about what's going on in Juarez,"" the high school principal, Brother Nick Gonzalez, said of Gonzalez. The two are not related. The young Gonzalez, the principal said, was ""mischievous, but a good kid."" His family, which had lived in Juarez, had recently started renting an apartment in El Paso for safety reasons. Juarez is a flashpoint in the drug cartel turf wars that have left thousands dead over the past four years. There were more than 3,000 killings recorded in Juarez alone in 2010. Moving to the United States, for any child, is a cultural shift, and ""I think he struggled with that,"" the principal said. Echeverri went to school with Gonzalez at Cathedral their freshman year, before he returned to Juarez to attend school there, the principal said. The shooting happened at 4:22 p.m. Saturday at a car dealership, where the teens were looking at cars, said Arturo Sandoval, spokesman for the Chihuahua state attorney general's office. Police recovered at least 18 bullet casings at the scene from an AK-47, an automatic weapon commonly used by drug traffickers in the city. ""We believe (Echeverri) and the two others had been friends for a long time. He was here in the city to visit them,"" Sandoval said. Virginia Staab, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, said Monday that U.S. authorities are actively looking into the incident and had not yet confirmed the citizenship of any of the victims. Even though the killings happened in Juarez, they re-open wounds for the students and the community of El Paso, Nick Gonzalez, the principal, said. Seemingly everyone knows someone who has been killed, extorted, kidnapped or robbed, he said. Just because the violence is on the Mexican side of the border, doesn't make it a Mexican problem, he said. ""It is not a 'them' problem, it is an 'us' problem. We need to find out how to help kids cope,"" he said. ""Just because there is a border doesn't mean that the emotions and pain don't cross over."" Monday's killings marked the first time that a current student at Cathedral High School was killed in the Juarez violence. But alumni have been killed before, and, just before Christmas, the father of a student -- a successful orthopedic surgeon in Juarez -- was kidnapped and killed. The fatal shootings come on the heels of numerous similar violent incidents in recent months in Juarez. In one 48-hour span last week, for instance, at least 14 people were killed -- including a municipal police officer and a newspaper vendor who police believe was targeted due to her job, according to Juarez Police spokesman Adrian Sanchez.","Three teens killed Saturday at a car dealership in Ciudad Juarez .

"(CNN) -- In 2000, I moved to Senegal for the third and last time with my five grandchildren and husband, jazz musician Sam Sanders. Their mother had passed on five years before from a heart attack and their father was still distraught. We decided to give our grandchildren an international multilingual and multicultural education. I had spent 30 years in and out of many African countries, designing health, education and nutrition programs, and had lived in many places and discovered many cultures. We decided on Kaolack, a town in the western part of Senegal. The local religious leaders are very tolerant of all religions, creeds, and nationalities. After we arrived, our grandchildren started to become accustomed to the varied lifestyle. Then, my husband, who was my best friend, died. I retired from life. I spent my days in prayer, reflection and education of the grandchildren. My mourning period had began, and I assumed it would continue all my remaining life. In late spring 2001, Mame Gueda Agne, a 9-year-old playmate of my granddaughter, came and asked to join the grandkids home-schooled classes. She stated simply that she had failed the third grade the year before, was failing this year, and afraid that she would be thrown out of school. In Senegal, if a child fails two successive years in public school he or she is expelled. Only if parents can afford private school education will the child be able to continue. I explained to her that she was in the Senegalese school system and the grandkids' classes were not the same. In fact, the last thing I wanted was for an outside child to interrupt my mourning rituals. But, Mame Gueda continued to come and ask. Finally, I took Mame Gueda to speak with her mother to stop her asking. Her mother explained that the girl was not intelligent and would probably fail. She stated that she would let her finish this school year, then keep her home to teach her how to be a good wife and mother. I could not accept that fate for a little girl who only wanted me to assist her. I asked her mother to allow me to work with her. Even though I had not mastered the Senegalese educational system, I thought that with my local contacts I could find someone to help Mame Gueda. The next day Mame Gueda arrived for schooling. But she did not come alone. She came with three other girls. In two weeks, I had 20 little 9-year-old girls. My mourning period was over. I researched the whys and wherefores of the little girls' educational failures. I found that of every 60,000 girls who enter first grade, only 4,500 finish primary school in the region of Kaolack. Of those 4,500 students entering middle school, only 1,500 will enter high school. Five hundred will graduate with a high school diploma, 150 will enter university, and 15 will receive their university degree. I discovered that many girls do not have books and school supplies, or the time or a place to study after school. I began haunting all the public and private development agencies, local and national government institutions, asking for assistance to support our little girls. I was refused. We were not part of an established program or in the wrong area, or we were turned down for innumerable other reasons. We started teaching ourselves. There is always someone who knows something that another does not. We made sure that everyone knew the basics: read, write, cipher. I drew upon competency based educational techniques I had learned at Columbia University Teacher's College. We had to rely on ourselves. In the fall of 2001 the girls wanted me to continue the program. I informed them that I hadn't been able to find the money. They said they could raise their own money. They had seen American girls on television selling cookies and would imitate them. So I began ""cookie classes."" The girls sold cookies and fruit punch. They raised enough to buy their school books and supplies. The little girls brought in older siblings and relatives who had already failed and been expelled from school. The older girls did the cooking and selling. They became our financial support and grew into our entrepreneurs. The little girls returned to school. I knew that in order for them not to fail again, they had to keep learning. We involved our girls' parents to make sure they allowed them the time to study after school by reducing household chores. We involved the community by getting it to allocate public spaces and buildings to hold our afterschool classes and programs. Eventually we got public and private financial and technical support to expand the number of girls that we teach each year. We now have 3,383 girls and want to increase our numbers to 5,000 this year. We export five blended hibiscus teas, dolls and household products to pay for the schooling. We have decided to become green, with an aggressive environmental education and agricultural development entrepreneurial program. We have 20 girls in university. We do not recruit. They find us.

"(CNN) -- Japan recovered from having a player sent off to snatch a last-gasp 3-2 win over Asian Cup hosts Qatar in Doha and reach the semifinals on Friday. Masahiko Inoha's late goal ended Qatar's hopes of qualifying for the last four of the competition for the first time, and maintained Japan's dream of earning a record fourth title. Albert Zaccheroni's team will next face either Group D winners Iran or Group C runners-up South Korea, who face off on Saturday. ""After we lost a man we still had more possession,"" the Italian coach told the Asian Cup website. ""It was a great comeback and I could see the good mentality from our players. ""Even though we were a man down, normally teams think about defense, but we didn't -- we had the bravery to keep attacking."" Qatar, ranked 105th in the world, had reached the knockout stage for just the second time in seven appearances and looked capable of going one better than 2000's last-eight showing when substitute Fabio Cesar made it 2-1 straight after Maya Yoshida's 62nd-minute dismissal. Exiled Iran coach aims for historic goal . But Japan battled back as Shinji Kagawa equalized with 20 minutes to play, and the striker was also involved when Inoha scored at the death. Qatar took the lead in the 12th minute when Uruguay-born striker Sebastian Soria beat the offside trap, cut inside past defender Inoha and fired past goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima. Japan, the second-highest ranked team at the 16-team tournament behind fellow 2010 World Cup qualifiers Australia, leveled in the 28th minute through Kagawa. The 21-year-old, who plays for German league leaders Borussia Dortmund, headed home a cross by Shinji Okazaki as the teams went to the break on equal terms. But that balance of power was disrupted 17 minutes after halftime when Yoshida fouled Yusef Ahmed on the edge of the penalty area and Cesar curled in a low effort from the resulting freekick. However, Kagawa claimed his second as he went past Mesaad Ali and beat goalkeeper Qasem Burhan, then his late burst into the box resulted in the ball running free to fullback Inoha for the goal that put Japan through. Qatar coach Bruno Metsu said he would let his players recharge before the beginning of qualifiers for the 2014 World Cup in June. ""We will use the time to let the players rest and raise their morale, because they were disappointed to lose. We can be proud of how we played,"" the Frenchman said. ""We frightened them and we were very skilful. We have shown the whole world that Qatar is a strong team. We showed that we can play good football, although we still made mistakes and we conceded goals because of these mistakes."" Group A winners Uzbekistan beat Group B runners-up Jordan 2-1 in Friday's second quarterfinal in front of 16,000 fans at Doha's 40,000-capacity Khalifa Stadium. Uzbekistan will next face either Australia or defending champions Iraq after reaching the semis for the first time, having made it to the last eight in 2004 and 2007. After a goalless first half, the ""White Wolves"" scored twice in two minutes after the break as striker Ulugbek Bakaev netted on 47 and 49. The 32-year-old, who played for Russain club CSKA Moscow earlier in his career, broke the deadlock with a header from captain Server Djeparov's free-kick and then stole in at the near post to convert a low cross. Jordan, also seeking to reach the semifinals for the first time, hit back through Bashar Bani Yaseen in the 57th minute when the defender pounced on a loose ball to score from close range.","Japan defender Masahiko Inoha scores last-minute goal to settle quarterfinal clash .

"(Mother Nature Network) -- Cobblestone streets, sidewalk cafes and public art have helped Quebec City earn the moniker, ""Paris without the jetlag."" The thriving urban agriculture scene, local boutiques and restaurants, electric buses and green hotels should inspire a new nickname: ""Europe without the carbon footprint."" Quebec City is one of the oldest cities in North America. Situated on the banks of the St. Lawrence River, it was founded in 1608 as one of the first significant settlements in Canada. The Historic District of Old Quebec -- an area of cobblestone streets, picturesque churches and upscale shops -- was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985. Once dubbed ""The Most Sustainable City in Canada,"" Quebec City has undertaken numerous green initiatives, including a citywide composting program to reduce waste that was launched in 2010. The city's two major festivals -- Festival d'été de Québec (Summer Festival) and Carnaval de Québec (winter carnival) have made commitments to the environment that include onsite recycling and composting, reusing construction material from past installations and choosing sites that are accessible by bicycle and public transportation. These efforts have helped put the French-speaking city on the map as a historic and eco-friendly destination. Experience 'la ville verte' (the green city) Quebec City is a walkable destination and it's possible to explore most of the major tourist sites on foot. For longer distances -- or to avoid the steep steps between Upper Town and Lower Town -- hop on one of the electric minibuses. Introduced in 2008, the minibuses are smaller than conventional buses, making it easier to navigate the narrow roads in the historic districts.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A prosecutor in the involuntary manslaughter case against Dr. Conrad Murray asked the judge Thursday to delay the trial, which is set to begin in a month. Murray, who is charged in the death of pop star Michael Jackson, invoked his right to a speedy trial within 60 days of his arraignment, but the prosecution complained the defense has not met its duty to share information about potential witnesses. ""I do not take notes when talking to a witness,"" defense lawyer Michael Flanigan told Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor during a hearing Thursday. Judge Pastor scolded Flanagan and his co-cousel Ed Chernoff for not providing more details to the prosecution about the testimony they expect from the 93 people listed as potential defense witnesses. ""There are sanctions, including monetary and continuances, and also including preclusion of a witness,"" the judge warned. Judge Pastor appeared caught by surprise at Murray's arraignment last month when defense lawyers invoked his right to hava a trial within 60 days. Flanagan, outside of court Thursday, said the defense will be ready when jury selection is scheduled to start on March 24. ""The defendant has a right to go to trial within 60 days,"" he said.  ""I don't think there's any obligation for him to be completely ready 30 days before he's set to go to trial, if that were the true then what would we do the last 30 days?"" Judge Pastor ordered Murray's lawyers to create written summaries of what they've been told by witnesses in interviews. ""I guess we'll have to go out and take some more statements and tell the prosecution a little buit more about where we're coming from,"" Flanagan said. Judge Pastor set a hearing for Monday morning to consider the prosecution request for a delay. The judge also delayed making a decision until next week on allowing a new lawyer to join Murray's defense team until he can determine if there is a conflict of interest. The lawyer, Nareg Gourjian, had worked on Michael Jackson's child molestation defense. Murray wants Gourjian to replace Joseph Low, who left the defense team earlier this month. Gourjian's former law firm, headed by lawyer Mark Geragos, raised the possible conflict of interest because the firm represented Jackson for two years starting in 2003, when he was charged with child molestation. Geragos, and Michael Jackson estate's lawyer, Howard Weitzman, appeared in court Thursday to discuss the matter. But Judge Pastor asked them to return next week to meet privately because it involves ""very sensitive material."" Gourjian told the judge last week that he was ""in no way involved"" in the Jackson case because he was ""a brand-new lawyer"" busy working on the a murder case at the time. Jackson died on June 25, 2009 from what the coroner ruled was an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol.","Prosecutors complain the defense has not shared witness notes .

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid reduced Barcelona's Spanish league lead to two points with a comfortable 2-0 victory at home to lowly Levante on Saturday, reaching a remarkable milestone for coach Jose Mourinho. First-half goals from Karim Benzema and Ricardo Carvalho were enough to give Mourinho's team a 19th victory in 24 La Liga games this season. The victory extended Real's unbeaten home La Liga run under Mourinho to 12 matches -- now 148 in total since his only career home league defeat when in charge of Porto on February 23, 2002. Mourinho has carried his incredible record through spells with English club Chelsea and European champions Inter Milan into his first season at the Santiago Bernabeu. Spanish titleholders Barcelona will seek to bounce back from Tuesday's Champions League defeat by Arsenal and last weekend's surprise draw with Sporting Gijon when Athletic Bilbao visit the Camp Nou on Sunday. Benzema, meanwhile, staked his claim for a starting place against his former club Lyon this coming Tuesday, when Real travel to France seeking revenge for last season's last-16 defeat in Europe's top club competition. Lyon warm up for Real clash with win . The 23-year-old has been vying for a place with loan signing Emmanuel Adebayor in the absence of the injured Gonzalo Higuain, and he scored his third league goal this season from close range after a superb run down the right by winger Angel Di Maria. Real dominated after that sixth-minute opener, and the second goal came four minutes before halftime when veteran Portugal defender Carvalho diverted in a vicious Cristiano Ronaldo free-kick for his third La Liga goal since leaving Chelsea in August. Second-half substitute Adebayor thought he had made it 3-0 in time added on, but Ronaldo was ruled to have been offside as he sought to pounce on a blocked shot from another replacement, Mesut Ozil. ""I liked that my team played a serious match. These games ahead of Champions League matches can be complicated because players may focus more on the European competition,"" Mourinho told reporters. ""The team played well and was very focused. We knew Levante would make it tough. They were organized in defense, but we scored early and had things under control. Winning and resting players is what mattered."" The defeat left Levante two points above the bottom three, with the Valencia-based team hoping to avoid an immediate return to the second division. Third-placed Valencia lost ground on Madrid following a 0-0 draw at home to Sporting Gijon, who ended the day above 16th-placed Levante on goal difference. That result means fellow Champions League hopefuls Villarreal can draw level on 48 points with a win at home to bottom club Malaga on Sunday. Fifth-placed Atletico Madrid won 1-0 at Real Zaragoza in Saturday's late match, thanks to Sergio Aguero's second-half winner. The Argentine striker broke the deadlock with a flash of brilliance in the 65th minute as he received Diego Forlan's pass, burst into the penalty box and fired a low shot across the keeper and into the far corner. Zaragoza could have snatched a point, but Nigerian striker Ikechukwu Uche and on-loan Argentine midfielder Nicolas Bertolo both saw late efforts rebound off the Madrid crossbar. Zaragoza remained a point above third-bottom Osasuna, who host sixth-placed Espanyol on Sunday.","Second-placed Real Madrid beat Levante 2-0 to keep Spanish title hopes alive .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Iran's supreme leader praised the uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia Friday and said they echo his country's revolution more than three decades ago, state media reported. ""Today, developments in North Africa, (including) Egypt, Tunisia and some other countries have a special meaning for the Iranian nation,"" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said during a Friday prayer sermon, according to Press TV. ""This is what was always referred to as the Islamic awakening created by the victory of the great revolution of the Iranian nation."" Iran's revolution in 1979 toppled the shah of Iran and ushered in an Islamic republic. But the ferment in North Africa has been fueled by secular concerns. Protests against corruption and poor living conditions in Tunisia forced the ouster of the country's president. Demonstrations in Egypt have called for the departure of President Hosni Mubarak. Khamenei said Tunisia's former President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali had been dependent on the United States and the Central Intelligence Agency. He called the Mubarak regime, which has diplomatic relations with Israel, a ""lackey of the Zionist regime."" He referred to Egyptians' fight for ""dignity and honor"" and said that Mubarak's biggest transgression was to make Egypt an American tool. The Islamic Republic of Iran has been adversaries with Israel and the United States since the Iranian revolution occurred. Khamenei said Iran's enemies have been launching a psychological war against it for the past 32 years, and he said the country's enemies have been trying to undermine the Islamic revolution since the 2009 presidential election. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won a second term in what was regarded by many Iranians as a rigged election.

"(CNN) -- More than 170,000 homes are without power in Queensland after a massive cyclone slammed into the already flood-ravaged northern Australian state, according to the emergency services minister. Some areas could be without power for weeks. Neil Roberts told CNN that said that no serious injuries have been reported since Tropical Cyclone Yasi roared ashore, but emergency crews are still working their way across the affected region. So far, the worst-hit towns seem to be in an area roughly 90 miles (150 kilometers) south of Cairns, he said. Cyclone was 'absolutely terrifying' Queensland Premier Anna Bligh described conditions for local TV networks, and said that many coastal cities are enduring power outages. In Cairns, only 34% of homes had electricity. Townsville, south of Cairns, only has power in about 15% of homes. Farther down the Queensland coast, electricity is out in half of Mackay and Proserpine, and the entire town of Ingham was without power. Bligh said the tens of thousands of power outages were caused by downed lines and a transmission break. Electrical supply lines running into coastal communities have been cut south of the town of Innisfail. ""It is not clear yet why it has been cut and we won't know until we are able to get into the air and check all along that system,"" Bligh said. ""I should say that requires checking 400 kilometers (248 miles) of line and 500 transmission towers."" It could take weeks to repair the problems, Bligh said, an assessment affirmed by Queensland's emergency services minister. Tropical Cyclone Yasi is now a Category 2 storm, significantly diminished but still able to bring strong winds and heavy rain into interior areas of the country, according to CNN meteorologist Jenny Harrison. Yasi is moving toward the west. Wind speeds could reach up to 77 miles per hour (125 kilometers per hour) and very heavy rains could cause localized flooding Thursday and in days to come, she said. Joe Vella, a resident of Cairns, said that wind gusts when Yasi came ashore sounded like a sledgehammer hitting his house -- and that it went on for four hours. ""Our hearts were in our throats thinking what was going to happen,"" he told CNN. Tropical Cyclone Yasi made landfall late on Wednesday night, local time, as powerful Category 5 storm, the highest designation on Australia's classification system. Thousands of people left their homes ahead of the storm, which forecasters warned was one of the worst the country has ever seen. Earlier, Queensland's Premier, Anna Bligh, warned residents they may have to cope alone for several days. ""I can't sugarcoat this for people. It's going to be a tough 24 hours. For some it's going to be a tough couple of days,"" she said at a news conference. ""They need to prepare for the worst-case scenario, and that might mean they have to be self-sufficient for a couple of days. Carl Butcher, another Cairns resident, said before the storm, ""I have all my rations ready to go, batteries, candles. The authorities have been very proactive in informing us about this system. We have known about it for a week. That is more than enough time to prepare for it."" CNN Meteorologist Jennifer Delgado said heavy rain in Queensland could continue until Friday. There are serious concerns for six adults in Port Hinchinbrook, who apparently ignored advice to evacuate the storm surge zone before calling to request help from the emergency services. Police, who are in contact with them via telephone, said the group are currently hunkered down on the second floor of an apartment block, but the tidal surge is expected to reach the top of the first floor. The state's premier, Anna Bligh, had urged residents in the threatened areas to take sensible precautions and to stay inside once the storm hit. ""It will be a display of the awesome power of nature, but it is not something you want to go outside and watch,"" she said. The cyclone threatens more devastation for Queensland, where 20 people died and thousands of homes were wrecked in severe flooding in January, which affected 3.1 million people. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard has announced a one-off tax aimed at helping to for pay the estimated AUS $5.6 billion (US $5.58 billion) in damage caused by that flood. CNN's Pauline Chiou, Hilary Whiteman and Bryony Jones contributed to this report.","NEW: Queensland emergency minister: More than 170,000 homes are without power .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of protesters took to the streets in Providence, Rhode Island, Wednesday to demand that Mayor Angel Taveras take back the termination letters he sent to every educator in the city last week. The protesters carried placards and chanted ""We'll never be defeated,"" in support of the Providence Teachers Union. In a 4-3 decision, the Providence City School Board, voted last week to adopt Taveras' plan to fire 2,000 teachers and staff to give budget writers more flexibility to make cuts. A final decision on how many of them will end up losing their jobs won't be made until the board and the mayor decide specifically how to fill a multimillion-dollar budget gap. The move has outraged veteran teachers and union leaders. Taveras ""has done more to demoralize and disrespect teachers in 30 days than I think anyone could possibly do in the history of teaching,"" union President Steve Smith told CNN affiliate WPRI. Taveras, however, said his mind is made up. ""People will have their voices heard -- however my resolve has not changed,"" Taveras told WPRI. Taveras has insisted that he values the city's ""gifted teachers,"" but felt compelled to give notice to municipal employees of ""potential changes to their employment status"" prior to a March 1 deadline. The mayor cites budgetary problems for the layoffs, not quality of the teachers. The U.S. Department of Education, has twice singled out Providence for its educational reform initiatives, according to Smith.","Hundred of Providence teachers union supporters demonstrate against terminations .

"Rome (CNN) -- Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi called into a television talk show Monday night during an episode discussing claims that he had paid prostitutes for sex, lashing out at the program's host for running a ""television brothel."" The heated exchange with host Gad Lerner on the program, called ""L'Infedele"" (""Unfaithful""), ended with Berlusconi hanging up after a nearly two-minute tirade. ""I'm watching a disgusting show,"" Berlusconi said after being introduced, going on to call the program despicable, foul and repulsive before being interrupted by Lerner. ""Then, you've already insulted us enough,"" the host retorted. After more cross-talk during which Berlusconi appeared to ask Iva Zanicchi, a member of the European Parliament, to get up and leave the show, Lerner again asked Berlusconi to calm down. ""I beg you to moderate the tone of your voice,"" he said. Berlusconi then apparently hangs up. Find out what Italian women think of the scandal . Prosecutors are investigating claims that Berlusconi paid for sex with an underage girl and say three of his associates -- Nicole Minetti, Emilio Fede and Lele Mora -- helped arrange liaisons for him. Milan prosecutors started the investigation in December after Berlusconi called police and urged them to release the girl from jail, where she was being held on charges of theft. The girl, identified as nightclub dancer Karima El Mahrough, was 17 at the time of the alleged activity, from February until May. Both she and Berlusconi have denied they ever had sex. El Mahrough said she did not know Berlusconi well, but that she did receive 7,000 euros (about $9,300) from him the first time they met, on Valentine's Day 2010, because a friend told Berlusconi she needed help. The prime minister has characterized the allegations against him as political mud-slinging. Berlusconi's attorneys have called the investigation ""absurd and groundless"" and a ""grave interference"" in Berlusconi's private life.","Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi lashes out at a TV talk show in call-in .

"Algiers, Algeria (CNN) -- Baton-wielding Algerian security forces clashed Saturday with protesters who defied a ban and took to the streets of the capital demanding political reform. Eleven individuals and eight policemen were injured, two seriously, the official Algerie Presse Service reported. Police arrested nine protesters, the news service said. Algeria's largest opposition party, Rally for Culture and Democracy (RCD), last week called the demonstration to demand the release of detainees, the lifting of a state of emergency that has been in place for almost two decades, and the restoration of individual and collective freedoms. ""We asked to do a march, in a legal way, but they told us: 'You are the opposition and you don't have any rights in your country,'"" said Said Saadi, head of the RCD. Saadi said the government wants Algerians to ""kneel in front of them. But we don't kneel."" The government called the demonstration ""small"" with about 250 people and said it was ""unauthorized."" Security forces prevented journalists from photographing the demonstration or interviewing organizers. Anti-government protests erupted in Algeria in early January after weeks of similar demonstrations in neighboring Tunisia that eventually ended 23 years of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's rule. In Algeria, the protests broke out over spiraling food costs. The opposition blames the government of failing to use the north African nation's energy wealth to better the lives of ordinary people. A law adopted in 2001 indefinitely bans all demonstrations in Algiers, according to the monitoring group Human Rights Watch. A nationwide state of emergency in effect for nearly two decades allows the government to ban any event that is ""likely to disturb public order and tranquility.""","NEW: 11 individuals, 8 police injured, Algeria's official news agency reports .

"(CNN) -- Pakistan were indebted to an inspired bowling performance from their captain to survive a major scare from minnows Canada and maintain their 100 per cent record at the Cricket World Cup. Shahid Afridi took five wickets in a devastating spell as Canada were bowled out for 138 chasing a modest Pakistan total of 184. At 104-4 Canada looked to be on target to match Ireland's stunning win over England on Wednesday before Afridi decimated their middle and lower order, adding a superb run out to his five wickets. Canada lost their final six wickets for just 36 runs as Pakistan surged to the top of Group A with three wins from three matches. But it could have been a very different story had Afridi not rescued his side after they toiled against Canada's bowling attack.. Pakistan lost wickets at regular intervals in their innings with their top three batsman failing to make more than 16. Misbah-ul-Haq and Umar Akmal put together a partnership of 73 before the latter fell for 48 to the bowling of Balaji Rao. Afridi added 20 off 17 balls before he was dismissed by Rizwan Cheema. Harvir Baidwan was the pick of Canada's bowlers, recording figures of 3-35. Balaji Rao, Rizwan Cheema and Jimmy Hansra took two wickets each. Canada were reduced to 16-2 in their reply but recovered to 104-4 with Hansra well set. But Afridi changed the game with a ruthless display of spin bowling. He accounted for Ashish Bagai, Hansra, Cheema, Tyson Gordon and Baidwan before removing Balaji Rao with a direct hit as the batsmen attempted a single. Wahab Riaz polished off the match by bowling Henry Osinde. Earlier, South Africa thrashed the Netherlands by 231 runs as they recorded their second victory in the competition to top Group B.

After a dentist at the Dayton VA Medical Center admitted to not washing his hands or changing gloves between patients during an 18-year period, 375 veterans were tested for hepatitis and HIV. Seven of the 375 have since tested positive for Hepatitis C and two for Hepatitis B, according to Sledge. Test results are not complete. The clinic had said all necessary care and treatment will be provided free to a veteran, should they test positive. Sledge had said the clinic is taking full accountability.

It was centered 45 kilometers (30 miles) west of Dalbandin, and 1,035 kilometers (640 miles) west-southwest of Islamabad, the USGS said on its website. There were no reports of injuries or deaths, Kamal said. The United States, China and Australia had offered aid to Pakistan, but it had not been initially accepted, Kamal said. ""The offer was appreciated but not accepted because its not required yet,"" he said. Arif Mahmood, director of the Pakistan Meteorological Department, put the epicenter at 320 kilometers (about 200 miles) southwest of Quetta near Kharan, Balochistan, and said it had been felt in Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan provinces in Pakistan, as well as parts of Iran and India. Mahmood predicted major aftershocks. ""Earthquakes with such magnitudes in the past have brought on aftershocks,"" he told CNN from Islamabad. An official at Quetta's Civil Hospital said a female cardiac patient suffered a fatal heart attack during the earthquake. He said two residents raced to the hospital but they proved not to have been injured, just scared. Malik Muhammad Iqbal, the police chief of Balochistan province, said he was aware of no injuries. ""Things in the headquarters started shaking and books fell off the desks,"" Balochistan Police Inspector Sultan Mehmood told CNN in a telephone interview. ""We left the headquarters running into the streets -- scared for our lives."" In Karachi, Faraz Leghari, director general police, said he had heard no immediate reports of casualties or building damage. USGS initially reported the quake at 7.4. Quakes of 7.0 to 7.9 are classified as major; anything over 8.0 is classified as great. In Dubai, about 500 miles southwest of the epicenter, a reporter said he felt a moderate shaking that lasted for about 30 seconds. Usman Zahid, a night manager at Serina Hotel in Quetta, Pakistan, felt the quake. He said it was ""frightening"" and estimated that it lasted about 20 seconds. It left ""broken glass in the kitchen"" and made a chandelier swing, but caused no major damage, he said. People with Twitter accounts in New Delhi, Jaipur and Dehradun -- all in India -- felt the quake. People with Twitter accounts in Bahrain said they felt the quake. In Dubai, ""I was just getting ready to go to bed,"" said Leone Lakhani. She said she texted her friends in Abu Dhabi and Bahrain. ""It's not uncommon for this region to have earthquakes,"" said Kurt Frankel of the Georgia Institute of Technology. It is where two tectonic plates come together, he said.

"Frankfurt, Germany (CNN) -- The man suspected of shooting and killing two U.S. Air Force servicemen in Germany was seeking revenge because of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan, according to a warrant issued on Friday for the suspect. The suspect, Arid Uka, is a recently radicalized Muslim who seems to have been influenced by local radical Islamist websites, according to German authorities. Prosecutors say Uka shot and killed two U.S. servicemen and wounded two others in the attack Wednesday on a U.S. military bus at Frankfurt Airport. The arrest warrant for Uka lists two accusations of murder, three allegations of attempted murder and two accusations of causing severe bodily harm. The 21-year-old man said he was motivated to carry out the attack after seeing a video on the internet the day before, which he claimed showed U.S. soldiers raping Muslim women, according to a German intelligence official who viewed a record of the suspect's interrogation. The suspect confessed to the shooting, and said that he acted alone with no helpers, the German intelligence official said Thursday. He was friends on Facebook with several pro-al Qaeda extremists from a group based in Bonn, Germany, that is known to German intelligence officials, according to the official. He also had links to an Islamist preacher named Pierre Vogel and someone named Nessery, who was arrested about two months ago in Afghanistan, according to a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the investigation. The gunman was a postal worker at the airport, but worked outside the secure area. The U.S. official said Uka didn't appear to punch into work Wednesday -- having apparently canvassed the area beforehand, helping him get around the extensive uniformed and plain-clothes security that typically patrol the Frankfurt airport. Another U.S. official on Thursday said that Uka was ""not on the radar screen"" of American authorities prior to the attack. The suspect is from Mitrovica, a town in northern Kosovo, that country's interior minister, Bajram Rexhepi, told CNN. He cited the U.S. Embassy in Pristina as his source. The U.S. official with knowledge of the probe said Uka was a 1-year-old toddler when he moved to Germany, and that authorities believe Uka's relatives had suffered in the 1990s during the Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanians. He has passports from both Germany and Yugoslavia, the latter of which was issued prior to Kosovo's declaration of independence from Serbia in 2008, Rexhepi said. Uka told interrogators that he lived with his family in high-rise public housing in a poor area of Frankfurt, the German intelligence official said. He said he did not have a friendly relationship with people in the neighborhood and did not interact with others there. He said his father was very strict and harsh with him, according to the official. On Wednesday, he allegedly approached a bus, which was parked outside Terminal 2 and was clearly marked as a U.S. military vehicle, German police said after the shooting. According to the warrant, Uka asked a recruit where he was being deployed. The airman replied that he and his comrades were headed to Afghanistan. Uka then shot him in the back of the head with a handgun. The suspect then entered the bus, screamed ""Alahu Akbar,"" and opened fire, killing the driver, the warrant says. Uka then shot two other passengers, wounding one in the head and the other in the chest, the warrant says. The suspect tried to shoot another serviceman but his gun jammed, it says. The suspect fled then fled into the terminal, where he was taken into custody by German federal police, according to the warrant. The suspect used a 9 mm handgun that was illegally purchased, Rhein said. One of the dead airmen was a vehicle operator at Ramstein, and the second was part of a security forces team based in the U.K., an Air Force spokesman said. The bus was occupied by 15 members of a security forces team that was on its way to Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany before deploying to Afghanistan, the spokesman said. Zachary Cuddeback was one of those killed, his grandfather, Daniel Cuddeback, told CNN. It's not clear if he was the vehicle operator or the member of the security forces team. A statement from his family described Cuddeback as a hockey player and ""Army brat"" with especially strong roots in Missouri in Virginia who joined the Air Force in 2009 after a year at Old Dominion University. The U.S. Defense Department on Thursday identified the other victim as Senior Airman Nicholas J. Alden, 25, of Williamston, South Carolina. He had been assigned to the 48th Security Forces Squadron based out of the Lakenheath air base in Great Britain. The two wounded airmen were in a Frankfurt hospital, one in critical condition and the other in serious condition, an Air Force spokesman said. President Barack Obama told reporters Wednesday he was ""saddened and outraged"" by the attack. ""We will spare no effort in learning how this outrageous attack took place,"" he said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said how upset she was by the incident, expressed her condolences to the troops' families and stressed that Germany will ""do everything we can to try and find out quickly what happened."" FBI agents were on the scene shortly after the shooting occurred, said Tom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director and CNN contributor. The FBI's main office in Germany is in the capital Berlin, he said, but it has a sub-office in Frankfurt. The offense is a federal crime both in the United States and in Germany, he said, and could be prosecuted in either location, although that will be determined later. However, the investigation will meet U.S. constitutional standards, he said. Authorities will be investigating the suspect's background and associates, likely subpoenaing telephone and e-mail records, Fuentes said. CNN's Ashley Hayes, Barbara Starr, Aaron Cooper and CNN investigative journalist Paul Cruickshank contributed to this report.","The suspect's motive was revenge against the U.S. military for its Afghanistan operations.

"Djerba, Tunisia (CNN) -- U.S. military planes headed for Cairo took off from Tunisia Saturday, evacuating Egyptians fleeing the Libyan conflict, a deadly war spurring a massive refugee flight. Two Marine planes left the airport in the Tunisian island of Djerba with a total of 132 Egyptians on board, the U.S. State Department said. Two additional Air Force C-130s are en route to Djerba and will take another group of Egyptians home. All four U.S. planes are expected to arrive in Cairo by Saturday night, U.S. officials said. Two Italian military cargo planes landed at the Djerba airport delivering humanitarian aid. There are at least 10 other evacuation flights scheduled for Saturday -- six British, three Spanish and one Italian -- said Firas Kayal, a spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency. Nine of the flights are to evacuate Egyptians and the other is for Malians. There are a few thousand Egyptians left in Tunisia awaiting evacuation after more than 40,000 were taken home. Kayal said there are also three ships preparing to evacuate people. The violence in Libya has generated an exodus out of the North African nation. Almost 200,000 people, a majority of them foreign workers, have fled Libya -- nearly 100,000 to Tunisia and a similar number to Egypt -- according to the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The numbers of people entering Tunisia daily from Libya dropped to 1,800 Thursday and Friday and stood at 3,000 Saturday. Previously, they averaged 10,000 to 15,000 people. Hovig Etyemezian, a field officer for the U.N. refugee agency, attributed the drop in part to fear and the manipulation of the flow of refugees by Libyan authorities. ""A lot of them were scared from leaving because of the fighting so they were staying in their houses,"" he said Saturday. ""We fear the regime might be blocking refugees from the border."" A Sudanese man who crossed into Tunisia said Libyans had been confiscating phones and SIM cards of people fleeing. He said people are afraid to make the journey because of the fighting and the cost for bus or taxi transport to the border has spiked. However, he said, Libyans are not stopping traffic toward border. Raoul Gernali, a Filipino engineer who had been working on a Libyan water project, said Libyan soldiers at the Tunisian border stole his laptop, money and mobile phone. Because of complications with his group's flight home, he and his Filipino colleagues have had to spend three days at the airport. Many countries, such as India and China, put in place well-organized evacuation operations for their citizens. But others, including Egyptians and Bangladeshis, have been left to fend for themselves. The U.S. State Department said Saturday it would donate $3 million to the International Organization for Migration (IOM) as part of a joint U.S.-IOM partnership to help get home thousands of Egyptians and other nationals from Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia. Kayal said more than 10,000 Bangladeshis are awaiting transport in Tunisia. Many Bangladeshis have had to walk to the border because their money was stolen by soldiers and they could not pay for transportation costs. One man suffered a heart attack and died, aid officials confirmed.","NEW: Two planes headed for Cairo take off from Djerba, Tunisia .

"(CNN) -- English Premier League leaders Manchester United crashed to their second defeat in a week as Dirk Kuyt's first-ever Liverpool hat-trick earned them a comfortable 3-1 victory at Anfield. United had lost just once this season prior to last Tuesday's visit to Chelsea, but a 2-1 defeat at Stamford Bridge followed by Sunday's reversal, means they now lead Arsenal by three points at the top -- although the Gunners have a vital game in hand. United were missing their first choice central defensive pairing of Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand, and their absence showed as the home side deservedly took a two-goal half-time lead. Dutchman Kuyt broke the deadlock in the 34th minute after some superb play from Luis Suarez. The Uruguayan striker twisted and turned in the area, skipping around three challenges before getting to the by-line and knocking the ball across the area for Kuyt to apply the simplist of finishes from in front of goal. And, just five minutes later, Liverpool doubled their advantage when United winger Nani inexplicably headed Suarez's cross from the right back towards goal -- and an unmarked Kuyt was on hand to nod home his second from close range. United went close to pulling a goal back in the second half when Dimitar Berbatov's close-range header hit the chest of Raul Meireles on the goal-line. And they were made to pay for that miss when Kuyt completed his hat-trick, again from close range, converting a 65th-minute rebound after goalkeeper Edwin Van der Sar had parried Suarez's free-kick into his path. United pulled one back in the final minute when substitute Javier Hernandez nodded home Ryan Giggs' right-wing cross from close range, but the goal had no impact on the final outcome and Liverpool were able to give a second-half debut to record signing Andy Carroll -- the most expensive English player in history following his $55m deadline day transfer from Newcastle. The result lifts Liverpool back up to sixth place in the table, six points behind fourth-placed Chelsea although they have played two matches more. Meanwhile, United's poor away form, they have won just four matches on their travels, continues to hinder their title chances. The late afternoon game saw struggling Wolverhampton draw 3-3 at home to Tottenham in a thrilling see-saw encounter. The home side took the lead when Kevin Doyle flicked home a close-range header but England striker Jermain Defoe scored two superb goals from outside the area to give Tottenham the lead. Remarkably they were Defoe's first Premier League goals of a season disrupted by injuries. However, Wolves were level before half-time after Doyle added his second from the penalty spot after Alan Hutton had tugged back Nenad Milijas. In an end-to-end match, another fine strike -- this time from Roman Pavlyuchenko -- looked to have given Spurs the three points that would have seen them move above Chelsea into fourth place. But a superb back post header from substitute Steven Fletcher with just three minutes remaining ensured the honors finished even, although a draw helps neither side at opposite ends of the table. Wolves remain second bottom of the table with 29 points, although only nine points separate ninth place Newcastle with bottom team Wigan Athletic. Meanwhile, Tottenham remain fifth, level on points with Chelsea although they have played a game more than their London rivals.","Dirk Kuyt's first-ever Liverpool hat-trick sees his team beat Manchester United 3-1 .

"(CareerBuilder.com) -- Charlie Sheen's latest controversy shows that one of the easiest ways to damage your career or end your job is to say bad things about your boss. Over the past 10 years, he's faced accusations of violence and threats against ex-wife Denise Richards and currently estranged wife Brooke Mueller. And most recently, the dicey details of his alleged drug and alcohol fueled binges have become a fixture in the national media. Watch: Sheen denies hitting women . By and large, his employers have tended to ignore his private life. But even Charlie Sheen can't badmouth his boss and get away with it. On February 24, Sheen called into syndicated radio program ""The Alex Jones Show,"" during which he went on an angry rant about -- among other things -- ""Two and a Half Men"" creator Chuck Lorre. Sheen called Lorre a ""turd"" and a ""clown."" A day after the outburst, production of ""Men,"" which was in the middle of filming its eighth season, was immediately stopped. After all of his antics,  Sheen lost his job apparently for calling his boss names. You don't have to announce your hatred for your manager on a syndicated radio program to get fired. Comments on Facebook, Twitter or even at the water cooler can cost you your job. Here are six examples of why it's never a good idea to bad mouth the boss, and an expert's advice on how you can better handle your frustrations. 1. Gen. Stanley McChrystal was forced to resign from his post as the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan last summer, after his off-color comments about both Vice President Joe Biden and the Obama administration in general were published in an article for Rolling Stone. 2. A British newspaper reported a U.K. woman was fired after posting on her Facebook page, ""OMG I HATE MY JOB!! My boss is a total pervvy (sic) w**ker, always making me do s**t stuff just to p**s me off!! W**ker!"" The women had apparently forgotten that she was friends with her boss on Facebook. A few hours after she posted her rant, her boss replied with a comment of his own, which ended, ""And lastly, you also seem to have forgotten that you have two weeks left on your six-month trial period. Don't bother coming in tomorrow. I'll pop your P45 in the post and you can come in whenever you like to pick up any stuff you've left here. And yes, I'm serious."" 3. In June 2010, Andrew Kurtz, a 24-year old Pittsburgh Pirates' mascot, was fired after posting a comment to his Facebook page about team president Frank Coonelly's decision to extend the contracts of two of the Pirates' managers. Within hours of Kurtz posting the comment -- ""Coonelly extended the contracts of Russell and Huntington through the 2011 season. That means a 19-straight losing streak. Way to go Pirates"" -- Kurtz was fire, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. 4. Four women who worked for the town of Hooksett, New Hampshire, lost their jobs in 2007, after they were caught discussing a rumor that their boss, town administrator David Jodoin, was having an affair with another female employee. Two of the women subsequently made an appeal to get their jobs back, claiming they had been wrongfully fired, but the appeal was denied. 5. In a bit of a twist, Brazilian football team Palmeiras fired its manager after he made a comment on Twitter that he hoped one of his players -- who'd skipped practice with no explanation -- would be traded to a rival team. 6. Dawnmarie Souza, a Connecticut employee of American Medical Response, was fired after badmouthing her boss on her Facebook page. Among other insults, Souza implied that her boss should have been a psychiatric patient. Souza's firing prompted the National Labor Relations Board to file a case against AMR in October 2010, on the grounds that AMR's policy against workers discussing the company negatively on the Internet was in violation of NLRB guidelines. The case was settled in early February, and AMR agreed to amend its policies. The lesson to be learned from all of these outbursts is one of communication, says Kerry Patterson, co-author of the New York Times best-seller ""Crucial Conversations: Tools for Talking When Stakes are High."" CareerBuilder.com: Jobs before they were president . ""Employees typically badmouth their boss when they are angry and don't know how to confront their boss about the issue,"" he says. ""One of the problems with badmouthing is you typically communicate emotions harsher than you actually feel and will most likely regret your words later."" A better approach, Patterson says, is to directly address the issue you're having. ""Regain your composure and choose to problem solve, rather than badmouth. With the right set of skills, you can respectfully confront your boss before you act out in ways that could eventually cost you your job."" The following are Patterson's guidelines for constructive confrontation. • Don't address the matter when you're irritated: ""This is ineffective because at that point our goal is no longer to be constructive, it's to punish. Before opening your mouth, ask yourself, 'What do I really want?'"" • Establish respect: ""Begin by clarifying your respect and your intent. Help your boss understand that your intent is to provide a different viewpoint you feel will help achieve your mutual goal."" • Remain objective: ""Describe your concerns with facts first. Don't lead with your judgments or conclusions. Start by describing in non-judgmental and objective terms the behaviors that are creating problems. If your boss becomes defensive, pause for a moment and check in. Reassure them of your positive intentions and allow them to express any concerns they have."" • Give your boss a turn: ""Finally, having shared your concerns, encourage your boss to share their perspective. Invite dialogue. The result of your openness will be a greater openness on your boss's part as well."" &copy CareerBuilder.com 2010. All rights reserved.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- ""Indescribable"" violence rippled through the Libyan city of Zawiya on Friday, according to a witness who said pro-government forces gunned down peaceful protesters there. The witness said battalions of forces loyal to Moammar Gadhafi attacked protesters with mortars and machine guns as they were demonstrating in the city's Martyrs Square, and they assaulted an ambulance, killing its occupants. ""We buried nine people so far,"" the witness said. ""The attack was indescribable. Direct gunfire was opened on people."" It was unclear who controlled the city. People in Zawiya, west of Tripoli, and ""their public leadership have secured and took control over the city from the armed terrorist elements,"" state TV reported. Libyan government spokesman Majid al- Dursi told CNN that ""Zawiya has been captured, Zawiya has been liberated."" However, the witness said protesters retained some control inside the city, which security forces were surrounding. ""They (Gadhafi's forces) haven't been in control and they never were in control,"" said one rebel fighter, who said his forces lost seven men in fighting in Zawiya on Friday, versus what he said were some 20 casualties among government fighters. Referring to Gadhafi, he said, ""All the man has left is his lies."" By late Friday, the situation was quiet, he said. ""However, we're surrounded by three areas -- the east, the west and the south."" At least 15 people died and 200 others were wounded in the city, according to one doctor, who said there was ""a river of blood"" at the hospital where the wounded were being treated. ""The situation is very bad,"" he said, adding that the facility was short of medical supplies. It was not clear if the casualties at the hospital were wounded during the Martyrs Square confrontation. The doctor said the wounded started arriving at the hospital Friday morning, and most of the wounds were from gunshots. In the capital city of Tripoli, security forces aboard flatbed trucks shot tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds of protesters who had formed after Friday prayers in the Tajura neighborhood, witnesses said. Government officials would not allow CNN into Tajura, whose outskirts were patrolled by a heavy security presence. Security forces were searching cars along the Corniche, a main street in the city. Protesters had said they were hoping to march from the Corniche to the center of the city but were unable to do so. Witnesses said anti-government protesters hid journalists in abandoned buildings and helped move them from location to location so that they could report firsthand in safety. Near Green Square, in the center of the city, anti-government protesters emerged from a mosque to find pro-government supporters outside. Police intervened and fired shots in the air to head off a confrontation, ushering the anti-government protesters back into the mosque for their safety. In the eastern city of Ras Lanuf, meanwhile, forces loyal to Gadhafi fought with opposition members Friday, opposition fighters and commanders said. Thuds could be heard in the distance, indicating heavy fighting around the city itself. ""It's a war,"" said CNN's Ben Wedeman, in Ras Lanuf. ""The protests are now over."" He described seeing truckloads of people ""organizing themselves in a rather haphazard way"" and headed toward the front with no command-and-control structure. ""It's complete chaos, really,"" Wedeman said. Such clashes have spurred throngs of people to flee the country. The number of people trying to leave the country has declined in recent days, however, as heavily armed government forces have intensified their presence at the Tunisian border and on roads leading up to it, the United Nations refugee agency said Friday. ""We are concerned that the presence of the forces and the large drop in evacuees could mean that people are being prevented from leaving,"" said Sybella Wilkes, a spokeswoman for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Roughly 15,000 people had been crossing the border every day, but that number plunged to fewer than 2,000 per day on Thursday and Friday. In all, 200,000 people have fled Libya, according to the International Organization for Migration, which has been working with the U.N. refugee agency on mass evacuations. Meanwhile, a doctor on the northwestern town of Misrata said it was attacked by forces loyal to Gadhafi. The assailants fired at doctors and ambulances, the doctor said. ""We are holding our city, we are trying to protect our city,"" the doctor told CNN Friday morning. ""We are doing our job in the hospital and trying to treat everybody. This morning, they shot at our ambulances. One of them exploded ... they shot at our doctors."" At least 40 people were killed in the city and 300 wounded, the doctor said. While CNN has staff in some cities, the network cannot independently confirm reports for many areas in Libya. CNN has gathered information through telephone interviews with witnesses. Musa Ibrahim, a spokesman for Gadhafi's regime, has denied reports of attacks on peaceful protesters and military installations. In an interview late Friday, Gadhafi's son Saif Gadhafi told CNN that reforms will not begin until ""militias"" in the east have been defeated. He called international efforts to persuade his father to give up power ""a big mistake,"" and said his father remains a popular figure in the country. ""Even if we were to hold tomorrow an election, my father would win with a big majority,"" he said. Gadhafi's aerial attacks have prompted the West to step up discussions about imposing a no-fly zone over the country. U.S. military and diplomatic officials have said enacting a no-fly zone would be complicated and risky, and international support is not strong. ""If it's ordered, we can do it,"" Defense Secretary Robert Gates said earlier this week, but imposing a no-fly zone ""begins with an attack on Libya to destroy the air defenses."" The United States is exploring a ""full range"" of options, Obama said Thursday. Analysts said the Iraq war has prompted nations to be more cautious. ""We went into Iraq with a very dubious understanding of the situation on the ground,"" Christopher Hill, a former U.S. ambassador to Iraq, told CNN. ""So I think there is some concern about whether refugee reports are entirely accurate in a sort of macro sense."" He added, ""I think what the president is trying to do is to try to build diplomatic support and see where we can go with this. And I think it would be highly problematic if he just jumped into something."" The Arab League has rejected international intervention, saying Libya is facing ""an internal affair that is decided by the people and their governments."" But the league cannot ignore the suffering of civilians and would consider the imposition of a no-fly zone in coordination with the African Union if fighting were to continue, said Hisham Yousef, chief of staff of the Arab League. The protests have left more than 1,000 people dead and many more injured, according to the United Nations. Libya's ambassador to the United States has estimated that the death toll was about 2,000. The United Nations has proved to be a sore point for the Libyan government. On Friday, . the United Nations said it was studying Libya's request to install a more loyal diplomat as its ambassador. A letter from Libya's government asked that former Foreign Minister Ali Abdussalam Treki be approved as its envoy. Treki would replace Mohamed Shalgham as ambassador in New York. Shalgham and his deputy, Ibrahim Dabbashi, have denounced Gadhafi and requested that he stop leading Libya. A separate letter from Libya to the United Nations demanded that Shalgham and Dabbashi be denied the right to speak for Libya. In emotional scenes last week, the New York-based ambassadors were hugged by fellow ambassadors after the Libyans criticized Gadhafi and pleaded in the Security Council chamber for international assistance to the country. U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky said the situation ""is complicated"" and that the world body's legal office was looking into the dueling diplomats' situation. The International Criminal Court said Thursday that Gadhafi and some of his sons and advisers are under investigation for alleged crimes against humanity. Venezuela's president has said Gadhafi is receptive to the idea of an international commission coming to the country. The two heads of state spoke this week. ""I consulted with him. I asked him if he was willing to accept a commission of countries,"" Hugo Chavez said on state-run VTV Thursday night. CNN's Nic Robertson, Ben Wedeman,  Jill Dougherty, Catherine E.

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- American citizens who want to leave Egypt on a U.S. government flight should report to the airport as soon as the nightly curfew ends, according to official Twitter messages from the Department of State Bureau of Consular Affairs. Tweets warning Americans to leave began appearing just before 10 p.m. ET, cautioning that further delay was not advisable. More than 1,900 U.S. citizens and their family members have left Egypt since an evacuation operation began Monday, according to a statement from the U.S. State Department. Evacuation flights had been scheduled to run through Thursday.  The State Department said late Wednesday that additional government flights after Thursday are unlikely. Americans who want to leave should should not wait for a call from the U.S. Embassy, according to the Bureau of Consular Affairs' website.  They should go to Cairo International Airport and report to the HAJ Terminal 1, Hall 4 as soon as possible. Chartered planes organized by the U.S began flying out nonemergency American personnel and their relatives on Monday. The State Department also has been providing passage for any U.S. citizen wishing to leave Egypt. The department had said Americans should arrive at Cairo International Airport during non-curfew hours. A media note from the State Department warned U.S. citizens to move carefully in the streets and to avoid demonstrations along the way. The U.S. Embassy had been assisting in the evacuation of citizens with expired passports. Any American with out-of-date paperwork could go directly to the airport, as long as the passport in question had expired within the past 10 years, according to the State Department. Americans with passports that expired more than 10 years ago were advised to go to an embassy to get a replacement. The State Department said Wednesday that the U.S. Embassy in Cairo would remain open during non-curfew hours. Americans flying out of Cairo were part of a wave of foreigners who scrambled to leave Egypt on Wednesday, as the demonstrations that gripped Egypt for more than a week turned violent. British carrier BMI said it has organized an extra flight to help British nationals get back to the UK. The British Foreign Office said it was sending a charter flight to Cairo on Wednesday to fly back British citizens with no other way to get  home. Greece has sent  military aircraft to evacuate 215 Greeks from Egypt, the official Athens News Agency said. Other countries, including China, Canada, India, Thailand and Australia were attempting to get stranded citizens out of Egypt. A plane carrying 212 Chinese citizens  stranded in Egypt arrived in the country Tuesday night, said China's state media. Two hours earlier, a plane carrying 268 Chinese nationals had arrived in Beijing from Egypt, Xinhua news agency said. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard said her government would provide an emergency flight that will depart from Cairo on Wednesday, a statement from her office said. The flights are part of a broadening effort by governments worldwide to transport their citizens out of the country.

"(CNN) -- More than two dozen children were among the hundreds raped by armed rebels in the war-torn eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, the United Nations said. Twenty-seven minors, including one boy, were among the victims, the U.N. said Friday. One attempted rape was also reported. The children were among 240 people raped by Rwandan and Congolese rebels who raided villages in North Kivu province between July 30 and August 3, aid groups said. Attackers blocked roads and prevented villagers from reaching outside communications. Many homes were also looted. Many of the victims were raped by two to six men, according to the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO). MONUSCO, the United Nations peacekeeping force in the country, raised the number of victims after earlier reports put it at 156. Since the rapes were first publicly reported on August 22, more victims have come forward, the force said. The United Nations has said it did not learn about the attacks until August 12, when it was alerted by International Medical Corps. International Medical Corps said it first told the United Nations about the rapes on August 6. A July 30 internal U.N. e-mail that was relayed to relief agencies working in the area warned that the rebels had taken over the villages, and had already committed one instance of rape. The town of Mpofi, 52 kilometers from Walikale, had just fallen into the hands of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, a rebel group. ""A woman was raped there,"" the e-mail said in French. ""Humanitarian workers are said not to go there."" On August 10, the United Nations posted an online bulletin saying that 25 women had been raped in the villages, contradicting statements made by U.N. military spokesman Madnoje Mounoubai and special representative Roger Meece. Asked to explain the discrepancy, deputy U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters this week: ""We are aware of the existence of a number of e-mails and we are trying to trace exactly how those e-mails were responded to."" He said that about 80 peacekeepers were conducting patrols in an area about four times the size of Manhattan. ""The question is -- how much area could they cover, and were they able to get into the areas where they needed to be, where the relevant information was?"" U.N. officials have said they will toughen efforts to stop rapes in the region. ""The recent mass rapes underscores the need for an end to impunity for perpetrators of such crimes,"" said Margot Wallstrom, a U.N. special representative for sexual violence in conflict. These attacks reinforce that ""you cannot have a policy of zero tolerance backed by zero consequences,"" she said.","Twenty-seven minors, including one boy, were among the victims, the U.N. says .

"(CNN)  -- Arsenal were held to a frustrating goalless home draw by Sunderland in the English Premier League Saturday as they missed the chance to close to within a point of leaders Manchester United. Gunners manager Arsene Wenger was left fuming after late decisions went against his title-chasing team at the Emirates. Andrey Arshavin had the ball in the net, but it was ruled out for offside as TV replays showed the opposite. The Russian international was also pulled down by Titus Bramble as he closed on goal, but strong penalty appeals were turned away. ""It's really disappointing and it's very difficult to take a decision like that in a game of this importance,"" Wenger told Sky Sports. ""We have to take it on the chin and continue to fight. But it's absolutely disappointing and unacceptable,"" added Wenger. Arsenal, who were surprisingly beaten in the English League Cup final Sunday, now face a testing trip to Barcelona for their Champions League second leg tie. They will be missing Theo Walcott and Robin van Persie and waiting on the fitness of captain Cesc Fabregas after their 2-1 win in the first leg. Young midfielder Jack Wilshere was also injured in the Sunderland draw and could also miss out on the trip to the Nou Camp. Manchester United, who still lead Arsenal by three points at the top, go to arch-rivals Liverpool Sunday. In the evening kickoff, Manchester City consolidated third spot, seven points behind United, with an unimpressive 1-0 home win over Wigan. David Silva scored the only goal just before halftime as his shot was fumbled by Wigan goalkeeper Ali Al Habsi. Wigan are bottom, four points from safety after only one win since Boxing Day. In other action Saturday, Birmingham came down to earth with a bump after their cup heroics as they were beaten 3-1 at home by fellow strugglers West Bromwich Albion and slip into the bottom three. Bolton came from behind twice and saw visitors Aston Villa miss a penalty before claiming a dramatic 3-2 win. Gary Cahill scored twice for Bolton with substitute Ivan Klasnic grabbing the winner. There was another five-goal thriller at Craven Cottage where Fulham beat Blackburn 3-2 after a late controversial penalty from Bobby Zamora. Everton beat Newcastle 2-1 at St James Park while West Ham's revival continued with a 3-0 win over Stoke, their scoring rounded off by German international Thomas Hitzlsperger, who has been a big influence since returning from long-term injury. The victory lifts the Hammers out of the bottom three in a congested relegation battle.","Arsenal held 0-0 at home by Sunderland in a setback to their EPL title hopes .

"(CNN) -- Utility companies will return Sunday to restore power in parts of Rayne, Louisiana,  after a tornado pummelled the region, killing at least one person. A Louisiana mother who died sheltering her child during the tornado was identified early Sunday as Jalisa Granger, a sheriff's office official said. The 21-year-old's body was found by ""a family member who lived nearby"" who went to check on her, said Maxine Trahan, a spokeswoman for the Acadia Parish Sheriff's Office in Rayne, Louisiana, adding that the ""child was OK."" Granger was killed when a tree fell on her house in the storm. Eleven people were injured, she said. ""There's a lot of damage out there,"" Trahan said. ""Most residents were evacuated, leaving for other relatives' homes. About 20 (who were) evacuated didn't have somewhere to go, but were taken to the local fire department."" Utility companies will be returning to the area Sunday morning to help restore power, she said. The storm that killed Granger was one of at least two twisters tied to a weather system that has caused major damage in the state and wreaked havoc on Mardi Gras festivities. The National Weather Service confirmed that tornadoes hit the city of Rayne, about 80 miles west of Baton Rouge, and the nearby city of Crowley on Saturday morning. Packing winds between 111 and 135 mph, the tornado was 300 yards wide and produced damage over a 5-mile stretch, according to the weather service. The northwest section of Rayne was especially hard hit, with video from CNN affiliate KATC showing several buildings leveled, lots reduced to rubble and large trees knocked down. Petijean said the city's electricity infrastructure was badly damaged, with power going out for all its 10,000 residents soon after the tornado came through. In addition, several houses were knocked off their foundations and there were reports of gas leaks, which led to mandatory evacuations of about 1,500 residents in the city's northwest, Petijean said. The mayor said a curfew was imposed in part of the city, with people asked to stay indoors until 6 a.m. Sunday while authorities check to ensure all is safe. Some of those evacuated are being cared for by the Red Cross. The impact zone is an area about one to two square miles, said Rayne police dispatcher Whitney Thibodaux. Among the buildings affected were a public housing units and Rayne High School, with damage to the computer room, library and gym. Three people, meanwhile, suffered injuries when the twister hit Crowley, according to the National Weather Service. Debris was reported along a 2-mile-long damage path on Interstate 10, and there was damage to a Waffle House, car wash and several residences. About 150 miles to the east, meanwhile, revelers and residents of New Orleans were soaked much of Saturday as steady rains fell on the city. This weekend -- the last one before Ash Wednesday -- is traditionally one of the busiest in The Big Easy, with people partying and enjoying Mardi Gras festivities. The weather forced several changes to the Mardi Gras schedule, including the delay of the Krewe of Endymion parade from Saturday to Sunday, according to a release from the New Orleans Police Department. Other parade-related festivities were pushed up to start earlier Saturday, given the rain-soaked forecast for Saturday afternoon and beyond. The rain stopped later Saturday in New Orleans and the weather service's forecast called for sunny conditions Sunday, with high temperatures in the lower 60s. A flood advisory remains in effect through Monday morning for numerous communities along the Mississippi River, including parts of Chicot and Desha counties in Arkansas; Adams, Bolivar, Isaquena, Washington, Madison and Wilkinson counties in Mississippi; and Claiborne, East Caroll, Jefferson, Tensas and Warren parishes in Louisiana. There were also flood warnings in effect for the Atchafalaya River at Morgan City, Louisiana, through Sunday afternoon; the Tchefuncte River in Covington, Louisiana, through Monday at noon; and the Bogue Falaya River at Camp Covington, Louisiana, through Tuesday morning. CNN's Rick Martin, Craig Bell, Tina Burnside and Jacqui Jeras contributed to this report.","Jalisa Granger, 21, dies when a tree hits her house in Louisiana, the sheriff's office says .

"Sydney, Australia (CNN) -- Rising floodwaters cut off the last ground route into the eastern Australian city of Rockhampton on Monday, as police pegged the number of people affected by prolonged flooding at 200,000. Flooding also put increasing pressure on the southern Queensland cities of St. George and Surat, even as floodwaters receded in the communities farther to the north, including Emerald. Police said ten people have died as a result of flooding since November 30. The latest fatality involved an occupant of a car that tried to cross flooded ground between Muttaburra and Aramac in western Queensland, according to police. Police have not recovered the man's body, but they presume he drowned after the car was swept away by swift waters Sunday. Two other people in the car were rescued unharmed. Police, emergency services and military crews continued working to resupply Rockhampton and other communities with supplies, even after the last road leading into the town succumbed to flooding, acting Assistant Police Commissioner Alistair Dawson said. Although the regional airport is flooded, helicopters ferrying supplies are landing on a dry portion of runway. Resupplying the city of 75,000 is crucial, he said. ""We think that Rockhampton could be isolated probably for anywhere along about a week or so,"" he said. The airport, which closed Sunday, is expected to remain closed for weeks, according to Emergency Management Queensland. The seasonal flooding afflicting Queensland intensified about a week ago after monsoon rains caused rivers to spill their banks and reach record levels. Forecasters said it could be days before conditions improve. Water levels were expected to crest at 9.4 meters (31 feet) in Rockhampton on Wednesday, CNN meteorologist Ivan Cabrera said. In Emerald, north and west of the current flooding threat, waters have begun to recede even though thousands of homes still have floodwater nearby, Dawson said. ""It's a slow journey for these people, and it's a heartbreaking journey,"" Dawson said. Dawson warned residents who have been allowed to return to their homes about placing valuables outside to dry, saying some people could be tempted to take such items. He also warned would-be thieves against such acts, noting additional police have been deployed to affected communities. Dawson also warned people not to drive through flooded communities, saying that could produce waves that could push water into homes that have so far escaped interior damage. Emergency officials said they are working with their counterparts in other Australian states to bring in crews to assist with the flooding and relieve Queensland employees and volunteers fatigued by days of working the floods. Prime Minister Julia Gillard urged residents to stay away from floodwaters. On Friday she toured the devastation and said the flooding in Queensland will cost ""hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars."" Journalists Sarah Wiley and Michael Best contributed to this report.","NEW: Police say 10 people have died in flooding since November 30 .

"Praxedis G. Guerrero, Mexico (CNN) -- Authorities on Friday denied published reports that Marisol Valles Garcia -- the 20-year-old criminology student who made headlines when she became the police chief in the town of Praxedis G. Guerrero, Mexico -- had left the country for the United States and was seeking asylum. Valles Garcia grabbed international attention last year when she took over the top job in a police force whose officers have been abducted and killed. Praxedis Mayor Jose Luis Guerrero told CNN that Valles Garcia is on personal leave because her 8-month-old baby is sick. He said she is expected back at work Monday. ""Marisol, in fact, still works here and she's still getting paid. She comes back on Monday,"" said the mayor. Praxedis is one of the most violent municipalities in the border state of Chihuahua. It is located about 35 miles southeast of Ciudad Juarez, one of the bloodiest cities in world. Andres Morales, town secretary in Praxedis, also said reports that Valles Garcia has fled were false. He told CNN she is on leave taking care of her son, who he said is suffering from bronchitis. He called stories about her seeking asylum ""unfortunate rumors."" Mexico's El Diario newspaper reported early Friday that Valles Garcia had received death threats and fled to the the United States. It cited Jorge Gonzalez Nicolas, the attorney general for the northern district of Chihuahua, as its source for the report. The newspaper said that she was seeking asylum, attributing that to anonymous sources. Meanwhile, the news service Agence France-Presse also reported that Valles Garcia had fled to the United States and was seeking asylum. The agency cited an anonymous relative as the source of its report. A spokesman for the attorney general, Arturo Sandoval, said the El Diario story citing his boss was wrong. ""He did not give a press conference,"" Sandoval told CNN. ""We deny reports that Nicolas said she fled to the United States."" The spokesman said he did not know whether Valles Garcia has left Mexico or not. Still, some questions linger. Guerrero, the mayor in Praxedis, said Valles Garcia is not answering her phone and several of her neighbors told CNN it is an open secret she has fled to the United States. Many said they were afraid to give their names to a reporter, as violence related to drug cartels is rampant in the region. Last year, Valles Garcia was the only person who accepted the top police job. There was good reason for the fear. Around the time she took the post, a 59-year-old local mayor, Rito Grado Serrano, and his 37-year-old son, Rigoberto Grado Villa, were killed in a house in which they were hiding in nearby Ciudad Juarez. Another area mayor was killed in June. Nationwide, the Mexican government says there have been more than 34,600 drug-related deaths since President Felipe Calderon began a crackdown on cartels in December 2006. CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","Marisol Valles Garcia is police chief in a violent Mexican municipality .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan will review blasphemy laws to prevent them from targeting innocent people, a government official said. The government will form a committee of scholars to revisit the law, said Shahbaz Bhatti, the federal minister for minority affairs. It will submit its suggestions and procedures, which will be implemented to stop the law's misuse, the minister said Thursday. ""After the formation of the committee we will .... find the way that whether through the legislation or some other procedural way we can stop the blasphemy law,"" Bhatti said. On pardoning of Asia Bibi, a Christian woman sentenced to death for blasphemy of Islam, Bhatti said the president will wait for the judicial proceedings. Bibi's lawyer has said that the proceedings might take years because the case is still in high court and may later go to the Supreme court. Religious parties are planning protests after Friday prayers. The parties have been upset since the governor of Punjab province helped file a mercy petition with President Asif Ali Zardari's office requesting a pardon for Bibi. Parties including the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazal ur Rehman (JUI-F) party will hold the rallies on Christmas Eve, said Moulana Amjad Khan, party spokesman. A Pakistani court in November found the 45-year-old woman guilty of defiling the name of the Prophet Mohammed during a 2009 argument with Muslim fellow field workers. The offense is punishable by death or life imprisonment, according to Pakistan's penal code. But an investigation by a Pakistani government ministry found the charges stemmed from ""religious and personal enmity"" and recommended Bibi's release. Zardari has said he would pardon Bibi, but a court has ruled that the president can't act until the sentence is confirmed by a higher court -- a process her lawyer says could take two to three years. About 2 million Christians live in Pakistan. The Islamic nation has a population of about 170 million, according to government statistics . as religious parties plan Friday rallies to protest possible changes.","Federal government to form a committee of scholars to revisit the law .

"(CNN) -- Are we alone in the universe? Findings by NASA's Kepler space telescope are making that seem less likely. NASA scientists have announced Kepler has spotted five planets about the size of Earth, orbiting stars in our galaxy. These planets are orbiting in what is known as the habitable zone, which puts them at a distance from their suns where liquid water could exist. Liquid water is a key ingredient for life to form. ""In a generation we have gone from extraterrestrial planets being a mainstay of science fiction, to the present, where Kepler has helped turn science fiction into today's reality,"" said NASA Administrator Charles Bolden. The Kepler science team also announced the telescope found six planets, all larger than Earth, orbiting a single sun-like star. That star is some 2,000 light years from Earth. To date, the telescope has detected more than 1,200 planet candidates. The fact that so many planets have been found in the Milky Way galaxy ""suggests there are countless planets orbiting sun-like stars in our galaxy,"" said William Borucki, Kepler's principal investigator. Kepler does not actually see the planets themselves. The telescope sees tiny decreases in light from the stars as planets transit across their suns. The five Earth-sized planets are orbiting stars cooler and smaller than our sun, and further analysis is still necessary to officially confirm they are planets.","NASA's Kepler space telescope has spotted Earth-sized planets in our galaxy .

"(Health.com) -- Donna Landrigan had been acting strangely for almost a month. Weeks of pounding, wall-to-wall headaches had left the normally calm and confident 35-year-old mother of three feeling confused, anxious, and doubting. ""She couldn't function,"" recalls Dan Landrigan, Donna's husband. ""She couldn't do anything, and she had these really intense levels of paranoia."" Over-the-counter medications did nothing to relieve her headaches, and visits to the doctor and a local emergency room were similarly fruitless. Donna's state of mind continued to deteriorate. The breaking point finally came on a December night in 2008, when she stood in the middle of the kitchen floor and screeched at the top of her lungs. ""It was a bloodcurdling scream,"" Dan recalls. Later that night, Dan found his wife slumped on the concrete floor of the garage, moaning. That chilling evening marked the beginning of a medical odyssey that would ultimately involve four hospitals, experts in three states, and 10 months of guessing, testing, doubting, and hoping. Something was attacking Donna's brain. She'd spend five months in a drug-induced coma before doctors knew what it was. Health.com: Your life-saving guide to bad headaches . Buying time . An ambulance rushed Donna to the ER after she collapsed, but she was quickly transferred to the intensive-care unit (ICU) at nearby Highland Hospital, in Rochester, New York. Neurologist Nick Johnson, M.D., was there when she arrived. ""She was psychotic and required restraints, both physical and emotional,"" Johnson says, referring to tranquilizers. ""She was trying to hurt herself and the people around her."" Johnson was perplexed. After hearing her symptoms, he at first suspected encephalitis, a swelling of the brain usually related to an infection. He tested Donna for more than a hundred viruses and bacteria that can cause the condition, but everything came back negative. In no state to return home, Donna was admitted to the hospital for tests and observation. Two weeks later, Johnson and his team had a breakthrough when an electroencephalogram, or EEG, revealed recurring seizures in Donna's brain that were unaccompanied by physical symptoms -- a serious condition, known as nonconvulsive status epilepticus, that kills 56 percent of the people it affects. But their relief at having finally arrived at a diagnosis was short-lived; the seizures failed to respond as expected to a slew of drugs. Health.com: 20 medical mysteries and miracles . Shortly thereafter, Dan walked into the hospital to visit his wife and found her bed empty. Unbeknownst to him, doctors had used a powerful anesthetic to put Donna in a coma and had transferred her to an ICU on another floor. ""The doctors explained to me that if they continued to let her brain seize like that, it would eventually wear out and start shutting down,"" Dan says. ""They induced the coma. That was the only way they could buy more time to seek and find out what was wrong."" As Dan remembers it, the scene that greeted him when he saw Donna in a coma for the first time was like something out of ""ER"" or ""Grey's Anatomy, ""not real life. ""It was kind of freaky,"" he says. ""You don't expect to see that with a loved one. Everything just comes slamming right at you. It's very overwhelming to walk in and witness it alone."" Health.com: TV doctors bring unethical behavior to prime time . An elusive tumor . By mid-January, Donna's condition hadn't improved, and she was transferred to a larger facility in Rochester. The doctors at Strong Memorial Hospital decided to take a more aggressive approach, deepening her coma with the drug pentobarbital. But after six weeks Donna was even worse. Her blood pressure had plummeted and she had developed hypothermia -- common complications of lying in the ICU for so long. ""I still have the image of walking into the room and seeing despair on the nurses' faces,"" says Dan, who visited Donna on all but four days during the ordeal. ""I got terrified that maybe we were taking a turn for the worse."" In reality, the doctors were getting warmer. They began to speculate that an antibody produced by Donna's own immune system -- a protein that usually fights disease -- was damaging her brain. To confirm their hunch, they sent samples of Donna's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minnesota. The test results provided a glimmer of hope: Pathologists had found an antibody -- they just didn't know what it was. Health.com: 'Indescribable, crazy pain': I survived dengue fever . Experts at the University of Pennsylvania eventually identified the mysterious antibody as a type that targets receptors in the central nervous system that are involved in memory and neuron function. (The antibody can also attack nerve cells in the brain, which would explain Donna's seizures.) These so-called anti-NMDA receptor antibodies usually arise in response to a type of tumor called a teratoma. Teratomas tend to appear in ovaries and testes and can contain cells and tissues of all kinds, even embryonic body parts such as hair and teeth. Once again, the doctors' optimism waned quickly as they struggled to locate the tumor. Meanwhile, chemotherapy had no apparent effect. Even though they couldn't find a tumor, the doctors decided that the only remaining option to save Donna's life was to remove her ovaries and hope for the best. A few days after Donna underwent surgery to remove her ovaries and fallopian tubes, Dan got a call on his cell phone from one of Donna's doctors. ""We found a tumor,"" she told him, sounding choked up. It was indeed a teratoma, a benign but messy jumble of hair cells, nerve tissue, and teeth. The antibodies created by Donna's body to fight the nerve tissue in the teratoma were inadvertently attacking healthy tissue in her brain. With that, Donna became one of about 100 people in the world to be diagnosed with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. In many ways her case is typical. The vast majority of patients who develop this rare condition are women, and most experience psychiatric symptoms, memory problems, and seizures. Ovarian teratomas are the culprit in most cases, but not all. But no one has experienced seizures for as long as Donna did and survived, according to Johnson. A slow recovery . Once the tumor was removed, Donna's doctors started the slow, painstaking process of tapering off the drugs and bringing her out of her five-month coma. On Memorial Day 2009, Donna awoke briefly and smiled when she heard the nurses in her room mention French fries. ""Donna, do you like French fries?"" they asked her. She mouthed the word ""yes."" Donna took about four weeks to become fully alert and conversant. Her first memory upon waking, she says, was hearing that Michael Jackson was dead. (Ironically, Jackson suffered cardiac arrest after overdosing on propofol, the drug that Donna's doctors used to induce her coma.) It was June 2009, and she remembered nothing since October of the previous year. Health.com: Michael Jackson's death: why cardiac arrest is deadlier than heart attack . The seizures have stopped, but Donna, now 36, is still struggling with the aftereffects of the coma. Now, more than a year after waking up, she is at home but in a wheelchair, suffering from nerve damage and muscle spasms. She had hoped that she would be walking by now. ""I like to believe it's temporary,"" she says. Three-quarters of the people who have contracted anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis have recovered fully or with minor neurological problems. Johnson, who took care of Donna for the duration of her illness, is grateful that she seems well on her way to joining that group. ""This was a very unusual outcome, especially for someone with seizures that long,"" he says. Copyright Health Magazine 2010 .","Donna Landrigan spent five months in a drug-induced coma .

"Anchorage, Alaska (CNN) -- Alaska's famed Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race officially gets under way Sunday after a ceremonial start to a 1,000-mile competition that takes mushers through some of the harshest conditions imaginable. Sixty-two teams are competing this year and will travel more than 1,150 miles across the Arctic for a chance at $50,400 and a new truck. They sped through Anchorage Saturday to the sounds of racing paws and cheering crowds. An official ""restart"" of the race is set to take place Sunday in Willow, Alaska, about 70 miles north of Anchorage. The competition will end in Nome.

"(CNN) -- Davis Cup champions Serbia have progressed to the quarterfinals of the men's team tournament after a comfortable 4-1 win over India in Novi Sad. World No. 18 Viktor Troicki sealed victory for the Serbs in front of their partisan home supporters with a 6-4 6-2 7-5 success over India's highest-ranked singles player Somdev Devvarman. And Janko Tipsarevic added the icing on the cake by thrashing Karan Rastogi 6-0 6-1 in the final singles rubber. Serbia led 2-1 going into the deciding day, following Troicki's five-set win over U.S. Open doubles finalist Rohan Bopanna on Friday and Saturday's doubles victory for Ilija Bozoljac and Nenad Zimonjic. India's only triumph came courtesy of world No. 93 Devverman who beat 45th-ranked Tipsarevic in straight sets on day one of their first-round world group tie. Both teams were missing their best players for the tie, with world No. 3 Novak Djokovic -- who led Serbia to victory over France in the 2010 final -- and Indian doubles pairing Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi having opted out. Next up for Serbia will be Sweden, after the Scandanavians built up an unassailable 3-0 lead in the best-of-five match tie over Russia on Saturday. Russians Dmitry Tursunov and Igor Andreev won both Sunday's reverse singles rubbers over Simon Aspelin and Joachim Johansson respectively in Boras, but it was too late for them to progress any further in the event. Philipp Petzschner was the hero for Germany after the world No. 67 defeated big-serving Ivo Karlovic of Croatia 6-4 7-6 7-6 in their tie's deciding rubber in Zagreb. Marin Cilic had delighted the home crowd by defeating Philipp Kohlschreiber 6-2 6-3 7-6 in Sunday's opening rubber, but Petzschner kept his nerve to see Germany through. Germany will now face France, who battled past Austria 3-2 in Vienna as Jeremy Chardy scored the decisive point with a 2-6 7-6 6-3 6-3 win over Martin Fischer. Earlier, world No.10 Jurgen Melzer beat Gilles Simon 7-6 3-6 1-6 6-4 6-0 to level the tie at 2-2 ahead of the deciding rubber. World No. 8 Andy Roddick, playing in the Davis Cup for the first time since 2009, secured the United States their quarterfinal berth with a 3-6 7-6 6-3 6-3 win over Paul Capdeville of Chile to put the Americans 3-1 ahead. John Isner completed the job in Santiago, beating Guillermo Rivera 6-3 6-7 7-5 to give the visitors a 4-1 overall victory. The U.S. team will now face 2008 and 2009 champions Spain in the last eight, after the team lead by world No. 1 Rafael Nadal and comprising of two other top-10 players David Ferrer and Fernando Verdasco, booked their place in the final after racing to a 3-0 lead over Belgium in Charleroi on Saturday. Nadal made it 4-0 with a 6-4 6-2 victory over Olivier Rochus, although the home side claimed a point on the board by winning the final singles rubber. Argentina had already secured their place in the last eight after going 3-0 up against Romania in Buenos Aires on Saturday. The teams shared the reverse singles rubbers to give the home side a 4-1 win and they now play Kazakhstan, who provided the biggest upset of the weekend in their first appearance in the World Group, beating the Czech Republic 3-2 in Ostrava just hours after finding out their hotel rooms had been burgled. Andrey Golubev, ranked 43, shocked Tomas Berdych 7-5 5-7 6-4 6-2 in the day's first reverse singles, before world No.63 Mikhail Kukushkin defeated Jan Hajek 6-4 6-7 7-6 6-0 to seal the decisive point for the visitors. Meanwhile at the WTA Malaysia Open, Australia's Jelena Dokic won her first title on the women's tour since 2002 when she beat world No. 31 Lucie Safarova of the Czech Republic. Former world No. 4 Dokic showed glimpses of the greatness that saw her reach the Australain open quarterfinals in 2009 to defeat her fifth-seeded opponent 2-6 7-6 6-4 in Sunday's final, winning her sixth career singles title in the process.","Reigning Davis Cup champions Serbia progress to the quarterfinals of the competition .

"(CNN) -- One in 50 children is homeless in the United States every year, according to a report released Tuesday. The National Center on Family Homelessness estimates more than 1.5 million children are without a home. The report, by the National Center on Family Homelessness, analyzed data from 2005-06 and found that more than 1.5 million children were without a home. ""These numbers will grow as home foreclosures continue to rise,"" Ellen Bassuk, president of the center, said in a statement. The study ranked states on their performance in four areas: the extent of child homelessness, the risk for it, child well-being and the state's policy and planning efforts. The states that fared the poorest were Texas, Georgia, Arkansas, New Mexico and Louisiana. Connecticut, New Hampshire, Hawaii, Rhode Island and North Dakota performed the best. Homeless children have poor health, emotional problems and low graduation rates, the study found. ""The consequences to our society will play out for decades,"" Bassuk said. ""As we bail out the rest of our nation, it is also time to come to their aid."" The report offers recommendations such as improved support to ensure that children's schooling is not interrupted when they lose their homes, and services to address the trauma of homelessness. Other highlights in the report, ""America's Youngest Outcasts: State Report Card on Child Homelessness:"" • 42 percent of homeless children are younger than 6. • African-American and Native American children are disproportionately represented. • More than 1 in 7 homeless children have moderate to severe health conditions, such as asthma. • Approximately 1.16 million of homeless children today will not graduate from high school.","The National Center on Family Homelessness analyzed data from 2005-06 .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Rapper T.I. begins serving an 11-month sentence in an Arkansas federal prison Monday, while the drug case against his wife is set for a hearing in a Beverly Hills, California courtroom. T.I., whose real name is Clifford Harris, was on his way from Atlanta, Georgia, to the Federal Correctional Center in Forrest City, Arkansas, Monday morning, according to his lawyer's office. It's the same prison where the rapper served seven months last year on a federal weapons conviction. ""Tiny"" Tameka Cottle's name was on Monday's court calendar for arraignment on a drug charge, according to the judge's clerk, but it was unclear if she would travel from Atlanta to California to attend. The couple's latest legal troubles began when a Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputy stopped them on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood two months ago for a traffic violation. They were arrested after suspected illegal drugs were found. The district attorney decided last week not to prosecute Harris, 29, but Cottle, 35, was charged with misdemeanor drug offense. She is accused of possessing MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy, according to the court filing. The rapper's arrest and a failed drug test the next day convinced a federal judge last month to send Harris back to prison for violating his probation on a federal weapons conviction. Harris was given until Monday, November 1, to begin serving his 11-month sentence.","T.I. starts his 11-month prison term Monday .

"(Wired) -- Maybe Apple approved Skyfire, an iPhone web browser that plays Flash videos, to prove a point: Flash is losing relevance. Despite widespread excitement over the first app to work with Adobe's plug-in, it turns out that Skyfire isn't very useful. My hands-on time with the app, which came out Wednesday (and quickly ""sold out,"" according to the developer's press release), was an eye-opening experience. The app's primary function is to take websites that use embedded Flash video and automatically transcode that video into HTML5 so that it's viewable on the iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch. CNNMoney: iPhone Flash app pulled from Apple . To test it, I had to find a popular website loaded with Flash video. The search was difficult. I looked at several video-heavy websites, only to realize they were already HTML5-ready. Examples include The Onion, DailyMotion, ESPN, CollegeHumor and CNET. The biggest video websites -- YouTube and Vimeo -- have moved to HTML5, too. I also found a report showing 54 percent of web video is now HTML5 compatible. (Note that Skyfire only displays Flash video -- not games, animations, ads, etc.) Eventually a Twitter follower pointed me to a website where Skyfire really came in handy: CWTV. When Skyfire detected I was trying to play a Flash video, a play button popped up at the bottom of the browser, and the app did its job: Within 5 seconds I was streaming an episode of ""Smallville."" (Hurray, I guess.) There are some other Flash-dependent websites that work well on Skyfire, like the ""Daily Show"" and ""Colbert Report."" But the browser didn't play all Flash videos. I loaded the TED Talks website, which is a gallery of Flash videos, and Skyfire didn't transcode the videos. I tried playing a Flash video on CNN.com, and Skyfire didn't transcode it, either. But it doesn't matter so much in those cases, because there are already iOS apps for both TED Talks and CNN, which are capable of playing their videos. Another major exception is Hulu, whose videos are encoded in Flash. But it's not Skyfire's fault that you can't view Hulu videos. Because of licensing terms, the company doesn't allow mobile devices to stream Hulu videos for free, as you could with a computer by visiting Hulu.com. Instead, the company wants you to pay a monthly subscription fee through the Hulu iOS app. If you try visiting Hulu.com through Skyfire, you get a message saying it's not supported. Frankly I had a tough time finding reasons to use Skyfire. My hands-on testing of the app made me feel that Flash doesn't matter anymore (not nearly as much as it used to before the iPad hit stores in April). But Skyfire was a hot seller when it launched Wednesday -- so hot that the developers pulled it from the store because of traffic overload, then labeled it ""sold out."" All this leads me to conclude that the underlying reason is the one big chunk of the web that's still not available on the iPhone or iPad: free porn. Indeed, many porn-streaming websites still rely on Flash. That makes me believe that the tipping point for Flash to become irrelevant is when the most-popular porn sites shift to HTML5. My ""research"" tells me that day isn't far away. In the meantime, Skyfire may have only limited utility for most of the web, but it makes a fine porn browser.

"(CNN) -- Guatemalan authorities must act to stop the high numbers of women being killed in their country and ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice, Amnesty International said. The human rights organization Monday urged Guatemala to shore up its fight against impunity and address the more than 685 killings of women reported in 2010 alone. Amnesty International's call comes ahead of International Women's Day on Tuesday. ""Women in Guatemala are dying as a consequence of the state's failure to protect them,"" Sebastian Elgueta, Guatemala researcher at Amnesty International, said in a statement. ""High levels of violence and a lack of political will, along with a track record of impunity, mean authorities are both unable to pursue perpetrators, or just don't care. Perpetrators know they will not be punished."" The Central American country's culture of impunity is a legacy of its 36-year civil war that ended in 1996, the organization said. There were hundreds of thousands human rights violations that were never accounted for, Amnesty said. In a speech last year, Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom said his country has made strides in protecting women. ""Today we have tribunals specialized in femicide, we have offices for attention (to women's rights), we have centers, but once again, this will won't be enough until we finally defeat the social scourge of women's murders, regardless of the reason, justification or other type of cheap excuse,"" Colom said. Passing laws is not enough, Elgueta said. ""The government must initiate effective investigations into killings, improve police training and ensure prosecutions are effective,"" he said. The special tribunals have not been effective, Amnesty said. ""The gender of the woman is often a determining factor in the motive of the crime, the way in which the authorities respond to the case and the way women are killed,"" the organization said. Rosa Franco has been fighting for justice after her 15-year-old daughter, Maria Isabel Franco, was raped and killed in December 2001. But no one has been arrested in the case, Amnesty said. Franco has received death threats and harassment because of her search for justice, the organization said. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights took Maria Isabel Franco's case on the grounds that it was being unjustifiably delayed by authorities. ""If the police had started the investigation early, maybe they would've found Maria Isabel alive,"" Rosa Franco told Amnesty. ""Their attitude, not only in the case of my daughter, but in the cases of thousands of women who have been killed, has been terrible."" On Tuesday, some 60 organizations will march down the principal streets of Guatemala City to commemorate International Women's Day, the state-run AGN news agency reported. The march will start in front of the supreme court. ""With this activity, Guatemalan women will demand the respect and the meeting of their needs and urge plans to solve the problems of poverty, discrimination, lack of opportunities, among others,"" activist Sandra Moran told AGN. Professor Ana Silvia Monzon told the news agency that university students will join the march in memory of Emilia Quan, a young sociologist who was killed in November.","More than 685 killings of women were recorded in Guatemala in 2010 .

"(CNN) -- Add R&B star Usher to the list of entertainers giving up the paychecks they earned performing for members of embattled Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's family. ""I am sincerely troubled to learn about the circumstances surrounding the Nikki Beach St. Bart's event that took place on New Year's Eve 2009, "" Usher said in a statement Monday. ""I will be donating all of my personal proceeds from that event to various human rights organizations."" According to U.S. diplomatic cables posted by WikiLeaks, the Caribbean island was the site for a New Year's Eve party thrown by Mutassim Gadhafi, Libya's national security advisor and one of the dictator's sons. Usher, along with Beyonce, were the entertainment in what the cables called a $1 million personal concert. Beyonce said through a representative last week that she had donated the money she received to earthquake relief in Haiti. The same Gadhafi son on the same island a year earlier paid $1 million to hear Mariah Carey sing on New Year's Eve 2008, the cables said. She sang four songs. In a statement released last week, Carey said she was ""naive and unaware of who I was booked to perform for. I feel horrible and embarrassed to have participated in this mess."" Carey added in her statement that she plans to donate proceeds from a new song, ""Save the Day,"" to human rights organizations. ""Going forward, this is a lesson for all artists to learn from,"" she said. ""We need to be more aware and take more responsibility regardless of who books our shows. Ultimately we as artists are to be held accountable."" Between the cables posted on WikiLeaks and artists' own admissions, no less than five performers have entertained the Gadhafis at a host of international locales. Last week, Canadian pop singer Nelly Furtado acknowledged on her Twitter account that she performed for members of the Gadhafi clan. ""In 2007, I received 1million$ from the Qaddafi clan to perform a 45 min. Show for guests at a hotel in Italy,"" read a tweet on Furtado's official account Monday. ""I am going to donate the $."" In 2006, the Gadhafis brought pop star Lionel Richie to Libya to perform. The concert marked the 20th anniversary of a U.S. raid on the North African country. U.S. President Ronald Reagan ordered the attack after Libya was implicated in the fatal bombing at a West Berlin nightclub that left one American service member dead. CNN reached out to representatives of Richie for comment, but received no response. CNN's Douglas Hyde contributed to this report .","Top entertainers perform for family members of Libyan leader .

"(CNN) -- Chelsea's British record-signing Fernando Torres said on Friday he left Liverpool because the Merseyside club are not yet ready to match his ambitions. The $80 million striker arrived at Liverpool in 2007 but despite scoring 81 goals for the Reds he was unable to fire the team to a major trophy during his three-and-a-half years at Anfield. ""I think they have great ambition and they are doing the right things to get back,"" the 26-year-old said of his former club at a press conference. ""But it will take time. I didn't have that time. When I was an Atletico Madrid fan growing up, I couldn't understand it when a big player left. But with time I could understand they did the best for themselves, their families and their careers."" The Spanish international is expecting a hostile reception from the away fans when he makes his Chelsea bow against his former team at Stamford Bridge on Sunday, but he hopes they will be able to remember what he did for Liverpool. ""I'm not asking them to understand me but I'm sure over time they will see what I did there. I understand they will be angry and will not understand my decision. Maybe in a few days or weeks I will explain all the reasons. ""Football is like this. From one day to the other, people can love you or hate you."" The former Atletico Madrid captain also revealed he would not celebrate if he was to net a debut goal for the English Premier League champions against his former employers. ""First I have to play, and then I have to score but I have big respect for Liverpool fans so I don't think I will."" Torres became the most expensive Spanish player in the sport's history with his transfer-deadline day move to London, but he insists his large price tag will not be a burden. ""I have been in this situation before when I signed for Liverpool. Big money means big expectation. I'm more than ready for the challenge. I'm excited about a new life and new era."" Meanwhile, Rafael Benitez, the man who brought Torres to Liverpool for $32 million in 2007, has revealed the World Cup winner was valued at $122 million when he was in charge of the club. ""I think last year we were talking about $122 million,"" Benitez, who recently left European champions Inter Milan, told the BBC. ""People were talking about maybe you receive an offer from another club. They were talking about $122 million."" Benitez, who left Liverpool by mutual consent in June 2010, said his former charge can recapture his top form for Chelsea. ""He was not playing at the same level the last time, but he is still a very good player. It is big money but could (have been) even better.""","Fernando Torres claims he left Liverpool because the club is still rebuilding .

"(CNN) -- Manny Pacquiao's career will be defined by Floyd Mayweather, even if the Filipino can't give boxing the fight it has long been clamoring to see. That's the view of Sports Illustrated's boxing correspondent, Bryan Armen Graham. He says he is optimistic that Pacquiao and Mayweather can finally reach a deal to settle who is the best pound-for-pound fighter in the sport. Pacquiao's next fight is in May next year while Mayweather is due in court next month to answer charges of domestic violence. Should he retain his liberty, Graham thinks a showdown in December 2011 is a possibility. And according to Graham, the danger for eight-division world champion Pacquiao is that his legacy will be affected just as much by a failure to meet Mayweather in the ring than if the fight goes ahead. He told CNN: ""If Manny gets through his next fight scheduled for May 7 and if Floyd resolves his problems I think there is actually a good chance. I'm as optimistic as I have been in long time for that fight to come off late in the year, maybe December. ""But the truth is there are a lot of theories about Floyd maybe waiting for Pacquiao to be past his prime, like Sugar Ray Leonard did with Marvin Hagler in the eighties. ""Manny Pacquiao, I think he is a once in a generation type talent. I know there are people calling him greatest of all time and you always kind of rush to judge these things when you see someone so spectacular in their prime. ""Its really unprecedented what he is doing but I think we are probably going to have to wait until all is said and done until we really make judgments on his career. ""One thing for sure though is if the Floyd Mayweather fight doesn't happen he [Pacquiao] might be defined just as much for not having that fight."" Pacquiao, who is a congressman in the Philippines, is due to announce who his next opponent will be at his 32nd birthday celebrations on Friday with Shane Mosley, Juan Manuel Marquez and Andre Berto in the frame. Graham explained: ""There is Shane Mosley, the former WBA welterweight champion, Juan Manuel Marquez, the current WBO lightweight champion, and a dark horse candidate is Andre Berto, the former Olympian, who is undefeated but has not really fought anybody of note and has the lightest resume of the three. ""[Mosley] is the best known but at the same time he is also coming off two really bad performances. He lost 11 of 12 rounds against Floyd Mayweather in May and he had a very, very listless controversial draw [with Sergio Mora] in September. ""He is 39-years-old and he probably doesn't deserve a shot against the pound-for-pound champion, but deserves seldom has anything to do with it in boxing."" Pacquiao made history by becoming the first fighter to claim titles in eight weight divisions after his victory over Antonio Margarito secured the vacant WBC super-welterweight belt. According to reports in the Philippines, Pacquiao is currently ironing out a query over his taxes arising from fights in 2009. He recently moved his next fight from April to May due to his political responsibilities in the country.","Floyd Mayweather will define Manny Pacquiao's career even if fight can't be made, says pundit .

"(CNN) -- French international Karim Benzema scored twice for Real Madrid as Jose Mourinho's side defeated Racing Santander 3-1 in the Spanish Primera Liga on Sunday. The away victory lifts Real, who were without top-scorer Cristiano Ronaldo, back to within seven points of leaders Barcelona at the top of the table. Emmanuel Adebayor, who is on-loan from Manchester City, tapped home a simple goal to give the visitors the lead after 23 minutes, although the Togo striker was later to miss a penalty kick . Benzema, 23, scored his first of the match after latching onto a through-ball from playmaker Mesut Ozil in the 28th minute. The home side then missed a penalty of their own before Kennedy Bakirciouglu got one back with 20 minutes remaining. Real made sure of the win five minutes later, when Benzema scored his seventh league goal of the season after good work from Argentina winger Angel di Maria. Elsewhere, Athletico Bilbao moved into fifth position after a 2-0 success over Sevilla at San Mames, a victory which ended a run of four successive defeats. An own-goal from Argentine defender Federico Fazio put the Basque side ahead just after the hour mark, before a penalty from Andoni Iraola wrapped up victory with two minutes left. Bilbao leapfrogged Espanyol, who went down 1-0 away to Levante thanks to a first-half goal from Felipe Caicedo. Sporting Gijon earned another three points in their battle against relegation after a 2-0 triumph over Getafe. The match was over by half time thanks to first-half strikes from Miguel de las Cuevas and Andre Castro.

"(CNN) -- Chelsea have closed the gap on leaders Manchester United at the top of the English Premier League after a John Terry header and a Frank Lampard double gave them a comfortable 3-1 win at Blackpool on Monday. Terry was left unmarked to nod home Lampard's 20th minute corner to put the defending champions on their way to a second victory in a week -- following last Tuesday's 2-1 home success over United. Blackpool were unlucky not to level before half-time when midfielder Jason Puncheon's fierce low drive was tipped onto the post by goalkeeper Petr Cech. But Lampard doubled the advantage just past the hour mark when he converted from the penalty spot after substitute Salomon Kalou was tripped in the area by defender Ian Evatt. And the England midfielder was on hand again four minutes later when he slid the ball home after Kalou's pass had split Blackpool's defence wide open. But Blackpool continued to battle away and they scored a late consolation goal when Puncheon found the corner of the net after being set-up by James Beattie. The result means Chelsea stay in fourth place, nine points behind United although they do have a game in hand. However, Blackpool remain in relegation trouble and they lie in 15th place, just two points and three positions above the relegation zone. Meanwhile, in Spain's Primera Liga, Deportivo La Coruna beat Real Sociedad 2-1 to improve their chance of avoiding relegation. Deportivo's victory means they are up to 13th position, five points clear of the bottom three, while Sociedad are ninth and look clear of relegation danger.","Chelsea consolidate fourth place in Premier League after beating Blackpool 3-1 .

"(CNN) -- Inter Milan are once again five points behind rivals AC Milan at the top of the Italian Serie A table after crushing Genoa 5-2 at the San Siro on Sunday. But the defending champions had to come from behind to claim the three points, Genoa leading 1-0 at the break after Rodrigo Palacio fired home following good work from Abdoulay Konko. However, Inter were a different side in the second-half and three goals in seven minutes completely turned the match around. The home side leveled in the 50th minute when Giampaolo Mazzini slotted home Maicon's cross and they took the lead a minute later when Samuel Eto'o converted a rebound after Goran Pandev's shot was fumbled by goalkeeper Eduardo. And Eto'o added his second goal just six minutes later with a superb individual effort, the Cameroon striker's 18th goal of the season. Goran Pandev made it 4-1 in the 68th minute, after being set-up by Eto'o and Wesley Sneijder, and Yuto Nagatomo netted his first goal for the club to complete the scoring. Mauro Boselli's late header proved little more than a consolation goal for the visitors. Meanwhile, third-placed Napoli lost more ground on the top two after being held to a goalless draw by lowly Brescia at the San Paolo, with coach Walter Mazzarri sent to the stands in the first half for arguing with the referee. The Naples side are now eight points off the top and just two points ahead of fourth placed Lazio, who saw off Palermo 2-0 thanks to an early double from Giuseppe Sculli. Ever-improving Udinese are just a point behind Lazio in fifth place after a 1-0 win over bottom side Bari courtesy of Antonio Di Natale's second-half penalty, his 22nd goal of the season. In other matches, Adrian Mutu scored twice to help Fiorentina to a comfortable 3-0 win over Catania, while an injury time goal from Gaston Ramirez helped Bologna to a 2-2 draw against Cagliari.

"(CNN) -- The first ever regular season NBA game was played in Europe this weekend, as the New Jersey Nets took on the Toronto Raptors at London's O2 Arena. The British capital proved to be lucky for the Nets. The east coast team won both legs of the two-game tie -- they claimed the first 116-103 on Friday and the second 137-136 in triple overtime on Saturday. Despite basketball not enjoying the same high-profile in Great Britain as it does across North America, fans packed the 18,600 capacity venue -- which played host to an exhibition between the L.A. Lakers and the Minnesota Timberwolves a year ago -- to watch the two highly competitive games. In order to make sure anyone new to basketball understood what was going on, an announcer explained who the players, teams and coaches were and gave a commentary to explain the scoring to the crowd. But aside from this, the game followed exactly the same format as any other NBA game would, with the points scored counting towards the Nets and the Raptors standings in the league this season. There was also the same high energy half-time and time-out entertainment taking place on the court, with the two teams' mascots present to entertain the crowds. And just like any big sporting event held in the United States, the event was attended by a host of celebrities. Football stars Didier Drogba and David Luiz of Chelsea were spotted courtside, as were Jack Wilshere, Samir Nasri, Gael Clichy and Cesc Fabregas from English Premier League rivals Arsenal. Part of the reason for the games being played in London was to promote basketball in Britain ahead of the 2012 Olympics -- to ensure the sport attracts the same large crowds as it did at the previous Games in Beijing. However, as part of the NBA's aim to expand across the globe, this might not be the last time we see games in the lucrative franchise decided on foreign soil. NBA commissioner David Stern has hinted that more games could be held in London and elsewhere in Europe and Asia -- where demonstrations have also been held previously. He even said that there could be European based teams playing in the NBA in the future. It certainly does not seem like the players would mind traveling to London again. Raptors and Italy star Andrea Bargnani said: ""The crowd was unbelievable. It's great the Olympics are going to be here."" The Nets' Brooke Lopez added: ""It was fantastic for the city of London to experience it and see two really fantastic NBA games.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Transportation Security Administration on Friday ordered re-testing of all radiation-emitting full-body scanners after an internal review showed calculation errors, missing data and other discrepancies on paperwork by contractors who routinely check the machines' radiation levels. As recently as Wednesday, the agency vouched for the safety of the machines, with Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano telling a Senate committee that independent studies concluded the machines are ""more then safe."" ""The amount of radiation is approximately (the same as that received) as two minutes in the air,"" Napolitano said. The TSA reiterated that position Friday, characterizing problems as ""record-keeping errors."" But Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said the TSA found problems with more than one-quarter of the reports it reviewed, ""including gross errors about radiation emissions."" ""That is completely unacceptable when it comes to monitoring radiation,"" Collins said. ""If TSA contractors reporting on the radiation levels have done such a poor job, how can airline passengers and crew have confidence in the data used by the TSA to reassure the public?"" The TSA said all ""backscatter"" full body scanners will be re-tested by the end of March, the TSA said. It will also require contractors to re-train machine testers, while increasing TSA oversight over the tests. Further, the TSA said it would ask the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to update its 2008 report. The announcements came as the TSA, responding to public pressure, posted raw data about radiation tests on its website. The agency also promised to post all future radiation checks on the web site for public review. The TSA said its internal review looked at randomly selected reports generated over the last two years at 15 airports. The tests are conducted by manufacturers and contractors. ""These reports confirm that each piece of technology reviewed meets all national safety standards,"" the TSA said.  But, the TSA said, the reports contained ""inaccuracies."" Those inaccuracies included ""calculation errors not impacting safety,"" no reading of background radiation levels, and missing ""non-measurement related information."" TSA spokesman Nicholas Kimball said Friday that numerous independent tests have confirmed that body scanners are safe, ""but these record-keeping errors are not acceptable."" ""We're taking a number of steps to ensure the mistakes aren't repeated and the public will be able to see for themselves by reviewing all future reports online,"" Kimball said.

"United Nations (CNN) -- Thirty Congolese women on the border of Angola and Congo were held in a dungeonlike prison and systematically raped by uniformed men, according to U.N. officials. The Congolese women were part of a group of 150 people who had recently been expelled from Angola. The United Nations said the women reported they were held for nearly two weeks in early October and raped. The U.N. said three people in the group were killed, including two men and a woman, who died after being repeatedly raped. Those who survived and were released then returned to the Congo in the nude and with no belongings, according to the United Nations. The rapes were first reported to the United Nations on Saturday. In another region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Western Kasai, at least 20 Congolese women also reported being raped, the United Nations said. The U.N. Office for Humanitarian Affairs said 1,200 expulsions have been reported from Angola. While these expulsions are legal, OCHA spokesman Maurizio Giuliano said they are concerned about the human rights violations of the deportees. The organization encouraged expulsions to happen in a timely fashion with respect for human rights. U.N. officials were scheduled to meet Wednesday in the region to discuss the possibility of sending a team to investigate these claims further. These reported rapes come after nearly 500 people were systematically raped during rebel attacks this summer in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.","Thirty Congolese women raped on Angola-Congo border by uniformed men, U.N. officials say .

"(CNN) -- Costa Rica and Nicaragua both must refrain from sending or maintaining civilians, security forces or police in a disputed border area, the International Court of Justice ordered Tuesday, offering each side something it could claim as a victory. Tensions between the two countries have flared over Calero Island, a parcel of land on the Atlantic coast, since last year. In November, Costa Rica's foreign ministry said the country had filed a lawsuit in the court to end a situation that ""threatens imminent and irreparable harm"" to Costa Rica. The suit asked the court to stop ""the construction of a canal on Costa Rican soil,"" the ministry said then. Nicaragua has claimed it has never entered Costa Rican territory and has only worked on its land. The court's order was a provisional measure while the case is before the judges. It may be several years before a final ruling is made. The barring of any persons from the disputed area was a unanimous decision. The court did not order Nicaragua to refrain from dredging. By a 13-4 vote, the justices said that Costa Rica could send personnel to the area to protect the environment, but only in a manner that won't escalate tensions. The judges also ordered Nicaragua and Costa Rica to ""refrain from any action which might aggravate or extend the dispute before the court or make it more difficult to resolve."" Finally, all the judges agreed that both countries will inform the court of their compliance with the order. The International Court of Justice is the United Nation's high court, based in The Hague. Costa Rican President Laura Chinchilla praised the court's ruling, calling the decision ""just."" ""First, because it sends a clear message that borders cannot be redefined in a unilateral manner, or through force, and second, because it creates the conditions ... that allow for two friendly nations to return to dialogue,"" she told CNN en Espanol.","NEW: The court allows Nicaragua to continue dredging .

"(CNN) -- Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger and midfielder Samir Nasri have both been charged with improper conduct by governing body UEFA following the London club's European Champions League elimination at the hands of Barcelona on Tuesday. The French duo are alleged to have made comments to Swiss referee Massimo Busacca after Barcelona's 3-1 second leg win at the Camp Nou on Tuesday. ""UEFA has opened disciplinary proceedings against Arsenal FC coach Arsene Wenger and the English club's midfielder Samir Nasri,"" read a UEFA statement. ""Both are to face charges of improper conduct, and their cases will be heard by the UEFA Control and Disciplinary Body on Thursday March 17."" Was Wenger right - did the referee kill the game? The Gunners were angered by Busacca's decision to issue Dutchman Robin van Persie with a second yellow card in the 56th minute for kicking the ball away following an offside decision, although the striker claimed to have not heard the referee's whistle. At that point the match was level at 1-1 after Lionel Messi had given Barca the lead on the stroke of half time, only for makeshift defender Sergio Busquets to head the ball into his own net in the second half. Messi returns to haunt Arsenal . Once the visitors were reduced to 10 men Barcelona took control and a Xavi strike coupled with a Messi penalty helped the Catalans to a comfortable success. Wenger, 61, and Nasri, 23, are both alleged to have made comments to Busacca in the tunnel at the end of Tuesday's match.","Arsene Wenger and Samir Nasri have both been charged with improper conduct by UEFA .

"(CNN) -- A quick-hitting Northeast snowstorm that began coating the nation's capital Wednesday has forced the cancellation of hundreds of flights for travelers in New England and the Eastern Seaboard, according to airline spokesmen. Winter storm warnings were in effect Wednesday from the southern Appalachian mountains to coastal Massachusetts and were expected to expire Thursday morning, said CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. Snow was falling about an inch an hour in Washington, D.C., which was expected to receive 4 to 6 inches Wednesday evening, he said. Federal employees and most schools in Washington ended business early on Wednesday. New York is expected to receive 8 to 12 inches of snow starting about midnight, Morris said. Boston should also see 8 to 12 inches, with the heaviest snow falling Thursday morning, he said. Nashville and central Tennessee got 2 to 4 inches of snow Wednesday, Morris said. The snowfall was even prompting airlines to pre-emptively cancel flights. Among the biggest cancellations were Delta Airlines' 575 flights between Washington, D.C., and Boston, said spokesman Anthony Black. American Airlines/American Eagle spokesman Ed Martelle said the two airlines cancelled 280 flights for Wednesday and 65 more are cancelled for Thursday between Washington, D.C., and Boston. United cancelled 276 flights Wednesday and proactively cancelled 71 more for Thursday, and Continental cancelled 322 flights Wednesday and 108 more for Thursday, said Christen David, spokesman for both airlines. Southwest Airlines canceled more than 100 flights Wednesday in the Northeast, said spokeswoman Brandy King. Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley wants people to stay off the roads. ""This is a serious traffic hazard and challenge,"" O'Malley said at a press briefing from the state's operation center in Hanover. Maryland officials said 1,600 maintenance workers and 1,400 pieces of equipment would be on the roads all night battling the storm. The National Weather Service has issued a winter storm warning for the area until early Thursday morning. Snow accumulations could reach 10 inches. One problem that could hamper snow removal is the lack of sand and chemical preparation for roadways, due to the recent heavy rains. ""We have not been able to successfully pretreat the surfaces,"" O'Malley told reporters after a briefing with Maryland public safety and transportation officials. Maryland has not activated the National Guard, but they are ready for deployment if needed, officials said. In Florida, the National Weather Service has dispatched survey teams to investigate damage caused by storms that moved across the state Tuesday evening. They found that a tornado near Boca Raton had snapped and uprooted trees, CNN meteorologist Morris said. In St. Petersburg, Florida, 90 mph straight-line winds damaged a gas station and injured one person, Morris said. A tornado near Alva, Florida, destroyed and damaged six mobile homes, and straight-line winds between 60 and 90 mph damaged several homes near Groveland, Florida, Morris said. This snowstorm comes after many had just dug themselves out of a blizzard that walloped the Northeast earlier this month. The storm that hit in early January closed hundreds of schools, stopped the rail system between New York City and points north for days and grounded hundreds of flights. Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Vermont reached up to 30 inches, while most areas got 8 to 16 inches of snow.

"(CNN) -- A vast winter storm on Tuesday blasted much of the nation with nearly horizontal blowing snow, cloaking trees and power lines with ice up to an inch thick, forcing airports to close and complicating the travel plans of fans headed to this weekend's Super Bowl in Texas. A mix of blizzard, ice, hard freeze and high wind warnings sprang up across most of the Lower 48 states as the system pressed eastward, from New Mexico to Maine. Forecasters said as many as 100 million people in the United States would feel its effects. Blizzard warnings were up late Tuesday in eight states -- from eastern Kansas to western Ohio. The mass of frigid precipitation, in its relentless northeasterly march, formed an arc that was centered in the Great Lakes region and stretched from northeastern Kansas in the west to the edge of Chesapeake Bay in the east. The stem of the storm brought needed rain to much of the Southeast, but unwelcome ice and hard freeze warnings in other places, as far south as Corpus Christi, Texas. Parts of the Florida Panhandle, southwestern Georgia and southeastern Alabama were under a tornado watch. High-wind warnings were posted in eastern Tennessee and western Virginia, with gusts of 55 mph forecast in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. The National Weather Service forecasts and advisories through Wednesday night read like the Abominable Snow Monster's Christmas list: Up to 14 inches of snow in South Bend, Indiana, with winds up to 30 mph; Up 13 inches of snow and a low of 12 below zero in Ottumwa, Iowa; as much as 13 inches of new snow in Berlin, New Hampshire, by Wednesday night; hard freeze warnings in Houston and Galveston, Texas. In Chicago, part of a fiberboard roof panel behind home plate at Wrigley Field, home of the baseball Cubs, broke away in the high wind, the ball club said. Police roped off nearby streets and sidewalks as a precaution, the club said. Drifting and blowing snow closed parts of interstate highways in Oklahoma and Missouri, while police in St. Louis stopped patrolling in advance of the worst of a storm that was expected to leave as much as 30 inches of snow in parts of Missouri and Illinois, and up to an inch of ice in places. ""Do not travel! Stay inside!"" the National Weather Service warned. ""Strong winds and blinding snow will make travel nearly impossible. This is a life-threatening storm."" Ice is the larger threat in a band that extended from south of St. Louis to western Connecticut and parts of New Jersey. In those regions, more than an inch of ice could accumulate, downing trees and power lines. All of western Maryland was under a freezing rain advisory. An ice storm warning covered 29 counties in central and southern Indiana. In the city of Greenwood, a command center was set up to deal with downed trees and other hazards that might impede first responders during emergencies. By Tuesday evening, a quarter-inch of ice had accumulated on trees in the area, with at least a half-inch expected, Fire Chief James Sipes told CNN affiliate WAVE of Louisville, Kentucky. ""The last time we had an event of this nature was in 1988,"" Sipes said, ""and it caused substantial damage."" The nasty weather is even threatening festivities surrounding the Super Bowl, set for Sunday in Dallas. Icy conditions forced Dallas-Fort Worth Airport to temporarily close Tuesday morning. The airport reopened after a two-hour closure with one runway in operation, airport officials told CNN. Nearby Love Field was also forced to close and was expected to reopen by 2 p.m. (3 p.m. ET). ""We had thunderstorms, we had rain, we had freezing rain, ice pellets, sleet -- the only thing we didn't have was hail and sunshine,"" said Ed Martelle, the spokesman for AMR Corp., which owns American Airlines. In Illinois, all major thoroughfares from I-70 and further north were covered with -- or had patches of -- ice and snow, according to the state Department of Transportation. In Missouri, whiteout conditions forced the closure of I-70 through the middle part of the state. ""This is not a good time to be on the road,"" Missouri highway department official Don Hillis said. ""Almost all of the state is covered with snow and some areas are receiving ice, making some roads impassable."" The Oklahoma Department of Public Safety reported that westbound Interstate 40 in Seminole and Okfuskee counties was closed Tuesday afternoon with 4-foot snow drifts. The department said some arterial roads and all secondary routes in parts of eastern Oklahoma were nearly impassable. The Will Rogers Turnpike, I-44 in northeast Oklahoma, also was closed, and the National Guard was rescuing people trapped in their cars, the department said. Tow trucks were running as much three hours behind in some parts of the state, it said. In Tulsa, even police cars and ambulances got stuck in the snow. The snowfall also collapsed part of a roof at the Hard Rock Casino Tulsa, according to Amanda Clinton, a spokeswoman for the Cherokee Nation, which owns the casino. No one was injured. Those who ventured out did so against the advice of government and emergency officials, who urged people to stay off the roads and inside, and prepare for the worst. Up to 16 inches of snow are expected in parts of Michigan, with winds up to 40 mph causing significant drifts, according to CNN affiliate WILX in Lansing. Winds were gusting at 33 mph at Detroit City Airport Tuesday night, with the temperature at 17 degrees. Michigan's emergency management department has posted an advisory for residents to ""have essential supplies ready to stay safe at home, at work and in their vehicles."" As the storm approached, governments vowed they would be ready for what was being described as a storm of historic proportions. Missouri, Illinois, Oklahoma and Kansas declared states of emergency so they could bring extra resources to bear. Missouri mobilized 600 National Guard troops to help cope with the storm. Illinois put 500 troops on notice that they might be needed as the storm intensifies. Iowa also activated some guard members. Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe also declared a state of emergency and activated National Guard troops to help move supplies to the northwestern portion of the state, where power outages are expected as snow, ice and high winds move in. Warming centers set up by the Salvation Army were running and busy in Fayetteville and Bentonville, according to CNN affiliate KFTA. ""We are known for wild weather swings in Arkansas, but to have snow, ice and severe thunderstorms in the same day is rare,"" Beebe said. In Chicago, where snowfall of 15 inches or more happens but once every two decades, according to the National Weather Service, officials outfitted 120 garbage trucks with plows to supplement the city's usual fleet of 274 trucks, said Jose A. Santiago, executive director of the city's Office of Emergency Management. The White House press office issued a statement saying President Barack Obama had told the Federal Emergency Management Agency to be prepared to help state and local governments with widespread power outages and other issues arising from the storm. Thousands of flights were canceled Tuesday. Airports in Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Oklahoma, were effectively closed. United, Continental and American Airlines announced that flights were suspended after 5 p.m. (6 p.m. ET) out of Chicago O'Hare International Airport and that flights scheduled for Wednesday also have been suspended. Delta Air Lines said more than 1,350 flights, most of them to or from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, were canceled on Tuesday, and 800 Wednesday flights had also been canceled. JetBlue scrubbed 371 Tuesday flights and 794 total. US Airways canceled 687 flights. Plummeting temperatures were expected to filter in behind the system, dropping to below zero in the upper Plains states over the next few days. Parts of the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma also will experience some of the coldest air this season, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said.","NEW: Frigid precipitation stretches from Plains to Eastern Seaboard .

"(Rolling Stone)  -- A quick glance at Billboard's Dance/Club Play Songs chart shows many unsurprising names: Britney Spears, Rihanna, Taio Cruz, Kylie Minogue and Florence + The Machine. Up above all of them, at the No. 1 spot, is Yoko Ono with a dance remix of her super obscure 1972 album track ""Move On Fast."" It's her sixth consecutive No. 1 dance hit.

Producers have been remixing tracks from Ono's deep catalog of avant-garde music for the past decade. ""At first I was prejudiced against the idea,"" she says. ""I had the pride of a rocker. People can get very elitist very quickly, and that's how I was."" When she was first approached about remixing ""Walking On Thin Ice"" she was especially resistant because that was the song John Lennon was working on when he died. ""I was like, 'No, never! Don't change anything!'"" she says. ""It was a very sensitive subject for me."" Rolling Stone: Yoko Ono's Plastic Ono Band concert with Lady Gaga, Iggy Pop and more . About 10 years ago she relented and allowed a variety of artists -- from Pet Shop Boys to Basement Jaxx to Felix Da Housecat -- to create dance remixes of her work for the albums Open Your Box and Yes, I'm A Witch. ""When I first heard the songs I cried they was so beautiful,"" she says. ""I was so dumb to be against it. Musically, it was as very, very rich experience for me to hear it."" The album was a critical and commercial success, leading to the release of Move On Fast (The Remixes), which hits shelves on March 12th. The set features remixes of her catalog by Richard Morel, Digital Dog, Wawa, Chris The Greek and many more. ""I never thought I would go into the dance charts,"" says Yoko. ""I respect these producers so much now. I think one day the dance field is going to be very important musically. I mean, it's a high art now...I just feel great that people are dancing. I great and I feel it."" Ono rarely steps foot into a dance club, even though many of them now regularly play her music. ""I did go to a few clubs just so people can be like, 'Yes, Yoko was there!"" she says. ""But it does get a bit nerve wracking to go to those places.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for a suicide attack on a funeral procession that killed at least 37 people in northwest Pakistan. More than 50 others were wounded when the bomber detonated explosives during a funeral on the outskirts of Peshawar, said police official Kalam Khan. He said a hand grenade was found at the site after explosion. Security forces promptly defused it. The attack occurred at the funeral of the wife of a member of a pro-government militia group, said Muhammad Ejaz Khan, a senior city police official. A few hours after the blast, a spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban said his group was behind the blast.

"(CNN) -- Emblazoned on a long, tall, concrete barrier in the midst of a rocky Middle Eastern landscape is this spray-painted message: ""Mirror, mirror on the wall. When will this senseless object fall?"" Messages of peace, marriage proposals and jokes are among the most popular graffiti requests. It's one of more than 900 graffiti messages that have been spray-painted by Palestinians on the controversial wall that separates Israel and the West Bank. The painters take orders through a Web site that lets customers get a message on the wall. For the equivalent of $40, a Palestinian will spray paint the message and send three digital photos of it. Anything goes -- marriage proposals, jokes, notes to friends -- as long as it isn't extremist, hate-filled, or pornographic, said Faris Arouri, one of the founders of the site. ""Trying to imagine a clear view between Palestine and Israel,"" one message reads. ""If all humans are equal, why do they have to live separated?"" says another. And another simply shouts: ""Get along with each other!"" ""This is an alternative way to send your message to whoever you're sending it to,"" Arouri told CNN from Ramallah. ""It is there physically and it will stay there until someone sprays over it or someone decides to demolish that wall ... Hopefully it won't stay forever, because hopefully this wall will be removed sometime soon."" The Israeli government began building the barrier in 2002, about two years after renewed violence erupted in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza. In some areas, it takes the form of a tall concrete wall; in others, it is more of a fence. Israel says the barrier has been successful in preventing terrorist attacks by Palestinians. But Palestinians say it amounts to an illegal land grab of Palestinian territory because it does not match the line of Israel's border with the West Bank before the 1967 Six Day War. The barrier cuts so far into West Bank territory at some points that the West Bank settlement of Alfei Menashe and five Palestinian villages are actually now on the Israeli side of the wall. Palestinians in those villages contend they are cut off from both Israel and the West Bank because they are not allowed to travel into Israel and they must pass through military checkpoints to reach other West Bank villages. The Sendamessage Web site says other families cut off by the barrier are deprived of their livelihoods. The site describes how the wall separated a family from the hotel they owned and kept farmers away from their 500 olive trees. Israel's supreme court has twice ruled that the government must reroute sections of the barrier to avoid infringing on the lives of thousands of Palestinians. Arouri represents a Palestinian non-profit group, the Peace and Freedom Youth Forum, that works on the social and political issues facing young people in the West Bank. About two-thirds of the money raised through the site goes to the group, which uses it to pay for projects like building a playground, buying bicycles, or establishing laundry facilities for university students in Bir Zeit, near Ramallah. The group says it only works with organizations that are legal in the Palestinian territories and allowed to operate by the Israeli government. The rest of the money goes to the group's partners in the Netherlands, who maintain the Web site, accept payments, and manage the paperwork. First conceived at a Dutch-Palestinian workshop in Ramallah two years ago, the site has gone on to attract customers from around the world. There have been 910 orders so far, said Justus van Oel, a Dutch screenwriter who volunteers his time maintaining the site in the Netherlands. Spray-painting on the wall is a peaceful way for Palestinians to protest the barrier, Arouri said. ""You're not only defying the existence of the wall, but you're also showing the international community our refusal, first of all, to such a structure,"" he said. ""Also, it's an attempt to humanize the Palestinian society in the eyes of the world, showing that the Palestinians are not just militants who are violently resisting occupation."" There are other benefits to the project, too, Arouri said. The rest of the world can get a glimpse, however small, into the Palestinians' lives behind the wall -- and the Palestinians get a sense that they're not forgotten, Arouri said. ""There's no big concept,"" van Oel told CNN. ""The wall won't fall because texts are on it, but the people behind the wall, they will have a face. It's also about beauty and poetry. It inspires people."" Poetry is indeed on the wall, as are emotional pleas to take the wall down. Marriage proposals are a frequent order, Arouri said, but so are jokes and funny messages. ""We had a series of obviously French (people) making silly jokes about each other, because the names were just being repeated and repeated,"" he said. ""We also got a message supposedly from a dog, asking the neighbor's dog to come out and play in the sun."" The diversity of the messages is something Arouri says he finds incredible. ""We've covered most of the aspects of human life,"" he said. Caspar Nieuwenhuis, a Dutch theater director, used the site to propose to his girlfriend. His plan was to feature a picture of the spray-painted proposal on a Dutch news broadcast about the wall and make sure his girlfriend, a journalist, was watching -- but the picture never aired. ""Then I thought, well, I have this photo of a Palestinian boy who's writing my proposal on the wall,"" Nieuwenhuis wrote to CNN. ""I've got a notebook (computer). I could save the photo (onto) my desktop and show it to my girlfriend, just that plain and simple. ""So I did. And when she saw this, she said 'yes' and cried,"" he said. Nieuwenhuis said he heard about the site through van Oel, a friend, and liked the idea right away. ""I thought it was a brilliant idea to have something beautiful written on an ugly wall,"" he told CNN. The Sendamessage Foundation is also planning to spray-paint an entire letter written by South African human rights activist Farid Esack next month. It's looking for customers to sponsor a portion of the letter in exchange for having their name signed onto the end. In the letter, Esack compares the situation in the Palestinian territories to South Africa under apartheid, the Web site says.","Web site takes orders for graffiti messages to be sprayed on Israeli barrier .

"Washington (CNN) -- The current large-scale U.S.-South Korean naval exercise off the west coast of Korea has multiple purposes. After last week's North Korean attack on a South Korean island, the most important is to send a message to Pyongyang that Washington and Seoul have the capability -- and the will -- to respond with devastating force to any further acts of aggression. A second is to strengthen the U.S.-ROK (Republic of Korea) joint capability to coordinate such a response, as well as to reinforce their anti-submarine capabilities that were so obviously inadequate last March, when North Korea torpedoed a South Korean naval vessel on the high seas. In light of the fact that past North Korean misbehavior has not produced serious consequences for Pyongyang, it may be difficult to convince the North that ""this time we're serious."" There was a South Korean artillery response to the shelling last week, but it was apparently flawed in execution and did not produce much damage. What is needed is to credibly promise a harsh response to future attacks, yet not trigger North Korean escalation or a preemptive war on the assumption that an effort to destroy the North is looming. Despite its labeling the current situation an ""ultra-emergency wartime situation,"" the North Korean regime is not suicidal, and one ought not assume it will take actions that will predictably bring destruction down on its head. But its apparent and dangerous belief that it can act with impunity has been reinforced over many years. It comes not only from the measured South Korean response after the ship sinking, and from the absence of truly punishing actions after it reneged on commitments not to test intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons. Even assassination attempts against South Korean presidents and the blowing up of a civilian Korean airliner in years past produced little by way of lasting consequences for the North. Fear of precipitating a second Korean War has proved an effective deterrent against strong U.S.-ROK retaliation. This time, Washington and Seoul seem determined not only to demonstrate the resolve to strike back (albeit proportionately) if necessary, but to strengthen existing UN-sponsored sanctions against the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) that will effectively curtail the North's illicit activities as well as squeeze individuals in the elite structure. Another dimension of the current exercises, which include the aircraft carrier George Washington and its strike group, is to demonstrate to China that, its strident objections to naval operations in the Yellow Sea notwithstanding, the United States not only has the right to operate in international waters but will do so in defense of its national interests. The point is not to stick a finger in China's eye; Washington would far prefer to cooperate with Beijing than to appear to challenge it in order to change North Korean behavior. But the U.S. has argued to China for a long time -- to little effect -- that its coddling of Pyongyang was not producing better behavior. Rather, it was enabling the North to pursue its contrarian ways, producing stalemate in the nuclear talks, the sinking of a South Korean naval vessel, and now a calculated attack on a South Korean island that killed civilians as well as military personnel. Thus, the American message to Beijing is: ""If you cannot help bring North Korea to cease its provocative behavior, we will be forced to take actions that, while not aimed at you, will discomfit you."" If this leads China to more seriously strive to rein North Korea in, all the better. Moreover, China shrilly insisted a few months ago that no U.S. naval exercises should take place in the Yellow Sea -- and especially that no aircraft carrier should enter those waters. In the face of that position, at some point the U.S. had to exercise its freedom of navigation rights. But the choice of timing -- not ideal with a Chinese state visit to Washington planned for January -- was dictated by Pyongyang's actions. Some observers say the only way to change North Korean behavior is to engage it. In fact, the United States is quite willing to engage the North, including in serious negotiations. But it is not willing to look the other way in the face of Pyongyang's aggressive military behavior and its blatant violation of its most basic pledges and UN resolutions regarding denuclearization. And it is not willing, as the North appears to want, to accept the DPRK as a de facto nuclear weapons state by sitting down with Pyongyang absent a demonstration by the North that it is committed to denuclearize (even if doubts abound regarding implementation). If the North does something meaningful to lower tensions with the South and to demonstrate ""sincerity"" about abandoning nuclear weapons, the prospects for resumed six-party denuclearization talks will improve. Meanwhile, however, the United States will continue to show strong support for its South Korean ally to counter Pyongyang's threatening actions.

"(CNN) -- A tug boat lookout was on a cellphone call to his mother's house when the barge it was ferrying collided with an anchored tour boat in the Delaware River last summer, according to a report released Monday by the National Transportation Safety Board. Two tourists died and 26 other passengers were injured in the July 7 collision between the barge and the tour boat near Philadelphia. The safety board report is a factual finding in an ongoing investigation and does not offer a conclusion as to what caused the accident. The accident occurred shortly after the tour boat, the DUKW 34, had dropped anchor to deal with a mechanical problem that caused smoked to pour out of the engine. Around 2:37 p.m., a barge propelled by the tug boat, the Caribbean Sea, collided with the tour boat, causing it to sink in 55 feet of water. According to the report, the Caribbean Sea's master was off duty and below deck. The mate was on navigation watch. The report states that, according to telephone records, the mate made a call to his mother's house at 2:32 p.m. The call, according to the report, lasted until 2:38, one minute after the accident occurred. The report also states that that between noon and the accident, when the mate was on navigation watch, he made 13 phone calls and answered six. In radio recordings released by the U.S. Coast Guard last year, an unidentified voice is heard yelling early in the incident, ""Hey ferry, ferry, ferry! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"" DUKW 34 crew members told investigators that they made radio calls to the tug boat Caribbean Sea that were not answered prior to the collision, the National Transportation Safety Board has said.","NTSB releases preliminary report on collision between Philadelphia tour boat and barge .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds turned out in two Saudi Arabian cities Friday to protest on what had been billed as a ""day of rage,"" according to activists, though a planned demonstration in the Middle Eastern nation's capital failed to materialize. The protests -- both made up largely of Shiite Muslims calling for the release of Shiite prisoners -- occurred despite a Saudi government ban on all kinds of public demonstrations. Demonstrators  in Hofuf, a city about 300 kilometers (185 miles) east of the Saudi  capital of Riyadh, began their march after Friday prayers, two activists told CNN . They asked not to be identified because of security concerns and  fear of reprisals. Three demonstrators were arrested by Saudi security forces, the activists said. The streets of Qatif, a predominantly Shiite city in eastern Saudi Arabia where several protests have taken place in recent days, were quiet early Friday. Ibrahim  al-Mugaiteeb, a Saudi human rights activist, told CNN that he saw ""no people in the streets and virtually no security presence."" But by Friday night, about 200 people were out demonstrating near Qatif, according to a Shiite activist. Saudi security forces were out and observed them, but there were no apparent arrests as the march ended peacefully. In the Saudi capital, Mohammed al-Qahtani, who heads the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association, told CNN that authorities had set up checkpoints on roads leading to the planned staging ground north of Riyadh near a courthouse. ""So far, I'm seeing no protesters out there,"" he said earlier Friday. These demonstrations came a day after more than 100 people had gathered in Qatif, according to two witnesses and an activist. At some point, the witnesses said, Saudi security forces shot to disperse the crowd. It was unknown if the forces fired rubber bullets or more lethal ammunition. Those injured were taken to Qatif Central Hospital for treatment, the activist and witnesses said. A human rights group in Saudi Arabia condemned the action, calling the use of force by police ""deplorable."" ""(The group) condemns, with the loudest and clearest words, the use of all kinds of force to disperse demonstrators particularly when live ammunition was used last night against the demonstrators in Qatif,"" the Human Rights First Society said in a statement released Friday. Last  week, about 24 protesters were detained in Qatif as they denounced ""the  prolonged detention"" of nine Shiite prisoners held without trial for  more than 14 years, Amnesty International said. The protests in Saudi Arabia come as unrest brews in parts of the Middle East and North Africa and has caused major changes in places like Egypt and Tunisia. Some in the majority Sunni kingdom have followed similar demands across the Arab world for more freedom and democracy. Still, one expert said he would be surprised if the demonstrations gained traction among the Saudi majority, noting that there does not appear to a high level of animosity toward the nation's rulers as there are in other countries. ""The big difference is that people in Saudi Arabia don't want a revolution  to happen -- they just want more reforms and liberalization,"" said Christopher Boucek, a Saudi expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank. ""I really think the  vast majority of the people there, no matter what they think of the government,  they probably like the King,"" he added. ""King Abdullah is still very popular."" CNN's Elise Labott contributed to this report.","NEW: Scores of people protest in Hofuf and 3 are arrested, two activists say .

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi returned to haunt Arsenal as his two goals helped Barcelona into the quarterfinals of the Champions League after a 3-1 win in Spain. The Argentina striker scored four goals to knock the English club out of last year's competition and he starred again as the Spanish champions secured their place in the last eight with a 4-3 aggregate win. Messi opened the scoring just before halftime before the English club pulled level thanks to Sergio Busquets' own goal. Robin van Persie was shown a second yellow card for shooting on goal after the referee's whistle had gone -- the striker claimed he couldn't hear it amid the noise from 95,000 fans in the stadium. Barcelona then took control as Xavi edged them ahead from a flowing move before Messi grabbed his second from the penalty spot after Laurent Koscielny tripped Pedro. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was involved in a furious confrontation with the referee upon the final whistle while the statistics showed his side had failed to register a single shot on goal, compared to Barca's 19. Blog: Wenger was right, the ref killed the game . Arsenal had been boosted by the return of injured duo Van Persie and captain Cesc Fabregas before the game but they were on the back foot for the majority of the first half. And they lost goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny after only 16 minutes when he damaged a finger saving Dani Alves' free kick. Manuel Almunia replaced him. Dutch striker Van Persie was then involved in an altercation with Alves and was shown a yellow card. Just before the break Messi broke the deadlock, with help from an unlikely source. Fabregas' risky back heel was intercepted by Andres Iniesta, he fed Messi and the striker clipped the ball over Almunia before smashing a volley into the net. Out of nothing Arsenal equalized on 53 minutes when Busquets inadvertently headed Nasri's corner into his own net and at that stage, the English side were going through. But Van Persie was shown a second yellow card for shooting on goal after being flagged offside. The striker claimed he couldn't hear the referee's whistle, which was blown less than a second before he struck his shot. Within 16 minutes of Van Persie's dismissal Arsenal were 3-1 down. First Xavi finished off a neat move after David Villa's pass, then Pedro was fouled by Koscielny and Messi scored from the penalty spot. Almunia made a string of vital saves to keep Arsenal in it before the visitors had a late chance to steal the tie when Jack Wilshere put substitute Nicklas Bendtner through on goal but the Danish striker's first touch was poor and he lost possession. After the game both Van Persie and Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger criticized the referee. On his sending off Van Persie told Sky Sports: ""I can't understand that view from the ref. One second from his whistle to my shot is a joke. ""He's been a joke all evening. I don't know why he's here tonight. In my opinion that ref killed the game. There were 95,000 people jumping up so how could I hear his whistle?"" Wenger added: ""He [the referee] must never have played football at all to do that. I told him what I think about his decision face to face. There's not a lot more to say about that."" In the evening's other match Shakhtar Donetsk thrashed Italian giants Roma 3-0 in Ukraine to run out 6-2 winners on aggregate. Goals from Tomas Hubschman, Willan and Eduardo settled proceedings for Shakhtar, who led 3-2 from the first leg in Italy. Marco Borriello missed a penalty for Roma with the score at 1-0.","Barcelona beat Arsenal 4-3 on aggregate to reach Champions League quarterfinals .

"(CNN) -- A Brazilian journalist detained by authorities while reporting from Libya was released Thursday and will leave the country Friday, Libyan authorities said. The whereabouts of Andrei Netto, a correspondent for Brazil's Estado do Sao Paulo newspaper, were unknown since Sunday, the last time he communicated with his newspaper. He is staying at the home of the Brazilian ambassador in Libya pending his removal, the newspaper reported. Netto was detained for entering the country illegally through the Tunisian border, the Libyan Embassy in Brazil said in a written statement. Another reporter, Ghaith Abdul-Ahad of Britain's Guardian newspaper, was with Netto at the time of his detention, but officials gave no information on him. ""His detention was for his own protection, given the large concern of the government for the safety of the foreign media,"" the Libyan Embassy said. Before Thursday, the last that Estado knew about its reporter was that he was around the city of Zawiya, a scene of fighting between opposition forces and forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. That was around the last time The Guardian heard from Abdul-Ahad, the newspaper reported. The British newspaper has been in contact with Libyan government officials in Tripoli and London regarding his disappearance, the newspaper reported. Abdul-Ahad, an Iraqi national, has been a staff correspondent for the paper since 2004, the newspaper said. On Wednesday, three BBC journalists who had also been detained outside of Zawiya told of beatings and mock executions that they and other detainees were subjected to by their captors. The three -- Feras Killani, Goktay Koraltan and Chris Cobb-Smith -- said that Libyan authorities took them into custody and seized their cameras and other equipment Monday at a checkpoint six miles south of Zawiya.","Andrei Netto had been detained by Libyan authorities .

"Camp Verde, Arizona (CNN) -- Testimony continued Tuesday at the trial of a self-help speaker charged in the death of three people at a sweat lodge in Arizona, with a volunteer saying she and others received little training on how to assist people. Jennifer Haley, who served at the 2009 event near Sedona, took the stand for the third day Tuesday to talk about how she and other ""Dream Team"" members tried to help ceremony participants, some of whom vomited. One reportedly was burned after coming in contact with hot rocks, according to testimony. Author James Arthur Ray is charged with three counts of reckless manslaughter in connection with the October 2009 incident at a spiritual retreat outside Sedona. If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison on each count. Haley described hosing people off, and spoke of one man named Dennis who repeatedly said he didn't want to die. Prior to the beginning of the sweat lodge ceremony, Haley testified, Dream Team members received only about 10 minutes of training. Haley, who was a participant in a 2007 ceremony, said Ray told the group ""to expect that anything could happen: There could be throwing up, some people could get delirious ... anything could happen; it could get a little crazy ... expect it, it was normal."" Haley also testified they were not told how to help anyone who was unconscious. She said she performed CPR, despite having no training, on a man who appeared to not be breathing. The witness was outside the sweat lodge during the incident. ""There was no suggestion anything could go wrong,"" said Haley, who on that day assisted all three people who died. Eventually, Haley testified, a nurse and doctor rendered aid. Under cross-examination, Haley said participants had a choice of whether to have their heads shaved, which they were encouraged to do in order ""to let go of their vanity."" The defense is trying to show participants had free will during their time at the event. Haley also said ceremony participants had been warned about how hot the lodge would be and that Ray never told anyone who left during the event they would have to return. A man who burned his hand voluntarily returned to the lodge. A nearby cooling station included fruit, water and fortified water. Haley also said that Ray was unhappy with volunteers, including Lizbeth Marie Neuman, who drank wine one evening before the ceremony, saying it was prohibited. Neuman, 49, of Prior Lake, Minnesota, died nine days after the ceremony. Asked by a defense attorney if the wine episode had anything to do with Neuman's death, Haley said, ""I believe that her feeling shameful absolutely had everything to do with her dying in that sweat lodge because she was more than that."" On Friday -- the fourth day of the trial -- a woman testified that Ray dismissed her alert about the failing condition of a woman who was one of three people who eventually died. Speaking in Yavapai County Superior Court in Camp Verde, Laura Tucker said she twice told Ray -- the second time more loudly and urgently -- she was worried about Neuman, whom she had helped support, during a brief break in the ritual. ""(Ray) said Liz has done this before -- she knows what she's doing,"" Tucker said, claiming that Ray did not check on Neuman despite her concerns. Kirby Brown, 38, of Westtown, New York, and James Shore, 40, of Milwaukee, died the night of the event. At least 15 others who took part in the ritual fell ill, but more than 40 others were uninjured. Ray, 53, had conducted his Spiritual Warrior Retreat for six years at a cost of about $10,000 for participants. The so-called sweat lodge -- which was 5 feet tall and 23 feet wide, and built to accommodate up to 75 people -- was the site of a purification ritual for participants modeled on Native American customs. Prosecutors argue that the lodge -- made of willow trees and branches, and covered with tarpaulins and blankets -- was heated to a perilously high temperature, causing the participants to suffer dehydration and heatstroke. Ray poured water over heated stones in a pit in the center, in order to create steam. The sweat lodge ceremony consisted of eight rounds, with each round lasting 10 to 15 minutes. While they were not prevented from leaving, participants have said they were encouraged to wait until the breaks between rounds. Ray encouraged participants to hydrate throughout the retreat and warned them the sweat lodge would be very hot, his attorney has said. Participants signed a release form saying that the retreat activities could include a sweat lodge with enclosed spaces and high temperatures, Luis Li said in his opening statement last week. But prosecutors maintain Ray psychologically pressured participants to remain in the lodge even when they weren't feeling well, contributing to their deaths. Under cross-examination Friday, Tucker acknowledged signing a release form that warned of an ""inherent risk"" of injury in some activities in Ray's program.

"London (CNN) -- Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Andrew have met to discuss concerns that more revelations could surface about the prince's friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, a U.S. financier who was sentenced to 18 months in prison in 2008 for soliciting a minor for prostitution, according to a royal source who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Prince Andrew's office recently declined to comment when asked about the prince's friendship with Epstein. Also called the Duke of York, Prince Andrew is Queen Elizabeth's second son and the brother of Prince Charles, who is next in line to the throne. He also is the United Kingdom's special representative for international trade and investment. The queen and Prince Andrew discussed Epstein, the royal source said, but details about their talk were not immediately available. The British government periodically reviews the prince's position. The next meeting is scheduled to happen this summer. Some politicians and royal commentators have said that Prince Andrew is an embarrassment to Britain and the royal family. In leaked diplomatic documents published by WikiLeaks last year, the U.S. ambassador in the central Asian state of Kyrgyzstan, Tatiana Gfoeller, reportedly said that the prince -- during a business lunch in 2008 -- was ""astonishingly candid. The discussion at times verged on the rude (from the British side)."" The prince has not commented publicly on characterizations put forth in the leaked documents. ""[Prince] Andrew hasn't really done the royal family any favors,"" said royal historian Christopher Warwick. ""As fourth in line to the throne, he is a senior member of the royal family."" ""All members of the royal family have an ambassadorial responsibility, particularly the senior members. Part of the royal remit is to take the monarchy abroad and wave the flag for Britain plc. We have to recognize how immensely marvelous the queen is, she's never put a foot wrong,"" he added. CNN's Thair Shaikh contributed to this report .","Prince Andrew is friends with Jeffrey Epstein .

"(CNN) -- The lawyer for Joran Van der Sloot, the Dutch national accused of killing a 21-year-old woman in Lima, Peru, last year, said Monday he has asked the court to charge his client with the lesser offense of manslaughter. ""In his statement to the police, Joran admitted that he committed the crime, but it was not in the way that the police said it happened,"" said attorney Maximo Altez. ""We have submitted a motion to show that he shouldn't be charged with aggravated murder, but with violent emotion murder."" ""Violent emotion murder"" is the equivalent of manslaughter in the United States. Van der Sloot faces up to five years in prison if convicted on the lesser charge and a minimum of 15 years if found guilty of first-degree murder. Altez gave a copy of the motion, dated late last year, to ""In Session."" A judge has not yet made a ruling on it, he said. Van der Sloot has been charged with first-degree murder and robbery in the case of 21-year-old Stephany Flores. Authorities found Flores' body in a Lima hotel room registered to him in June last year. He is perhaps best-known as the prime suspect in the 2005 disappearance of an American teenager in Aruba. Van de Sloot was arrested twice in connection with the Natalee Holloway case, but was not charged. Police have said Van der Sloot admitted that he attacked Flores on May 30 after she read an e-mail on his computer connected with the Holloway case. After killing Flores, police say, Van der Sloot took money and bank cards from her wallet and fled to Chile, where he was arrested June 3. He was returned the next day to Peru. ""My client ... admits having murdered the victim, but not with ferocity, for profit or pleasure, nor any of the other element(s) that make up this murder, but only by violent emotion that overtook him at the time he was attacked by the victim,"" Altez's motion read. The lawyer contends there is no evidence of robbery. Van der Sloot also faces federal wire fraud and extortion charges in the United States, where prosecutors say he demanded more than $250,000 from Holloway's family in return for disclosing the location of her body. ""I hope he remembers that there's a hold on him and that he faces up to 20 years for extortion here in the U.S.,"" said John Kelly, the attorney for Holloway's mother. He said Van der Sloot is a ""prolific liar."" Van der Sloot is being held at the Miguel Castro Castro Prison. He is spending his time teaching English to the guards and is still in solitary confinement, his lawyer said.

"(CNN) -- Everton hit back from going a goal behind to earn a 1-1 home draw with Birmingham City, a result that lifts the visitors out of the bottom three of the Premier League table. English League Cup winners Birmingham came into the match third from bottom and they took a vital lead in the 17th minute. Jean Beausejour was on target with a close-range header after out-jumping defender Tony Hibbert from a Jordon Mutch cross -- the Chilean's second goal in as many matches. But Everton levelled just before half-time when Dutchman John Heitinga curled a superb shot into the top corner, after Birmingham failed to clear Leon Osman's corner. Everton enjoyed the majority of possession and chances after the break. Louis Saha's shot was stopped by Mutch's brave block while Birmingham goalkeeper Ben Foster saved well from Jermaine Beckford's close-range strike. The result means Everton move up a place to ninth in the table, while the point sees Birmingham rise above West Ham on goal difference to 17th place.","Everton hit back from going a goal behind to earn a 1-1 draw with Birmingham .

"(CNN) -- Actor Charlie Sheen, fired from his hit comedy series, has filed a $100 million lawsuit against Warner Bros. Television and Chuck Lorre, the creator of ""Two and a Half Men,"" a Los Angeles Superior Court spokeswoman said Thursday. The lawsuit, which also seeks punitive damages and recovery of unpaid wages, claims intentional interference with contractual relations and breach of contract, among other contentions. In addition to Sheen, 9th Step Productions -- a corporation formed by Sheen to contract out his acting services on the series -- also is a plaintiff in the lawsuit. Warner Bros. Television fired Sheen on Monday after he had gone on a two-week public rant against the show's producers. Howard Weitzman, Lorre's attorney, called the allegations ""as recklessly false and unwarranted as Mr. Sheen's rantings in the media. ""These accusations are simply imaginary,"" Weitzman said in a statement. ""This lawsuit is about a fantasy 'lottery' pay-day for Charlie Sheen. Chuck Lorre's concern has been and continues to be about Mr. Sheen's health."" Warner Bros. had no comment Thursday. Sheen, 45, has been known for his highly publicized marital, legal and substance abuse problems as much as his acting. ""Two and a Half Men"" was put on hiatus after Sheen entered a rehabilitation program in January, and production was halted after he blasted Lorre and Alcoholics Anonymous in a February 24 radio interview. Sheen said he is pursuing claims for the entire cast and crew to be paid for the balance of the season's 24 episodes. In his lawsuit, the actor claims Lorre ""believes himself to be so wealthy and powerful that he can unilaterally decide to take money away from the dedicated cast and crew ... in order to serve his own ego and self-interest."" It claims Lorre made Sheen ""the scapegoat for Lorre's own conduct."" Lorre and Warner Bros. generated more than $1 billion from his work, Sheen states. Warner Bros. capitulated to Lorre's desire to punish Sheen for critical remarks about the show's creator, the lawsuit states. Sheen contends he went on the radio only after years of Lorre disparaging him. It also claims Lorre stands to make more money on his other shows, including ""The Big Bang Theory,"" and wanted to make those programs flourish at the expense of ""Two and a Half Men"" and because of personal animus toward Sheen. The lawsuit claims Lorre and Warner Bros. conspired to conjure up a pretext to end the series and fire the actor, ""to make him their scapegoat despite the fact that Mr. Sheen was sober, and was ready, willing and able to perform."" Despite stopping production on the sitcom, Warner Bros. Television said last week it will pay the show's crew for the four episodes initially set to begin production this week. In interviews, Sheen threatened to sue CBS for shutting down the show, demanded a raise from $2 million to $3 million per episode and insisted he was ""clean, focused and ready to get back to work."" ""I feel more alive, I feel more focused, I feel more energetic,"" Sheen said on CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" last week. ""I'm on a quest to claim absolute victory on every front."" In a tweet after the lawsuit was filed, Sheen wrote, ""Torpedo away ... You corporate Trolls were warned. And now you've been served!"" Warner Bros. Television is owned by Time Warner Inc., the parent company of CNN. CNN's Brittany Kaplan contributed to this report.","Sheen's claims are ""imaginary,"" says Lorre's attorney .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A 5-year-old California boy, missing for two years after his parents lost custody and then allegedly abducted him, was found undernourished and weighing 38 pounds, Los Angeles County authorities said Tuesday. The boy, tracked down Friday, was returned Saturday evening to the custody of his maternal grandparents in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, about 40 miles south of downtown Los Angeles, authorities said. The boy was undernourished and had other medical conditions, authorities said. ""He is beginning to adjust to living in a normal environment,"" Deputy U.S. Marshal David Dominguez said in a statement. Although doctors say the boy's recovery will take a while, he should thrive with proper medical attention, Dominguez said. The boy is already scheduled to attend school and is getting his appetite back, authorities said. His parents, Ausar Allah-El and Serenity Sol-El, are in custody in New Orleans on charges related to the alleged 2009 child abduction, with bail set at $100,000, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Captain Mike Parker said in a statement. Extradition to Los Angeles County is being sought by sheriff's investigators, Parker said. The boy was abducted from a Carson, California, child care center on April 25, 2009, when he was 3 years old and in the custody of his maternal grandparents, authorities said. For the past two years, the boy and his parents were apparently living on the streets, Parker said. ""It seemed as though (the boy) and his parents had disappeared without a trace for almost two years,"" Parker said in a statement. The parents had lost custody of their son after Los Angeles County officials made ""repeated attempts"" to help the parents care for their son and found the boy suffering ""from numerous medical conditions that could have been prevented with the proper care and medication,"" the statement said. ""His parents refused to provide the child with necessary medical appointments, dental exams, occupational therapists and ophthalmology appointments,"" the statement said. Asked why the parents allegedly did this, Parker said, ""Apparently, they have some type of belief that affects what they feed him and what type of medical care that they will allow him to receive."" Then, on February 20, a National Park Services police officer noticed ""something odd"" about a man panhandling in Louis Armstrong Park in New Orleans, and as the officer interviewed the man, the panhandler texted someone on his cell phone, Parker said in a statement. A warrants check revealed the man to be the boy's father, who was wanted by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department for child abduction, according to authorities. After the father was in custody, he indicated he had been with his wife and child, and U.S. Marshals authorities searched for them for two weeks, Parker said. The mother and son had been staying with her friends and acquaintances in the New Orleans area, and authorities apprehended her and the boy following a surveillance, Parker said. The family of three had been living there for at least a year, though the couple may not have been living together most recently, Parker said.","NEW: Authorities: The family had been living in the New Orleans area most recently .

"(CNN)  -- Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has launched an attack on European football's governing body UEFA after being charged with improper conduct for his behavior during Tuesday's Champions League defeat by Barcelona. Wenger clashed with referee Massimo Busacca at the end of the English team's 3-1 loss to the Spanish champions in the away leg of their last-16 tie in Europe's top club competition. The Frenchman reacted angrily when striker Robin van Persie was awarded a second yellow card and controversially sent off in the 56th minute of the game for shooting at goal after Busacca had signaled for offside, with the score still 1-1. ""I deny completely any charge. I do not understand where it's from. They (UEFA) do not punish me. It is Arsenal Football Club who has been punished,"" Wenger told reporters at a press conference on Thursday. Was Wenger right -- did the ref kill the game? ""We are out of the Champions League and have lost one of our big ambitions, and on top of that we have to say sorry when we have done nothing wrong. ""It would be good for UEFA to show some humility, to apologize for what has happened, not charge people who have done nothing wrong."" France midfielder Samir Nasri was also charged for improper conduct after he approached Busacca in the tunnel at the end of the game. Netherlands star Van Persie said he did not hear the whistle for offside amid the noise of the 95,000-strong crowd at the Nou Camp. Wenger was immediately outspoken in his criticism of Busacca following the incident, and accused the Swiss official of ""killing the game."" Arsenal won the home leg of the tie 2-1 in London, and would have reached the quarterfinals if the score in Barcelona had remained 1-1. ""It is a shame for me that the referee took the decision to send Robin van Persie off. It was the wrong decision,"" Wenger said. Wenger charged by UEFA after Barca clash . ""This decision frustrated us and everyone who loves football. The first leg was a fantastic advert for football and the second game has been destroyed. People now will only remember the sending-off."" It is the second game in succession that Wenger has criticized a referee's performance, following his condemnation of the officials during the 0-0 home draw with Sunderland last Saturday. The exit from the Champions League came just nine days after the Gunners' heartbreaking last-minute English League Cup final loss to Birmingham. Wenger had further bad news for Arsenal fans when he confirmed that skipper Cesc Fabregas had been ruled out of Saturday's FA Cup quarterfinal clash with Premier League leaders Manchester United. ""He had a recurrence of his hamstring and will be out for the next game, maybe for the next two games,"" Wenger said of the Spaniard, who returned from injury to face his boyhood club Barcelona. Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny will also miss the trip to Old Trafford, after the Polish player sustained a finger injury 18 minutes into the Barcelona game and had to be substituted. ""He has a dislocated finger with a tendon problem,"" Wenger said. ""He had a scan on Wednesday but we need the assessment of a specialist to see where we go from here. He is out for a while, for how long I cannot tell you."" With Manuel Almunia now the club's only fit goalkeeper -- Lukasz Fabianski is also out injured -- Wenger may be forced to search for a replacement on an emergency loan.","Arsene Wenger hits out at UEFA and denies charge of improper conduct against him .

"New York (CNN) -- Galleon Group founder Raj Rajaratnam used ""stolen business information to steal tens of millions of dollars,"" a federal prosecutor said today in opening statements of what could be the largest insider trading trial in years. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Streeter laid out in detail his case against Rajarantnam, a Wharton Business school graduate who Streeter said ""exploited a corrupt network of people"" for his own illicit gain. Streeter cited wiretaps the government was able to obtain in 2008 to build its case. Rajaratnam is charged with 14 counts of conspiracy and securities fraud. The government alleges he made $45 million from insider trading tips and conspired with others, including employees at Galleon, board presidents and consultants. A jury of seven women and five men has been seated for the trial, which is expected to last 10 weeks. Rajaratnam could face 20 years in jail if convicted. It took Streeter about an hour to run through the names of witnesses who will testify against Raj, who have ""already pled guilty to insider trading."" Judge Richard Holwell's courtroom was overflowing with guests and media, causing two overflow rooms to be opened up. After the government presented its opening statements, defense attorney John Dowd painstakingly went through almost every charge against his client, saying, ""He is not guilty; he only traded on expert information."" Dowd said the government has it ""wrong, and they want you to believe the words of the unbelievable."" He attacked the credibility of the presumed government witnesses, noting that each one faces 25 years in prison. ""They are on a leash,"" Dowd said. ""The prosecution holds the keys to the jailhouse."" Court will resume Thursday at 9:30 a.m.","Galleon Group founder Raj Rajaratnam goes on trial on insider trading charges .

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice as Real Madrid closed the gap on Barcelona to seven points at the top of La Liga with a 4-1 home win over Real Sociedad on Sunday. Defending champions Barca went 10 points clear on Saturday night after their record breaking 16th consecutive victory -- Lionel Messi's hat-trick defeating Atletico Madrid 3-0 and ensuring Pep Guardiola's side overtook the winning run set by the great Real Madrid side in the 1960-61 season. But Real looked determined to close the gap and took a seventh minute lead when Kaka slotted the ball home after a poor clearance from Gorka Elustondo. Ronaldo had come under some criticism after going four matches without a goal, but he ended that streak with a first-half double. First the Portuguese international turned a defender on the edge of the area before firing home and he then headed in a corner for his 25th goal of the season, overtaking Messi at the top of the scoring charts in the process. The visitors pulled a goal back when Raul Tamudo's shot was blocked by goalkeeper Iker Casillas -- but the rebound cannoned off Alvaro Arbeloa into the net. However, Real Madrid finished the job when Emmanuel Adebayor netted his first league goal for the club following his loan move from Manchester City. Meanwhile, Valencia maintained their recent impressive run of form with a 2-0 success over Hercules, to move to within a point of third-placed Villarreal. Goals from Aritz Aduriz and a Tino Costa free-kick gave Valencia their sixth win in seven games and closed the gap on Villarreal, who suffered a shock 1-0 defeat at home to lowly Levante on Sunday. Elsewhere, Sevilla are now six points off a Europa League place after being held to a 0-0 draw by bottom side Malaga in the Andalusian derby.","Real Madrid close gap on Barcelona to seven points at the top of La Liga .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- A new sexual abuse lawsuit was filed Monday against the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, Cardinal Justin Rigali and other archdiocese staffers on behalf of a Delaware man who grew up in Philadelphia, clergy abuse attorneys said. Phil Gaughan claims the Reverend John E. Gillespie sexually abused him from 1994 to 1997 while attending Our Lady of Calvary parish in Philadelphia, according to the civil complaint. Gaughan, now 31, came forward because of his 7-year-old son, he said Monday at a news conference in front of City Hall. ""I don't want anyone to go through what I have gone through,"" he said. ""Words can't describe it, nothing has changed (with the church)."" When the alleged sexual abuse began, Gaughan was 14 and assigned to the post of parish sacristan -- someone who is responsible for preparing the church sanctuary for Mass, as well as cleaning up afterward -- according to the complaint. ""Phil was brave enough to come forward and put a face to the real tragedy that's been happening not only to him, but probably countless other in the Philadelphia Archdiocese,"" said Dan Monahan, Gaughan's attorney. Raised Catholic, Gaughan now struggles with his faith. He does not attend Mass and will not let his son become a parish sacristan. Gaughan kept his secret until October 2010 when he told his wife, Michelle. He confided in his parents and his large extended Irish-Catholic family. He also contacted the archdiocese's Victim Assistance Coordinator, to no avail, he said. His first conversation lasted roughly 15 minutes. During a second conversation he was referred to a doctor, he said. ""I want change. Something has to be done to protect the kids,"" he said. Gillespie was a family friend for nearly 40 years, said Philip J. Gaughan, Phil's father. ""It's a shock for a parent, it challenges our faith,"" the senior Gaughan said. ""You have to think, how didn't we know, and why didn't he tell us."" At the time, he said, he and his wife were proud their son was chosen to work in the church. The complaint comes in the wake of the Philadelphia Attorney's Office charging  on February 10 three Philadelphia priests and a parochial school teacher with raping and assaulting boys in their care, while a former official with the Philadelphia Archdiocese was accused of allowing the abusive priests to have access to children, following the release of a scathing grand jury report. The lawsuit was filed in response to new information released in the 2011 grand jury report that involves Monsignor William Lynn, who is facing criminal charges for endangering the welfare of children and having knowledge about a perpetrator. Lynn served as the secretary for clergy under the former Philadelphia Archbishop Bevilacqua. This year's grand jury report is the second priest sexual abuse grand jury report in Philadelphia, and the first time that a Catholic church leader has been charged criminally for an alleged cover-up. The lawsuit filed Monday alleges ""Archdiocese officials conspired to endanger the safety of the plaintiff when they actively concealed their knowledge of priest's previous offenses, lied to parishioners, and created a sham sexual abuse victim assistance program for the Archdiocese,"" according to a statement from Gaughan's attorneys. He is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. ""This isn't about the money,"" Gaughan said. ""No other kid should have to go through this. No other person should have to live with this for two minutes, let alone 15 years."" Gaughan's attorneys filed another sexual abuse lawsuit on February 14 on behalf of a Philadelphia man who claims two priests at two separate schools sexually abused him, said attorney Dan Monahan. ""Both of these cases clearly demonstrate the nefarious ways that the hierarchy of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia utilized to not only intimidate survivors through their so called ""Victim's Assistance"" program, but also how they actively engaged in a coverup of known sex abusers who were permitted to continue victimizing untold numbers of other children,"" Monahan said.

"(CNN) -- It is already one of the world's most-watched sporting events, but English Premier League officials hope to extend the football competition's popularity with a tour that gives fans the chance to experience it close up. Starting in Abu Dhabi later this month, the official Premier League trophy will be at the center of an interactive exhibition which will also go to Dubai, Qatar and Saudi Arabia until the end of April. The tour will then head to Hong Kong during the pre-season Barclays Asia Trophy in late July, and in 2012 and 2013 it will visit China, South-East Asia, the United States, India and South Africa. The Premier League, sponsored by banking group Barclays, broadcasts 380 matches each season to 580 million homes in more than 200 countries. In 2009-10, an estimated cumulative global audience of 2.90 billion viewed more than 110,000 hours of coverage, while 13 million-plus fans attended matches in England. League officials have mooted the possibility of playing a round of matches outside of Britain, but football's world ruling body FIFA rejected the idea. ""We are excited about joining long-term partners Barclays to put on our first official trophy tour for fans around the world,"" Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said. ""We want to show them what is at the heart of our competition: the trophy itself, as that is what every player and manager competes to get their hands on; the fantastic football as played by our 20 clubs, because that is what excites hundreds of millions week-in week-out; and the history and tradition of English football, as that is what helps create the huge interest in the competition."" The exhibition will be housed in four domes, which profile the league's 20 clubs, simulate the experience of a match-day, showcase the trophy and allow fans to picture themselves lifting it against a green-screen. The half-hour tour is free, but entrance must be pre-booked through the official website. The schedule starts at Abu Dhabi's The Corniche from March 18-20, then Dubai's Jumeirah Beach Residence on April 1-3, Doha April 16-18 and Riyadh April 28-30.","Middle East football fans will be the first to experience Premier League trophy tour .

"Washington (CNN) -- Last month, Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano said the threat of terrorism to the United States is at its ""most heightened"" since the September 11, 2001, attacks -- a threat that she asserted has taken on a new and disquieting form because of the growing emphasis by Islamist terrorist groups on recruiting Americans. Napolitano's warning came at the first in a series of hearings convened by the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Peter King, R-New York, who is determined to investigate what he terms the radicalization of Muslim-American communities, a problem he says is compounded by their lack of cooperation with law enforcement. The hearings, scheduled to begin in earnest Thursday, have caused consternation among many Muslim-Americans who worry that they will devolve into a McCarthyite witch hunt. So, how real is the ""homegrown"" Islamist terrorist threat? The New America Foundation and Syracuse University's Maxwell School of Public Policy examined the post-9/11 cases of Americans or U.S. residents convicted of or charged with some form of jihadist terrorist activity directed against the U.S., as well as the cases of American citizens who have traveled overseas to join a jihadist terrorist group. Read the full report . The number of such cases has certainly spiked in the past two years. In 2009 and 2010, there were 76, almost half of the total since 9/11. This increase was driven in part by plots that could have killed dozens, such as the attempt by Faisal Shahzad, a Pakistani-American, to bomb Times Square in May. It was also driven by nine arrests in FBI sting operations and the 31 people who were charged with fundraising, recruiting or traveling abroad to fight for the Somali terrorist group Al-Shabaab. Only four of the homegrown plots since 9/11 progressed to an actual attack in the U. S. -- attacks that resulted in 17 deaths. The most notable was the 2009 shooting at Fort Hood, Texas, in which Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan allegedly killed 13 people. By way of comparison, 73 people were killed in hate crimes in the U.S. between 2001 and 2009, according to the FBI. And more than 15,000 people are murdered in the U.S. every year. None of the 175 individual jihadist terrorism cases we investigated involved plotting with chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear weapons. Given all the post-9/11 concerns about terrorists armed with weapons of mass destruction, this is one of our more positive findings. The U.S. military, fighting wars in two Muslim countries, is firmly in the cross hairs of homegrown jihadist militants. Around one-third of such cases involved a U.S. military target, ranging from the U.S. Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, to American soldiers serving overseas. And in a third of the cases, the individuals involved were training on weapons or were manufacturing or acquiring weaponry. Contrary to King's assertion that Muslim-American communities have not cooperated with law enforcement, more than one-fifth of the post-9/11 Islamist terrorism cases originated with tips from Muslim community members or involved the cooperation of the families of alleged plotters. (Not included in our total were the tips from the local community that led to investigations into the disappearances of Somali-American youths in Minnesota to fight for Al-Shabaab, because it is difficult to put an exact number on the cases affected by those tips.) Tips from Muslim communities and families warned authorities, for instance, about the danger posed by Daniel Boyd, who was planning to attack the Quantico base in 2009, as well as the ""D.C. 5,"" who tried to join militant groups in Pakistan the same year. A third of cases we surveyed involved the use of an informant, while a further one in 10 involved an undercover federal agent. (Five cases involved both). The large number of informants and undercover agents driving these cases raises the issue of how many of these arrests happened because the defendants were entrapped. While no one in a terrorism case since 9/11 has successfully used an entrapment defense, some of these cases certainly raise the specter of entrapment. For instance, in 2009, a government informant promised $250,000 in cash and a BMW to a group of impoverished men if they would participate in a plot to attack synagogues in the Bronx and an Air National Guard base in Newburgh, New York. We also found that rather than being the uneducated, young Arab-American immigrants of popular imagination, the homegrown militants do not fit any particular socioeconomic or ethnic profile. Their average age is 30. Of the cases for which ethnicity could be determined, only a quarter are of Arab descent, while 13% are Caucasian, 10% are African-American, 18% are South Asian, 20% are of Somali descent and the rest are either mixed race or of other ethnicities. About half the cases involved a U.S.-born American citizen, while another third were naturalized citizens. And of the 94 cases where education could be ascertained, nearly two-thirds pursued at least some college courses, and one in 10 had completed a master's degree, Ph.D. or doctoral equivalent. The data on jihadist terrorism cases shows that there is a tiny but growing problem of militancy in the Muslim-American community, but it also shows that the consequences of this are quite small. King has every right to investigate this phenomenon, but given the larger domestic problem of hate crimes, his committee would be well-served to focus on that issue as well. And the data shows that Muslim-American communities may prove to be the congressman's best ally in the fight against radicals in their midst. Given that finding, the worst possible outcome of King's hearings would be to alienate the very constituency that is best-suited to root out the militants in their community.","Rep.

"(CNN)  -- Co-hosts Sri Lanka became the first team to book a quarterfinal place at the Cricket World Cup after demolishing Zimbabwe by 139 runs on Thursday thanks to a superb all-round performance from Tillakaratne Dilshan. The man-of-the-match became just the 11th player to score a hundred and take four wickets in a 50-over international. Opening batsmen Dilshan and Upul Tharanga shared a competition-record first-wicket stand of 282 as Sri Lanka made 327-6 in front of a home crowd at the Pallekele stadium in Kandy. The duo smashed the previous record of 194 set by Pakistan's Saeed Anwar and Wajahatullah Wasti in 1999, and also secured the fourth-highest partnership ever in a one-day international game. And both openers scored a century to set a new first in a World Cup match, with Dilshan making 144 from 131 deliveries faced and Tharanga 133 off 141 after Zimbabwe captain Elton Chigumbura won the toss and opted to field first. Tharanga was the first to fall near the end of the 45th over, becoming the first of four victims for fast bowler Chris Mpofu, and Zimbabwe did well to restrict the 1996 champions to just another 45 runs from the final five overs. The African side made a solid 116-run start in reply before world record-holder Muttiah Muralitharan broke the partnership, dismissing Regis Chakabva for 35 as the first of three wickets in his final match in his home city before retiring after the tournament. The Zimbabweans then lost their last nine wickets for just 63 runs to be all out for 188 in 39 overs as Angelo Mathews got rid of Tatenda Taibu (4) and opener Brendan Taylor (80) before Dilshan had Prosper Utseya (4) stumped by wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara. Dilshan found himself on a hat-trick after trapping Craig Ervine leg before wicket for 17 and then having Greg Lamb superbly caught at slip by Mahela Jayawardene -- but the captain then spilled a similar chance off Graeme Cremer from the next delivery. Dilshan also dismissed Tinashe Panyangara lbw for a duck to end with the remarkable figures of 4-4 off three overs, while Muralitharan bowled last man Mpofu to end with 3-34. ""Dilshan has that magic touch with bat, ball and on the field,"" Sri Lanka skipper Kumar Sangakkara told reporters. ""Murali is a champion. That's why he is rated the best in the world. When the tough times come, he stands up."" The result put Sri Lanka top of Group A, a point ahead of second-placed New Zealand, who Sangakkara's team face in their final match on March 18. Zimbabwe trail Pakistan and Australia in fifth place, and face a difficult battle to progress after three defeats from four of their six matches. They must win their remaining two matches against Pakistan on March 14 and Kenya on March 20 to have any chance of making the top-four. Friday's action moves to Group B, where Ireland seek to follow up last week's upset win over England by beating the West Indies in Chandigarh, having lost to India on Sunday. England, who bounced back from that setback to defeat South Africa on Sunday, take on co-hosts Bangladesh in Chittagong.","Sri Lanka first team to qualify for the quarterfinals of the Cricket World Cup .

"Madison, Wisconsin (CNN) -- A contentious political battle that brought thousands to the state Capitol drew to a close Friday as Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker signed into law a bill that curbs the bargaining rights of most state workers. ""We were elected to make tough decisions,"" Walker told reporters, lauding his administration's efforts to prevent employee layoffs and tax increases. ""We gave local governments the tools they need to balance their budgets."" Republicans cleared a final hurdle to the controversial proposal Thursday, passing the bill one day after the state's GOP-controlled Senate approved an amended version of the measure, despite the absence of 14 Democratic senators who fled the state to prevent a necessary quorum of 20 votes. The amended bill stripped the spending components out of the original proposal, enabling lawmakers to pass the measure with fewer votes. Cries of ""Shame, shame, shame!"" filled the Capitol building after the Assembly vote. The weeks-long standoff reached a fever pitch Thursday after a spokesman for Republican Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald said the leader received two death threats that detailed the ways in which the writer claimed Fitzgerald would be killed. Demonstrators, some of whom spent nights sleeping inside the Capitol rotunda in protest, had blocked entrances to the state legislature Thursday, chanting ""Let us in"" as police struggled to keep order. Lawmakers were later able to access the building through the one open entrance. Walker consistently defended the bill, which allows the state to avoid property tax increases and public-sector layoffs while trying to balance the budget. Senate Democrats called the bill an attack on worker rights, filing a complaint with the Dane County District Attorney's Office, claiming the Senate's vote violated Wisconsin's Open Meetings Law. GOP lawmakers say the bill's passage will help Wisconsin close a $137 million budget shortfall with a plan that requires public workers, with the exception of police and firefighters, to cover more of their retirement plan contributions and health care premiums. Raises would be tied to the rate of inflation, unless state voters approve an exception. The legislation also requires unions to hold a new certification vote every year, and unions would no longer be allowed to collect dues from workers' paychecks. Unions mobilized their supporters to oppose the bill, drawing tens of thousands of people to rallies opposing Walker and supporting the fugitive Democrats. By Thursday evening, at least one Democrat -- Sen. Jim Holperin -- had returned to his home state.","A bill curtailing the bargaining rights of most state workers is signed into law .

"(CNN)  -- Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has had an operation on his groin and will be out of action for four weeks, the English Premier League club confirmed on Friday. The England midfielder is thought to have sustained the injury during the February 6 victory at Chelsea, although he continued to play for the club until Sunday's 3-1 win over league leaders Manchester United. However, Gerrard did not travel to Portugal for Thursday's 1-0 defeat at Braga and will now miss the return leg of the Europa League last-16 tie at Anfield on March 17. ""Gerrard has undergone successful surgery on his groin and will be out for up to four weeks. The decision was made following consultation with a specialist,"" said a statement on Liverpool's official website. The 30-year-old will now miss at least three Premier League games, including upcoming trips to Sunderland and West Brom plus a home game against Manchester City. With Liverpool lying in sixth position in the table, the best manager Kenny Dalglish can hope for is that his skipper will have recovered in time for the club's last six league matches this season. Gerrard has also been ruled out of England's Euro 2012 qualifying match against Wales on March 26, as well as a friendly against Ghana. United will be without Nani for Saturday's FA Cup quarterfinal against Arsenal, with the influential Portugal winger expected to be sidelined for about three weeks after requiring stitches in the leg injury he suffered against Liverpool. ""We have managed to stitch it, which is great news,"" United manager Alex Ferguson told reporters. ""What we are guarding against is infection, but the swelling has gone down a great deal. ""It is very difficult to say when he will be back but we do have a two-week break after next Saturday. He will be ready for the return of that, that's for sure.""

"(RollingStone.com) -- When the Flaming Lips took the stage toward the end of the annual Tibet House benefit show at Carnegie Hall last night, there were none of the mirror balls or laser beams that typically end a Lips show -- but the band had a different surprise in store. After a stunning take on rarely played ""Soft Bulletin"" track ""Feeling You Disintegrate,"" frontman Wayne Coyne invited composer Philip Glass to the stage's grand piano. ""We've been rehearsing with him all day,"" Coyne said. ""And he's pretty f--ing cool."" The band kicked into a slow, hushed version of their classic ""Do You Realize?"", Coyne strumming his acoustic guitar, the body of which was connected to a green bubble. Late in the song, Glass took over with a spiraling piano line that vaguely hinted at the Lips' melody while guitarist Steven Drozd slowly added chilling touches of reverb. Coyne looked visibly moved and stopped playing entirely, closed his eyes and raised his fist, grinning. Rolling Stone: Exclusive performance: The Flaming Lips rehearse trippy version of 'Do You Realize?' ""Playing with him is how playing with Syd Barrett must have been,"" Coyne said after the performance, ""Changing something just as you're catching on. And that's exactly what you want."" This year marked the 61st anniversary of the 1950 Chinese invasion of Tibet, and the benefit -- which also featured Patti Smith, Michael Stipe, Taj Mahal and the Roots -- is in its 21st year. The show kicked off with several Tibetan monks in robes chanting in front of a large painting of the region's sprawling Potala Palace. The Roots were the first performers to bring the entire audience to their feet when they were joined by Angelique Kidjo for a rousing ""Move on Up."" Their peak was their take on Neil Young's ""Down by the River,"" a reprise from their Carnegie appearance last month at a Young tribute show. Guitarist Captain Kirk Douglas took center stage, wailing on his Gibson SG and throwing in riffs of ""Hey Joe"" under Young's lyrics. R.E.M. aren't touring off ""Collapse into Now"" (out March 8th), but Michael Stipe looked thrilled to be onstage. He debuted two never-performed R.E.M. songs: ""Saturn Return,"" off 2008's ""Reveal,"" which he performed standing behind the piano, and gorgeous new ""Collapse"" track ""Everyday is Yours to Win."" He told the crowd he had only played the song in bassist Mike Mills' living room in L.A. two weeks earlier, but it sounded like an R.E.M. classic. Rolling Stone: Michael Stipe discusses making ""Collapse into Now"" at rehearsal for Tibet House Benefit Concert . Last year, Iggy Pop made a scene stage diving into the relatively stiff Carnegie crowd as Smith watched from the side of the stage. This year, she gave the most aggressive performance, beginning with the Youngbloods' ""Get Together,"" which sounded like more of a plea than ever, and then kicked into an apocalyptic take on Buddy Holly's ""Not Fade Away."" Her band grooved on the raucous Bo Diddley beat while Smith gave an impassioned speech that proved she's been glued to the news lately. ""In Cairo and Wisconsin.... the people are taking to the streets, taking the power!"" she yelled. She also cited recent mysterious incidents -- thousands of blackbirds falling from the sky and dead fish washing up in Arkansas -- saying, ""Mother Nature is calling with such anguish. We must find a way to show love, because if you don't show love for Mother Nature, she will fucking take you down!"" Rolling Stone: Video: Watch Iggy Pop's final stage dive at Carnegie Hall . At the after party at New York's Gotham Hall, Coyne clutched he scarves he wore during his performance. He was still beaming from playing with Glass.

"(CNN) -- Highly-skilled foreign-born workers contribute more to the economy than they take away and unless the American government enacts immigration reform, the U.S. ""risks falling behing in the global race for talent,"" according to a report released Wednesday. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas on Wednesday released its 2010 annual report. Attached to the report was an essay authored by two economists who argue that that reform is needed to boost the legal immigration of highly-educated workers to the U.S. ""The disproportionate focus on illegal immigration is missing the picture that the legal system of immigration is broken as well,"" Federal Reserve senior economist Pia Orrenius told CNN. ""The cost of ignoring problems with the legal immigration of high-skilled workers in some respects is higher than the costs of illegal immigration."" Orrenius and Agnes Scott College economics professor Madeline Zavodny co-authored the essay, ""From Brawn to Brains."" The essay contains ideas included in a book the two economists co-authored for the American Enterprise Institute in 2010, Zavodny told CNN. The book is entitled ""Beside the Golden Door -- U.S. Immigration Reform in a New Era of Globalization."" Pointing to economic and census data, the authors say that skilled immigrants boost economic productivity and entrepreneurship. In highly technical fields, immigrants tend to complement U.S. born workers by moving into expanding fields ""where native labor supply cannot keep up,"" the author's Federal Reserve essay states. Immigrant entrepreneurs obtain patents at more than a two-to-one rate than native-born Americans, according to Orrenius and Zavodny, and tend to boost ""patent activity"" overall. More highly educated immigrants also contribute more to government coffers than lower-educated workers drain from them, according to Orrenius and Zavodny. The authors argue there is a line of approximately 1 million skilled-workers waiting on ""employment-based"" green cards from the U.S. government. That's because the number of permanent resident visas issued by the federal government hasn't changed since 1996. ""Untold numbers have given up on waiting or even applying,"" the essay states. ""For those in the queue, their applications have been approved, but their green cards won't be available for years because of strict numerical limits on employment-based permanent visas."" Orrenius and Zavodny also point out that U.S. policy on granting green-card status to immigrants overwhelmingly favors relatives of U.S. citizens, other legal residents or refugees. Employment-based green cards for skilled workers and their families account for 15% of the total issued by the U.S. government every year, according to the authors.","A report says immigration reform should boost numbers of highly-skilled foreign workers in U.S.

"(CNN) -- As ballots were being counted in Somaliland, a breakaway republic in northwest Somalia, officials said Sunday an observer from the electoral commission was killed. The former British colony held a presidential election Saturday. Voters lined up at polling stations under tight security; more than 1 million had registered to cast their ballots, according to Ise Yusuf Mohamed, chairman of the electoral commission. Mohamed said the polling was peaceful, but acknowledged small outbreaks of violence, including the killing of the observer Saturday near the town of Lasa Anod. The observer's identity and further details were not given. Mohamed warned the Somaliland people and the three political parties involved in the election not to celebrate results before they are officially declared. Security measures during the voting included a 12-hour ban on vehicles not carrying special permits, Mohamed said Saturday. Voters cast ballots under threats of violence from al-Shabaab, the primary Islamist group leading an insurgency in and around the capital city of Mogadishu in southern Somalia. In an audio message to local media, the group's leader, Sheik Mukhtar Abdirahman Abu Zubeyr -- himself a descendant of Somaliland -- called democracy ""the devil's principles"" and warned people in Somaliland not to adopt it. Al-Shabaab militants attacked Somaliland and the neighboring semi-autonomous region of Puntland with simultaneous suicide blasts in October 2008 that killed at least 24 people. In the election, current President Dahir Riyale Kahin of the ruling party UDUD is opposed by two other candidates. The northwestern region of Somaliland achieved independence from Britain on June 26, 1960, followed by the rest of Somalia, which became independent of Italy five days later on July 1, 1960, and joined Somaliland to form the state . of Somalia. After the fall of Somali dictator Siad Barre in 1991, Somaliland declared its separation from Somalia, according to the CIA World Factbook. Somaliland has yet to receive international diplomatic recognition as a state but has achieved a level of security and stability unmatched in the rest of Somalia. Southern Somalia has not seen a stable government since the fall of the dictatorship and has been mired in civil war since its fall. The ongoing conflict has resulted in ""an unprecedented humanitarian crisis,"" according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.

"(CNN) -- Germany's Martin Kaymer has been speaking about his rise to the top of the world golf rankings, despite losing the WGC-Accenture Match Play final to Luke Donald at the weekend. The 26-year-old from Dusseldorf takes over as world number one from Lee Westwood, almost 25 years to the month since Bernhard Langer became the first player -- and only other German -- to head the newly-created rankings in April 1986. Kaymer told the official European Tour website: ""I definitely need some time to think about it and let it sink in. ""The good thing is next week I don't have a tournament, so maybe then I'll be able to appreciate what I've done. ""What I can say for sure is that it's an incredibly proud moment. Not only for me, but also for my family, for the people who have helped me, and obviously for Germany. ""To be only the second German after Bernhard Langer, who was my role model when I was growing up, is a very special feeling. Kaymer continued: ""When the ranking is published I'm definitely going to take a picture with my name at the top. It doesn't feel real to me at the moment, but maybe when I see it in writing then I'll start to believe I'm the best golfer in the world. ""Not many people can say they're the best player in the world at their sport, so I feel very honored and privileged."" Kaymer only turned professional in 2005, but his rapid rise to the top has been phenomenal. Since winning his first European Tour tournament in Abu Dhabi in January 2008, Kaymer has gone on to lift eight more professional titles, including his first major success -- the 2010 U.S. PGA at Whistling Straits -- and two more victories in Abu Dhabi. He also played a key role in Europe winning the Ryder Cup at Celtic Manor last year and won the 2010 Race to Dubai as Europe's leading golfer. Kaymer becomes only the 14th player, and sixth European, to become world number one and is the second youngest, behind Tiger Woods, to hold the honor.","Martin Kaymer has been speaking about his rise to the top of the world golf rankings .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Under pressure from ongoing protests against his government, Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh pledged Thursday to bring a new constitution to a vote by the end of the year and transfer government power to an elected parliamentary system. ""We have communicated the demands of all the youth demonstrators to the government because they are the future, and the government will fulfill all their demands without strikes, clashes, or chaos,"" Saleh said in a nationally broadcast speech. The president's plan also called for the creation of a unity government to review new election laws. Saleh, who has refused to step down, has said he will not run again for the presidency in the next election. He has ruled Yemen for 32 years. Mohammed Qahtan, spokesman for the opposition coalition Joint Meeting Parties, dismissed Saleh's initiative. ""It's like someone trying to score a goal from behind the net,"" he said. ""Whatever he does is useless."" Human rights advocate Khaled Al-Anesi said the government's moves were too late. ""Yemenis will not accept what the president said today,"" he said. ""Too many protesters have died and the president is treating this and talking about all this like a storm that will pass. ""People will continue to protest and more and more will continue to demand his resignation and we won't stop until he is forced to leave office,"" he said. The Yemeni Embassy in Washington issued a statement expressing the government's disappointment with the opposition's rejection of Saleh's ""initiative aimed at political and national reconciliation."" Protests that erupted in Yemen early last month have left at least 30 people dead, according to Amnesty International. The human rights monitoring group urged Yemeni authorities to put an end to ""deadly night raids and other attacks on protests."" Human Rights Watch, meanwhile, called on authorities to immediately investigate the apparent killing of two protesters by soldiers during a March 4 protest near the town of Harf Sufyan. ""We have credible allegations that thousands of peaceful protesters faced live fire by Yemen's military outside Harf Sufyan and that two unarmed civilians paid with their lives,"" said Joe Stork, the organization's deputy Middle East director. A medical official said a Yemeni man injured in protests Tuesday at Sanaa University died of his wounds. Yaser Al-Hasani, one of the demonstrators, said security forces cracked down after students defied their orders not to take food and blankets into the protest area outside the gates of the university. The supplies were intended for the thousands of anti-government demonstrators who have camped out calling for Saleh to step down. Mohamed Ali Mutlak, 24, was among dozens of anti-government demonstrators wounded when security forces fired into the air and shot tear gas into a crowd of tens of thousands of protesters who had massed in front of Sanaa University, witnesses said. Mohammed Abulahoum, a senior government official, condemned the force used by police and the military. ""There was no need for that force. This will only escalate the tension between both sides,"" he said Wednesday. Yemen's anti-government demonstrations are unfolding in a nation wracked by a Shiite Muslim uprising, a U.S.-aided crackdown on al Qaeda operatives and a looming shortage of water. Yemeni journalists covering their nation's unrest have voiced concern about threats and abuses against them, especially those who are working for foreign media outlets. A police officer in Sanaa physically assaulted Al-Arabiya correspondent Jamal Noman as he covered a sanitation workers' strike in the capital on Monday, a local journalist told the Committee to Protect Journalists. The police officer also tried, but failed, to confiscate Noman's camera. The next day, Al-Jazeera correspondent Ahmad al-Shalafi was threatened on the phone. One caller said his children would be kidnapped if he continued his critical reporting, the committee reported. The threat came after al-Shalafi's coverage of a prison protest. Two other Al-Jazeera journalists have received similar threats. The committee urged Yemeni authorities to investigate.

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of Somalis marched through the streets of Mogadishu, Somalia, on Monday, protesting against Al-Shabaab militants. The protesters -- mostly women and children, along with traditional warriors wearing white clothes and armed with spears and wooden shields -- chanted slogans denouncing the al Qaeda-inspired group. It was only the nation's second public demonstration against Al-Shabaab, which controls much of southern Somalia. It came a few days after the militant group destroyed tombs of revered Sufi clerics. The demonstration was staged in a government-controlled area of the city and was guarded by government forces, according to Yusuf Mohamed, who works for Shabelle Radio in Mogadishu. ""People were really disturbed by the move of Al-Shabaab to destroy the tombs of the revered sheikhs of Ahlu Sunna"" said Mohyadin Hassan Afrah, who leads a civil society umbrella group in Mogadishu. The protesters shouted slogans of support for the U.N.-backed government, observers said. Al-Shabaab follows the strict Saudi Arabian-inspired Wahhabi interpretation of Islam, rather than the Sufi Islam of many Somalis. ""We call for a holy war against them,"" said Sheikh Abdulkadir Somow, from the Sufi Ahlu Sunnah Wal Jama group, which recently signed a deal with the government in neighboring Ethiopia. Some of the demonstrators carried posters with slogan such as ""Down and defeat to Al-Shabaab,"" observers said. They also carried slogans to support the transitional government such as ""Support Peace and Government."" Last year, nearly 100 students came out in anger to the streets of Mogadishu in protest of Al-Shabaab after a suicide bomber detonated his explosives in a graduation ceremony in the capital, killing more than 20 people, including four government ministers, doctors, teachers, students and journalists.","Hundreds of Somalis chanted slogans denouncing the al Qaeda-inspired group .

"(CNN) -- An emerging commercial space race just got more intense. ATK, Alliant Techsystems, has for 30 years built space shuttle booster rockets at its plant in Promontory, Utah.  The company has just announced it plans to build a rocket to take astronauts to the international space station. ATK says it will offer NASA launch services to the station using a new rocket called Liberty.  Kent Rominger, former space shuttle astronaut and now ATK's program manager for Liberty, said, ""We will be the safest vehicle on the street to carry a crew."" The entrance of ATK into the commercial crew arena clearly signals an intense fight for NASA dollars and contracts to fly crews to the space station. Is this now a commercial space race?  ""Absolutely yes,"" Rominger said. Elon Musk, the multimillionaire head of Space X, has already been awarded a NASA contract to begin flying cargo to the station within a year using his Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule.  Musk has said Space X can start flying astronauts in Dragon by 2015. ATK said its rocket will be ready to fly that same year.  Rominger said he believes Liberty is instantly way ahead in the race, because much of the rocket is already rated for humans. Rominger said of Musk, ""When it comes to flying humans, he's never demonstrated anything close to that capability.""  Space X says it welcomes the competition. ""The American-made Falcon 9 launch vehicle and Dragon Spacecraft were designed from the start to be the safest, most reliable and economical vehicle to carry crews into space,"" said Ken Bowersox, a former astronaut and now vice president of Space X.  ""We will meet NASA'S certification requirements."" Space X says its Dragon spacecraft will deliver seven astronauts to the station for $140 million.  ATK's $180 million price tag does not include the cost of a crew capsule. But Rominger says Liberty will have twice the payload capacity of Musk's Falcon rocket. The new rocket is a partnership between ATK and Astrium, a company that builds the Ariane 5 launcher for the European Space Agency. The Liberty rocket would stand some 300 feet tall.  It is being designed, ATK said, so any crew capsule NASA chooses could fly on it. The Space X vehicle is the complete package, both rocket and capsule.  ATK will build a five-segment solid rocket booster, which is larger than a shuttle booster.  Astrium will provide a liquid fueled upper stage. ATK officials said their rocket will provide NASA tremendous value because they will assemble Liberty in the Vehicle Assembly Building at the Kennedy Space Center and launch from one of the existing space shuttle launchpads.","ATK announces plans for rocket to take astronauts to space station .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama's spokesman criticized the Egyptian government on Tuesday for arresting and harassing journalists and rights activists, and called comments by Vice President Omar Suleiman that Egypt is not ready for democracy ""particularly unhelpful."" The remarks by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs reflected a growing U.S. dissatisfaction with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Suleiman, the intelligence officer Mubarak chose as his deputy to bring about reforms demanded by protesters who have convulsed Cairo and the Egyptian economy for more than two weeks. In another sign of U.S. frustration with the pace of reform in Egypt, Vice President Joe Biden, in a phone call Tuesday with Suleiman, pushed for more progress, according to a White House statement. Biden urged ""that the transition produce immediate, irreversible progress that responds to the aspirations of the Egyptian people,"" according to the White House statement. It said the two vice presidents discussed ""restraining the Ministry of Interior's conduct by immediately ending the arrests, harassment, beating and detention of journalists, and political and civil society activists, and by allowing freedom of assembly and expression; immediately rescinding the emergency law; broadening participation in the national dialogue to include a wide range of opposition members; and inviting the opposition as a partner in jointly developing a road map and timetable for transition."" ""These steps, and a clear policy of no reprisals, are what the broad opposition is calling for and what the government is saying it is prepared to accept,"" the statement said. ""Vice President Biden expressed the belief that the demands of the broad opposition can be met through meaningful negotiations with the government."" A senior administration official told CNN on condition of not being identified that the Egyptian government was ""doing the kinds of things that need to be done, but they have to now deliver and Biden outlined some specific things that will demonstrate that they're delivering."" The essential question, according to the official, was whether Egyptian leaders were ""truly willing to cede power to somebody else."" ""Are they truly going to deliver change or are they trying to put a veneer on this process and finesse the next few months without actually delivering change?"" the official added. ""There's a sense that the government can wait out the protesters. But then what? We're confident the protesters are not going away."" The Egyptian government's dilemma is ""that the longer this goes on, there's an economic impact that Egypt can't afford,"" the official said. So far, the Obama administration has been careful to call for democratic reforms in Egypt while also trying to maintain stability in a key Middle Eastern ally that is a vital Arab partner to Israel through the Camp David Accords of 1978. With detentions, beatings and harassment of journalists and rights activists continuing, and the weekend comments by Suleiman that signaled a shaky commitment to the reforms offered by Mubarak, Gibbs made a point of directly criticizing both the vice president and the Egyptian government in a briefing with White House reporters. ""The government has got to stop arresting protesters and journalists, harassment, beatings, detentions of reporters, of activists, of those involved in civil society,"" Gibbs said. Previously, he and other U.S. officials, including Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, called for a halt to the crackdown on journalists and activists without directly saying that the Egyptian government was responsible. Asked about Suleiman's comment, made in an interview with ABC, that Egypt lacks the necessary ""culture of democracy"" for the changes demanded by protesters, such as freedom of speech and the right to organize opposition parties, Gibbs said the words went against what was happening on the streets of Cairo and elsewhere in Egypt. ""Vice President Suleiman made some particularly unhelpful comments about Egypt not being ready for democracy,"" Gibbs said, adding, ""I don't think that in any way squares with what those seeking greater opportunity and freedom think is a timetable for progress."" Gibbs also took exception to Suleiman's insistence that foreign elements, including Islamists, are behind or motivating the protesters in Egypt. ""I think the rhetoric that we see coming out now that simply says that somehow what you see on TV has been drummed up by foreigners is at great odds with what we know is actually happening,"" Gibbs said. Another senior administration official, speaking with CNN on condition of not being identified because of the sensitivity of a rapidly changing political situation in Cairo, acknowledged that ""there is some sort of level of frustration here."" ""We don't want just talking,"" the official said. ""We want it to lead to something concrete."" While there is no U.S. timetable of steps being pushed, the official said, ""we continue to stress to both sides that negotiations and dialogue have to be inclusive and broad because we do recognize that there's not just three or four viewpoints; it encompasses a wide range of views in society ... that need to be fully represented in negotiations and discussions."" Gibbs repeated the U.S. call for an orderly transition in Egypt from the repressive rule of the past three decades under Mubarak to a multiparty democracy through free and fair elections. Mubarak has insisted he will remain in power through the end of his term in September instead of ceding to demands for his immediate ouster by the protesters and opposition figures. Suleiman also says Mubarak must remain in power until the next election for the transition to be orderly. Suleiman met Sunday with some Egyptian opposition figures in preliminary talks that symbolized concession on both sides. Some opposition figures had rejected any discussions until Mubarak stepped down, while a government statement issued on state TV after Sunday's meeting outlined future steps resulting from the meeting. In a brief informal exchange with reporters on Monday, Obama said: ""Obviously Egypt has to negotiate a path and I think they are making progress."" Gibbs said Tuesday that the talk of reform must be followed by meaningful action, or the protests on the streets would continue. ""I think that the people that are expressing their desire for greater opportunity and freedom are going to continue to express that desire until the government takes the very concrete steps that I outlined a minute ago to address those concerns,"" Gibbs said. ""And if they don't, then those protests will, I assume, continue."" CNN's Jill Dougherty contributed to this story.","NEW: A U.S. source says there is frustration with Egypt's government .

""The only thing that saves him, of course, is that there doesn't seem to be anybody to run against him next year,"" Conyers said. After naming prospective challengers Sarah Palin and Newt Gingrich, among others, Conyers said he still supports Obama because ""the alternative is unthinkable. I just want to make him a better president."" American foreign policy was among the areas the Michigan congressman criticized for what he consider an emphasis on military might over other ways to achieve U.S. goals. Conyers said, ""It is kind of amazing to me that there is still adopted, even in this administration, the attitude that military prowess will settle things down. And they rarely, if ever, do."" He also responded to a question about the recent departure of a ranking State Department official who was critical of how the Pentagon is reportedly treating U.S. Army Pvt. Bradley Manning, a soldier suspected of a role in the WikiLeaks scandal. ""I was not in agreement again with the president saying that he's told Manning's been treated -- his confinement is okay, that he's told everything is alright. I don't think it's all right.""

"Sakura, Japan (CNN) -- Residents of northern Japan streamed south from their earthquake-stricken hometowns Saturday, crowding stores in search of vital supplies as rescue teams worked north toward the historic quake's epicenter. Roads and buildings showed cracks as far away as 200 kilometers (125 miles) from Sendai, the closest city to the epicenter. One man told CNN the scene in towns hit by the quake and the resulting tsunami was ""unimaginable."" Shoppers were polite but tense as they sought food, water and gasoline from stores, where shelves were quickly emptied and pumps soon ran dry. A slow, steady line of cars trickled south from the disaster zone as people either left the area or shuttled to the stores, many of which were without power and had broken glass scattered down the aisles. Japan's major highways, large sections of which are elevated, have been closed since the magnitude 8.9-quake struck off the northeastern coast Friday afternoon. Automobile traffic crawled on smaller, two-lane roads as power outages left the sleek, electric-powered ""bullet trains"" -- shining examples of Japan's advanced technology, usually capable of speeds nearing 200 mph -- sitting motionless on their tracks. Closer to the heart of the disaster, collapsed phone lines and towers left communications spotty. Roads and airfields were washed out by the tsunami; rescue workers headed to the stricken region had to rely on helicopters. Video from Sendai showed people trapped in the second floors of homes, waving sheets of white cloth in hopes of drawing rescue workers. Residents who have been able to call out reported gas and water were unavailable for a radius well beyond the city of about 1 million. In Minamisoma, a city about 90 kilometers (56 miles) south of Sendai, all that was left of many structures were their foundations. Only concrete and steel buildings appeared to have withstood the wash. No people were visible in the streets of the town, whose population on Friday had been 70,000. The quake and resulting tsunami left behind hundreds dead by early Saturday, and that number was expected to climb sharply. Tokyo, about 370 kilometers (230 miles) from the epicenter, was spared major damage from the quake. But power outages and highway closures paralyzed the city as its transit network was shut down. Commuters who usually pack the city's subways and suburban trains in the city of 13 million tried to flag down taxis, hitch rides or walk home. The roads leading out of Tokyo were clogged by traffic jams that trapped some drivers for up to six hours. CNN's Paula Hancocks contributed to this report.","Stocks of food, water and gasoline are running thin in the quake zone .

"(CNN) -- An Iranian-style theocratic regime in turbulent Egypt would be a nightmare for Washington and a dream for Tehran, but it's a no-go scenario for some scholars of the Middle East. Some analysts doubt this vision because the Muslim Brotherhood -- the outlawed but popular militant Sunni Islamist opposition movement in Egypt -- appears to lack the clout and widespread support to seize power at present. Experts also say the movement is less extreme than the hardline clerics who rule Iran. One analyst said the Egyptian military appears to be trying to reconsolidate its power and maintain what has been a ""military dictatorship in civilian garb."" Just Friday, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei praised the North African uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia and said they echo his country's revolution. There is an easy parallel between the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran that toppled the shah and the current uprising in Egypt: Both reflected popular discontent across the societies over hated and autocratic rule. But other political factors deflate this scenario, analysts say. Michael Singh, visiting fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said that first and foremost, there is no figure in the Muslim Brotherhood who is equivalent to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Shiite cleric who led the toppling of the Iranian government. ""The Muslim Brotherhood is taking, so far, kind of a back seat,"" he said of its role in Egypt, which is predominantly Sunni. ""They are late to the game."" Isobel Coleman, a senior fellow for U.S. foreign policy at the Council for Foreign Relations, agrees that there is no ""charismatic and identifiable leader"" of an Islamic opposition. Khomeini, she said, was ""such a threat"" that he had been exiled to France. Singh said that when Khomeini was in Paris, he said he didn't want to establish an Islamic republic, but that turned out to be a lie. Coleman said the Iranian regime led by Khomeini murderously repressed and sold down the river many in the opposition who supported the uprising in the 1970s. ""The specter of that is very frightening to many Egyptians,"" she said. ""Egyptians are very nervous about repeating what happened in Iran."" Mustafa Alani, director of the security and defense studies at the Dubai-based Gulf Research Center, sees the Muslim Brotherhood as a moderate force compared with a movement like al Qaeda. He points to Jordan, where the new government has reached out to the Brotherhood's political wing, and envisions the group having a public role to play in a new Egypt. At the same time, he doubts the Brotherhood would have influence over the army, and thinks the military would not allow them to seize power. ""I don't think it's a realistic assumption that they will seize power,"" he said. Haim Malka, deputy director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic & International Studies, wrote in a commentary Friday that the ""Egyptian military faces a range of challenges that defy easy resolution"" and the ""debate over the future role of the Muslim Brotherhood is a prime example."" ""No representative system can take root in Egypt without the Brotherhood's participation. But, after spending the last half century battling Islamist political forces, the military leadership will have trouble overcoming its deep disdain for the Brotherhood,"" Malka said. Singh points out that there's an impression among observers that the next Egypt will probably have a more anti-Western government and that the opposition leaders who will find their way into government could be less hospitable to U.S. interests. In contrast, he said, there's not much fear of an Iranian-style theocracy at the moment. He said Iran hasn't succeeded in exporting its revolution. Its neighbor Iraq, which like Iran is majority Shiite, hasn't evolved into a theocracy. Coleman said Egyptians are wary of extremism and fear succumbing to the violence that raged last decade in Iraq. Also, the army plays a more moderating role. She said one big difference between Iran and Egypt are their economies. Iran has a lot of oil, and it can afford to be ""more reactionary and revolutionary."" Egypt is dependent on tourism, shipping through the Suez Canal and trade with neighboring countries. ""These types of things bind it to more moderate policies,"" Coleman said. The calculation made by subsequently assassinated President Anwar Sadat in the 1970s to forge peace with Israel reflects this moderation. Coleman said it has been a ""cold peace"" between Israel and Egypt, but leaders have concluded it serves Egypt better than conflict, instability and failure. Singh says Sadat's ""bold and risky move"" was made to stop the endless state of war that began in the 1940s and help create prosperity. Because of Egyptian repression, there are uncertainties about the Muslim Brotherhood. Singh said it's unclear to what extent and why people have supported the Muslim Brotherhood in the past. Is that because it opposed Mubarak? Or is that because people philosophically support the group. ""I don't think we know right now,"" he said. Could there be a future autocracy in Egypt, even if it doesn't resemble Iran's theocratic regime? CNN's Fareed Zakaria, the foreign affairs expert who hosts an hour-long Sunday show on world affairs, says the military seems to have made a decision to try to maintain and reconsolidate power and it will sacrifice anyone to do that, even Hosni Mubarak. He said it could be a ""very unsatisfactory outcome."" ""What is clear over the last three days is that they caused chaos and are now going to step in to restore order,"" he said of Egypt's military. If that cycle plays out, he says, ""the entire movement will have been in vain.""","The Iran template doesn't apply to Egypt, analysts say .

Crisis mappers wasted no time responding: In under 2.5 hours Google launched its person finder application, which was also used when New Zealand's 6.3 quake struck last month, and a local developer in Tokyo, Shu Sigashi, a member of the OpenStreetMap Foundation in Japan, quickly put up a localized Ushahidi crisis platform. Crisis mapping's reach only goes as far as it is utilized, so the key now is getting the word out that online tools are available to help report the missing. Google's person finder app is already rapidly increasing in usage. Within a couple hours 2,000 reports had been logged. If you type in the name, ""Yoshi,"" in Google's app, results come up that indicate whether people with that name have been reported as alive or missing. Hawaii's Pacific Disaster Center has updated tsunami warnings and an interactive map with information on the risks present on each island. The UN satellite monitoring group that teamed up with Google and George Clooney in Sudan could also be activated at the request of the Japanese government at any moment. ""We're on standby basically,"" UNOSAT's Lars Bromley tells Fast Company. ""The Japanese have a very good disaster satellite monitoring program run out of their space agency (JAXA).

"(CNN) -- Javier Zanetti equaled Inter Milan's Serie A appearance record as the Italian champions continued their revival under new coach Leonardo with a 4-1 win over Bologna on Saturday. The 37-year-old midfielder matched the mark of 519 league games set by Giuseppe Bergomi in 1999, having passed 700 in all competitions in the black and blue of the Nerazzuri in May's Champions League final win over Bayern Munich. He will have the record to himself if he plays in Wednesday's home match against Cesena. ""There is no end to the positive things to say about Zanetti, he is a wonderful athlete and human being. He was my first signing,"" said Inter president Massimo Moratti, who brought the former Argentina international to the San Siro in 1995. But it was one of the club's more recent signings who inspired a win which lifted Inter into fourth above Roma on goal difference and eight points adrift of leaders AC Milan, who travel to Lecce on Sunday night. Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o set up Dejan Stankovic's 20th-minute opener and scored a second-half double to take his tally to 23 for the season in just 26 games in all competitions. Stankovic provided a perfect throughball that allowed Diego Milito to score the second goal on the half-hour, with the Argentine having headed against the near post early in the match. Milito's clever backheel provided Eto'o with a one-two into the area in the 63rd minute and the former Barcelona star slotted home a right-foot effort. The four-time African player of the year made it 4-0 with 19 minutes to play as he curled in a freekick, while Henry Gimenez scored a consolation six minutes later for the visitors -- who remained in 15th place after being penalized three points earlier this week for infringing rules over tax and player payments. It was the fourth successive victory for Brazilian Leonardo, who replaced the sacked Rafael Benitez last month. Second-placed Napoli could have closed to within a point of Leonardo's former club Milan with victory at home to mid-table Fiorentina, but ended up being held to a frustrating goalless draw. It was a disappointing result following last weekend's 3-0 win over Juventus.","Javier Zanetti makes his 519th Italian league appearance for Inter Milan .

"(CNN) -- The judge in the sodomy trial of Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim handed him a key victory Tuesday when he ruled that DNA taken from items Anwar used in his police jail cell is inadmissible. Authorities had hoped to swipe DNA taken from a toothbrush, water bottle and hand towel in Anwar's cell -- and compare it with the DNA recovered from semen left in his accuser's body. ""None of their witnesses gave evidence that Anwar drank from the bottle of water or used the towel or toothbrush,"" said defense lawyer Sankara Nair. ""The items were taken from the police cell and anybody could have used them. So the evidence was lacking from the start."" ""If the prosecutors can't link Anwar's DNA to the boy's body semen, which is the main crux of the case, then they don't have a case,"" she added. ""So that's why we feel a big chunk of the case is gone."" Sodomy, even if consensual, is punishable by 20 years in prison in the majority-Muslim country. Anwar has pleaded not guilty to the charge. Investigators arrested Anwar in July 2008 -- four months after a loose coalition of opposition parties he led made gains on the ruling party in parliamentary elections. ""I don't believe that I'm going to get a fair trial,"" Anwar told CNN in February 2010. ""A fair trial would require a competent, independent judge to immediately strike out the charge because any sexual assault must have a case to support the charge."" Anwar has called his arrest a ""dirty trick and conspiracy"" orchestrated by authorities who are trying to discredit him. ""They think that by doing this they can frustrate the opposition because they think the coalition will be more fragile without me,"" said Anwar, who oversees a multiethnic opposition alliance and his own Justice Party. ""Clearly they have underestimated the commitment of the (parties)."" The U.S. State Department has said that Anwar's arrest ""raises serious questions and concerns."" Anwar was the heir apparent to former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad until 1998, when he was sacked and charged for corruption and sodomy. Anwar spent six years in prison after being convicted on corruption charges in 1999 and on sodomy charges involving his wife's former driver in 2000. Malaysia's highest court overturned the sodomy conviction and ordered him released from prison in 2004. However, the corruption verdict was never lifted, barring him from running for political posts until 2008. A loose coalition of opposition parties -- with Anwar at the helm -- won 82 of 222 parliamentary seats in elections in March of that year. It was the second time in the country's history that the ruling party failed to gain the two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution. Anwar has said the investigators trying to build a case against him are the same ones who hid evidence that could have cleared him in his sodomy-related conviction in 1999.","Authorities had hoped to compare the DNA to that taken from the victim .
The main crux of the prosecution's case was the DNA, defense says .

"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- It was a day and an event like so many others -- until it wasn't. Six people were killed and 12 others wounded, including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, when a gunman opened fire in front of a Safeway supermarket in Tucson, Arizona, authorities said. The congresswoman had been hosting a meeting with constituents Saturday morning when the attack began. Dr. Steven Rayle told CNN's Wolf Blitzer he was about 10 feet away from Giffords when the gunman shot the congresswoman. ""He continued to fire, sort of rapidly, really at point-blank range. And the way things were set up, people really had no route to escape. They were sort of hemmed in by the architecture and the things around there,"" he said. After a moment of hesitation, Rayle said he ducked behind a concrete post, then laid on the ground so as not to be a target. Rayle said the suspect ""had a sort of determined look on his face"" as he opened fire. ""He was not sort of going around and picking out people and firing at them ... He was just firing his gun indiscriminately,"" he said. The 22-year-old suspect, who law enforcement sources identified as Jared Lee Loughner, was trying to reload when he was tackled to the ground, another witness said. The gun, which another bystander had wrestled from the gunman, was empty and cocked open. The shooter had another magazine at the ready, Joe Zamudio told CNN. ""He was ready for war. He was not playing around,"" Zamudio said. ""He was going to keep shooting. It was not over. He had just ran out of bullets."" Zamudio said he was one of the bystanders who pinned the gunman to the ground until police showed up. Jason Pekau, who works at a nearby store, said he heard the gunshots from 50 yards away. ""It sounded like tons of pots and pans falling down on the ground right next to my ear it was so loud,"" he said. He described a chaotic scene in the parking lot immediately after the attack. ""I just saw people running, screaming towards where the shooting happened. Everyone screaming that it was Gabrielle Giffords,"" he said. Witnesses told him she was shot ""point-blank in the head,"" Farley said. ""I did see them take her away on a stretcher,"" Pekau said about the congresswoman. ""She was moving, from what I saw with my own eyes."" Giffords may owe her survival to a quick-thinking intern, an Arizona state legislator told CNN. Arizona state Rep. Steve Farley said Daniel Hernandez, his former campaign manager -- and a trained nurse -- was interning for Giffords and staffing Saturday's meet-and-greet event. ""He said that when he was in the back ... he heard shots in the front. He rushed to see what had happened. Gabby was on the floor,"" Farley said. ""He was able to use his nurse training and snapped right into it and was able to apply pressure to the wound and keep her active and alert. He rode with her in the ambulance to the hospital."" Video from the scene showed one of Giffords' banners still hanging in the storefront. Yellow tape was draped around the parking lot as police began their investigation. Giffords won her third term in a closely contested race against a Tea Party-sponsored candidate and was one of three Democratic legislators who reported vandalism at their offices following the March vote on health care reform. President Barack Obama spoke from Washington soon after the attack. He called it a national tragedy and underlined how simply the day began -- like any other. ""It's not surprising that today, Gabby was doing what she was always does -- listening to the hopes and concerns of her neighbors,"" said Obama, referring to the congresswoman by her nickname. ""That is the essence of what our democracy is all about.""","NEW: ""He was ready for war. He was not playing around,"" one witness says .

"(CNN) -- Actress Felicia ""Snoop"" Pearson, who once dealt drugs in Baltimore before a chance encounter got her a role on HBO's ""The Wire,"" was arrested overnight during a series of raids in her hometown, police said Thursday. A five-month drug trafficking investigation, dubbed ""Public Enemies,"" focused on heroin and marijuana distribution. It targeted 79 people; 63 were arrested in the raids, according to CNN Baltimore affiliate WBAL. The U.S. Attorney's Office said 24 people face drug charges at the federal level, and 40 more face similar charges at the state level, including Pearson. A federal indictment alleges that the conspirators mainly obtained heroin and marijuana from suppliers in New York and California. She was arrested on a charge of conspiracy to distribute heroin and aiding and abetting, prosecutors said in a statement. WBAL said it got no reply when it asked Pearson for a comment. ""It's named 'Public Enemies' because a lot of the main targets are violent repeat offenders,"" said Carl Kotowski of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in Baltimore. ""Allegedly, they've been tied to a few murders in the city.""

"(CNN)  -- A Wayne Rooney inspired Manchester United beat arch-rivals Arsenal 2-0 at Old Trafford Saturday to reach the semifinals of the English FA Cup. Rooney was involved in the brilliant build-up to United's opener for Fabio da Silva in the 28th minute and scored early in the second half to clinch his side's passage. The victory leaves the Red Devils on course for the domestic double, topping the English Premier League despite successive defeats to Chelsea and Liverpool and favorites to land the oldest cup competition in the world. They play Marseille on Tuesday bidding to reach the last eight of the Champions League with the first leg drawn 0-0. Earlier, United's north-west neighbors Bolton won 3-2 at Birmingham to make the last four. Lee Chung-Yong headed a 90th winner after Owen Coyle's side had been pegged back to 2-2 by a late equalizer from veteran home striker Kevin Phillips. Bolton had taken the lead through Johan Elmander's fine finish in the 21st minute before Cameron Jerome scored Birmingham's first equalizer in the 38th minute. Kevin Davies converted a 66th-minute penalty to put Bolton ahead again only for Phillips to strike in the 80th minute. Birmingham were looking for the domestic cup double after beating Arsenal in the League Cup final two weeks ago. That Wembley defeat was the start of a difficult spell for Arsenal, who were beaten by Barcelona in midweek to end their Champions League hopes. United also went into the heavyweight cup clash on a poor run and Ferguson responded by making several changes and including seven defensive players in his line-up. But it paid off and one of them, Fabio, was on hand to knock home the loose ball after a Javier Hernandez header from a Wayne Rooney cross was only parried out by Manuel Almunia. Rooney's goal in the 49th minute gave them a two-goal cushion which was needed as Edwin van der Sar made a series of excellent stops to deny Arsenal a route back into the tie. Substitute Paul Scholes played a sublime pass to hand Rooney a great chance for a second in injury time, which he spurned, but was fortunate to stay on the field after receiving a yellow card and then tangling with Samir Nasri in an ugly incident. Dutch veteran van der Sar was delighted by the victory in his farewell season. ""We got our goals, luckily I pulled off a couple of saves and we defended well,"" he told ITV Sport. ""It was important of course because we lost to Chelsea and Liverpool so the gap in the league is now non-existent.""

"Rio De Janeiro, Brazil (CNN) -- Violence including clashes between police and drug gangs in the slums of Rio de Janeiro has killed 23 people since Sunday, with 188 people arrested or detained so far, military police said Thursday. It was not immediately clear whether all the dead were gang members or whether civilians and police were among the fatalities. The continuing unrest stems from the transfer of prisoners from local institutions to federal lockups in other states, the government-run Agencia Brasil news outlet reported, citing Rio de Janeiro Public Security Secretary Jose Mariano Beltrame. Some of the prisoners being transferred ordered the violence by drug gangs, Beltrame said. Also factoring into the situation was a police effort to remove some drug gang members from Rio's crime-ridden slums, called favelas. According to the military police, two police officers have been hurt in the unrest, with 66 people arrested and 122 others detained. In addition, 37 vehicles have been torched: 27 cars, two vans, seven buses and a truck, the military police reported. Earlier, officials said the drug gangs also shot up a police station. At least 47 public schools and 10 nurseries suspended classes Thursday, Agencia Brasil reported. Beltrame said two rival gangs joined forces to launch the attacks. The security chief also said he mobilized all police in the city to try to restore order and to step up police presence in 17 of Rio's slums. Agencia Brasil reported that the nation's Army was on high alert but had not been called in to bolster police efforts. The news agency also said Brazil's Marine Corps sent armored vehicles, weapons, ammunition and night-vision goggles for use by Rio de Janeiro security forces at the request of Rio de Janeiro State Gov. Sergio Cabral. On Tuesday, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva told CNN affiliate TV Record that he had instructed his justice minister ""to attend to Rio de Janeiro with whatever he needs."" Officials are concerned about crime in Brazil as the nation prepares to host the 2014 World Cup soccer tournament and the 2016 Summer Olympics, which will be held in Rio.

"Moscow (CNN) -- Chechen rebel leader Doku Umarov claimed responsibility Monday for last month's deadly attack on Moscow's main international airport that left 36 people dead. In a video message, posted on a website that regularly carries messages from Chechen rebels, Umarov said he was speaking on January 24 -- the day of the deadly bombing. He wore camouflage combat fatigues and a black skullcap. ""The special operation was done in accordance with my order. Similar special operations will be taking place in the future,"" he said in Russian. The Kavkaz Center website said it received the message and posted it late Monday. In a seperate message posted over the weekend, the self-titled Emir of the North Caucasus vowed to deliver ""a year of blood and tears"" to Russia, saying that there were dozens of rebels prepared to carry out attacks. ""I won't tell you there are hundreds of us prepared for jihad. But 50 or 60, God willing, we will find,"" said Umarov. ""Those operations will be conducted monthly or weekly, as Allah allows us,"" he said. In Moscow, investigators say they have identified the suspected suicide bomber behind the airport attack as a 20-year-old man from the North Caucusus region. Alexander Bortnikov, the head of Russia's Federal Security Service, has refused to publicly name the suspect or identify his specific origin. But he told Russian state television the alleged bomber was under the influence of drugs before the attack. ""Biological studies revealed the presence of a huge amount of highly potent narcotic and psychotropic substances in parts of the suicide bomber's body,"" Bortnikov said. Sitting beneath a black flag and flanked by two other bearded rebels in the message posted first, Umarov names the young man to his left as ""Mujahedeen Seifullah."" He said the man was being sent on a mission, although it is not clear from the video if this was the suspected Moscow airport bomber, or when the message was recorded. ""I would like Putin and Medvedev and all other kaffirs and enemies to understand that there are many of us who will follow in our footsteps and give their lives for Allah,"" Umarov said.","NEW: Doku Umarov says he directed the January 24 airport bombing .

"(CNN) -- With its $315 million purchase of The Huffington Post this week, a company best known for distributing free CDs has succeeded where mainstream media outlets failed: Spotting the potential of one of the Web's fastest growing media brands. AOL, widely thought to be the imminent victim of a dying Internet dial-up business, now owns a property that may help define the future of news. How big is The Huffington Post, exactly? A recent report from The Street put the upstart media company just behind The New York Times in terms of web traffic -- and set to overtake The Gray Lady. The Times started in 1851; The Huffington Post began in 2005. Perhaps it's The Huffington Post's relative youth that's stimulated such derision among media executives. Rapidly changing markets are easily dismissed as fads until it's too late. Is it pride, perhaps, that's prevented many of the leading media brands from experimenting with aggregation, populist content and a blogging community that may at times appear amateurish? Is it a fear of the unknown, or of irreparably damaging a brand built up over decades (and in some cases, more than a century)? Or a compulsion to serve up the news we need to know, rather than the news we want? Perhaps it's simply that the news media, comforted for years by the defensibility of its distribution channels -- ordinary citizens couldn't afford a printing press or start a television channel -- has been slow to mobilize in response to the threat of a million niche blogs and thousands of new ways to discover, parse, aggregate and reorganize the news. Whatever the cause, the market has spoken. The Huffington Post and rivals like Gawker Media are racking up the page views as older -- and supposedly wiser -- brands find this rapid growth evasive. But the signal is clear and startling. A $315 million Web property is no longer a blog. It's a fully fledged modern media company. The effect, I think, will be to shock the news media into action. Not only will we see a rapid consolidation of the industry as the old guard seeks to buy or merge its way into this emergent online market (see also: the Newsweek-Daily Beast merger), but we'll see increased investment in those upstarts that choose to go it alone. Most of all, I hope we'll see a news industry more willing to embrace risk, experimentation and occasional failures -- or face losing the war to a former dial-up provider with nothing to lose and everything to gain. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pete Cashmore.","AOL's $315 million purchase of the Huffington Post is a bold bet on the Web's potential .

"(CNN) -- Bangladesh pulled off one of the big upsets of the 2011 Cricket World Cup by beating England by two wickets in a thrilling Group B match at Chittagong on Friday. The co-hosts kept alive their hopes of qualifying for the quarterfinals and left England in danger of crashing out of the tournament following a second defeat in five matches. The English must now win their final game next Thursday against the West Indies, who earlier survived a scare before beating Ireland and have an extra game to play against unbeaten India. Bangladesh also have two matches left, against fellow minnows the Netherlands on Monday and then heavyweights South Africa on March 19, and will qualify in the top four with wins in both. England posted a disappointing total of 225, being bowled out in the final of the allotted 50 overs as Naeem Islam, Abdur Razzak and captain Shakib Al Hasan took two wickets each. Jonathan Trott top-scored with 67 while Eoin Morgan, playing his first match since replacing the injured Kevin Pietersen, contributed 63. Bangladesh had been bowled out for 58 by the Windies last Friday, but appeared to be cruising to a famous victory at 155-3 in the 31st over. However, opening batsman Imrul Kayes was needlessly run out for 60, Al Hasan (32) dragged a delivery from spinner Graeme Swann onto his stumps, then seam bowler Ajmal Shahzad dismissed Mushfiqur Rahim and Islam (0). Razzaq fell to Swann three runs later at 169-8, but Shafiul Islam joined Mahmudullah and gave Bangladesh hope. Islam hit four fours and a six as he scored 24 off as many balls faced, while Mahmudullah made a dogged 21 off 42. The tide turned in the 46th over when England swing bowler James Anderson conceded 11 runs, including seven wides. Islam then hit two boundaries in Tim Bresnan's next over to bring the target down to 12 runs from 18 balls, and Mahmudullah hit the same bowler to the boundary with the last delivery of the 49th to give Bangladesh a second win in 15 meetings with the three-time World Cup runners-up. ""I thought Mahmudullah and Shafiul batted exceptionally well. At one stage we thought we'd lost the game but they showed their character, how tough they are and how hard-working,"" Al Hasan told AFP. Ireland also beat England earlier this month, and had been on target to follow that up with a win over the West Indies at Mohali until a controversial umpiring decision turned the game. The Windies had posted a total of 275 as opener Devon Smith scored his first century in one-day internationals, going on to make 107, and all-rounder Kieron Pollard smashed 94 off 55 balls -- hitting eight fours and five sixes. Pollard also pulled off a fine catch to dismiss dangerman Kevin O'Brien, Ireland's match-winner against England, but the Irish needed just 76 runs to win off the last nine overs with half their wickets remaining when Gary Wilson was given out for 61. Sri Lankan umpire Asoka de Silva ruled that Wilson had been trapped leg before wicket by Darren Sammy, and the batsman's call for a second review was unsuccessful even though it appeared that he should not have been given out. Ireland then lost their last four wickets cheaply as left-arm spinner Sulieman Benn finished with 4-53 alongside Sammy's earlier three strikes as the Windies moved up to second place, a point above England. In Saturday's only game, India face South Africa in Nagpur, while Sunday sees Group B matches between Canada and New Zealand, then Australia and Kenya.","Bangladesh batsmen succeed in chase for 226 runs to beat England in Chittagong .

"(CNN) -- Two stunt pilots survived a plane crash caused by engine trouble at an air show in Texas on Saturday, the Federal Aviation Administration said. Stunned onlookers at the Air Fiesta show watched as the plane plummeted, leaving a white trail behind as it dove toward a wooded area near an airport in Brownsville, Texas. The stunt team onboard -- married couple Kyle and Amanda Franklin -- ""suffered severe burns following the crash,"" according to a statement on the air show's website. They were in the middle of a wing-walking act when the engine problems began, FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford said. ""The female wing-walker was able to get back into the airplane, but the plane crashed into a thicket near the runway,"" Lunsford said. On their website, the couple describes their act: ""Together Kyle and Amanda have created a swaggering, wing-walking pirate show that would make Captain Jack Sparrow gulp.

"(CNN) -- The parents of a Texas toddler are struggling for answers days after their young son mysteriously disappeared from a house full of people. Sabrina Benitez, the 18-month-old's mother, said she believes the boy was abducted -- insisting it would have been all but impossible for her boy to go outside. Even if he did, Benitez said, the toddler would have been smart enough to try to get back in or would have been spotted by now. But New Braunfels Police Lt. Michael Penshorn said as of Monday, it's most likely that young Joshua Davis Jr. left the home without anyone noticing or taking him. ""The first scenario that we are looking at is that somehow the child was able to exit the house ... and basically disappear into the night,"" he told HLN's Nancy Grace on Monday. Benitez, also speaking on HLN, said she was watching ""Toy Story"" with Joshua shortly before 8 p.m. Friday when he left the room, heading toward where six other adults and another child were. About 10 minutes later, when the boy hadn't come back to watch the video or pick up a toy, Benitez asked the others about his whereabouts. But Joshua was nowhere to be found, neither inside nor outside the house. Within minutes, family members called police -- who investigated the scene and sent an alert to 2,500 nearby residents. One individual came in and out of the house between when Benitez last saw the toddler and reported him missing, but that person is not considered a suspect. Penshorn said police don't think anyone at the house took the child. No Amber Alert has been issued for Joshua because such an alert typically requires solid evidence that an abduction took place. ""If for some reason somebody came and took that child, not only would (the people inside) have seen the child leave the residence, but they would have seen somebody come inside and take him,"" Penshorn said. Still, Benitez said her toddler couldn't have gotten outside himself, noting he wasn't tall enough to turn a doorknob. ""The only way that the baby would have gotten out the door is (if) the front door (was) open,"" she said. ""But we had the doors closed."" Ice covered the steps outside, leading Benitez to believe that there would be signs of Josh if he did get out. Still, as of Monday, police searches involving people, helicopters and dogs hadn't led to any signs of the boy. ""They had scent dogs out here, and (they) said there was no scent of him leaving the yard,"" the toddler's father, Josh Davis Sr., told CNN affiliate KENS. ""So I don't see how he could have wandered off, or else they would have picked something up.""","Family members and Texas police are looking for 18-month-old Joshua Davis Jr.

"(EW.com) -- Does invoking the mighty name of ""Avatar"" to describe the pleasures of ""Mars Needs Moms"" sound presumptuous? Hear me out: ""Avatar"" is a great, myth-minded adventure about a human guy able to project himself into the beatifically peaceful world of the Na'vi from Pandora. Despite an earthbound script, the movie, with its computer-generated imagery and 3-D effects, is visually magnificent, proudly so. Also long. In a parallel universe, ""Mars Needs Moms"" is a great, jaunty adventure about an unruly kid named Milo (Seth Green, the right guy for the job) who had no plans to go to Mars but finds himself there anyway. He's been inadvertently scooped up by the same alien kidnappers who made off with his mother (Joan Cusack, custom-fit) to plunder her maternal DNA for child-rearing tips. (Martian surveillance has verified that Milo's mom is good at nagging her boy to take out the trash.) Enhanced by nimble ad-libbing from the comedy-trained cast, the screenplay is delightful, by turns funny and emotional, as befits a Disney family fable in which, through wacky adversity, Mom and kid reaffirm their love for each other while Dad is nowhere in sight. (He's not dead, just away on business.) And with its splendid use of computer-generated motion-capture animation and 3-D effects, the movie is also visually magnificent -- modestly so. Plus, it's half the length of ""Avatar."" I don't know why performance-capture moviemaking -- the kind pioneered in ""The Polar Express"" and ""A Christmas Carol"" by Robert Zemeckis, who also produced ""Mars Needs Moms"" -- hasn't received more applause. Thanks to its unique ability to blend both animate and inanimate subjects in one magical landscape, it may be the technology-based artistic medium best suited to 3-D projects. More on movies from EW.com . Certainly it's the right way to go when visiting the Mars of this cool story, a wittily conceived planet of curvy female soldiers and sidelined males, ruled by a splendidly screechy old crone called the Supervisor. (She's voiced by Austin Powers' excellent Frau Farbissina herself, Mindy Sterling.) Milo, by the way, would be dead on the Red Planet without the help of a fellow human who calls himself Gribble (slam-dunk excitability from Dan Fogler). Another dude whose mom was picked up for Martian study years ago, Gribble is a chatterbox, a slob with a big heart, and a resourceful geek who lends Milo a weight belt so the boy doesn't waft away in zero gravity.

"(CNN) -- A magnitude-4.4 earthquake rattled residents of southern California early Tuesday morning, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries, authorities said. However, police and fire officials said they had received calls from residents awakened by the quake. Its epicenter was 11 miles east-southeast of the Los Angeles Civic Center, the USGS reported. It struck at 4:04 a.m. ""First it was a small one and then a big one,"" said Chris Curiel, who was working at the Vallejo Mini Market in Whittier, a town near the epicenter. ""It felt like the floor was sinking."" He said merchandise on the shelves began shaking, but there was no damage. Because his market is a gas station, earthquakes are a bit more worrisome, he said. Curiel said he knew immediately an earthquake was happening, and he has felt one before. Ravi Singh, night shift supervisor at a 7-Eleven in Pico Rivera -- the town a mile east-northeast of the epicenter -- told CNN he was making coffee when the store's windows started rattling. There was no damage, he said. ""Everything is fine."" iReporter says ""it sounded like there were kids dancing upstairs"" Although the temblor was centered 11 miles below the Earth's surface, according to USGS, the movement was enough to awaken some southern Californians. ""It felt like two quick jolts,"" said CNN's Rosalina Nieves. ""I felt some shaking, and I wasn't sure if it was just my upstairs neighbor ... but then you definitely felt two quick jolts."" She said the movement lasted for a couple of seconds. While earthquakes are common in southern California, Nieves, a native of Los Angeles, said recent earthquakes in Chile and Haiti have caused concern. ""The first thing that jumps into your mind is, 'Is this the big one?'"" she said. CNN's Maria White contributed to this report.","Magnitude 4.4 earthquake strikes at 4:04 a.m.

"Bangkok (CNN) -- Border skirmishes between Thailand and Cambodia over a temple have grown quiet, a Thai military official said Wednesday. ""There has been no gun firing for two days now, the last firing was on Monday,"" said Col. Shingark Rattanakitti.  ""The situation in general here is calm, but we are all on high alert."" The development came as the chairman of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations pushed for talks between the two nations to end the deadly clashes. The issue ""can only be addressed bilaterally,"" Marty M. Natalegawa, who is also the Indonesian foreign minister, said Tuesday.  He added that he has the impression, after visiting Phnom Penh and Bangkok, that there is an overwhelming commitment on both sides to ""address their issues through peaceful means, through dialogues and negotiations."" The United Nations Security Council will hold a meeting on Monday to discuss the tensions between Thailand and Cambodia. Diplomats from both countries will be given a chance to address the council. The meeting comes after a request from Cambodia for the council to hold an emergency session. The border skirmishes, which started Friday, have killed five people, including members of the military and civilians, a statement from ASEAN said, adding that each nation accuses the other of firing first. Thailand's official news agency, MCOT, reported Tuesday, ""Since the fighting erupted Friday, one Thai soldier was killed, 25 were wounded and one civilian died in the clashes."" The report added that Cambodia on Tuesday ""handed over a Thai soldier captured during the cross border clash."" Cambodia's official news agency, AKP, reported Tuesday that ""Cambodian Prime Minister Samdech Akka Moha Sena Padei Techo Hun Sen has sought the United Nations' intervention in arranging a buffer zone"" at the border area and wants to make sure the fighting does not expand to other parts of the border. The U.N. Security Council on Monday expressed ""grave concern at aggravation of tensions between Cambodia and Thailand"" and said it was willing to hold an emergency meeting requested by Cambodia, but first wanted to wait for regional mediation efforts by the Indonesian foreign minister. An official Thai report said the two sides had agreed to a ceasefire on Saturday, but skirmishes continued afterward. The clashes stem from a longstanding conflict related to the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple. The building sits on a cliff in Cambodian territory, but the most accessible entrance to the site is on the Thai side. In a letter to the United Nations over the weekend, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said that in addition to the human toll the fighting was taking, the temple had suffered damage. Conflict over the Preah Vihear site has taken place periodically for years. In 1962, the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, ruled that the site was in Cambodia, adding that the structure was ""an outstanding masterpiece of Khmer architecture."" But Thailand says the 1.8-square mile (4.7-square kilometer) area around Preah Vihear was never fully demarcated, and blames a map drawn at the beginning of the 20th century during the French occupation of Cambodia. In July 2008, the United Nations approved Cambodia's application to have the temple listed as a World Heritage Site, meaning the U.N. believes the place has outstanding universal value. CNN's Whitney Hurst contributed to this report.","ASEAN official believes there is overwhelming commitment for a peaceful resolution .

"(CNN) -- About 14,000 Ivory Coast residents escaping their country's political instability and violence have fled to eastern Liberia in what has been an arduous journey, the United Nations refugee agency said Saturday. People are walking several hours or days before they get on barges to the rivers bordering the West African nations, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees said. A few deaths have been reported among the refugees, including a child who drowned during the crossing of the Cestos River into Butuo. Observers are seeing malnourished children and people with malaria, respiratory infections and diarrhea. ""We are referring the most severe cases to Saclepea, a five-hour drive on very rough roads. In some locations without ambulances we are transferring the patients on board UNHCR vehicles,"" the agency said in a statement. ""Some are arriving with severely swollen feet, like a 75-year-old man whom we transferred from Butuo, one of the main entry points into Liberia. Some families said they had walked three to four days through the bush with little food."" The displacement is the fallout of the November 28 presidential runoff, after which the country's Independent Electoral Commission named opposition leader Alassane Ouattara the winner. But its Constitutional Council invalidated those results and declared that incumbent President Laurent Gbagbo won. The country has been paralyzed by a political stalemate and scores of people have died in violence there. International powers, such as the United States, the United Nations, and the African Union have recognized Ouattara as the winner and are urging Gbagbo to cede power. Leaders from the Economic Community of West African States on Friday warned they will not hesitate to use ""legitimate force"" to defuse the crisis if Gbagbo fails to step down. The refugee agency said ""humanitarian needs are increasing for the mostly women and children refugees as well as for the villagers hosting them"" and the growing number of newcomers is affecting host communities. The agency has so far registered 14,000 Ivorian refugees in eastern Liberia and has prepared supplies to help up to 30,000 refugees in the area. ""Food supplies are running short despite efforts by the government and humanitarian agencies to bring in more assistance,"" the agency said. ""Our staff report that host community houses are full and congested. In the area of Butuo for example there are homes where 7 to 20 family members share a single room, while others sleep in corridors or on verandas."" The U.N refugee agency is concerned about reports that some members of the Forces Nouvelles ""are preventing people from freely crossing into Liberia via the Loguato border crossing point."" That group supports Ouattara. ""This is causing refugees from the Danane villages to deviate their route by up to 80 kilometers southward to enter Liberia. UNHCR is calling for the protection of civilians and respect for the right to seek asylum without hindrance.""","A few deaths have been reported, including a drowned child .

"(CNN) -- Businesses may still be suffering from the effects of widespread economic downturn, but the world's leading football clubs are earning more than ever according to a new report. The top-20 teams generated a record €4.3 billion ($5.9 billion) in the 2009-10 season, an 8% increase on the previous period, says financial advisor Deloitte. Its Football Money League, released on Thursday, revealed that Spanish clubs Real Madrid and Barcelona remained top of the earnings table ahead of England's Manchester United and Germany's Bayern Munich. ""All bar three of the top-20 clubs achieved revenue growth during 2009-10, demonstrating the continued resilience of football's top clubs as the full impact of the global economic downturn took hold,"" Deloitte's Dan Jones said. ""The game's top clubs have proved themselves well-placed to meet these economic challenges given their large and loyal supporter bases, ability to drive broadcast audiences, and continuing attraction to corporate partners."" Real's income rose to €438.6 million ($601 million) despite not winning a trophy following the world-record $130 million signing of Cristiano Ronaldo and the $92 million capture of Kaka. Barcelona, who won the Spanish title and reached the Champions League semifinals, will soon become the second team to top €400 million in revenue -- according to Jones -- following its decision to accept paid shirt sponsorship. The Catalan club generated €398 million ($546 million) last season, an increase of almost €33 million ($45 million). ""The club has now entered into its first paid-for, multi-year shirtfront sponsorship deal, for a guaranteed minimum of €165 million over the duration of the contract, a new world record,"" Jones said. ""We expect the battle for top spot in the Money League to be between Spain's two superclubs for the next few years at least."" The top-six was unchanged, with United's Premier League rivals Arsenal and Chelsea rounding it out. AC Milan moved up to seventh, giving Italy three clubs in the top-10 ahead of city rivals Inter and Juventus. Revealing a huge gap in Spanish clubs' spending power, Atletico Madrid was the World Cup-winning nation's only other entry at 17th. England, by contrast, had seven clubs including Liverpool in eighth and Manchester City -- rising nine places to 11th. Italy and Germany both had four entries -- the latter country seeing Werder Bremen and current league leaders Borussia Dortmund drop out -- with France's Lyon and Marseille 14th and 15th respectively.","Spanish clubs Real Madrid and Barcelona stay top of football's earnings table .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Libyan state TV reported Sunday that the opposition-held town of al-Bregahad been ""been cleansed from the criminal gangs and mercenaries, the area is now safe, and all citizens should go back to their work and their normal life."" Forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi have been fighting to recapture towns from the rebels since an uprising began last month. Opposition leaders in Benghazi confirmed to CNN that their forces have left al-Brega, but they are calling their move a ""tactical retreat."" The military has been pounding the key oil port of Ras Lanuf, once in the hands of rebel forces, and has taken control of towns such as nearby Bin Jawad. The Gadhafi government appears intent on retaking all territory from the opposition despite growing international pressure. Libya's National Oil Corporation, meanwhile, urged companies to resume oil exports after saying that all ports are safe, state TV reported. Also Sunday, the Maryland-based SITE Intelligence Group released a video in which it says Abu Yahya al-Libi, an al Qaeda leader, calls on Libyans to take up arms against Gadhafi. The Libyan leader has frequently accused al Qaeda of being behind the unrest that began last month and has since spiraled into a civil war. The Arab League voted Saturday to back a no-fly zone ""to protect the civilian population"" in Libya, the body's secretary-general Amre Moussa said. ""We will inform the U.N. Security Council of our request to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya,"" Moussa said. ""The U.N. Security Council should decide how it will be enforced."" The Libyan foreign ministry denounced the League's move, calling it a ""flagrant action against its charter,"" according to state TV Sunday. It also reported that the ministry would welcome the arrival of a fact-finding mission sent by some African nations. Also Saturday, an Al-Jazeera cameraman was killed in an apparent ambush near Benghazi, Libya, becoming the first journalist killed in the country since the start of the civil war, the network reported. Ali Hassan al Jaber was returning to Benghazi, an opposition stronghold in the east, from a nearby town where he had reported on an opposition protest when ""unknown fighters opened fire on a car he and his colleagues were traveling in,"" Al-Jazeera reported on its English-language website. The cameraman and another person were wounded. Al Jaber was rushed to a hospital, but did not survive, the network said. ""Al-Jazeera condemns the cowardly crime, which comes as part of the Libyan regime's malicious campaign targeting Al-Jazeera and its staff,"" the network reported. The no-fly zone which the Arab League is calling for would be a preventive measure and would have to be stopped immediately when the Libyan crisis ends, Youssef bin Alawi bin Abdullah, Oman's foreign minister said in a joint appearance with Moussa. Arab League members have reservations about military intervention, but said all countries agreed that a no-fly zone must be imposed urgently to protect civilians, bin Abdullah said. ""We hope the Libyan authorities will respect a no-fly decision,"" he said. ""Be assured the Arab countries will not accept the intervention of the NATO coalition."" Moussa said the league also voted to open channels of communication with the Transitional National Council, the Libyan opposition's newly formed administration, and that any talks with that body would be on a humanitarian basis. ""We are giving them legitimacy but we're not giving them political recognition,"" Moussa said. ""We are prepared to help evacuate any Arab nationals from Libya regardless of their nationality."" The Arab League also called for immediate humanitarian assistance and an end to the bloodshed in Libya, where war has broken out between forces loyal to Gadhafi and a tenacious opposition movement. The White House cheered the League's announcements and stressed it will continue to pressure Gadhafi, support the opposition and prepare for ""all contingencies."" Opposition forces made strides in the early days of the rebellion, but Gadhafi's military has recently gained strong momentum. The League was meeting at its headquarters in Cairo, while hundreds of demonstrators outside urged the international community to step up support for Libyan opposition groups. Pleading for international help as they continue to lose ground to pro-Gadhafi forces, rebels are asking for a no-fly zone that would theoretically thwart airstrikes. No-fly zones are areas where aircraft are not allowed to fly. Such zones were put in place after the Gulf War in southern and northern Iraq as a check on the forces of the late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Western powers have said any action by the international community, including a no-fly zone, would have to have regional support and a clear mandate from the United Nations. U.S. President Barack Obama said Friday that he ""won't take (the) decision lightly"" on whether to use military force, including helping to enforce a no-fly zone, saying it is critical to ""balance costs versus benefits."" While France has recognized the National Transitional Council as the sole representative of the Libyan people, the European Union was more restrained Friday, saying it ""welcomes and encourages the interim transitional national council based in Benghazi, which it considers a political interlocutor."" The Libyan government on Saturday took journalists to the eastern city of Bin Jawad, where the government ousted rebels about a week ago. CNN's Nic Robertson said he saw fighter jets in the sky but he didn't see them engage in strikes. He saw some structural damage, such as a blown-out police station and damage to a school and houses, including a Katyusha rocket embedded in the wall of a house. Some stores were closed and others had been looted. CNN's Yousuf Basil and Reza Sayah and journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.","NEW: Foreign ministry denounces Arab League's call for no-fly zone, state TV says .

"Tunis, Tunisia (CNN) -- Italy's coast guard says at least 1,623 migrants have landed on the tiny island of Lampedusa over a 24-hour period. According to a coast guard statement released Tuesday, at least seven boats believed to have taken off from Tunisia landed on the Italian island with more than 400 passengers. The rest of the people were rescued at sea by Italian maritime patrols. Sailors at the Tunisian fishing port of Zarzis said they have seen a spike in the number of boats full of migrants departing on the dangerous 16- to 24-hour journey to Lampedusa, about 100 kilometers (62 miles, or 54 nautical miles) away. ""Yesterday, seven boats left here for Lampedusa,"" Faisal Jebnoun said Monday as he pulled seaweed and other debris from his net after a long day fishing for squid. ""The youth are crazy,"" Jebnoun added.  ""They all think they'll find a better life in Italy, and they don't even speak Italian!"" Italy has seen a surge in migrants from Tunisia since the North African country experienced a revolution in January that threw longtime President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali from power. Lampedusa is often a favored target since it is one of the southernmost European points in the Mediterranean Sea. At one point, said Souei Abdesslem, president of the Blue-fish Union in Zarzis, so many young Tunisians were anxious to smuggle themselves to Europe that fishermen began sleeping in their boats to prevent them from being stolen for the hazardous passage across the Mediterranean. The Italian coast guard reported that it had rescued five passengers Sunday night who said their boat sank, with 35 other passengers still missing. Dozens of passengers from a Tunisian boat are believed to have died in January after it collided with a Tunisian coast guard vessel on a similar journey. Coast guard spokesman Cosimo Nicastro said he expects that the recent surge of migrants will decrease because of forecasts of stormy weather in the days ahead.","At least 1,623 landed on the island over a 24-hour period .

"Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic (CNN) -- Trapped beneath his collapsed home in Port-au-Prince, rescuers had to amputate Georges Exantus' right leg in order to free him. He was one of the survivors from Haiti's January 12 earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people. Exantus, 29, was quickly rushed to a hospital in neighboring Dominican Republic, where he spent over two months recovering. Now, he is waiting at a bus stop in Santo Domingo, heading back to Haiti. Back to uncertainty. Back to zero. ""Staying in the Dominican Republic is not an option,"" he said. That's because the Dominican Republic's government is forcing Haitian refugees to return home after they have received medical treatment there. But it is unclear where Exantus and others like him will go. It could take more than a decade to rebuild Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, which was devastated by the 7.0 magnitude temblor.  Read more about Haiti's recovery efforts . ""We share one island, but it is probably easier to find refuge for Haitians in France than in the Dominican Republic"", said Hode Hyppolite, a family friend who accompanied Exantus back to Port-au-Prince. Haiti and Dominican Republic are united by geography, sharing the island of Hispaniola, both former sugar colonies under France and Spain respectively. However, Haitians and Dominicans have had tense relations dating back as far as the mid-19th century, when Haiti occupied Dominican Republic for more than 20 years. Following this year's earthquake, Dominican Republic offered its hospitals and medical services to Haitians.  That solidarity gave hope to some Haitians inside the Dominican Republic that their status may change. ""This is a double standard policy: Haitian immigrants are needed in the Dominican Republic but not wanted,"" said Bridget Wooding, who analyzes migration on Hispaniola. Dominican Republic has always relied heavily on Haitian workers for its agriculture and construction industries. A flood of Haitian workers poured into the country after the overthrow of Haitian dictator Jean-Claude ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier in 1986. Research conducted before the January 12 quake showed that Haitians made up nearly 80 percent of Dominican Republic's agricultural labor force, according to the Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences in Santo Domingo and the International Organization for Migration. That is a reverse of the government's required ratio of 80 percent native workers to 20 percent foreign workers. While there are no official government statistics, analysts estimate that up to one million unauthorized Haitian workers live in Dominican Republic. Although the Dominican Republic's government says it has beefed up its border security, experts say the border remains porous. ""Daily there are more than 100 trips carried out from the different places [along the border] loading Haitian immigrants,"" analyst Jose Luis Fernandez said. Fernandez analyzes refugee and immigration patterns for the Jesuit Refugee Services in Dajabon, Dominican Republic, on the border with Haiti.  There are no exact figures, but based on his observations, Fernandez believes the number of illegal Haitian workers has quadrupled since the January 12 quake. Marie Noel, a Haitian who gives massages to tourists at the Boca Chica beach near Santo Domingo, knows how easy it is to cross. ""You pay 5,000 Pesos [around $140] to an agent and if you have problems at the border you pay a little extra,"" she explained. Many Haitians usually arrive in the Dominican Republic to work on the sugar plantations for about $2 a day. Like most illegal immigrants with no papers, they face discrimination and live in constant fear of deportation. Amy Serrano has documented the labor conditions of Haitians and their children in Dominican sugar plants in her 2007 film, ""The Sugar Babies."" ""People who are promised a better life end up on sugar plantations with no identification and no rights,"" she said. Further complicating the immigration issue, Dominican Republic's new constitution took effect just two weeks after the January earthquake. It restricts citizenship for the children of Haitian immigrants. The relationship between Haiti and the Dominican Republic is a ""work in progress,"" according to José Achécar, who monitors poverty data for the government in Santo Domingo. ""There is a lot of xenophobia against Haitians,"" he said. ""We are like oil and water, we don't mix. But we may get closer through this catastrophe. We need each other. We share one island."" Those sentiments mean little for Georges Exantus, who had to be lifted onto the bus that took him back to Haiti. ""I want to return to Haiti, it is my home,"" he said. ""But there is nothing for me now.""","Haitians still illegally entering Dominican Republic, months after deadly quake .

"Rome (CNN) -- A lawyer for Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has asked Rome prosecutors to investigate an alleged attempt to falsify the birth records of the woman at the center of a sex scandal embroiling the prime minister. The alleged falsification appears to be an attempt to make her appear not to have been a minor when Berlusconi allegedly paid to have sex with her. Rome prosecutors did not immediately respond to CNN questions about the case. Authorities allege that Berlusconi had a liaison with 17-year-old Karima el Mahroug, nicknamed ""Ruby the heart-stealer,"" last spring during parties at his villa -- which both deny. Berlusconi is scheduled to stand trial in April on charges that he paid the underage girl for sex and abused his position as prime minister by trying to get her out of police custody, which he also denies. The Italian daily Il Fatto Quotidiano reported last week that someone had tried to falsify the birth records. Berlusconi's lawyer, Nicolo Ghedini. said in a statement that he asked Rome prosecutors to investigate the allegation that two Italian ""emissaries"" had visited a birth-registry official in Morocco, where el Mahroug was born, and offered bribes to make the young dancer seem older. The dancer's age is significant because it is illegal to have sex with a prostitute in Italy only if she is a minor. Ghedini suggested in the statement that he requested the investigation to establish that Berlusconi had nothing to do with any attempt to change birth records. ""We are dealing with something that tries to surreptitiously damage gravely Prime Minister Berlusconi, who is completely estranged to any eventual illegal action,"" the prime minister's lawyer said in a statement. Berlusconi has been tried on at least 17 charges since his first term as prime minister began in 1994, but none of the cases have resulted in lasting convictions. Several were overturned on appeal. CNN's Hada Messia contributed to this report.","Berlusconi lawyer asks prosecutors to investigate an alleged attempt to make ""Ruby"" seem older .

"Camp Verde, Arizona (CNN) -- Jurors in the trial of self-help guru and speaker James Ray, accused of three counts of manslaughter in a 2009 Arizona sweat lodge ceremony, heard a recording Wednesday in which he previewed the intense ceremony and told participants how it would be a ""death and rebirth experience."" Before the October 2009 ceremony at a retreat center near Sedona, Ray told participants it would include the most ""intense heat you've every experienced in your life. You will feel like you are going to die."" The author described the ceremony as a sacred way for participants to rid themselves of ""all the things that you've allowed to be your truth and have caused you to sell yourself short."" He promised each would emerge as a ""different person."" The participants would then enjoy a celebratory dinner and share personal breakthroughs in an evening session. But something went horribly wrong. Three people died during or after the purification ceremony and Ray was charged in their deaths. The defense told jurors in opening statements last week the three died in a ""tragic accident -- not a crime."" Prosecutors  maintain Ray psychologically pressured participants to remain in the lodge even when they weren't feeling well, contributing to their deaths. In the recording, Ray told participant, who paid up to $10,000 each to attend the event, that as ""true spiritual warriors"" and their ""altered state"" they would endure heat so intense it would make it feel like their skins was coming off of their bodies. ""I will be right there with you,"" he said. ""You will have to get to a point where you surrender to death,"" Ray said.  ""When you are going into the lodge symbolically you are going back into the womb of mother earth."" ""It is such a great metaphor ..."" the author said. ""My body dies but I never die."" Prosecutors argue that the lodge -- made of willow trees and branches, and covered with tarpaulins and blankets -- was heated to perilously high temperatures, causing the participants to suffer dehydration and heatstroke. During his recorded talk, Ray repeatedly told participants to drink plenty of fluids. But Dennis Mehravar testified he had not much to drink in the previous 36 hours and had only a short time to hydrate. And the real estate salesman from Canada said no physical examination or medical information was required before the event. Another participant, Nell Wagoner, told jurors she saw no preparations by Ray's staff for any medical emergencies. Ray told participants that if conditions became unbearable, they could leave when the lodge flap was opened. He promised a transcending experience. ""You will be in such an altered state,"" Ray said. ""You may see visions. It's a great opportunity to explore your own consciousness."" Wagoner, a gynecologist from Juneau, Alaska, and a participant in the program, testified she was concerned that a man who had been burned on his hand inside the lodge was allowed back in. Ray said a nurse would assist the participant, she testified. But Wagoner also said she did not perceive participants in the lodge's dark interior needed medical attention. If they had, she would have provided assistance, the doctor told jurors. Wagoner said she would not have entered the lodge if she thought there was a possibility she might die. Wagoner testified that Ray never stopped anyone from leaving the sweat lodge. She acknowledged under cross-examination that water and fortified drinks were available to participants. Earlier, Jennifer Haley, who served as a volunteer at the 2009 event near Sedona, took the stand for the fourth day Wednesday to talk about how she and other ""Dream Team"" members tried to help ceremony participants. Under cross-examination, Haley acknowledged that, in a police interview on the day of the ceremony, she suggested the deaths and injuries were an innocent accident and that perhaps something on rocks inside the lodge contributed to the injuries. The heat in the sweat lodge was maintained by heated rocks brought in by ""firetenders"" during regular intervals in the ceremony. Ray is charged with three counts of reckless manslaughter in connection with the October 2009 incident at the spiritual retreat. If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison on each count. Wagoner said she told detectives that they should look at carbon monoxide levels and dehydration among participants. Haley also said ceremony participants had been warned about how hot the lodge would be and that Ray never told anyone who left during the event they would have to return. The man who burned his hand voluntarily returned to the lodge. Kirby Brown, 38, of Westtown, New York, and James Shore, 40, of Milwaukee, died the night of the event. Volunteer Lizbeth Marie Neuman, 49, of Prior Lake, Minnesota, died nine days after the ceremony. The so-called sweat lodge -- which was 5 feet tall and 23 feet wide, and built to accommodate up to 75 people -- was the site of a purification ritual for participants modeled on Native American customs. Ray encouraged participants to hydrate throughout the retreat and warned them the sweat lodge would be very hot, his attorney has said. Participants signed a release form saying that the retreat activities could include a sweat lodge with enclosed spaces and high temperatures, Luis Li said in his opening statement last week. The defense has asserted that the symptoms exhibited by the victims are consistent with poisoning from an unknown toxin.
