"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- At 33, Joe Sullivan is serving a life term without the possibility of parole in a Florida prison while confined to a wheelchair. Joe Sullivan, now 33, was convicted of burglary and rape when he was 13. He is serving a life sentence without parole. The crime for which he was convicted was brutal: burglary and the rape of a 72-year-old woman in Pensacola. The man's lawyers say the punishment was equally harsh, particularly for someone with Sullivan's circumstances. He was 13 at the time, and is one of only two people his age in the world, say his supporters, tried as an adult and sentenced to ""die in prison"" for a crime that wasn't a homicide. Now the Supreme Court is being asked to decide whether  that sentence was cruel and unusual punishment for someone who was barely a teenager at the time of his crime. The justices are scheduled to announce Monday whether they will accept the case for review. If they do, oral arguments would be held in the fall. If the review is rejected, Sullivan would have few legal options remaining to reduce his sentence. His lawyers are also fighting to get him a new trial. Outside a death-penalty context, the high court has offered little recent guidance on how to treat the youngest of underage criminal defendants. The appellate record for rapists under age 15 is almost nonexistent, say legal experts consulted by CNN. Child legal advocates say many states lack adequate resources to handle young inmates given long sentences, including a lack of proper jailhouse counseling. Few studies have been conducted on the psychological effects on young defendants facing life in prison, said the Equal Justice Institute, which is representing Sullivan in the high court case. ""We have created a forgotten population with a lot of needs,"" said Bryan Stevenson, Sullivan's lawyer. The crime happened in 1989, when Sullivan later admitted he and two friends ransacked a home in West Pensacola. But he denied the prosecutor's claim he returned with a knife and sexually assaulted the elderly homeowner. An older co-defendant claimed Sullivan was the rapist. According to the trial record, the victim testified the assailant was a youngster with ""kinky hair and he was quite black and he was small."" She could not recognize Sullivan by his facial features, but the defendant was made to repeat at trial what he allegedly told the woman: ""If you can't identify me, I may not have to kill you."" The victim testified, ""It's been six months, it's hard, but it does sound similar."" After a daylong trial, Escambia County circuit court Judge Nicholas Geeker sentenced Sullivan to life without parole. ""I am going to try to send him away for as long as I can, he is beyond help,"" the judge told the boy. ""The juvenile system has been utterly incapable of doing anything with Mr. Sullivan."" Sullivan had a lengthy juvenile record, but continues to deny the attack. At the time, state prosecutor Larry Kaden, who retired last month, said, ""It was a brutal crime and he had an extensive record. This was a bad, bad crime."" The Florida Attorney General's office told the high court that prosecutors should have the discretion they have long been given to decide how harshly young criminal should be prosecuted. Sexual battery remains a crime punishable by life imprisonment in Florida. A study by the Equal Justice Institute found eight prisoners serving life terms for crimes committed at 13, all in the United States. Besides Sullivan, Florida inmate Ian Manuel is in a similar situation. He was 13 when convicted of attempted murder and robbery in 1990 and will not get out of prison. The Justice Department reports no 13-year-old has been given life without parole for crime that wasn't a homicide in a decade. And while about a thousand people every year under 15 are arrested for rape, none have been given life without parole since Sullivan. Only a handful of states -- including Alaska, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico and Oregon -- prohibit sentencing minors to life without a chance for parole, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Equal Justice Institute says 19 states have laws allowing the possibility of life without parole for those under age 14. The high court in April 2008 refused to hear the case of a South Carolina boy who was 12 when he murdered his grandparents and was given a 30-year sentence, the maximum allowed under state law. Tried as an adult, Christopher Pittman's lawyers had argued the sentence was excessive, and that heavy doses of antidepressants the boy was taking at the time sent his mind spinning out off control. While disappointed, Pittman's attorney Michelle Deitch speculated the justices may ""have recognized the growing national trend against sentencing young children to harsh mandatory terms in prison, and wants to give state legislatures the opportunity to correct this problem before it rules again on the issue."" Sullivan's attorneys hope the high court is ready to revisit the issue. The Supreme Court in 2005 banned the death penalty for underage killers. The justices in that case cited evolving ""national standards"" as a reason to ban such executions. ""When a juvenile commits a heinous crime, the state can exact a forfeiture of some of the most basic liberties,"" wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy at the time. ""But the state cannot extinguish his life and his potential to attain a mature understanding of his own humanity."" Sullivan is in deteriorating health from multiple sclerosis and  confined to ""close management"" for dangerous or trouble-prone inmates, say state corrections officials. His lawyers admit he has had more than a 100 incidents of fighting and threatening inmates and guards, and having contraband and weapons, but say Sullivan is the victim of bullying by other prisoners and is mentally disabled. ""It's important for the criminal justice system to recognize that inmates like Joe [Sullivan] are going to change, biologically, psychologically and emotionally as they grow up in prison,"" said Stevenson. ""We should not assume it is a change for the worse."" Sullivan's appellate team places much of the blame on his original trial attorney, who presented no opening statement and only brief closing remarks. No DNA results were offered and the state destroyed the biological evidence in 1993. ""It was absolutely outrageous,"" said Stevenson. The trial lawyer was later suspended from practicing law. The thrust of their argument before the high court is not that Sullivan is innocent, nor that he seeks his freedom now, just that he deserves to someday make his case before the state parole board.","Convicted for a crime committed at 13, Joe Sullivan appeals to Supreme Court .

"(CNN) -- Around 204,000 people have fled their homes in the Somali capital of Mogadishu as a result of a militant offensive against government forces, the U.N. refugee agency said on Tuesday. Islamist fighters exchange gunfire with government forces in Mogadishu on July 3. The eight-week long push by Al-Shaabab and Hisb-ul-Islam militias has prompted what the agency calls ""the biggest exodus from the troubled Somali capital since the Ethiopian intervention in 2007."" ""The escalating conflict in Mogadishu is having a devastating impact on the city's population causing enormous suffering and massive displacement,"" the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said. The agency said its local partners in the capital reported that fighting over the past week ""has killed some 105 people and injured 382."" ""Neighborhoods affected by the fighting include Kaaran, Shibis, Shangaani and Boondheere in North Mogadishu. These areas have hitherto been islands of peace, escaping much of the conflict and destruction. Many residents are fleeing their homes for the first time since the start of the Somali civil war in 1991,"" the agency said. The agency said the number of internally displaced people in Somalia amounts to more than 1.2 million people. There has been growing concern that Somalia, in the Horn of Africa, could be the next base for al Qaeda as U.S. forces pound their positions in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Last month, a U.S. State Department spokesman said the United States is providing weapons and ammunition to Somalia's transitional government as it fights al Qaeda-linked Islamist militants. CIA Director Leon Panetta recently said that the intelligence agency is keeping tabs on the region as a possible destination for fleeing al Qaeda operatives. ""Our concern right now is that likely safe havens are areas in the Horn of Africa, like Somalia and Yemen, that are countries that because of their political status can be attractive to al Qaeda in order to operate there,"" Panetta said earlier this month. Al-Shaabab, also known as the Mujahideen Youth Movement, was officially designated as a terrorist organization by the United States in March 2008. It is waging a war against Somalia's government in an effort to implement a stricter form of Islamic law.","Eight-week long push by Al-Shaabab and Hisb-ul-Islam militias prompted exodus .

"(CNN) -- Mexican authorities on Saturday arrested four men in connection with last week's shooting death of a U.S. Border Patrol agent in San Diego County, California, Mexico's state-run news agency Notimex reported. U.S. Border Patrol Agent Robert Rosas was fatally shot Thursday night in California, U.S. authorities said. Mexican federal police identified the men as human smugglers, and said they were in the act of transporting 21 immigrants when they were detained in the northwest state of Baja California, Notimex said. At a news conference, federal police identified two of the suspects as brothers Jose Eugenio Quintero Ruiz, 49, and Jose Evodio Quintero Ruiz, 43. The other two arrestees were taxi drivers Antonio Badallares Zepeda, 57 and Jose Alfredo Camacho Penuela, 34, Notimex reported. Border Patrol Agent Robert Rosas was shot and killed Thursday night while responding to a potential incursion into the United States in the Campo area in San Diego County, U.S. authorities said. The Mexican federal police did not offer specific evidence of the suspects' role in the killing, but said intelligence reports indicated the group was responsible for kidnappings, rapes and murders of several people who tried to cross to the United States, Notimex said. The men were wanted by American authorities, police said. Notimex said that during his interrogation, Jose Eugenio Quintero told investigators the shooter was Ernesto Parra Valenzuela, a man arrested the day before by local police in Tecate, Mexico. Rosas, who is survived by his wife and two young children, had been a border agent for three years. Rosas was the ninth Border Patrol agent to be killed while on duty since 2006, according to the agency's Web site. Two agents died in a vehicle wreck in 2006, and four died in 2007, including two who died in vehicle wrecks, a third who drowned and a fourth who suffered a heart attack while pursuing undocumented immigrants. Two agents died on duty last year, the Border Patrol said. One died in a single-vehicle wreck; another was struck and killed by a vehicle driven by a suspected smuggler, according to the agency's Web site.","Mexican news agency: Four arrested in connection with U.S. agent's death .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- For Olympic swimmer Eric Shanteau, the last two months have been a whirlwind. ""Full of the best moments and the scariest moments of my life,"" says the 24-year-old Olympic swimmer. Eric Shanteau said he felt angry when he found out he had testicular cancer. ""Getting to the Olympics was, has always been, my swimming dream since I was 8 or 9 years old. You know, right after I started swimming it was, 'I want to make an Olympic team. That's where I want to be'."" In June, a week before the qualifying round of the Olympics he was told he had testicular cancer. ""My initial reaction was probably anger more than anything else,"" he says. ""I'm used to being in control of everything. I'm in control of how I train, how I race and then to all of a sudden have that control ripped away from me was tough."" After weeks of tests to determine the ""stage"" or spread of the cancer, Shanteau's team of doctors cleared him to compete in the Beijing Olympics, which meant carefully monitoring his tumor but delaying treatment. Though putting off the surgery was controversial to some, Eric says it was an educated choice based on numerous doctor evaluations. ""I hope people understand that if I was in a different position with my test results, then I wouldn't have put off having surgery.""  Dr. Sanjay Gupta reports from Eric Shanteau's surgery » . He swam a personal best in the 200 meter breaststroke. He did not qualify for the finals. Cancer was a motivator, he says, because he knew it meant he could be facing his last competition. He put everything he had into that heat. ""Leave it all in the pool, and I don't look back and regret anything as far as how I raced."" Once back from Beijing, Shanteau invited CNN to spend time with him the night before his surgery in Atlanta, Georgia. Though admittedly a little scared, he spent the evening relaxing with his family, cooking dinner, walking the dog. A source of inspiration, he says, were fans who shared their stories of beating cancer. ""They send me their story and it helps me to learn that people are going through the same thing I am all over the world,"" says Shanteau. ""They all affect me in a different way and it's been really encouraging to share in this experience with other people."" Testicular cancer is diagnosed in about 1 in 300 men in their lifetime. It is the most common form of cancer for 15- to 34-year-olds. It is also one of the most curable if discovered early. Nearly 140,000 men in the United States are testicular cancer survivors. Shanteau says he experienced no symptoms of cancer and came across the tumor by chance. ""I've been in a Speedo half my life,"" he says. ""So I am really comfortable with my body. One day I just felt something that wasn't suppose to be there. I decided to go and get it checked out."" He adds that although he had the ""greatest excuse in the world"" -- an Olympic dream -- to ignore the lump, he understood the importance of early detection. Shanteau's father Rick, is battling lung cancer and responding well to treatment. ""A lot of guys, if they hear a rattle in their car, they're at the mechanic the next day,"" he says. ""But if they feel something [physically] that they don't think should be there, it takes them a year to get to their doctor and that just is not smart. There's really no excuse, because it can save your life."" Fast forward to Shanteau's recent operation at Emory University Hospital. CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta was with Shanteau during the surgery and spoke with the lead surgeon, Dr. Jeff Carney, moments afterward. ""I think the operation went very well,"" Carney said. ""Eric's a very healthy young man, very thin, in excellent shape. That makes my job easy."" Later that week, Shanteau's pathology results revealed that the operation removed the most of the cancer. ""The majority of it is gone."" he tells CNN. ""There is a small chance it could come back but I shouldn't need chemotherapy at this point, so I am really optimistic."" His treatment plan is to keep a close eye on his health for the next year with regular medical tests. ""Obviously, it would have been nice if the doctor said, 'You're completely in the clear,' but my results are exactly what the doctors expected."" Eric says the cancer diagnosis gave him a different perspective on life. ""I appreciate life much more now,"" he says. ""I don't let myself get upset about the little nitpicky things anymore. Food even seems to taste better. It is really great."" As for Shanteau's swimming career, he plans to compete in the 2009 World Swimming Championship in Rome, Italy. ""2012 [the next Olympics] is a push for me. Right now I'm just kind of taking it year by year and we'll see what happens.""","Olympic swimmer Eric Shanteau found out about his cancer in June .

"(CNN)  -- Manchester United came a goal behind and shrugged off the early loss of Michael Owen to injury to beat German champions Wolfsburg 2-1 for their second victory in Champions League Group B. Giggis is congratulated by teammates after scoring his 150th goal for United. Owen, looking to impress watching England manager Fabio Capello, survived for just 20 minutes at Old Trafford before going off with a groin strain. His replacement Dimitar Berbatov proved highly effective but the enterprising visitors went ahead through a Edin Dzeko header in the 56th minute. Ryan Giggs equalized just three minutes later with his 150th goal for the Red Devils, his deflected shot finding its way home. The evergreen Giggs then set up Michael Carrick for the 76th minute winner as he curled home his shot from the edge of the penalty area. United manager Alex Ferguson paid his own compliment to the Welsh wizard as he reflected on a hard-fought home victory. ""He's unbelievable, all the infinitives, all the praise over the years, I don't know if you can add to it. He's a marvellous player."" Ferguson also revealed that Owen would be out for between two to three weeks with his latest injury. The three points leave United top of the group with two wins from two games after their eighth victory in a row in all competitions. In the other Group B action on Wednesday, CSKA Moscow bounced back from their 2-1 defeat to Wolfsburg in the first round of matches to see off Turkish champions Besiktas 2-1. Midfielders Alan Dzagoev and Milos Krasic scored for the hosts either side of half time, with Besiktas, beaten in their first two games, pulling a goal back thorugh Ismail Koybasi. In Group A, the heavyweight clash between Bayern Munich and Juventus ended in a goalless draw. Munich had several chances in their home Allianz Arena, but failed to convert them although they do top the group with four points. French champions Bordeaux are in second place on three points after a 1-0 home win over Israeli counterparts Maccabi Haifa. Having drawn with Juventus in their group opener, Laurent Blanc's men had wait until the 83rd minute for a vital breakthrough as Michael Ciani headed home from Gregory Sertic's corner. Juventus are third in the group after two draws, with Maccabi bottom after drawing blank.","Manchester United beat VfL Wolfsburg 2-1 in Champions League Group B .

"(CNN) -- The civil warfare and social instability in Somalia have prompted the flight of more than 50,000 refugees to neighboring Kenya this year alone, the U.N. refugee agency said Friday. The Dadaab refugee complex is the largest of its kind in the world. Somalis are arriving at an average rate of 6,400 a month, and their presence has placed pressure on northern Kenya's Dadaab refugee complex -- bursting at the seams with three times the population it was built to hold. There are more than 281,000 Somali refugees there, and the UNHCR fears that heavy rains in Kenya will lead to flooding at the complex and pose ""considerable health risks to the refugees."" The International Organization of Migration has been working with the UNHCR, Kenyan authorities and non-governmental organizations to relocate refugees from Dadaab to the Kakuma camp in the northwestern part of the country. Somalia has been in turmoil for years. Clashes have raged between pro-government forces and rebel groups such as Al-Shabaab, the Islamist militia with ties to al Qaeda. And this fighting has prompted widespread displacement in the war-wracked nation. Al-Shabaab has been targeting the most prominent Western-linked entity in the capital, Mogadishu -- the African Union peacekeeping mission, the de facto military force of the weak, transitional Somali government. Fighting has forced about 250,000 Somalis out of their homes in Mogadishu since May and many of the displaced have sought refuge west of the capital in the Afgooye corridor, the U.N. agency said. Also, many Somalis have chosen to flee the country by traveling across the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea to Yemen or the Mediterranean Sea to Europe. Many have drowned or have gone missing in their journey.","More than 50,000 Somali refugees have entered Kenya since the beginning of 2009 .

"(CNN) -- The earthquake in Sichuan, southwestern China, last May left around 69,000 people dead and 15 million people displaced. Now ecologists have assessed the earthquake's impact on biodiversity and the habitat for some of the last existing wild giant pandas. Giant pandas are more endangered than ever since the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. According to the report published in ""Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment"", 23 percent of the pandas' habitat in the study area was destroyed, and fragmentation of the remaining habitat could hinder panda reproduction. The Sichuan region is designated as a global hotspot for biodiversity, according to Conservation International. Home to more than 12,000 species of plants and 1,122 species of vertebrates, the area includes more than half of the habitat for the Earth's wild giant panda population, said study lead author Weihua Xu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. ""We estimate that above 60 percent of the wild giant panda population was affected to some extent by the earthquake,"" said Xu in the report. In an effort to develop conservation strategies for the panda's remaining habitat, Xu and his colleagues used satellite imagery to determine the pandas' habitat loss and fragmentation in the South Minshan region, which is adjacent to the earthquake's epicenter. Since forests are the main vegetation type used by the pandas, the authors compared forested areas in satellite images from September 2007, before the earthquake, to images after the earthquake and its aftershocks, in July 2008. The authors then combined results based on these satellite data with criteria that make forests suitable for pandas, including elevation, slope incline and presence of bamboo. Their analyses revealed that more than 354 square kilometers, or about 23 percent, of the pandas' habitat was converted to bare land. Of the remaining habitat, the researchers found that large habitat areas had been fragmented into smaller, disconnected patches, which Xu says can be just as harmful as habitat destruction. ""It is probable that habitat fragmentation has separated the giant panda population inhabiting this region, which could be as low as 35 individuals,"" said Xu. ""This kind of isolation increases their risk of extinction in the wild, due in part to a higher likelihood of inbreeding."" Xu and his colleagues proposed a plan to encourage pandas to move between patches using specially protected corridors. They also recommend areas to be protected outside of nature reserves and that post-earthquake relocation of affected towns takes panda habitat into consideration. ""It is vital to the survival of this species that measures are taken to protect panda habitat outside nature reserves,"" said Xu. ""Giant pandas in this region are more vulnerable than ever to human disturbance, including post-earthquake reconstruction and tourism. When coupled with these increasing human activities, natural disasters create unprecedented challenges for biodiversity conservation.""","New report on affect of 2008 Sichuan earthquake on wild giant panda population .

"(CNN) -- Flash floods and landslides triggered by a weekend tropical storm have killed at least 100 people in Vietnam, the country's news agency said Monday. Vietnamese villagers look at the rubble where 19 houses stood before a flash-flood ripped away the hamlet of Tung Chin in Lao Cai province. Forecasters fear additional casualties as more rain was expected Monday. The floods in the the country's northern mountain provinces damaged tens of thousands of homes, swept away thousands of cattle and submerged crops, the Vietnam News Agency said. More than two dozen people remained missing. Officials mobilized thousands of rescue workers to look for survivors and to carry relief to the areas hardest hit by the storm. Tropical Storm Kammuri struck the northern provinces on Friday. The southeast Asian country is prone to heavy rainfall during the May through September monsoon season. The resulting landslides and floods have killed hundreds in past years.","Flash floods and landslides kill at least 100 people in Vietnam .

"DENVER, Colorado (CNN) -- Investigators in Colorado say they have broken up a massive methamphetamine ring in the Denver area that distributed pounds of the dangerous drug every week and laundered the profits using collectible comic books. Aaron Castro and his brother were the leaders of the methamphetamine ring, authorities say. ""To launder the money you have to use something that is quick and convenient,"" Colorado Attorney General John Suthers said at a news conference Monday. ""And in this case, they used classic comic books."" While arresting the alleged ringleaders, brothers Aaron and Alfonzo Castro, law enforcement officers seized about 100 boxes of first-edition collectible comic books. Investigators say one title alone is worth $3,500 and the total collection of comics is worth half a million dollars. ""It appeared they were working on a startup company for high-end comic books,"" said Don Quick, the district attorney in Adams County near Denver. Quick said the seized comic books included some first-edition Superman and Batman titles. The fragile, vintage comics were stored in plastic bags for protection. According to a grand jury indictment released Monday, the Castro brothers arranged for weekly, multiple-pound shipments of the meth from Phoenix, Arizona. The brothers then distributed the drugs to a network of runners that made deliveries to dealers around the Denver area. Suthers says Castro brothers sometimes used females ""as drug mules by having them hide methamphetamine inside their vaginal cavities."" These women would then deliver the meth to a series of houses, and then lower-level dealers would distribute the drug. ""It's a tawdry piece of information, but it's a big part of what this group was doing,"" he said. These same runners also collected money from dealers and delivered it to the Castro brothers. Suthers said the drugs most likely were manufactured in Mexico, and each month's shipments had a street value of about $2 million. The indictment details 145 drug possession and distribution charges from October 2008 to earlier this month. The Castros and 39 other people are listed as defendants. The Castro brothers and their top runners are also charged with racketeering. Of the 41 defendants, 40 are in custody. The Castros are being held in the Adams County jail on $1 million bail each. It is unclear if they have attorneys.","Colorado authorities say ring distributed pounds of meth each week .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Organization of American States suspended Honduras late Saturday because the nation's new leaders refused to reinstate ousted President Jose Manuel Zelaya. Ousted Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya appears Tuesday at the U.N. General Assembly. Zelaya was removed by the military on June 28 and flown to Costa Rica. Congressional leader Roberto Micheletti was sworn in as provisional president later that day. The OAS set a Saturday deadline for Honduras to return Zelaya to power or be suspended from the 35-nation hemispheric organization. Honduran officials told OAS Secretary General Jose Miguel Insulza on Friday that they would not allow Zelaya to return to power. Thousands of protesters demanding the return to power of ousted Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya pushed through riot police at Tegucigalpa's airport and surrounded the terminal Saturday, but there were no reports of violence. The airport continued to operate, CNN Correspondent Karl Penhaul reported. Zelaya, a leftist who took office in 2006, says he will return to Honduras on Sunday. Micheletti has vowed to have Zelaya arrested if he returns. ""I am simply defending a system,"" Zelaya told the OAS delegates early Sunday, after the 33-0 vote to suspend Honduras. Among the delegates were two heads of state: Presidents Christina Fernandez de Kirchner of Argentina and Fernando Lugo of Paraguay. ""I am here not only as president of the republic of Argentina, but also as part of a delegation who was the object of coups in Argentina,"" Fernandez said. Lugo also spoke in favor of restoring Zelaya and democracy to his nation. ""I come from Paraguay, a country that has had the long night of dictatorships,"" Lugo said. ""I come here with a pain, but also with a hope."" Micheletti repeated in an interview with CNN en Español on Saturday night that a coup did not take place. What happened, he said, was a constitutional transfer of power authorized by the nation's congress. But Micheletti is swimming against world opinion. The U.N. General Assembly condemned the coup last week and demanded that Zelaya be reinstated. The European Union and other nations have recalled their ambassadors from Honduras, and the United States and the World Bank have suspended some aid. Honduran officials have said the Central American nation was prepared to withdraw from the OAS rather than reinstate Zelaya. ""If the Organization of American States doesn't deem Honduras worthy of membership of the Organization of American States, then Honduras would renounce with immediate effect the inter-American charter,"" said Deputy Foreign Minister Marta Lorena Alvarado. At the center of the dispute was a referendum Zelaya had vowed to carry out even after the country's supreme court and congress found it illegal. The nonbinding referendum could have led to the creation of a constitutional assembly to modify the country's charter to allow the president to run for re-election. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, a Zelaya ally, won a similar referendum this year, and many Hondurans thought Zelaya was trying to maneuver a way to seek re-election in November. Zelaya has denied that was his intent. Zelaya narrowly won the presidency in 2005, with 49.8 percent of the vote to 46.1 percent for Porfirio ""Pepe"" Lobo. After 18 years of nearly uninterrupted military rule, Honduras returned to civilian control in 1981. Since then, the military has not seemed interested in holding power in the nation of more than 7 million people, about 70 percent of whom live in poverty. Military interventions were once common in Latin America, but civilian governments have held sway since the 1980s. Before Sunday, the only other barracks revolt this decade was an unsuccessful 2002 coup attempt against Chavez, when the military displaced him but backed down days later and allowed his reinstatement.

"LEONE, American Samoa (CNN) -- Another earthquake struck Wednesday near the Samoan islands, an area already devastated by earthquake and tsunami damage which killed more than 130 people. A traditional Samoan fale is destroyed Wednesday in the devastated village of Leone. The 5.5-magnitude earthquake occurred at 6:13 p.m. Wednesday evening (1:13 a.m. Thursday ET), according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The quake's epicenter was 10 km (6 miles) deep in the Pacific Ocean about 121 miles (194 km) from the city of Apia, Samoa. The quake did not trigger a tsunami warning, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. It followed an 8.0-magnitude earthquake which hit the small cluster of Samoan islands early Tuesday triggering a tsunami. At least 139 people are confirmed dead as a consequence of Tuesday's quake and tsunami. They include 22 people killed in American Samoa, 110 in Samoa and seven in Tonga, according to officials on the islands.

"(OPRAH.com) -- When I was a teen, I tried to read the entire Encyclopedia Britannica. My goal: Memorize its contents, be on TV game shows, win cash and prizes, run away from home, move to Manhattan and become a professional writer. Instead of focusing on getting Mr. Right, focus on finding Life Plan Right, says author. I got as far as Asparagus. To this day, I know a little about a lot of words beginning with ""A."" Some favorites: ants, atoms, alchemy. Plus, Aristotle was a childhood crush, because I've always loved philosophy. When I finished reading his one-page encyclopedic write-up, I bought books about him. I'd been saving these dog-eared, underlined Aristotle books, as well as the ""A"" book of Britannica, all to be used in a novel, where I'd been planning to bless my protagonist with the quirky detail of knowing all things ""A."" I recently rediscovered these Aristotle books when moving apartments. I flipped through and was surprised to discover Aristotle said a lot of the same things about love and happiness as modern psychologists. Only Aristotle obviously said it first, having been born at least 300 years B.C. Plus, Aristotle said it truly wisely. Indeed, much of what Aristotle said hit home big-time -- in particular about a sexy, smart, funny, rich, lying, cheating, don't-get-me-started Prince Harming I'd just broken up with. I could almost hear what Aristotle might say to me if we were to chat over souvlaki. 'Sold your soul to be with him' ""Mea bene, Karen,"" Aristotle would say. ""You know what your problem was with your ex? He was not your soul mate -- but your 'sold' mate -- because you sold your soul to be with him. Sure he was sexy, smart, rich, funny -- but alas, he was a liar and a cheat."" ""You're an intellectual guy."" I'd correct the regaled philosopher called the ""Mind of the Academy"" by Plato. ""I'm surprised you believe in something as namby-pamby metaphysical as a soul mate!"" Oprah.com: 10 rules to soul mate love . ""Absolutely!"" My fave Greek philosopher buddy Ari would respond emphatically. ""Actually, I sort of coined the concept of 'soul mate.' If there'd been a little TM trademark thingy back in the 300s B.C., I'd be a very rich man today. I firmly believe caretaking the soul is incredibly important for happiness. I describe a soul mate as a 'soul-nurturing mate.' Someone who nurtures your soul, thereby promoting insight and growth. I pushed folks to find soul mates because, in my opinion, real happiness only comes when you stimulate your core self -- and grow into your highest potential. Basically, the soul is the ultimate G-spot for happiness."" Of course, I'm paraphrasing for my philosopher buddy. But if Aristotle were here, I know he'd agree with my verbal modernization. Plus, Ari would go on to describe how he views the world as offering three kinds of relationships, only one of which brings true happiness. 3 kinds of relationships . According to ancient philosopher Aristotle, there are three kinds of relationships, only one of which will bring you true happiness. Find out how your relationship measures up! 1. Relationships of pleasure . Partners who are about sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. You share soulless, passionate sex and playful banter -- but they're about the body or ego. They never soul-nurture you with insight and growth, so they never bring real-deal happiness. Oprah.com: How to break your bad man habit . 2. Relationships of utility . Partners you spend time with in hopes of garnering status, power, money and beauty like the rich guy with a trophy girl. Again, this is about body or ego and doesn't bring true joy. 3. Relationships of shared virtue . Partners who challenge and inspire you to grow into your highest potential and nurture your soul. A good example is when Jack Nicholson's character in ""As Good As It Gets"" says, ""You make me want to be a better man."" When you prioritize seeking a partner who supports you becoming your best self -- instead of crushing on ""superficial lures""(hotness, funniness, smartness, success, etc.) -- you wind up with a soul mate/a Prince Charming/a definite keeper! With this in mind, if you want to be happy in love, you must take time to see past a guy's ""superficial lures"" and look inside his ""superinsidehimself."" Unfortunately, those fumes of chemistry can often dizzy a gal into making stupid love choices. That's why it's important to remember: Hot, steamy chemistry eventually fades -- and what's always left beneath is a person's true soul. Yes, if you want to be happy, you must seek a good-hearted, ethical soul who brings you great growth -- not simply a hottie who brings great grope Oprah.com: The best things to do for your relationship . Confession time: Another superficially alluring quality I've been suckered in by is humor. I am Silly Putty in a friggin' funny man's hands. I once had a boyfriend who teased me that the secret to getting me into bed was to crack five good jokes in a night. He'd count down his jokes as the night progressed. Unfortunately, funniness is a mere decorative quality -- sometimes developed to avoid talking about real-life issues. Which is why in the past, after a few months of dating a friggin' funny guy, I've witnessed all that fabulous ha-ha-ha laughter often gives way to tears when the guy's true character -- true soul -- shows up as one that avoids honest communication, warm empathy and the desire for growth. Then, when I try to connect soul to soul -- heart to heart -- I am greeted by a gigantic, unmovable whoopee cushion wall. Basically, friggin' funny is only the tiniest tip of a person. Meanwhile, a person's soul is a person's foundation! For the record: Aristotle wasn't against finding someone friggin' funny or friggin' sexy or friggin' rich. He believed these pleasure-bringing qualities were good for stirring up passion, which humans need to be our fullest selves! But Aristotle recognized ""superficial lures"" and material goods were simply what he called ""means to the ends"" of happiness, not ""the final ends,"" which is always to grow into your most esteemed self. As Aristotle said: ""Men imagine the causes of happiness lie in external goods. That is as if they were to ascribe fine and beautiful lyre playing to the quality of the instrument rather than the skill of the player."" Or as I like to say, ""It's just as easy to complain about a rich man as it is to complain about a poor man."" Basically, it doesn't matter how rich a guy is if his behavior makes you twitchy and miserable. While on the subject of money, Aristotle was no fan of slackers either. He recognized that being or dating poor brought its share of problems. He even admitted the lack of a certain amount of wealth was as much an obstacle to happiness as deprivation of freedom. He gladly accepted that some wealth was needed to be happy -- just as exciting bodily pleasures were needed. But again, wealth and bodily pleasures were mere means to the ends of happiness -- these ultimate ends being to nourish your soul, so you can reach your most esteemed level of self. A big secret to happiness? Stop focusing on finding a Mr. Right! Start focusing on finding Life Plan Right. When a Mr. Potential Right comes along, you must ask yourself if this guy will lead you to Life Plan Right or Life Plan Wrong. As you get to know the guy, look to see if he: . 1. Offers you exciting growth as well as exciting grope . 2. Has developed good character -- so he'll be a positive influence on your character development. If the guy scores two for two, you're likely in Prince Charming territory. Oprah.com: What you could learn from dating 100 men .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- The Iraqi government said Friday it has arrested members of a cell believed responsible for Wednesday's truck bombings in which more than 100 people were killed. Workers clear the site outside the ministries of Finance and Foreign Affairs in Baghdad. Maj. Gen. Qassim Atta, spokesman for Baghdad Operations Command, appeared on Iraqi state television Friday night to announce the arrests, which he said were made within two hours of the bombings in the capital city. Those arrested include people believed to have planned and executed the attacks, Atta said. It was not immediately clear how many people were arrested. Initial investigations show a link between the cell and the ousted Baath regime of Saddam Hussein, Atta said. Authorities are also seeking people thought to have provided cell members with logistical support and identification, he said. Iraq Security Forces recovered a truck Friday with five tons of C-4 explosives in the Abu Ghraib area, on the western outskirts of Baghdad, Atta said Friday night. More than 500 people were wounded Wednesday in the six explosions in Baghdad. In one attack, a truck bomb exploded outside the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The blast blew through the front of the building, sending some vehicles flying and leaving others in mangled twists of metal in the area, which is just outside the restricted International Zone, also known as the Green Zone. Another truck bomb went off outside the Ministry of Finance building. Authorities said Thursday that 11 high-ranking security officials from the Iraqi army and police were detained for investigation. The Iraqi government in the past has made claims of arrests that did not hold up. In April, it said it had captured Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, the head of al Qaeda in Iraq's umbrella group, the Islamic State of Iraq. The Islamic State of Iraq denied it, and the capture was never confirmed by the U.S. military. The explosions made Wednesday the country's deadliest day since the United States pulled its combat troops from Iraqi cities and towns nearly two months ago and left security in the hands of the Iraqis. The U.S. military remains in a training and advisory capacity in those areas and continues to conduct combat operations outside cities and towns. Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki ordered increased security measures, including more checkpoints and more stringent vehicle searches across the capital, government officials said on Thursday. The Iraqi government has been trying to restore what it described as normalcy to the streets of the capital in recent weeks. Al-Maliki ordered his government to take down within 40 days the concrete blast walls that line Baghdad's streets and protected neighborhoods at the height of the war. Many Iraqis have criticized the move as premature.","Wednesday bombings of Finance, Foreign Affairs ministries killed more than 100 .

"(Mental Floss) -- In his victory speech on Tuesday night, Barack Obama promised his daughters Sasha and Malia that they'd get to bring a new puppy with them to the White House in January. President Bush's dog Barney, left, plays in 2001 with Spot, the offspring of George H.W. Bush's dog Millie. It's a good thing Obama said ""Yes, we can"" to the girls' request to getting a dog; for all of his charm, ability, and oratorical flair, he could never be our nation's chief executive without a White House pet. Counting Obama, the country has had 44 Presidents, and only two of them -- Chester A. Arthur and Franklin Pierce -- left no record of having pets. Like Obama himself, the family pooch will have some big shoes to fill. Previous White House pets have set the bar pretty high. iReport.com: What pet would you want if you lived in the White House? Here are a few of our favorites:  Watch Obama on ""mutts like me"" » . 1. Billy: Calvin Coolidge's pygmy hippopotamus . Calvin Coolidge may have been known for his reticence, but he showed little of his trademark reserve when it came to acquiring pets. After taking over the presidency upon the death of Warren G. Harding, Coolidge assembled a menagerie that would rival most zoos' collections. He had six dogs, a bobcat, a goose, a donkey, a cat, two lion cubs, an antelope, and a wallaby. The main attraction in his personal zoo, though, was Billy, a pygmy hippopotamus.  Watch new baby pygmy hippo » . Billy was born in Liberia, but was captured at a young age. He came into the possession of tire mogul Harvey Firestone, who gave Billy to President Coolidge as a gift, possibly because Firestone didn't want to feed the critter. (Even a pygmy hippo is still quite rotund; Billy was six feet long and weighed upwards of 600 pounds.) Coolidge donated Billy to the Smithsonian National Zoological Park. Because there were only a handful of pygmy hippos in the U.S. at the time, Billy quickly went to work as a stud, an endeavor at which he found some success. He sired 23 little hippos, and many of the pygmy hippos you see in American zoos today are his offspring. Mental Floss: 7 crafty zoo escapes . 2. The White House gators . Herbert Hoover wanted to put a chicken in every pot, a car in every garage, and ... a gator in the Oval Office? It's true. Hoover owned a slew of dogs, but those weren't his only pets. His second son, Allan Henry Hoover, owned a pair of gators that were occasionally allowed to wander around the White House grounds. Sound crazy? Blame John Quincy Adams for setting the precedent. The sixth president also had a pet gator. His was a gift from the Marquis de Lafayette; it lived in a bathroom in the East Room of the White House. According to some reports, he enjoyed using the gator to scare his guests. 3. Fala: FDR's traveling companion . What do you get the Depression-conquering president who has everything? A lapdog. In 1940 Franklin Roosevelt received a Scottish Terrier puppy named Big Boy as an early Christmas gift from a family friend. FDR immediately realized that Big Boy was no name for a presidential companion and rechristened the pooch Murray the Outlaw of Falahill, after a Scottish ancestor. For the sake of simplicity, though, he called his new pal Fala. After that, Fala became FDR's inseparable companion and traveled everywhere the President went. The dog ""gave"" $1 a day to the war effort, generosity that earned him the rank of honorary private in the Army. Each morning when FDR's breakfast tray came in, it included a bone for Fala. Fala also made a famous appearance in one of his master's speeches. When FDR was decrying personal attacks from his political opponents, he jokingly said that it was okay to mock him, but leave Fala alone. ""You know, Fala is Scotch, and being a Scottie, as soon as he learned that the Republican fiction writers in Congress and out had concocted a story that I had left him behind on the Aleutian Islands and had sent a destroyer back to find him -- at a cost to the taxpayers of two or three, or eight or 20 million dollars -- his Scotch soul was furious. ""He has not been the same dog since!"" Fala stayed with FDR until the President's death in 1945 and lived in the care of Eleanor Roosevelt until his death in 1952. Mental Floss: 6 utterly loyal dogs . 4. Millie: Literary sensation . When George H.W. Bush took office in 1989, he brought his pet springer spaniel Millie to the White House. The bubbly canine won over the nation's heart so completely that she even collaborated with the First Lady on Millie's Book: As Dictated to Barbara Bush. Millie brought further joy to the Bush family when she gave birth to a litter of six presidential puppies in 1989. Just as her master helped slip one of his boys into the White House, so did Millie: when George W. Bush moved into the Oval Office, so did his dog, Millie's son Spot Fetcher. 5. Barney, Miss Beazley & India: The current residents . Sadly, Spot Fetcher had to be put down in 2004, but the Bushes aren't pet-deprived now. They have a pair of Scottish Terriers named Barney and Miss Beazley, both of whom have websites and appear in White House-produced web videos. (Your tax dollars adorably at work!) The Bushes also have a black cat named India, who also goes by ""Willie.""  Watch Barney bite a reporter » . The name India rankled some citizens of the country of the same name to the point that many Indians supposedly named their dogs ""Bush."" The name wasn't meant to be controversial, though; the Bushes merely named their cat after Ruben ""El Indio"" Sierra, who played for the Texas Rangers while George W. owned the team. Spot Fetcher was similarly named after former Rangers middle infielder Scott Fletcher. Other first pets of note: . Mr. Reciprocity and Mr. Protection -- Benjamin Harrison's two opossums. Harrison's son Russell also had a pet goat named Old Whiskers. Pauline -- The last cow to live at the White House. She made milk for President Taft's consumption. Old Ike -- To save cash during World War I, Woodrow Wilson brought in a flock of sheep to take care of the White House's groundskeeping duties. Old Ike, a ram, supposedly chewed tobacco. Laddie Boy -- Warren G. Harding's beloved Airedale who had his own seat at Cabinet meetings and gave a 1921 ""interview"" with The Washington Post in which he talked about Prohibition and shortening the workday for guard dogs. Liberty -- Gerald Ford's golden retriever hung out in the Oval Office and could supposedly read a sign from Ford that she should go be affectionate to guests -- a cute and cuddly way to gracefully end the President's conversations. Socks and Buddy -- President Clinton's faithful cat and the chocolate lab he acquired while in office. Socks didn't like Buddy's youthful friendliness, so the two pets had to be kept separated at all times. The tensions were so bad that the family couldn't keep both pets at the end of Bill's second term, so Socks went to live with Clinton's secretary, Betty Currie. Gamecocks -- Ulysses S. Grant supposedly kept some gamecocks at the White House. Two tiger cubs -- Martin Van Buren received the cats as a gift from the Sultan of Oman. Congress supposedly made him give the gift to a zoo. Satan -- One of Abigail Adams' unfortunately named dogs. She called the other one Juno. Jonathan Edwards -- Theodore Roosevelt received this black bear cub as a gift from supporters in West Virginia who gave the bear the name, he wrote to a friend, ""partly because they thought they detected Calvinistic traits in the bear's character."" Dr. Johnson, Bishop Doane, Fighting Bob Evans, and Father O'Grady -- Teddy Roosevelt's kids also had these tremendously named guinea pigs. Josiah -- Roosevelt also had a pet badger, of course. Bonus trivia: Checkers . Nixon's dog was immortalized in the ""Checkers speech,"" which Nixon gave while facing allegations of illegal campaign contributions. He said the only gift he'd accepted was a cocker spaniel named Checkers for his daughters. Mental Floss: Why was the 'Checkers speech' so important? Checkers, however, was never the White House dog. This scandal bubbled up while Nixon was Eisenhower's running mate in the 1952 election, and Nixon gave the Checkers speech to convince Republicans to keep him on the ticket. Although the speech was a success and Nixon later made it to the White House, Checkers never got to be First Dog; he passed away in 1964. For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

"LAS VEGAS, Nevada (CNN) -- Christina Aguilar sits in a converted storage room of a Las Vegas medical center, the best hope for underinsured cancer patients to get the treatment they need. Christina Aguilar, 28, is being treated for advanced-stage ovarian cancer in Nevada. Drip by drip, Aguilar, 28, watches as chemo enters her body to fight advanced-stage ovarian cancer. She is here because her insurance company wouldn't pay for her chemotherapy or her surgeries. ""I thought, 'Why am I getting insurance if it's not going to pay for the most important thing?' "" she says, recalling the day she learned her insurance wouldn't cover treatment. Getting chemo in an old storage space isn't the most ideal situation, but it's her only choice.  Watch chemo in a closet » . Earlier this year, state budget cuts in Nevada resulted in the slashing of the outpatient cancer center at the University Medical Center's oncology clinic, forcing patients to find treatment on their own. ""We're supposed to be the safety net for patients, and yet obviously the safety net has holes in it,"" says Kathleen Silver, the CEO of University Medical Center. Oncologist Nick Spirtos found a solution. He persuaded his partners to take on the patients pro bono, converted a storage area in his office into a chemotherapy room and got Clark County to pay for the expensive chemo drugs. One treatment can cost upwards of $10,000. He's also sought more primitive ways to cover costs. He holds up a clear plastic box bearing the label ""Cash for Chemotherapy."" Dollar bills and loose change jingle. There are 380 boxes placed throughout the county. ""It helps,"" says Spirtos, the director of the Women's Cancer Center of Nevada. ""If these boxes pay for one more patient's chemo, that's one lady who in the overall context wouldn't be able to have her treatment."" With the nation debating health care reform, Spirtos says he does favor universal health care, but not without trepidation.  Learn more about America's health care debate » . He says Medicaid reimburses doctors at a fraction of their costs, and he believes other government programs are poorly run. He wrote an open letter to President Obama and Congress earlier this month. ""[I] respectfully suggest that instead of rushing headlong into ill-thought out proposals, you and your staff along with Congress take some time and thoughtfully review the issues facing us and formulate a plan that might actually meet our needs,"" Spirtos said. But on this day, he's focused on his patients. Decked out in a blue doctor's gown, Spirtos makes the rounds to see the women at his clinic. Aguilar's ovaries were recently removed and she is getting her latest chemo regimen. She's reclined in a chair, a red blanket draped over her legs. She opens a laptop and flips through digital pictures of her mother, who died of lymphatic cancer 10 years ago. Aguilar says her cancer was detected almost by accident. She went in for a checkup and a small acorn-sized cyst was discovered. A month later, it was the size of a grapefruit. She broke down in tears just after her ovaries were removed. ""I started crying. I was like, 'Oh my God, I'm not going to be able to have kids,' "" she says. Aguilar was a cashier at Toys R Us, making $8.76 an hour. She had insurance through work, but it wouldn't cover her costs. Her salary made her inelgible for Medicaid. With the slashing of the county hospital's oncology unit, her bills were racking up and she had few options. Luckily, her doctor referred her to Spirtos. Spirtos says cases like hers are becoming all too common, especially in the down economy. He treats 75 to 85 women per month; about 20 percent are in a similar situation as Aguilar. ""If you're recently unemployed, you have no insurance benefits and you don't qualify for any of the public aids,"" he says. ""So amazingly, the people who've been working and supporting the system, the moment they're out of work they don't fit in any of the round holes -- they're square pegs."" If Aguilar wasn't getting treatment from him, he says, ""Over time, her cancer would progress and she'd pass away."" The doctor, who is bald, stops at her side. Aguilar rubs the doctor's golden dome. ""The great part about this is Christina's hair is going to grow back and mine won't,"" he says. The two laugh and smile. Outside the room, the doctor says he's doing all he can to make sure the women who come to him have the best treatment possible. ""I get to hug my patients, I get my head rubbed and I get an incredible amount of gratification,"" he says. He pauses. ""Getting a hug from one of these ladies is like my kids running up and saying, 'I love you.'"" He turns and walks down the hall. More patients await his help.

"ATHENS, Greece (CNN)   -- Fires in southern Greece that have razed dozens of villages and killed at least 44 people may have been deliberately set ahead of next month's national elections, the prime minister suggested Saturday. A fire burns in the Mesohoria area on Evia Island, northeast of Athens. Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis declared a nationwide state of emergency Saturday night. He also turned to European Union allies, which have promised help. Emergency crews pulled charred bodies from homes and local media reported death tolls of up to 50 people. Scores are hospitalized with severe burns and respiratory problems, state-run television reported. Although the fires were concentrated in the southern Peloponnese region, heavy smoke billowing Saturday afternoon above Mount Hymettus, southeast of Athens, signaled a new fire. It was burning close to Athens International Airport, forcing officials to close a highway. In a nationally televised address, Karamanlis suggested the blazes might have been set by political extremists, disrupting political campaigning. ""So many fires sparked simultaneously in so many places is no coincidence,"" Karamanlis said, and vowed to punish those responsible. Many firefighters told CNN they are suspicious of the fire's source, given several witness reports that the blazes cropped up simultaneously along a 20-kilometer (12-mile) front of lush greenery in southern Greece. The prime minister described the situation as a ""battle that has to be won,"" and ordered all resources mobilized to fight the fires. He also announced that a fund has been set up for fire victims and their families, and an assessment of the disaster will be made. The most devastated area stretches for 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the western towns of the Zaharo, within the highlands of the western Peloponnese, to the southern tip of the peninsula, Mani. In the past 24 hours, hundreds of firefighters, soldiers, and planes loaded with water have been battling the infernos on a dozen fronts, authorities said. Yet, despite their efforts, officials said the flames had not been tamed. ""Our emergency services are overstretched and it is humanly impossible to battle this force of nature,"" a top fire official told CNN. An EU statement said 30 member countries had offered assistance. France on Saturday was slated to send two planes to help quell the fires, and Norway and Germany pledged to send aircraft as well. A sweltering heat wave in Greece has parched  forests and scrubland. With intense winds fanning the flames, authorities call this the country's worst fire season on record. Since June, more than 3,000 fires have razed thousands of hectares of forests and scrubland across the country -- nearly triple last year's total -- according to officials. A mother, her child and at least seven other people died fleeing burning woods in the mountainous villages in western Peloponnese, near the town of Zaharo, according to a fire department official. Farther south, six people -- including two French tourists found by rescue crews in an embrace -- were killed in a forest fire that swept near their hotel in the town of Areopolis, located 190 kilometers (120 miles) southwest of Athens. Greece's elections are set for September 16. The ruling party has called for a temporary suspension of political campaigning as a sign of respect to those who died in the flames, and flags on government buildings were flying Saturday at half staff.

"BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Services for Sen. Edward Kennedy will be Saturday morning at a Boston church before his burial in Arlington National Cemetery outside Washington, his office announced Wednesday. Sen. Ted Kennedy's funeral is scheduled for Saturday in Boston, Massachusetts, at the Mission Church. President Obama, who called Kennedy an ""extraordinary leader,"" will deliver a eulogy at the funeral, according to several sources. Kennedy died Tuesday night at his home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, after being ill for 15 months with brain cancer. He was 77. Obama, on vacation at Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, said Wednesday that Americans knew Kennedy's death was coming for some time, but have been ""awaiting it with no small amount of dread."" ""The outpouring of love, gratitude and fond memories to which we've all borne witness is a testament to the way this singular figure in American history touched so many lives,"" Obama said. ""His ideas and ideals are stamped on scores of laws and reflected in millions of lives -- in seniors who know new dignity; in families that know new opportunity; in children who know education's promise; and in all who can pursue their dream in an America that is more equal and more just, including myself."" The ""extraordinary good that he did lives on,"" Obama said. Before the funeral, Kennedy's body will lie in repose Thursday afternoon and Friday in the Smith Center at the John F.

Kennedy is eligible for burial at Arlington because of his congressional service and his tenure in the Army from 1951 to 1953. Army officials and members of Kennedy's staff met at the cemetery a few weeks ago to discuss a plan for the burial, an official said. The plan was then given to the family by staff members. The proposed grave site is 95 feet south of the grave of Sen. Robert Kennedy, the official said. Robert Kennedy's grave is, in turn, just steps away from the grave of their brother, President John F. Kennedy. The plot of land is currently covered with grass. At this point, U.S. military ceremonial units have not received orders for participating in a funeral, but military sources said a typical congressional funeral would include military personnel at the internment, a military team to carry the casket, a firing party for a gun salute and a bugler. Any arrangements will depend on the family's wishes. CNN's Barbara Starr, John King and Alec Miran contributed to this report.","President Obama calls Sen. Ted Kennedy an ""extraordinary leader""

"SEATTLE, Washington (CNN)  -- Software giant Microsoft apologized Wednesday for the apparent bad judgment that led to the head of a black model being swapped for that of a white model in an online advertisement. A black man in an online Microsoft ad was replaced with a white man, bottom, on the company's Polish Web site. The ad -- which showed three business people, one Asian, one white and one black -- was altered on Microsoft's Web site for Poland to place the head of a white man on a black man's body.

""As it is impossible for the country to abolish capital punishment under current realities and social security conditions, it is an important effort to strictly control the application of the penalty by judicial organs,"" Zhang Jun, vice president of the Supreme People's Court, said in an interview with Legal Daily, the state-run China Daily reported. ""Judicial departments should use the least number of death sentences as possible, and death penalties should not be given to those having a reason for not being executed,"" Zhang said. Legislation will be enacted to restrict the number of death sentences imposed and the court will tighten restrictions on the use of capital punishment, according to Zhang. The sentence of ""death penalty with reprieve"" will be used more often in courts, Zhang said, which could be commuted to life in prison. The term could later be shortened to 20 years and possibly reduced further for good behavior. China will retain the death sentence, according to Zhang, adding that it should be applied to ""an extremely small number"" of serious offenders. Human rights groups estimate 1,700 to 5,000 people were executed in China last year for crimes such as spying, corruption and drug trafficking. The official number of executions is a state secret. The death penalty remains an iconic form of punishment in China, where executions are used as a public warning. Sentencing is broadcast on national television. Two years ago, however, the Supreme Court was given the authority to review death penalty cases and, last year, 10 percent of death sentences were overturned. Criminals who've expressed remorse or agreed to compensate victims' families have had their sentences reduced. The death penalty will now be reserved for those who commit heinous crimes with ""grave social consequences,"" the government said. It's a step in the right direction, China analysts say. But they criticize the move as being too ambiguous and remain skeptical that it will lead to an actual reduction in executions. ""This is a small incremental step, but a step in the right direction,"" said Victor Gao, a director of the China National Association of International Studies. ""While other countries have abolished the death penalty because they think it is cruel and unusual punishment, China has decided it wants to keep the death penalty."" Crimes with ""grave social consequences"" is a ""broad, catch-all concept which can be interpreted flexibly,"" Gao said. CNN's Emily Chang contributed to this report.","Government: Execution only for heinous crimes with ""grave social consequences""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Carrie Prejean's lawyer gave Miss California USA executive director Keith Lewis what he said was a final warning to retract statements made about the former beauty queen or face a defamation lawsuit. The lawyer for former Miss California USA Carrie Prejean, says the ousted beauty queen's good name is ""tarnished."" Prejean, stripped of the Miss California USA title last week, ""suffered severe emotional distress"" and her reputation was harmed by Lewis, Charles LiMandri said in a letter sent Thursday to Lewis' lawyer. LiMandri's letter also accused Lewis, whom he referred to as a ""gay activist,"" of setting Prejean up to be fired because of her statements opposing same-sex marriage. When Prejean, 22, was dethroned, Lewis said it was for ""contract violations,"" including missed public appearances. He told CNN's Larry King last week that it wasn't one thing Prejean did, but ""many, many, many things."" ""She came to us and said I'm not interested in your input; I'll make my own decision what I'm going to do,"" Lewis said. ""You know, when you have a contract, when you're working for someone, you have a responsibility to follow through on what that requirement is."" Lewis told King it was clear ""she was not interested in upholding the title or the responsibilities."" ""Carrie Prejean's good name has been tarnished by your client's false and defamatory accusations,"" the letter from her lawyer to Lewis' said. ""Please view this letter as a last opportunity for Mr. Lewis to retract the defamatory statements made against my client and to seek to restore her good name,"" LiMandri said. ""If he does not comply, I will have no alternative but to recommend that Ms. Prejean proceed to do so through litigation."" In response to the letter, Lewis issued a statement that said: ""Mr. LiMandri obviously has never watched 'The Apprentice' if he believes that Mr. Trump could be so easily fooled. Facts are facts, and we stand by them."" LiMandri denied any contract violations, saying it was a ""complete and utter pretext"" for her firing. The list Lewis gave to reporters of Prejean's missed appearances was ""an outright fraud,"" he said. Prejean ""did not refuse reasonable appearance requests"" that could ""be expected to promote and further the intended purposes of Miss California USA,"" he said. The beauty queen expected to be asked to attend ""Rotary conventions and avocado festivals,"" not events Lewis suggested, LiMandri said. ""She did not think it was appropriate for her to accept Mr. Lewis' invitation to attend a gay documentary in Hollywood promoting same-sex marriage,"" he said. ""It was not my client's job, as Miss California, simply to help your client promote his personal or business interests as a Hollywood agent and producer, or gay activist."" He accused Lewis of trying to make commissions off Prejean's appearances. ""Your client was trying to wrongfully profit off of my client's participation as Miss California, in violation of her contract, by taking 20 percent of any appearance fee she would earn, such as at the Las Vegas jewelers convention she attended at his request,"" LiMandri's letter said. LiMandri cited a statement he said Lewis made during a May 15 conference call that ""clearly shows that your client was trying to 'set-up' our client for termination"" by relaying an offer to appear semi-nude in Playboy. Three people who worked for a public relations agency representing Prejean at the time heard it, he said. ""All three of those people distinctly remember Keith Lewis talking about sending Ms. Prejean an offer to do a Playboy photo shoot 'so when they take her title away, she doesn't sue me,' "" he said. LiMandri said Lewis -- and former co-executive director Shanna Moakler -- were ""bound and determined to get her fired, and they have now finally gotten their way."" Miss USA pageant owner Donald Trump announced last month that Prejean could keep her title despite a controversy over topless photos, missed appearances and her statements against same-sex marriage. Trump reversed himself last week. ""I told Carrie she needed to get back to work and honor her contract with the Miss California USA organization, and I gave her the opportunity to do so,"" Trump said. ""Unfortunately, it just doesn't look like it is going to happen, and I offered Keith my full support in making this decision.""","NEW: Pagaent director responds, ""Facts are facts, and we stand by them""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- While authorities do not yet know what killed Michael Jackson, the possibility that anesthetics -- particularly the drug Diprivan -- might be involved continues to swell with each new revelation. Propofol induces a coma, not sleep, an anesthesiologist told CNN. On Friday, The Associated Press quoted an unnamed law enforcement source saying investigators found Diprivan in Jackson's Holmby Hills home. A nutritionist, Cherilyn Lee, said earlier in the week that Jackson pleaded for the drug despite being told of its harmful effects. Sources close to Jackson told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta that the singer, who suffered from a sleep disorder, traveled with an anesthesiologist who would ""take him down"" at night and ""bring him back up"" during a world tour in the mid-90s. The California State Attorney General's office has now said it is helping the Los Angeles Police Department in Jackson's death investigation. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration is also looking into the role of drugs, two federal law enforcement sources said. The drug Diprivan, known by its generic name Propofol, is administered intravenously in operating rooms as a general anesthetic, the manufacturer AstraZeneca said Friday. ""It is neither indicated nor approved for use as a sleep aid,"" said spokesman Tony Jewell. The drug works as a depressant on one's central nervous system. ""It works on your brain,"" said Dr. Zeev Kain, the chair of the anesthesiology department at the University of California Irvine. ""It basically puts the entire brain to sleep."" However, once the infusion is stopped, the patient wakes up almost immediately. ""So if you're going to do this, you'd have to have somebody right there giving you the medication and monitoring you continuously,"" Kain said. Dr. Hector Vila, chairman of the Ambulatory Surgery Committee for the American Society of Anesthesiologists, said he administers the drug during office procedures such as urology, dentistry and gynecology. It is also the most common anesthetic for colonoscopies, he said. Both doctors said that while they have heard of the drug being abused by health care professionals, who have ready access to it, they had not heard of it being used as a sleep aid medication. ""Propofol induces coma, it does not induce sleep,"" Kain said. ""I can put you in a coma for as many days as you want. And, in fact, in intensive care units who have patients who are on a ventilator, that's one of the drugs they use."" Dr. Rakesh Marwah, of the anesthesiology department at the Stanford University School of Medicine, said the drug can lead to cardiac arrest without proper monitoring. ""Propofol slows down the heart rate and slows down the respiratory rate and slows down the vital functions of the body,"" he said. Not enough carbon dioxide exits the body; not enough oxygen enters. And the situation can cause the heart to abruptly stop. ""[It is] as dangerous as it comes,"" Kain said. ""You will die if you will give yourself, or if somebody will give you, Propofol and you're not in the proper medical hands."" Los Angeles police have interviewed Jackson's cardiologist, Dr. Conrad Murray, who apparently tried to revive the singer after he was found unconscious on June 25. They also impounded Murray's car, saying it might contain evidence -- possibly prescription medications. Police did not say whether they found anything. Through his lawyers, Murray has released several statements saying that he would not be commenting until the toxicology results into Jackson's death are released. The tests are due back in two to three weeks, the Los Angeles County coroner said Thursday. ""We are treating all unnamed sources as rumors. And, as we have stated before, we will not be responding to rumors or innuendo,"" Murray's lawyer, Matt Alford said Friday. ""We are awaiting the facts to come out and we will respond at that time. "" The anesthesiologist who accompanied Jackson during the HIStory tour in the mid-'90s also refused to comment, although he acknowledged Jackson suffered from a sleep disorder. ""I'm very upset. I'm distraught. Michael was a good person. I can't talk about it right now,"" Dr. Neil Ratner said outside his Woodstock, New York, home Thursday. ""It's really something I don't want to talk about right now. I lost a good friend."" On Thursday, the California State Attorney General's Office said it will assist Los Angeles police in sifting through information in a state database that monitors controlled medication. The database, known as CURES (Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System), contains an estimated 86 million records that list all doctors who prescribe such medication, the amount, the date and the person who receives it. Authorities said the database was used in the investigation after the death of former model and reality TV show star Anna Nicole Smith. A day earlier, federal law enforcement sources said DEA agents would be looking at various doctors involved with Jackson, their practices and their possible sources of medicine supply. A number of people close to Jackson have expressed concern that medication could have contributed to the singer's death at age 50. In 2005, after he was cleared on charges of child molestation, Jackson spent a week at a center run by Dr. Deepak Chopra, a physician who focuses on spirituality and the mind-body connection. During that week, Jackson asked Chopra for a prescription for a narcotic, the doctor said. ""I said, 'What the heck do you want a narcotic prescription for?'"" Chopra said. ""And it suddenly dawned on me that he was probably taking these and that he had probably a number of doctors who were giving him these prescriptions, so I confronted him with that. At first, he denied it. Then, he said he was in a lot of pain."" Brian Oxman, a former attorney for the Jackson family who was with the family in the hospital emergency room on June 25, also expressed concern about medications the pop star was taking. ""I talked to his family about it, I warned them -- I said that Michael is overmedicating and that I did not want to see this kind of a case develop,"" Oxman told CNN the next day. Earlier this week, the nutritionist Lee, a registered nurse, said Jackson suffered from severe bouts of insomnia and asked her to find him some Diprivan. ""I told him this medication is not safe,"" Lee said. ""He said, 'I just want to get some sleep. You don't understand. I just want to be able to be knocked out and go to sleep.' "" Lee, however, said she did not know of any doctors who would have given Jackson the drug nor had she seen him use it. CNN's Danielle Dellorto and Elizabeth Landau in Atlanta, Georgia, and Drew Griffin in Los Angeles, California, contributed to this report.","Anesthesiologist: Diprivan ""as dangerous as it comes,"" without proper guidance .

"(Tribune Media Services) -- Ahh! Ohh! Spa time at the Hawks Cay Resort in Florida . I'm face down on a massage table looking through glass at fish swimming in the lagoon, as the Polynesian masseuse caresses me with bags of seaweed and creams made from ground pearls and deep-sea water. Polynesian music plays softly. Waves lap the shore. Can it get any better than this? We're at the Thalasso Spa at the InterContinental Bora Bora Resort, which I'm told is the largest spa in French Polynesia, the first in the world to use water drawn from deep in the Pacific, which they tell us is extremely pure and rich in minerals. It's just an average mom-and-daughter afternoon together, or once in a lifetime, in this case. My friend, Pam Roza, her daughter, Orlee, my daughter, Mel, and their two friends, Margaret Bylsma and Lane Washburn -- all newly minted high school grads -- have taken an afternoon off from sailing on our chartered catamaran to enjoy a little spa action, followed by a real shower. The two dads have declined our invitation to join us and are snoozing by the pool at the resort. As if the massage isn't enough, we luxuriate in a walk-through pool that pummels our legs with jets of water. There are also treatments with deep-sea water showers, baths with deep-sea water and hydro massages, marine scrubs and mud treatments ... too bad we only have an afternoon! Of course, my mom never took me to a spa -- I don't think she's ever been to one herself -- but I've taken my wilderness-loving daughters to spas from the Caribbean to Colorado, from Arizona to Austria from the time they were young teens, and like others their age, they are perfectly at home getting facials and massages (as long as mom's paying). It turns out they've got plenty of company. According to the International Spa Association, 4 million teens have been to a spa. More than half of the hotel resort spas with memberships in ISA now have teen programs, and new ones that include younger children are opening all the time. An increasing number of resorts have dedicated spaces just for kids and teens -- from Scoops Kid Spas at the 10 Great Wolf Lodges around the country (choose your own sherbet scrub) to the Wild Hare Youth Spa at the Hyatt Regency Lost Pines Resort in Texas where you can create your own lip gloss. The teen spa area at Loews Coronado Bay Resort, designed with Pottery Barn PBTeen, offers young spa goers a chance to play video games or watch DVDs while they wait for their special acne facials, sports massages or skincare lessons. The Homestead in Hot Springs, Virginia, meanwhile, advertises treatments suitable for several ""generations"" of your family, while the Tabacon Grand Spa Thermal Resort in Costa Rica has a family spa bungalow that a family can use for an entire day, scheduling alternating treatments with dips in the river. ""Teens we see are experienced spa-goers,"" said Pat Liberto, manager at the Cloister Spa at Sea Island, Georgia. ""The younger children who have older spa-goer siblings want to try something too."" (You'll find junior spa programs in cities (Trump International Hotel in Chicago), at ski resorts (The Sundance Resort in Utah), in Florida (Hawks Cay Island Resort) and Hawaii (Grand Hyatt Kauai), in Williamsburg, Virginia (Kingsmill Resort and Spa), where birthday party spa camps are all the rage and even on Royal Caribbean and Carnival cruise ships. And the Four Seasons Bora Bora, which is making a huge effort to attract the family market, is developing an entire teen program to add to their special treatments for honeymooning couples. This pampering won't necessarily break the bank either, since many ""treatments,"" especially for younger kids, are substantially discounted. The spa treatments at Orlando's Nick Hotel start at just $6. Solace Spa at Boyne Mountain Resort in Michigan now hosts Family Nights with mini treatments. Admission is just $5 and includes yoga, steam, sauna and mini-treatments for as little as $10. ""At the age of six, it's not often you get to be a princess for an evening and receive royal treatments,"" said Danielle Donovan, from Petoskey, Michigan, who took her daughter Libby. ""The special mommy/daughter time made Family Spa Night one of a kind!"" ""It's an affordable luxury,"" added Carmen Gillett, an attorney from Sarasota, Florida, who takes her 9-year-old daughter, Rosie, to Longboat Key Club and Resort where kids' treatments might include a junior escape massage (strawberry kiwi body icing?). ""She loves it,"" Gillett says, adding, it's a great way to share an experience and have a good time yourself! While the International Spa Association reports that spa goers are opting for fewer and shorter treatments, youth spa programs continue to flourish -- likely because of the reduced fees. For that reason, said Anne Monnier, who took her daughter Hanna to the spa at Loews Lake Las Vegas Resort, ""It was well worth the price. It made her feel like royalty. And just having some special mother/daughter time (no husband or son allowed) was special in itself."" For tweens and teens, spa treatments aren't just about indulgence either; they can have a lasting impact. ""The teen facial made a difference. It also helps teach a young girl about taking care of her skin and about taking pride in her appearance,"" said Laura Patterson, who has been taking her daughter, Sara, to the Homestead's Kid Spa for years. Carmen Gillett jokes she didn't even know what a spa was until she was in college. ""I'm giving her everything I didn't have,"" she laughs. Serenity Shower, anyone?

"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- Those most responsible for last year's post-election violence in Kenya may now be punished by the International Criminal Court, after Kenya missed a deadline to address the issue. A man runs past a market set on fire in post-election violence in Nakuru, Kenya, in January 2008. Luis Moreno-Ocampo, the chief prosecutor of the court, said in a statement Wednesday that his court will now step in to help Kenya address the post-election violence of early 2008. ""Kenya will be a world example on managing violence,"" he said. Kenya's coalition government promised action after more than 1,000 people were killed following a disputed election in December 2007. Hundreds of thousands were displaced amid the bloodshed. One of the chief promises was the formation of a tribunal to try the perpetrators of that violence. Now that Kenya has missed the deadline, Moreno-Ocampo announced a plan to address the issue. In the statement, he said the International Criminal Court would prosecute those most responsible, and other perpetrators would be subject to ""national accountability proceedings as defined by the Kenyan Parliament, such as a Special Tribunal."" Kenya will also create ""other reforms and mechanisms such as the Justice, Truth and Reconciliation commission to shed light on the full history of past events and to suggest mechanisms to prevent such crimes in the future,"" the ICC statement said. During meetings with Moreno-Ocampo in July, a delegation from Kenya said that prosecuting those responsible for the violence was necessary to prevent similar acts ahead of the 2012 election.

"(CNN) -- Nebraska lawmakers, meeting in emergency session this week, are set to change a controversial safe-haven law by sharply limiting the age at which a child can be dropped off with local authorities. Thirty-five children have been dropped off at Nebraska hospitals since the law was enacted. The state Senate voted 41 to 6 Wednesday to scrap the current version of the law -- which has no age limitation -- and instead establish a strict 30-day age limit. State legislators have expressed concern that, if the law is not changed, Nebraska's social services system will be overwhelmed by older children delivered by parents from around the country who find they are unable to provide proper care. The legislature -- which has only one chamber, the Senate -- is expected to approve final passage of the revision this week before Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman signs it on Friday. Nebraska's safe haven law was intended to allow parents to hand over an infant anonymously to a hospital without being prosecuted. Of the 35 children who have been dropped off at hospitals since the law went into effect in September, however, not one has been an infant, officials say. All but six have been older than 10, according to the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. ""The abandonment of these children -- and the harm it is causing them -- is an immediate concern,"" said Jen Rae Hein, communications director for the governor. ""Some children have been begging their parents or guardians not to leave,"" said social worker Courtney Anderson. ""They may not really understand why they are being left at the hospital. But they know they are being left, and the parent or guardian might be fleeing."" On Tuesday, a 15-year-old girl was left at a hospital in Hall County, located in the central part of the state. Last week, a 14-year-old boy and his 17-year-old sister were dropped off at an Omaha hospital; the girl ran away from the hospital. Earlier in the week, a father flew in from Miami, Florida, to leave his teenage son at a hospital, officials said. ""Please don't bring your teenager to Nebraska,"" Heineman told parents in an interview with CNN. ""Think of what you are saying. You are saying you no longer support them. You no longer love them."" State Sen. Tom White said lawmakers have been caught off guard by the number of teenagers dropped off under the law. ""What you've seen is an extraordinary cry for help from people all across the country,"" he said. ""Nebraska can't afford to take care of all of them. Nebraska would like to be able to, but they know that we can't so we are going to have to change the law."" Five of the 35 abandoned children were brought to Nebraska from out of state. Parents have traveled to Nebraska from Michigan, Indiana, Iowa, Florida and Georgia. ""We didn't think [the law] would be used to the extent it [has been],"" state Sen. Brad Ashford said. ""We didn't anticipate children coming from other states."" Tysheema Brown drove from Georgia to leave her teenage son at an Omaha hospital. ""Do not judge me as a parent. I love my son and my son knows that,"" Brown said. ""There is just no help. There hasn't been any help."" Safe-haven laws allow distraught parents who fear their children are in imminent danger to drop them off at hospitals without being charged with abandonment. Nebraska was the last state in the country to pass such a law. But every other state included an age limit. There are 6,600 children in state custody in Nebraska, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. The per capita rate is one of the highest in the country, said Todd Landry, director of the Division of Children and Family Services for the Department of Health and Human Services, . ""I think this has spurred some really healthy conversations about how do parents get the help that they need when they are struggling with some of these parenting issues,"" he said. ""And the message that we have been trying to get out is, 'Don't wait until it's a crisis. Reach out to your family and friends.'

"(CNN) -- Honduras' de facto president said Thursday that he is willing to resign and let ousted President Jose Manuel Zelaya back into the country, as long as Zelaya gives up his quest for leadership. Ousted Honduras leader Jose Manuel Zelaya may be allowed to return to his country under certain conditions. The new proposal calls for the person next in line, as required by the constitution, to succeed de facto President Roberto Micheletti. Under terms of the proposal, Zelaya could return as a private citizen, but not be allowed to resume his post. Presidential elections held after both resigned would be monitored by international observers such as the Organization of American States and the European Union, according to the proposal. Zelaya did not immediately issue a response to the offer. Until now, Micheletti has made clear that Zelaya would be arrested if he returned. The offer comes two months after Zelaya was seized by the military in his pajamas and forced to leave the country. Micheletti has insisted that Zelaya was not overthrown and was replaced through constitutional means. The political crisis stemmed from Zelaya's plan to hold a referendum that could have changed the constitution and allowed longer term limits. The country's congress had outlawed the vote and the supreme court had ruled it illegal. The Organization of American States sent a delegation to Honduras on Tuesday to promote the so-called San Jose Accord, which seeks an end to the political turmoil and the return of Zelaya to office. Micheletti's government declined to sign the agreement. On Thursday, the United States said it was considering cutting off all aid to Honduras. Washington froze its assistance to Honduras after Zelaya was removed from office and stopped issuing visas in the Central American country earlier this week. Further steps could choke off as much $200 million in additional aid dispensed by the Millennium Challenge Corporation, funded by the U.S. government. The United Nations and the European Union also have said that they do not recognize Micheletti's provisional government.","Honduras interim leader agrees to step down if former president will not seek post .

"(CNN) -- The lawyer for the woman who faces 40 lashes for wearing clothes that Sudan deemed indecent called the law ""degrading."" Lubna al-Hussein was told she had trousers considered too tight and a blouse too transparent. ""They ought to stop it,"" Nabil Adib said on Thursday. ""It is quite unnecessary and degrading. It is harassment."" Lubna Al Hussein -- who writes for a newspaper and, until recently, worked for the media department of the U.N. mission in Sudan -- was arrested, along with 18 other women on July 3. At the time of her arrest, she said, she was wearing pants, a blouse and a hijab or headscarf. Police accused Hussein of wearing trousers that were too tight and a blouse that was too sheer, she said.  Watch more about the case » . A hearing on the case has been scheduled for Tuesday. Adib, the lawyer, seemed confident that the court would drop the case. The indecent clothing charge has only one punishment under Sudanese law -- 40 lashes in public, according to the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information. ""These things have their ups and downs,"" Adib said. ""These laws have generally relaxed as a matter of policy. But they are still sometimes enforced."" The Arabic Network humans rights organization said the threat of flogging was retaliation for Hussein writing critically about the Sudanese regime. However, Adib does not think his client was targeted. ""There are round-ups that they do and it is indiscriminate,"" he said. ""I don't think she was targeted specifically. They attack public and private parties and groups. They are called 'morality police' and she was just a victim of a round-up."" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Wednesday called flogging ""against the international human rights standards."" He said he would take every effort to protect his staff member. However, Hussein resigned from her position with the United Nations to avoid the immunity she would have received, Adib said. Hussein said she will stand firm that she did nothing wrong.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- On the surface, the similarities are striking; they were both princesses born in the 1940s in a foreign land. Young and beautiful, the long-haired brunettes soon fell in love and followed their men to the United States where they built a reputation for steely determination and strength. Diane von Furstenberg's comic book image appears in the window at the London launch of her Wonder Woman collection. Thirty years later, in the 1970s, one was rewarded with her own fashion empire, the other, her own TV show. The only thing really separating them was the magic lasso. Oh, and the invisible plane, and maybe the bracelets that deflect bullets... Belgian-born New York designer Diane von Furstenberg has used Diana Prince, aka Wonder Woman, as inspiration for her latest collection, a brightly-colored clothing range that proves dressing like a cartoon character needn't involve teaming knee-high boots with hot pants. The influence of the American stars and stripes are evident in the collection, but in the star piece, a full-length dress, they blend together in muted tones, hinting only at their origin rather than screaming out superhero. The collection was launched in London last night, a day after Barack Obama stormed home as the next President of the United States. Diane von Furstenberg watched the election results from a London hotel room, having lodged an absentee vote from Asia. ""I think it's amazing -- I think we need him desperately,"" she said. In what could only be a gift from the marketing gods, images of the President-elect dressed as Superman started appearing on street corners in the U.S. in the lead-up to the election. Obama has insisted he's no superman, but do the images demonstrate that America is hoping and searching for a superhero? If not Superman, maybe Wonder Woman? ""It's not about a superhero,"" says Diane von Furstenberg. It's just because he's bright and he's willing to do the work. And he's young and he has energy, and that's it."" Of all of America's superheroes -- and there are many -- Wonder Woman is seen as one of the most patriotic. She literally wears the stars and stripes.  See images of Wonder Woman through the ages and the DVF collection » . She was created in 1941 during World War II by William Moulton Marston as a female alternative to the plethora of male action heroes who were saving the world in comic books of the day. He also invented the lie detector, the early version of Wonder Woman's ""Lasso of Truth."" As the story goes, Wonder Woman was an Amazonian princess who left her home on Paradise Island to fight the ""Axis powers"" in the world of man. By day, she was Diana Prince who, with a quick spin, transformed into Wonder Woman, ready to destroy Nazi enemies, foil Japanese plots and expose international spy rings. In the early 1970s, she became a cover girl for feminism, appearing on the cover of the inaugural ""Ms."" magazine. Fame followed on television when she was immortalized by actress Lynda Carter. After years of lying low, she starred in a popular exhibition ""Superheroes: Fantasy and Fashion"" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York earlier this year. Curator Andrew Bolton says, ""When designers look to Wonder Woman there are two things they seem to refer to -- her role as Amazon woman, this strong powerful Amazonian figure -- and her as a symbol of America, a symbol of democracy."" In 2001, John Galliano for Christian Dior used Wonder Woman as inspiration for a rather risque ensemble which included a red and white striped jacket, starry gold bustier and tiny knickers. Bolton says the 9/11 attacks in 2001 sparked a resurgence in American patriotism that's been strengthened this week with the election of a man with a mandate for change. ""I think that the idea of patriotism has become much more potent, certainly in light of recent events,"" Bolton says. ""It's a celebration of a new regime, a new democratic regime."" It's perfect timing perhaps for the launch of a fashion range that celebrates an all-American, albeit originally Amazonian, hero. For Diane, the Wonder Woman collection is more about empowering women than tapping into the zeitgeist: ""The message is that there's a wonder woman inside every one of us,"" she says. She's penned a limited edition comic book to go with the collection, ""The Adventures of Diva, Viva and Fifa,"" which is emblazoned with the message ""Be the Wonder Woman you can be."" All proceeds from the sale of the comic books, and a portion of the sales of the collection, go to Vital Voices, a non-governmental organization that aspires to empower women in developing countries, to address human trafficking and to train future leaders. ""What Diane von Furstenberg has done for us, by the Wonder Woman book, by supporting us in the way she has done has raised the profile of Vital Voices,"" says Baroness Mary Goudie, one of the group's directors. ""And by her example, she's empowering young women and other women around the world."" A bit like Wonder Woman, really.","Wonder Woman inspired Diane von Furstenberg's latest fashion collection .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Academy Award winner Nicolas Cage has pretty much got this acting thing down. After all, he started acting at the age of 15 and, well, he's got that Oscar. Nicolas Cage says that Academy Awards are ""not as important as children and making them happy."" So he doesn't really need to deliver another gut-wrenching performance to demonstrate his chops. In fact, he can deviate from a traditional film and venture into animated territory. He's voiced animated characters in the past, but in Disney's new 3-D tale ""G-Force,"" Cage lends his voice to a mole. Speckles the star-nosed mole comes to life thanks to the film's impressive digital animation and Cage's voice. At first it's unclear that Cage is the voice behind Speckles, because he changes his sound for the critter, er, character. CNN talked to Cage about playing a mole, animated films and his taking walks in the forest. The following is an edited version of that interview: . CNN: What do you play in this film? Nicolas Cage: I'm playing Speckles, the mole, and he's an outsider. He's an iconoclast -- he doesn't fit in. He doesn't get into the fray with the ""G-Force,"" the other guinea pigs. But his IQ is off the charts, and he's a technological wizard. CNN: So, you're an Academy Award-winning actor, and you decided to play (this role). How did this come about? Cage: To me, nothing's more sacred than the magical world of children, and with everything that's going on in the world, it gets increasingly more challenging to keep our kids smiling -- people are losing their jobs, families are tense. So anything I can do to give families something to look forward to and to put a smile back on children's faces -- I'm gonna do. Disney has a great tradition of enchanting children and giving them something to behold. I mean, you mention Academy Awards -- I mean, that's not as important as children and making them happy. CNN: Tell me about your voice: Why did you decide to really change it when you read the script? Cage: Mel Blanc is a hero because of what he could do with his voice for all the Looney Tunes, the Warner Brothers cartoons, to be the voice of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Porky Pig. To me, he's a great actor. I mean, one of the great character actors, and I knew that if I was gonna be in this movie, I'd want to do something like that and transform my voice. CNN: So you're clearly comfortable playing a mole? Cage: I'm comfortable with the mole, yeah. I mean, yeah, he's different, he's got issues, you know? I don't want a perfect character, I want a character who has, as strange as it sounds, some humanity, some flaws, some needs. But to be fair, I'm not in a lot of this movie. This is Darwin's movie, um Sam Rockwell and Penelope Cruz's movie -- they're the stars. I'm only in it at the beginning and the end. CNN : You seem to be a big fan of animated films. Cage: I do enjoy animated movies. I really love anime and movies like ""Spirited Away"" and ""Howl's Moving Castle."" I like movies where you feel like you're going into another world, and no matter how many times you watch it, you're gonna see something new in that world. That level of detail really inspires me. CNN: Is there less pressure doing an animated film and lending your voice to a character as opposed to a traditional film? Cage: Well, you don't have the pressure of the camera. And that's -- that's very liberating. And you don't have the pressure of other actors trying to remember their dialogue or not being in rhythm with you. The challenge though is, these movies take years to make, and I may not be in the same state of mind I was in a year ago or two years ago, and then they tend to pull you out of wherever you are and put you back in a box, and then try to get the voice out of you again, so that's the rub. CNN: Have you gotten pretty good at honing your skills when it comes to choosing roles, or is it always a risk? Cage: I mean it is always a gamble. You never know what's gonna happen with a movie. But I think it's more of a matter of, am I doing something that I believe in on any level? Like, am I going to entertain children, or am I going to make a movie that I can stand by because it means well on some level? That's becoming more and more a part of the criteria. CNN: How do you think you've changed as an actor throughout your career? Cage: I think I've become more relaxed. I don't feel the need to jump up and down and make a big noise to get people to pay attention to me. I don't need to um, you know, do punk rock gestures or eat a cockroach or do something weird to say I exist. I feel like I'm hearing a different kind of sound now. It's a much more subtle sound, but it's still a truthful sound, that I can express myself in, in roles that are much more relaxed and seasoned as opposed to boisterous and rock and roll. CNN: What's inspiring to you, in every day. Cage: Well, I find children inspiring. The way they look at the world. The magical world they live in, to me, is inspiring. I like -- I mean, I'm afraid I'm gonna answer your questions and sound like a complete nature addict here, but uh, I like nature, I enjoy going for walks, I like the ocean, I like the forest. CNN: Is that what you do when you're not working, that's important to you in your life? Cage: Yes. Yes, I like to go for walks in the forest.","Nicolas Cage voices character of Speckles the mole in ""G-Force""

"(CNN) -- The Australian cruiser met the disguised German vessel in the waters off western Australia two years after the two became enemies in World War II. The gun turret of the Sydney II was discovered with the rest of the vessel in March 2008. The Australian ship approached, trying to determine whether the vessel was friendly. It wasn't. What resulted was Australia's worst naval disaster: the sinking of the Australian ship and the loss of its entire crew of 645. The wreckage wasn't found until last year, leading to decades of conspiracy theories about what actually happened. On Wednesday a long-awaited report on the sinking of the Sydney II ended the mystery that began when it met its fate, November 19, 1941. Made to look like a cargo ship, the German vessel was in fact a military raider that fired on the Australians when they got close. The Sydney fired back and, in the end, both ships went down. More than 300 of the sailors on board the German vessel, the Kormoran, survived. But because they were the only witnesses to the disaster, some doubted their accounts, leading to various theories about the real fate of the Sydney. After the wrecks of both ships were located in March 2008, an Australian commission began an inquiry to formally close the book on the loss of the Sydney. The results confirm the accounts provided by the German sailors. They said the Sydney closed in on the Kormoran until it was parallel with the German ship, little more than 1,000 yards away. ""Sydney obviously thought the ship was friendly and was taken by surprise when, after she asked what she believed to be (a friendly ship) to give her secret call sign, the response was a number of salvos that destroyed Sydney's bridge and amidships superstructure and a torpedo strike that crippled the ship and her forward guns,"" the report said. The Sydney had given up its tactical advantage of speed and armaments by getting so close to an unknown vessel, the report said. While that may have been an error of judgment by the Australian captain, Joseph Burnett, the report accepted that other factors -- which may never be known -- influenced his decision. ""It can never be known what matters were, in fact, operating in Capt. Burnett's mind when he decided to take the Sydney to the position described. Nor can it be known what advice, if any, he sought from or was given by other officers on the bridge,"" the report says. ""What is known, however, is that, in trying to identify the sighted ship, Capt. Burnett was performing his duty as a commanding officer."" The German ship inflicted ""enormous damage"" on the Sydney during a battle that is believed to have lasted about 35 minutes and left 70 percent of the Sydney's crew dead or incapacitated, said Cmdr. Jack Rush, the lawyer who presented the evidence gathered by investigators to a commission of inquiry led by a retired judge. It is likely that Burnett, the navigator, and all of the Sydney's senior officers were taken out on the first salvo, Rush said. A torpedo tore into the Sydney's bow, flooding the forward end of the ship, while the Kormoran fired an estimated 87 rounds from its 15-cm (5.9-inch) guns into the Australian cruiser. The Sydney limped away and sank sometime between 2 hours to 4 1/2 hours later, Rush said. During the battle, however, the Kormoran itself was hit by an Australian shell that damaged its engines and set the vessel ablaze. With hundreds of mines aboard, its captain ordered the crew to abandon ship, fearing the fire would set those off. Charges were set and the ship was scuttled. About 80 of the Kormoran's crew of nearly 400 were lost. A search began only five days after the battle, when the Sydney failed to return to port in Fremantle. And an 11-day delay by Australia's government in announcing the ship's loss fueled what a 1999 parliamentary report called ""a proliferation of theories"" about the fate of the crew -- that the ship was actually sunk by a Japanese submarine, that survivors were machine-gunned in the water or that the government hid bodies after they washed up on the beach. The commission thoroughly investigated all the theories and speculations surrounding the disaster and found no substance in any of them, said Terence Cole, president of the commission. Researchers found the Sydney's wreckage in the Indian Ocean, about 207 km (128 miles) off Australia's west coast. The commission was appointed in May 2008 and began its inquiry in January. ""For a long time our nation has struggled to understand how our greatest maritime disaster occurred. The unanswered questions have haunted the families of those brave sailors and airman that never came home,"" Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, the chief of the Australian Defence Force, said in a written statement.","Finding: Sydney's captain, senior officers likely to have died in first salvo .

"JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- Explosions tore through two luxury hotels Friday morning in south Jakarta, Indonesia, killing at least eight people, a presidential spokesman said. Counter-terrorist police commandos secure the damaged Ritz-Carlton hotel in Jakarta on Friday after the blasts. The number of injured was in the 40s, said Dino Patti Djalal, spokesman for President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. They were taken to area hospitals. Hours later, local television reported a car bombing in north Jakarta, but that report was immediately contradicted by various other media sources. Police sealed off the area around both hotel blasts, one in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel and the other at the J.W. Marriott Hotel, about 50 meters away. Djalal said the attacks were coordinated. Forensics experts are collecting evidence at the ""disturbing scene,"" Djalal said. He said he had few details about the blasts, which occurred about 7:45 a.m. (8:45 p.m. Thursday ET) on Friday, Islam's holy day. ""What I can say is one of the most damaged areas that we looked at, where the bodies were, was a lounge area in the Marriott near the lobby,"" he said. ""That seems to be the epicenter of the bomb."" ""This is a blow to us, but I don't have any doubts that we will be able to uncover and find out the perpetrators,"" Djalal said. Police said the bomb at the Marriott likely came from the basement beneath the coffee shop on the ground floor, which would have been busy at breakfast time. In a Twitter post four hours after the blast, Marriott said: ""Police responded immediately, sealed off the area. Guests @ both hotels have been evacuated & have been moved to a secure location."" At the Ritz, windows were blown out on the second floor, as though the blast occurred from inside a hotel restaurant that would also have been crowded with a breakfast crowd, said witness Greg Woolstencroft. Another witness counted four foreigners among the wounded, according to state-run Antara New Agency. The Ritz-Carlton Hotel was to have accommodated soccer players from Britain's Manchester United, who were expected to arrive in Jakarta on Sunday.  Watch a report on suspects behind the blasts » . U.S. Embassy Press Attache Paul Belmont told CNN no U.S. casualties have been confirmed and that the embassy was monitoring the situation closely. The death toll may be higher than reported, said CNN contributor Tom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director of international operations. He said two U.S. businessmen were treated for minor injuries. ""There was a boom and the building shook, and then subsequently two more,"" said hotel guest Don Hammer, who was leaving his room in the Marriott when the blast occurred. ""The shocking part was entering the lobby, where the glass at the front of the hotel was all blown out and blood was spattered across the floor, but most people were leaving calmly."" Woolstencroft had just walked past the hotels and had gone to his nearby apartment when he heard an explosion. ""I looked out my window and I saw a huge cloud of brownish smoke go up,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. ""I grabbed my iPhone to go downstairs ... and then the second bomb went off at the Ritz-Carlton, so I then ran around to the Ritz-Carlton and I was able to find that there had been a massive bomb that went off in this ... restaurant area and the explosion had blown out both sides of the hotel. ""I found inside the body of what appears to be a suicide bomber, it looked like someone who had been a suicide bomber or someone who had been very, very close to the explosion.  Watch an eyewitness report of the blasts » . ""I also noticed that there were a number of injured people being taken off to hospital, but I only noticed one dead person at this point and time, that's all I saw. There has been extensive damage to both buildings, and at this point and time of course all the authorities are blocking up all the area and starting an investigation."" He added, ""It's obviously targeted establishments where there are Westerners and expats ... I can only assume it's something to try and send a message."" The television executive said he had lived at the Ritz for a year before moving to his nearby apartment and had been impressed by the facility's security. ""I just don't know how someone could get in there with a bomb, given the level of security and screening that people have to go through,"" he said, citing armed guards at checkpoints and thorough searches of people, bags and vehicles. The Marriott was the site of a terrorist attack in August 2003 that killed 12 people. In that attack, an explosives-laden vehicle pulled into the motor lobby of the Marriott and exploded at the height of the lunch hour. Friday's attack ""was not nearly as bad,"" said John Aglionby, a reporter for the Financial Times who was at the site of both blasts. Former CNN producer John Towriss, who has spent many years in Jakarta, said the Marriott and Ritz often share employees and an underground passageway connects the two buildings that sit across the road from each other. Towriss said the Marriott has beefed up security since the 2003 attacks, making it impossible for people to drive up to the hotel in cars. Both hotels set up metal detectors and thick concrete barriers to prevent car bombers. ""I always thought I was safer at the Marriott because I thought it had already been bombed once,"" Towriss said. ""I thought that another hotel would be targeted.""

"NASSAU, Bahamas (CNN) -- John Travolta testified Wednesday that would-be extortionists threatened to go the media with stories implying ""the death of my son was intentional and I was culpable somehow."" John Travolta's son died of a seizure in January at the age of 16. Travolta testified for the second time in a case against paramedic Tarino Lightbourne and former Bahamian Sen. Pleasant Bridgewater. The defendants are on trial, accused of plotting to extort $25 million from Travolta after 16-year-old Jett Travolta died from a seizure in the Bahamas in January. Travolta and his wife, actress Kelly Preston, entered the downtown Nassau courthouse Wednesday morning surrounded by security personnel. The actor took the stand appearing nervous, and he took a long, deep breath before beginning his testimony. Travolta told the court a longtime employee of his became upset after learning someone was demanding money of the actor in the wake of his son's death. The employee learned through the family attorney, Travolta said, that it was ""in regards to a paper I signed in the Bahamas."" In earlier testimony, one of Travolta's lawyers, Allyson Maynard-Gibson, said Bridgewater approached her in the days after the January 2 death of Jett, saying she had a legal client who had a document Travolta might want. Bridgewater gave her copies of the papers, which included ambulance dispatch reports and a paper signed by Travolta releasing the ambulance company from legal liability, Maynard-Gibson testified. Watch In Session's Ashleigh Banfield discuss case » . The paramedic expected Travolta would pay millions to prevent publication of the documents because ""he would not want his name tarnished in media,""  Maynard-Gibson said. Bridgewater told Travolta's lawyer that her client believed the documents could suggest that Travolta was negligent by wanting to take his unresponsive son to his private jet for a flight to a Florida hospital, instead of going directly to a local hospital, she said. In testimony last week, Travolta said a nanny found Jett unresponsive at the home on the island of Grand Bahamas, where the family was spending their New Year's holiday. Travolta said he initially told the ambulance driver to rush them to an airport where his private jet was parked. Travolta, who is a pilot, said he wanted to fly his son to a West Palm Beach, Florida, hospital instead of driving him to one in Freeport. The paramedic, however, asked Travolta to sign a statement releasing the ambulance company from liability. ""I received a liability of release document. I signed it. I did not read it. Time was of the essence,"" Travolta testified last week. Travolta said that while he and his wife were riding in the ambulance with their son, they decided to divert to the hospital. At the hospital, Travolta was told his son ""wasn't alive,"" he said. On Wednesday, Travolta testified that he learned of a demand for $25 million or ""stories connected to that document would be sold to the press."" ""The stories would imply the death of my son was intentional and I was culpable somehow,"" Travolta said. An attorney representing Bridgewater and Lightbourne asked Travolta if the defendants ever contacted or threatened him directly. Travolta said they did not, that he heard specifics about the situation through his attorneys. Travolta's testimony lasted only a short time. He was excused and is not expected to return to the witness stand. One of the actor's attorneys, Michael McDermott, took the witness stand Wednesday afternoon and began testimony about a videotaped meeting between him and one of the defendants. The video is expected to be played Thursday for the jury.","Travolta in court: Defendants used papers to imply negligence in extortion attempt .

"(CNN) -- In a race to beat the flu season, medical institutes across the United States will begin human trials for a new H1N1 flu vaccine starting in early August, the National Institutes of Health announced Wednesday. Concern about the H1N1 virus grew after it spread quickly around the globe earlier this year. In the hope of getting the vaccine to those who will need it most by October, the clinical trials will enroll as many as 1,000 adults and children at 10 centers nationwide, said officials at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a division of the NIH, which will lead the effort. The trials will measure the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine. The research is a first step toward U.S. health officials' goal of developing a safe and effective vaccine against H1N1, also known as swine flu, which has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization . The time frame for developing a vaccine is a tight one. ""It's going to be close,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. ""I believe it can be [ready by October] if things run smoothly. We hope they will, but you never can tell when you're dealing with biological phenomena like making vaccines and administering them."" The announcement of the U.S. trials followed the announcement earlier this week, by an Australian company, CSL Ltd., of the first human trials of a swine flu vaccine. Concern about the H1N1 virus grew after it spread quickly around the globe earlier this year. ""This virus has the potential to cause significant illness with hospitalizations and deaths during the U.S. flu season this fall and winter,"" said Dr. Karen Kotloff, professor of pediatrics and lead investigator and researcher at Maryland's Center for Vaccine Development. ""Vaccines have always been a vital tool for controlling influenza. The results of these studies will help to guide the optimal use of the H1N1 vaccines in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world."" After careful screening, volunteers will be inoculated and then asked to keep a diary on how they feel. After eight days their blood will be checked and after 21 days they will receive another dose, followed again by diary logs and blood tests. Patients will be monitored two months for safety issues, followed by a four-month and six-month checkup. ""The purpose of these trials is always to make sure they are safe,"" Kotloff said. ""But even after six weeks, if things look good, we're pretty sure the vaccine will work."" She noted the response to the vaccine may vary in different age groups. ""This is because young people have not seen a flu virus like this one before,"" she noted. ""Older adults might have some immunity to the new H1N1 virus as a result of being exposed to similar flu viruses in the past. As a result, older adults might need fewer doses or a lower strength of the vaccine than younger individuals."" The vaccine at this point has been tested only in animals, where it has shown to be effective. Further trials will examine questions such as how the vaccine works in combination with the seasonal flu vaccine and whether including an adjutant, a substance that boosts the immune response to vaccines, can make it work better at lower doses. Other trial sites along with the University of Maryland Medical Center are Baylor College of Medicine, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Emory University, Saint Louis University, Seattle Group Health Cooperative, the University of Iowa, and Vanderbilt University. They will be joined by Children's Mercy Hospital and Duke University Medical Center. CNN's Valerie Willingham and Matt Cherry contributed to this report.","Human trials for H1N1 flu vaccine start August, says University of Maryland .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Reigning hot dog-guzzling champ Joey Chestnut and nemesis Takeru Kobayashi of Japan attempted to psych each other out Thursday at the weigh-in for the 94th annual Nathan's Famous Fourth of July International Hot Dog-Eating Contest. Competitive eaters Joey Chestnut and Takeru Kobayashi take part in an official ""staredown."" Chestnut and Kobayashi glared long and menacingly into each other's eyes in an official ""staredown."" At last year's contest, 25-year-old Chestnut, a civil engineering student at San Jose State University, eked out a win over Kobayashi, 31, in a tiebreaker after both initially consumed 59 dogs apiece. It was Chestnut's second slim victory over Kobayashi in as many years. Kobayashi vowed he will avenge those two defeats on Saturday. He also said he no longer suffers from the ""jawthritis"" that some cited as the culprit for his 2007 defeat, which snapped his six-year winning streak at Coney Island. Chestnut, for his part, said he had no intention of ceding the coveted mustard yellow belt -- competitive eating's answer to golf's green jacket. He is setting his sights this year on 68 hot dogs in 10 minutes. Saturday's competition will be partially about redemption for Chestnut, too. In May, he suffered a stinging defeat to Kobayashi in a loss he said ""really set a fire underneath me"" and ""made me hungry for this contest."" Chestnut revealed the extreme dietary regimen he is following in the days leading up to the contest. He said he is sticking to water to make sure he is ""empty"" when the mountain of hot dogs is placed in front of him. In addition to Chestnut, Kobayashi admitted to keeping a watchful eye on 32-year-old Tim ""Eater X"" Janus, whose signature painted face was described by Major League Eating impresario Richard Shea as an attempt to mask his ""inner torment."" In a recent trial round, Janus downed a personal-best 55 hot dogs -- a weiner's throw from the 59 that Chestnut and Kobayashi wolfed down last year. As a lead-in to the main event, Major League Eating on Friday will hold a first-of-its-kind ""cross-species"" eating contest between three competitive eaters and three Asian elephants. MLE's Shea described it as the realization of one of his two lifelong dreams, the other being a scenario in which a dozen competitive eaters eat the entire contents of a convenience store. Twenty finalists will compete in the championship on Saturday. They were culled from 18 preliminary contests and comprise a Who's Who of the world of competitive eating. For people who stuff their faces with record-breaking quantities of food, many of the contestants at the weigh-in boasted surprisingly svelte physiques. Juliet Lee, a 44-year-old Maryland salon owner fresh off the feat of downing 13.23 pounds of cranberry sauce in 8 minutes, clocked in at a mere 105 pounds. Kobayashi, at 123 pounds, lifted his T-shirt to reveal the sort of chiseled abdomen one would expect at a bodybuilding competition. Others contestants were not quite as disconcertingly trim. Fearsome world matzo ball-eating champion Eric ""Badlands"" Booker tips the scales at 400 pounds.","Reigning hot dog-guzzling champ Joey Chestnut, Takeru Kobayashi have staredown .

"(CNN) -- Many Google users probably didn't notice this month that they can now display their search tips in the Hawaiian language. Hawaiian is one of more than 125 ""interface languages"" now available on Google. Wedged between Hausa and Hebrew, Hawaiian is one of more than 125 ""interface languages"" now available on Google. The list also includes some humorous twists on English, including ""pirate,"" ""Klingon"" and ""Elmer Fudd."" But for Hawaiian educators, the addition of Hawaiian is a small step toward legitimizing a language that is considered ""critically endangered"" by the United Nations. ""It's the capstone of a lot of work,"" said Keola Donaghy, an assistant professor of Hawaiian studies at the University of Hawaii-Hilo. ""We've been doing this work for 18 years, simply trying to make it easier for people who speak Hawaiian to use these kinds of technologies."" It marks the first native American language available through the ""Google in Your Language"" program. Getting started . It took Donaghy several years to get the project off the ground through the ""Google in Your Language"" program, which was launched by the California-based company not long after it was founded in 1998. ""The idea was to enable users worldwide to be able to access Google in the language of their choice, and if it wasn't available, to enable users to help make it so,"" Google spokesman Nate Tyler said. ""Why limit users to a set of dominant languages if they were willing to help make Google their own?"" The results of the search are still in English, although the user can select a preference for Web pages written in more than 40 other main languages. Google works with linguists like Donaghy who are interested in translating search instructions into their language. ""Volunteers sign up on their own to provide translation,"" Tyler explained. ""They simply sign themselves up, declare a language proficiency, and then start translating or reviewing the products that are available for volunteer translation. ""When the translations are completed, we make the product(s) available in that language. Recent other languages like this include Maori language."" It was the Maori project, launched last year, that actually helped get Donaghy's initiative off the ground. Three years ago, Donaghy started e-mailing and calling Google about a Hawaiian language project, but he got no response. He put the project on hold until last year. ""When I heard the Maori version came out, I asked Google about it,"" Donaghy said. ""Apparently the original (language) coordinator had gone and as soon as a new coordinator was brought online, they set up the system."" Donaghy began working on the massive translation project sometime late last year. ""It was whenever I could find an hour or two in between teaching or other duties,"" he said. ""It was a combination of personal and work time."" He spent more than 100 hours translating the search terms that appear on the Google page into Hawaiian through the program. ""I did the actual translation from beginning to end, and then I consulted with my colleagues at the university who have worked on these projects in the past,"" Donaghy said. ""I wanted to be very consistent -- such as how you say 'Go to this menu and select this' -- or people may become confused."" What's Hawaiian for 'browsing' the Web'? Some of the Hawaiian words for terms such as ""links"" or ""Web browser"" had already been established when Donaghy and others worked on translating the Netscape Navigator search engine in 1997. ""Over the years, we usually face the debate of do we want to 'Hawaiianize' an English word, or take an old Hawaiian word and give it a new meaning,"" he said. He explained some of the challenges in translating terms, such as ""browsing"" or ""surfing,"" into Hawaiian. ""People use the term 'surf the Internet' and they'll say 'he'e nalu' which is literally surfing the ocean out on a board,"" he explained. ""But we use 'kele,' which is what you do when you're steering a canoe. So we chose that as you're navigating the net."" Donaghy finished the translation project in April, but there were issues with the code for the search engine that would not activate the Hawaiian language interface. The Hawaiian language interface actually launched on Apple's Safari browser first because Donaghy had worked with Apple to ensure that the language's diacritical marks and characters were available on the company's computers. ""Now, it comes with every computer that they ship,"" he said.  See and hear phrases in Hawaiian » . Some Apple computer users who had selected Hawaiian as their primary language for other programs noticed a couple of weeks ago that Google's search terms started appearing in Hawaiian, too. ""People started calling me and asking, 'Did you hack into my computer? My Google is in Hawaiian,'"" Donaghy said. ""And that was the point I said, 'OK, word is getting out about this' and I put out a news release. I was afraid someone was going to start freaking out, 'Why is my computer in Hawaiian?'"" Important milestone for Hawaii's culture . The initiative is an important milestone for Hawaiian linguists and cultural educators who have pushed to have their native language taught in schools alongside English. It wasn't until the 1980s that the law banning the Hawaiian language from being taught in schools was overturned. The law was established in the late 19th century as a prerequisite to Hawaii becoming a U.S. territory. Today, more and more Hawaiians are studying and majoring in Hawaiian language programs. There are Hawaiian language immersion programs in which English is taught as a second language. Mona Wood, a Hawaiian speaker and owner of a public relations firm in Honolulu, said there has been a kind of Hawaiian language ""renaissance"" in the state since the late 1970s. ""Even tourism has been learning and growing and realizing that our 'host culture' must be added to the visitor experience,"" Wood said. ""There are many more programs available at hotels and shopping malls that weren't there 20 years ago."" Wood said that when she studied Hawaiian in college, it was under the foreign languages department. ""It has been so wonderful to see so many of our youth embrace the native culture and see the programs expand to the point where there is an entire Hawaiian Studies Department,"" she said. ""One can now get a B.A. (Bachelor of Arts) and M.A. (Master of Arts) in Hawaiian language."" Wood -- who owns Ikaika Communications, which represents local officials, local and national companies and celebrities including Duane ""Dog the Bounty Hunter"" Chapman -- said that when she was growing up, ""Our culture was dying in every way."" ""Learning my roots came through my own curiosity -- choosing to take hula lessons when my mom wanted me to take piano,"" she said. ""Then I went to the Hawaiian High School, Kamehameha, and continued with some Hawaiian classes and joined a club at UH (University of Hawaii). ""Seeing Hawaiian knowledge becoming an asset over the years has been truly satisfying,"" she said. Donaghy hopes the Google initiative is another step toward giving Hawaiian ""the same status as English and other major European and Asian languages"" -- particularly in the fast-moving sector of technology. ""To me personally it's very important that we are giving the opportunity to have as many things in Hawaiian as in English,"" he said. ""So if we had not begun to address technology in the early 1990s, we would be telling people that this is a place where Hawaiian doesn't belong. You have to revert to English. ""We didn't want to send that kind of message so we've worked to make the language more accessible.""","Google search terms now available in Hawaiian .

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- ""Whip It!"" suggests what might have happened if Juno had gone to a high school as poky as Napoleon Dynamite's and decided that although her mother wanted her to be a beauty queen like Little Miss Sunshine, she'd rather just strap on roller skates. Ellen Page plays roller derby competitor Babe Ruthless in ""Whip It!"" Only here the petite, droll, feisty, Ellen Page-like heroine played by Ellen Page is named Bliss. And her idea of sass while chatting up a cute rocker (Landon Pigg) in this desexualized, slow-speed grrrl-power sports fantasy is ""I'm Bliss, but I could change that."" Bliss does change her name, at least at the Roller Derby rink. She sneaks away from her square parents (Marcia Gay Harden as the U.S. Postal Service's least likely mail carrier and Daniel Stern as a nice schlub who likes beer) to roll with a sisterly Austin team who call themselves the Hurl Scouts. There, she dubs herself Babe Ruthless, making up in speed what she lacks in muscled aggression. She's heck on wheels, or so we are asked to believe: The rink footage is pretty un-whippy. Even Juliette Lewis, playing the film's designated bad girl and Bliss/Babe's nemesis on the rink, is more of a cute bee-yotch than a real threat. The movie is Drew Barrymore's directorial debut (she also plays fellow Hurl Scout Smashley Simpson), and it's clear she's more attuned to grrrlishness than real athletic power: Smashley is the first to scream ''Food fight!'' and the 34-year-old actress leads the charge in kidlike mayhem.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- U.S. authorities arrested six people Wednesday on suspicion of smuggling African elephant ivory worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, law enforcement officials said. Imports of African elephant ivory have been banned in the United States since 1976. The defendants arranged to have ivory from Cameroon, Ivory Coast and Uganda shipped into the United States disguised as wooden snakes, guitars and statues, authorities said. ""The defendants plundered precious natural resources for personal profit,"" U.S. Attorney Benton J. Campbell and other officials said in a statement. ""Their illegal trade threatens the continued existence of an endangered species and will not be tolerated."" Federal agents tracked at least eight shipments, including one worth an estimated $165,000. Federal agents used surveillance and shipping, phone and bank records to track the suspect shipments. Arrests were made in New York, New Jersey, Virginia and Texas. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement division of the Department of Homeland Security were involved in the law enforcement operation. One suspect told an undercover federal agent during a purchase that it was difficult to bring ivory into the United States, but easy to sell it at high prices, the government statement said. Two other suspects also are accused of paying a courier $15,000 to bring a shipment of ivory from Cameroon into the United States. The U.S. banned ivory imports in 1976, and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora effectively outlawed trade in elephant tissue in 1989. Illegal trade in African elephant ivory is considered to be a major cause of the continuing decline of elephant populations in Africa. The defendants are expected to appear in court in New York on Wednesday. They face jail terms of up to 20 years if convicted.","Six in four states face federal smuggling charges, U.S. attorney says .

"(CNN) -- The modern and dysfunctional man, who struggles to find his footing in relationships, career and, in fact, the world, has in many ways been the bread and butter of best-selling British author Nick Hornby's career. Best-selling British author Nick Hornby releases his latest novel, ""Juliet, Naked."" Best known for his novels ""High Fidelity"" and ""About a Boy,"" both of which were turned into movies (as was his memoir, ""Fever Pitch""), Hornby's latest novel, ""Juliet, Naked,"" released in the United Kingdom on September 1, has just been released in the United States. It focuses on an American singer-songwriter, Tucker Crowe, who still rests on the success he saw with one album in the 1980s, an obsessed English fan, Duncan, and his exasperated girlfriend, Annie. Hornby's love for music has inspired more than plotlines. It has fueled a partnership with the rock band Marah and other projects, which recently included penning the lyrics for Ben Folds' ""Levi Johnston's Blues."" Meanwhile, Hornby is also the force behind the screenplay of the critically acclaimed film-festival darling, ""An Education,"" which will be released in New York and Los Angeles on October 9. CNN spoke with Hornby about how he develops the characters for his books, the challenges of writing in a woman's voice and his own prowess in relationships. CNN: Your newest novel, ""Juliet, Naked,"" seems to revisit the kind of character that anchored ""High Fidelity,"" the obsessive, somewhat dysfunctional music fan. What is it about this type that had you coming back, and how have the years changed this character? Hornby: Well, I conceived them as being different. Rob in ""High Fidelity,"" he wasn't the obsessive. It was the people around him. This one [Duncan] is one of three characters; he's the nerdy obsessive. ... The Internet's changed everything. There are no record stores to hang out in anymore. Ten or 15 years ago, he [Duncan] wouldn't have found anyone to talk to. And nobody's career [character Tucker Crowe's included] is allowed to die. Way back, obsessives had to admit other interests into their lives. These people don't have to really do anything like that.  Watch the author talk about music, comedy and relationships » . CNN: Your books, and now your screenplay, are so rich in complicated and incredibly flawed characters who, in turn, have complicated and flawed relationships. How much of what they struggle with is autobiographical? Are there aspects to these characters that are reflections of you? Hornby: I think sometimes there are. I have three kids by two moms. Tucker has five kids by four women. But my experience is relatively ordinary. My relationships are fairly stable. A lot of this is trying to write comedy, and complicated relationships are funnier than straightforward ones. CNN: At times, for instance in your book ""How to Be Good,"" you've narrated as a woman. What are the challenges of taking on a woman's voice? Hornby: Anytime the narrator is someone who is not you, the challenge is equal. The challenge is to make people laugh. My last book, ""Slam,"" was for young adults, and I had to write as a 16-year-old boy. Of course, it makes me more nervous writing as a woman. I just made sure every woman I knew read the narrative as soon as I finished. But no woman speaks for all women. CNN: You've been open about having a son, now 16, who is autistic. How much, if at all, has that informed your writing when it comes to getting into the heads of kids and adolescents in, for example, ""About a Boy?"" Hornby: It hasn't. Not yet. The experience of fathering a child like that is so different, but I think you have to be very careful about how you use it and how it affects other people. CNN: Your screenplay for ""An Education,"" which is based on an autobiographical essay by British journalist Lynn Barber, was first recognized at the Sundance Film Festival in January and continues to get critical acclaim. How has this creative journey differed from the one you're used to traveling in the book publishing world? Hornby: The process is incredibly different. With movies, it always feels like such a long shot getting it made. With books, you write and talk about it with your editor. With movies, you need the money, the cast, the director -- I felt much more confused by the the movie-making process. CNN: But with movies, the insecurities you might have about your own work as an artist, as a writer, are helped by others. It's not all on you, right? Hornby: Yes. I can look at the film and take pride in other people's work.","Nick Hornby, author of ""High Fidelity"" and ""About a Boy"" releases new book Tuesday .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- The two men running Michael Jackson's estate gained new powers and an extension of their authority until the end of the year in a court hearing Friday. An investigator's report said Michael Jackson's children are doing well with Katherine Jackson as their guardian. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff also accepted an investigator's report that said Jackson's three children are adjusting well under the guardianship of Katherine Jackson. ""It looks like the children are really doing wonderfully with their grandmother guardian,"" Beckloff said. Joe Jackson sat in the courtroom for the hearing on estate and custody matters. It was the first time Michael Jackson's father has attended the hearings since his son's June 25 death. John Branca and John McClain, named as executors of Jackson's 2002 will, have been handling the estate's business as temporary special administrators since July while the will probate process is completed. Branca was a longtime attorney for Michael Jackson, who was rehired by the pop star just a week before his death, according to estate lawyer Howard Weitzman. McClain is a former music industry executive who worked with Jackson for years. Katherine Jackson's challenge of Branca and McClain appears headed for a trial in December, unless an agreement is reached between them. Her lawyers have not publicly given their objections to the two men, but have suggested the trial would explore possible conflicts of interest that would prevent them from running the estate. Jackson's lawyers have also said a Jackson family member should be included as an executor. While Joe Jackson did not speak to reporters after the hearing, a Jackson family friend, Majestik Magnificent, talked about the special administrators. ""Why are they even here? Why are they even involved in this? This is a family affair,"" he said. Until now, the administrators had to ask for court approval for every agreement they made for the estate, including a deal for a movie that will hit theaters at the end of October. ""Things went well for the estate, because the estate can now continue to do it's business,"" Weitzman said after the hearing. Beckloff said that while the case is fascinating, his calendar is too full for him to be involved in all of the estate's business. With their new powers, the special administrators only have to notify the court and the Jacksons about deals. Michael Jackson's mother and three children, along with unnamed charities, are the beneficiaries of the estate, which is estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. An odd moment came in the hearing when a woman who has previously filed a papers claiming to be the mother of Michael Jackson's youngest child, Prince Michael II, spoke up to remind the judge she was there. She says her name is Billie Jean Jackson. At the end of the hearing, Joe Jackson approached her, but she frowned at him and walked away. Majestik Magnificent later wondered aloud why reporters even give any attention to ""crazy"" people surrounding the case.","Judge extends Michael Jackson administrators' powers until the end of the year .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- One of Iraq's top Shiite leaders died Wednesday after a lengthy battle with lung cancer, a senior official with his office told CNN. Iraqi Shiite leader Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, seen in a 2007 photo, was an ally of both the U.S. and Iran. Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, who was born in 1950, died in Tehran, Iran, where he had been receiving treatment for more than two years, according to his adviser Haitham al-Husseini. Al-Hakim had recently suffered a medical setback, according to his party, which asked people to pray for him in a statement released on Sunday. His body will be sent to Iraq and he will be buried in his hometown of Najaf, one of the holiest cities for Shiite Muslims, al-Husseini said. U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Christopher Hill and the top U.S. commander in Iraq, Gen. Ray Odierno, issued a joint statement expressing sadness over al-Hakim's death and describing him as ""a national leader."" ""Throughout his life, His Eminence demonstrated courage and fortitude, contributing to the building of a new Iraq,"" the statement said. ""We offer our sincere condolences to his family and colleagues.""  Watch how al-Hakim helped shape Iraq's future » . Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki also offered his condolences, saying al-Hakim was ""like an old brother."" Al-Maliki credited him for being a ""strong supporter during the phase of fighting the ousted regime and a key figure in the process of building the new Iraq."" ""His death at this critical stage that we are passing through is a great loss for Iraq,"" al-Maliki said in the statement. Al-Hakim ended his more than 20-year exile in Iran in 2003, when he returned to Iraq after U.S.-led forces toppled Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his regime. ""It was very emotional for me to meet with my people after Saddam fell,"" al-Hakim said in a 2006 interview. ""I was longing to see them. My goal in this life is to serve those great people and I am very proud to be a part of them."" Iraqi Shiites were suppressed under the Hussein regime, which favored the country's minority Sunni Muslims. Al-Hakim played a central role in shaping Iraq's future following his return. During his exile, which began in the early 1980s, al-Hakim commanded the Badr Brigades, the military wing of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq. SCIRI -- a religious movement that opposed the Hussein regime -- was led by al-Hakim's brother until he was assassinated in August 2003. Al-Hakim himself was also the target of numerous assassination attempts. He took over as the head of SCIRI and began his ascent to power as the Badr Brigades became the bulk of the Iraqi security forces in Iraq's predominantly Shiite south. SCIRI changed its name to the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq in 2007 to remove the word ""revolution,"" in an effort to reflect the current situation in Iraq. Al-Hakim had always propagated a message of peace, calling on Iraqis to stop taking part in the bitter sectarian conflict that followed the fall of Saddam Hussein. But despite his desire for a secular democracy in Iraq, he wanted a country that recognized the importance of religion, religious institutions and its authorities. Al-Hakim successfully harnessed the fervor generated from emotional religious rituals like Ashura and turned it into a powerful political platform. That ability led some to consider him Iraq's most powerful man. His political bloc won the most seats in the Iraqi parliament in 2005. And although al-Hakim never held a government position, he commanded respect from those who did. Government ministers would meet with him at his office, not theirs, and he was often seen in the company of former U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Zalmay Khalilzad. And when talks on Iraq's constitution stalled, then-President George W. Bush called al-Hakim, not the Iraqi prime minister or president. Al-Hakim visited the United States three times during the Bush administration to address the situation in Iraq. But he remained artfully vague about Iran's influence in Iraq, saying its role was a positive one -- in direct contradiction to the U.S. government, which raised concerns about what it called Iran's ""meddling."" He cited the two predominantly Shiite Muslim countries' shared border, historical and cultural relations, and emphasized the desire for strong ties. Al-Hakim's death comes at a time of violent political turmoil in Iraq. The power of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq party he leaves behind is just as uncertain as the nation he so proudly wanted to serve. Al-Hakim was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2007, and was first treated in the United States, then later in Iran. When he returned to Iraq later that year, he told CNN that he felt good. But it was around that time that it became apparent he was grooming his son, Ammar al-Hakim, to take over as head of ISCI. It was once Iraq's most powerful Shiite political party, but ISCI lost much of its influence following elections in January, when politicians allied with al-Maliki won control of most of Iraq's provincial councils. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","NEW: U.S. officials, Iraqi PM offer condolences, praise for Abdul Aziz al-Hakim .

"(CNN) -- After hours of back and forth between members, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America decided Friday evening to accept noncelibate clergy members and lay leaders who are in ""lifelong"" and ""monogamous"" same-sex relationships. Previous Evangelical Lutheran Church policy allows gay and lesbian clergy, lay people to serve only if celibate. One of the country's largest Protestant denominations, the Lutheran church approved four recommendations to its ministry's policies that underscore a new approach to homosexuality. While the recommendations passed at the weeklong Churchwide Assembly in Minneapolis, Minnesota, do not address recognizing same-sex marriage or civil unions, they do allow congregations to support same-sex relationships among their members and allow individuals in same-sex relationships to hold clergy positions. The previous policy of the 4.6-million member church allowed gay people to serve as members of professional rosters only if they were celibate. Some members argued prior to the vote that the change would fly in the face of religious teachings. ""Brothers and sisters, I ask you, before you dig yourselves deeper into this hole, if you are so absolutely certain that these behaviors are not sinful that you are willing to place yourselves and this church at the spiritual risk that comes from encouraging sin,"" said the Rev. Steven Frock of the Western Iowa Synod. Among those on the other side was Alan Wold of the Northern Illinois Synod. ""If according to some I am going to be in err for supporting this... Let me err on the side of mercy, grace, justice, and love of neighbor. Let me err on the side of gospel, which makes all things new."" Many feared the emotional debate could tear at the unity of the church. So the members voted to re-order their resolutions -- moving to the top a resolution that the church ""commit itself to bear one another's burdens, love thy neighbor, and respect the bound consciences of all."" It passed with overwhelming support. Other religious denominations, including Episcopalians and Unitarians, have made moves to accept gay clergy, and Evangelical Lutherans would not be the first to accept those openly in same-sex relationships, said David Masci, a senior researcher at the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life. But ELCA would be the largest to make such a move. The church is the third largest Protestant denomination, representing 2 percent of the U.S. population, according to the Pew Forum. The battle Friday was the latest in what Masci said many ""socially moderate"" denominations, including those in Judaism, are grappling with: balancing the growing acceptance of same-sex relationships with traditional teachings. As some have moved toward accepting same-sex relationships, within those same denominations ""you see more conservative wings that are pushing back against it,"" said Masci. On hand for Friday's debate were hundreds of ""interested parties"" -- including some people who are not members of the church, said John Brooks, ELCA spokesman. When asked whether there had been protests or rallies on either side outside the convention site, he responded, ""Interestingly, no."" In the convention hall, Brooks said, ""The debates haven't been rancorous or mean-spirited in any way. They've been quite civil. But people have been passionate with their feelings."" The Rev. Terri Stagner-Collier of the Southeastern Synod said a vote in favor of the resolutions would cause members of her own family to leave the church. Her sister ""felt her church was being ripped away from her,"" Stagner-Collier said tearfully, adding, I urge you not to do this to all of those people in the pew and in my family."" Sara Gross of the Oregon Synod said some ""dear members"" of the church will be lost if the resolution passes. But, she said, ""A vote to reject this recommendation sends a message to the world saying 'not all are welcome.'"" In a ""changing world,"" Gross argued, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America ""needs to be a voice that stands up and says 'yes.'"" CNN's Josh Levs contributed to this report.","Evangelical Lutheran Church to accept gay clergy in lifelong relationships .

"(CNN) -- After actress Mackenzie Phillips spoke about her sexual relationship with her musician father, online and telephone calls to an anti-sexual assault hot line surged. Mackenzie Phillips told Larry King that incest survivors are ""incredibly underrepresented."" Her interviews in the past few weeks brought a spotlight to an uncomfortable topic. Incest, a common but highly stigmatized form of sexual abuse, often leaves the victim ashamed, isolated and unable to tell others what's happening, because the perpetrator is someone related to him or her, mental health experts said. ""For any survivor of sexual trauma, it's challenging, and it takes a lot of courage to come forward,"" said Jennifer Wilson, director of the National Sexual Assault hot line. ""With incest survivors, it's particularly difficult, because not only is there social stigma pressuring them to stay quiet, but also there's pressure that's within the family to stay quiet."" The Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, which calls itself the nation's largest anti-sexual assault organization, said it had seen an 83 percent increase in activity on its online hot line and a 26 percent increase on its telephone hot line after Phillips' interview with Oprah Winfrey aired last week. ""Unfortunately, it's something we hear everyday in our hot line, so to have somebody speak aloud about it was empowering to a lot of victims and survivors who went through similar situations,"" Wilson said. Phillips spoke about the taboo nature of incest in her interview with CNN's Larry King. ""There's very little in this world that is taboo today, but this subject is still, like, shove it under the carpet, sweep it away, protect the abuser, deny the reality. ... You're just on your own,"" the former child star said. This makes it one of the most under-reported and least discussed crimes, experts said. A U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics report found that of the 60,000 sexual assault cases reported in 12 states in 2000, about a quarter were perpetrated by family members. About half of the sexual assault cases with victims younger than 11 involved family members. At times, a victim may feel unable to tell other family members what's happening. And if he or she tells a relative, that family member may have ""a knee-jerk reaction,"" refusing to believe it. Relatives may try to protect the offender in order to keep the family together or to avoid the shame and stigma, Wilson said. This takes a devastating toll on a victim. ""Their sexual selves are damaged. Their emotional selves are damaged, because 'who do I trust?' "" said Debra Laino, a sex therapist and counselor. "" 'My father did this. My mother did this. Who can I trust if I can't trust my family?' "" Sometimes the reluctance to report the crime comes from the victim, because he or she doesn't want to see the family member in jail. Although Phillips called the sexual relationship with her famed father, John Phillips, ""wrong,"" she said, ""I don't want bad things to happen to him, but I also don't want bad things to happen to me as a result of this. And I was convinced to let it lie."" Her father, a co-founder of the Mamas & the Papas, died in 2001. Father- or stepfather-daughter incest is the most common form, although it also occurs between mother and child, according to the National Center for Victims of Crime. A sexual assault victim could suffer physical effects of the crime such as sexually transmitted infections, genital trauma and urinary tract infections. They could also experience many mental health effects: social withdrawal, isolation, post-traumatic stress disorder and regressive behavior such as bedwetting and thumb sucking. Some become hypersexual and engage in destructive behaviors, experts said. Humans ""have an instinct for avoiding incest or inbreeding,"" said Debra Lieberman, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Miami (Florida) who researches incest. But alcohol, drugs and mental illness may disrupt that instinct. ""Under the heavy influence of cocaine or heroin or whatever else you're taking, your mental boundaries are skewed, essentially,"" Laino said. The offender's sexual frustrations could also contribute to inappropriate actions. ""It also depends on his other mating opportunities,"" Lieberman said. ""What is the quality of his current relationship with the female's mother? Is she around? What is the ability for the guy to attract other mates?"" The perpetrator, frustrated by the absence of suitable sexual partners, may turn to whomever is around -- even if it's kin. Recovery from incest can occur, but it often takes years. A victim of incest has to understand that it's not his or her fault and get professional help, Wilson said. ""It doesn't make you broken,"" Phillips said.  ""It doesn't make it so that you can't go on and be -- once you deal with honestly and realistically what you've been through, it doesn't mean that you can't be counted on or you can't be well enough to be a part of the world.""","Actress said she had sexual relationship with her father for years .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- When the economy gets tough, the tough come out fighting. For some businesses, that means bringing out a fighter brand -- a cut-price version of a flagship product, marketed under a new name, and intended to fight back against budget competitors. ""Jetstar"" is a fighter brand that worked, beating the competition and creating a lasting, money-making brand. When it's done right it can destroy cut-price competition, but done badly it can drive a business to the brink of bankruptcy. Mark Ritson, associate professor at Melbourne Business School, has written an article for the October issue of Harvard Business Review discussing the benefits and pitfalls of launching a fighter brand. He says that over the next six months a number of new fighter brands are likely to appear in response to the recession. ""Fighter brands are very unusual but they are becoming increasingly common,"" he told CNN. ""It's high risk and high reward, and when it works it can have astonishing results."" Ritson gives the example of Intel, which launched its budget ""Celeron"" chip in the late 1990s to in response to AMD's low-priced chips, which were threatening Intel's premium ""Pentium"" brand.   Read more business features  With ""Celeron,"" Intel came up with a budget alternative to ""Pentium"" for the lower end of the market and cemented its position as market leader. But Intel's success is the exception rather than the rule. ""The majority of fighter brands not only haven't worked, but have gone on to do significant damage to the companies that launched them,"" said Ritson. General Motors' (GM) ""Saturn,"" United Airlines' ""Ted,"" and Kodak's ""Funtime"" film range are all high-profile fighter brands that failed. Despite the appeal of taking on the competition in a fist fight, launching a successful fighter brand is easier said than done. ""The problem is that fighter brands are almost always a knee-jerk reaction to a problem and are not always well thought out,"" Neil Saunders, consulting director with Verdict Research, told CNN. Ritson says one element in building a fighter brand is to avoid creating a low-price product that is so attractive that it steals customers who would otherwise be buying that company's premium-brand product. On the other hand, if the fighter brand is too expensive or too low quality, it won't put up much of a fight against the opposition it's designed to attack. Another complication is that even the biggest companies don't have the money and managerial time to distract themselves with a new brand at a time when they should be concentrating on their core products, and then there is the difficulty in operating at an unfamiliar low price level. ""The airline industry is a prime example, where people have launched fighter brands to combat the budget airlines and have been notoriously unsuccessful,"" said Saunders. ""If it's not your business model it's not easy to operate, and it's not usually these airlines' business model."" United's ""Ted,"" and Delta Air Lines ""Song"" were launched to combat budget carriers, but they weren't up to the challenge. In fact, Ritson says those fighter brands contributed to United and Delta's bankruptcy. But with its budget ""Jetstar"" airline, Qantas managed to find the holy grail for fighter brands -- beating the competition and creating a lasting, money-making brand in its own right. So what was different about the Qantas model? ""One thing was that Qantas took a long, hard look at the numbers and decided if they could be profitable,"" said Ritson. ""One of the problems with fighter brands is that they are oriented towards destroying a competitor and because of that managers pay a lot less attention to the bottom line."" He gives the example of GM's ""Saturn,"" a car designed to take on fuel-efficient, affordable Japanese cars. ""Saturn"" sold plenty of cars, at least at first, but its high operating costs meant it lost millions of dollars, playing a huge part in bankrupting GM. So given the huge risks involved, should companies even consider launching a fighter brand? ""Only do it if you can win and it fits with your existing proposition,"" says Saunders. Ritson cautions, ""The minute you add a new brand to your portfolio it's hundreds of thousands of hours of management time, and millions of dollars in development, advertising and distraction. ""Ask the question, 'do I need a fighter brand or is this a real seismic change in the market, which means I need to change my existing strategy with existing brands?' Otherwise you will lose five years and $50 million.""","Fighter brands are designed to fight back against low-priced competition .
Done wrong, fighter brands can drive a company to the brink of bankruptcy .
GM's ""Saturn"" is a fighter brand that failed, while Intel's ""Celeron"" succeeded .
New fighter brands are likely to be launched in response to the recession ."
"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A lot of people like Adam Sandler. Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen star in ""Funny People,"" the new film from Judd Apatow. The box office earnings for many of his films are testament to his drawing power. Sandler's biggest comedic blockbusters include ""Big Daddy,"" ""The Waterboy"" and ""The Longest Yard,"" each of which has earned well over $150 million domestically. He has seven other titles that have also passed the coveted $100 million mark. The thing all these films have in common is that they are all comedies. So, it's likely safe to assume there are more than a few Hollywood execs nervously biting their knuckles right now, wondering how Sandler's latest big-screen offering, the dark comedy ""Funny People"" -- written and directed by his longtime friend Judd Apatow (""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"") -- will fare.

"(CNN)  -- California legislators plan to keep trying to find consensus on a controversial proposal that would release at least 27,000 inmates from state prisons. California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, right, and officials tour a prison last week in Chino after a riot there. The California Assembly on Monday delayed a possible vote on the plan. Lawmakers likely will take up the proposal Wednesday or Thursday, said Shannon Murphy, a spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Karen Bass. ""When we arrive at a responsible plan that can earn the support of the majority of the Assembly and make sense to the people of California, we will take that bill up on the Assembly floor,"" Bass, a Los Angeles Democrat, said in a statement. Bass said legislators continue to meet with each other and law enforcement authorities to try to craft a plan that increases public safety, improves the state corrections department and reduces costs. As part of the negotiations, a provision that would set up a 16-member sentencing commission -- which would put new sentencing guidelines in place by 2012 -- was stripped from the bill, Murphy said. But ""it's not as if we're giving up on that notion,"" she said. The sentencing commission is a priority for Bass, she said, but the speaker believes she will have more success if she introduces a separate bill to create it. A panel of three federal judges has ordered California to reduce its prison population by about 40,000 by mid-September. The judges acted on the grounds that overcrowded prisons violate inmates' constitutional rights. The state Senate voted 21-19 Friday to release several thousand inmates early. That vote came after Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg, a Sacramento Democrat, assured senators the public would be protected from the most violent offenders. ""Of course, we want to keep violent criminals off our streets and out of our communities, and this reform package is a necessary step to do that because it concentrates our incarceration efforts on the violent criminals and ensures that nonviolent offenders have more contact with parole officers,"" Steinberg said Friday. All 15 Senate Republicans voted against the bill, arguing that it undermines public safety. Democrats control both houses of the California Legislature. ""California's prison system is in a state of crisis,"" Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said last week while touring the California Institution for Men in Chino. Some 250 inmates were injured this month at the facility in a riot that officials said was ignited by racial tension. Fifty-five inmates were taken to hospitals with serious injuries, including stab wounds and head trauma. Schwarzenegger said the riot was ""a terrible symptom of a much larger problem. ... Our prisons are overcrowded and endangering the staff and the inmates."" The governor noted he had signed a budget that mandates $1.2 billion in cuts to the state corrections system. ""We must be measured and smart about how we go about and create those reductions,"" said Schwarzenegger, a Republican. ""We must find a way to cut costs and relieve overcrowding but without sacrificing public safety."" Steinberg said the bill under debate would save the financially strapped state some $524.5 million. Coupled with budget revisions made in July, the savings would total the entire $1.2 billion, he said. Republicans said the bill would lead to the release of about 27,000 prisoners, while Democrats estimated it would reduce the prison population by 27,300 in the 2009-10 fiscal year and 37,000 during fiscal year 2010-11. But Steinberg said the measure also would reduce the ratio of parolees to parole officers to 45-to-1. Currently, one parole officer is responsible for about 70 parolees, many of whom commit new crimes and return to custody; the state has a 70 percent recidivism rate.","California Assembly delays vote on plan to release at least 27,000 inmates .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- The wounds of partition festered again this week in India, resulting in the banning of a book and the expulsion of a respected politician. Protesters burn an effigy of Jaswant Singh over his book; the former foreign minister was ousted from his party. The home state of the father of Indian independence, Mahatma Gandhi, forbade the sale and circulation of a new book it says spews revisionist history about the birth of secular but predominantly Hindu India and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Written by Jaswant Singh, a former federal minister and senior member of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the book calls Mohammed Ali Jinnah, considered by Indians the architect of the partition, a great man who is wrongly demonized. Jinnah went on to become the first governor general of Pakistan. In ""Jinnah: India, Partition and Independence,"" Singh absolves the Pakistani leader as the man responsible for dividing the subcontinent, suggesting instead that it was another beloved independence leader, Sardar Patel, who played a major role. ""The book wrongfully portrays the fateful partition of our nation,"" the Gujarat state government said in a statement. "" Such a brainchild has no historic background at all. In the larger interest of society, the state government has decided to impose a ban on the book."" The BJP accused Singh of deviating from the party's ""core ideology"". ""We always respect freedom of expression but can never compromise our ideology,"" Sidharth Nath Singh, a party spokesman, told CNN. ""You just can't eulogize Jinnah and accuse Sardar Patel instead."" Singh, a widely respected politician known for his moderate views within the ranks of a conservative party, found it appalling that freedom of expression was threatened in the world's largest democracy. ""The day we start banning books, we are banning thinking,"" Singh told reporters. He defended his work and said he did not understand the objection to his writings about Patel, who, as India's first home minister, banned the Hindu revivalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the mother organization of the BJP, after the assassination of Gandhi in 1948. ""I don't know which part of the core belief I have demolished,"" Singh said. Nearly 350 years of British rule ended in 1947 when an agreement for independence was reached to give Muslims their own homeland. Indians think of Jinnah as the man who pushed a two-state notion based on religion as a prerequisite for freedom. In the days that followed, an estimated 1 million people died in a border-crossing exodus. Muslims fled from India into Pakistan while Hindus clamored to find new homes in India. The animosities fueled by that bloody birth -- including three wars fought by India and Pakistan over the disputed territory of Kashmir -- continue to haunt Indians, said journalist and author Tarun Tejpal. ""This flashpoint played out in public is a reminder of those wounds,"" Tejpal said of the book dispute. As a book of history written by a politician, it might have been inconsequential, Tejpal said. But as a book about the partition, it was incendiary. ""What happened 62 years ago continues to haunt us in a very bitter way,"" Tejpal said. ""We can't seem to leave our baggage in the past."" This isn't the first time that Pakistan's founder has caused trouble for a Hindu nationalist. BJP President Lal Krishna Advani was forced to temporarily step down in 2005 for praising Jinnah's secularism during a trip to Pakistan. Political observers say the Singh controversy reflects a battle for the soul of the BJP, beleaguered by electoral defeats and vicious infighting. Many in India view the BJP as a divisive force attempting to gain power by exploiting Hindu-Muslim tensions. Advani was charged in the 1992 demolition of the 16th-century Babri mosque in the central Indian city of Ayodhya, though he was later acquitted in that case. Journalist K.G. Suresh, a longtime observer of conservative politics in India, said the BJP is struggling to figure out how to stay electable, whether to move right or stay closer to the center. ""Jaswant Singh's book is a manifestation of that clash,"" Suresh said. Singh's political climb is likely over, but what of younger Indians, now generations removed from those who remember independence? Tejpal for one, senses the wounds could keep reopening. And that, he said, ""doesn't bode well.""","Home state of  Mahatma Gandhi bans revisionist history of India-Pakistan partition .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A key House committee passed comprehensive health care reform legislation Friday, moving President Obama's domestic priority one step closer to congressional approval. Speaker Nancy Pelosi says House Democrats will return to their districts ready to defend the bill. The vote occurred as the House of Representatives adjourned for its August recess. The 31-28 vote in the House Energy and Commerce Committee came after several days of intense and often contentious negotiations between Democratic House leaders and an influential group of fiscal conservatives in the party. Three members of the Democrats' conservative Blue Dog caucus -- John Barrow of Georgia, Jim Matheson of Utah and Charlie Melancon of Louisiana -- voted against the bill, along with two other Democrats, Bart Stupak of Michigan and Rick Boucher of Virginia. The committee's bill will now be merged with two separate versions passed by other House panels before being considered by the full chamber in September. The prospects for health care reform in the full House, however, remain unclear. Democrats remain deeply divided, with a number of liberals expressing strong opposition to concessions made to the party's so-called Blue Dog conservatives on the Energy and Commerce Committee. The fate of health care reform also remains uncertain in the Senate, where the Finance Committee recently postponed its long-awaited vote on a bipartisan compromise plan until after the August recess. The coming fights in both chambers serve as a backdrop for what is expected to be a month of furious campaigning for and against the bill as members of Congress meet with constituents back home over the break. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday that House Democrats will return to their districts with talking points and memos to help them rebut opponents running ""a shock and awe campaign ... to perpetuate the status quo."" ""Facts mean nothing"" to insurance industry executives and others opposed to change, she said. ""Misrepresentation is the currency of their realm."" Pelosi did not indicate, however, how Democratic divisions in the House might be overcome when Congress returns in the fall. On Thursday, 57 members of the House Progressive Caucus sent a letter to Pelosi and others complaining that the agreement with the Blue Dogs weakened language creating a government-funded health insurance option. ""Any bill that does not provide, at a minimum, for a public option with reimbursement rates based on Medicare rates -- not negotiated rates -- is unacceptable,"" the letter said. The revised bill calls for the government-run public insurance option to be reimbursed on rates determined by negotiations with the insurance industry. The original version called for the same reimbursement rates as in the government's Medicare program for senior citizens. The progressive Democrats also argued that cuts to the bill's overall price would shortchange subsidies meant to help low- and moderate-income Americans buy health insurance. Some of those concerns were addressed Friday when the Energy and Commerce committee boosted funding for subsidies and added a provision empowering the federal government to directly negotiate prescription drug rates in the public plan. The agreement with the Blue Dogs, estimated to lower the cost of the House plan by $100 billion over a decade, would also exempt businesses with payrolls below $500,000 from having to provide health coverage to employees. ""We can compromise no more,"" warned Rep. Lynn Woolsey, co-chair of the 81-member Progressive Caucus. ""When leaders of the House meet ... to consider the three bills and produce a final one, we expect that it will retain a robust public option. If it doesn't, we will vote against it."" Opposition from progressive Democrats and some conservative House Democrats who want additional cost cuts could defeat the bill. Pelosi admitted that she preferred the original bill, but noted that much of the new language matched a proposal supported by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Massachusetts, a longtime champion of health care reform who is revered by liberal Democrats. She also pointed out that the bill could change when the House and Senate negotiate a final measure in coming months. On the Senate side, key Republicans in the Finance Committee negotiations said Wednesday that they were unlikely to complete work on a compromise plan before the August break. Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa and Sen. Michael Enzi of Wyoming said too many issues remained unresolved to sign on to a deal by the time the Senate breaks for its recess on August 7. On Thursday, Grassley said pressure from the White House and Democratic leaders to speed the process didn't help. ""It would be better for me to say that instead of saying there's no way we can cut a deal, there's no way we can get all the compromising that needs to be done by an artificial deadline of Friday of this week,"" Grassley said. ""So we're going to continue to work together this week and next week. But we're getting close."" Democrats had hoped the Finance Committee could finish its work before the August break to show progress toward health legislation. CNN's Craig Broffman and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","Bill passes 31-28 in House Energy and Commerce Committee before recess .

"(CNN) -- Investigators have heard a signal from the flight data recorders of the Yemenia Airways plane that crashed last week, they announced Sunday. Search parties continue their operation to locate the Yemenia Airbus A310 off the Comoros Islands Saturday. ""A signal was picked up from two acoustic transmitters from the plane's flight data recorders during a sea search to locate the data recorders this morning,"" the French air accident investigation agency, known as the BEA, said in a statement. Commonly known as ""black boxes,"" the data recorders should contain information to help determine what caused the crash. The Yemenia Airways Airbus 310 crashed into the Indian Ocean early Tuesday, carrying 142 passengers and 11 crew members. It originated in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, and went down just miles from Moroni, the capital of the Comoros Islands. One person, a 13-year-old French girl, survived. Bahia Basari, who lives in Marseille, escaped with cuts to her face and a fractured collarbone.  Watch teen survivor from crash » . The teen's father, Kassim Bakari, told a French radio network that his wife and daughter were flying to Comoros to visit relatives. ""When I had her on the phone, I asked her what happened and she said, 'Daddy, I don't know what happened, but the plane fell into the water and I found myself in the water... surrounded by darkness. I could not see anyone,'"" Bakari told France Info. The head of the rescue team in the Comoros told French radio RTL that the teenager beat astonishing odds to survive. ""It is truly, truly, miraculous,"" Ibrahim Abdoulazeb said. ""The young girl can barely swim."" Another rescuer told France's Europe 1 radio that the girl was spotted in the rough sea, among bodies and plane debris in darkness, about two hours after the crash. The Airbus 310 plane tried to land at the airport in Moroni, then made a U-turn before it crashed, Comoros Vice President Idi Nadhoim said soon after the accident. A French official said the nation had banned the plane after it failed an aviation inspection in 2007. ""Since this check-up, we have not seen the plane reappearing in France,"" said Dominique Bussereau, the transport minister. But Yemenia Airlines was not on the European Union's list of banned airlines, he added. Passengers on the flight included 66 French citizens, 54 Comorians, one Palestinian and one Canadian, according to Yemeni and French officials. The crew was made up of six Yemenis, two Moroccans, one Ethiopian, one Filipino and one Indonesian.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It carries the nickname ""America's Finest City,"" and right now it appears San Diego is living up to the hype. Growing on the water: San Diego is becoming an increasingly popular super-yacht destination. Though the international financial crisis has precipitated economic woe across the United States, developments in San Diego's super-yacht industry don't appear to be slowing. Fifth Avenue Landing, a stylish new facility promising the ultimate docking experience for super-yachts up to 300 feet long, has just opened in city's downtown area. The marina, which is close to local attractions and top hotels, boasts 12 high-quality berths, each offering a concierge service. This impressive project is just the latest step in a significant development program for the west coast city, which is which is now beginning to compete with its northern neighbor, Los Angeles, as a destination for super-yacht owners. In 2005, Forbes rated San Diego as the fifth wealthiest city in the U.S. and in the years since, for the super-yacht industry particularly, the region has continued to develop rapidly. Today, the city is buzzing with super-yacht designers, builders, and brokers, and it now has plenty of facilities to accommodate the industry. There's also the annual ""YachtFest"" show, which will be going ahead in September this year and is expected to attract interest from super-yacht makers and owners around the world. Numerous marinas have sprung up amid the increasing interest in the city, with Kona Kai Marina, Shelter Island Marina, and The Wharf, among some of the most notable developments. Outside of the private super-yacht industry, San Diego is also home to the largest shipyard on the west coast of the U.S. -- General Dynamics' National Steel and Shipbuilding Company. Many cruise lines pass through the port and there are plans for a new cruise ship terminal to open in 2010. Much of the success in attracting super-yachts has been credited to the San Diego Super-yacht Association (SDSA) -- a collective of local super-yacht designers, builders, brokers and other interested parties that was formed in 2006. Super-yacht director of Marine Group Boat Works and founding member of the SDSA, Fred Larsson, told CNN that the key to San Diego's recent profile boost was realizing the economic needs of the industry. ""San Diego had the basic requirements of super-yachts covered already with the natural deep water harbor, year round superb weather, geographic location as the gateway to the Pacific and a wonderful youthful city. Then when you add the super-yacht facility upgrades it's a no brainer. San Diego has it all,"" he said. Larsson said the SDSA had been instrumental in developments as the combination of shipyards, marinas and suppliers working together means they have a good all-round knowledge of what super-yacht owners want when they come to port. The combination of major refit facility improvements, new marinas, marina expansions and an effective marketing campaign are behind the success, he added. Despite the international financial crisis, which threatens to hurt the super-yacht industry around the world, Larsson said that San Diego should not suffer too much as interest from owners is still growing. ""Due to the sheer size of the city and nearby cities there is so much for owners and crew to do here on their time off, the beaches are fabulous, Vegas is an hour away, there are 100 golf courses in and around San Diego. ""It's a metropolitan feel with small town charm. That's what makes us different,"" he said.","A new super-yacht docking facility has recently opened in San Diego .

"CABANATUAN CITY, Philippines (CNN) -- Typhoon Parma crossed the northern tip of the already storm-battered Philippines Saturday afternoon and early Sunday, killing three people, according to local media. A NASA satellite image shows Typhoon Parma as it headed toward the Philippines on Friday. Parma made landfall Saturday afternoon in a rural region of fishermen and farmers in Luzon, the largest of the Philippine islands. Tens of thousands of people to fled their homes for safer shelter. Winds whipped the coastline and felled power lines in northernmost Cagayan Province. Debris littered the roads, making evacuations even more difficult. At 5 a.m. Sunday (5 p.m. Saturday ET), Parma, known locally as Typhoon Pepeng, had maximum sustained winds of 120 kilometers per hour (75 mph) with gusts as high as 148 kilometers (92 mph) as the eye began to leave land, heading to the northeast, according to the U.S. Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Parma avoided a direct hit on heavily populated Manila, but the real menace in the Philippines capital was not wind. It was water, and there was no escape from it. Parma was expected to dump as much as 8 to 20 inches of rain in areas still water-logged from last week's Typhoon Ketsana. That storm resulted in the heaviest rainfall in 40 years and at one point, 80 percent of Manila was submerged. Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro appealed to Filipinos to remain in shelters even if they were in cities and towns not directly in Parma's path. He said he was worried about massive flooding and possible mudslides in mountainous regions. The government deployed 10,000 troops to help with rescue and relief operations as frightened Filipinos prepared for the worst. World Vision, the Christian humanitarian organization, was planning to launch relief operations Saturday evening in Isabela Province, one of the areas slammed by Parma. The group also plans assistance for nearby Cagayan province, whose capital, Tuguegarao, is being hit hard by Parma's strong winds. Arturo Fidelino, a telecommunications executive in Manila, described panicked people rushing to stock up on essential goods -- drinking water, canned food and electrical supplies. ""We had a traumatic experience when we had Ketsana,"" he said. ""We don't want that to happen again."" President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo placed the country ""under the state of calamity."" Macapagal-Arroyo said disaster-relief crews in vulnerable areas must be equipped with life-saving kits, boats, portable generators and trucks. Ketsana, which swallowed whole houses and buses over the weekend, killed 246 in the Philippines. It later strengthened into a typhoon. An additional 38 are missing, the National Disaster Coordinating Council said. The storm affected nearly 2 million people and forced the evacuation of 567,000.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is asking parents to immediately stop using a series of inflatable floats for babies in swimming pools, announcing a voluntary recall of about 4 million floats Thursday. The Squirtin' Tootin' Tugboat is among the floats covered by the recall. The items -- which inflate to seat babies and toddlers as they float on water -- are manufactured by Massachusetts-based Aqua Leisure Industries. The company has voluntarily recalled 14 models because the leg straps in the seat of the float can tear, causing children to slip into the water, posing a drowning risk, the commission said in a statement. There have been 31 reports of float seats tearing, though no injuries have been reported, the commission said. The floats were sold from December 2002 through June 2009 at retailers nationwide, including Target, Toys ""R"" Us, Wal-Mart, Dollar General, Kmart, Walgreens, Ace Hardware and Bed, Bath & Beyond.

"RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (CNN) -- Thousands of people celebrated Friday on crowded Copacabana beach as the announcement that Brazil had been chosen as the 2016 Olympics host played live over huge screens erected above the sand. Thousands packed Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro after the city learned it will host the Olympics. ""It was a fantastic victory. We beat the big cities. Passion talked louder,"" said one man as he danced to live samba music in front of the stage. Rio de Janeiro beat out Chicago, Tokyo and Madrid to become the first South American city to host the Games, something President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva made clear during his pitch to the International Olympic Committee. ""It is a time to address this imbalance,"" he told committee members making the selection in Copenhagen, Denmark. ""It is time to light the Olympic cauldron in a tropical country."" Happiness was a big part of Rio's pitch after it was voted the happiest city in the world by Forbes magazine. On Friday, thousands of people piled onto the beach wearing green and yellow, many with the Brazilian flag painted on their faces.  Exuberant Rio de Janeiro is first South American city to host Olympics » . ""I thought that more than to the people, we owe this victory to our President Lula,"" said a woman wearing little more than a bikini. Rio also won points with an ambitious budget and new venues like the Joao Havelange Stadium, which opened for the 2007 Pan American Games. Rio's jaw-dropping natural beauty helped the city pull ahead of the competition.

""In Rio, it's about taking each day as it comes and living life to the fullest."" Erik Torkells, editor for TripAdvisor, the world's largest online travel community, also praised the city for its social scene before the selection was made. ""If the Olympic Committee wanted to be sure everyone had a good time, they'd go to Rio,"" Torkells said. The selection also had its critics in Brazil. ""I don't think it's appropriate considering what our country is going through,"" said Orlando Pinto, a social worker. ""We don't have good health services, education; we have transportation problems, housing problems, crime problems."" Security and traffic remain enormous challenges to overcome in Rio de Janeiro.

"(CNN) -- Americans appear to actually thrive on adversity, according to a study published this week that reached the conclusion after researching the nation's biggest economic downturn. This sculpture at the FDR Memorial in Washington depicts men waiting in a Great Depression bread line. Life expectancy during the peak years of the Great Depression increased 6.2 years -- from 57.1 years in 1929 to 63.3 years in 1933 -- according to University of Michigan researchers Jose A. Tapia Granados and Ana Diez Roux. The increase applied to men and women, whites and non-whites. The team crunched data from the federal government and concluded that ""population health did not decline and indeed generally improved during the four years of the Great Depression, 1930-1933, with mortality decreasing for almost all ages, and life expectancy increasing by several years in males, females, whites, and non-whites."" For most age groups, ""mortality tended to peak during years of strong economic expansion (such as 1923, 1926, 1929 and 1936-1937),"" they wrote in the ""Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences."" ""The finding is strong and counterintuitive,"" said Tapia Granados, the lead author of the study. ""Most people assume that periods of high unemployment are harmful to health."" The researchers used historical life expectancy and mortality data to examine the association between economic growth and population health from 1920 to 1940. Though population health improved during 1930-1933 and during the recessions of 1921 and 1938, mortality -- the death rate -- increased and life expectancy fell during times of economic expansion, such as 1923, 1926, 1929 and 1936-1937, they wrote. The researchers looked at mortality rates due to six causes of death that made up two-thirds of total mortality in the 1930s: cardiovascular and kidney diseases, cancer, influenza and pneumonia, tuberculosis, motor vehicle injuries and suicide. Only suicide went up during economic downturns, they said, citing the recession years 1921, 1932 and 1938, but suicides accounted for less than 2 percent of total deaths. Those years were marked by high unemployment; the nation experienced its highest unemployment rate of 22.9 percent in 1932, they wrote. Yet from 1920 to 1940, life expectancy increased 8.8 years. The authors speculated about possible explanations for why population health tends to improve during recessions but not expansions. ""During expansions, firms are very busy, and they typically demand a lot of effort from employees, who are required to work a lot of overtime, and to work at a fast pace,"" Tapia Granados said. ""This can create stress, which is associated with more drinking and smoking."" In addition, new, inexperienced workers may be more likely to become injured; workers may sleep less and adopt less healthy eating habits, he said. Further, boom times may translate into more industrial pollution, which can take a toll on populations' health, he said. During recessions, with less work to do, employees may work slower, sleep longer and spend more time with family and friends, he said. With less money, they may spend less on alcohol and tobacco. The researchers pointed out that their work looked at the relationship between recessions and mortality on a macro level and was not predictive for any one person. The findings may apply to others, too. Tapia Granados, 53, whose work was self-funded, said he has carried out similar studies that looked at Japan, Spain and Sweden. ""In the three of them, it was the same,"" he said.","Study: Life expectancy rose, mortality dropped during Great Depression .

"(CNN) -- Looking directly at the man who murdered his 9-year-old daughter, Mark Lunsford told John Evander Couey, ""I hope you hear her cry as you try to sleep at night."" ""You will never hurt another child again,"" Lunsford said in testimony Tuesday in a Florida court hearing where a judge will decide whether to give Couey the death penalty. Jessica Lunsford, seen in an undated family photo, was 9 when she was abducted and killed. She disappeared in 2005 from her home in Homosassa, Florida. His eyes fixed on Couey, Lunsford continued, ""For 29 months, my daughter has heard me cry and begged God to stop the pain in my heart."" Addressing Florida Circuit Court Judge Ric Howard, Lunsford pleaded for Couey to die for his crime. Then he turned back to the man who took his daughter.  Watch Lunsford's emotional testimony » . ""I hope you see the tears at night when she asked you [if she could] go home. You will never hurt another child again."" Lunsford spent much time talking about memories of Jesse Lunsford. ""I can remember when she was about 1 year old and would give me kisses and hugs and steal the raisins from my cereal,"" he said. ""From bumps to bruises, from Band-Aids to bicycles, she was a tomboy with her daddy and a very nice little lady for her grandmother."" The hearing will continue Wednesday. Couey's attorneys are trying to convince Howard that Couey is mentally incompetent and should be spared the death penalty. ""That's a cop-out,"" Lunsford said Tuesday on Larry King Live. ""He is not retarded."" The father said he wants Couey to die for his crime. King asked him if he would attend the execution by lethal injection. ""I'd hold the syringe if they'd let me,"" he answered. But a prosecution expert testified Tuesday that the convicted killer had an IQ of between 80 and 90, about low average. ""My opinion is that he is not mentally retarded,"" said Dr. Greg Pritchard, a clinical psychologist. Couey was convicted in March on charges of kidnapping, raping and murdering Jessica. The jury voted 10-2 to recommend the death penalty. In Florida, the vote does not have to be unanimous to recommend the death penalty. The judge is expected to sentence Couey next month. Jessica Lunsford disappeared in February 2005 from her home in Homosassa. Her body was found three weeks later in a shallow grave outside a mobile home about 100 yards from where she lived. Couey, a convicted sex offender, was staying nearby in a trailer with his half-sister. Couey kidnapped the girl from her bedroom and later, in a taped confession, admitted that he buried the child alive. ""I went out there one night and dug a hole and put her in it. Buried her,"" he said. She was found wrapped in garbage bags, holding a stuffed toy dolphin, her hands bound with stereo wire. Jessica died from asphyxiation after being sexually assaulted, according to a medical examiner's report. The judge ruled the confession was inadmissible in court because Couey had asked for a lawyer the day before he told police he committed the crime. Evidence at the trial included Jessica's fingerprints in a closet in Couey's trailer and DNA from Jessica's blood and Couey's semen on a mattress in his bedroom. Lunsford has led a push for stricter sex offender laws since his daughter's death. Then-Gov. Jeb Bush signed the Jessica Lunsford Act into Florida law. The 2005 legislation calls for prison sentences of 25 years to life for sex offenses against children under age 12, better registration of convicted sex offenders and a Global Positioning System notification mechanism to track down probation violators. Texas Gov. Rick Perry signed similar legislation Monday. E-mail to a friend .","Mark Lunsford testifies at sentencing hearing for 9-year-old daughter's killer .

"(CNN) -- The number of people killed by a typhoon that slammed into Taiwan and China earlier this month continues to rise, Taiwan announced Thursday. Tsai Sung Yu holds photos of his mother, brother, sister-in-law and niece who were all killed in the mudslides. At least 543 people are now known to have died when Typhoon Morakot hit Taiwan, the country's Central Emergency Operation Center said Thursday. At least 117 people are still missing, and at least 46 people were injured. Emergency services also reported that 60 human limbs had been found, separately from the number of dead and wounded. Kaohsiung county was the worst hit, with 472 dead, 72 missing and 13 hurt, one seriously, the emergency center said. Morakot dropped 102 inches of rain on Taiwan August 8 before it roared on to mainland China the next day. More than 1.4 million people in China were forced to relocate because of the storm and more than 6,000 homes were destroyed. At least six people were killed there, China's Ministry of Civil Affairs said after the storm passed. Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou apologized last week for the slow response to the typhoon. He said he plans sweeping changes to the country's rescue agencies and may punish some government officials. ""We will try our best to do a better job in the rescue work that has been criticized for being too slow,"" said Ma. ""There are things that we have to correct and we also will be responsible for whatever mistakes or neglect that government officials have made."" Rescuers have struggled to locate many who were missing in remote mountainous areas of southern Taiwan. Ma also apologized a week earlier for failings of the rescue effort as he traveled around the typhoon-battered island. He said heavy rain grounded rescue helicopters in the first few days after the storm hit, delaying relief efforts. Ma said the storm destroyed buildings, homes, roads and farms, causing about NT$100 billion (U.S. $3 billion) in damage.

"(CNN) -- In an unusual step, NASA scientists interrupted testing of the refurbished Hubble Space Telescope to aim the orbiter's camera at Jupiter and capture an image of the planet's mysterious new scar. The revamped Hubble telescope captured these images of an impact scar near Jupiter's south pole. The resulting picture, taken Thursday, is the sharpest visible-light photo of the dark spot and Hubble's first science observation since astronauts repaired and upgraded it in May, NASA said. Earth-based telescopes have been trained on Jupiter since an amateur astronomer in Australia noticed the new mark, probably created when a small comet or asteroid plunged into Jupiter's atmosphere and disintegrated, early Monday. But in its rarified orbit 347 miles above the Earth, the Hubble has a better view of the gaseous planet. This week's event marks only the second time scientists have recorded debris colliding with Jupiter, the fifth planet from the sun and the largest in our solar system. The appearance of the impact spot is changing day to day in the planet's cloud tops, making it a priority for scientists to document it quickly. Although the Hubble is not expected to resume full operations until late summer and its new camera is still being calibrated, NASA scientists decided the Jupiter event was too significant not to put the orbiting observatory back into action for a day. ""Because we believe this magnitude of impact is rare, we are very fortunate to see it with Hubble,"" said Amy Simon-Miller of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. ""Details seen in the Hubble view shows a lumpiness to the debris plume caused by turbulence in Jupiter's atmosphere."" Jupiter's colorful atmosphere is 86 percent hydrogen and 14 percent helium, with tiny amounts of methane, ammonia, phosphine, water, acetylene, ethane, germanium and carbon monoxide. The chemicals are responsible for producing the different colors of Jupiter's clouds. The object created a mark on Jupiter that has about same diameter as Earth, though the object itself was probably only 50 to 100 miles across, said Anthony Wesley, the astronomer who first noticed the scar. The mystery object was probably moving at speeds of about 50 to 100 kilometers (31 to 62 miles) per second when it struck near Jupiter's south pole, Wesley said. The new image of Jupiter was taken with Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3, which was installed by the astronauts aboard space shuttle Atlantis in May. Because it is still being calibrated, the camera's full power has yet to be seen, NASA said. The Hubble has been in orbit since 1990 and can capture images that telescopes on Earth can't, partly because it doesn't have to gaze through the planet's murky atmosphere. The unplanned Jupiter photo shoot will add delays to the recommissioning of Hubble, NASA said. But scientists are at a point in the telescope's reboot where they have enough flexibility to employ Hubble to look at the unexpected astronomical event, they said.","Revamped Hubble telescope captured image of Jupiter's mysterious new scar .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The body of a woman who authorities say was impaired by marijuana and alcohol when she caused a deadly head-on collision shows no signs of long-term alcohol use, according to an investigator hired by her family. Diane Schuler's minivan was heading the wrong direction as the wreck happened, police said. ""I have looked at the autopsy, and the pancreas, liver and esophagus were clear,"" Tom Ruskin, lead investigator and president of CMP Protective and Investigative Group, told CNN. ""I've never seen a case like this. No one has seen this woman drunk and we have interviewed over 50 people -- relatives, friends, colleagues and former employees from her company."" The Westchester County medical examiner's office found that Diane Schuler, 36, had a blood alcohol level of .19 percent -- more than twice the legal limit -- and had marijuana in her system when she drove a minivan the wrong way on the Taconic State Parkway and ran head-on into an SUV. Three adults in the SUV were killed in the July 26 crash, along with Schuler and four children in her minivan -- her daughter and three nieces. A fifth child, Schuler's son, survived and is in stable condition. Ruskin, a former officer in New York Police's narcotics division, said he is hesitant to fully accept the autopsy report. ""I'm not saying the autopsy is wrong or right. I don't know if she smoked pot weeks prior. Marijuana stays in your system for up to 30 days,"" he said. The medical examiner's office released a statement on August 6, saying it stands by its autopsy results, and reiterated that Sunday. Schuler's family expressed shock when the details were revealed, saying she had no history of substance use. ""There's no way she'd do this,"" Jay Schuler, Schuler's sister-in-law, said earlier this month. ""She was responsible."" Tests revealed that Schuler had an additional six grams of alcohol in her stomach that had yet to be metabolized, according to Maj. William Carey of the New York State Police. A vodka bottle was also found in the vehicle after the crash. Ruskin is adamant that it is necessary to go back through the day of the crash. ""We are analyzing all of the data that we have to date. We have a staff that has consumed themselves with this case,"" he said. ""We are trying to determine what happened here."" Schuler's husband, Daniel, ""would like to remind people that no matter what happened here he lost his wife, his daughter, his nieces and he also grieves for the Bastardi and Luongo families,"" Ruskin said, referring to the other crash victims.

"(CNN) -- For someone who seems to go to great lengths to keep his private life away from prying eyes, late-night talk show host David Letterman has seen a great deal of his personal life become public. David Letterman has mined private events in his life for very public jokes on his show. Heart problems, a troubled stalker and a plot to kidnap his son have all landed Letterman in the news and provided fodder for jokes, including some of his own. The latest, an alleged extortion attempt involving his sexual dalliances (it's been dubbed ""sextortion"" by pundits), was handled very much the way Letterman fans might expect: with humor and a bit of storytelling. ""He told it as a story that you felt like you were living along with him, and so I think he immediately won your sympathy by telling it that way,"" said Hal Boedeker, TV critic for the Orlando Sentinel. ""He also took the seedy factor out of it with restraint by not saying too much and trying to protect the people he was involved with.""  Watch Letterman tell what happened » . Letterman revealed on his show Thursday night that he'd had sexual relations with members of his staff and that he had testified about those liaisons before a New York grand jury for a case involving the alleged attempted extortion. A CBS producer, Robert ""Joe"" Halderman, has been charged with first-degree attempted grand larceny; officials said he threatened to go public with the 62-year-old funnyman's dalliances unless Letterman paid $2 million. Halderman pleaded not guilty Friday. The revelation, which Letterman shared with the audience of the ""Late Show,"" seemed especially shocking given his reputation as the self-deprecating everyman. ""Letterman picked up on [that shock] and played on that,"" said Robert Thompson, a professor and founding director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University. ""It was the weirdest 10 minutes of television I've seen in a long time, and yet I think I've concluded that it was brilliant.""  Watch ""Larry King Live"" guest host Jim Moret talk to panel about Letterman case » . Letterman has had plenty of experience dealing with awkward, and sometimes painful, episodes on television. Beginning in the 1980s, he was stalked by Margaret Ray, a woman with schizophrenia who often broke into his New Canaan, Connecticut, home, wrote him letters and once stole his Porsche. Letterman would sometimes joke about her -- without using her name -- on his show and told The New York Times that was because he joked about every public aspect of his life. Ray would refer to herself as ""Mrs. David Letterman"" and once watched the talk show host and his now-wife Regina Lasko from a hallway in their home as they lay in bed. Ray committed suicide in 1998; Letterman offered his condolences on-air to her family. Though Letterman was quoted as saying Ray's actions were usually more odd than frightening, a plot in 2005 to kidnap his then-toddler son proved to be more alarming. Kelly A. Frank, an ex-con who had done some work at Letterman's Deep Creek Ranch in Montana, was charged with planning to kidnap Letterman's son, Harry, and his nanny. Frank pleaded guilty to lesser charges and was sentenced to 10 years in jail. In 2007, he escaped and was later captured. Thompson said Letterman has shown that he is able to rise above his troubles, including emergency bypass surgery in 2000, with a healthy dose of comedy. This latest incident was no different, Thompson observed. ""The interesting thing is that he never went out of comic mode,"" Thompson said. ""His magnum opus was when he was the first late-night comedian to come back after September 11th ... and he did it brilliantly. All of the other comics who came on in the following weeks followed him exactly."" He kept Thursday's tale so light, Thompson said, that many who may not have been aware of the news would have thought it was just another Letterman bit. ""I think he realized that we are so cynical and so disbelieving of this long string of people apologizing for stuff like this,"" Thompson said. ""We don't believe it anymore, and we think they are only doing it for public relations. But he didn't handle it that way, and he delivered it in such a way that it came across as light-hearted and sincere."" Glenn Selig, founder of the Publicity Agency, said that from a crisis-management perspective, Letterman handled his most recent incident well. ""I think the fact that he put it out there in his own way, in his own terms with the timing that he wanted to do it, that was the best way to go,"" Selig said. ""He tried to interject some humor and self-deprecation into it, which I think takes the wind out of those who may have tried to knock him down, because he was already knocking himself down."" And although more intimate, and embarrassing, details may be revealed as the case continues, critic Boedeker said he thinks Letterman, his show and his career will come out well. ""I think his fans are, for the most part, pretty forgiving,"" Boedeker said. ""He's always made fun of himself and his looks. It's not as if he has set himself up as some paragon of virtue, and I really don't think this will hurt him in the long run."" A representative for Letterman's company, Worldwide Pants, said, ""All the relationships David Letterman was referencing when discussing the matter on the 'Late Show' predated his marriage to Regina"" in March.","Alleged plot against David Letterman isn't first time private woes made public .

"(CNN) -- It was still dark when Stan Brock began calling out numbers on his megaphone to admit a crowd of hundreds gathered at a Los Angeles sports arena Tuesday morning. A mobile health clinic offering free services has drawn thousands of people in Los Angeles in the last week. ""We opened the door at 5:30 and there were 600-odd people already gathered,"" he told CNN. Over the last week, thousands seeking free medical care have turned up at the mobile health care clinic set up by Remote Area Medical, a non-profit organization founded by Brock. Tuesday marks the final day of its eight-day operation in Los Angeles, which so far has resulted in the provision of at least $2 million in free health care services, according to Brock's early estimates. Remote Area Medical, better known as RAM, is a volunteer organization that brings free medical, dental and vision care to people around the world.  See other groups that provide much-needed health services » . Since its launch in 1985, RAM has sent expeditions to developing corners of the world, including Haiti, the Dominican Republic and India. But in recent years, the Knoxville, Tenn.-based organization has faced increasing demand for its services in the U.S., including from large urban areas. ""We've had to cut back on services to needy places like Haiti because of overwhelming need in the U.S.,"" Brock told CNN. ""We have to take care of the home front first."" On the final day of the Los Angeles operation, Brock said crowds were still gathering with the hope of receiving care. Patients have spent hours waiting in line in the past week for the chance to get free care. RAM has had to turn away some patients because it didn't have enough volunteers to provide treatment. It hasn't reached its target of treating 1,500 patients a day, but Brock still considers the operation a success. He said RAM has treated at least 4,557 people, and that doesn't include figures from the last two days of the operation, which aren't available yet, he said. Many patients have used more than one service, resulting in roughly 11,500 patient encounters. That includes the extraction of nearly 1,800 bad teeth and the production of 1,090 pairs of new eyeglasses. While limited access to health care is often associated with developing countries, it's a problem that faces patients around the world. That's become increasingly clear as America debates the future of health care. Los Angeles is by far the largest urban community RAM has served so far. The organization has been besieged for requests from a number of metro areas, including Detroit, Seattle, Miami and Atlanta, Brock said. The lack of accessible health care from an economic standpoint is a problem that has been going on for decades, Brock said. ""We could have come to Los Angeles 15 years ago and I guarantee there would have been just as big of a turnout of patients,"" he told CNN. Brock started RAM after spending 15 years in what used to be British Guiana -- now known as Guyana -- in South America. In that isolated area, it would take 26 days on foot to reach care, Brock recalled, and he wanted to find a way to bring medical care to such remote areas. RAM usually provides services in the Appalachia region of the U.S. where it's easier for volunteers to work, Brock said. Medical practitioners providing free care in Tennessee can be licensed in any state. Unfortunately, he said, other states don't have similar provisions, making it difficult for RAM to recruit enough local volunteers to be able to deal with the demand if they were to set up in areas like New York or Washington. Running the temporary clinic is practically a 24-hour operation. Brock's day starts at 4 a.m. and runs well into the night. But it's a rewarding experience for volunteers when they get to see how much their efforts have been appreciated, he said. ""When you see a patient who has had thousands of dollars of free dental care come out of a dental chair and they've got tears in their eyes and hug the dentist and dental assistant, it makes it all worthwhile.""","Pop-up clinic in Los Angeles has treated at least 4,500 patients in last week .

"(CNN) -- A Sri Lankan court sentenced a journalist Monday to serve 20 years in prison for articles that criticized the military, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission. Tamil journalist J. S. Tissainayagam is led from court after being sentenced. ""The AHRC is not surprised by this judgment because at the very inception of this case, the AHRC pointed out that this is purely a political case,"" the commission said in a statement. J.S. Tissainayagam, the editor of a monthly magazine, was arrested in March 2008 for printing articles critical of the Sri Lankan military's treatment of civilians during the country's war on the Tamil Tiger rebel group, according to several human rights groups. The Tamil journalist was held without charge for several months, prompting outrage from human rights and press freedom organizations. He was later charged under the country's controversial Prevention of Terrorism Act. His case has drawn international attention to the plight of press freedom in Sri Lanka, which ended its decades-long war against the Tamil rebels earlier this year. The country's military has been accused of numerous atrocities against civilians during the final months of the 26-year conflict. Sri Lanka has denied the accusations, and routinely rejects calls by human rights groups for independent investigations into its campaign against the Tigers. U.S. President Barack Obama mentioned Tissainayagam in his May 1 statement on World Press Freedom Day: . ""In every corner of the globe, there are journalists in jail or being actively harassed: from Azerbaijan to Zimbabwe, Burma to Uzbekistan, Cuba to Eritrea. Emblematic examples of this distressing reality are figures like J.S. Tissainayagam in Sri Lanka, or Shi Tao and Hu Jia in China."" The Asian Human Rights Commission condemned Monday's sentence as ""the most glaring proof of the absence of freedom of expression in Sri Lanka."" It called on Sri Lanka and the international community ""to condemn the judgment and the sentence in Tissainayagam's case and to call for his unconditional release.""","J.S.

"(CNN) -- A Dutch Court will decide the fate Friday of 13-year-old Laura Dekker, either making her a potential world-record-breaking sailor, or returning her to school. Laura Dekker will find out on Friday whether the Dutch Court will back her record attempt. Welfare services in the Netherlands have taken legal action to try to stop the teen from attempting to become the youngest person to sail solo around the world because they believe the voyage will be too dangerous. The Dutch Council for Child Protection has applied to the District Court in the city of Utrecht for Dekker to be made a ward of court so that her parents, who support her plans, temporarily lose the right to make decisions about her. Laura's father, Dick Dekker, has already had a request for her to miss two years of school turned down. However, CNN affiliate TVNZ reported that Laura, who was born off the coast of New Zealand and began sailing solo when she was 10, may attempt to obtain a Kiwi passport which would allow her to start her round the world trip from New Zealand shores instead.

"(CNN) -- Michael Jackson, the show-stopping singer whose best-selling albums -- including ""Off the Wall,"" ""Thriller"" and ""Bad"" -- and electrifying stage presence made him one of the most popular artists of all time, died Thursday, CNN has confirmed. Michael Jackson, shown in 2008, was one of the biggest pop stars in history. He was 50. He collapsed at his residence in the Holmby Hills section of Los Angeles, California, about noon Pacific time, suffering cardiac arrest, according to brother Randy Jackson. He died at UCLA Medical Center. Lt. Fred Corral of the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office said an autopsy would probably be done on the singer Friday, with results expected that afternoon.  Watch crowds gather at Jackson's hospital » . ""Michael Jackson made culture accept a person of color,"" the Rev. Al Sharpton said. ""To say an 'icon' would only give these young people in Harlem a fraction of what he was. He was a historic figure that people will measure music and the industry by."" Jackson's blazing rise to stardom -- and later fall from grace -- is among the most startling of show business tales. The son of a steelworker, he rose to fame as the lead singer of the Jackson 5, a band he formed with his brothers in the late 1960s. By the late '70s, as a solo artist, he was topping the charts with cuts from ""Off the Wall,"" including ""Rock With You"" and ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough.""

The pop music landscape was changing, however, opening up for rap, hip-hop and what came to be called ""alternative"" -- and Jackson was seen as out of step. His next release, 1991's ""Dangerous,"" debuted at No. 1 but ""only"" produced one top-ranking single -- ""Black or White"" -- and that song earned criticism for its inexplicably violent ending, in which Jackson was seen smashing car windows and clutching his crotch. And then ""Dangerous"" was knocked out of its No. 1 spot on the album charts by Nirvana's ""Nevermind,"" an occurrence noted for its symbolism by rock critics. After that, more attention was paid to Jackson's private life than his music career, which faltered. A 1995 two-CD greatest hits, ""HIStory,"" sold relatively poorly, given the huge expense of Jackson's recording contract: about 7 million copies, according to Recording Industry of America certifications. A 2001 album of new material, ""Invincible,"" did even worse. In 2005, he went to trial on child-molestation charges. He was acquitted. In July 2008, after three years away from the spotlight, Jackson announced a series of concerts at London's O2 Arena as his ""curtain call.""

Its success paved the way for ""Thriller,"" which eventually became the best-selling album in history, with 50 million copies sold worldwide. At that point, Michael Jackson became ubiquitous. Seven of ""Thriller's"" nine cuts were released as singles; all made the Top Ten.

But something about his electrifying performance of ""Billie Jean,"" complete with the patented backward dance moves, boosted his stardom to a new level.  Watch Jackson perform ""Thiller"" » . People copied his Jheri-curled hair and single-gloved, zippered-jacket look. Showbiz veterans such as Fred Astaire praised his chops. He posed for photos with Ronald and Nancy Reagan at the White House. Paul McCartney teamed with him on three duets, two of which -- ""The Girl Is Mine"" and ""Say Say Say"" -- became top five hits. Jackson became a Pepsi spokesman, and when his hair caught fire while making a commercial, it was worldwide news. It all happened very fast -- within a couple years of the Motown special. But even at the time of the ""Motown 25"" moonwalk, fame was old hat to Michael Jackson. He hadn't even turned 25 himself, but he'd been a star for more than half his life. He was given the nickname the ""King of Pop"" -- a spin on Elvis Presley's status as ""the King of Rock 'n' Roll"" -- and few questioned the moniker. Relentless attention . But, as the showbiz saying has it, when you're on top of the world, there's nowhere to go but down. The relentless attention given Jackson started focusing as much on his eccentricities -- some real, some rumored -- as his music. As the Web site Allmusic.com notes, he was rumored to sleep in a hyperbaric chamber and to have purchased the bones of John Merrick, the ""Elephant Man."" (Neither was true.) He did have a pet chimpanzee, Bubbles; underwent a series of increasingly drastic plastic surgeries; established an estate, Neverland, filled with zoo animals and amusement park rides; and managed to purchase the Beatles catalog from under Paul McCartney's nose, which displeased the ex-Beatle immensely. In 1990s and 2000s, Jackson found himself pasted across the media for his short-lived marriages, the first to Elvis Presley's daughter, Lisa Marie; his 2002 claim that then Sony Records head Tommy Mottola was racist; his behavior and statements during a 2003 interview with British journalist Martin Bashir done for a documentary called ""Living With Michael Jackson;"" his changing physical appearance; and, above all, the accusations that he sexually molested young boys at Neverland.  Watch report on legacy on Michael Jackson » . The first such accusation, in 1993, resulted in a settlement to the 13-year-old accuser (rumored to be as high as $20 million), though no criminal charges were filed, Allmusic.com notes. He also fell deeply in debt and was forced to sell some of his assets. Neverland was one of many holdings that went on the block. However, an auction of material from Neverland, scheduled for April, was called off and all items returned to Jackson. Interest in Jackson never faded, however, even if some of it was prurient. In 2008, when he announced 10 comeback shows in London, beginning in July 2009, the story made worldwide news. The number of concerts was later increased to 50. Seventy-five thousand tickets sold in four hours when they went on sale in March. However, when the shows were postponed until 2010, rumors swept the Internet that Jackson was not physically prepared and possibly suffering from skin cancer.

"(CNN) -- For the past decade, Microsoft researcher Gordon Bell has been moving the data from his brain onto computers -- where he knows it will be safe. Gordon Bell wearing a SenseCam, which automatically records photos throughout the day. Sure, you could say all of us do this to some extent. We save digital pictures from family events and keep tons of e-mail. But Bell, who is 75 years old, takes the idea of digital memory to a sci-fi-esque extreme. He carries around video equipment, cameras and audio recorders to capture his conversations, commutes, trips and experiences. Microsoft is working on a SenseCam that would hang around a person's neck and automatically capture every detail of life in photo form. Bell has given that a whirl. He also saves everything -- from restaurant receipts (he takes pictures of them) to correspondence, bills and medical records. He makes PDF files out of every Web page he views. In sum, this mountain of data -- more than 350 gigabytes worth, not including the streaming audio and video -- is a replica of Bell's biological memory. It's actually better, he says, because, if you back up your data in enough places, this digitized ""e-memory"" never forgets. It's like having a multimedia transcript of your life. By about 2020, he says, our entire life histories will be online and searchable. Location-aware smartphones and inexpensive digital memory storage in the ""cloud"" of the Internet make the transition possible and inevitable. No one will have to fret about storing the details of their lives in their heads anymore. We'll have computers for that. And this revolution will ""change what it means to be human,"" he writes. Bell, who, along with fellow researcher Jim Gemmell, is the author of a new book called ""Total Recall,"" talked with CNN about the advantages and drawbacks of recording one's life in painstaking digital detail. The following is an edited transcript. CNN: What have you learned about yourself through this process? That's been a really hard question to answer. ... The main driver of the recall turns out to be a [computer] screensaver or something where I go looking for [a digital memory] and I find something else. I guess it's the rich set of connections and people that I've been involved with. CNN: What do you use to record your memories? In a way, most of what happens during the day is sort of routine -- what you've done before. So I carry the SenseCam only when I think there's an episode or a sequence or a certain set of events that I want to capture and have automatically photographed. But I tend to always carry a camera with me. I live next to a fire station and I've got lots of photos of the hook and ladder coming out of the house. And I like food so I tend to photograph wonderfully presented food all the time. To me those are very pleasant memories. CNN: If we rely on computers instead of our brains, will humans become mentally sluggish? That's certainly one of the concerns. I tend to counter that theory. To me, I feel a lot freer. In a way I feel like I still remember all that stuff, but I generally remember that [the computer is] remembering something for me so I can find it. People have no memory of phone numbers now because of the cell phone -- their address book is in a cell phone. So I don't think they're getting any worse or any less facile about that. What an e-memory does, to me, is gives me a really wonderful free feeling. CNN: If we all record audio of our lives, do you think conversations will become stilted and fake? I think there will be a lot of court cases and lawyering around all of that. I'm personally less hung up about that. Certainly, people my age and Baby Boomers are. But the current X-Generation, [they think] this is pretty natural. CNN: Are you on Facebook and Twitter? Yeah, I'm on Facebook and Twitter and occasionally I will tweet something. Somehow my problem is that I don't think I have anything interesting to tweet about. CNN: Should all of our memories and observations be public? Absolutely not. Our own memories are our own private thing, and how much you choose to have on Facebook or blogs, that's your thing. CNN: What does your family think about your effort to record everything? Gradually, everybody is getting this idea. ... Think of it: You are a librarian for your life. Somebody has to be the family librarian. CNN: Are you worried about losing your memory? ... Forgetting is not a feature, it's a flaw. I don't think forgetting is an important feature of human memory. I think it's important to be able to remember things accurately. CNN: Are there any memories you deleted? No. When we were scanning stuff I had written a memo about a company, an unpleasant company -- probably the only company I was ever ashamed to be a part of. ... I put a note on that file that said, ""Don't ever scan or copy this!"" My assistant who was doing the scanning ran across this and said, ""What do you want me to do with this?"" And I said, ""Well, gee. This is my life."" I said, ""It's OK, just go ahead."" So it's all there. CNN: Do you think it's possible for people to turn away from new technologies? Or are advances like ""Total Recall"" inevitable? I think it's inevitable because so much content is being created. Virtually everything is coming in digitally -- everything from your photos to your videos to your music. ... I will love that day when the world is just bits. It's the ultimate in green, by the way.","Microsoft researcher Gordon Bell argues we will soon have searchable memories .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Madame Tussauds unveiled a wax figure of Michael Jackson on Thursday, showing the late entertainer in a pose from the concerts he had planned to hold this month. The new waxwork of Michael Jackson -- only Queen Elizabeth II has been portrayed more times by Madame Tussauds. Sculptors at the wax museum started working on the figure four months ago. They had intended to display it this month, to coincide with the start of Jackson's ""This is It"" comeback tour in London. The new figure is modeled on a Jackson pose from the concert poster, the museum said. It shows him ""arms outstretched, pelvis thrusting and tip-toed, with his trademark trilby angled forward,"" the museum said. It is the 13th Jackson waxwork by Madame Tussauds, the museum said. Only Britain's Queen Elizabeth II -- who has been on the throne for almost 60 years -- has been portrayed more often. ""It is extremely unusual for a personality to have been portrayed so many times,"" said Madame Tussauds spokeswoman Liz Edwards. ""But Michael Jackson was totally unique and his iconic status made him one of the most popular stars here."" The London museum has two other Jackson waxworks -- one in a pose from ""Thriller"" and another from his ""Dangerous"" album. The other 10 Jackson waxworks are in other Madame Tussauds museums around the world. The museum said it decided to proceed with the figure after Jackson's death last month ""as a tribute to one of the greatest musicians of all time and to celebrate his amazing 40-year career.""","Waxwork is the 13th of Jackson unveiled by the London tourist attraction .

"(CNN) -- A controversial exhibition featuring preserved corpses having sex opened Thursday in Germany's capital. Gunther von Hagens' controversial ""Body Works"" shows have traveled throughout the world. Part of his traveling ""Body Works"" exhibition, ""The Cycle of Life,"" is showing at Berlin's Postbahnhof and features 200 human bodies at various life stages -- from conception to old age, including embryos and fetuses taken from historic anatomical collections. In one exhibit a male body is lying on his back with a woman sitting astride him with her back towards his head. Torsten Woehlert, spokesman for Berlin's Culture Ministry, told CNN that there has already been a number of complaints from the public in the press, though none have come to the ministry itself. He said: ""As it is not against the law, only against good taste, there is not much the government could do anyway."" Conceived by Gunther von Hagens -- dubbed Dr. Death in Germany -- the exhibition displays the bodies with their muscles, nerves and tendons on show using a preservation technique he pioneered called plastination. This process involves replacing all body fluids and soluble fat with specially manufactured plastics. On his Web site, the anatomist describes the exhibition's purpose and goal ""to reveal and expose the anatomical structure of the human body and its function, in a unique lesson, and to teach us about the complexity of the human body, its anatomy, and the importance of leading a healthy way of life."" What do you think? He added that the source of the exhibition is from donors -- people, who during their lifetime, declared their willingness, by informed consent, to display their bodies at the exhibition for the ""benefit of education, health and the awareness of the wide public to the different systems of the human body."" When asked about the coupling of sex and death, von Hagens told Germany's Bild that ""death and sex are both taboo topics. I'm bringing them together. Death belongs to life."" He added that ""without sex no life would exist."" Von Hagens' work has divided opinion in the past, with critics often doubting his scientific motives and accusing him of shocking people to gain publicity. His public autopsy in 2002 for British broadcaster Channel 4 -- the first in the UK for 170 years -- received hundreds of complaints. The authorities also threatened to arrest him after declaring the procedure illegal. Von Hagens justified his actions as ""demystifying the post mortem examination,"" and likened the medical profession to ""medieval priests who would not allow ordinary people to read the Bible,"" The New Scientist reported.","Cycle of Life features 200 human bodies at various life stages .

"(CNN) -- You had a close encounter with a 40-yard-wide asteroid this week, but the astronomer who first spotted the large rock said it's nothing to worry about. An asteroid (inside circle) passed within 38,000 miles of Earth on Monday. Asteroid 2009 DD45 on Monday passed within 38,000 miles of Earth, less than twice the height of the geostationary satellites we depend on for communications, according to Robert McNaught of the Australian National University. McNaught, who watches for asteroids with his telescope 250 miles northwest of Sydney, Australia, discovered the approaching rock last week. ""It's not something to worry about, but something to be aware of,"" he said. While a direct hit on Earth could be a devastating natural disaster, McNaught said keeping track of asteroids can make a hit ""potentially preventable."" ""If discovered in advance and with enough lead time, there is the possibility of pushing it off course, if you have decades of advance warning,"" McNaught said. ""If you have only a few days, you can evacuate the area of impact, but there's not a great deal [else] you can do."" In either case, he said, a global catastrophe as depicted in Hollywood movies such as ""Deep Impact"" is ""very, very unlikely."" The 2009 DD45 asteroid circles the sun every 18 months, but its path will not threaten this planet at least for the next century, he said. The number of ""potentially harmful asteroids"" discovered each year has grown dramatically over the past decade as ""systematic programs"" to scan the skies have been put in place, McNaught said. Nearly 100 new ones have been found in each of the past several years, he said.","Asteroid passes within 38,000 miles of Earth on Monday, an astronomer says .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN)  -- About 200 people have been arrested in a flare-up of anti-Christian violence in Gojra that left seven dead, a government minister said Monday. Christians in Karachi, Pakistan, on Monday protest the slayings of seven Christians in weekend violence. Rana Sana Ullah, Punjab's provincial law minister, told CNN that the paramilitary Rangers force was helping police and maintaining law and order. Seven people were killed and 20 injured Saturday when Muslim demonstrators set fire to houses in a Christian enclave and fighting broke out, authorities said. Police said the Muslims were protesting an alleged desecration of pages in the Quran, the Muslim sacred text, at a Christian wedding. At a news conference in Islamabad carried on local TV, Shehbaz Bhatti, federal minister for minorities, said an investigation determined there was no desecration of the Quran in village 95 Gill near Gojra City, and the allegations were baseless. He also said the government will rebuild all the burned houses. Bhatti told CNN that four women, two men and a child, all Christians, were either shot to death or killed when their houses were burned. About 50 houses were burned down, and more than 100 were looted by the protesters, Bhatti said. The incident occurred in Gojra City, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) southwest of Lahore. Kamran Michael, Punjab provincial minister for human rights and minority affairs, who is a Christian, told CNN after meeting with Pakistan's Christian leaders in Gojra that a consensus had been reached to observe three days of mourning, from Monday to Wednesday, for the attack on the Christians. On those three days, all schools, colleges, missions and educational institutions run by Christians will remain closed. Christian schools in Karachi, which were due to open for the new term Monday, remained closed. However, schools in most other areas of Pakistan are still on summer vacation. Michael also criticized Pakistan's ""law of offenses relating to religion,"" which has a penalty of life imprisonment for desecration of the Quran and even death for defiling the name of the prophet Mohammed. He called the law unjust and misused, and he strongly condemned it, demanding that it be amended because of its misuse against minorities. Journalist Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","7 killed, 20 hurt Saturday when Muslim protesters set fire to houses in Christian area .

"(CNN) -- The son of an infamous CIA double agent who is himself accused of spying was released from jail Friday in Portland, Oregon, pending trial after a federal judge ruled he did not pose a flight risk. Nathaniel Nicholson, son of an infamous CIA double agent, faces his own spying charges. Judge Anna J. Brown ordered that Nathaniel Nicholson, 24, can be freed provided he stay with family, not leave Oregon without permission from authorities and wear a GPS monitoring device. Brown also ordered that he not have any contact with his father, the admitted spy Harold James ""Jim"" Nicholson. The elder Nicholson pleaded guilty in 1997 to spying for Russia and is the highest ranking CIA officer ever to be sentenced for espionage. While serving a 23-year prison sentence, prosecutors allege, Jim Nicholson, 58, restarted his career as a double agent and enlisted his son Nathaniel in his efforts to collect money owed to him by the Russian spy services and to sell more secrets. Both father and son were charged in January with acting as agents of a foreign government, money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering. They have pleaded not guilty. Court appointed lawyers representing the men did not return CNN's calls for comment . According to the indictment, Nathaniel Nicholson made trips to California, Mexico, Peru and Cyprus, where he met with Russian government representatives who gave him payments totaling over $35,000 in cash. At his father's request, Nathaniel Nicholson allegedly shared the money with his sister and grandparents. Nathaniel Nicholson had complained to his father that he and his sister were short of money to pay for college, prosecutors said. Jim Nicholson told his son that his alleged spying activities ""were 'risky' but not 'illegal,'"" the indictment said. According to court testimony, Nathaniel Nicholson, who is a former U.S. Army paratrooper, initially told authorities that he had traveled overseas to visit ""a battle buddy."" The FBI agents informed Nicholson that lying to them was a federal crime and offered him a ""mulligan,"" or a chance to change his story, according to the agent's testimony. At that point, FBI special agent John Cooney testified, Nicholson became more ""forthcoming"" about his meetings with Russians. If convicted, Jim and Nathaniel Nicholson could face up to 20 years in jail.","Nathaniel Nicholson, son of a CIA double agent, faces spying charges .

"(CNN) -- The AMC series ""Mad Men"" has been honored for its sharp writing, polished acting and engaging portrayal of life at a New York advertising agency in the early 1960s. ""Mad Men"" has gotten attention from fashion designers and clothing merchandisers. It has also been much noticed for something else: its fashion sense. The series, which features all the looks of that era -- thin-lapeled suits and skinny ties, crinoline-puffed dresses and pencil skirts, Peter Pan collars and subdued pinks and greens -- has attracted attention from fashion designers and clothing merchandisers. Banana Republic, which has placed ""Mad Men""-inspired clothes in its window displays, is even offering a walk-on role for the winner of a contest. ""Mad Men,"" which returns for its third season Sunday, isn't the first Hollywood creation to influence fashion trends. For decades, movies and television shows have played a primary role in dictating people's fashion choices, whether they've been aware of it or not. Here are a few examples. 1. In the 1934 film ""It Happened One Night,"" star Clark Gable took off his shirt and showed his bare chest, instead of the standard white undershirt. For decades, an urban legend has maintained that undershirt sales dropped up to 75 percent, not to recover until World War II. Though the mythbusting site Snopes.com says the truth is uncertain, it's testimony to the legend's strength that we're still talking about it 75 years later. 2. The 1967 film ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" with its (somewhat idealized) Depression-era fashion, continues to inspire today's designers. Faye Dunaway's berets, scarves, trench coats, fitted cardigans and long pencil skirts were a hit at the time and remain so today. 3. ""Annie Hall"" boldly showed women that the masculine preppy look was attractive. Star Diane Keaton wore baggy pants, dress shirts, a vest and tie in the 1977 Woody Allen film. The film is said to have influenced a spike in tie sales for women. 4. ""Saturday Night Fever"" rejuvenated a fading disco craze in 1977 and told men it's OK to wear crotch-hugging pants, wide-open, chest-baring shirts and large medallion jewelry. John Travolta's white polyester suit -- later bought by film critic Gene Siskel at auction -- became a disco-era icon. 5. The 1983 film ""Flashdance"" made active wear -- like a ripped sweatshirt off one shoulder, tight leggings and leg warmers -- sexy for women in the early 1980s. Actor Jennifer Beals is said to have cut the collar off a sweatshirt that had shrunk in order to get it over her head, according to the Internet Movie Database. 6. The 1980s TV series ""Miami Vice,"" with its lightweight fabrics and pastel colors, proved a hit on television and in menswear departments. Star Don Johnson's signature look -- T-shirt, suit jacket, linen pants and shoes worn sockless -- could be seen all over the country. (He also popularized the unshaven, stubble-bearded look.) 7. ""Sex and the City"" trendsetter Sarah Jessica Parker, who played Carrie, talked about her shoe addiction constantly during the HBO series, which ran from 1998 to 2004 and spawned a 2008 movie. Soon, stilettos -- paired with a thrown-together look -- became something the cool crowd of viewers would follow, along with brands such as Manolo Blahnik and Jimmy Choo. 8. A game show starting a fashion trend? It happened with ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,"" which featured host Regis Philbin sporting a monochromatic shirt-and-tie look.

"BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- Concerns were growing Wednesday for a polar bear born last month at a German zoo after its twin died and was possibly eaten by its mother. One year ago Vera gave birth to Flocke, pictured here playing in her enclosure in April. The young polar bear died Monday, less than two weeks after it was born, Nuremberg Zoo said. The surviving twin was doing well, the zoo said, but added that it was concerned the mother may not be able to care for it properly. Zookeepers watching a video feed from the bears' enclosure said they had noticed the baby bear looking thinner and weaker. They saw the bears' mother, Vera, nudging the dead bear with her nose and observing it -- and as of Wednesday, they said, the dead bear was nowhere to be seen. ""It is very, very sad,"" said zoo director Dag Encke. ""it is unfortunately frequently the case that with twins, one of the animals doesn't survive."" Zookeepers had kept their distance from Vera and her babies, watching them only on camera so as not to make the mother feel threatened. Polar bears are known to eat their young if they sense any danger or interference. ""We have to worry more about the surviving young animal and take care that the polar bear with her baby is not disturbed,"" Encke said. ""So far, Vera is caring for the surviving baby in an exemplary way."" One year ago Vera gave birth to Flocke, who became an instant celebrity across Germany.

"(CNN) -- An additional 440,000 Honda vehicles are being added to a recall initially announced in November to repair a potential defect in airbag inflation systems, American Honda Motor Co. said Friday. The 2001 Honda Civic is among the vehicles covered by the recall. The recall involves driver-side airbags in certain 2001-02 Honda Accords, 2001 Civics and 2002-03 Acura TLs, the company said in a news release. The affected vehicles will require the replacement of the steering-wheel-mounted airbag inflator. ""In some vehicles, airbag inflators can produce over-pressurization of the driver's [front] airbag inflator mechanism during airbag deployment,"" the release said. ""If an affected inflator deploys, the increased internal pressure may cause the inflator casing to rupture. Metal fragments could pass through the cloth airbag cushion material, possibly causing an injury or fatality to vehicle occupants."" Honda spokesman Chris Noughtan said the potential defect has resulted in six known injuries and one known death. The company will send a recall notice in the mail over the next few months, the release said.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- At least 12 people have died in clashes between Iraqi police and members of an exiled Iranian opposition group at an Iraqi refugee camp, a group spokesman told CNN Friday. Iraqi police block entrances to Camp Ashraf in Diyala province on July 29. A police raid at Camp Ashraf in Diyala province Tuesday led to fighting with members of the group -- the People's Mujahedeen Organization of Iran. Along with the deaths, there have been reports of several hundred injuries. The PMOI was allied with Saddam Hussein in Iraq during the 1980s with a goal of toppling the Iranian regime. But since Hussein's overthrow in 2003, Iraq has established good relations with the Iranian government. Iran wants to see the camp shut down, and the Iraqi government has said it would close the facility after it got control of the camp from the United States this year. Residents in the camp are concerned about being forcibly turned over to Iran. People there said they would be willing to go back to Iran but only if there are assurances its members won't be mistreated. The PMOI official also said 35 people are missing, and there are fears that they were to be forcibly taken back to Iran. The fighting is over now, and Iraqi police have control of the entrances to the camp and its intersections and streets. It also has control of the camp's power station and water purification plant, the PMOI official said. Amnesty International, the human rights monitoring group, wants the Iraqi government ""to investigate the apparent excessive use of force by its security forces."" The group said ""armed security forces used bulldozers to force their way into the camp"" and they ""used tear gas, water cannons and batons against unarmed residents who tried to stop them from entering the camp."" The United States and Iran say the group is a terrorist organization. Amnesty International said in most cases the ""terrorist"" designation pinned on the PMOI by most entities -- such as the European Union and other governments -- has been shelved because the group ""no longer advocates or engages in armed opposition to the government of Iran."" Meanwhile, at least 29 civilians died in Baghdad on Friday when roadside bombs exploded near four Shiite mosques, an Interior Ministry official said. Police believe the attacks were coordinated. The explosions, after Friday prayers had ended, appeared to target worshipers leaving the mosques. The deadliest bombing occurred in the Shaab neighborhood of northern Baghdad, where 21 people were killed and 35 were wounded. Two others exploded in southeastern Baghdad. Two people were killed and seven others were wounded in Jisr Diyala and one person was killed and seven others were wounded in Zafaraniya. Four people were wounded in the eastern neighborhood of Kamaliya neighborhood, and three people were wounded in the southwestern neighborhood of I'lam neighborhood.

"(CNN) -- An infant girl delivered prematurely from her mother, who has the swine flu virus, has died, hospital officials said Monday. Aubrey Opdyke was put into a medically induced coma to give the baby as much oxygen as possible. Parker Christine Opdyke was delivered 14 weeks early by doctors at Wellington Regional Medical Center in Florida's Palm Beach County. Her mother, Aubrey Opdyke, was placed into a medically induced coma June 3 to help give the baby as much oxygen as possible. But doctors delivered Parker on Saturday after her mother suffered a collapsed lung last week. Aubrey Opdyke remains comatose and in critical condition in Wellington's intensive care unit. ""Despite heroic efforts on the part of physicians and nurses, we are sad to announce that baby Parker Christine Opdyke has expired,"" said a written statement from the hospital. No other details were available Monday. Attempts by CNN to reach the family were unsuccessful. Even under the best circumstances, delivering a child at 27 weeks is a very early birth, Dr. David Feld, a Palm Beach County obstetrician and gynecologist, told CNN affiliate WPEC. ""When you have an infectious case, I don't think you're going to see that lung maturity as quickly, and I think that is the issue,"" he said. But, he said, now that Aubrey Opdyke is no longer pregnant, she will be able to fight for her own life. Palm Beach County has had 247 confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus, known as swine flu, but only one death. In late June, a 25-year-old pregnant woman died, but her baby survived. Pregnant women have long been a prime concern of health care officials regarding the flu virus, but are of particular concern during this outbreak of swine flu. Pregnant women have always been advised to get a flu shot because they are at greater risk because of the weakened immune system resulting from their pregnancy. But the H1N1 epidemic has seen new complications and challenges. ""We have seen, with this virus, worse complications and severe infections in pregnant women,"" said Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""We're urging women who are pregnant who develop fever or respiratory symptoms to seek care promptly."" The CDC said it is vitally important for pregnant women to recognize the signs and symptoms, like fever and cough, to get to their doctor quickly and to begin taking antiviral medicines early on. ""I know that many pregnant women don't want to take anything while they're pregnant,"" said Schuchat. ""This is a situation where you need to be more worried about your health and the baby's health.""

"MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota (CNN) -- Abayte Ahmed and her husband learned of their son's death in the most heinous fashion. A family acquaintance called and told them to click on an Internet site. There on the screen were photographs of their 20-year-old son -- the boy with the movie-star looks -- shot through the head thousands of miles away in Somalia. Jamal Bana died in Somalia. Several missing Somali-Americans are believed to have fought there. ""He must have been somewhat disillusioned and indoctrinated, because he didn't have any clue about Somalia at all,"" his mother said, fighting back tears and barely able to speak about her eldest son. Jamal Bana had been missing for months from his Minneapolis home. His family is still grappling with the circumstances surrounding his death in a land they had fled -- an African nation wracked by chaos and violence. The FBI said Bana's death is part of a sweeping federal investigation into a recruiting effort in the United States by a Somali terrorist group called Al-Shabaab, which has ties to al Qaeda. More than a dozen young men of Somali descent have disappeared from the Minneapolis area in recent months. At least three, including Bana, have ended up dead in Somalia, community leaders say.  Watch the harrowing saga of Jamal Bana » . Bana was the kind of son a modest immigrant family pins its hopes on. He was the eldest of seven and studying engineering at local colleges. But last fall, his family said, he disappeared without any warning. A few days later, the phone rang. All that could be heard was a quick sentence. ""I'm in Somalia,"" his mother quoted him as saying. He then hung up. Communication from then on was scarce. In calls or text messages, the family said, Bana was guarded, as though someone was watching or listening to him. On July 11, the family received the call telling them to look on the Internet. Bana's father broke down in tears when he saw the photos. One image was a close-up of his son's face, a bullet wound on one side of his head. Another showed the body being carried through the streets of Mogadishu on a stretcher. His parents said they believe their son was brainwashed and recruited to fight in the civil war between Somalia's unstable transitional government and Al-Shabaab. Al-Shabaab remains entrenched in northeast Somalia and in sections south of Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, after fighting that has uprooted more than 200,000 people since early May, according to the United Nations. The question immigrants in the United States want answered is: How have their youth ended up so far away? One of the missing youth, Shirwa Ahmed, 27, blew up himself and 29 others last fall in Somalia in what is believed to be the first suicide bombing carried out by a naturalized U.S. citizen. Ahmed had traveled from Minneapolis. The attack raised red flags throughout the U.S. intelligence community and sparked an investigation by the FBI. Just weeks ago, community activist Abdirizak Bihi lost his 17-year-old nephew, Burhan Hassan, in Somalia. Asked if his nephew had been kidnapped from Minneapolis, Bihi said, ""They kidnap them in the sense of mental kidnapping, not physically. But they play a male role of mentor."" Bihi and community leader Omar Jamal said they hold one place at least loosely responsible: the Abubakar as-Saddique Islamic Center, the largest mosque in Minneapolis. ""All these kids missing, they all have one thing in common: They all participated in youth programs in that mosque,"" said Jamal. Jamal and Bihi said leaders of the mosque, at the very least, allowed people to come around their facility and recruit young men to fight in Somalia -- a charge the head imam denies. CNN was not allowed inside the mosque, but was granted an interview with the imam at a different location. ""This is the baseless accusation really,"" said Sheikh Abdirahman Sheikh Omar Ahmed. ""The mosque -- the mission of the mosque -- is to worship. And people come to worship and go. We don't have any control over what comes through everybody's mind or ideology."" Sheikh Ahmed said at least two of the young men who died in Somalia did worship at his mosque. But he said no recruiters came around the mosque to pull them away, and said his mosque does not support Al-Shabaab. He added that he has encouraged local families to keep their young sons from going to Somalia. Federal authorities recently made their first arrests in the case, charging two Minnesota men, Salah Osman Ahmed and Abdifatah Yusuf Isse, with one count each of providing material support to terrorists and conspiracy to kill, kidnap, maim or injure people overseas, according to the indictment. CNN could not reach Salah Osman Ahmed's attorney for comment. Published reports indicate he planned to plead not guilty. Isse has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with federal authorities, officials said. In court papers obtained by CNN, Isse's attorney said, ""Mr. Isse will not be the last defendant indicted."" A local attorney involved in the case said at least seven Somali-Americans have been questioned by a grand jury. An FBI official said the bureau cannot rule out the possibility that some of the young men involved could be trained to carry out terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. Meanwhile, CNN has learned more about how Shirwa Ahmed and Burhan Hassan made their way overseas. A travel agent in Minneapolis, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the two men paid about $1,800 in cash for tickets to Nairobi, Kenya, or to Dubai, U.A.E. The travel agent said he thinks the two men then made their way to Mogadishu from those cities on a Somali carrier. For Bana's family, it's all too much to bear. Omar Boley is a close friend who grew up in the same tribe as Bana's family. He said Bana's mother is having difficulty coping with everything that has happened in recent months. ""She doesn't want to hear the story again,"" he said. ""She told me, 'Whenever I see someone talking about my son, I feel bad. I can't sleep. I feel sick. So this happened, nothing I can do. We pray for him.' That's what she said, and that's what I believe.""","Jamal Bana had been missing for months; family learns of his death via Internet .

"(CNN) -- Investigators on Tuesday released the identities of eight people who were killed in a mobile home in southeastern Georgia. Guy Heinze Jr. faces drug charges and is accused of evidence tampering and making false statements. A ninth person remains in critical condition, the Glynn County Police Department said. Police identified the victims as Michelle Toler, 15; Michael Toler, 19; Russell D. Toler Jr., 20; Chrissy Toler, 22; Joseph L. West, 30; Russell D. Toler Sr., 44; Guy Heinze Sr., 45; and Brenda Gail Falagan, 49. They were found dead Saturday in Brunswick, Georgia, about 300 miles southeast of Atlanta, on the Atlantic coast. Police said autopsies were completed Monday, but they did not offer any information about the findings. Authorities did not identify the hospitalized victim. A man who found the bodies called 911 Saturday to report in an anguished voice that he had arrived home to find ""my whole family's dead.""  Hear the frantic 911 call reporting the slayings » . ""I just got home,"" a man identified as Guy Heinze Jr., 22, tells the emergency dispatcher in the call, released Monday. ""I was out last night. I got home just now, and everybody's dead. ... My whole family's dead. It looks like they've been beaten to death. ""I don't know what to do, man,"" an emotional Heinze tells the dispatcher. ""My dad, my mom, my uncle, my cousin. .... My dad, he's laying there dead. That was my dad."" A neighbor placed the call and put Heinze on the phone as well as the mobile home park's maintenance man. The park manager also called 911, sobbing as she told dispatchers, ""Please hurry."" Officers found seven people dead in the residence at the New Hope mobile home park. An eighth person died Sunday. Heinze was arrested Saturday night and faces charges of having a controlled substance and marijuana as well as evidence tampering and making false statements to a police officer, Glynn County Police Chief Matt Doering said. According to an arrest warrant, Heinz provided ""investigators with false and misleading information about his whereabouts and involvement in the circumstances leading up to him calling 911 to report the deaths of his family members."" No further details were available. The arrest warrant also said that he removed a shotgun from the residence and hid it in the trunk of his car. He had Darvocet, a narcotic painkiller, and marijuana in a pill bottle in the center console of his car, according to the arrest warrant. Doering said Heinze has been cooperative. He stopped short of naming him a suspect in the deaths. ""We're still looking for anybody and everybody that may be related to this,"" he said Sunday. ""That naturally includes [Heinze]. Of course, we're looking at him."" Heinze's attorney, Ron Harrison, said his client, who has a bail hearing Wednesday, denies any involvement in the killings. The arrest warrant, he said, alleges that his client took a shotgun from the house and hid it in his car. Asked how Heinze was doing, Harrison said, ""Not well. Not well at all. You come across this murder scene, you call 911, and then you end up in jail."" Police have said they have ""no known suspects"" in the case. ""We are not looking for any known suspects,"" Doering said. ""That doesn't say that there are no suspects. They're just not known to us."" The 911 call paints a picture of violent chaos. At one point, while the maintenance man, known only as Mike, talks to dispatchers, Heinze goes in the mobile home and reports that his cousin, identified as Michael, is breathing. The maintenance man said that Michael is a ""young man with Down syndrome."" Heinze reports the youth's ""face is smashed in,"" he said. Heinze gets back on the phone to talk to a supervisor, repeating that Michael appears to be having trouble breathing and needs an ambulance. The dispatcher assures him help is on the way and tries to question him gently. ""People's beat,"" Heinze said. ""Everybody is dead."" Asked what the mobile home looks like, he yells, ""It looks like a [expletive] murder scene."" The dispatcher asks Heinze to try to question Michael, and Heinze asks him, ""Where do you hurt?"" There is no response. Doering said Sunday that police think at least one person not in custody may have information in the case. Police had been called to the home before, Doering said, but would not say why. He has been tight-lipped about many aspects of the case, refusing to say how the victims died. All nine victims lived in the mobile home, he said, and police do not believe any of them conducted the assault. He said police are making progress and have narrowed down the timeline for when the deaths occurred.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The renewable energy sector has received a boost with the inauguration of the world's first commercial wave power project off the Portuguese coast. It is hoped that the Pelamis Wave Energy Converters will provide energy for 15,000 homes. Developed by a Scottish engineering company, Pelamis Wave Power Limited, the Pelamis Wave Energy Converters (PWEC) have been towed into position three miles off the coast of Agucadoura in north Portugal. The first phase of the project is using three PWEC to generate 2.25 megawatts of power at a cost of nine million euros. If successful, a second phase will see energy generation rise to 21 megawatts from a further 25 machines providing electricity for 15,000 Portuguese homes. The project is a joint venture between Pelamis Wave Power Limited, Babcock and Brown Ltd -- a global specialist asset manager, Energias de Portugal (EDP) and Portuguese energy group EFACEC. Named after the sea snake Pelamis, each machine measures 140 meters in length, is 3.5 meters wide and sits partially submerged in the sea. Babcock and Brown's Anthony Kennaway explained to CNN how the PWEC work. ""Effectively what you have is four long sections making up one machine. Between those sections are three small generating motors,"" he said. ""The four sections are all joined by hydraulic rams. As the waves run through the machine it pushes the rams in and out. The action of the rams going to and fro pushes hydraulic fluid into a high-pressure reservoir. That high-pressure reservoir then releases the fluid at a steady rate through a generating motor."" This power is fed down to a cable on the sea bed which then links back to a sub-station on shore where it is converted into useable electricity. The PWEC are, of course, reliant on the weather. Depending on the wave resource, Pelamis predict that the machines will on average produce 25-40 percent of their full power output over the course of a year. When the full array of 25 machines are in place it is calculated that around 60,000 tons of CO2 will be displaced. If wave power was fully exploited, the British Wind Energy Association estimates that one-two billion tons of CO2 could be displaced every year. Ian Fells, emeritus professor of energy conversion at Newcastle University in England, gave this latest development in wave power a cautious welcome. ""It's extraordinarily difficult to design a machine that will cope with the extreme violence of waves. Some wave machines are under the surface all the time -- but they are not as well developed as yet. Pelamis lies in the surface and it remains to be seen how successful it will be,"" he told CNN. ""But good luck to them. We'll just have to see how it operates over time and how it copes with serious weather conditions."" Professor Fells, a founding chairman of the New and Renewable Energy Center (NaREC) at Blyth, Northumberland, is convinced of the potential of wave power engineering but says it is still in its infancy. ""A few years ago when I was talking about a 500-kilowatt Wavegen machine, I was asked by a reporter how many of these we would need to replace the two nuclear power stations in Scotland, and the answer is 10,000. That puts things into perspective.""","World's first commercial wave power project is inaugurated off the Portuguese coast .

"(REAL SIMPLE) -- If you were to ask my friends back in high school, they would probably say I was one of the lucky ones. I had a face most people at least considered attractive, maybe even beautiful. And for much of my life I had an hourglass figure. Asha Bandele wrote ""Something Like Beautiful: One Single Mother's Story,"" 'The Prisoner's Wife"" and ""Daughter."" But as 40 approached and my figure, um, filled out, I would look in the mirror and no longer see myself as sexy. Then one night that changed. I was at a meeting in a small town with a group of young women who were reading from my most recent book, a memoir that discussed my history of depression and surviving abuse. After the gathering ended, one of the women approached me. She told me that while she was growing up, she had been told to shut up so often she just did it automatically. It felt good to hear someone give voice to how she felt inside, she said. We talked about all the things that kept us silent and shut down. She promised to speak out more from that day on. As she walked away, something came over me: I felt ignited, energized...yes, beautiful. Real Simple: 34 low-cost, make-you-smile ideas . And the more I thought about that woman and our conversation, the more I realized that it wasn't just those instances of bonding or appreciation at public readings that triggered my inner glow; it was my own solitary engagement with language. What makes you feel beautiful? Writing requires us to take the world on more slowly, to notice its harshness as well as its richness. Writing reduces the chaos in my mind. As the gospel song says, it orders my steps and makes me feel in control of myself and therefore appreciative of the world. Real Simple: Keep your mind and body in top condition . Women don't get enough credit for the amount of self we invest in our work. In the last year, watching some of the most talented women I know being laid off has been tough. Knowing that the work they loved -- whether in finance, real estate, or writing -- may be gone forever has been downright devastating, and their grief over this loss is boundless. ""I feel like nothing, like I just want to disappear,"" said one brilliant friend. ""Losing my job is like the worst breakup I've ever been through,"" said another. In the midst of this carnage, I've clung ever tighter to my work -- not so much to the money-making part of it, which ebbs and flows (mostly ebbs, lately), but to the basic joy I've always taken in words; that at least doesn't go anywhere. Real Simple: How to worry less . For so long I had measured my beauty (and, really, my worth) by my dress size. And, hey, I would love, I mean love, to be a size 6 again. Still, every time I give a lecture or teach a workshop and touch someone -- or write a page and reach a deeper part of myself -- I feel so useful and relevant. It translates to a more profound feeling of beauty than the rush I once got from someone admiring my breast size. I like superficial praise as much as the next person, but at 40 the love finally had to go deeper, didn't it? Get a FREE TRIAL issue of Real Simple - CLICK HERE! Copyright © 2009 Time Inc.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A 16 year-old Australian schoolgirl is hoping to achieve a sailing feat that is so tough it has brought many experienced men and women to the brink of death. Sixteen-year-old Jessica Watson of Australia plans to sail solo around the world . Jessica Watson, of Mooloolaba, Queensland, plans to set out on a solo round-the-world sailing mission in November -- and hopes to become the youngest person to ever sail non-stop around the world alone. But with the impending weeks of solitary confinement, freeze-dried foods, changing conditions and threat of injury, illness or death -- why would she want to do it? Watson told CNN her inspiration had come from fellow Australian Kay Cottee, who became the first woman to sail the globe alone, without stopping; and German-born Australian Jesse Martin, who still holds the record as the youngest person to do it. Martin achieved his feat in 1999 aged 18 (at the finish), and subsequently wrote a book titled ""Lionheart: A Journey of the Human Spirit."" ""I read Jesse's book and that was inspiring. If you had to put it down to one thing that encouraged me to do this that would be a good one,"" Watson said. Since deciding she wanted to take on what she describes as the ""Everest of the ocean"" about four years ago, Watson has been doing all she can to gain the best preparation for the adventure. She has already sailed ""mock solo"" across the Tasman Sea, which flows between Australia and New Zealand, at 15 and has been sailing since she was 8 years-old. ""I've been talking to people [who have done it] about it all, and I'll get in some good solo miles before I go,"" she said. Despite the experience she has gained, Watson admits there are some aspects of the journey that remain unknown. ""There are definitely things I'm nervous about -- like the big waves and gear failure. But, it's amazing the detail of preparation we can get and what you can do with technology. ""Though, there's no telling how you'll handle yourself when you're out there for eight months until you're actually out there."" Watson's journey around the globe is part of what seems to be an increasingly popular trend among young sailors. Seventeen year-old Briton, Mike Perham is currently part-way through his attempt to sail the world solo for charity. Perham is at present stuck in Tasmania, Australia, with gear problems and faces the daunting task of sailing around Cape Horn during the winter season. Still, he has come a long way when many people had raised concerns about the voyage before he departed. On his daily blog, Perham writes about the challenges of being at sea alone, ""The first few days at sea are always the worst -- the lack of sleep leaves me feeling drained all the time but I know I just need to keep pushing on, knowing that I'll soon acclimatize and that things are going to get better and better."" Another teenager -- 16 year-old Zac Sunderland, who is from California -- is also on a mission to become the youngest sailor to achieve the feat. Sunderland has also progressed from his departure point in California, through the Panama Canal, and into the Atlantic Ocean. For Perham, Sunderland and Watson it was the high level of communications technology at the teenagers disposal as they sail that has convinced their parents to allow them to attempt their journeys. Would you allow your teenage daughter or son to sail solo around the world? Tell us below in the SoundOff box . On Sunderland's Web site his father, Laurence, said, ""Although Zac is alone as he sails, he really has so much help. There will always be people who will disagree with our decision to let Zac go on this trip. It was his idea and it is his desire to continue."" Watson said her parents had also been supportive from the outset. For the young sailor, the next big challenge is preparing the boat for departure and securing a final sponsor to help fund the journey. She said her life is primarily geared towards the challenge this year. ""It might take a little bit longer to finish school ... this puts everything else on hold.""","Sixteen-year-old Jessica Watson plans to sail solo around the world .

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexico has fired more than 700 customs agents and replaced them with better-trained and educated workers who officials hope will be less likely to give in to the temptation of bribery and other crimes. Cars cross the border into Mexico at the customs post in Tijuana on Monday. The new agents were trained by the army to detect the smuggling of weapons, drugs, pirated products and other items, which has increased in recent years due to corruption. But Mexican Department of Customs officials were quick to point out that the military is not taking over at the nation's 49 customs posts. ""They are not military,"" said Customs Chief Juan Jose Bravo. ""They are practically professional, most of them in outside commerce, in similar careers, who are qualified to work in customs matters."" All the new agents underwent psychological exams, drug screenings and background checks, Mexican officials said. The new recruits are between the ages of 18 and 30; 65 percent are men and 35 percent are women. Authorities also want to improve the Customs Department's image. The department is part of the Federal Mexican Government Ministry of Commerce and Industrial Development. ""Of course, the outside perception held by many about officials, and particularly this group, was of high corruption,"" Bravo said. ""We did this, fundamentally, because we wanted to professionalize new training with a new plan."" But some security experts believe that replacing the customs agents will not resolve the problem of corruption. ""It's been perfectly demonstrated that that changing people can be absolutely futile if the structures keep functioning the same way,"" said Ernesto Lopez Portillo, executive director of the Institute for Security and Democracy. ""Because the structures, the protocols, the systems are what allow people to comply with regulations.""","More than 700 customs agents replaced with better-trained workers .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A 23-year-old British student has designed a ""super-green superyacht"" built using only sustainable materials and which produces virtually no carbon emissions. 600 square meters of solar panels and three giant ""wings"" mean  ""Soliloquy"" can run on wind energy or solar power. ""Soliloquy's"" unique eco-luxury design allows the boat to run on two different sources of sustainable energy by incorporating 600 square meters of solar panels on the exterior of the boat and giant rigid ""wings"" that function like sails. Although the 58-meter boat has yet to be built, it would be able to run either on wind energy via the wings (known as ""rigid-wing solarsails""), solar power supplied by the panels or a combination of the two. An equivalent-sized superyacht burns anywhere between 250 and 600 liters of marine diesel per hour, depending on speed and fuel efficiency, and emits three times that in CO2 emissions, according to British yachting carbon offset company, Yacht Carbon Offset. Some of the biggest SUVs on the road burn around 20 liters of fuel per hour. Both the panels and solarsails -- developed by Australian company Solar Sailor -- on the vessel can fold up or completely stretch out depending on which energy source is in use, changing the yacht's shape. ""I wanted to prove that eco-luxury no longer has to be an oxymoron and doesn't have to make a yacht more expensive,"" designer Alastair Callender, a life-long sailing fanatic, told CNN.   See more images of super-yacht Soliloquy » . ""My generation is passionate about the planet and we've got to do all we can so that the earth can sustain us,"" he added. ""At the same time, however, I am also passionate about superyachts."" Soliloquy is projected to cost approximately $60 to $65 million to build -- similar in cost to conventional superyachts of its size. Callender is currently in talks with potential owners to have the vessel built. The wider superyacht community is enthused about the potential of his design and he has also been invited to speak about his ever-evolving, eco-vessel in Abu Dhabi and Monaco. Callender was originally inspired by famed architect David Fishers' design for a ""constantly moving"" tower in Dubai. ""That's how the idea of an ever-evolving superyacht started -- with the three wings that can independently rotate through 360 degrees,"" Callender explained. Do you like the look of Soliloquy? Tell us in the Sound Off box below . Callender designed ""Soliloquy"" during his final year studying at Coventry University in England. He approached Solar Sailor, an Australian technology company for technical validation of his design. He also asked a local engineering company, Visioneering, to help construct an intricately detailed scale model. At first, some at Visioneering were taken aback by Callender's young age. ""But the idea was innovative and sometimes younger people can bring on board really fresh, new ideas,"" said Adrian Coppin of Visioneering. ""He also has a lot of experience in the yachting industry."" Callender says his passion comes from a childhood spent in Portsmouth, England: ""I grew up near a harbor, 200 meters away from my sailing club."" After school, Callender went to Greece for six months to teach sailing. He then worked with some of the big yacht design companies, including that of his mentor, Andrew Winch. He now feels confident that with a good business plan, his project will become reality. ""There are hundreds of extremely rich families who invest in green technology and until now have not wanted to buy yachts because they produce too many carbon emissions,"" he said. ""But with a yacht like Soliloquy, I think they may consider it.""","A 23-year-old British student has designed a super-green superyacht .

"(CNN) -- Hong Kong is well suited to providing a quick hit of urban thrills and retail therapy, but time-pressed visitors can also get a glimpse of another side of the city away from the shopping malls and neon-lit streets. It's not hard to find things to do or places to go at any time of day or night. A trip to The Peak is a good point from which to begin the day. Home to some of Hong Kong's most expensive properties, it's also the place for an unbeatable view, smog and weather permitting. Catch a tram there from next to the tranquil Hong Kong Park -- where early risers practice their tai chi -- or take a cheap taxi ride, which can whisk you there in a few minutes. A clear morning will reveal the city's high-rise buildings and skyscrapers unfurled below, with Kowloon and the green and mountainous New Territories in the middle distance. The pay-to-enter Peak Tower will also give you a view of the southern side of Hong Kong Island and the South China Sea, although a short walk round Lugard Road is a more rewarding way to take in the city below and work up an appetite. Hong Kong is a restaurant city and dim sum, which refers to a variety of light dishes like dumplings, is a city staple that can be enjoyed at any time in this 24-hour city. It's most commonly taken as a mid-morning meal. Image gallery: Hong Kong highlights » . Head back down towards Hong Kong's Central district, center of the city's finance and banking industry that funded the striking skyscrapers. The Luk Yu Tea House on Stanley Street is an oak-paneled gem that retains its charm despite its popularity: it's a fine spot for tea and dim sum. For even more local flavor, pull up a plastic stool at a ""dai pai dong,"" or street restaurant, situated further along Stanley Street, for cheap, quick, tasty eats. If you're in the city on Sunday, Maxim's in Wan Chai is one of the few places where dim sum is still served by aging trolley dollies. Flag them down as they trundle past; point, eat and enjoy. You can't book a table but it's worth a visit for the atmosphere and harbor backdrop as much as the food. Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated places on the planet, but its bustling streets are easy to navigate, helped by the affordable and plentiful taxis and an efficient public transport system. The city's skinny trams are a throwback to a different era and worth jumping on for a short journey just to watch the city go by: consider it a good chance to digest lunch. While the city is generally unsentimental when it comes to preserving its old architecture, Sheung Wan, well within walking distance from Central, can give you a better feel of the city away from the shiny malls and new office buildings. From Queens Road, jump on the escalator (yes, escalator) all the way up to Caine Road and wind your way back down the hill. The Dr Sun Yat Sen Museum and some incense-burning temples are nestled among the evocative streets, where you'll also find galleries and independent shops. The area is subject to increasing gentrification, so stroll down Gage Street while you still can: its market will soon disappear as part of the area's redevelopment. Head towards the piers to catch the Star Ferry to Kowloon. Take one of the vintage green tugs -- as iconic as the city's skyscrapers -- from Central Pier to Tsim Sa Tsui (commonly referred to as TST) on the other side of the harbor. As shopping is more of a way of life than a pastime for many Hong Kongers, you'll find you're never far from luxury brand outlets. TST offers just as many consumer delights as anywhere in the city. Away from the air-conditioned glitz of TST's Harbour City shopping plaza, or the boutiques around Granville Terrace, the streets to the north of Yau Ma Tei have a more visceral feel where shopping is no less popular and goes on until late at night, especially at the bargain-paradise for watches and bags, the ""ladies night market"" on Tung Choi Street. Even if shopping isn't on the agenda it's a great place for people watching and getting a sense of the energy of the city. From the throng to a bit of flash: early evening cocktails at Felix or Aqua bar should revive any weary spirits. The swank factor here is high, but there are killer views. They are also great vantage points for the lights and laser show that illuminates the skyscrapers on Hong Kong Island every night at 8pm. On the island side, Sevva's balcony is next to the HSBC building, where you can feel closer to the lights and laser action while enjoying some well-mixed cocktails. Horse racing, like shopping, is another Hong Kong passion and if you're in town on a Wednesday race night, losing a few dollars at Happy Valley racetrack is great entertainment, as well as a glimpse into the expat social scene. Finding a place to eat dinner is never a problem, but for a night on the town head to Central's Soho (here it means South of Hollywood Road). Lan Kwai Fong is the main honey-pot for the bar crowd, but there's better to be had around Peel Street, Staunton Street and -- for extra posing potential -- Wyndham Terrace, where the bars and restaurants stay open late, late enough at least until the clubs open their doors.

"CABANATUAN CITY, Philippines (CNN) -- Typhoon Parma crossed the northern tip of the already storm-battered Philippines over the weekend, triggering landslides that killed at least 12 people, local media reported Sunday. Residents paddle boats through the streets of Santa Cruz, south of Manila. At least three other deaths related to the storms were confirmed earlier. Among the latest victims were children ages 8 and 10, a local reporter who was at the scene of both landslides told CNN. The storm is expected to stall for at least three days north of Luzon -- the largest of the Philippine islands -- dumping more rain on the island nation still reeling from a typhoon last week, said CNN meteorologist Ivan Cabrera. Heavy rains will remain, but wind will not be much of a factor, Cabrera said. At 11 p.m. ET on Saturday, Parma had maximum sustained winds of 120 kph ( 74 mph), Cabrera said. Aid agencies were in the area assisting survivors. ""There are many uprooted trees, as well as down power lines, making roads impassable in some areas,"" said Wilma Lacaden, a member of the World Vision organization, in a statement. ""Homes constructed of light materials were blown away. In many areas, there is no electricity, and rivers have overflowed, making some towns and villages inaccessible."" World Vision staffers handed out food and candles to 200 families on Saturday night, and plan to assist another 350 families in nearby Zambales on Sunday, distributing relief packs of food and water, the statement said. Parma, known locally as Typhoon Pepeng, made landfall Saturday afternoon in a rural region of fishermen and farmers in Luzon. Tens of thousands of people fled their homes for safer shelter. Winds whipped the coastline and felled power lines in northernmost Cagayan Province. Debris littered the roads, making evacuations more difficult. Read about the fate of a farming community in Cagayan . Parma avoided a direct hit on heavily populated Manila. In the capital city on Sunday, it was sunny, Manila resident Arturo Fidelino said in an e-mail to CNN, adding the last few days have been ""grueling"" for Filipinos. ""After those two horrendous typhoons ... we've got to start picking up the pieces and move on,"" he said. ""Easy for me to say and for those who were not worst hit by the devastation, but too difficult for those whose houses were wiped out, furniture destroyed and relatives and loved ones nowhere to be found."" However, he said people have banded together to help one another, and it ""has made me realize that the 'bayanihan spirit' (part of Filipino culture where neighbors help each other) among Filipinos is still alive and kicking. All along I thought that it has just been part of our history and not part of this present times. I was mistaken."" Fidelino wrote his 73-year-old mother had to be evacuated when her home flooded. The typhoon is expected to dump as much as 8 to 20 inches of rain in areas still water-logged from last week's Typhoon Ketsana. That storm resulted in the heaviest rainfall in 40 years and at one point, 80 percent of Manila was submerged. Ketsana, which swallowed whole houses and buses, killed 246 in the Philippines. An additional 38 are missing, the National Disaster Coordinating Council said. The storm affected nearly 2 million people.

"(CNN) -- More than 1 million babies born prematurely die each year before they are a month old, the March of Dimes said Sunday in the first comprehensive global report on premature births. A premature baby rests at a hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan, in October 2007. The organization suggested the situation could worsen if the rate of premature births increases. Each year, 12.9 million infants -- or nearly 10 percent of the annual worldwide birth total -- are born before 37 weeks of development in the womb, the organization said. More than 85 percent of the premature births occur in developing countries in Africa and Asia. ""Premature births are an enormous global problem that is exacting a huge toll emotionally, physically and financially on families, medical systems and economies,"" March of Dimes President Jennifer Howse said in a statement. ""In the United States alone, the annual cost of caring for preterm babies and their associated health problems tops $26 billion."" The March of Dimes report, which used data collected by the World Health Organization, breaks down premature birth rates by continent. The highest premature birth rate is in Africa, where 11.9 percent of births each year are preterm, with more than 4 million premature deliveries annually. In populous Asia, although the preterm birth rate is lower at 9.1 percent, the number of premature births is higher, at nearly 7 million a year. While North America -- consisting of the United States and Canada in this report -- counts fewer than 500,000 premature births a year, its preterm birth rate is close to that of Africa, at 10.6 percent of all births, according to the report. The rate is the world's second highest. In the United States, the rate of preterm births has increased 36 percent in the past 25 years, with births between the 34th and 36th week of gestation accounting for the majority of the increase, the organization found. Much of the hike in preterm births is linked to more pregnancies after the age of 35 and the use of fertility treatments that can lead to multiple births. ""Wherever trend data are available, rates of preterm birth are increasing,"" the report said. Infants who survive premature birth face lifelong health risks, including the possible development of cerebral palsy, blindness, hearing loss, learning disabilities and other chronic conditions, according to the March of Dimes. ""Preterm birth is a global problem that needs greater attention by policymakers, researchers, health care providers, the media, donor organizations and other stakeholders,"" the report said. ""The marked disparities in preterm birth along racial/ethnic lines in many high-income countries and the concentration of preterm births in Africa and Asia also clearly indicate that addressing preterm birth is essential for reducing the pronounced inequities in neonatal health and for the world to achieve,"" it added. The March of Dimes, a nonprofit agency engaged in pregnancy and baby health research, said some premature births can be prevented by addressing risk factors in mothers, including diabetes, high blood pressure, nutrition, body weight and tobacco and alcohol use. Women who earlier gave birth to a preemie face a greater risk of having another. While doctors know some of the health and behavior factors in mothers that increase the risk of preterm births, doctors have yet to identify a reliable remedy to prevent early labor, said Christopher Howson, vice president for global programs of the March of Dimes. ""While much can be done right now to reduce death and disability from preterm birth even in low-resource settings, we need to know more about the underlying causes of premature birth in order to develop effective prevention strategies,"" Howson said.","March of Dimes: Nearly 10 percent of world's births are premature .

"(CNN) -- When iReporter Carlos Ortega evacuated Galveston's West End  last week, there was a road, a row of houses and about 150 feet of sand between his house and the water. Now the surf laps about 30 feet from his door. iReporter Carlos Ortega says there's ""not an inch that isn't damaged"" in his Galveston, Texas, neighborhood. Hurricane Ike devastated the Texas city over the weekend, and Gov. Rick Perry said it could be weeks before residents could return. ""There's substantial structural damage, obviously ... (no) electrical power,"" he said. ""It's going to be a while."" Ortega, a professor at the University of Houston, and his partner walked about six miles down the beach on Sunday and said there's ""not an inch that isn't damaged."" iReport.com: See Ortega's home before and after Ike . He said one beachfront house was knocked off its stilts and was lying on the ground like an amusement park funhouse. A dead cow washed in front of another home. ""It was pretty depressing and devastating to see how everything was just torn up,"" he said. ""People's lives and houses were just torn up."" All but two of the houses on the ""front row,"" nearest the beach, in their Bermuda Beach subdivision were destroyed, he said. ""You wouldn't know there was a house there."" ""The house across the street from us is completely gone, and there's no trace of it,"" he said. The first floor of their house is covered with 3 to 4 feet of sand and debris, including huge chunks of asphalt from the road that ran in front of the house. ""We don't keep anything of value down there,"" he said, because people expect to get high water occasionally. There were some windows out on the second level, but they did not have much water damage. Ortega said the storm washed a Jet Ski out of the garage and dumped it about five blocks away. iReport.com: Have you been home after Ike? Share your story . It still worked, Ortega said, but was stuck in the sand. Ortega rode out the storm at his house in Houston, which also suffered some damage. ""The expectation was that it was going to be like three years ago when the last storm (Rita) came through, and it was so much worse,"" he said. iReporter Matteu Erchull stayed on Galveston Island during the storm. ""I think everybody downplayed the severity of the storm, including myself,"" he said, adding that he didn't regret staying. iReport.com: Ike passes over Galveston iReporter . After the storm, he put on his fishing waders and helped rescue some of his neighbors. ""Some people literally hid in their attics.

Nearly 2,000 people who did not evacuate have been rescued along the southeastern Texas coast, said Steve McCraw, director of the Texas Office of Homeland Security. On Sunday, a Galveston County sheriff's official said three bodies were pulled from storm wreckage in Port Bolivar, bringing to 10 the number of reported deaths in Texas linked to Ike. Erchull said he got through the storm OK, but most of his stuff was ruined. ""I lost everything. Water rose up to about 10 feet. Got into everything and flooded everything I had,"" he said. He said he tried to wash his clothes, but he just couldn't get the smell out. ""The smell was just this really musky moldy wet smell, it's really hard to explain. Imagine leaving your clothes accidentally in the washer for 10 days, it's just disgusting,"" he said. Erchull said there's no power on the island, and the National Guard was going door-to-door asking people to leave.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The nude body of a former swimsuit model found last weekend in Orange County was identified through her breast implants' serial number, two law enforcement sources said Friday. An arrest warrant has been issued for Ryan Alexander Jenkins, wanted in the death of Jasmine Fiore. An arrest warrant alleging murder was issued Thursday for Ryan Alexander Jenkins, a reality TV contestant whom Jasmine Fiore, 28, married in March. CNN has not confirmed reports that the marriage was annulled. Fiore's body was found Saturday in a Dumpster behind an apartment complex in Buena Park, just outside Anaheim, California. Her teeth had been extracted and fingers removed in what police said was an apparent attempt to conceal her identity. Fiore lived in Los Angeles and was last seen alive Friday in San Diego at a poker game with Jenkins, a reality TV contestant. ""We believe he has crossed into Canada,"" U.S. Marshals Chief Inspector Thomas Hession told reporters. Prosecutors requested bail be set at $10 million.  Reality contestant charged » . Jenkins is believed to be armed, Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said Thursday. ""There's a handgun missing from his apartment, which is the last place he was before he fled,"" he said. Jenkins matched the description of a man seen driving a boat Wednesday in Blaine Marina off northwest Washington, the Whatcom County Sheriff's Office said. Blaine, Washington, borders Canada. Authorities searched the area and found Jenkins' black SUV with an empty boat trailer at the Blaine Marina, police said. Jenkins reported Fiore missing Saturday night to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, authorities said. The body was identified Monday as Fiore. While the cause of death had not been confirmed, a preliminary coroner's report indicated she was strangled. According to court records in Las Vegas, Nevada, Jenkins was charged in June with battery for allegedly striking Fiore in the arm with his fist. In 2007, Jenkins pleaded guilty in Calgary, Alberta, to assault in a separate case. He was sentenced to 15 months probation, ordered to undergo counseling for domestic violence and sex addiction and to stay away from the person involved, according to court records. Jenkins, who appeared on the VH1 show ""Megan Wants a Millionaire,"" is from Calgary. 51Minds, which produced ""Megan Wants a Millionaire,"" said Thursday in a written statement that it ""was not aware of Ryan Jenkins' record when it cast him."" ""The company did have in place what it thought was a thorough vetting process that involved complete background checks by an outside company for all contestants on its shows,"" it said. ""Clearly, the process did not work properly in this case. 51 Minds is investigating what went wrong and taking steps to ensure that this sort of lapse never occurs again.""

"CABO SAN LUCAS, Mexico (CNN) -- A ""dangerous"" Hurricane Jimena bore down Tuesday on the Mexican peninsula of Baja California, with the resort town of Cabo San Lucas lying in its path. Meanwhile, a new tropical storm was forming in the Atlantic Ocean. A NOAA satellite image shows Hurricane Jimena off the coast of Baja California, Mexico, on Tuesday morning. Jimena's maximum wind speed dropped from 145 mph to 135 mph, but it still remained a Category 4 storm, according to the U.S. National Weather Service's 11 a.m. PT (2 p.m. ET) update. ""Some fluctuations in strength are likely today and gradual weakening is forecast on Wednesday,"" the weather service said. ""However, Jimena is expected to remain a major hurricane until landfall."" Also on Tuesday, Tropical Storm Erika formed in the Atlantic, 390 miles east of the Leeward Islands, the National Hurricane Center said. Jimena's storm center is forecast to come ashore on Thursday morning, but the weather service warned that ""because it will be moving parallel to the coastline, any slight change in direction could have a huge impact in the location and timing of landfall."" Mexico's government extended a hurricane warning for most of the southern half of Baja California -- from Punta Abreojos on the peninsula's west coast to Mulege on its east coast, according to the National Weather Service. A hurricane warning means hurricane conditions are expected within the warning area in the next 24 hours and people should quickly prepare ""to protect life and property."" ""A dangerous storm surge along with battering waves will produce significant coastal flooding along the Baja California Peninsula,"" NWS said in its 11 a.m. PT report . On its current track, Jimena's center will approach the peninsula's southern portion later on Tuesday and central Baja California peninsula by Thursday, the weather service said at 11 a.m. PT. In addition to damaging winds, the storm could bring as much as 15 inches of rain, forecasters said. Jimena -- the 10th named storm of the Pacific season -- was centered about 110 miles (175 km) south-southwest of Cabo San Lucas, according to the weather service. It was traveling north-northwest near 12 mph (19 kph). People in his town of Los Cabos, at the very tip of the peninsula, were preparing for the storm and were getting a precursor as winds and rains began to pick up, said resident Cuauhtemoc Morgan on Monday. Morgan, who sent videos to to CNN's iReport, said residents had protected every home in his neighborhood, fortifying windows with masking tape. Lines at supermarkets were long with worried residents preparing for the storms, Morgan said. Authorities were setting up shelters in schools and trying to devise a plan to protect the homeless, he added.","NEW: Tropical Storm Erika forms in eastern Atlantic, National Hurricane Center says .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- The world will soon see an ""explosion"" of swine flu cases as the H1N1 virus spreads rapidly around the world, a top World Health Organization official said Friday. Spread of the H1N1 virus is entering an ""acceleration period,"" WHO official says. Spread of the virus is entering an ""acceleration period"" and it is certain that there will be more cases and more deaths, said Dr. Shin Young-soo, the organization's regional director for the Western Pacific. ""Most countries may see a doubling of cases every three to four days for two months until peak transmission is reached,"" he said at a symposium in Beijing, China. ""At a certain point, there will seem to be an explosion in case numbers. I believe it is very likely that all countries will see community-level transmission by the end of the year."" More than 1,490 people around the world have died from the virus since it emerged this spring, Shin said. Swine flu is the first influenza pandemic in more than 40 years. So far, it has caused mostly mild illness, but Shin warned ""the virus has a sting in its tail"" because it is very infectious and ""has the potential to cause more serious disease."" Any widespread resistance to antiviral drugs, expected to be available this fall, could make the situation worse, he said. The virus so far has shown itself to be unpredictable, Shin said, so the public needs to be prepared. He called for accurate and timely public health messages and early treatment of severe cases. The public needs to comply with these health messages, and everyone needs to be able to recognize symptoms early and get timely medical care, he said. ""We will only be safe when we have applied these lessons in every country dealing with this virus,"" Shin said. ""We need to learn quickly since, as I believe, it appears that this pandemic will get worse before the situation gets better.""","Spread of the virus is entering an ""acceleration period,"" official says .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Honey has been used to treat wounds since ancient times, but recent years have seen a surge of medical interest in the sticky stuff. Research has shown that honey has antibacterial properties. Manuka honey has been the subject of particular interest, with the results of a study just published by Sydney University finding that it has powerful antibacterial properties, and is even effective against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Associate Professor Dee Carter, from Sydney University's School of Molecular and Microbial Biosciences said: ""Our research is the first to clearly show that these honey-based products could in many cases replace antibiotic creams on wounds and equipment such as catheters. Using honey as an intermediate treatment could also prolong the life of antibiotics."" ""Most bacteria that cause infections in hospitals are resistant to at least one antibiotic, and there is an urgent need for new ways to treat and control surface infections."" She added: ""We don't quite know how these honeys prevent and kill infections, but a compound in them called methylglyoxal seems to interact with a number of other unknown compounds in honey to prevent infectious bacteria developing new strains that are resistant to it."" Honey is a complex substance, containing up to 800 compounds and its complexity means it has been difficult to pinpoint exactly how it kills bacteria. Manuka is a type of honey that is made by bees pollinating the flowers of the Manuka bush, a member of the Leptospermum family that grows naturally in New Zealand. Now, an Australian company is claiming to have produced the world's most potent medical-grade antibacterial honey, made by bees pollinating the Australian jellybush, also a member of the Leptospermum family. Australia's Medi Bioactive Honey Company claims its Berringa antibacterial honey has twice the antibacterial content of normal manuka honey, and has launched the product in the UK. Dr Rose Cooper of the University of Wales Cardiff School of Health Sciences has researched honey's antibacterial action and has written a book called ""Honey in Modern Wounds Management."" Cooper told CNN that there are many components in honey that contribute to its antibacterial nature. She says its high sugar content, low water content and low pH are all factors. Additionally, some honey produces hydrogen peroxide, which can kill bacteria. Since 2004, Britain's National Health Service has licensed the use of manuka-honey wound dressings and sterilized medical grade manuka-honey creams.","Research has shown that honey can have powerful antibacterial properties .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Thousands of Muslims gathered Friday on Capitol Hill for a day of prayer that organizers said was intended to inspire American Muslims and non-Muslims alike. People traveled from all over the United States to attend the Capitol Hill event, organizer Abdul Malik said. ""America is not perfect,"" Abdul Malik, an organizer of the event called Islam on Capitol Hill, told the crowd. ""But I will say something it took me my whole adult life to come to: America is not perfect, but I want to tell the truth: It is one of the best places in the world to live."" Organizers had hoped that 50,000 people would show up for the Friday afternoon prayer session, which took place at the foot of the U.S. Capitol. There were also anti-Muslim protesters near the event. Earlier, Malik said, ""This is not a protest, it is a day of prayer, of devotion, hoping that we can work ... for the betterment of the world community."" He added, ""We can come together and work together for the common good."" He said that Muslims in the United States have a ""unique responsibility"" and that the event seeks to inspire Muslims and all Americans. ""America represents, still, a beacon of hope,"" he said. Malik said conversations about the event began only a few months ago. ""It's amazing,"" he said. ""The Web site has gotten more than 3 million hits already."" Friday's event was focused on a 1 p.m. prayer, and a reception and banquet were planned afterward. Malik said attendees were traveling from all over the United States -- including Texas, Florida and Georgia -- as well as from other countries, such as Britain and Canada. ""The beautiful thing ... about this, is that we have a good representation of the uniqueness and beauty of what Islam stands for,"" he said. Besides the protesters, the event drew other criticism. Malik said he had received some ""very nasty e-mails."" And one Christian leader warned of a strategy to ""Islamize"" American society. ""It is important for Christians to understand that Friday's Muslim prayer initiative is part of a well-defined strategy to Islamize American society and replace the Bible with the Koran, the cross with the Islamic crescent and the church bells with the Athan [the Muslim call to prayer],"" the Rev.

"BEIJING, China (CNN)  -- What's in a name? Westerners are more accustomed to names that describe the ingredients and how they are cooked. Local dishes like ""Husband and wife's lung slice"" or ""Chicken without sexual life"" conjure lots of furrowed eyebrows on famished foreigners. So, with the Olympics a few short weeks away, China is giving its cuisine a linguistic makeover. It is proposing that restaurants change the names of exotic, but bizarrely named, delicacies to make them more delectable for the estimated 50,000 visitors arriving in August for the Summer Games. The appetizer ""Husband and wife's lung slice"" is taking on the more appetizing ""Beef and ox tripe in chili sauce."" ""Chicken without sexual life"" has been transformed into ""Steamed pullet."" The government has put down more than 2,000 proposed names in a 170-page book that it has offered to Beijing hotels, according to state media. ""Thanks to the pamphlet, we do not have to struggle to come up with the English translations of dishes any more, which is usually time consuming,"" a senior manager at the four-star Guangzhou Hotel in downtown Beijing told the Xinhua news agency. The Chinese say the names of their dishes focus more on appearance than taste or smell. But Westerners are more accustomed to names that describe the ingredients and how they are cooked -- such as pot roast. The government realizes local names are a matter of taste, but don't want them to get lost in translation. Hence, the spicy Sichuanese dish ""Bean curd made by a pock-marked woman"" has been bestowed the more palatable ""Mapo tofu."" Not everyone is pleased. ""The process of standardizing a menu translation is a double-edged sword,"" wrote columnist Raymond Zhou in the China Daily newspaper. It ""removes the ambiguity and unintended humor"" and ""takes away the fun and the rich connotation.

"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- Two U.S. filmmakers were injured Saturday when their small plane crashed into a three-story residential building in downtown Nairobi. People gather around the wreckage of a plane that struck a building in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi on Saturday. Dan Parris, 25, and Rob Lehr, 26, both from St. Louis, Missouri, were shooting an independent documentary on poverty in Africa. Both men were hospitalized and expected to survive, according to David Peterka, who was part of the film crew, but was not aboard the plane. He said that all four aboard the plane were Americans. A flight engineer, whose name was not released, was critically injured and was in a coma, Peterka said. The pilot, whose name has not yet been released, was killed in the crash. The crew had been in the east African nation for four days and was shooting video of Kibera, one of the largest slums in Africa. The plane was headed to nearby Wilson Airport, where most light aircraft land in the Kenyan capital. ""The pilot had warned that he was going to hover and go slow,"" Peterka said. ""They were surprised when they went to about 50 feet off the ground --- and then they hit electrical lines and the plane flipped into the building."" Just before the plane crashed, the listening devices went off and they could not communicate with the pilot, Peterka said. Peterka said Lehr, who was ejected because the doors were open for filming, ran back in to rescue the others. Parris crawled out and Lehr, with the help of bystanders, pulled the pilot and the engineer out as the plane burst into flames, Peterka said. ""Local residents were using water, dirt to put the fire out"" before the fire department arrived, Peterka said. ""Before the plane crashed, witnesses said it was flying unusually low,"" said Francis Mwaka, a Kenyan federal communications official. The four-seater plane was owned by African Inland Missions company. No one on the ground was injured, Mwaka said. The crash is under investigation.

"(CNN) -- Switzerland defender Philippe Senderos is in talks to leave Arsenal and join English Premier League rivals Everton, according to the Liverpool-based side. Philippe Senderos is seeking to leave Arsenal to keep his World Cup hopes alive. The 24-year-old has been out of favor with the London club for the past year or so, and spent last season on loan with Italy's AC Milan. The center-back made only 15 appearances in his injury-hit stint with the Rossoneri, and returned to Arsenal where he has a year left on his contract. Everton chairman Bill Kenwright confirmed that talks were underway, but said that no deal had been done despite an earlier claim by the Swiss Football Federation. ""We have been negotiating with Arsenal for the transfer of Philippe. Nothing has been concluded yet but talks are on going,"" Kenwright told Everton's official Web site on Tuesday. Everton face the possible departure of England defender Joleon Lescott, the subject of two bids from big-spending EPL rivals Manchester City.  Transfer gossip: City to bid again for Lescott. Manager David Moyes has rejected both offers and is determined to keep the player, who has been ruled out of recent pre-season friendly action due to a hip injury picked up on the tour of the United States. Moyes needs cover for injured center-back Phil Jagielka, who is not expected to return to action until November. The Swiss Football Federation had said on its official Web site on Monday that Senderos had agreed to join Everton because he needed regular first-team action ahead of next year's World Cup finals in South Africa. Switzerland are level on points with Greece at the top of Group Two after six of 10 games, with the winner qualifying directly and the runner-up hoping to go into one of the four play-offs. Senderos joined Arsenal in the summer of 2003 from Swiss club Servette, and established himself in the first team alongside Kolo Toure when regular Sol Campbell was injured. However, he missed the 2006 Champions League final defeat by Barcelona due to his own injury, with England defender Campbell returning in his place to score the opening goal of the 2-1 reverse. Senderos missed the start of the 2006-07 season after suffering a shoulder problem at the World Cup finals, and subsequently struggled to break back into the Arsenal team. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has a wealth of central defensive resources despite selling Toure to City last month, having brought in Belgium international Thomas Vermaelen from Ajax in June. William Gallas, Johan Djourou, Mikael Silvestre and Alex Song are also competing for first-team places.","Philippe Senderos in talks to leave Arsenal and join English rivals Everton .

"(CNN) -- After nearly 40 years of recorded increases, the number of immigrants living in the United States remained flat between 2007 and 2008, recent statistics released by the U.S. Census Bureau show. The number of naturalized citizens in the U.S. increased, partly attributed to voter drives for the 2008 election. According to the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, the U.S. foreign-born population represented about 12.5 percent of the population in 2008, down from 12.6 percent in 2007. Taking into account the margin of error, it was possible that the immigrant population remained even. ""Between '07 and '08 there really wasn't that much of a change,"" said Elizabeth Grieco, chief of immigration statistics staff at the Census Bureau. But given the steep upward trend in the foreign-born population since 1970, no change is big news. The American Community Survey collects data from about 3 million addresses each year, and provides one of the most complete pictures of the population, according to the bureau. The survey doesn't give a reason for the leveling off, but experts pointed to the economic downturn and the resulting high unemployment as factors behind the shift. ""The recession has had a significant effect on immigrants' decisions on whether to come to the U.S.,"" said Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. Would-be unauthorized immigrants and legal temporary workers are mostly the ones who have decided to stay put in their home countries for now, Mittelstadt said. The largest declines in the foreign-born population were in states that were hardest hit by the recession, including California, Florida and Arizona. Mittelstadt noted, however, that those immigrants already in the United States appear to be staying. A recent study by the Pew Hispanic Center concluded that emigration from Mexico, the largest source of immigrants to the United States, slowed at least 40 percent between mid-decade and 2008, based on national population surveys in the United States and Mexico, as well as Border Patrol apprehension figures. The Mexican-born population in the United States dropped by about 300,000 between 2007 and 2008, according to census data. The new Census statistics show that for the first time since the American Community Survey was fully implemented in 2005, the number of noncitizens decreased, Grieco said. There were about 21.6 million noncitizens in 2008, down from 21.9 million in 2007. The label noncitizens includes both legal residents and illegal immigrants. Along with the decline in the noncitizen population, however, there was a notable increase in the number of naturalized citizens, Grieco said. The number of individuals who are naturalized citizens increased to 43 percent of the foreign-born population in 2008 from 42.5 percent in 2007. The Census survey matches reports from the Department of Homeland Security on the rise of naturalization applications. ""Naturalizations grew at a record pace between 2006 and 2008, with a total of 2.4 million immigrants becoming new citizens in the United States,"" according to a DHS statement. A significant fee increase imposed in 2007 for naturalization applications and an awareness of citizenship brought on during voter registration drives for the 2008 election help explain the increase, Mittelstadt said.","Bureau official: ""Between '07 and '08 there really wasn't"" much immigration change .

"BALTIMORE, Maryland (CNN) -- You know you've arrived at Bengies Drive-In Theatre when you first see the giant movie marquee, announcing the features showing that weekend. Each letter has to be placed and adjusted by hand, as it did when the theater first opened. Bengies Drive-In Theatre has been owned by the same family since it opened in 1956. ""As far as the operation of the drive-in goes, I'm kind of a die-hard. I try to make it run the way it did, to bring a little bit back of the '50s. ... the integrity and the innocence of that age,"" says Bengies owner D. Edward Vogel, who claims to have the largest outdoor movie screen in the country at 52 feet by 120 feet. Vogel has spent most of his life trying to maintain the feel and charm of the Baltimore, Maryland, drive-in movie theater that his family opened in 1956. Vogel wants moviegoers to have the same experience as he did when he went to his family's outdoor theater as a child, although he knows that people today have many more entertainment options. ""Sometimes I'm actually taken aback with the amount of children that are fascinated with this,"" says Vogel. ""Thinking of what their options are, with modern devices and videos and all that, that they are so taken aback . with what happens here."" Vogel started learning, at age 9, the secrets of running a movie theater from his father, Jack Vogel. He has worked tirelessly since to maintain the theater as it was in its glory days. Vogel even operates the same machines that he did as a child; the projection room is filled with the original projectors, which Vogel cleans and cares for each night. And for each movie, threading the film is a complex process far removed from the simplicity of inserting a DVD into the player that we know today. Once threaded, the film spins around as each frame follows an intricate path from the tray, to the projector, until it is shown on the gigantic screen.  Watch the drive-in come to life » . The scene immediately invokes a feeling of nostalgia, reminding us why they were called ""motion pictures"" way back when. Yet, Vogel is quick to tell you that keeping the 53-year-old business alive hasn't always been easy. At Bengies, each night is a double feature, so guests can see at least two movies for $8 a person. Vogel estimates that Bengies makes 60 percent of its revenue from ticket sales, and the rest comes from concession purchases. There's a strict ""no outside food"" policy, and he's open about the fact that the food sales help keep the business open. The waterfront property would be more profitable as condos, he says, and his father planned to build them before Vogel took over the theater in the 1980s. He was only able to avoid closing by cutting costs and staff. ""My parents had a union operator in the booth, they had a manager, they had a concessionaire. I am all of those things, so that has changed,"" Vogel says. Vogel even acts as the host. Known only as ""the voice"" to his audiences, he starts each night by using the theater's speaker system to welcome everyone to his venue. ""When you see the sun setting, and the shadow being cast on that screen, no matter what has happened during that day, good, bad or indifferent, I become a different person when I turn the microphone on."" Besides the challenges of being a small business owner, Vogel's efforts to maintain the integrity of the movie-going experience is challenged by another intrusion of this modern world -- light pollution. Between car headlights and brightly lit businesses nearby, a once-dark sky is now polluted with obtrusive light. Bengies asks that drivers turn their headlights off when entering the grounds of the theater. But over the years, it has been the outside light from other businesses that bleeds into the surrounding sky, making the giant screen hard to see. For solutions to such predicaments, Vogel turns to the owners of other drive-in theaters that have managed to survive since the 1930s. He is an active member of a drive-in theater owners association and is working with other owners across the country to support each other. ""They would all have easier lives if they opened Laundromats in the right location, but they don't. They endeavor; there is a passion about it,"" Vogel says. It is a passion that his audience seems to appreciate. As the sun lowers in the sky and eventually sets behind the screen, the ticket booth is opened on a Sunday night in autumn. People make the trip to the last drive-in theater in the Baltimore area. They set up their chairs, and some sit in their classic cars to enjoy the show. It's an experience Vogel hopes to keep around for generations to come.","Bengies Drive-In Theatre hasn't changed much in its 53-year history .

"(CNN) -- She added smart to sexy as a Bond girl opposite Pierce Brosnan's 007, and proved her dramatic and action credentials in ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon,"" but for actress Michelle Yeoh, life and acting are both all about balance. Michelle Yeoh: ""There are reasons why you do movies. It's for the love of it."" ""I think it's very boring for my audience, just to see me in the regular roles. I love my action films. And I think right now, I have a nice balance,"" she told CNN's Talk Asia. Poise and balance are something that Yeoh is naturally blessed with. Her childhood dream of becoming a professional ballerina was dashed when she sustained an injury while training at the Royal Academy of Dance in London. However, she continued to study completing a degree in dance and a minor in drama, before serving as Miss Malaysia at the age of 21, which was more of an ambassadorial role for the country's tourism industry than bikini modeling. Making her film debut in an action movie in 1984, she made further appearances in Hong Kong action films doing her own stunts, until she married millionaire Hong Kong businessman Dickson Poon in 1988 and put her career on hold. On giving up acting for the sake of her married life she said: ""At that time, it's very difficult to try and juggle a normal life, be where your husband is, try to start a family life, and filming months on end in another country. So I weighed my options. I am a person that believes, you have to give your all. There's no half measure in doing things. You do it well or at least you've got to give it your best shot."" The couple divorced three years later and Yeoh resumed her film career in 1992 in the Jackie Chan smash-hit ""Police Story 3."" While she continued to use her athleticism in her roles and do her own stunts, in the pursuit of playing good characters and that all-important balance, she credits the directors she has chosen to work with. ""I look at the scripts and you can understand where the story is going ... but it's a director with a vision that brings it to life,"" she said. ""There are reasons why you do movies. It's for the love of it or you're thinking of your paycheck. And you have to find your own balance."" When it came to doing ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" Ang Lee was the essential ingredient. ""I did it really because I adore Ang Lee. That's a true film maker, where they move you, they bring you to places where you can't imagine but want to be."" But being an all-or-nothing person has taken its toll when it has come to the stunts she has performed. Yeoh tore her anterior cruciate ligament after the first sequence she performed for ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" which meant that only the dramatic scenes in the film could be shot until she had recovered. Yeoh has turned her attention to producing as well as acting and found it a challenging experience. ""As an actor you would be judged on how your performance is and so that's where your focus is. It's a very selfish environment and that sense, because as you know, you can't make excuses afterwards. But as a producer, you have to make sure everyone is well protected and everyone is safe. And if anything goes wrong, it's all on your shoulders,"" she told CNN. The films she produced, 2002's ""The Touch"" and ""Sliver Hawk"" from 2004 were panned by critics, but she makes no excuses: ""That's the nature of the business. You should never take these things personally when it works or doesn't work."" And when it comes to passing on what she's learned to young Asian actors, her advice is typically practical. ""For any Asian face, or any Asian girls that have dreams, aspirations or doing crossover work in Hollywood, you must have the language. These are your tools. And then afterwards, the right face, the right demeanor, and the right chemistry.""","Trained dancer turned to acting after injury at college .

"(CNN) -- Mexican authorities have arrested a reputed senior member of a major Tijuana-based drug cartel after a shootout, U.S. authorities confirmed Sunday. Eduardo Arellano-Felix was arrested in Tijuana, Mexico, on Saturday. Eduardo Arellano-Felix was arrested at a Tijuana, Mexico, residence Saturday, said Special Agent Eileen Zeidler of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration office in San Diego, California. She said federal authorities received a tip on the whereabouts of Arellano-Felix and provided the information to Mexican authorities. No other details were immediately available. Arellano-Felix was one of the last wanted members of the powerful and brutal trafficking organization bearing his family name, authorities say. His brother, reputed Mexican drug lord Javier Arellano-Felix, was captured by U.S. authorities in August 2006 off the shore of southern Baja California. The brothers were on the top of the DEA's Most Wanted List, carrying rewards of $5 million dollars for their capture. Officials say seven brothers and four sisters of the Arellano-Felix family inherited the Tijuana cartel from Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo in 1989 after his arrest for drug trafficking. Eduardo was the last remaining brother who had an active role in the cartel. Today, the notorious cartel is split into two factions -- one headed by Eduardo Garcia Simental and another headed by Eduardo Arellano-Felix's nephew, Fernando Sanchez Arellano. The two sides have engaged in brutal fighting, accounting for nearly all the violence in Tijuana, according to the DEA. More than 400 people have been killed in drug-related violence in Tijuana this year. While Eduardo Arellano-Felix was not the boss of the cartel, DEA officials said his nephew sought his advice on decisions. Zeidler said the arrest of Arellano-Felix was a significant step in potentially dismantling the cartel. ""You pull the foundation out of the house and the house is going to come down,"" she said. ""[Arellano-Felix] was the foundation.""","Eduardo Arellano-Felix was arrested at a Tijuana residence Saturday .

"(CNN)  -- Two former Blackwater employees have made statements against Blackwater Worldwide and its founder Erik Prince, accusing the security company and its former CEO of murder and other serious crimes in Iraq, according to court documents filed this week. Blackwater founder Erik Prince, shown here before a congressional panel in 2007, recently left the company. The sworn affidavits by an ex-Marine who joined Blackwater and another employee -- listed in the documents as ""John Doe No. 1"" and ""John Doe No. 2"" -- are part of a civil lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Virginia against Prince on behalf of Iraqi families who say they lost loved ones at the hands of his company. Blackwater, recently renamed Xe, issued a statement Tuesday, saying it would respond ""to the anonymous unsubstantiated and offensive assertions put forward by the plaintiffs,"" in a brief to be filed August 17. The company had a security contract for operations in Iraq under the U.S. State Department until May, when the federal government declined to renew the contract. The decision did not affect other contracts Blackwater has with the State Department, a senior State department official told CNN earlier this year. Several of the plaintiffs are connected to a September 2007 shooting incident in Baghdad in which the Iraqi government says security guards, then employed by Blackwater, fired upon and killed 17 Iraqi civilians. The affidavits by the two witnesses, who did not want to be identified in the court documents filed Monday for fear of retaliatory ""violence,""  paint a menacing portrait of Prince, who recently resigned from his company. ""First, he views himself as a Christian crusader tasked with eliminating Muslims and the Islamic faith from the globe. ... Second, Mr. Prince is motivated by greed,"" says John Doe No. 2. ""He sought every opportunity to deploy men to Iraq in order to earn more money from the United States government."" He refers to another incident when he ""first arrived in Baghdad"" in which he saw fellow employees pulling weapons out of a shipment of dog food -- the allegation being smuggling. John Doe No. 1 describes witnessing one incident in Baquba, where a Blackwater employee allegedly fired into a passing single-passenger vehicle without provocation. He says he's heard of similar instances of excessive or deadly force from other Blackwater employees. However, neither gives clear details about the incidents they describe, such as specific dates or locations. The court documents filed Tuesday are in response to a defense motion to dismiss the suit. The suit says the affidavits were also submitted to the Justice Department, which is engaged in an ongoing investigation into the Blackwater case. No criminal charges have been filed against Prince. ""It is obvious that Plaintiffs have chosen to slander Mr. Prince rather than raise legal arguments or actual facts that will be considered by a court of law. We are happy to engage them there,"" the company statement said. ""We question the judgment of anyone who relies upon and [reiterates] anonymous declarations."" Earlier this year, five former Blackwater security guards pleaded not guilty to federal charges of manslaughter and other serious crimes stemming from a September 16, 2007, shooting. Their trial is set for February 2010.","Statements are part of civil suit brought by Iraqi families who've lost loved ones .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Federal prosecutors Tuesday urged a Florida judge to sentence actor Wesley Snipes to three years in prison and fine him $5 million to demonstrate to taxpayers that refusal to pay income taxes carries severe penalties. Wesley Snipes was acquitted of the most serious charges against him. Snipes is scheduled to be sentenced April 24 by U.S. District Judge William Hodges in Ocala, Florida, on three counts of failure to file federal income tax returns. One week after vowing to crack down on ""tax defiers,"" the Justice Department filed court papers seeking the maximum penalty for the three misdemeanor counts on which Snipes was convicted. ""This case presents the court with a singular opportunity to deter tax fraud nationwide,"" the government said in its sentencing recommendation. Snipes had been charged with felony conspiracy counts for participating in a scheme that rejects the legal foundation of the tax system. However, a jury accepted his argument that he was innocently duped by errant tax advisers, and acquitted him on the most serious charges. ""The fact that Snipes was acquitted on two felony charges and convicted 'only' on three misdemeanor counts has been portrayed in the mainstream media as a 'victory' for Snipes,"" the government document says. ""The troubling implication of such coverage for the millions of average citizens who are aware of this case is that the rich and famous Wesley Snipes has 'gotten away with it.' In the end the criminal conduct of Snipes must not be seen in such a light."" Assistant Attorney General Nathan Hochman, head of the Justice Department's Tax Division, last week promised to beef up the government's efforts to pursue those engaged in a variety of schemes making legal assertions that income taxes are either voluntary or unconstitutional. ""For nearly a decade Snipes has engaged in a campaign of criminal tax conduct combining brazen defiance with insidious concealment,"" the prosecutors say. ""By these means Snipes has escaped paying more than $15 million in income tax to the IRS and has pursued an intended fraudulent harm to the United States Treasury of more than $41 million."" The document says Snipes shipped millions of dollars to accounts in Switzerland, Antigua and the Isle of Man to avoid taxes. ""Given defendant's income, earning capacity, and financial resources, both disclosed and undisclosed, the United States submits that a fine of at least $5 million is warranted,"" the sentencing recommendation says. The 35-page argument for the stiffest possible penalty ends with a dramatic flair. ""In the defendant Wesley Snipes, the court is presented with a wealthy, famous and inveterate tax scofflaw. If ever a tax offender was deserving of being held accountable to the maximum extent for his criminal wrongdoing, Snipes is that defendant,"" it says. The IRS is also seeking repayment of all taxes and interest through civil court proceedings. E-mail to a friend .","Federal prosecutors urge judge to sentence Wesley Snipes to 3 years .

"Editor's note: Sarah Hughes won the gold medal in figure skating at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah, and is a graduate of Yale University. Medalist Sarah Hughes says the Games are about excellence and unity. (CNN) -- What are the first thoughts that pop into your mind when you hear the word Olympics? Probably something synonymous with excellence, greatness, excitement, achievement. Maybe it's the striking image of Nadia Comaneci scoring a perfect 10 etched in your mind, or the experience of following Michael Phelps' quest to win a record-breaking eight gold medals last summer in Beijing, China. Or is it the thrill of watching the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team winning the gold medal in Lake Placid, stacked up against unimaginable odds, that occupies that space? I could go on and on, but whatever image the Olympics has for you is probably accompanied by a feeling of pride, happiness, joyfulness, maybe even a childlike glee. Sometimes it's the simple way you can sum up your response to the question -- and perhaps that's the point of asking the question -- but it would be foolish to ignore other aspects of the Games that contribute to making the event happen. Although the presence of public officials at host-city bids shows the International Olympic Committee that they are behind the bid and will be supportive, such appearances are not required. On Friday, President Obama, a Chicago, Illinois, resident for many years, will arrive in Copenhagen, Denmark (his wife is already there), to support and try to persuade the IOC voters in favor of the 2016 Chicago bid. Obama's visit to Copenhagen will make him the first U.S. president to attend an Olympic host-city vote. His visit will not be the first by a president (or prime minister) whose country went on to win a bid for the Games. British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife were in Singapore lobbying IOC members for the 2012 Summer Games host-city vote when London was awarded the event. Two years later, Russian President Vladimir Putin went to the host-city vote in Guatemala when Sochi, a relatively unknown city, won the right to host the 2014 Winter Games. The other 2016 contenders vying for votes from the 100-plus eligible members of the IOC are Madrid, Spain; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and Tokyo, Japan. Michelle Obama, a lifelong Chicagoan enthusiastically championing the U.S. bid, is displaying her ""Olympic spirit."" On Monday, the eve of her visit to Copenhagen, she spoke of being ready to woo each voter individually if need be: ""Gloves are off. I'm talking to everybody. That's what my schedule looks like."" Sounding like an Olympic competitor already herself, she added that she didn't ""think there's one person left off."" It is easy to come to the conclusion that I might be biased, having won a gold medal in figure skating at the 2002 Salt Lake City Games, but I was an American and a fan long before those Games, and I will be one long after. The memories, unity and patriotism from the Salt Lake Games wasn't about any one particular thing but about all those little ""things"" coming together: the result of what the participants -- the fans, volunteers, competitors, coaches, moms, dads, sisters, brothers, cities and nations -- created by sharing the best we have to offer with one another. That's what the Olympics are about. They are about greatness, they are about excellence, but above all, the Games are about unity. In a September 10 letter to IOC members, Obama wrote about how he ""sees the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games as an extraordinary opportunity for America to renew our bonds of friendship and welcome the world to our shores with open arms."" And on Friday, when Obama arrives in Copenhagen, he will be joined by Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, newly appointed Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama and King Juan Carlos of Spain. Let the Games begin. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sarah Hughes.","Sarah Hughes: Obama is among other world leaders who have sought Olympics .

"BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN) -- In his first public appearance since the ""Beer Summit"" at the White House, Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates joked about his controversial arrest last month in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and said he likes police Sgt. James Crowley. Sgt. James Crowley and professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. sit for beers with the president and vice president Thursday. ""I offered to get his kids into Harvard if he doesn't arrest me anymore,"" Gates said. Gates was speaking Sunday at the Martha's Vineyard Book Festival where he signed copies of his book, ""In Search of our Roots."" The professor said he plans on meeting with Crowley again. ""I offered for the two of us to have lunch together, one-on-one, or go to a Red Sox game, or a Celtics games, or maybe the families can get together for dinner. Why not?"" Gates had a face-to-face meeting and a beer with Crowley at the White House last week, a move orchestrated by President Obama in an attempt to defuse racial tensions that had erupted following Gates' arrest. Gates called the president's gesture ""brilliant."" Crowley arrested Gates on July 16 when the officer responded to a call of a possible home break-in at the Cambridge residence. Gates was charged with disorderly conduct for allegedly yelling at the officer and protesting his actions. But Gates, who is black, claimed he never raised his voice and accused Crowley of racial profiling. Charges against the professor were later dropped. The tone at the book fair turned more serious when someone asked Gates how the arrest has affected him. ""I'm still trying to figure that out and processing it. It was stressful. I was worried about my daughters."" Fortunately, he said, the press was not camped out at his family home like they were at the Cambridge residence, which is owned by the university. He admitted to receiving bomb threats and deaths threats and said the university is encouraging him to move. ""I haven't been back to the Cambridge house since I got arrested so I have to make that decision."" He also said he has had to change his phone numbers and close his public e-mail account. ""I received thousands of fan letters but some of the e-mails were from crazy wacko people who wrote 'You should die,' 'You're a racist,'"" Still, Gates said he doesn't want to exaggerate the trauma of the arrest. ""A lot of people go through far worse. I was in jail for four hours, not four years or four months or four days,"" he said. ""The night before I went to the White House, I had a dream that I got arrested in the White House,"" he said. Then he joked, ""But it's cool; I was OK.""","Professor on officer who arrested him: We could lunch or go to a Sox game .

"(CNN) -- ""Saturday Night Live"" was formed in the crucible of the mid-1970s, when Watergate brought respect for politicians to all-time lows, the counterculture was taking over comedy, and many television viewers were seeking out something fresh and bold. Fred Armisen played Barack Obama in a talked-about sketch Saturday night on ""Saturday Night Live."" It was a powerful combination -- and after 34 years, the combination of ""SNL"" and politics can still strike sparks among political observers. The most recent example came this past weekend when Fred Armisen, as President Obama, chided ""those on the right"" for saying that he was ""turning this great country into something that resembles the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany."" Not true, said Armisen as Obama. ""When you look at my record,"" he said, ""it's very clear what I've done so far -- and that is nothing.""   Watch the sketch -- and the reaction » . The sketch has caused a rumble among the inside-the-Beltway chattering classes and New York news nabobs. Wrote Washington Post blogger Jonathan Capehart, ""When your 'friends' start talking about you like this -- and friends with a huge megaphone and a feel for the national mood -- the White House should listen."" ""Humor with some truth in it is always dangerous. Make no mistake, a drumbeat of belittlement can damage a president,"" added CNN political contributor Ed Rollins in a column. The White House had no comment when asked about the sketch by CNN. ""SNL"" cast members weren't available for interviews, an NBC representative said. ""SNL"" creator Lorne Michaels also turned down an interview request but has said the show doesn't take sides. ""I think 'SNL's' role is, the moment they're in power, we're the opposition,"" he told CNN's Alina Cho last year. ""We're not partisan. We're not, you know, we're not putting on anything that we don't believe is funny.""  Video gallery: ""SNL"" takes on presidents through the years » . The recent sketch is indicative of the end of Obama's honeymoon, Syracuse University pop culture professor Robert Thompson says, but he doesn't want to read more into it than that. ""Comedy is about going after the people in power,"" he said. The president has also taken recent shots from ""The Daily Show"" and ""Real Time with Bill Maher."" ""What this says is that the comedy-industrial complex has turned its sights on the reigning president of the United States,"" he said. But, he added, ""I wouldn't put this into the meme category,"" referring to concepts that travel so quickly they take on a life of their own, such as Tina Fey's Sarah Palin sketches from last year. ""The [Obama] sketch wasn't that funny."" Indeed, the show's overall impact is often mixed, observes Slate columnist and Rutgers media studies professor David Greenberg. It can ""capture or intensify"" a storyline that's being passed through the news media, but the show is more a barometer that can change with events. ""It's not incapable of influencing things,"" he said, noting the show's slash-and-burn '70s satire and Fey's Palin parody. ""But since the early '80s, those moments are pretty rare. ... You'll see good impersonations but not the underlying critique you had with, say, Dan Aykroyd as [Richard] Nixon."" Besides, he added, the Obama sketch may have titillated the politico-media crowd, but he wonders whether its impact went any wider. ""I'm a political junkie,"" he said, ""and this is the first I've heard of it."" Indeed, the ratings for the episode were a far cry from last year's Palin-fest -- from a 7.3 rating for the same week in 2008, to 4.7 -- and the Armisen sketch didn't get the frenzied online dispersion the Palin sketches did. iReport.com: 'SNL' won't hurt Obama . However, Obama should be concerned about one thing, observes Thompson. In general, ""SNL"" mocked previous presidents' personal characteristics, such as Clinton's outsized appetites or George W. Bush's struggles with spoken English. With Obama -- who lacks the same kind of easily caricatured traits, Thompson says -- the show went after his record. ""In some ways,"" Thompson said, ""he's vulnerable to more serious damage.""","Recent ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch attacked President Obama .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Rafael Nadal's shock French Open exit at the hands of a player ranked outside the top 20 is already attracting suggestions that it may be the biggest upset in tennis history. Rafael Nadal faces media after his shock loss to Sweden's Robin Soderling at the French Open on Sunday . Nadal, the world number one had never lost a game at Roland Garros, winning the previous four titles in a row. However, Sweden's Robin Soderling proved too good for the ""King of Clay,"" beating him 6-2 6-7 6-4 7-6. The official French Open Web site called it ""one of the greatest upsets in Grand Slam history,"" while other news outlets have rushed to praise the Swede for the ""game of his life."" The result leaves the men's draw at the French Open tournament wide open -- with Roger Federer and Andy Murray now the highest-ranked players remaining. Undoubtedly a massive upset, Nadal's loss also raises the question of what have been the biggest men's Grand Slam upsets in tennis history. Is this is the biggest? Below, in no particular order, are ten of the most shocking.What do you think the biggest upset in recent tennis history is? Tell us in the Sound Off box below. 1. Robin Soderling beats Rafael Nadal, French Open 2009 Spain's clay master was unbeaten at Roland Garros and looking for his fifth title in a row when he was shocked by the 23rd seed Swedish player. Soderling was too good for Nadal, and deserved the win. 2. Michael Chang beats Lendl and Edberg, French Open 1989 American Michael Chang etched his name in history by winning the 1989 French Open aged just 17 years and three months. He beat legends Ivan Lendl and Stefan Edberg (in an epic five set final) to win the event and he is still the youngest winner of a Grand Slam. 3. George Bastl beats Pete Sampras, Wimbledon 2002 Swiss player Bastl was ranked 145 in the world when he took on the seven-time champion of Wimbledon, Pete Sampras. Bastl, who only got into the tournament as a lucky loser after failing to qualify, beat the American in five sets. 4. Mark Edmondson wins the 1976 Australian Open  The Australian only ever won one Grand Slam event, and he beat defending champion John Newcombe in the final to do it. The most remarkable point however, was that he was ranked 212th in the world when he did it. He remains the lowest-ranked player to win a Grand Slam title. 5. Goran Ivanisevic wins 2001 Wimbledon Left-handed Ivanisevic had lost the Wimbledon final three times before he finally won it in 2001. The eventual victory was a near-miracle, as he had only entered the tournament as a wild card.

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- When we requested an interview with members of the Communist Youth League, I expected an army of suits with well-rehearsed answers. Instead, we met three students casually dressed in jeans, just 18 to 23 years old. Christina Zhang wants to be a linguistics teacher or professor. She plans to attend graduate school. The interview was arranged by the State Council Information Office, in advance of the upcoming 60th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Unlike many government-sanctioned shoots, it was not carefully choreographed or closely monitored. The students did arrive with a ""minder"" of sorts, but he was no older than them and didn't interrupt the conversation. We sat down for tea at Ritan Park in downtown Beijing. My questions seemed to be more sensitive than they expected, but the students remained poised and answered every one. All of the students are members of the Chinese Communist Party and the Communist Youth League, the same organization that launched the successful careers of Chinese President Hu Jintao and many of China's other top leaders. ""I think Communism is an ideal state of society that everyone should pursue,"" said Natalie Chen, an 18-year-old freshman and finance major at Peking University's Guanghua School of Management. ""In the Communist society, everything is fair in economics, in politics, in education. Everybody has equal opportunity and that's a great society."" ""Do you think everything is fair in China?"" I asked Natalie. ""At present I have to say no,"" she said. ""But, we are of course making progress towards it.""  Watch Chang's interview with the students » . Young students like Chen are the future of the Chinese Communist Party, which now is the largest political party in the world with 75 million members. It has come a long way. In 1949, the Communist Party was a group of mostly revolutionary farmers, who came to power on the heels of civil war.  See how China has changed over 60 years » . ""The party was a rag tag organization you might say,"" said David Shambaugh, a visiting fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and political science professor at George Washington University. ""They had no experience in ruling, but a lot of experience in fighting and they were faced with a number of problems of how to set up a government and run the country."" The first three decades of Communist rule were tumultuous, marred by backward isolation and a destructive Cultural Revolution. However, the next 30 years transformed China from the inside out, with the implementation of new economic goals and gradual openness to the outside world. The Communist Party now is largely credited with delivering the country from isolation to economic prosperity. Despite this achievement, perhaps the party's most astounding achievement in 60 years is, quite simply, surviving as the one and only political party in a massive country. ""To be adaptable and flexible is a path to survival,"" said Shambaugh. ""So this has been a very adaptable, and I would argue, eclectic party, borrowing bits and pieces from different political systems all around the world and studying other political systems."" Yet, in being so adaptable, analysts say the party has run the risk of having a lot of slogans and little substance. Slogans such as ""the scientific mode of development,"" ""socialism with Chinese characteristics,"" and ""harmonious society"" often cannot be explained by the average Chinese citizen. ""These are all current slogans, but people are not really sure what they mean,"" Shambaugh said. Indeed some of the party's youngest members provided vague answers when asked for what exactly the Communist Party stands. ""I think we have a goal,"" said 23-year-old Christina Zhang, an undergraduate in linguistics at Beijing Normal University. ""That is to reach a harmonious society. That is our dream ... I believe we are sure to realize our dream."" ""We discuss science, we discuss thought, we discuss everything,"" added Lin De-yuan, a 23-year-old first-year graduate student in Marxist studies at the Chinese Youth University of Political Sciences. He also suggested I read ""the book by Karl Marx,"" referring to the Communist Manifesto. China's younger generation has been criticized for caring too much about securing good jobs instead of about policy and politics. These days, it is widely regarded that many young people join the party, not because they share Communist ideals, but because it looks good on their resumes. Chen, Zhang and Lin denied joining the party for personal gain. Chen plans to become a banker or a politician, Zhang aspires to be a teacher and Lin dreams of becoming an NBA referee. However, they do acknowledge joining the party may have some benefits and some members actively use their party credentials to achieve certain career goals. ""Admittedly, some people join the party with their own purpose of getting a good job, or getting a promotion,"" Chen said. ""But that's why we are still having a fierce battle with corruption in the party."" In fact, corruption is one of the biggest challenges the Communist Party will face in the years ahead. Young Communists like Chen, Zhang and Lin will be responsible for rising to these types of challenges and shaping the party's future. Their generation may determine whether the Communist Party is still China's one and only ruling party 60 years from now.","Unlike many government-sanctioned shoots, this one was not closely monitored .

"(Tribune Media Services) -- Alexandra Seldin prepays for a rental car through Alamo's Web site. But when her flight is canceled, and she arrives a day late, the company charges her three times more than it originally said it would. Is it allowed to do that? And is there any hope for a refund? A customer's late arrival cost her an additional $1,116 for her car rental. Q: My car rental company has more than tripled the rate it charged me, and I don't know what to do. I had prepaid $390 for the car through Alamo's Web site. When my flight was canceled, I called Alamo to tell it I could not get the car until the next day. I was told that my reservation would be held for 24 hours. I picked up the car the next day and returned it on time. When I dropped off the rental, a representative said the computer system was down. But when I got my bill the next month, there was an additional $1,116 charge because of the late pick up. I believe this additional charge to be unfair and am requesting a refund. I believe Alamo should honor its promise of the prepaid amount as well as the representation that my reservation would be held for 24 hours. Can you help? -- Alexandra Seldin, San Diego, California . A: So Alamo is charging you another $1,116 even though you rented one of its cars for one day less. Where's the logic in that? The answer: It's airline logic. Air carriers have figured out a way to quadruple the price of a ticket depending on the time you bought it. So a ""walk-up"" fare purchased at the last minute can be hundreds, and even thousands, of dollars more expensive than an advance-purchase fare. But you're getting the same seat. You prepaid for your rental weeks in advance -- kind of like an advance-purchase ticket. But when you didn't show up as expected, the system reset your rate, charging you the more expensive ""walk-up"" rate. The computer problems should have been a showstopper. When a representative says the system is down, you need to get a receipt, even if it's handwritten. That way, if the company tries to double-dip, you can dispute the charge using the invoice as evidence that your bill was paid. Even if you have assurances that you won't be billed again, it's important to monitor your credit card. A car rental company isn't going to send you an e-mail letting you know that you're being charged more. It's just going to quietly take it off your credit card. As soon as you see a questionable charge on your card, mention it to the company or dispute it with your credit card company. I think you would have won a credit card dispute, by the way. You would have needed to show the prepaid voucher as proof that you had already paid for the rental, and the credit card company should have sided with you. I suggested you write a brief, polite e-mail to Alamo, asking it to reverse the charges. The response? A snippy note that said, ""Any changes to the basis of the reservation makes the rate subject to change,"" and adding, ""We are disappointed that this policy is a source of dissatisfaction for you."" Alamo denied your request. Like you, I was unhappy with the denials by phone and e-mail. So I contacted Alamo for you. It promptly refunded the $1,116 it should have never charged you in the first place. Christopher Elliott is the ombudsman for National Geographic Traveler magazine. E-mail him at celliott@ngs.org.

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously to pass a resolution extending the mandate of NATO-led military forces in Afghanistan for a year, hours after a deadly bombing near the Indian Embassy in Kabul. The bomb exploded in the center of Kabul on the corner of Passport Lane and the Indian Embassy. The suicide car bomb attack on Thursday left at least 17 people dead, most of them civilians, and 63 wounded. ""I think this is another reminder of the dangers that the Taliban pose to the Afghan population and to the international community in Afghanistan, and the importance of the continued international efforts there,"" said John Sawers, Britain's ambassador to the world body, after the resolution was passed. The council provides international legal approval for the deployment of NATO troops to assist in the protection of civilians in armed conflict. The resolution, however, did not address troop numbers, an issue that has generated controversy since the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, requested an additional 40,000 troops. The Security Council also condemned the attack, calling for the ""perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of this reprehensible act of terrorism"" to be brought to justice. In addition to extending the mandate, the resolution stressed the need to bolster Afghan security forces to help them become self-sufficient in protecting their country. Anders Fogh Rasmussen, NATO's new leader, recently announced that NATO forces would begin training Afghan police and increase training of the Afghan National Army. Some 90,000 international forces are deployed in Afghanistan, with 35,000 serving with NATO and 65,000 with the United States. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the Thursday bombing, saying an Afghan national in a sport utility vehicle carried out the attack. The bomber had intended to strike the embassy, Indian officials said.  Watch what a local shopkeeper says about the area » . ""The suicide attack(er) ... attempted (to go) through one of the embassy gates,"" Vishnu Prakash, spokesman for India's external affairs ministry, told CNN on Thursday. ""The embassy was the target."" The bomb went off about 8:30 a.m., just as offices and shops were opening for the day. The force of the blast shattered some of the embassy's windows, according to Prakash. The bombing came a year after a similar deadly attack outside the Indian Embassy. The Thursday attack killed 17 -- most of them civilians -- and 63 were wounded, Interior Ministry spokesman Ezmary Bashary said. The Taliban said the attack killed 35 people, including high-ranking Indian Embassy officials, as well as international and Afghan police officers. The blast damaged a security checkpoint outside the the embassy, said staffer J.P. Singh, but ""there were no casualties on the Indian side."" The embassy is in the center of Kabul, in a shop-lined street across from the Interior Ministry and several other government buildings. The explosion shattered car windows and toppled restaurant walls. Paramedics dug through twisted metal and debris, looking for survivors. A statement from President Hamid Karzai's office called the blast an obvious assault on civilians and said ""the perpetrators of this attack and those who planned it were vicious terrorists who killed innocent people for their malicious goals."" About a year ago, another suicide car bomb detonated outside the embassy. Among the 58 people killed in the July 7, 2008, attack were two Indian diplomats and 14 students at a nearby school. More than 100 were wounded in that blast. Afghan and Indian officials accused Pakistan's spy agency of involvement in that attack. Pakistan denied the accusation. India is the sixth largest donor to Afghanistan, providing millions of dollars to help with reconstruction efforts there.

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- An air traffic controller was joking with a woman about a dead cat just moments before a helicopter and small plane collided over the Hudson River in August, according to a recording released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration. The wreckage of a plane that collided with a helicopter is lifted on August 11 from the Hudson River. There were no survivors from the August 8 crash, in which three people died aboard the Piper Saratoga PA-32 fixed-wing plane that collided with a helicopter carrying six people, five of them Italian tourists. The FAA in August confirmed the air traffic controller at New Jersey's Teterboro airport, who initially handled the flight of the Piper before handing off to Newark controllers, had ""involved in apparently inappropriate conversations on the telephone at the time of the accident."" The controller and his supervisor, who was not in the building as required, were suspended. ""While we have no reason to believe at this time that these actions contributed to the accident, this kind of conduct is unacceptable, and we have placed the employees on administrative leave and have begun disciplinary proceedings,"" FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said at the time. The recording, released for the first time Thursday, caught the air traffic controller at Teterboro airport having a giggly chat with the woman, suggesting she grill the dead cat she apparently found. A source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN the woman was the controller's girlfriend. ""That thing was disgusting,"" she says, to which the controller responds, ""Chinese people do it, so why can't we?"" The exchange, which lasts about six minutes, is interrupted by a controller at the Newark airport, who asks the Teterboro controller for help with air traffic. ""Hey, Teterboro ... would you switch that guy, maybe put him on a two-twenty heading to get away from that other traffic please?"" the Newark controller is heard saying. The Teterboro controller seems to be juggling both conversations, telling to woman to ""hold on real quick"" while asking the Newark controller to repeat the request. ""Can you switch that (Piper) PA-32?"" the Newark controller said. Neither is able to communicate with the pilot of the Piper, with the Teterboro controller saying, ""He's lost in the hertz."" The conversation between the Teterboro controller and the woman continues as she mentions that it seems her friend is doing ""a lot of babysitting."" Seconds later, the crash occurs with no survivors. The National Transportation Safety Board has said that before the accident, Teterboro controller had switched control of the Piper plane to Newark tower, which the pilot never contacted. Raymond Adams, head of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, is representing the Teterboro controller. He declined to comment Thursday, except to say that ""the FAA has previously stated that the conversation had no connection to the crash."" The controller is still on paid administration leave pending further investing by the FAA, he added. The helicopter was taking the tourists on a 12-minute Liberty Helicopter Sightseeing Tour around New York, while the plane carrying three individuals was headed for Ocean City, New Jersey. Controllers lost contact with the plane at 11:53 a.m. as it flew at an altitude of about 1,100 feet. The FAA released the recording after a request from The Associated Press citing the Freedom of Information Act.","FAA reveals recording of air traffic controller just before fatal crash .

"(CNN) -- What green gadgets are worth splashing out for? Lucy Siegle, a British journalist specializing in ecological issues and trends, told CNN which eco gizmos get her seal of approval. Solar powered tents . Solar tent: A great green gadget for occasionaly campers. Siegle: I'm not big into camping but it's a massive thing here in the UK. During the summer barely a weekend goes by without a festival of some sort. The only thing however that gets me through the frequently rain-sodden experience is the ingenuity of a solar powered tent (I love them). Fit-PC2: Small is beautiful . Siegle: I'm acutely aware of the specter of e-waste because I make films about fly tipping in beautiful parts of Wales and come face to face with mounds of dumped monitors and keyboards. We have an issue in the UK with the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directive as there's a lot of crime -- see as evidence how a consignment of e-waste was found in Brazil recently. It's horrible. Anyway all this makes me technologically monogamous -- I keep my machine until the bitter end. However the bitter end is approaching for my Mac Book as half the keys have sprung off so I came across this. The Fit-PC 2.0 claiming to the world's smallest fully functioning PC and also the greenest. 115mm x 101mm x 27 mm. That's tiny! I love dematerialization of these objects. It should be sustainable design realized. If the makers are to be trusted, it uses 90 per cent less energy than a standard desktop PC. It uses less energy than a low energy light bulb. The main board is lead free.   View a gallery of the gadgets » . Dyson Animal hand-held vacuum cleaner . Siegle: I just got one of these, and have become quite the Stepford wife. Well, as far as crumbs are concerned - my house is a zero tolerance zone. Dyson is the most celebrated UK inventor, famous for the bagless vacuum cleaner. This offspring, the handheld, chargeable vac does some spectacular stuff. It 'spins dust and dirt out of the air' using a motor that spins ten times faster than the engine of a Boeing 747 courtesy of digital switching (subject to 15 patents). Another key factor is that this alternative motor does not cause those polluting carbon particles. All of this may sound rather energy hungry, but the new digital motor is 84 percent energy efficient. The reason I've listed it here is because it has huge potential in all sorts of applications and is a physical embodiment of Dyson's insistence that 'bigger motors don't always equal better performance'. Savaplug . Siegle: This is a retro inclusion (odd for a gadget list I know). I'm into the idea of Dynamic Demand -- regulating flow of power to our homes to even out and to make the grid more efficient (in the UK two thirds of power, mostly produced by coal fired power stations is lost before it gets to our homes). The Savaplug regulates flow on a microscale when you plug in an old style fridge. I don't need mine any more -- I have a new style, energy efficient fridge these days but keep it just in case I find someone who doesn't. Ikea Sunnan solar powered desk lamp . Lucy Siegle: Very simple, but actually very effective. I was sent this as a promotion. When you buy one, another is given free to kids in the developing world who have to study at night. A slightly mawkish, marketing stunt, but one that still appeals. I was amazed how it charged up in my kitchen, without me having to do anything. It was ready when my two year old nephew came to stay, fell out of his bed (I've subsequently got a bed guard for him) and needed the light on. The Sunnan has a warm, comforting glow. Riversimple hydrogen powered car . Lucy Siegle: I recently made a film about hydrogen fuel cells and how a British scientist, Dr Tom Bacon developed fuel cells for the Apollo 11 command center. Nixon (okay, not a president known for his probity) told Bacon that there would have been no mission without Bacon and his fuel cells. Anyway, it made me consider this technology more seriously. At Cranfield University (there are other partners too) they are perfecting a hydrogen fuel cell car. If it was funded like electric -- an easier option for the automotive industry -- it would have taken off by now (to pun from the Apollo connection). Hugo Spowers who is masterminding the project is an ethical visionary. He used to work in Formula One racing -- hardly known for its ethical outlook -- then did a Schumacher course at Dartington, famed for its deep green economics. He also has an MBA from Cranfield and is running this project as a shared commons program. Extraordinarily enlightened. The batteries are being recharged in China currently having been tested into submission, but when they come back I'm hoping for a test drive.","Eco journalist Lucy Siegle gives CNN her top practical green gadgets .

"(CNN) -- A Dolton, Illinois, police officer assigned to a school was placed on administrative leave and later resigned after a surveillance video surfaced of him allegedly assaulting a special-needs student, officials said. Videotape allegedly shows an unidentified police officer assaulting student Marshawn Pitts, 15. Ed Manzke, an attorney who represents the student, Marshawn Pitts, 15, told CNN Wednesday the officer beat Pitts for not adhering to the school's dress code. The incident occurred in May at the Academy for Learning, a Dolton high school for special-needs students. Pitts was admitted to the school in May after moving from Iowa, Manzke said. He suffered brain injuries as a child when he was hit by a car. The police officer, who has not been identified, reprimanded Pitts for not tucking in his shirt as school dress code and policy requires. A video, released to Pitts' parents by the school several weeks after the incident, showed Pitts talking to the officer and a faculty member grabbing Pitts' arm. Pitts pulls away and walks down the hall, with the officer and faculty member close behind. But the officer then slams him against the lockers and pins him on the floor -- breaking his nose, according to Manzke. Pitts was treated by a school nurse after the incident, then taken to the Dolton Police Department, where his mother picked him up, Manzke said. The officer was taken to a hospital and treated for an eye scratch, Manzke said. But, he said, the officer was never charged with anything and an explanation for the incident was never provided. In a written statement, Guy Lindsay, internal information officer for Dolton police, said the department was made aware of the incident and the tape on May 20. After review of the tape, the officer was removed from the school and placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation, Lindsay said. While on administrative leave, the police officer returned to the department and voluntarily resigned, Lindsay said. The investigation continues, he said. In a statement obtained by CNN affiliate WGN, the Academy for Learning said it could not comment on an incident involving a specific student. But, the school said, ""Unfortunately, the physical restraint of a student sometimes becomes necessary. In such instances, AFL and its staff are committed to employing techniques that are safe, effective and which conform to best practice standards. ""Annually, a Behavioral Intervention Committee comprised of administrators, staff, union representatives and parents convenes to review restraint procedures. The AFL Behavior Management Team also participates in professional development and training regarding physical restraint on an annual basis. After a physical restraint occurs, the team meets to process, debrief and evaluate the incident and use of a physical restraint. AFL addresses the unauthorized or inappropriate use of a physical restraint, or improper techniques, as necessary, as an internal manner."" Pitts' parents are considering litigation against the city of Dolton, the school and Dolton police, Manzke said. He added he is in talks with Dolton police to settle the case. If those talks are not fruitful, Manzke said, a lawsuit could be filed within a few weeks. Pitts is now living with his father and attending another school, Manzke said. CNN's Monica Trevino and Kara Devlin contributed to this report .","Officer beat student for not adhering to school's dress code, says student's lawyer .

"(CNN) -- Fabio Cannavaro is to join the Italian national squad on Sunday for their World Cup qualifier against Cyprus next week, despite being under the cloud of a drug test controversy. Fabioo Cannavaro's proudest moment came in 2006 when he led Italy to World Cup glory. It was revealed on Thursday that the 36-year-old Juventus defender recently failed a drug test after taking a medicine that contained the banned substance cortisone. Cannavaro was interviewed by the Italian Olympic Committee's (CONI) anti-doping prosecutor Ettore Torri on Thursday night in Turin but national coach Marcello Lippi does not expect his star to be absent from the squad. ""I have not spoken to Cannavaro,"" Lippi told reporters. ""Will he be here with us on Sunday? Of course he will. ""I have not spoken to Cannavaro,"" added national team doctor Enrico Castellacci. ""But he is calm and serene. This is just a bureaucratic case."" Juventus claimed the defender needed cortisone treatment for an insect sting in August. The player requested an exemption from taking drugs tests on the grounds of having taken a medication in an emergency situation but his request did not include a document necessary to complete the application. While awaiting a decision, Cannavaro took an anti-doping test after a Serie A game at Roma which returned a positive result. ""When he came to the national team, after the Roma game, he told us what had happened and he told us that without the medicine that contained cortisone he would have had a reaction, an anaphylactic shock,"" Castellacci said. ""We asked Juventus for all the necessary documents regarding the medicine taken by Cannavaro and all the communication is in our possession."" Cannavaro will not travel to Dublin for Saturday's World Cup qualifier against Ireland as he serves a one-match ban, but is expected to lead the Azzurri in Wednesday's qualifier against Cyprus in Parma.","Fabio Cannavaro is to join the Italian national squad on Sunday to face Cyprus .

"(CNN) -- Shortly after McDonald's celebrated its 30-year presence in France, the fast-food chain is conquering one of the country's most valued cultural institutions --the Louvre. McDonald's burgers and fries will be available under the glass pyramid of the Louvre. The restaurant will be serving its fast burgers in the Carrousel du Louvre, an underground shopping mall which lies under the main entrance of the museum and which still contains an ancient wall that was discovered during construction works.  McDonald's plans seem to have caused more media attention abroad than in France, but for some French outlets, the idea of combining fast food and ancient art is stomach churning. The Parisian Web site ""Louvre pour tous"" (Louvre for everyone) describes the company's plans to open a restaurant in the prestigious museum as ""bad taste"" and blamed the Louvre's directors for failing to prevent what could result in ""fragrances of fries drifting under Mona Lisa's nose"". Marion Benaiteau, spokeswoman for the museum, told CNN it was not their decision and declined to comment further on the issue. The Carrousel du Louvre mall is managed by Unibail-Rodamco, Europe's largest property company, and not the museum itself. The mall, which is situated next to the most visited museum in the world, counts 8.3 million visitors a year and enjoyed a total gross sales of $75 million in 2008. Le Parisien, a daily newspaper described the difference between McDonald's and the Louvre by comparing Ronald McDonald, the restaurant's clown character, to Venus de Milo, the famous ancient Greek statue of Aphrodite, which is on display at the Louvre. Should McDonald's be in the Louvre? Tell us what you think in the Soundoff box below.  McDonald's sees the opening of its new restaurant next to the home of Mona Lisa as nothing out of the ordinary. ""There are already many other restaurants in the mall, so we will only be one of the many restaurants that offer visitors their products."" said a spokeswoman for McDonald's in France, who declined to be named. ""There's even a Starbucks,"" she added. Museum lovers in France are shocked about the news, but not surprised, one told CNN. ""Museums have to offer services like restaurants and boutiques, it's completely normal,"" Jean-Michel Raingeard, President of the Federation of French Friends of Museums told CNN. What worries him, however, is the choice of shops. ""Museum directors seem to care more about the number of people they attract rather than the quality of people. Should a museum be a museum or an amusement park?"" asks Jean Michel Raingeard, who is also the European Vice President for The World Federation of Friends of Museums. Criticism, though fierce, has not halted the plans: construction work will start soon and the restaurant should be open ""by the end of the year,"" Mcdonald's said. The menu will also very likely stay the same. ""McDonald's functions the same way in all of France, so there will probably be no special menus,"" the spokeswoman said.","McDonald's to open restaurant in the mall of the world's most visited museum .

"(CNN) -- Switzerland's largest city has permitted the use of controversial posters which call for a ban on the construction of minarets on mosques in the European country. The Federal Commission against Racism said the posters defame Switzerland's peaceful Muslim population. The posters are part of a campaign by the nationalist Swiss People's Party (SVP) and feature a veiled woman against a background of a Swiss flag pierced by several minarets resembling missiles. The cities of Basel and Lausanne have described the posters as racist and banned them in publicly-owned spaces. However, Zurich is among a clutch of cities that have chosen not to prohibit them. According to the SVP, the minarets symbolize ideological opposition to the country's constitution. Switzerland will hold a national referendum on the issue on November 29. According to Agence France-Presse, an opinion poll by the daily Tages-Anzeiger showed more than 51 percent of Swiss voters are against any ban on minaret construction. The Swiss government and all the other major political parties are recommending a ""no"" vote, while local Christian, Jewish and Muslim leaders have joined forces to reject a ban, AFP added. The mayor of Zurich, Corine Mauch, told CNN that the decision on the poster was taken on the basis of political freedom of speech in the run-up to November's vote. ""While we disapprove of the posters we took the decision after legal consultations. ""We consulted the Federal Commission against Racism and spoke to Muslim communities in the city, but decided banning the posters from public spaces would draw more attention to the issue."" Do you agree with the Zurich decision? However, the Federal Commission against Racism said in a statement Wednesday that the posters ""defame Switzerland's peaceful Muslim population, feed prejudice, and portray the Muslim community as wanting to dominate Switzerland, oppress women and trample on fundamental rights."" The SVP have courted controversy with their campaigns in the past. In 2007 they faced international criticism for leading an anti-immigration campaign during the federal election that featured a poster with a white sheep kicking a black sheep off a Swiss flag. Under party leader Christoph Blocher they went on to win the biggest share of the vote in the 200-member parliament, taking 55 seats. Earlier this year they issued a poster depicting crows pecking at a map of Switzerland, as the country prepared to vote on whether to support an extension of a free movement of labor deal with the European Union which would include new members, Bulgaria and Romania.","Posters call for a ban on the construction of minarets on mosques .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A small, rural town in the hills of New Hampshire was jolted by a home invasion over the weekend that left a mother dead and her young daughter severely injured. Steven Spader, 17, is accused of using a machete to kill a woman and injure her daughter. ""This type of murder does not happen very often,"" New Hampshire Senior Assistant Attorney General Will Delker said. ""This is something out of the ordinary."" Four teenagers have been charged in connection with the incident early Sunday morning along an isolated dirt road in Mont Vernon, a town of about 2,000. In a news release Tuesday, the New Hampshire Department of Justice identified the victim as 42-year-old Kimberly Cates. The medical examiner determined that she died from ""multiple sharp injuries to the head, torso, left arm, and left leg."" The victim's 10-year-old daughter sustained serious knife injuries that required hours of surgery. ""She's still in the intensive care unit,"" Delker said. ""Her injuries weren't life-threatening, but you shouldn't minimize the severities of the injuries she suffered."" Delker said Kimberly Cates' husband was away on business at the time of the attack. Cates was a registered nurse at St. Joseph Hospital in Nashua, New Hampshire. ""She worked part time in our maternal and labor department and also in our emergency department,"" Sarah Ward, director of marketing and communications for the hospital, said Tuesday. ""The staff is pretty upset about it. They were pretty close to her."" ""The people up here aren't used to this kind of thing,"" Don Himsel, senior photo editor for the Nashua Telegraph, said Tuesday. ""This never really happens."" Himsel also said violent crime is extremely rare in Mont Vernon. ""I think we may have had one assault in town in the last 10 years."" The Mont Vernon Congregational Church opened its doors Wednesday for people who want to grieve, pray and meditate. ""This is a way to come together peacefully; that's what we are trying to do,"" church official Jane Nilles said Wednesday. ""The church understands that there are people hurting on both sides. This is a time to pray and ask for God's presence right now. It is a time to gather and to pray."" On Tuesday, the state Department of Justice announced the arrests of the four teenagers accused of taking part in the crimes. Steven Spader, 17, and Christopher Gribble, 19, were charged with first-degree murder, attempted murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. William Marks, 18, and Quinn Glover, 17, were charged with burglary, conspiracy to commit burglary and armed robbery. ""The allegations are that Spader wielded the machete and Gribble used the knife, and each of them struck the victims,"" Delker said. Delker, who described the case as being in its earliest stages, said prosecutors will evaluate whether additional charges will be brought or upgraded. ""Under New Hampshire law, anyone 17 and older is charged as an adult,"" Delker said. A probable cause hearing for the suspects will be held October 20.","Four teens charged in Sunday incident in Mont Vernon .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has ordered his government to take down concrete blast walls that line Baghdad's streets and surround whole neighborhoods, the Iraqi military announced Thursday. The walls split Baghdad along sectarian lines, shielding some from Shiite militias and Sunni insurgents. ""The concrete walls will be taken off from the main roads and side streets in all Baghdad areas, with no exceptions and within 40 days,"" a statement from Iraqi military's Baghdad Operations Command read. The massive concrete barriers, typically 3 meters (10 feet) tall, were quickly erected around many Baghdad buildings after the U.S. invasion in 2003. They mushroomed during the sectarian warfare that followed the 2006 bombing of a Shiite Muslim shrine in Samarra, when they were put up to separate Shiite and Sunni districts across Baghdad. While they split the city along sectarian lines, they also managed to protect neighborhood residents from Shiite militias and Sunni insurgents and helped U.S. troops and Iraqi government forces manage security within them. The order does not cover the Green Zone, which houses Iraqi government buildings and the U.S. Embassy, or military installations, government institutions, hotels or some private companies. The order came after meeting Wednesday with high-ranking security officials, according to the command. Iraqi forces are now calling the shots on issues related to security in their homeland since June 30, the date U.S. combat troops were mandated to leave Iraqi cities and towns pursuant to a joint security agreement.","Walls will be removed from main roads, side streets within 40 days, statement says .

""The Zombie Survival Guide: Recorded Attacks,"" the latest in the series of zombie chronicles by author Max Brooks, is a graphic novel that looks at the undead menace throughout history.

"SEATTLE, Washington (CNN) -- Who is stealing -- and crashing -- airplanes in Washington state? Police say they found this self-portrait of Colton Harris-Moore in the deleted file of a stolen digital camera. The 18-year-old man police call the prime suspect does not have a pilot's license. But he does have a nickname -- ""The Barefoot Burglar"" -- and a Facebook fan club, which compares him to Jesse James ""without the murders"" and exhorts: ""Fly, Colt, Fly."" Police say Colton ""Colt"" Harris-Moore has been linked to crimes in five counties involving planes, luxury cars and boats. He's known to alternate between squatting in vacant vacation homes, which he allegedly burglarizes, and roughing it in the woods. Since November, police say, at least three small, private planes have been stolen and flown away. The latest to go missing crash-landed last week in a clearing in Granite Falls, Washington, after running out of fuel, police said. The rough landing damaged the Cessna 182, which along with its instruments is worth more than $500,000. But authorities said the plane's pilot appears to have walked away unhurt. Harris-Moore has not been charged in any of the plane thefts. But authorities are testing vomit found in the cockpit of one plane to see whether they can place the teen inside. Harris-Moore has been on authorities' radar for years. ""Colt,"" as he is called, was first arrested for burglary at age 12, said Detective Ed Wallace, a spokesman for the Island County Sheriff's Office. The break-in at a local school earned Colton a few weeks in a juvenile facility, Wallace said. Local media reports tally nine arrests for Harris-Moore before the age of 15. Now police in five counties in Washington state are looking for him. Harris-Moore dropped out of high school and, according to Wallace, police believe he spent his teens burglarizing unoccupied homes on Camano Island, a vacation community of about 15,000 people off the Washington state coast. He became known as ""the Barefoot Burglar,"" because, investigators say, he preferred to prowl shoeless. Gradually, Wallace alleges, Harris-Moore moved onto more sophisticated crimes. ""He will typically break into a home or vehicle and copy down the credit card numbers,"" Wallace said. ""He then leaves the credit cards behind so people don't realize they have been stolen."" Wallace said Harris-Moore has charged thousands of dollars worth of video games, GPS devices and police scanners online, using stolen credit cards. When Harris-Moore wasn't squatting in homes, he took to the woods with survival gear to elude police. He's been known to hide in the trees. ""He's almost like a feral child,"" Wallace said. Harris-Moore's days of running from authorities on the 40-square-mile island appeared to end in 2007 when he was arrested and pleaded guilty to three counts of burglary. Wallace said some of the charges were dismissed as part of the guilty plea. Less than a year later, Wallace said,  Harris-Moore allegedly walked away from a juvenile halfway house. Police on Camano Island again began receiving reports of thefts that fit Harris-Moore's profile, Wallace said. In 2008, a deputy said he spotted Harris-Moore in a stolen Mercedes-Benz, but he lost the suspect when he allegedly dove from the moving vehicle. After the chase, police recovered a stolen digital camera from the car. Wallace said he found a deleted self-portrait of Harris-Moore, who posed in a shirt with a telltale Mercedes-Benz insignia. The shirt also belonged to the vehicle's owner. Harris-Moore faces 10 counts in that case, as well as other thefts, Internet crimes and burglaries, Wallace said. Charges are expected soon in a dozen more cases. Harris-Moore dropped from sight for a while when wanted posters of him went up around Camano Island. Soon, though, authorities in the San Juan Islands noticed a series of break-ins and wondered whether Harris-Moore was island-hopping. The theft of a Cessna 182 from the San Juan Islands in November jogged Wallace's memory. He recalled what he had found on a computer he said Harris-Moore used. ""He had looked at flight manuals and how to fly a plane,"" he said. Another theft of a small experimental plane had been reported in September. John Zerby, undersheriff of San Juan County, said police don't think the two thefts are a coincidence. ""This doesn't happen here, that's why we think they go together,"" he said. Police consider Harris-Moore to be a fugitive. Even though Harris-Moore has no known flight training, Zerby said police are certain he is their mystery pilot. Harris-Moore's mother doubts her son learned to fly on his own. ""Any time anything is stolen, they blame it on Colt,"" Pam Kohler told the Everett Herald newspaper. ""Let's say you're the smartest person in the world. Wouldn't you need a little bit of training in flying a plane? They're not easy."" CNN attempted to contact Kohler, but her phone was disconnected. CNN also tried to reach a former attorney for Harris-Moore but the lawyer has not returned calls requesting comment. Experts said that teaching oneself to fly is difficult but not impossible. ""It's been heard of,"" said flight instructor Devin Tolentino. ""Let's face it, the Wright brothers were able to teach themselves. Landing would be the hardest part, but if you weren't too concerned about using the plane again, it could be done."" Meanwhile, authorities in Whatcom County are investigating whether Harris-Moore stole a boat and used it to reach Point Roberts, where burglaries at three vacation homes have recently been reported, Deputy Jeff Roberts said.  Point Roberts, a small peninsula, is U.S. territory but is accessible only from the water or through Canada. From parts of Point Roberts, entering Canada is just a matter of crossing the street. Last week, law enforcement agencies got a new lead when a private plane was stolen in Bonner's Ferry, Idaho,  just across the border from Canada. Residents noticed a plane flying at an altitude of 100 feet as it left the area on Tuesday, said Detective Dave McClelland. The plane was found Thursday, crashed and out of fuel in a patch of cleared forest in Granite Falls, Washington. On Sunday, authorities say they received a report of a burglary. ""Blankets, shoes and food [were] taken instead of big-ticket items like TVs,"" said sheriff's spokeswoman Rebecca Hover. A gunshot rang out as deputies searched the woods and came across some of the stolen items, Hover said. No one was injured, but the SWAT team was called in. Police searched the area, using a helicopter with an infrared heat detection scanner and another Blackhawk helicopter provided by the Department of Homeland Security. Low-tech police work led to Harris-Moore's arrest in 2005. Police staked out his mother's house, waiting until someone inside ordered a pizza. Police rode in the delivery car to the house and waited for Harris-Moore to come to them.","Police believe Colton Harris-Moore may be stealing, crash-landing small planes .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- He's already served the time, but lawyers Thursday argued to clear his name as onetime U.S. Army Sgt. Michael Smith appeals a conviction for the torture of detainees once held at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. Abu Ghraib prison was taken over by the Iraqi government after claims of abuse by U.S. troops. Disturbing snapshots and video portraying sexual humiliation and physical intimidation against the detainees tarnished the image of the United States as it fought to stabilize Iraq after the American overthrow of Saddam Hussein. A military panel found Smith guilty in March 2006 on allegations that he used his military working dog to illegally ""terrorize and frighten"" detainees as part of interrogation techniques at the U.S.-managed facility in Baghdad. But his lawyer, U.S. Army Lt. Col. Jonathan Potter, told a military appeals court Thursday that the conviction was based on faulty instructions to the jury. ""Nowhere in this case did the government establish that the use of the dog was illegal,"" the defense counsel said, noting that Smith ""was not trained in interrogation techniques."" The military's prosecutor, U.S. Army Maj. Karen Borgerding, argued that Smith ""would know it's unlawful"" to use his unmuzzled dog to snarl within inches of a detained prisoner's face. Smith was originally sentenced to 179 days confinement and received a bad conduct discharge. Smith was not in the courtroom for the proceedings. Potter told CNN that he was not authorized to disclose his whereabouts but confirmed that his client remains on ""appeal release"" status after completing a three-month sentence. If the appeal fails, the discharge stands. If the appeals court overturns the conviction, Smith could return to the military and may receive back pay, pension and other benefits. The judges did not indicate when they may rule after each side presented oral arguments Thursday. At the 2006 court-martial, the jury found Smith guilty of charges that he used his military dog, Marco, to terrify prisoners, allegedly for amusement and in competition with other soldiers. Smith also was found guilty of an indecent act involving his dog. A female soldier testified on the first day of the court-martial that she had allowed Smith's dog to lick peanut butter she had placed on her bare chest as part of a dare from another soldier, who videotaped the stunt. ""It was foolish, stupid and juvenile,"" Smith said of the incident, reading from a statement. ""There's nothing I can do to take it back. If I could, I would."" Smith did not specifically express regret for the wrongdoing involving detainees.","Former Sgt. Michael Smith served three months on torture conviction .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- George Lucas didn't get to be a billionaire by delegating. George Lucas says he was ""completely surprised"" by ""Star Wars in Concert."" Holding fast to his vision -- and his marketing rights -- for the ""Star Wars"" empire has made it the biggest franchise in history, and made Lucas one of the most powerful people in entertainment. But while he's enthusiastic about the new touring show ""Star Wars In Concert,"" it wasn't his idea, and when I talked with him before the first Los Angeles performance this week, he kept giving the credit to others. ""Star Wars In Concert"" is built around John Williams' well-known scores from the films, performed by a symphony orchestra and choir, and accompanied by specially edited clips from all six movies, displayed on a mammoth LED screen. Anthony Daniels, who has played and voiced the golden protocol droid ""C3PO"" in every film and most of the spinoffs, provides live narration -- and another reason for the ""Star Wars"" fans in the audience, especially those waving lightsabers and dressed as everything from sand people to Imperial stormtroopers, to cheer mightily, as they did the night I interviewed Lucas. iReporter praises the 'Force' of the show . George Lucas: I've seen some presentations of, you know, live orchestras with ""Star Wars"" clips, and that sort of thing. But this is so much more than that -- it's so much more emotional, because what they've done is taken the emotional content of the score ... one is obviously the Imperial March, one is obviously romantic ... and then they've cut all the pictures around that from all the movies, so that you get this really wide range of visuals going with the music, and it really is quite powerful when you see the depictions of all of the various Imperial shenanigans that were going on over the Imperial March. CNN: Obviously, when John Williams did the music for the original film, neither of you could have guessed your association would last so long, or that you'd be so identified with each other. How did he get involved originally? Lucas: What I did was, I was doing this space opera, and I was talking to Steve Spielberg and I said, ""Look, I've got to get somebody who really knows the old-fashioned music score, I really am doing some giant romantic action adventure, you know, throwback to the '30s, and who do you know that can do that?"" And he said, ""Oh, there's only one person who can do that and that's John Williams -- he did 'Jaws' and he's perfect."" And I said OK, and I met him, and we hit it off, you know, perfectly, and doing the first film was such a great experience -- he's so wonderful to work with -- that, you know, I'll never let him go. And Steve won't let him go either! CNN: How did this show come together? Lucas: Howard! [Lucas calls over Howard Roffman, the president of Lucas Licensing.] You're the man who did the whole thing -- I've got nothing to do with it. ... We would kid him about how his concert was going and he had to get Johnny [Williams] to buy in and me to buy in. Howard Roffman: Well, he always got it from the beginning, so he was an easy sell. CNN: But what was it he ""got""? How did you sell him on a new concept for his franchise? Roffman: I think he understood that the music was so powerful and the images are so powerful that when you put that together with a live orchestra on a big venue, I mean, who would not be thrilled to see that? CNN: It's a very different experience, being live. Lucas: It's very powerful. I was completely surprised by it. And I've seen other live orchestra performances with ""Star Wars"" images, but nothing like this -- I mean this really works, because it was edited specifically to bring out the emotion.","""Star Wars in Concert' features John Williams' music and scenes from films .

"LONDON (CNN) -- Did President Obama land a Nobel peace prize at such an early stage of his presidency simply because he's not George W. Bush? A ""surprised and humbled"" Obama said he would accept the Nobel peace prize as a ""call to action."" Diplomatic circles are certainly not dismissing such a notion and a ""surprised and humbled"" Obama has himself agreed that the award (for which nominations had to be submitted only two weeks after his inauguration) can hardly have been a recognition of anything he has yet accomplished. It is a prize for aspiration rather than achievement. One of the best deliberate laughs Bush obtained in his last days in office came when he expressed himself pleased at the street reception during his attendance at a NATO summit in Romania. ""A lot of the crowd were waving... some of them with all five fingers,"" he said. Bush was acknowledging that many in Old Europe at least could not wait to say goodbye to a man whom they saw as a Cold Warrior at heart, the president who had led the world into a disastrous intervention in Iraq and a man heading a gas-guzzling nation who was not prepared to help the world cope with climate change. For many Europeans, the chief concern through the long, drawn-out race for the Democratic nomination and through the presidential election was that the result should give them anybody but Bush. Watch reaction in Europe to Obama's award . They were uneasy about his missile defense shield plans to base U.S. military installations in Poland and the Czech Republic. They felt he had never lived up to his pledge to work as hard on the Middle East peace process as Tony Blair had done on bringing peace to Northern Ireland. Especially they felt that the internment camp at Guantanamo Bay and the ""extraordinary rendition"" to countries where terror suspects might have been tortured was an affront to democracy which besmirched the reputation not only of the U.S. but of its allies, too. Europeans were alarmed that Bush seemed to be encouraging the climate change deniers. And although he became readier to listen to his European allies during his second term, they never really took to the man whose instinctive response was to use America's military might in the world's trouble spots rather than to stay at the negotiating table and who had little time for the United Nations. Couple that with the words in the Norwegian Nobel Committee's citation that the peace prize is being awarded to Obama ""for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and co-operation between peoples"" and that they have ""attached special importance to Obama's vision of and work for a world without nuclear weapons,"" and the message is clear. Unusually, this is a world statesman being rewarded not for what he has done but for representing a new beginning. As Mikhail Gorbachev was quick to point out, the Obama presidency is a big signal -- ""He has given hope."" By commenting approvingly that Obama has created a new climate in international politics, with emphasis on the role of diplomacy and of the United Nations, the Nobel Committee is clearly encouraging the new president, after just eight months in office, to continue with a style that Europeans find much more comfortable than that of Bush and the neo-conservatives. Those who worked with Bush are likely to feel aggrieved and to maintain that they, too, were working for the extension of democracy for which Obama is now being commended. As Europe digested the news of the prize, nobody wanted to go public with critical comment on a man who is still seen across Europe as a beacon of hope. But there were off-the-record mutters that this was all somewhat premature. Cool heads were noting that while intentions have been expressed, there has been no significant progress yet on the Middle East peace process. The proposed closedown of Guantanamo Bay has been announced but it has not happened. There are still large numbers of American troops in Iraq and the numbers in Afghanistan are likely to be increased. While Obama has spoken of his hope of agreeing with Russia on a reduction in the number of nuclear warheads, we are nowhere near to seeing an end to nuclear weapons, which are currently in the possession of the U.S., Russia, China, India, the United Kingdom, France, Pakistan and Israel. Obama may want the Senate to ratify the test-ban treaty but that has not happened yet and his moves on climate change, too, will require congressional compliance. The truth, say many continental commentators, is that Obama deserves a badge for effort -- an effort begun by scrapping the missile shield development in Poland and the Czech Republic -- but a peace prize is a step too far at such an early stage. He is being rewarded not for solid achievement but for creating new hope -- in effect, for not being Bush. It may well be, as President Sarkozy of France has declared, that the award ""confirms finally America's return to the hearts of the people of the world."" But some fear that America's conservatives will take it as a sign of weakness and become more obstructive to Obama's aims. Meanwhile, others are wondering: ""What on earth will they give him when he does have a real achievement to point to?""","Oakley: Obama's Nobel an award for aspiration rather than achievement .

"(CNN) -- Didier Drogba came off the bench to rescue a point for Ivory Coast as they drew 1-1 with Malawi on Saturday to book their place at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Didier Drogba scored for Ivory Coast as they drew 1-1 with Malawi to book their place at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Ivory Coast needed only a point from their match with the bottom-placed team in African qualifying Group E but found themselves a goal down in the 64th minute when Jacob Ngwira put the hosts ahead at the Kamuzu Stadium in Blantyre. Elephants coach Vahid Halilhodzic responded by throwing on Chelsea striker Drogba who was able to level the scores in the 67th minute. Malawi pushed for a winner as the second half wore on but were unable to add to the score and Ivory Coast secured the point they required for qualification. The result brought Ivory Coast's 100 percent run in the group to an end but ensured they will feature in the World Cup Finals for a second time following their debut appearance in 2006. Malawi also improved their chances of qualifying for the African Cup of Nations by moving third with four points, just behind Burkina Faso who have six and Guinea who are now last with three points. Elsewhere in the African qualifying zone Egypt recorded a 1-0 win over Zambia in their Group C clash in Konkola to potentially set up a deciding match with Algeria in Cairo next month. Egypt were on the back foot in the first half and were indebted to goalkeeper Essam El-Hadary who frustrated the Zambia fans with several fine saves as the visitors struggled to get to grips with the pitch at the Konkola Stadium. But the Pharaohs were a much-improved side after the half-time break and Hosny Abd-Rabou secured all three points with the only goal of the game in the 68th minute. Egypt defender Sayed Moawad laid off the ball for Abd-Rabou to fire a powerful right-footed shot past Zambia goalkeeper Kennedy Mweene and into the top corner of the net. The result means qualification will go right down to the wire even if Algeria take maximum points from their clash with bottom side Rwanda on Sunday and go three points clear of Egypt at the top of the group. Cameroon moved a step closer to qualification as they remained top of Group A with an emphatic 3-0 victory over Togo in Yaounde. The Indomitable Lions took the lead in the 32nd minute through Newcastle midfielder Geremi when he smashed home the rebound after Togo goalkeeper Kodjovi Obilale had saved his initial shot from the penalty spot. Lyon's Jean Makoun doubled the advantage two minutes after the interval after he tapped home following a mazy dribble by Samuel Eto'o and Achille Emana made the points safe in the 52nd minute with a low drive. Gabon remain a point behind Cameroon after they clinched a 3-1 win over Morocco in Libreville having taken the lead after Hicham Mahdoufi put through his own net moments before half-time. Eric Mouloungou and Daniel Cousin gave Gabon a three-goal lead before Adel Taarabt pulled one back for Morocco with a late consolation. Paul Le Guen's Cameroon side, who had looked doubtful to qualify when he took over, are in pole position at the top of the group with 10 points ahead of Gabon on nine, Togo on five and Morocco with three.","Striker Didier Drogba scored as Ivory Coast drew 1-1 with Malawi in Blantyre .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Atlanta rapper DeAndre Cortez Way, better known by his stage name Soulja Boy Tell 'Em or just Soulja Boy, was charged with obstruction after running from police despite an order to stop, a police spokesman said Friday. Rapper Soulja Boy was arrested in Georgia after allegedly running from police. The 19-year-old singer was among a large group that had gathered at a home in Stockbridge, 20 miles south of Atlanta, said Henry County, Georgia, police Capt. Jason Bolton. Way was arrested Wednesday night along with another man, Bolton said. Police said Way left jail Thursday after posting a $550 bond. Bolton said officers responded to a complaint about a group of youths milling around the house, which appeared to be abandoned. When police arrived, they saw about 40 people. Half of them ran away, including Way, Bolton said. The ones who remained told officers they were at the home to film a video. Way was arrested when he returned to the house to get his car, Bolton said. He said the house was dark inside and looked abandoned. ""He just ran from the police, and then he decided to come back,"" according to Bolton. The second man who returned for his vehicle was arrested after police found eight $100 counterfeit bills inside, according to the officer. Way broke into the music scene two years ago with his hit ""Crank That (Soulja Boy).""

"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- Iran's trial of more than 100 people who it has linked to post-election unrest is a ""sign of weakness"" and shows that the Islamic republic ""is afraid of its own people,"" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told CNN Thursday. Iran is ""afraid of the truth and the facts coming out,"" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said. ""It is a show trial, there's no doubt about it,"" Clinton told CNN's Fareed Zakaria in a wide-ranging interview to be broadcast on his ""GPS"" program Sunday. ""It demonstrates I think better than any of us could ever say that this Iranian leadership is afraid of their own people, and afraid of the truth and the facts coming out."" Clinton spoke to Zakaria during her visit to Africa. Those on trial include Newsweek reporter Maziar Bahari, who has dual citizenship in Iran and Canada, and Kian Tajbakhsh, an Iranian-American scholar. The trial, which began over the weekend, is scheduled to resume Saturday, according to Iran's semi-official Fars News Agency. This week, the State Department issued a statement expressing deep concern for Tajbakhsh. ""Given that the charges facing Mr. Tajbakhsh are without foundation, we call on Iran's leadership to release Mr. Tajbakhsh without delay,"" State Department spokesman Robert Wood said Tuesday, reading a prepared statement. ""He has played absolutely no role in the election and poses no threat to the Iranian government or its national security."" Wood said Tajbakhsh has not been provided an attorney, which he is entitled to, and warned Iran that ""the world is watching what is happening in Iran and will bear witness."" Speaking on Thursday, Clinton said the United States also has ""expressed our concern about Mr. Bahari's confinement and trial"" to Canada's government, and offered its help. All of those on trial in Iran -- who include Iranian journalists and supporters of the opposition -- have been charged for their alleged roles in protests that followed last month's disputed presidential election. The June 12 election gave President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad a second term in office, but it also sparked a massive opposition movement that has regularly protested against the Iranian leadership and has shaken the foundation of Iran's Islamic theocracy. Those on trial will be placed into three categories, according to Fars: the ""plotters, intriguers, and planners of the riots""; ""the antagonists and those affiliated to foreign services""; and ""the opportunists, hooligans, and hoodlums who set ablaze, or destroyed private and public properties, and those that have had hands in disturbing public security.""","""It is a show trial, there's no doubt about it,"" Clinton told CNN's Fareed Zakaria .

"VERACRUZ, Mexico (CNN) -- The dead always tell a story. And in Mexico that story is the fight for the right to meet U.S. demand for illegal drugs -- a war becoming more violent and ruthless, mostly because of one group. Suspected members of Los Zetas drug cartel are presented to reporters in Mexico City in April. Its name is Los Zetas. Imagine a band of U.S. Green Berets going rogue and offering their services and firepower to drug cartels. That's what happened in Mexico in the 1990s. Commandos from the Mexican army deserted and set up a cartel, known as Los Zetas. The U.S. government says Los Zetas is ""the most technologically advanced, sophisticated and dangerous cartel operating in Mexico."" Los Zetas are blamed for last week's brutal killings of the police chief in the southern Mexican city of Veracruz, his wife and four children. The way in which the killers carried out their crime sent a message. At 5 a.m. on July 29, two cars pulled up in front of the police chief's house, and eight or nine gunmen got out, armed with assault rifles and 40 mm grenade launchers. They blasted their way into the house, and it took them less than five minutes to execute Jesus Antonio Romero, his wife, also a police officer, and their son. The gunmen then set the house on fire, killing the remaining three children, all girls.  Watch scenes of the escalating drug war in Veracruz » . With their fierce weaponry and military expertise, Los Zetas are considered the most formidable enemy in the drug war. ""The Zetas have obviously assumed the role of being the No. 1 organization responsible for the majority of the homicides, the narcotic-related homicides, the beheadings, the kidnappings, the extortions that take place in Mexico,"" said Ralph Reyes, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency's chief for Mexico and Central America. The fight against Los Zetas will take years, Reyes said. ""They continue to train new recruits through several campaigns. One of them is the very open and public narco banners that they post around the country of Mexico, specifically tailored to the military and [saying] that they will offer better pay and better benefits if they join the ranks of the Zetas,"" Reyes said from his Washington office, where he directs the U.S. battle against Los Zetas. With its mastery of combat, Reyes said, the organized crime network operates more like a U.S. infantry company patrolling the streets of Falluja, Iraq, than a street gang. Newspapers in Veracruz have headlines almost every day about drug cartels' bloody violence, more often than not linked to Los Zetas. The DEA said that although the group originally was based on military lines, the cartel has been built into a business structure, with quarterly meetings, business ledgers, even votes on key assassinations. And now Los Zetas are taxing businesses beyond their drug reach -- from human trafficking across the U.S. border to, as one recent scandal showed, imposing a kind of tax on the Mexican government. The state oil company has been bleeding billions to corrupt officials linked to Los Zetas. And, as a DEA agent recently said, the American border makes no difference to Los Zetas. It doesn't matter if violence is perpetrated on the Mexican or U.S. side of the border. Inside the United States, one of the instruments of assassination Los Zetas unleashed was teenager Rosalio Reta. Given six months of military training in Mexico, he was sent across the border to target rival drug gangs. He was 13 years old when he committed his first killing. ""I loved doing it,"" Reta says in a police interrogation tape. ""Killing that first person, I loved it. I thought I was Superman."" U.S. officials have said there are many more like him.","U.S. labels Los Zetas as Mexico's most ""sophisticated and dangerous cartel""

"Editor's note: John Feehery worked for former House Speaker Dennis Hastert and other Republicans in Congress. He is president of Feehery Group, a Washington-based advocacy firm that has represented clients that include News Corp., Ford Motor Co. and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He formerly was a government relations executive vice president for the Motion Picture Association of America. John Feehery says he's proud Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize, but now the president needs to earn it. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Usually, when a president wins the Nobel Peace Prize, it is uniformly seen as a positive development for America and for the world. Both opponents and allies tend to celebrate the fact that an American president actually got recognized by a bunch of Norwegians for something he achieved. But with Barack Obama, who surprisingly picked up his first Nobel Prize on Friday, the reaction was not altogether positive from either the left or the right. You would expect that conservatives would raise questions about the president's award. Conservatives raise questions about everything the president does. But liberals also joined in. Mickey Kaus of Slate said that the president should say thanks, but no thanks. ""Turn it down! Politely decline. Say he's honored but he hasn't had the time yet to accomplish what he wants to accomplish."" Liberal columnist Richard Cohen wrote a mocking column, comparing Obama's award to a fictional award given to Sarah Palin for promising to ""read a book someday."" We are all glad that Norway loves Obama, but come on. Let's get serious. I am reminded of when Chicago White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf decided to retire the jersey of longtime White Sox player Harold Baines. It was a little premature for Baines to get his uniform retired when he himself was playing for another team. (Baines played a couple more years, surely the only instance where a player's uniform was retired before the player was.) Awarding Obama the Nobel Peace Prize is similarly premature. In fact, the White House seemed as surprised as anybody about the gesture. I imagine that when Obama first picked up the line, he thought it was a crank call. ""I won what?"" he must have exclaimed. But it is no joke. It seems that President Obama won his first Nobel Peace Prize, for, well, being President Obama. Just the very idea of a President Obama is enough to make the Nobel Selection Committee swoon. The president said he was humbled by this award. To paraphrase Winston Churchill, he has much to be humble about. When it comes to peace, it is hard to see what notable accomplishments have been achieved thus far in the Obama presidency. That is not a slap at him. Peace takes time. It took John Hume and David Trimble about 30 years of really hard and dangerous work in Northern Ireland before they got a Nobel Peace Prize. And despite all of that hard work, peace and reconciliation is still elusive in that region. Mr. Obama hasn't even been able to get a peace deal between Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, who continue to snipe at each other over the health care public option and Afghanistan. Peace hasn't exactly broken out in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Israel, or Iran either. Nobel Prizes usually go for some fairly notable accomplishments. Nelson Mandela spent much of his life protesting apartheid and serving a prison sentence. He is a man who deserved a peace prize. Mikhail Gorbachev allowed the Soviet Union to collapse without much of a whimper. That was an accomplishment that deserved a peace prize. But what exactly has President Obama done to deserve such an award? And if he actually does something in the future, does that mean he gets another one? Apparently, the voting on the peace prize started shortly after the president was sworn in. Perhaps he is getting the peace prize because of his inaugural address. Yep, a lot of people came to that speech, and peace mostly reigned on that day (except for those people with tickets to the Inauguration who got stuck in the ""purple tunnel"" in Washington). But I don't think he deserves a peace prize for that. I guess he got the prize because he was elected president and he wasn't George Bush. Well, if that is the case, maybe all of those millions of Americans who voted for him should share the prize, because they actually did most of the work. They voted. As an American, I am proud that our president was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize. Now, I, like many others on the right and the left, would like to see him do something to earn it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Feehery.","John Feehery: Obama's Nobel Prize win surprised the right, the left, Obama himself .

"(CNN) -- The new horror movie ""Paranormal Activity"" could be filling movie studio marketing departments with fear. ""Paranormal Activity"" tells the story of a couple determined to discover if their house is haunted. Using a campaign of limited showings, social media and word-of-mouth fan buzz, the film has managed to become a breakout hit without the aid of a glitzy marketing campaign -- or even a traditional movie trailer. According to Variety, the very low-budget film (it reportedly cost $11,000), which played in fewer than 200 theaters, raked in $7.1 million over the weekend -- a record for a limited-release film. The film had an impressive $44,163 per-screen average and placement in the top five of the box office ratings over the weekend. ""We think it's exciting that they are taking this grassroots approach to independent film because sometimes independent films do get lost in the shuffle,"" said Kevin Carr, a writer/reviewer for the site Film School Rejects. ""It's a unique test to see if people can demand things outside of standard marketing campaigns."" ""Paranormal Activity"" bills itself as ""the first-ever major film release demanded by you."" The movie, which was an audience favorite at the alternative Slamdance festival in early 2008, was acquired by Dreamworks (then a part of Paramount Pictures) two years ago. The studio initially planned to remake it using better-known actors. But after studio executives, including Steven Spielberg, viewed it, they decided the film could stand more or less as it was (though director Oren Peli did shorten the film and shoot a new ending). The movie gained buzz after Paramount began late-night screenings in college towns, and fans took to Twitter and other sites to hail the scary flick, which centers on a young couple who believe their house may be haunted. Paramount increased the interest by urging fans to sign on to ParanormalMovie.com and demand theaters in their locations show the film. Peli posted a video on YouTube expressing gratitude to the fans and urging them to continue rooting for the movie. ""I just wanted to take this opportunity to speak directly to the fans and thank you all for the amazing support,"" Peli said on the video. ""It's just been overwhelming especially considering the long road this film had for three years and the studio wanting to do a remake."" More than a million people have heeded the call. The result has been a groundswell of interest rivaling that of big-budget films. Megan Colligan, co-president of marketing for Paramount, said the studio had a limited budget for advertising the film, so its marketing had to be tightly targeted. Moreover, condensing its atmosphere into a 30-second TV spot was a challenge, so executives opted to produce a trailer showing fans waiting in line for the movie and their reaction to the film, said Josh Greenstein, who also serves as co-president of marketing for Paramount. ""It was very important that we sold this as an experience and rather than just a movie,"" he said. ""When people saw the movie they loved it so much and there is such a slow build of terror that you have to sit through to experience the full effect of the movie, so we changed the marketing techniques in advertising and online to make it more experiential."" The unique marketing campaign appears to have paid off. ""The fans have really made this their film and they are doing the bulk of the work [to market the film],"" Colligan said. ""The film is selling itself,"" Greenstein added. Critics have also taken notice, and have showered the film with good reviews. In giving the movie an A-minus grade, Entertainment Weekly film critic Owen Gleiberman wrote ""With its this-is-really-happening vibe, 'Paranormal Activity' scrapes away 30 years of encrusted nightmare clichés. The fear is real, all right, because the fear is really in you."" Overall, the film has earned a strong 85 percent approval rating at review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. Moviegoers agree. Rajiim Gross, an iReporter who posted a review of the film, said he found ""Paranormal Activity"" to be much better than ""Blair Witch Project,"" another indie-horror film to which it is being compared. Check out Rajiim Gross' iReport . ""It actually scared the hell out of me,"" Gross said. ""I saw it during the day and I would hate to be someone who went home after seeing it late at night."" Gross said he believed the studio was smart to leverage the Internet to spread the word.  Watch Rajiim Gross' review of 'Paranormal Activity' » . ""The best advertising is word of mouth,"" Gross said. ""People tell 10 friends, they go see it and they tell 10 more friends and soon you have an entire community who wants to see it."" Carr, whose Film School Rejects site has been following the frenzy, said the movie ""gets inside of your head"" and benefits from the traditional fan support that horror films often enjoy. That, coupled with the big cinema thrills and chills, should add up to continued box office success, Carr said. ""Watching it with 250 strangers in a movie theater and getting everybody to jump at the same time definitely has an effect,"" he said. ""It's the event film right now of the year, which is something that needs to be experienced.""","New horror film has found success with fans spreading the word .

"(CNN)  -- The assault began at dawn, as bullets and rockets peppered the remote outpost in eastern Afghanistan. Lt. Cason Shrode said that in less than two minutes, his team's generator was hit and they were out of power. The insurgency was so fierce, according to one soldier, that the troops couldn't get to their mortars to fire back. ""They were under heavy enemy contact,"" Sgt. Jayson Souter said, describing the October 3 attack that pinned his comrades at Combat Outpost Keating, a remote base in Nuristan province. Four servicemen -- Souter, a fellow soldier, an Apache helicopter pilot, and a gunner -- talked to a military reporter about their roles during the Keating attack in an interview posted by the Department of Defense on Facebook and NATO's International Security Assistance Force YouTube Channel. The United States says about 200 insurgents -- mostly local fighters, with some Taliban organizers and leaders -- had been planning the attack for days, hiding mortars, rockets and heavy machine guns in the mountains.  Watch more about their story » . The battle started early on October 3 and lasted for 12 hours. At the end, eight American soldiers and more than 100 militants were killed and buildings at the outpost were destroyed. Fire support officer 1st Lt. Cason Shrode said the initial round ""didn't seem like anything out of the ordinary."" There was a lull and then there was a heavy attack. ""We started receiving a heavy volley of fire. Probably 90 seconds into the fight they ended up hitting one of our generators so we lost all power,"" Shrode said in the interview posted online by the Defense Department. ""At that point I knew that this was something bigger than normal."" Troops called in air support. Helicopter gunner Chad Bardwell said he had to confirm the fighters he saw on ridgelines were the enemy because he had never seen such a large group of insurgents. ""We tried to stop them as they were coming down the hill. ... We were taking fire pretty much the entire day,"" he said in the Defense Department interview. Chief Warrant Officer Ross Lewallen, the Apache pilot, said a few aircraft were damaged in what was a ""time-consuming endeavor"" governed by tough terrain. He said the morning battle was ""significant,"" but later troops were able to identify targets and eliminate larger weapons. ""One of the primary reasons for the fight taking so long is that it is an extreme terrain,"" he said in the same interview. Lewallen said the valley sits beneath mountains to the west and north. ""There's a lot of cover so you really can't detect the enemy until they start moving again,"" he said, adding that it was tough for medical evacuation aircraft to land ""because we were still trying to control"" the outpost. The intense assault on Keating led to fires. There were five main buildings at the post and four of them burned. Soldiers eventually ended up going into one building. ""The next morning it was pretty much ash besides that one building. I mean that's the way to describe it. Most of it had burned down. So we were pretty much at one building and the rest was just a shadow of what it used to be,"" Shrode said in the Defense Department interview. Lewallen said what came together was ""air-ground integration."" ""All the training we've done before deploying here; it really clicked that day,"" he said in the interview. ""We started realizing that the guys on the ground knew what they needed to tell us to get the job done. It made things that much easier."" He disputed media reports suggesting that there weren't enough weapons and troops. He said 40 minutes into the fight, air power arrived. ""We had everything we needed. It was just a big attack with a lot of people. Bad things happen -- but I think we did well, under the circumstances."" Reflecting on the fight, Souter said, ""Everybody basically came together and in the mix of it all, they were donating blood for the wounded that we had. They all pulled together to make sure that we can pull our boys out of this.""","Soldiers describe October 3 attack at a remote base in Nuristan province .

"(CNN) -- Percy von Lipinski figures he flies about 100,000 miles a year. He knows he's going to see a healthy share of flight delays regardless of where he goes. A new study says delays will continue to frustrate fliers like this man at Washington's Dulles International Airport. But he especially anticipates them at the larger airports, such as Chicago's O'Hare International -- ""You can't possibly put that many planes there and not have a delay,"" he said -- and New York's John F. Kennedy International. So when he has a choice between two connecting cities, he said he'll generally choose the smaller one. Delays at the larger airports, he said, are compounded by other hassles such as longer distances between terminals. ""There's wear and tear on your travel psyche -- which bus you need, which terminal you should be at,"" said von Lipinski, a 54-year-old Vancouver, British Columbia, resident who owns businesses around the globe. ""By the time you get to your destination, you're bound to come up frazzled."" Delays contribute to that frustration, and there may be more of it to go around these days. Though the percentage of delayed U.S. flights has dipped recently because fewer planes are flying during the recession, there's been a 20-year trend of increasing delays, and the increases should continue once economic growth returns, a study released Thursday by the Brookings Institution said. The average length of U.S. flight delays rose from 40.9 minutes in 1990 to 56.5 minutes in June 2009, according to the study, ""Expect Delays: An Analysis of Air Travel Trends in the United States."" It also found that among delayed flights, the share of those that landed at least two hours late more than doubled from 4.3 percent in 1990 to 10.1 percent in May 2009. And in a 12-month period ending in June 2009, the majority of delays was concentrated in 26 metropolitan areas, or hub cities, the study said. Of these 26 hub cities, six had worse-than-average, on-time percentages for both arrivals and departures: New York; Chicago, Illinois; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Miami, Florida; Atlanta, Georgia; and San Francisco, California. The nationwide on-time arrival rate was 78.9 percent, and the departure rate was similar, study co-author Robert Puentes said. New York's on-time arrival rate, 66.3 percent, was worst in the nation, said the study, which analyzed air travel between metro areas rather than airports. Delays are going to get worse, study co-author Adie Tomer said. ""On-time performance has improved recently because the number of people flying is at its lowest point since 9/11, but as the economy bounces back, air passenger levels will grow, and on-time performance will likely resume its decline."" The hub cities that did better than the national average for both arrivals and departures were Salt Lake City, Utah; Phoenix, Arizona; Detroit, Michigan; and Washington. The study said on-time performance generally decreases as air travel increases. In 1990, with more than 400,000 domestic passengers nationwide, the country's on-time flight percentage was just under 80 percent. In 2007, with nearly 700,000 domestic passengers, the on-time rate was around 74 percent. The authors recommend Congress and other authorities use the findings to help decide where to invest in high-speed rail projects and other measures to ease airport congestion. Michael Boyd, president of Colorado aviation consulting firm Boyd International Group, is critical of the recommendation, saying the country could handle the current flight demand -- and cut delays -- by improving its air traffic control system. The old system, he said, is outdated, doesn't use all of the sky and directs planes to fly farther and longer than they need to. ""Instead of saying, 'Let's get a system that can handle the traffic,' Brookings wants to lessen the demand. That's a caveman mentality,"" Boyd said. Deron Lovaas, transportation policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the study ""hit the nail on the head in terms of the opportunity"" to promote alternative modes of transportation. ""The planes waste a lot of fuel idling on the tarmac and during takeoff and landing cycles of flight. So the lowest-hanging fruit available for reducing emissions -- beyond changing plane designs and changing the fuel mix in planes -- is to reduce congestion at airports and to go after short haul flights, where a greater percentage of the flight is made up of takeoff and landing cycles, where most of the emissions are,"" Lovaas said. Airplane passengers can take steps to cushion the impact of a delay or lower the chance of getting on a delayed flight, Boyd said. Passengers should only choose connection flights that depart at least an hour after their first plane's scheduled landing, he said. Also, he said, people who book a flight just a day or two in advance should look at weather forecasts. ""If there's bad weather in Chicago, don't go through Chicago"" if you don't have to, Boyd said. Von Lipinski's recommendation, besides trying to avoid busier airports, is to treat airline workers with respect. ""The agents have a lot of discretion, and they're human beings. If you treat them like dirt and are screaming [because of a delay], you know what the result is going to be,"" he said. ""If you [treat them well], you'll probably find they'll be willing to help you."" CNN's Jim Kavanagh contributed to this report.","Major hub cities are bottleneck for air traffic, Brookings Institution study says .

His online Nonverbal Dictionary is used around the world as a reference tool. Barack and Michelle Obama celebrate winning the Democratic nomination with a fist bump in 2008. SPOKANE, Washington (CNN) -- The H1N1 swine flu virus is putting our most familiar gesture of greeting -- handshakes -- at risk. As an anthropologist who watches people for a living, I can tell you that human beings touch their own faces with their own fingertips hundreds, if not thousands of times a day. Repeated face touching -- especially finger contact with eyelids, lips, and nostrils -- is as predictable as blinking. You'll observe hand-to-face gestures in every culture and society, as well as in our closest primate relatives, the monkeys and apes. There's nothing wrong with face touching. Nothing, that is, unless you're afraid of germs. And today, many of us around the world are terrified by these tiny organisms, especially ones that cause swine flu. Merely by shaking the hand of someone infected by the swine-flu virus, we risk infection each time we inadvertently reach up and touch our faces. Physicians urge that we wash right after shaking hands. But since the anthropologist in me knows that, as a primate, you'll touch your face before washing, germs will inevitably visit unsuspecting lids, lip, and noses. The human handshake itself, meanwhile, is a widespread gesture used for meeting, greeting, and sealing a deal. It's a ritualized gripping of another's hand, with one or more up-and-down (or, in Texas, sideways) motions followed by a quick release. Since the fingertips and palm of the hand are exquisitely sensitive, the shake itself can be deeply personal. We instantly feel the warmth or coolness, dryness or moistness, and firmness or weakness of another's grip. Sensory input from a hand's thermal and pressure receptors to the brain's sensory cortex and then to deeper, emotional brain areas can be intense. If you travel to France, be prepared to shake hands dozens of times a day. Office workers in Paris, for example, may shake in the morning to greet, and in the afternoon to say goodbye, to colleagues. Outside vendors and technicians will handshake with everyone present when they enter or leave an office. The risk of hand-carried flu virus is thus greater here than it is in the United States, where handshaking is far less frequent. Contrast this to the Japanese practice of giving fewer handshakes, still, in favor of polite bows of the head. In all three nations, casual face touching is frequent, but germs in Tokyo are less apt to spread through handshakes. In Islamic nations, it is strictly taboo for men to shake hands in public with women. So, Muslim couples are less likely to exchange swine-flu germs through manual contact than are business men and women in, say, Seattle, Washington. Since in much of the world a handshake is both a visual and a tactile index of your concern for other people, it's hard to hold one back. In North America, Latin America, and Europe, when someone holds out a hand, it's difficult not to just take a step forward and shake. You don't want, after all, to seem rude. In Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East, handshaking may be more nuanced than in the West, or even absent. An Asian namasté, with your palms and fingers pressed together in front of your chest, given with a slight bow -- or a Muslim salaam, in which your right hand touches your forehead, also given with a slight bow, may be proffered instead of a handshake. While you'll see the same incidence of facial touching -- to wipe a lip, relieve tension, or scratch an itch -- the fingertips themselves won't carry germs born of handshakes. So, what are we face-touchers in the rest of the world to do? Are we doomed to spread flu germs through our practice of ritually of gripping each other's hands? The short answer is no. Thanks to a pair of the planet's most well known human primates, we now have a healthier hand sign with which to meet and greet. Since the Obama-Lama ""fist bumps"" have been so well publicized of late, I'm sure you've seen it in newspapers and magazines and on Web sites and TV. Primates are the most imitative of all of Earth's animals, so don't be surprised if you find yourself bumping fists -- a lot -- in the weeks and months ahead. On September 22, 2009, the Dalai Lama was welcomed to Memphis, Tennessee, not with a handshake but with a fist bump from interim Memphis Mayor Myron Lowery. The exiled Tibetan spiritual leader balled up his fist and reached it forward to make friendly contact with the mayor's own proffered balled-up fist. From his smiling face, I could tell the Dalai Lama enjoyed his new greeting ritual. It looked as if he were playing with the cue. Though it was unclear if either of the fist-bumpers had flu phobia, that they touched with the knuckles instead of the fingertips rendered disease transmission far less likely. A year earlier, on June 3, 2008, then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama tenderly fist bumped with his wife Michelle, in what The Washington Post called ""the fist bump heard 'round the world."" That a U.S. president publicly performed the fist bump -- a gesture that originated partly from the sportsman's palm high-slap of victory and partly from the Black Power fist of the 1970s -- has given the gesture staying power, even though some people were critical of its use. It will last considerably longer than Andy Warhol's ""15 minutes of fame."" Thanks to Barack Obama, the Dalai Lama, and the swine flu, the fist bump will surely show up at a greeting near you.

Helen Suzman, pictured at her Johannesburg home in November 2007. Suzman, a constant thorn in the side of South Africa's apartheid governments, was one of the leading white opponents of the segregationist regime and the only opposition lawmaker for 13 of the 36 years she served in parliament. She was particularly instrumental in exposing the indignities of the pass laws, which curtailed the movement of black South Africans. The Nelson Mandela Foundation, in a statement Thursday, called Suzman ""a great patriot and a fearless fighter against apartheid."" Send your tributes to Helen Suzman. The African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party in South Africa, also paid tribute, saying: ""As a member of parliament and a vocal critic against apartheid, the ANC remembers and respects the contribution of Suzman towards the demise of apartheid.""

"(CNN)  -- The Public Utility Commission of Texas will review the case of a cancer patient fighting to keep her electricity on to power her oxygen machine, the commission told CNN on Wednesday. Mable Randon, who has stage 4 cancer, was denied help paying for electricity, which she needs to power her oxygen tank. CNN affiliate KHOU of Houston, Texas, said calls poured in from as far away as Connecticut after the station aired its story on Mable Randon, a stage 4 cancer patient who received a cutoff notice after she fell behind on her bills. ""I'm on a set income,"" she told KHOU. ""My husband lost his job. He finds a little work every now and then, but it's hard."" She applied to CenterPoint Energy's Critical Care Program which helps maintain service for people who depend on electric-powered life support systems, but she was rejected. ""I'm fighting for my life, and I thought people at the power company would help me,"" said Randon, who uses a wheelchair. ""I just thought they'd make some kind of exception for me."" Randon's power will stay on until the commission examines the facts in the case, said Terry Hadley, spokesman for the commission. CenterPoint told Randon she failed to meet the criteria. Spokeswoman Alicia Dixon told KHOU that Randon could have bought a battery-powered oxygen machine.

"(CNN) -- California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has signed a bill commemorating Harvey Milk, the first openly gay politician elected to public office in the state, a spokesman for the governor said Monday. Stuart Milk, nephew of Harvey Milk, sits next to a photo of the gay rights activist in March. ""He really saw this signing as a way to honor the gay community in California,"" spokesman Aaron McLear told CNN in a telephone interview. Schwarzenegger vetoed a similar bill last year, saying he believed Milk should be recognized at the local level. But since then, ""Milk has become much more of a symbol of the gay community,"" McLear said, citing the eponymous movie starring Sean Penn, Milk's posthumous receipt of the Presidential Medal of Freedom and his induction into the California Hall of Fame. Milk served briefly as San Francisco's supervisor before he and Mayor George Moscone were assassinated in 1978 by Dan White, a city supervisor who had recently resigned but wanted his job back. Under the measure, the governor each year would proclaim May 22 -- Milk's birthday -- as a day of significance across the state. The bill was one of 704 signed Sunday -- most of them near the midnight deadline -- by Schwarzenegger, said spokesman Aaron McLear. The legislation passed the state Senate in May and the state Assembly last month. The legislation has been divisive, with the governor's office receiving more than 100,000 phone calls and e-mails, most of them in opposition, spokeswoman Andrea McCarthy said last month. But she added that most of the Twitter posts the governor received were in favor of the bill. Schwarzenegger vetoed a similar bill last year, saying he believed Milk should be recognized at the local level. Milk was a ""unique"" historical figure who led a civil rights movement and then was ""assassinated in his public office for being who he was,"" State Sen. Mark Leno, a Democrat, told CNN last month. The day of significance would not close schools or state offices, according to its text. However, Randy Thomasson, the president of SaveCalifornia.com, said the bill was vague and could allow for a number of things at schools, including gay pride parades or ""mock gay weddings."" ""Harvey Milk was a terrible role model for children,"" said Thomasson, whose organization opposed the bill. ""The reality is Harvey Milk is a hero to so many people and a great role model,"" said Geoff Kors, executive director of Equality California, the group that backed the bill introduced by Leno. ""It's very appropriate that the state he worked in and passed the first gay rights bill in the country should honor him."" He said the bill marks the first time any state has officially honored an openly gay person. Leno said that claims that the bill would lead to schools holding gay-pride parades and similar activities were ""hyperbole."" The bill ""mandates nothing,"" he said, although it ""affords an educational opportunity."" President Obama posthumously honored Milk with a Presidential Medal of Freedom this year, and Sean Penn portrayed him in the 2008 film ""Milk,"" for which he received an Oscar for best actor.","Bill commemorates Harvey Milk, the first openly gay politician elected in California .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Investigators have raised the wreckage of the helicopter involved in Saturday's deadly mid-air collision over the Hudson River, but they were still looking for the small plane involved in the crash, authorities said Sunday. Divers unload a body from their raft onto a police boat Sunday. Nine people are believed dead in the crash. New York police said they believed side-scan sonar pointed them to the wreckage of the Piper Saratoga PA-32 just north of where the helicopter went down, but Deborah Hersman, chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said swift current and low visibility were hindering divers. The search stopped as a storm approached Sunday evening and will resume Monday morning, police said. Nine people, including five Italian tourists, were aboard the two aircraft when they collided over the river shortly before noon Saturday. Seven bodies had been pulled out of the river by Sunday afternoon, Hersman said. Authorities believe none of the nine people aboard the two aircraft survived the crash. Neither aircraft was required to carry electronic ""black boxes"" that record cockpit voices and flight data on larger planes, but electronic navigational devices on board might retain some information that could help the probe, Hersman said. Investigators are trying to establish the facts of the crash but won't determine the probable cause for some time, Hersman said.  See where the collision occurred » . ""We are looking at everything. Nothing has been ruled out at this point in time,"" she said. Most of the Eurocopter AS350 had been lifted out of the Hudson on Sunday and taken to a pier in Hoboken, New Jersey, across the river from Manhattan, for examination, Hersman said. The helicopter was taking the five Italians on a 12-minute sightseeing tour around New York and had taken off from a heliport in midtown Manhattan shortly before the crash, she said.  Watch crews search for victims » . New York police identified the pilot of the helicopter as Jeremy Clark, 32. He had worked for the operator, Liberty Helicopter Sightseeing Tours, for about a year and a half and had 2,700 helicopter flight hours, Hersman said. iReport.com: Were you there? Send images . His passengers were Michele Norelli, 51; Fabio Gallazzi, 49; Filippo Norelli, 16; Giacomo Gallazzi, 15; and Tiziana Pedroni, 44, all of Bologna, Italy. The plane took off from a Philadelphia-area airfield Saturday morning, landed at New Jersey's Teterboro Airport and was bound for Ocean City, New Jersey, with three people aboard -- the owner and pilot, Steven Altman, 60, of Ambler, Pennsylvania; his brother, Daniel Altman, 49, of Dresher, Pennsylvania; and Daniel Altman's son Douglas, 16. Controllers lost contact with the plane at 11:53 a.m., when it was at an altitude of about 1,100 feet, Hersman said.  View images from the scene » . Hersman said the NTSB has recorded eight accidents and one ""incident"" involving Liberty, but Saturday's crash was the first to involve fatalities. Previous accidents included a 2007 case in which a helicopter crash-landed in the Hudson from a height of 500 feet, but without injuring passengers; a 2008 incident in which one helicopter taking off clipped another on the ground; a 2008 incident in which a pilot caused ""substantial damage"" to a helicopter while landing during an instructional session. In 2001, a Liberty pilot made an ""improper decision"" to continue flying in poor weather at night, causing the helicopter to hit trees, according to the NTSB. Marcia Horowitz, a spokeswoman for the tour operator, said Liberty executives ""are cooperating fully"" with investigators. ""Right now, the company is focusing its efforts on cooperating with the NTSB and giving as much information as it can,"" Horowitz said. ""At this time, their priority is to help with the family of their pilot, and of course the families that were involved in the accident."" Investigators will focus on radio communications along the congested air corridor at the time of the crash and examine any pictures or video contributed by the public, Hersman told CNN earlier. Witness accounts and still photographs already provided ""good information"" to investigators, she said. A witness told investigators he saw the airplane approach the helicopter from behind, and the plane's right wing make ""contact with the helicopter,"" Hersman said. The witness, another Liberty pilot who was refueling at a nearby heliport, said he tried to warn the helicopter pilot but got no response. Other witnesses reported seeing debris flying from the helicopter as it slammed into the water. Arnold Stevens, who saw the collision from the W Hotel in Hoboken, said the helicopter ""dropped like a rock,"" while one of the plane's wings was sheared off and it began ""corkscrewing"" into the water, he said. The busy airspace surrounding Manhattan has been the site of several recent aeronautical accidents. Earlier this year, a US Airways plane with 155 people on board ditched into the Hudson after apparently striking birds upon takeoff from New York's LaGuardia Airport, officials said. Capt. Chesley B. ""Sully"" Sullenberger's landing, which resulted in no deaths or serious injuries, was captured on closed circuit television. In 2006, Yankees pitcher Cory Lidle, 34, and his flight instructor were killed when the ballplayer's plane crashed into a high-rise apartment building near the East River, city officials said.

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- A leading UK hospital has defended its practice of using organs donated by smokers after the death of a soldier who received the cancerous lungs of a heavy smoker. A close up X-ray view of a cigarette smoker's lungs. Corporal Matthew Millington, 31, died at his home in 2008, less than a year after receiving a transplant that was supposed to save his life at Papworth Hospital -- the UK's largest specialist cardiothoracic hospital, in Cambridgeshire, east England. Papworth Hospital released a statement saying using donor lungs from smokers was not ""unusual."" The statement added that the hospital had no option but to use lungs from smokers as ""the number of lung transplants carried out would have been significantly lower,"" if they didn't. Should hospitals use smokers' lungs in transplants? An inquest held last week heard that Millington, who served in the Queen's Royal Lancers, was serving in Iraq in 2005 when he was diagnosed with an incurable condition that left him unable to breathe. He was told he required a transplant and in April 2007 received a double lung transplant at Papworth Hospital. Less than a year later, doctors discovered a tumor in the new lungs. Despite radiotherapy, Millington died on February 8, 2008, at his family home near Stoke-on-Trent, in Staffordshire. The inquest found a radiologist failed to highlight the growth of a cancerous tumor on the donor lungs. Tests found that he had received the lungs of a donor who smoked up to 50 cigarettes a day, the inquest at North Staffordshire coroner's court heard. The hospital said in the statement: ""This is an extremely rare case. Papworth Hospital has a very strong track record of high quality outcomes and this is an extremely rare case. ""Patients who are accepted on to the transplant waiting list have no other option open to them, however, we must stress that all donor organs are screened rigorously prior to transplantation. ""Using lungs from donors who have smoked in the past is not unusual. During 2008/09 146 lung transplants were carried out in the UK. ""During the same period 84 people died on the waiting list. If we had a policy that said we did not use the lungs of those who had smoked, then the number of lung transplants carried out would have been significantly lower."" The tumor's growth was accelerated by the immuno-suppressive drugs Millington was taking to prevent his body rejecting the transplanted lungs, the inquest heard. North Staffordshire coroner Ian Smith recorded that Millington, had died of ""complications of transplant surgery and immuno-suppressive drug treatment.""","Iraq veteran Matthew Millington died after transplant using cancerous lungs .

"(CNN) -- California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a new bill into law Sunday that will fine paparazzi for taking photos that invade a celebrity's right to privacy. The law also targets media outlets who purchase the photos. Singer Britney Spears' run-ins with paparazzi took center stage a few years ago when she took an umbrella to a photographer's SUV. Throngs of photographers often jockey to get the perfect shot of a celebrity, but that doesn't mean it's welcomed. Britney Spears famously had enough one night, taking an umbrella to a photographer's SUV. In 1998, Schwarzenegger himself had his car swarmed by paparazzi while he was picking up his child from school. Jennifer Aniston received $550,000 and an apology from a photographer who used a high-powered telephoto lens to shoot her in the backyard wearing only panties.  Watch how stars impact paparazzi » . While paparazzi may get a bad rap for their methods, celebrity columnist Ben Widdicombe said things are not always what they seem. ""A lot of times the shot you see in the magazine is actually orchestrated by the celebrity themselves,"" said celebrity columnist Ben Widdicombe.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Last year's inaugural Prix Pictet photography award for environmental sustainability produced a stunning shortlist of photos. Ed Kashi has documented the impact oil has made on the Niger Delta in Africa. This year is no different with 12 photographers in the running for the first prize of 100,000 CHF ($97,500). The theme in 2009 is described simply as ""Earth."" The aim is to highlight how man exploits the planet's resources and how this impacts the landscapes and communities surrounding them. In an extraordinary series of photos Canadian Christopher Anderson captures how the quest for raw materials affects Venezuela. In ""The Diminishing Present,"" Portuguese-born Edgar Martins records forest landscapes in the moments before they are engulfed by flames. In ""Curse of the Black Gold: 50 Years of Oil in the Niger Delta,"" Ed Kashi captures the impact of the oil industry on Nigeria's environment and people since it was first discovered five decades ago. Kashi, an American photojournalist, spent three years compiling his photos of the Niger Delta, making a total of five trips to the troubled region. Kashi told CNN: ""It was truly one of the most graphic examples of economic inequity that I have ever seen. Especially with the backdrop of hundreds of billions of oil wealth that has been generated over the previous 50 years."" As a result of his work, Kashi says that his photos are now being used by universities and NGOs to raise awareness to try and effect change. To him, this has been one of the most gratifying and exciting by-products of his work. One of this year's most intriguing entries is by Sammy Baloji, who superimposes colonial black and white archive photos of Belgian-run mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo and places them over his color images of the decaying mines as seen today. Nadav Kander's images of China's Yangtze River depict communities adjusting to the changes caused by the re-routing of the country's largest river.

"Editor's note: CNN Contributor Bob Greene is a best-selling author whose new book is ""Late Edition: A Love Story."" Bob Greene says ordinary life stops when Muhammad Ali appears anywhere. (CNN) -- It was still early enough in the evening that the main dinner crowd had not yet started to show up; the restaurant, east of Michigan Avenue in Chicago, was less than half-filled. The party of 10 at the table by the front window had arrived promptly for their 6 p.m. reservation. Nine of the 10 studied their menus, but the 10th, the man at the head of the table, did not. Muhammad Ali, 67, stared down toward the white tablecloth and drew on a piece of paper. He sketched a picture of a mountain. There are a handful of men among us who, simply by appearing out of nowhere, make other men and women pause involuntarily to consider the long paths of their own lives. It is as if these men have always been with us, and if you should unexpectedly spot Bob Dylan in an airport, if you should see Paul McCartney walking through a hotel lobby, if you should encounter Sean Connery entering an office building, it will bring you up short. It's like opening a diary, even if you have never met them, even if you have never seen them except on a television set or a movie screen. Yet Ali is different even from them. Ali -- his story so complicated, his health failing, his imprint on the world so indelible -- makes people mist up the moment they lay eyes on him. It was happening tonight inside this restaurant called the Rosebud Steakhouse; diners at their own tables, not quite sure for a second that they were really seeing what they were seeing, let their gazes linger and could not look away. Ali drew. The other men and women at his table -- this was a gathering of family and friends to celebrate a birthday, and Ali had come into Chicago from his farm in Michigan -- talked animatedly and laughed. Ali did not speak. He wore a blue-and-white Hawaiian-style shirt; someone had tucked a white napkin into the space above the top button. Over the speaker system of the restaurant, a slowed-down acoustic knockoff of the old Tom Petty hit ""Free Fallin' "" was playing softly: . ""She's a good girl, crazy 'bout Elvis ..."" A family, across the way, talked spiritedly among themselves. They were deciding something. The father and the children stood up. From the ceiling, the song: . ""... and I'm free, free fallin' ..."" They walked over to Ali's table. ""We apologize for the intrusion,"" the father said. Ali looked toward them, showing a gentle expression. The father had a camera. He said to his children: ""This is the most famous face in the world."" It is difficult to know what the children made of this. Youth and strength and beauty are so fleeting. The man in the Hawaiian shirt once embodied all of those things, before these children were born. Three times the world heavyweight boxing champion, the center of global fascination and frenzied controversy after winning his first title and then changing his name from Cassius Clay, endlessly mesmerizing with his float-like-a-butterfly, sting-like-a-bee ring style, called ""the greatest of all time"" so often that the words became almost an official designation, the sight of his flawless face and the sound of his confident-beyond-all-dispute voice a sustaining part of the very atmosphere. ... But his road has turned hard, and here were these children, who were not around for any of that, standing with their father next to the table. Ali's family members and friends said it would be all right for the father to take some photos, so he did. When he left, Ali went back to his drawing. More diners were beginning to arrive at the restaurant. Their evenings changed the moment they caught sight of him. Some pulled out cell phones to call people across the nation; others quietly debated whether to approach him. Many years ago, I traveled the country with him to prepare a magazine profile for a special issue on the 50 men and women judged to have had the greatest impact on society during their time on Earth. Everywhere Ali went, he was mobbed; people grabbed at him, people cried out, people attempted to touch his face. In the middle of all this one day, he said to me, almost in a whisper: . ""This is the whole world. This is what my whole life is like."" That hasn't changed, although his ability to speak aloud about it has. The food began to arrive at his table. The people to his right and to his left helped him with his. He demonstrated not the least sliver of self-consciousness; this is part of his life now, and he knows how much he is loved. He handed something to a man named Cleve Walker, who has been his friend for 50 years. It was a drawing that a young girl had brought over to him earlier. She had made a picture of a butterfly and had presented it to him. Now Ali gave it to Walker, who took it across the restaurant to where the child was sitting with her family. Ali had signed his name to it. Walker handed it to the little girl. Her face lit up. Outside the restaurant, on Walton Street, a group of young men walked by, wearing officially licensed jerseys bearing the names and uniform numbers of their favorite current-day sports stars. One of the young men glanced through the windowpane but did not register that the man at whom he was looking was Ali. Ali studied the tablecloth, and a birthday cake arrived, and the others at the table began to sing in the direction of one woman among them: . ""Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you ..."" Ali did not sing nor did he look up. But then the others reached the penultimate line of the song: . ""Happy birthday, dear Marilyn ..."" And with that Ali lifted his head and gazed directly at her, right into her eyes, and smiled the most luminous smile toward her. ""... happy birthday to you."" Soon they rose to depart. Some in the restaurant, now more crowded, applauded. Ali did not react. And then he was out on the street and in a moment out of sight. Around the next corner, although they did not yet know it, people would soon be stopping in their tracks. He may be the only one who remembers his life when it was any other way. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Muhammad Ali's extraordinary life brings him instant attention .

"(CNN) -- ""China is not on the Internet, it's basically an intranet. Everything is banned by the Great Firewall,"" says Sherman So, co-author of ""Red Wired: China's Internet Revolution."" Sherman So, author of ""Red Wired,"" talks about China's online habits and Internet culture. With 338 million Internet users in June 2009, according to the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC), China is no longer a niche market of the online industry. Chinese is the second most common language on the Internet, according to The Economist, and quickly gaining ground on English. As the former technology writer for Hong Kong's daily English-language newspaper, South China Morning Post, So has been following closely China's exponential Internet developments over the past decade. What inspired her to write ""Red Wired"" was the chasm in online culture on either side of China's carefully controlled borders. ""The information gap between those who are from this part of the world and who know Chinese and those who are from another part of world and who don't is just so huge,"" observes So. ""I've talked to lots of investors, analysts, visitors to Hong Kong, and they really don't know what's happening in China. They ask the silliest questions about China and the Internet."" ""Red Wired"" tells the stories behind China's homegrown online start-ups, often overtaking dominant start-ups that have been successful in the West but which flailed after venturing into Chinese territory. One anecdote involves an advertisement by Baidu, China's most popular search engine, teasing Google China for not knowing Chinese. Google focused on high-end technology rather than Chinese linguistics. From 2002 to 2005, Google's Chinese site also suffered interference from the Chinese government, which redirected users to Baidu whenever Google's search results failed to comply with China's censorship rules. Although Google China has since learned the lingo and learned to cooperate with the higher order, it still trails Baidu with only 28 percent of the search-engine market share, compared to Baidu's 63 percent, according to a 2008 study by Analysys International. Conquering the Internet with Chinese characteristics . So what are the unique characteristics of China's Netizens? While 25.5 percent of the Chinese population is now online, CNNIC's 2008 statistics sketch a relatively coherent portrait of the mainstream majority of them: 67 percent are below the age of 30; 73 percent have only a high school education or lower; 33 percent are students; and 28 percent fall into the lowest income bracket of under $75 per month. Moreover, 78 percent go online at home and 42 percent log on at an Internet cafe. Once connected, 84 percent listen to music, 75 percent instant-message, 63 percent play online games, and only 57 percent e-mail. In short, for the vast majority of Chinese, Internet means play, not work. One could conclude that an Internet entrepreneur's target audience in China is teenage and twenty-something students, low-end consumers in search of entertainment with plenty of time to kill. Among the most salient of China's Internet start-ups are those that innovated on proven Western models by successfully adapting them to the Chinese market. Tencent, with a 77 percent market share of instant messaging services nationwide, is one of the start-ups that gets it. Tencent is now the largest Internet company in China. ""What really made [Tencent founder] Pony Ma stand out is that he viewed his QQ instant messenger differently from other IM services such as MSN and Yahoo,"" says So. ""They viewed IM as a two-way communication, so made it as efficient as possible. They targeted the high-end white-collar users, thinking they're rich, advertisers will love them, they'll buy additional services. ""Ma thought differently. QQ was a community targeting low-end users -- kids, factory workers. They don't need efficiency, they come online to kill time, to be entertained, to talk with friends, not to do work."" In a China where economic growth comes at different speeds, So believes that the Internet has leveled out the playing field. ""The online population in China comes from very modest families,"" she says. ""Forty percent go online at Internet cafes, which is the cheapest entertainment alternative you can find. It costs just 30 cents per hour. The poorest kid can afford that, and these Internet cafes can be found in the most remote regions. ""So actually the Internet is flattening out this information gap, if not material gap, because even the poorest kid in China can go online and get information. And because of piracy, they can also download lots of stuff for free."" Sea turtle power . Another recurring factor of success among Chinese Internet start-ups is their founders' extensive experience working in Silicon Valley before returning to China to launch their own business. A person who has returned to China from overseas is known in Mandarin as ""hai gui,"" which sounds the same as the Mandarin words for ""sea turtle."" Such entrepreneurial returnees include Baidu's Robin Li, Sohu's Charles Zhang and Ctrip's James Liang. ""Sea turtles bring in new ideas,"" says So. ""Like what is a search engine?"" ""Robin Li was an engineer with a patent on search mechanism, and he wanted to build a Chinese search engine. He brought in the idea, the technology and the funding. While he was still working for Infoseek in Silicon Valley, he got $1.2 million from former executives of Inktomi. Then he went back to China and recruited students and teachers from Peking University, and he built Baidu in a year. ""Finally [the sea turtle CEOs] go to the Nasdaq for IPO listing, because that is where the market really understands the Internet and can appreciate what they did."" Likewise, China is growing from both foreign interaction and the new technological and political challenges of online culture and commerce. As the ""Great Intranet"" continues to expand and evolve, China continues to explore the fragile balance between censorship and control, and enterprise and innovation.","China counts 338 million Internet users, but only 25.5 percent of its population .

"(CNN) -- The sights and sounds of rocks rolling down mountainsides are common but still captivating phenomena for the residents of the Nile Valley in central Washington state. The landslide covered up to a half-mile of Washington state Route 410 with rock up to 30 feet deep. ""Every morning I hear big rocks coming down,"" said longtime valley resident Frank Koch. But a landslide over the weekend was more than Koch and the other 1,500 people in the Nile Valley bargained for. ""We just had the whole face of the mountain just pretty much come off,"" said Valerie Royster, manager of the Woodshed Restaurant, which sits just across the road from the edge of the landslide. The slide covered a quarter-mile to half-mile of State Route 410, which connects Yakima with Mount Rainier National Park, with rock up to 30 feet deep, said Washington state Department of Transportation spokesman Mike Westbay. Westbay said 25 homes had been affected by flooding and five by the landslide itself, including a mobile home that was demolished.  See how slide blocked roads, moved homes » . Damage was estimated at $20 million, but that would likely increase, said Jim Hall, director of emergency management for Yakima County.  Watch aerial shots of landslide area » . ""My bet is it's probably going to be a lot more than that,' Hall said. Roads would needed to be rebuilt or rerouted, he said, and tons and tons of rock and debris moved. iReport.com: Are you there? Share your photos, videos . The mountain's movement attracted dozens of residents to the parking lot of the Woodshed, which Royster calls the hub of the community, on Sunday morning to take in the spectacle. ""It was a slow slide,"" she told CNN by telephone Monday morning, which meant residents had enough warning to get out of their homes and to the Woodshed's parking lot to watch nature's majesty and fury. ""It was very loud. You could watch trees coming down"" as the slide pushed the rocks in the valley's riverbed 30 to 40 feet up the opposite bank, Royster said. Afterward, residents found river fish high and dry on the hillside, she said. Westbay said the slide was like nothing the state has seen before, in that it wasn't the result of a weather or seismic event. ""We've had rockslides, mudslides, avalanches, but nothing like this,"" he said. Geologists were calling it a ""natural land movement,"" he said. Westbay said the rocks had stabilized by Tuesday morning, and crews had begun work on a temporary gravel road to restore access to residents. Flooding was the biggest obstacle to that; the slide changed the course of the Naches River, he said. For all the spectacle of the weekend, local resident Koch was impressed by something else Tuesday morning -- the government response. ""They're out there kicking bootie today,"" he said of the repair crews. ""It's pretty amazing to see government moving that fast.""","Landslide covers half-mile of highway up to 30 feet deep .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Shouting from the audience. Holding up signs blasting the health care reform bill before Congress. Frequent hissing and booing. Many Facebook and Twitter users condemned Rep. Joe Wilson for his outburst toward President Obama. Though it sounds like behavior at one of the health care town hall meetings last month, it was how some Republicans reacted to President Obama's speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday night. But Norm Ornstein, a longtime observer of Congress and an expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said the tone and behavior from members of Congress are not necessarily new. ""A lot of what went on [Wednesday] night has become fairly typical of what we've seen in the State of the Union messages over the last 10 or 12 years, where it's one side jumping up wildly and the other side sitting on their hands in stony silence."" The most memorable moment came from Rep. Joe Wilson, R-South Carolina, who shouted ""You lie"" after the president said that a Democratic-sponsored health care bill would not cover illegal immigrants. Ornstein said that in addition to being beyond the bounds of what is typical, Wilson's comment is ""just sort of stunning in the level of disrespect for not just the president but the presidency.""  Watch more of Wilson's outburst » . During several moments in Obama's speech, members of the GOP hissed and yelled at the president as he laid out his plan for reform. One Republican held a sign saying, ""What bill?"" House Minority Whip Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, was seen several times typing on his phone during the speech. Vice President Joe Biden told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" on Thursday that he was ""embarrassed for the chamber and a Congress I love."" Observers said the behavior is probably indicative of the vitriolic sentiments found during town hall meetings. ""I think a lot of those Republican members went home to their district and were met with very angry reaction from their constituents. Congress, as you know, is pretty polarized,"" said Kasie Hunt, a health care reporter for National Journal's Congress Daily. ""I think, in some ways, that's what you really saw last night: the degree of acceptance of that angry discord that we've really hadn't seen in a long time."" Hunt said there is still a lot of misunderstanding among Republican members of Congress. John O'Connor, who covers politics for The State newspaper in South Carolina, said that a lot of Wilson's anger mirrors what many feel in his home state. ""I think he feels the way a lot of people in South Carolina feel about [health care reform]. They're suspicious. They're worried. There's some fear out there about what could happen."" But O'Connor points out that South Carolina tends to be more conservative than other states, and Wilson's town halls were generally civil. ""Rep. Wilson, however, held a town hall meeting in Columbia where, for the most part, there was a pretty reasoned debate,"" he added. ""There were folks on both sides raising issues, asking questions."" Still, it might have been Wilson's constituents' anger and distrust that contributed to the outburst in Congress, O'Connor noted. ""His takeaway from that was that people support his stance, which was to oppose any version of what he's calling Obamacare,"" he said. ""So despite the fact that there was clearly some support in that audience for doing something about health care and health insurance, he kind of had a different impression of what the majority of the crowd thought."" Could Wilson face any trouble for his comments Wednesday night? Unlikely, according to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Pelosi said Thursday that there is a procedure that could have been implemented to strike Wilson's ""lie"" comment from the record. But she said the president did the right thing in continuing on and not giving it ""any more attention than it deserved."" Pelosi indicated that she would not press the issue farther. ""As far as I'm concerned, the episode was unfortunate. Mr. Wilson has apologized. It's time for us to talk about health care and not Mr. Wilson,"" she said. Political observers in South Carolina opine that the comment heard around the world ""was a little surprising."" ""This is not his personality. He's not a guy who tends to make a lot of inflammatory statements. You expect that a lot more from Rep. DeMint [Republican from South Carolina] than Wilson for sure,"" O'Connor added. Wilson said Thursday that his outburst was simply ""spontaneous.""  Watch Obama's full speech » . Meanwhile, the controversy surrounding him -- and anger on both sides of the aisle to his statement -- has helped his opponent in the 2010 midterm election. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said Thursday afternoon that since Wilson's comment, his Democratic opponent, former Marine Rob Miller, received 11,000 individual grass-roots contributions and raised more than $400,000. During the 2008 election, when support for Democrats and Obama was high, Wilson faced a tough slog against Miller. The Republican, who represents the 2nd Congressional District, including most of Columbia and parts east, won 54 percent of the vote to Miller's 46 percent. Ornstein added that Wilson's comment was an ""incredibly dumb thing to do"" for the broader picture of the Republican Party. ""It was a gift, in a way, to Barack Obama,"" he said. ""To independent voters out there, this just underscored the notion that you've got a party that is unremittingly hostile to the president that has no interest in negotiating or finding common ground.""","President Obama delivered his health care reform plan to Congress on Wednesday .

"Editor's note: Harvard Business School Professor Clayton M. Christensen and Innosight Institute Executive Director of Education Michael B. Horn are the co-authors along with Curtis W. Johnson of ""Disrupting Class: How Disruptive Innovation Will Change the Way the World Learns."" Clay Christensen says the sudden burst of federal spending on schools holds great danger. (CNN) -- Historically the federal government has been a small investor in the nation's education system. With the recent economic stimulus bill, however, this changed virtually overnight. There is great danger in the sudden and massive amount of funding -- nearly $100 billion -- that the federal government is throwing at the nation's schools. District by district, the budgetary crises into which all schools were plunging created the impetus for long-needed changes. The most likely result of this stimulus will be to give our schools the luxury of affording not to change. This is borrowed money that we're pumping into our schools, and it comes at a price. Charging education isn't changing it. That our schools need to change should not be surprising. Just walk into your local school and enter a classroom. Odds are high that it won't look too different from a classroom from a generation or two ago. Sure, there might be some computers in the back of the room and perhaps an interactive white board instead of a chalkboard, but chances are high that students will still be sitting at desks lined up in neat rows with a teacher at the front delivering the same lesson on the same day to all the students. This might be acceptable if society and the skills many people need to succeed in today's economy hadn't changed either, but they have. While U.S. schools stand still, the rest of the world is moving forward, and this has a price tag -- not just for individual children, but also for the nation. We urge the federal government to consider four criteria when creating new programs or grants for states and districts to help transform an outdated educational system into one fit for the 21st Century. First, don't fund technology that simply shoves computers and other technologies into existing classrooms. We've spent well over $60 billion in the last two decades doing just that, and there is now overwhelming evidence that when we do it, the current unsatisfactory system co-opts the technology to sustain itself. We should instead use technology funding to bolster new learning models and innovations, such as online-learning environments, to level the playing field and allow students from all walks of life -- from small, rural communities to budget-strapped urban schools -- to access the rich variety that is now available only to children in wealthy suburban districts. Second, don't fund new school buildings that look like the existing ones. If the architecture of new buildings is the same as that of existing schools -- designed around teachers delivering monolithic, one-size-fits-all lessons to large batches of students -- it will lock students into another century in which the physical infrastructure works against the flexibility needed for student-centric learning. Instead, invest in bandwidth as an infrastructure of change. The government has a productive history in investing in infrastructure that creates change and innovation -- from allocating land to those building the transcontinental railroad and the land-grant colleges in 1862 to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency funding the creation of the Internet. To allow all districts to realize the power of online learning to advance us toward a student-centric system, the federal government should help deliver broadband capabilities necessary not just for today's needs, where schools already lag, but also in anticipation of tomorrow's. Third, don't fund the institutions that are least likely to change. Our research shows that institutions are good at improving what they are structured to do, but that transformative innovations that fundamentally change the trade-off between cost and quality -- disruptive innovations -- come from start-up institutions. This means that there is a high probability that spending money on existing schools of education will only result in their doing more of the same, for example. Meanwhile, there are a host of disruptive training organizations that are providing comparable educators at lower cost, such as Teach for America, the American Board for Certification of Teacher Excellence, and New Leaders for New Schools. Alternative certification, including alternative programs from existing schools of education, has grown at a 29 percent compound annual growth rate since 1997. The government must embrace this and back the winners, not defend the old institutions. Fourth, direct more funds for research and development to create student-centric learning software. Just a fraction of 1 percent of the $600 billion in K-12 spending from all levels currently goes toward R&D. The federal government should reallocate funds so we can begin to understand not just what learning opportunities work best on average but also what works for whom and under what circumstance. It is vital to fund learning software that captures data about the student and the efficacy of different approaches so we can connect these dots. Transformation of any existing system isn't an easy process, but ignoring the laws of innovation, although it may be perhaps politically expedient in the short run, will only make it more difficult. When the federal government directs future funds toward education, having these principles in place will go a long way toward making sure we're not simply charging education, but that we have a fighting chance of changing it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Clayton Christensen and Michael Horn.","Christensen, Horn: Federal spending on schools is set to jump .

"(CNN) -- Like a lot of people, Anna Owens began using MySpace more than four years ago to keep in touch with friends who weren't in college. Our real-world friendships are often a reflection of who we connect with online, experts say. But soon she felt too old for the social-networking site, and the customizable pages with music that were fun at first began to annoy her. By the time she graduated from the University of Puget Sound, Owens' classmates weren't on MySpace -- they were on Facebook. Throughout graduate school and beyond, as her network began to expand, Owens ceased using MySpace altogether. Facebook had come to represent the whole of her social and professional universe. ""MySpace has one population, Facebook has another,"" said the 26-year-old, who works for an affordable-housing nonprofit in San Francisco, California. ""Blue-collar, part-time workers might like the appeal of MySpace more -- it definitely depends on who you meet and what they use; that's what motivates people to join and stay interested."" Is there a class divide online? Research suggests yes. A recent study by market research firm Nielsen Claritas found that people in more affluent demographics are 25 percent more likely to be found friending on Facebook, while the less affluent are 37 percent more likely to connect on MySpace. More specifically, almost 23 percent of Facebook users earn more than $100,000 a year, compared to slightly more than 16 percent of MySpace users. On the other end of the spectrum, 37 percent of MySpace members earn less than $50,000 annually, compared with about 28 percent of Facebook users. MySpace users tend to be ""in middle-class, blue-collar neighborhoods,"" said Mike Mancini, vice president of data product management for Nielsen, which used an online panel of more than 200,000 social media users in the United States in August. ""They're on their way up, or perhaps not college educated."" By contrast, Mancini said, ""Facebook [use] goes off the charts in the upscale suburbs,"" driven by a demographic that for Nielsen is represented by white or Asian married couples between the ages of 45-64 with kids and high levels of education. Even more affluent are users of Twitter, the microblogging site, and LinkedIn, a networking site geared to white-collar professionals. Almost 38 percent of LinkedIn users earn more than $100,000 a year. Nielsen also found a strong overlap between those who use Facebook and those who use LinkedIn, Mancini said. Nielsen isn't the first to find this trend. Ethnographer danah boyd, who does not capitalize her name, said she watched the class divide emerge while conducting research of American teens' use of social networks in 2006. When she began, she noticed the high school students all used MySpace, but by the end of the school year, they were switching to Facebook. When boyd asked why, the students replied with reasons similar to Owens: ""the features were better; MySpace is dangerous and Facebook is safe; my friends are here,"" boyd recalled. And then, boyd said, ""a young woman, living in a small historical town in Massachussetts said to me, 'I don't mean to be a racist or anything, but MySpace is like, ghetto.'"" For boyd, that's when it clicked. ""It's not a matter of choice between Facebook and MySpace, it was a movement to Facebook from MySpace,"" she said, a movement that largely included the educated and the upper-class. So why do our online worlds, unencumbered by what separates us in daily life, reflect humans' tendency to stick with what -- and who -- they know? A lot of it has to do with the disparate beginnings of MySpace and Facebook, said Adam Ostrow, editor-in-chief of Mashable, a blog about social media. Facebook originated at Harvard University and was limited at first to students at approved colleges before opening itself to the public in September 2006. MySpace, on the other hand, had a ""come one, come all"" policy and made a mad dash towards monetization, Ostrow said. ""They used a lot of banner ads without regard to the quality, and it really diminished the value [of the site] for the more tech-savvy demographic."" And while the Internet can build bridges between people on opposite sides of the globe, we still tend to connect with the same people through online social networks who we connect with offline, said technology writer and blogger Sarah Perez. ""It's effectively a mirror to our real world,"" she told CNN. ""Social networks are the online version of what kids do after school."" These social-networking divides are worrisome to boyd, who wrote ""Taken Out of Context: American Teen Sociality in Networked Publics."" Instead of allowing us to cross the boundaries that exist in our everyday lives, these online class differences threaten to carry those boundaries into the future. ""The social-network infrastructure is going to be a part of everything going forward, just like [Web] search is,"" boyd said. ""The Internet is not this great equalizer that rids us of the problems of the physical world -- the Internet mirrors and magnifies them. The divisions that we have in everyday life are going to manifest themselves online."" Jason Kaufman, a research science fellow with the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University, examined the Facebook profiles of a group of college students over four years and found that even within Facebook, there's evidence of self-segregation. Multiracial students tended to have more Facebook friends than students of other backgrounds and were often the sole connection between white and black circles, Kaufman said. Nonetheless, Kaufman feels that social networks may one day help us overcome our instinct to associate with those who share our income level, education, or racial background. ""I think it's fair to say that the Web has great potential to at least mitigate everyday tendencies towards self-segregation and social exclusion,"" Kaufman said. ""In some ways, [Facebook] levels the playing field of friendship stratification. In the real world, you have very close friends and then there are those you just say ""Hi"" to when you pass them on the street. ""The playing field is a lot more level in that you can find yourself having a wall-to-wall exchange with just an acquaintance. If you pick up the unlikely friend, not of your race or income bracket, the network may [help you] establish a more active friendship than if you met them in real life."" But MySpace's users still find something appealing about MySpace that they don't about Facebook, and it may have nothing to do with class or race, blogger Perez said. ""It's not just the demographics that have people picking one over the other,"" Perez said. ""It also comes down to what activities you like. If you like music, you'll still be on MySpace. If you're more into applications, then you might go to Facebook because you're addicted to Mafia Wars or whatever."" In the end, boyd isn't as concerned about the reasons behind these divisions online as she is about the consequences of people only networking within their chosen social-media groups. ""Friendships and family relationships are socially divided; people self-segregate to deal with racism sometimes,"" she said. ""Okay, fine: We've made a decision to self-segregate, but what happens when politicians go on Facebook and think they're reaching the whole public? What happens when colleges only go on Facebook to promote?"" When and if that does happen, Mashable's Ostrow said, we'll know perhaps we've given social networks more credit than they're worth. ""When it comes to information, I don't think social networks are the best source for that. The Internet is so open,"" said Ostrow, who believes users would go beyond their networks to search out information online. If you're looking to branch out of your social network box, your best option may be Twitter. Nielsen's survey didn't find a dominant social class on Twitter as much as they found a geographical one: Those who use Twitter are more likely to live in an urban area where there's greater access to wireless network coverage, Mancini said. ""The simplicity of Twitter definitely creates less of a divide, because it's not a relationship like it is on MySpace or Facebook,"" Ostrow said. ""If you live in the middle of nowhere or you live in a city, you can follow anyone about anything.""","A recent Nielsen study finds class differences between online social networks .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Jury selection is set to start Monday in a trial pitting two children of Martin Luther King Jr. against their brother, whom they accuse of mishandling the late civil rights leader's estate. Bernice King and her brother Martin Luther King III say  Dexter King took funds from their father's estate. Bernice King and Martin Luther King III sued their brother Dexter King in July 2008, one month after accusing him of converting ""substantial funds from the estate's financial account at Bank of America"" for his own use, according to the lawsuit. Also named as a defendant is the Martin Luther King Jr. estate, which is incorporated. Dexter King is the corporation's president and chief executive, in addition to being the estate's administrator. The three are the only shareholders in the corporation, and the plaintiffs hold at least 20 percent of its outstanding shares. The lawsuit contends Dexter King illegally and fraudulently converted estate funds and should be forced to repay the money and reimburse the plaintiffs' legal costs. The document, which lists five counts, does not say how much he is accused of taking. Dexter King has denied the accusations. The lawsuit reveals a very public fissure in an iconic family that has always professed unity, particularly as questions have swirled around some of their financial dealings. The three are the only surviving children of Martin Luther King Jr., who was assassinated in 1968, and Coretta Scott King, who died in 2006. Their oldest child, Yolanda King, died in 2007. Bernice King administers her mother's estate. In a countersuit, Dexter King has asked a judge to force Bernice King to turn over their mother's personal papers, including love letters central to a now-defunct $1.4 million book deal. Martin Luther King III and Bernice King complained that Dexter King refused to hold shareholders meetings, which they said was another example of his lack of transparency in handling their father's estate. There had been no shareholders' meeting of the corporation since 2004, something that Dexter King blamed on the distraction caused by the deaths of his mother and sister. Judge Ural D. Glanville ordered a meeting, which was held last week. In a hearing held in late September, Glanville, who will preside over the trial in Fulton County Superior Court, also expressed serious concern about governance of the King estate. The judge issued an order saying ""the court is extremely troubled."" He noted that Dexter King, as the majority shareholder, wields significant power in the corporation because he holds 80 percent of its shares. He alone can constitute a quorum for transacting business, the order says. The judge warned all three Kings that any failure to comply with the Georgia Corporation Code could result in the dissolution of the corporation and the appointment of a receiver.","Bernice King, Martin Luther King III accuse brother of taking estate funds for own use .

"(CNN) -- It's the most complex construction project in history. NASA's funding of the international space station is scheduled to end in 2016. Flying 250 miles overhead, the international space station can be seen with the naked eye, orbiting the Earth every 90 minutes, usually carrying a crew of six. Now, before construction of the station is even complete, there is already talk of when the lights will be turned off. NASA is waiting for the Obama administration to decide how much longer the station will fly and exactly which direction the U.S. space agency will take next -- a return to the moon, or maybe a trip to Mars? The initial phase of the international space station was launched in 1998, although the station is still being expanded. The U.S. is one of 16 countries that help build and operate the station, whose laboratory runs a number of science experiments, including measuring the effects of space conditions, such as weightlessness, on humans. The U.S. contribution to the space station so far: $44 billion. (NASA says it does not keep track of contributions from the other 15 partners.) NASA's funding of the space station is currently scheduled to end in 2016. ""The general idea that we would spend approximately 11 years building the space station, get it to its full operational capability, and then kind of abandon it a few years later ... doesn't make a lot of sense,"" said Robert Braun, a former NASA chief engineer. Braun currently is the director of Georgia Tech's Space Systems Design Laboratory. An independent committee reviewing the future of U.S. human spaceflight recently recommended to the White House that the station's life be extended to 2020.  Watch more on the future of the space station » . ""You've got all of these different countries working together on this common project in space. And if we go ahead and stop ... it's going to break up that framework,"" said Leroy Chiao, a former space station commander and shuttle astronaut who sits on the advisory panel. ""The different countries around the world will lose confidence in the U.S. as a leader in space exploration,"" he said. But the committee also found that the U.S. space program appears to be pursuing goals that exceed current funding levels. So it will be up to the Obama administration to chart a new course. NASA has been planning on retiring the aging space shuttle fleet upon completion of the space station in 2011. That shuttle funding was to be used instead for NASA's next great endeavor -- the Constellation Program, which would take astronauts back to the moon. But that means NASA would no longer have its own spacecraft to ferry astronauts to the space station. Until a new space vehicle is ready to fly, the U.S. will have to hitch a ride on Russia's Soyuz capsule. One of the options the advisory committee has recommended is that NASA fly shuttles on a reduced schedule through 2015 to help close that gap, Chiao told CNN. ""That gap is real,"" he said. ""It's going to be there, and the only access we're going to have [to the space station] is to buy seats on the Russian Soyuz."" Part of the problem with the U.S. space agency's funding gap, according to some experts, is that NASA's culture is to build. ""We're always looking for that next engineering or construction project,"" said Marco Caceres, a senior analyst on aerospace at the Teal Group. ""But the big thing is the science, and you can't sell that to the public. It's not sexy,"" he said. ""So NASA keeps moving on to other things, without putting the really hard work into doing what will benefit the people the most -- doing the things that station was designed to do in the first place."" Until now, the majority of the science done in space involves human experiments with microgravity. Such research is considered essential for long-duration missions on the space station, or for future trips to the moon or Mars. Biomedical challenges such as bone loss, cardiovascular issues, psychosocial issues and exposure to radiation must be resolved before humans can venture too far from Earth for too long. While promised space research on diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's hasn't happened yet, some space science has brought encouragement. Astrogenetix, a private company, has used the zero-gravity environment aboard space shuttle flights to develop a salmonella vaccine, which is moving through the Food and Drug Administration's approval process. Growing the bacteria in space is much easier than it is on Earth. ""That process on Earth ... can take up to 10 years. And we send it up to space, for really three trips, and we found that we already had a vaccine for salmonella,"" said company Chairman Thomas Pickens. Astrogenetix also conducted an experiment on the last shuttle flight aimed at producing a vaccine for MRSA, a highly resistant staph infection. Pickens said that up until now, the space station hasn't been a viable location for long-term, commercialized experiments. ""They've been under construction, and you wouldn't do heart surgery in the middle of a construction site for a skyscraper,"" he said. Now all NASA needs is direction from the White House -- and, of course, money. The station's backers say you don't spend a fortune constructing a customized house only to knock it down. But NASA also may need to conserve funds for a possible mission to Mars. Observers should find out soon whether the hope of groundbreaking science is enough for Obama to keep the space station aloft.","President Obama must decide how long to fund the international space station .

"(CNN) -- Rap star T.I. threw himself a going-away party Sunday night, less than two days before he was scheduled to begin serving a prison sentence on federal weapons charges.

He is scheduled to head to prison Tuesday to start a 366-day sentence. During Sunday's concert, the 28-year-old reiterated a message that's become familiar in recent weeks: He wants others to learn from his mistakes. ""I'm doing the best I can to get out there, man, and put something positive on these young kids, man,"" T.I. said during the show. ""I try my best. I need y'all help, though."" The rapper played to a sell-out crowd of 16,000 people, said Kenan Woods, a spokesman for the arena. T.I., whose given name is Clifford Harris, played through much of his catalog, including the hits ""Whatever You Like,"" ""Live Your Life"" and the Grammy-winning ""Swagga Like Us,"" Woods said. At times in the show, Harris was joined on stage by fellow rapper Soulja Boy and by his five children and mother, Woods said. He was greeted by a welcoming crowd, and some members of the audience held up signs supporting him. Tickets for the show started at just $10, according to the arena, which called the event ""T.I.'s Final Goodbye Bash."" Harris has been the subject of an MTV reality show, ""T.I.'s Road to Redemption,"" in the lead-up to the prison term. He was sentenced in March on weapons charges related to purchasing machine guns and silencers. In addition to serving prison time, T.I. was placed on house arrest, was given community service and was ordered to pay a $100,300 fine. Though he had been in legal trouble before, Harris' current situation began when he was arrested just hours before he was to perform at the BET Hip-Hop Awards in Atlanta. The rapper had provided a bodyguard with $12,000 to buy weapons. Harris was not permitted to own any guns, however, because he was convicted in 1998 on felony drug charges -- possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute -- in Cobb County, in suburban Atlanta. After his arrest, he entered a plea agreement, which federal authorities called unique because it allowed the rapper to remain out of prison for a year while he performed community service. Harris has already left a strong mark on the hip-hop genre, music experts told CNN, which should position his career well when he is released. Harris had been named to the Forbes list of top-earning rappers, making an estimated $16 million in 2006. Some music industry observers have said T.I.'s prison term will only make him more popular. ""I think that if anything, it will gain him more fans and actually support his fan base, because he's talked about making a mistake,"" Emil Wilbekin, editor in chief of Giant Magazine, told CNN. ""He's talked about taking care of the error of his ways."" The Atlanta rapper has expressed remorse for the situation. ""I would like to say thank you to some and apologize to others,"" he said at his sentencing in March. ""In my life, I have been placed in the worst-case scenario and had to make the best of it."" In a March interview with CNN's T.J. Holmes, Harris said he no longer felt like he needed to carry weapons to protect himself. He said people should not idolize him for what he's gone through, but should take note of the fact that he has taken responsibility for his actions. ""You shouldn't take the things that I've gone through, and the negative parts of my life, and admire me for that. If anything, admire me for how I've accepted responsibility for the part I played in placing myself in these situations, and what I've done to recover from it,"" Harris said.","T.I. performed Sunday, less than two days before his prison term starts .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- An attorney for convicted Washington-area sniper John Allen Muhammad, who is scheduled to be executed November 10, will seek clemency from Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine on October 22. John Allen Muhammad listen to testimony from victims' relatives during his 2004 sentencing. Jonathan Sheldon said he will also file an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court on November 2. He posted the dates Tuesday on his law firm's Web site. During a three-week period in October 2002, police say, Muhammad and young accomplice Lee Boyd Malvo shot 13 people, killing 10. Malvo, who was 17 at the time, was convicted in one shooting and was sentenced to life in prison. Muhammad is to be executed for the murder of Dean Harold Meyers at a Manassas, Virginia, gas station. Meyers was killed by a single bullet, which became the signature of the two-person sniper team. Kaine told CNN affiliate WTOP Radio during its ""Ask the Governor"" program last month that he couldn't imagine a circumstance under which he would grant clemency. ""I know of nothing in this case that would suggest that there is any credible claim of innocence or that there was anything procedurally wrong with the prosecution,"" Kaine said. Under Virginia law, condemned prisoners can choose to die by electric chair or by lethal injection.

"PHOENIX, Arizona (CNN)  -- Noah Gotbaum told a Phoenix airport operator that his wife was distraught after being bumped from a flight and that her situation was a ""medical emergency,"" not a case of ""some lout who's just drank too much."" Video shows Carol Ann Gotbaum being arrested at a Phoenix airport shortly before she died while in custody. His wife, Carol Ann Gotbaum, died in a police holding cell at the airport, apparently strangling herself as she tried to maneuver her way out of handcuffs that were secured behind her back. Police have released a video showing officers arresting the 45-year-old  woman at Phoenix's Sky Harbor International Airport just before she died on September 28. Phoenix Police Sgt. Andy Hill said: ""Officers had no information ... that Ms. Gotbaum had traveled unescorted and alone from New York City to Phoenix, Arizona, in order to seek treatment for a substance abuse issue. ""The officers had no knowledge of any of Ms. Gotbaum's personal issues. They had not been apprised of any calls from the family to the airport seeking to locate Ms. Gotbaum."" Michael Manning, a Phoenix attorney whom Gotbaum's family has retained, told CNN Gotbaum was calm, sober, and committed to alcohol treatment when she arrived at the Phoenix airport that day. ""By the time she reached the gate and found out she was denied boarding, she had a very, very strong emotional reaction to that, and we believe that that wasn't just a result of her being upset because of her determination to get well. We believe she may have been drinking,"" Manning said. According to the police report released Thursday, Gotbaum's husband, Noah, called the airport several times that day, trying to reach his wife or the airport police, telling them they didn't know the circumstances involving his wife, whom he described as suicidal. Noah Gotbaum on Thursday claimed his wife's body in Phoenix after an autopsy, and the body was to be returned to New York. In a statement Wednesday, police said they attempted to calm an irate Gotbaum before arresting her. They also said authorities had no idea of her ""personal issues,"" including her plans to check into an alcohol treatment center. Sgt. Hill said Thursday that there were indications alcohol may have played a role in the incident. Toxicology tests administered during the autopsy would determine if that were the case, but results of such tests typically take weeks. Gotbaum, who was flying through Phoenix on her way to Tucson, became angry when she was denied access to her flight and argued with a gate attendant, police said. According to the police statement, Gotbaum ""became agitated and loud"" and threw her hand-held PDA, which shattered after narrowly missing a person. She then left the gate area, but the attendant summoned police. The video showed Gotbaum after she apparently had just left the gate area. She was by herself, standing in the middle of a concourse, doubled over, and she seemed to be screaming.  Watch how the arrest video answers some questions, raises others » . The video contains no audio, but witnesses -- including a federal police officer -- said Gotbaum was ""screaming at the top of her lungs, 'I'm not a terrorist, I'm not a terrorist,' "" according to Sgt. Mike Polombo, who is investigating the death. In the video, Gotbaum backs away from an officer who reaches for her, and she becomes combative before dropping to the ground. With officers on the ground attempting to handcuff her, she continues to scream profanities, Polombo said. Gotbaum was placed in a holding room, and a female officer searched her, but she ""continued to be uncooperative,"" the police statement said. ""Ms. Gotbaum was handcuffed with her hands behind her back, and additionally those handcuffs were attached to a shackle that kept her attached to the bench,"" the report says. Phoenix police policy is that prisoners can be left alone in holding rooms as long as they are checked every 15 minutes. Department policy bans cameras in holding rooms to protect detainees' privacy. After officers left, Gotbaum continued to scream, the police statement said. However, police checked on her when she fell silent and found her unconscious. ""Initial information ... indicated that Ms. Gotbaum had somehow worked the handcuffs to the front of her body, probably from under her legs, and had pulled the chain from the shackle across her neck area,"" the statement said. Officers used cardiopulmonary resuscitation, a defibrillator and other measures in futile attempts to save her life. Firefighters arrived and pronounced Gotbaum dead. The officers involved ""are still very upset about what happened,"" Hill said. ""They did everything they could to save Ms. Gotbaum."" Hill said police are not aware of any policy violations, but he said the death remains under investigation, as any in-custody death would be. CNN security analyst Mike Brooks, a law enforcement veteran, said it appeared from the video that Phoenix police did everything by the book. ""It looks like they did everything they could to calm her down, and then she was still combative,"" Brooks said. ""We didn't see any use of any TASER, no pepper spray, and in my opinion, no excessive force was used here.""

"(Health.com)  -- An analysis of the sickest swine flu patients in Australia, Canada, Mexico, and New Zealand suggests that relatively healthy adolescents and young adults are among the most likely to get very sick after an H1N1 infection, a pattern similar to that seen in the 1918 influenza pandemic. The most important message is that children should get the H1N1 vaccination, Dr. Neil Schachter said. Almost all critically ill patients in the studies were sick for only a few days before rapidly progressing to more severe symptoms and respiratory failure, which required treatment with a breathing machine, according to three studies published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The mortality rate ranged from 14.3 percent to 41.4 percent, depending on the country. The findings may help shine some light on what the 2009 H1N1 flu season may bring, and who may be hit the hardest by the swine flu during the next few months. ""These studies are telling us that young people are at risk for bad complications of H1N1 and under usual circumstances, [seasonal] flu does not cause acute respiratory failure in younger people,"" says Dr. Neil Schachter, the medical director of the respiratory care department at Mount Sinai Medical Center, in New York City, and the author of The Good Doctor's Guide to Colds and Flu. The analysis of cases in Australia and New Zealand looked at people who developed severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (a condition in which the lungs fill with fluid) and were put on a life-support system known as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). This artificial heart and lung machine system, which puts oxygen into the blood and then carries this blood to the body tissues, is considered risky and expensive; as a result, it is not readily available in every hospital. The mortality rate was 21 percent for these patients, although it may have been higher without this treatment, the authors say. Health.com: 8 ways swine flu is changing society . ""These studies provide important signals about what clinicians and hospitals may confront in the coming months,"" Dr. Douglas B. White, and Dr. Derek C. Angus, of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, write in an editorial accompanying the new studies. In young, healthy patients, H1N1 can quickly cause respiratory failure that can't necessarily be reversed with mechanical ventilation, although such patients are not currently a priority group for H1N1 vaccination, they note. In the Canadian study, about 30 percent to 40 percent of the patients had lung disease, were obese, or had high blood pressure, a history of smoking, or diabetes. Overall, 14.3 percent of 168 critically ill people with confirmed or suspected H1N1 died within 28 days. The mortality rate in the Mexican study was strikingly higher. In Mexico City, where the H1N1 pandemic was first reported, 41.4 percent of 58 critically ill people died within 60 days of developing the flu. Health.com: 10 best big cities for people with asthma . Those people who died from H1N1 got sicker earlier in the course of their illness, had extremely low levels of oxygen in their blood, and had multiple organ failure. Their average age was 44 years old, and 54 of 58 patients needed mechanical ventilation. Other signs of more severe H1N1 included fever and severe trouble breathing. Health.com: 10 ways you put yourself at risk for swine flu (without realizing it!) In the Canadian study (in which the average age was 21.4), the critically ill tended to be hospitalized within four days of developing flu symptoms, and there was about a one-day lapse between hospital admission to intensive care unit (ICU) admission. As in the Mexico City study, younger patients with low blood oxygen and multisystem organ failure were hardest hit. What's more, the critically ill tended to require mechanical ventilation and rescue therapies to aid in breathing. Health.com: 8 causes of chronic cough . In both countries, the H1N1 outbreak lasted about three months. ""It is not clear of hospitals' need to invest in this ECMO technology because this has not proven very successful in other respiratory illnesses,"" says  Schachter. ""We do know that treating H1N1 with antivirals such as Tamiflu (oseltamivir) and Relenza (zanamivir) did help improve mortality."" The most important message is that children should get the H1N1 vaccination, which is safe, he says. ""The technology for making swine flu vaccine is no different than that used to make the regular flu vaccine, so in principle, there should be no differences in terms of safety,"" he explains. ""Recent surveys have shown that Americans are iffy about whether they will let their children receive this novel vaccine."" Dr. James B. McAuley, the director of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at the Rush University Medical Center, in Chicago, Illinois, notes that the studies focused on the sickest of the sick patients. Health.com: 7 surprising triggers of lung trouble . ""The mortality rate can be high for a small subset of people, but the overall death rate is closer to seasonal flu than the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2003,"" he says. ""This is a serious flu and there is mortality, but it is about the same as with the seasonal flu -- maybe a little worse."" As to why younger people seem to be hit hardest, the current school of thought is that perhaps a similar virus circulated 50 or 60 years ago, so older people could have immunity to H1N1. McAuley's advice? ""Definitely get the vaccine,"" he says. (He says his own children have already received the H1N1 vaccination.) The editorialists write that the burden is on the public health system to heed the warnings in the new studies and prepare for the coming flu season: ""Any deaths from 2009 influenza A(H1N1) will be regrettable, but those that result from insufficient planning and inadequate preparation will be especially tragic."" Such planning should include widespread availability of antivirals, antibiotics, and mechanical ventilation systems. Enter to win a monthly Room Makeover Giveaway from MyHomeIdeas.com .

"(CNN) -- A Mississippi schoolteacher was sentenced to life without parole Wednesday for shooting and stabbing to death her lover's pregnant fiancee in 2006. Carla Hughes met the victim's fiance at the middle school where she was a teacher. The same jury that convicted Carla Hughes of two counts of murder Tuesday for the death of Avis Banks spared her life, declining to impose the death penalty. Mississippi is among the states that consider murdering a pregnant woman to be taking two lives. Madison County District Attorney Michael Guest asked the panel of nine women and three men to sentence Hughes to death based on the gruesome nature of Banks' murder. Banks, 27, was found lying in a pool of blood on November 29, 2006, in the garage of the Ridgeland home she shared with Keyon Pittman, the father of her unborn child. She was five months pregnant. She had been shot four times in the leg, chest and head, and then stabbed multiple times in the face and neck as she lay dying, according to medical testimony. Prosecutors alleged that Hughes killed Banks so she could have Pittman, a colleague at Chastain Middle School in Jackson, to herself. ""She took Avis Banks' life and the life of her unborn child because she wanted that life,"" the prosecutor said. The jury deliberated Wednesday for about an hour to decide on the sentence after hearing emotional testimony from seven defense witnesses, including her parents. ""Carla has been a kind, loving person all her life,"" said Carl Hughes, who adopted his daughter when she was 6 weeks old. ""I'm not asking you, I'm pleading with you, to spare my daughter's life,"" said Hughes, who is also a teacher. He said that the person portrayed by prosecutors as a cold-blooded killer was completely different from the accomplished honors student, equestrian and beauty pageant contestant that he knew and loved. Hughes' pastor and friends also took the stand to describe her work mentoring youths, volunteering at church and at the school where she met the victim's husband. Suspicion initially fell on Pittman, who admitted to having an affair with Hughes, a language arts teacher. A key prosecution witness, Pittman told the jury he began seeing Hughes one month after finding out his girlfriend was pregnant. He testified that the two met frequently in Hughes' home and even went out of town together, but he insisted the relationship was based solely on sex. Throughout the trial, defense lawyers maintained her innocence and attempted to cast blame on Pittman, portraying him as a womanizer seeking to avoid the burden of fatherhood. Prosecutors alleged the murder weapons connected Hughes to the crime. The defendant's cousin testified that he lent her a knife and a loaded .38 caliber revolver the weekend before Banks' death. Ballistics tests matched the bullets from Banks' body to the gun, which Hughes returned unloaded to her cousin after her first interview with police. None of Banks' relatives testified at the sentencing. Instead, the jury heard from a forensic pathologist, who described the nature of Banks' injuries. Madison County Deputy District Attorney John Emfinger urged the jury to look past Hughes' prior achievements and focus on the crime in rendering its sentence. ""In my mind, this overshadows everything else she's done in life. She took the lives of two people in that garage,"" he said in his closing argument Wednesday. ""When that door opened, (Avis Banks) was not met by a beauty pageant winner, she was not met by a member of the mayor's youth council, she was not met by a peacemaker. ... She was met by a stone-cold killer,"" he said. In Session's Jean Casarez contributed to this report.","Same jury that convicted Carla Hughes of murder declines to impose death penalty .

"(CNN) -- Jennifer Schuett didn't know it, but the DNA of the man suspected of attacking her in 1990 was sitting in an FBI database for at least 13 years, just waiting for a connection to be made. Dennis Earl Bradford, a 40-year-old welder, was arrested after DNA allegedly tied him to the crime. She was 8 and had been abducted from her room, raped and left for dead in a field. All she knew about the man who kidnapped her was that he called himself Dennis. His DNA was found on underwear left behind, but the sample was too small at the time to get a match. Schuett helped police create a detailed sketch of the man who attacked her. CNN normally does not identify victims of sexual assaults. But Schuett decided to go public with her story and her name to increase the chances of finding and prosecuting her attacker. For nearly two decades, there were no answers. But with technological advances, authorities were able to retest the small sample of the attacker's DNA last year. With those results, a suspect would be found -- and it would all be because he was convicted for an eerily similar crime. Dennis Earl Bradford, 40, was arrested Tuesday in connection with Schuett's abduction and attempted murder. Authorities believe he was the man who kidnapped Schuett from her Dickinson, Texas, home, choked her, dragged her from his car and slashed her throat in 1990.  Watch the sketch artist's memories of Schuett at 8 » . Years later, Bradford was arrested for a similar crime, court records show. On April 16, 1996, Bradford walked into Gator's Bar in Garland County, Arkansas, and offered to buy a woman a beer. They played pool for a while until she was ready to leave, and he offered her a ride. He wanted to spend more time with her, so he asked if she wanted to ride around in his car for a while and listen to an Ozzy Osbourne tape, the woman told police, the documents show. About 20 to 30 minutes later, he said he wanted to show her some property. According to the court documents, he stopped the car, began choking her and beat her in the head. ""He dragged her from the car into the woods and threw her to the ground,"" according to the court documents. They go on to say that he beat her and choked her again, at one point knocking her unconscious, she told police. He stripped her naked and put a knife to her throat. Bradford told her ""he was going to kill her, that he was going to put the knife in her eye and was going to cut her jugular,"" court documents show. Then, according to the documents, he raped her. He ordered her to stay still, gave her a towel to clean herself up and took her to a nearby creek and helped her finish bathing, court documents said. As they got back into the car and drove toward the Oaklawn Race Track, he said again that he had planned to kill her, the court documents show. This time, she asked him why he didn't. She told police he said he got scared. Bradford began apologizing repeatedly, the victim said, until he stopped the car at the track and let her out. That's when she turned and saw his license plate as he drove off into the distance. When Bradford was arrested in 1996, police took his DNA, which was entered into the FBI database. It remained there for years, until technology would catch up. A Garland County Circuit Court jury found Bradford guilty of kidnapping but was not able reach a verdict on the rape charges. Arkansas corrections officials said Bradford entered prison in march 1997, facing a 12-year-sentence, and was paroled in February 2000. In March 2008, in Houston, Texas, FBI Special Agent Richard Rennison, Dickinson Police Department Detective Tim Cromie and a Galveston sheriff's deputy met to discuss Schuett's 1990 case. Cromie asked if the FBI could see if new methods of DNA testing might help find a match for Schuett's attacker. In July 2008, the evidence from Schuett's attack was sent for analysis, and on September 22, 2009, authorities say they received word there was a match. The FBI lab informed them that the DNA in the attacker's underwear matched Bradford's DNA profile. Bradford was arrested Tuesday morning on his way to work in Arkansas. He appeared in court in Little Rock on Wednesday and waived extradition to Texas. Attorney Mark Jesse, who represented Bradford at the hearing, said plans were in place to fly him to Texas later in the day. Earlier, the FBI said Bradford would arrive in Texas as early as Wednesday night and no later than Friday. Though it may have taken 19 years to find a suspect, Schuett's story came full circle this week with Bradford's arrest. ""I hope that my case will remain as a reminder to all victims of violent crime to never give up hope ... "" she said. ""With determination and by using your voice to speak out, you are capable of anything.""","DNA from suspect in 1996 case leads to arrest in 1990 rape case .

"(CNN) -- Emblazoned on a long, tall, concrete barrier in the midst of a rocky Middle Eastern landscape is this spray-painted message: ""Mirror, mirror on the wall. When will this senseless object fall?"" Messages of peace, marriage proposals and jokes are among the most popular graffiti requests. It's one of more than 900 graffiti messages that have been spray-painted by Palestinians on the controversial wall that separates Israel and the West Bank. The painters take orders through a Web site that lets customers get a message on the wall. For the equivalent of $40, a Palestinian will spray paint the message and send three digital photos of it. Anything goes -- marriage proposals, jokes, notes to friends -- as long as it isn't extremist, hate-filled, or pornographic, said Faris Arouri, one of the founders of the site. ""Trying to imagine a clear view between Palestine and Israel,"" one message reads. ""If all humans are equal, why do they have to live separated?"" says another. And another simply shouts: ""Get along with each other!"" ""This is an alternative way to send your message to whoever you're sending it to,"" Arouri told CNN from Ramallah. ""It is there physically and it will stay there until someone sprays over it or someone decides to demolish that wall ... Hopefully it won't stay forever, because hopefully this wall will be removed sometime soon."" The Israeli government began building the barrier in 2002, about two years after renewed violence erupted in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza. In some areas, it takes the form of a tall concrete wall; in others, it is more of a fence. Israel says the barrier has been successful in preventing terrorist attacks by Palestinians. But Palestinians say it amounts to an illegal land grab of Palestinian territory because it does not match the line of Israel's border with the West Bank before the 1967 Six Day War. The barrier cuts so far into West Bank territory at some points that the West Bank settlement of Alfei Menashe and five Palestinian villages are actually now on the Israeli side of the wall. Palestinians in those villages contend they are cut off from both Israel and the West Bank because they are not allowed to travel into Israel and they must pass through military checkpoints to reach other West Bank villages. The Sendamessage Web site says other families cut off by the barrier are deprived of their livelihoods. The site describes how the wall separated a family from the hotel they owned and kept farmers away from their 500 olive trees. Israel's supreme court has twice ruled that the government must reroute sections of the barrier to avoid infringing on the lives of thousands of Palestinians. Arouri represents a Palestinian non-profit group, the Peace and Freedom Youth Forum, that works on the social and political issues facing young people in the West Bank. About two-thirds of the money raised through the site goes to the group, which uses it to pay for projects like building a playground, buying bicycles, or establishing laundry facilities for university students in Bir Zeit, near Ramallah. The group says it only works with organizations that are legal in the Palestinian territories and allowed to operate by the Israeli government. The rest of the money goes to the group's partners in the Netherlands, who maintain the Web site, accept payments, and manage the paperwork. First conceived at a Dutch-Palestinian workshop in Ramallah two years ago, the site has gone on to attract customers from around the world. There have been 910 orders so far, said Justus van Oel, a Dutch screenwriter who volunteers his time maintaining the site in the Netherlands. Spray-painting on the wall is a peaceful way for Palestinians to protest the barrier, Arouri said. ""You're not only defying the existence of the wall, but you're also showing the international community our refusal, first of all, to such a structure,"" he said. ""Also, it's an attempt to humanize the Palestinian society in the eyes of the world, showing that the Palestinians are not just militants who are violently resisting occupation."" There are other benefits to the project, too, Arouri said. The rest of the world can get a glimpse, however small, into the Palestinians' lives behind the wall -- and the Palestinians get a sense that they're not forgotten, Arouri said. ""There's no big concept,"" van Oel told CNN. ""The wall won't fall because texts are on it, but the people behind the wall, they will have a face. It's also about beauty and poetry. It inspires people."" Poetry is indeed on the wall, as are emotional pleas to take the wall down. Marriage proposals are a frequent order, Arouri said, but so are jokes and funny messages. ""We had a series of obviously French (people) making silly jokes about each other, because the names were just being repeated and repeated,"" he said. ""We also got a message supposedly from a dog, asking the neighbor's dog to come out and play in the sun."" The diversity of the messages is something Arouri says he finds incredible. ""We've covered most of the aspects of human life,"" he said. Caspar Nieuwenhuis, a Dutch theater director, used the site to propose to his girlfriend. His plan was to feature a picture of the spray-painted proposal on a Dutch news broadcast about the wall and make sure his girlfriend, a journalist, was watching -- but the picture never aired. ""Then I thought, well, I have this photo of a Palestinian boy who's writing my proposal on the wall,"" Nieuwenhuis wrote to CNN. ""I've got a notebook (computer). I could save the photo (onto) my desktop and show it to my girlfriend, just that plain and simple. ""So I did. And when she saw this, she said 'yes' and cried,"" he said. Nieuwenhuis said he heard about the site through van Oel, a friend, and liked the idea right away. ""I thought it was a brilliant idea to have something beautiful written on an ugly wall,"" he told CNN. The Sendamessage Foundation is also planning to spray-paint an entire letter written by South African human rights activist Farid Esack next month. It's looking for customers to sponsor a portion of the letter in exchange for having their name signed onto the end. In the letter, Esack compares the situation in the Palestinian territories to South Africa under apartheid, the Web site says.","Web site takes orders for graffiti messages to be sprayed on Israeli barrier .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Diane Sawyer will take over nightly news anchor duties for ABC when Charlie Gibson retires from ""World News"" at the end of this year, a network spokesman confirmed Wednesday. Charlie Gibson and Diane Sawyer worked together on ""Good Morning America."" Sawyer, 63, will be the second woman to be the solo host of an evening newscast for an American broadcast TV network. Sawyer will take the chair in January, ABC's Jeffrey Schneider said. Gibson, 66, and Sawyer worked together for years on ABC's morning show -- ""Good Morning America"" -- before Gibson was promoted over Sawyer to anchor ABC's ""World News"" in May 2006. Elizabeth Vargas and Bob Woodruff co-anchored the newscast before Gibson. That duo came to an end after Woodruff was seriously wounded by a roadside bomb in Iraq. Maria Brennan, president of the Washington-based American Women in Radio and Television organization, called the announcement a ""watershed moment"" and said Sawyer was the ""obvious choice"" to take over ABC's anchor chair. Asked about the significance of two out of three network nightly news anchors being women -- the other being CBS' Katie Couric -- Brennan said, ""It comes with some excitement and some glee for groups like ours, who have worked for years to ensure that women have parity with their male counterparts."" ""When we get to a point in time when we don't even notice the gender, we can really celebrate,"" Brennan said. Sawyer worked for President Richard Nixon in the 1970s, first in his White House press office and later helping him write his memoirs after his resignation. After a stint with CBS News -- including five years as a ""60 Minutes"" correspondent -- Sawyer joined ABC News in 1989. She worked on news magazines for ABC -- including ""Primetime Live"" and ""20/20"" -- before being assigned to co-host ""Good Morning America"" with Gibson in 1999.

Richard and Mayumi Heene and their three sons were featured on the ABC show ""Wife Swap,"" in which the mothers of two often opposite families switch places for two weeks. Mayumi Heene traded places with Karen Martel, whose husband runs a child-proofing business intended to keep children safe, according to a recap posted on Reality TV Magazine. In listing information on the Heene family, ABC's ""Wife Swap"" Web site described them this way: ""When the Heene family aren't chasing storms, they devote their time to scientific experiments that include looking for extraterrestrials and building a research-gathering flying saucer to send into the eye of the storm."" The description of the episode from ABC that appears on the Web site said ""[Martel] is shocked as the Heene kids jump off banisters and run wild, and appalled by Richard's attitude to women."" ""Meanwhile at the Martels', Mayumi Heene sees safety gates everywhere and wonders how the family have fun. She asks the kids about their anxieties and confronts Jay about the climate of fear in his house."" The Heenes reportedly allowed their children to accompany them as they tracked Hurricane Gustav. A YouTube video of the family appearing on Denver, Colorado's KMGH local newscast features two of the Heene sons briefly discussing chasing the Hurricane. ""What my kids learn from these storms and what they walk away with is the fact that these storms can be very deadly,"" Richard Heene told the KMGH reporter. According to the newscast, the family track 30 to 40 weather activities a year. The family was invited back by ABC to appear on the 100th episode of ""Wife Swap,"" where Mayumi Heene switched places with Sheree Silver, a psychic. A Los Angeles Times story documented the show by saying ""The Heene family, with its three rowdy boys, is anchored by father Richard, whose anger arrives in sudden bolts between his fringe science projects."" ""The Silvers, who have two quirky, artistically inclined sons, revolve around the mother, Sheree, who is a psychic and who initially fails to impress Richard. 'Sheree's like a clogged drain, OK? Things aren't happening,' he barks. 'I'll bet you the heaviest thing she lifts is the fork to her mouth.' "" Mayumi Heene reportedly found it difficult on the show to adjust to Silver's household. ""It's their spouses who struggle most,"" the Los Angeles Times story said. ""Richard's wife, Mayumi, finding Sheree's 'househusband,' Sam Castiglia, to be 'a very feminine husband' and finds it tough to even tolerate the quirks of the Silver children, who are so unlike her own, seeming less like a parent than a conspirator against the alien family. So much for learning."" A balloon that was set adrift from the Heenes' Fort Collins, Colorado, home was empty when it landed, and authorities later found one of the Heene sons -- who initially had been thought to be in the balloon -- safe on the ground. Officials said he had been hiding in the attic of the family's garage. What appears to be the three Heene boys are featured in a YouTube rap music video that seems to spoof overprotective parents.","The Heene family of Fort Collins, Colorado, appeared on ""Wife Swap"" twice .

"FALLS CHURCH, Virginia (CNN)  -- Michelle Mack has turned medical thinking upside down. The right side of Michelle Mack's brain rewired itself to take over functions controlled by the left. Born with only half a brain, Mack can speak normally, graduated from high school and has an uncanny knack for dates. At 27, doctors determined that the right side of her brain had essentially rewired itself to make up for function that was likely lost during a pre-birth stroke. But her childhood and young adult years were fraught with frustration. ""It was very hard for me,"" Mack said. ""It was very hard for me growing up. No one knew the truth about my brain."" Mack's parents, Carol and Wally, realized shortly after her birth that something was wrong. ""There wasn't a group to turn to,"" said Carol Mack. ""Michelle didn't have cerebral palsy, I knew that. She didn't have Down's syndrome, I knew that. I had no place to turn."" Ten years ago, Dr. Jordan Grafman, chief of the Cognitive Neuroscience Section at the National Institutes of Health, finally diagnosed the problem.  Watch how Mack's brain healed itself » . An MRI scan revealed she was missing nearly all the left side of her brain. While it was clear Mack has some problems, Grafman said he and the family were shocked by the extent of the damage. ""We were surprised to see the extent of the lesion in her brain, which basically took away the left side of her brain,"" said Grafman. ""There's some very deep structures remaining, but the surface of her brain, the cortex is 95 percent gone and some of the deeper structures, structures that control movement, are missing. These are all structures that are important for movement, behavior, cognition."" The only answer, Grafman said, was that Mack's brain has rewired itself. The remaining half took over some of the essential functions that are normally done by the left, such as speaking and reading. That rewiring, however, came at a cost. ""Michelle has fairly normal language abilities, certainly basic language abilities, she can construct a sentence, she can understand instructions, she can find words when she's talking, but actually she has some trouble in some aspects of visual-spatial processing,"" said Grafman. ""It's quite possible that in her learning, in her development, when the right hemisphere either took over or developed some of the language abilities that it cost her in some of the skills that are normally mediated by the right side of the brain,"" added Grafman. In the 10 years since Grafman first diagnosed Mack, she has seen some intellectual functions improve, the doctor said. Recovery has not been perfect, however. Mack still struggles with abstract concepts and becomes easily lost in unfamiliar surroundings. The diagnosis explained why Mack had experienced a lifetime of difficulty controlling her emotions. ""He's helped us understand the reason why I tend to throw fits, temper tantrums,"" she said. ""It was because I was missing half my brain."" Mack will always have some problems, but dad Wally Mack said that Grafman's diagnosis and treatment answered a lot of questions and gave him hope. ""Dr. Grafman explained that the right hemisphere is taking over, and it might take her a little while longer to get there with all the rewiring that has to take place,"" he said. ""But that told us all these bad days are behind us and there are nothing but good days ahead."" Michelle Mack is now 37 and lives with her mother and father. She works from home doing data entry for her church. She is fairly independent, pays rent and can do most household chores. She realizes she'll need help for the rest of her life but wanted to tell her story to make it clear that she is not helpless. ""I wanted to do this so people like producers, photographers and security guards and police officers learn about people like me,"" she said, ""that I'm normal but have special needs, and that there are a lot people like me, so that they could be more understanding."" CNN's Campbell Brown contributed to this report.","Doctor: Lesion ""basically took away the left side"" of Michelle Mack's brain .

"SEATTLE, Washington (CNN)  -- The FBI wants to question two men who were described as behaving oddly on a Washington state ferry earlier this summer. The FBI wants to speak with these two men seen on a ferry in Washington state earlier this summer. Members of the public and ferry workers reported the men to authorities after the two were seen pacing in areas of the boat, including a cargo hold, as if trying to measure distances, FBI Special Agent Larry Carr said Tuesday. The men were also seen about two months ago taking photographs of the ferries -- including restricted areas -- and studying an emergency evacuation poster. The men were spotted on multiple ferries and ferry routes, Carr said. The FBI wants to question the men to determine if their behavior was harmless or whether they were surveilling the ferries and ferry terminals for nefarious purposes. A ferry worker snapped photos of the men using a cell phone camera and gave the stills to law enforcement. The photos were shown to police and ferry workers, but no one could identify the men, so authorities called on the public for help. Pictures of the men have appeared in media outlets for more than a week. None of the 200 tips that have come in so far has led investigators to the men. Some news organizations have refused to publish the photos, saying the men have not been accused of a crime. It appears the men could be of Middle Eastern origin. Although the initial FBI news release on the men did not discuss their possible ethnicity, ""We just want to ensure that there is just one standard being implemented for suspicious behavior for both people who appear to be Middle Eastern and those who appear not to be Middle Eastern,"" said Naseem Tuffaha of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. Carr said the FBI made the photos public because ""the result of not doing anything at that point in time is a ferry blowing up and thousands of people losing their lives. We can't let that happen."" More than 25,000 people commute daily through the Seattle Ferry Terminal and more than 9 million people travel through the terminal annually, according to the Washington State Department of Transportation web site. But various FBI officials have stressed the agency is acting out of an abundance of caution and that the men seen on the ferry could have a logical and harmless explanation for what they were doing. Robbie Burroughs, also with the FBI in Seattle, said the ferry system could be an attractive target to terrorists. ""Here the ferries are the equivalent of subways, so we are cautious,"" Burroughs said last week when the effort to identify the men began. Since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, U.S. law enforcement has emphasized the need for the public to report suspicious behavior. Many such reports turn out to be nothing of concern. However, seizures of al Qaeda materials overseas have turned up reconnaissance photos taken in the United States. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN)  -- The mayor of a small town in the state of Chihuahua in northern Mexico was found shot dead Tuesday, apparently among the latest victims in the fight against organized crime in the region. Hector Ariel Meixueiro Munoz, 53, was mayor of Namiquipa, a small town in the state of Chihuahua. The body of Hector Ariel Meixueiro Munoz, 53, mayor of Namiquipa, was found inside his SUV on the side of a road on the outskirts of the rural town of 20,000, said Eduardo Esparza, spokesman for the attorney general in the state of Chihuahua. ""He was on his way to work in the morning,"" said Esparza. ""We are still trying to confirm if there was a police escort with him at the time."" The incident has put other officials in the region on alert. Ciudad Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz told CNN during a phone interview that death threats are common in his town on the other side of the Rio Grande from El Paso, Texas. ""It's very sad,"" he said. ""This mayor was fighting crime, he had received several threats, but he was brave. Several of the mayors have received threats and we take them seriously."" Reyes Ferriz said the mayors of the state's large cities have the resources to take sufficient precautions, but for the mayors of smaller towns like Namiquipa, such security is a luxury they often cannot afford. The mayor of Juarez and his family are protected by a 24-hour security detail and are driven in bulletproof vehicles. ""Sadly, this has become part of the process in the fight to regain security in the cities,"" Reyes Ferriz said. Asked whether he feared for his life or those of his family, he would not say. ""All the fears of a public servant are private,"" he answered.","Hector Ariel Meixueiro Munoz, 53, was mayor of Namiquipa in northern Mexico .

"Editor's note: Erica Williams is deputy director of Campus Progress, a project of the Center for American Progress, a Washington-based organization that describes itself as dedicated to progressive causes. She works to engage the millennial generation and communities such as people of color, women and people of faith in the political process. She can be found at ericawilliamsonline.com and on Twitter at @ericawilliamsdc. Erica Williams says the idea that young people don't care about the health care issue is wrong. (CNN) -- As Congress returns to Capitol Hill, back from a recess of contentious town halls on health care reform, one new voice has the potential to break through the seemingly endless deadlock: the voice of young Americans. Just Thursday, there were more than 880,000 Facebook status updates posted with the meme of a demand for health care reform, generated organically and spread virally from young people and other Facebook users across the country. Some are regarding this as the first symbolic demonstration of young people's engagement in the debate despite the common, and categorically false, notion that young people ""don't care about health care reform."" Young adults between the ages of 19 and 29 represent nearly a third of the entire uninsured population, and two-thirds of those uninsured young people reported going without necessary medical care because of costs in 2007, according to research for the Commonwealth Fund. More than half of all young adults have low incomes (below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, $21,660 for a single person in 2009), and low-income young adults are more than 2.5 times as likely to be uninsured as higher-income young adults, according to the Urban Institute. And contrary to popular belief that young people see themselves as invincible college students who choose to remain uninsured, 56 percent of uninsured young adults between the ages of 19 and 29 are full-time workers who are half as likely to be covered by their employer as older workers. Millennials regarded health care reform as one of their top concerns during the 2008 election campaign, according to the Rock the Vote Poll of 18- to 29-year-olds, conducted in February 2008 by Lake Research Partners. Whether it is the 25-year-old freelancer with a pre-existing condition who can't purchase insurance in the individual market, the 20-year-old line cook who doesn't receive insurance through her job or the 28-year-old bank employee who is insured but is worried about the rising costs of premiums, young Americans experience the deficiencies of our health care system on a daily basis. Nevertheless, despite a recent CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey showing that 60 percent of Americans aged 18 to 34 support Obama's reform plan, the voice of young Americans has been strikingly absent from the public, televised national debate. And that silence is a dangerous state of affairs for the larger dialogue around reform. Young Americans have the most at stake and the longest to live with the result, and they are often the primary voice of a moral imperative (the idea that health care reform is not only economically necessary but the just and fair thing to do). Without their voices, the health care reform debate will continue to be stalled and hemmed in by older Americans who are in a better economic position than young people and who are afraid to change the status quo, despite all signs that it is rapidly failing. Young people were such a vital force during the election, not simply because of their own voting turnout but because of their ability to reach out to their elders and persuade them. And what could be more needed now? But if health care reform matters so much to young people and their voice is so crucial in the debate, why the silence? Why does it appear as if young people aren't interested in the debate that will inform so much of their future? Well, if we are gauging America's overall interest in the debate by the aforementioned displays of partisan yelling, screaming and death panel-ing at some town halls, no wonder we think young people don't care. Those sideshows were a clear turnoff to a population that voted overwhelming for less partisanship and ""drama"" in its politics. Or perhaps it is because this administration did little in the early stages of the debate to engage and activate a ""fired-up and ready to go"" base of young people that saw health care reform as a top concern at the polls. Obama rarely highlights the fact that reform would provide protections against price differentials that often result in discrimination based on age and gender. Or what about the fact that the president's reform proposal would mean that a young person can be covered up until the age of 26 by a parent's plan, rather than the current limit of 19 for those who don't attend college? This is what young people should have been told. But it isn't too late. As 2008 showed, young people, like all other constituencies, speak when spoken to. As the debate slogs into what is sure to be the most consequential stage of the battle, President Obama has a prime opportunity to speak directly to those who should have been the base of this issue all along. It is beyond time for the White House, and other organizers working to support reform, to hit college campuses and other community centers where young people can be found, both on- and offline, and empower them to make their voices heard. In the meantime, young people are doing it themselves. Students across the country are beginning to plan their own town hall events and forums, designing health care T-shirts and sending in photo petitions to their elected officials. They are demanding real reform and trying to get the health care debate back on track. In order to succeed, the fight for bold health care reform needs the enthusiasm, support and perspective of young people. And time is running out. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Erica Williams.","Erica Williams: There's a myth that young people don't care about health care .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- More than 35,000 fugitives across the United States were arrested in June as part of an annual sweep that teams the U.S. Marshals Service with local law enforcement in a summer push to clean up the streets, U.S. Marshals said Thursday. U.S. Marshals director John F. Clark says unregistered sex offenders were a major target. Among the 35,190 fugitives apprehended during Operation FALCON (Federal and Local Cops Operating Nationally) were 2,356 fugitive sex offenders, the service said. ""This might be considered the cream of the crop for the most violent felons that are out there. For example, we arrested 433 murder suspects,"" said U.S. Marshals director John F. Clark at a Chicago, Illinois, news conference. In the course of the operation, the marshals also confiscated 582 firearms and 2,400 kilograms of narcotics. ""Often when we find fugitives in hiding, we have other fruits of their crimes: firearms, drugs, some other evidence of some type of criminal activity,"" Clark said. Unregistered sex offenders were a major target, Clark said. ""We highlighted one [case] here in the Chicago area. It involved an individual who was alleged to have molested a 9-year-old girl. He had violated his parole, and after an investigation he was located,"" he said. ""There's evidence of further crimes that happened since he didn't register as a sex offender. This is typical of the type of individual who is out there, somewhere on the streets of America, and is often harming children or others."" One operation involved a Cleveland, Ohio, Police SWAT team and the U.S. Marshals, who were following a lead on Jeremiah Jackson, 29, who was wanted for murder, accused of shooting a woman in the back during a robbery. On June 9, the team surrounded a house where an intelligence surveillance team said Jackson might be. Jackson was reported to be armed and dangerous. But Deputy U.S. Marshal Brian Koerbel said once Jackson saw the team, it had its man. ""When he saw he really had nowhere to go, he gave himself up,"" said Koerbel. ""He made the statement, 'I'm the guy you're looking for and I'll come right down.' "" In Cleveland, Koerbel said, the program was a success. ""We were able to arrest 1,211 people in a 30-day period. Five were for homicides,"" he said. Typically, the U.S. Marshals office in Cleveland arrests about 100 fugitives in any given month. ""This is just the type of operation that brings us all together and shows we're a force of one and shows the community we're here and this is a safe place to raise a family,"" Koerbel said. Jackson was jailed on $10 million bond. He has not entered a plea  on the murder charge, but his father, Willie James Jackson, told CNN affiliate WJW the police have the wrong man.","U.S. marshals team with local law enforcement for annual sweep .

"DOBBS FERRY, New York (CNN) -- Jude Ndambuki teaches high school chemistry, but when he's not in class, you might find him Dumpster diving for discarded computers. Jude Ndambuki's Help Kenya Project provides refurbished computers for Kenyan students. For the past eight years, the Kenya native has been refurbishing computers, printers and other electronic educational resources otherwise headed for landfills, then sending them to grateful students back home. ""The children in Kenya have very few resources; even a pencil is very hard to get,"" said Ndambuki, 51, who lives in the New York City suburb of Dobbs Ferry. ""Being one of the kids who actually experienced very dire poverty in Kenya, I feel any part that I can play to make the life of kids better, I better do it."" In lieu of compensation for the considerable time, expertise and expenses he devotes to his Help Kenya Project, Ndambuki asks that recipients plant 100 trees for every computer they receive. By connecting computer recycling, educational development and environmental conservation, he hopes to encourage a greener, more prosperous future for his country. The Help Kenya Project has provided more than 2,000 refurbished computers to Kenya's schools and planted more than 150,000 trees.  Watch Ndambuki and his Help Kenya Project in action » . ""Many of the schools that I give computers [to] in Kenya have not seen computers before. So we're bringing them closer to the development,"" explained Ndambuki, adding that without this opportunity, some of those schools might have gone another 20 years without touching a computer. ""It's like giving the kids new life,"" he said. ""Computers are getting new life, and trees are being planted to bring a new life, too. It's all connected."" Finding treasure in the trash . ""Growing up was not easy"" for Ndambuki, who said he became a teacher to help children who are struggling the way he did. The second of eight children raised by a widowed mother, Ndambuki attended school at the expense of his older brother; he quit because the family couldn't afford both boys' education. Ndambuki was appointed principal at a Kenya high school where he befriended American exchange students who helped bring him to the United States to further his education. In 1997, he arrived with his wife and two children for his new teaching post in a Dobbs Ferry private school. On a late-night walk home from continuing-education classes, he passed a computer thrown out on the curb for trash collection. He brought it home, where he found it was in perfect working order. It struck Ndambuki that the machines ending up in landfills could offer life-altering opportunities for children in his homeland. ""It all came together,"" recalled Ndambuki. ""Kids in Kenya need to know technology. It's the way of the world, and they will be left behind without it. I am determined to prepare them for office jobs instead of field work."" The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization estimates that 98 percent of Kenya's public primary schools and 80 percent of public high schools lack computers. And 70 percent of Kenya's energy is derived from charcoal and firewood culled from the country's forests, according to the UN Environment Programme. ""There's a lot of trees that are cut every year,"" Ndambuki said. ""We find the land becomes bare, a lot of erosion of the soil takes place. So we need trees to be planted."" The trees also help protect the computers from dust blowing in through the classroom windows, he said. Ndambuki ships a 40-foot container loaded with hundreds of refurbished computers to Kenya for distribution once a year. He and a few of his chemistry students often tinker with computer parts after classes, spending hours refurbishing, packing and preparing the shipments. Each Kenya school receives an average of five computers. To ensure that private data of the computers' former owners is not accessible to new users, the Help Kenya Project wipes that information from the machines, loads them with necessary memory and restores them to functioning order. Every two years, Ndambuki visits recipient schools to show teachers and students the basics of computer programming and maintenance. Some of his American students accompany him and help teach the computer classes.  Watch Ndambuki trade technology for trees in his native Kenya village » . In addition, Ndambuki joins students, teachers and members of their communities to plant trees. ""While I'm doing this project, I feel so much connection with the kids in Kenya,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Colorado say criminal charges are expected to be filed against Richard Heene, a storm-chasing father whose giant Mylar balloon ascended into the sky earlier this week, sparking fears that his 6-year-old was aboard. Richard and Mayumi Heene leave the Larimer County Sheriff's Office Saturday. ""We do anticipate at some point in the future, there will be some criminal charges filed with regards to this incident,"" Larimer County Sheriff Jim Alderden said. The saga captured the nation's attention early Thursday afternoon, after authorities reported the family's homemade helium balloon was set adrift, apparently with young Falcon Heene inside. Since then, speculation has mounted over whether the incident was a hoax by the father, who has appeared with his family on ABC's ""Wife Swap,"" and posted videos of storm chasing and other activities online. Earlier Saturday, in an impromptu press conference outside his home, Heene told reporters the runaway balloon incident was ""absolutely no hoax."" The incident prompted a widespread search in northern Colorado that included law enforcement from several counties, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Colorado National Guard. It ended when Falcon climbed down from the attic above the garage at the family's Fort Collins, Colorado, home. If the incident was a hoax, the only charge local authorities could press would be making a false report to authorities -- a Class 3 misdemeanor, Alderden told reporters Saturday. However, a misdemeanor ""hardly seems serious enough given the circumstances,"" the sheriff said. ""We certainly want to talk to FAA officials and federal officials to see if perhaps there aren't additional federal charges that would be more appropriate in the circumstances than what we're able to do locally,"" he said. He said further details would be disclosed Sunday morning, and that neither Richard nor Mayumi Heene, who came in voluntarily Saturday, was under arrest. The couple emerged Saturday evening from the sheriff's office after several hours of interviews with investigators. ""I was talking to the sheriff's department just now to further things along,"" Richard Heene told reporters outside the building. ""We're doing well."" He refused to take questions before the couple drove away in their minivan. Earlier Saturday, Heene emerged from his house and offered a cardboard box for the media to submit questions.  Watch Heene reveal question box » . ""I got people e-mailing me, calling me; they've got a lot of questions, and I don't know how to quite frankly answer any of them other than I've got a box,"" Heene said around 10 a.m. He said he'd answer the questions later Saturday night. ""I'm going to place the box up front. Please write your questions down,"" he said. ""I have no idea what the news are saying. I don't have cable."" Speculation began to mount over whether the incident was staged after the family appeared on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" on Thursday night. Heene asked Falcon why he had not come out from hiding when his parents were calling for him. ""You guys said we did this for the show,"" the boy said. Heene said his son was confused when he made the ""show"" remark. There were media assembled on the front lawn asking all sorts of questions, and that's what Falcon was referring to, Heene said. Alderden said Friday that -- based on reports that the parents ""took these children into potentially dangerous situations"" with tornado chases, the experimental balloons and other activities -- it would be ""appropriate to involve child protection [services] to at least see what the family situation is and whether the children are in a safe condition."" Earlier, the sheriff told reporters his department contacted child protection officials but asked them not to contact the family until investigators had a chance to re-interview them.","NEW: Criminal charges expected ""sometime in the near future,"" sheriff says .

"(CNN) -- Some issues, it seems, still transcend America's increasingly bitter partisan divide. Ex-President George H.W. Bush and Defense Secretary Robert Gates smile during Obama's speech Friday. President Obama attended a community service forum at Texas A&M University on Friday hosted by one of his Republican predecessors, former President George H.W. Bush. Obama took the opportunity to emphasize that, regardless of partisan politics, the government can only do so much with the challenges facing Americans. ""We face threats to our health, our climate and, of course, our security that have left many of our young people wondering what kind of future they will be leaving for their own kids,"" Obama told the audience, which including the former president and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. ""Anyone here thinks that our government always has the solutions, President Bush and I will be the first to tell you that you'll be sorely disappointed."" ""The government can build the best school, with the best teachers, but we can't run the PTA ... we can pass the most comprehensive health care reform bill, but Congress can't be on the ground in our communities caring for the sick and helping people lead healthy lives."" The two leaders met at Bush's presidential library to celebrate almost two decades of work from the Points of Light Institute, which was founded with Bush's encouragement in 1990 to ""encourage and empower the spirit of service,"" according to the group's Web site. The Institute takes its name from Bush's 1989 inaugural address, where he referenced ""a thousand points of light ... all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the nation, doing good."" Obama lauded the former president's lifetime of service -- from his enlistment at 18 to his community work during retirement -- noting that Bush was the first president to create a White House office devoted to promoting volunteer work. The president said Bush's legacy of service affected the life of his own family. ""It's a vision that's changed lives across this country, including that of a young woman who went to work for an organization called Public Allies to prepare young people for public service careers -- an organization initially funded by the Bush administration,"" Obama said. ""Her experience there inspired her to devote her own life to serving others, and that young woman happens to be my wife, Michelle Obama."" Obama latched onto the community service theme during last year's presidential campaign. He signed a measure in April designed to strengthen national community service efforts by boosting federal funding for thousands of volunteers in fields ranging from clean energy to health care and education. The Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act, renamed to honor the late senator's sponsorship of the measure, will more than triple the number of positions in the AmeriCorps program, from 75,000 to 250,000, by 2017. ""Our government can help to rebuild our economy ... [but] we need Americans willing to mentor our eager young children, or care for the sick, or ease the strains of deployment on our military families,"" Obama said when signing the bill into law. The law created four national service corps and launched several other initiatives, including, among other things, a ""Summer of Service"" program to spur greater community outreach by middle- and high-school students. Older Americans were encouraged to volunteer more through the creation of a ""Silver Scholars"" program, under which individuals 55 and older who perform 350 hours of service receive a $1,000 award. The law increased the existing AmeriCorps educational stipend offered to volunteers to $5,350 -- the same amount as the maximum Pell college grant. Some critics have contended the measure, expected to cost roughly $6 billion over the next five years, is fiscally irresponsible in light of the current economic downturn. They also argue that the concept of volunteerism is undermined by providing financial compensation for community service.

"(CNN) -- The driver who collided with a vehicle driven by Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps will be cited for failure to stop at a red light, police said Friday. Michael Phelps' black Cadillac Escalade collided with another vehicle at an intersection, police say. But the gold medal winner will also be cited -- for failure to present a valid driver's license and for failure to establish a Maryland residency and obtain a Maryland driver's license -- in connection with his involvement Thursday in a car wreck, police said Friday. At the scene, he presented a Michigan driver's license, which police determined ""was not valid,"" said Baltimore, Maryland, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi. Phelps was driving one of two vehicles that collided at an intersection about 9 p.m., Guglielmi said. The female driver of the second vehicle was transported to a local hospital as a precaution, Guglielmi said. Phelps and his two passengers were uninjured. Video from CNN affiliate WBAL showed Phelps' black Cadillac Escalade at the crash site.  Watch wrecked cars at the intersection » . Phelps won a record eight gold medals at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China. Earlier this year, he was suspended from organized competitive swimming after a photo of him holding a bong -- a device commonly used to smoke marijuana -- surfaced in February.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- America's most recent war dead lie in a quiet patch of ground at Arlington National Cemetery known as Section 60. A soldier places flags alongside tombstones at Arlington National Cemetery. In that parcel are 485 men and women who were killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. Most tourists keep to other paths at the cemetery, visiting the Tomb of the Unknowns or President John F. Kennedy's gravesite. However, especially on Memorial Day weekend, relatives and friends pay their respects at the graves in Section 60. ""I wish that everyone in their lifetime could come here at least once,"" said David Christoff of Rossford, Ohio, as he stood where his son is buried. Marine Sgt. David Christoff Jr. died in Iraq two years ago at age 25. As his father's arms swept toward the rows of white granite gravestones, he said, ""You can see the cost of freedom. It's not free, by any means."" ""These are all heroes. This is why we're free today. This is why my son was there."" According to the latest numbers from the Department of Defense, 4,080 U.S. troops have lost their lives in Iraq and 423 in Afghanistan. Arlington is one of more than 100 national cemeteries in the United States where there are military graves. Some families turn down the opportunity to have a loved one buried at Arlington, opting instead to have the grave closer to home. ""It's a hard place to be -- very emotional,"" said Jerry Fowler of Los Altos, California, while visiting the grave of her nephew, Army Sgt. Dale Brehm. He died in Iraq two years ago. ""All these people who lost their lives,"" Fowler said, ""and we just walk by like it's nothing. They meant something."" ""When you walk down these rows,"" she added, ""you learn to respect every single person in this row, not just the person you came to see -- every one."" At least 4 million people visit the cemetery each year, according to its Web site, and officials say Arlington, sadly, is running out of space for graves. There are more than 290,000 bodies buried there. Plans to expand the cemetery include seven areas where urns can hold the ashes of more than 100,000 people. Stepping lightly with heavy boots along the row of graves, Army medic Andrew Harriman of the 82nd Airborne dropped to one knee at several. ""We lost 22 guys from our unit,"" said the soldier, who was wounded in Iraq. He was awarded the Silver Star and Bronze Star for his valor. ""Every time I come to town, I stop by."" Four of Harriman's friends are buried in Section 60. ""I don't think people realize how hard it is for the families and the co-workers or friends of these guys,"" he said. Also buried in Section 60 is Ross Andrew McGinnis of Knox, Pennsylvania. The 19-year-old Army specialist died in Baghdad when he threw himself on a grenade that had been tossed into his Humvee. He saved four fellow soldiers. Next month, McGinnis will be awarded the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest military award, for his bravery. Not far from his resting place is the burial site of Capt. Maria Ines Ortiz, who became the first Army nurse killed in combat since Vietnam when she died in Iraq last year. Particularly touching are the mementos left at some of the graves -- photographs of wives and children, children's drawings, coins, greeting cards, notes, stones and even unopened beer bottles. Nino Livaudes was killed in Iraq in April 2003. At his grave is a multicolored, handmade card bearing the message: ""You are my hero, Daddy. I am 4 years old, and I miss you and love you very much, Grant.""","More than 290,000 veterans are buried at Arlington National Cemetery .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Judge Sonia Sotomayor, who rose from the housing projects of the Bronx to the top of the legal profession, made history Thursday when the Senate confirmed her to become the nation's first Hispanic Supreme Court justice. Sonia Sotomayor, 55, will be the first Hispanic on the Supreme Court. Sotomayor was easily confirmed in a 68-31 vote. Nine Republicans joined a unanimous Democratic caucus in supporting her nomination. Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Massachusetts, supported Sotomayor but was not present for the vote because of illness. Sotomayor, a 55-year-old federal appeals court judge, will be the 111th person to sit on the high court and the third female justice. She will be sworn in at the Supreme Court by Chief Justice John Roberts on Saturday. President Obama, who selected Sotomayor on May 26, said he was ""deeply gratified"" by the Senate vote. ""This is a wonderful day for Judge Sotomayor and her family, but I also think it's a wonderful day for America,"" Obama said at the White House.  Watch Obama's remarks » . Watching the final vote with friends and family at the federal courthouse in Manhattan, Sotomayor was confirmed after senators spent a final day of debate rehashing arguments for and against her. Democrats continued to praised Sotomayor as a fair and impartial jurist with an extraordinary life story. Many Republicans portrayed her as a judicial activist intent on reinterpreting the law to conform with her own liberal political beliefs. Among other things, Republican opponents emphasized concerns over her statements and rulings on hot-button issues such as gun control, affirmative action and property rights.  See how Sotomayor measures up with her new colleagues » . They also raised questions about some of her most controversial speeches and statements, including her hope that a ""wise Latina woman, with the richness of her experiences"" would reach a better conclusion than a white man ""who hasn't lived that life."" Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, helped close the debate by stressing the historic nature of the nomination. ""It is distinctively American to continually refine our union, moving us closer to our ideals. Our union is not yet perfected, but with this confirmation, we will be making progress,"" Leahy said on the Senate floor. ""Years from now, we will remember this time, when we crossed paths with the quintessentially American journey of Sonia Sotomayor, and when our nation took another step forward through this historic confirmation process."" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, took aim at what he claimed was Sotomayor's inability to refrain from bringing her personal political opinions to bear on her rulings. ""This is the most fundamental test for any judge and all the more so for those who would sit on our nation's highest court, where a judge's impulses and preferences are not subject to review. Because I'm not convinced that Judge Sotomayor would keep this commitment, I cannot support her nomination."" Several Republicans, however, bucked party leadership by voting in favor of Sotomayor. Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, announced Thursday morning that he had decided to back Sotomayor after weighing a range of factors, including her education, experience and temperament. ""Judge Sotomayor is not the nominee I would have selected if I were president, but making a nomination is not my role here today,"" Voinovich said. ""My role is to examine her qualifications to determine if she is fit to serve. ... Based on my review of her record, and using these factors, I have determined that Judge Sotomayor meets the criteria to become a justice on the Supreme Court."" Voinovich was joined by Maine's Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe, New Hampshire's Judd Gregg, Indiana's Richard Lugar, Missouri's Kit Bond, Florida's Mel Martinez, South Carolina's Lindsey Graham and Tennessee's Lamar Alexander.  Watch the Senate vote » . In a telling political sign, none of the Republicans who voted for Sotomayor is seeking re-election in 2010. Conservative activists, including the powerful National Rifle Association, mounted a concerted effort to rally GOP opposition to Sotomayor. The abortion issue also played a significant role in the nomination, with abortion-rights supporters backing Sotomayor and opponents urging her defeat. ""Today's historic vote is a sign of progress for Americans who want a Supreme Court that values individual freedom and privacy,"" said Nancy Keenan, head of the group National Abortion Rights Action League Pro-Choice America. Charmaine Yoest, head of Americans United For Life, praised the 31 Republican senators who opposed Sotomayor for a ""stunning vote of 'no confidence' in a nominee whose background of abortion advocacy and record of judicial interventionism raise serious questions about her fitness for the high court."" Underlying the debate over Sotomayor was the larger political question of whether the Republican Party risked alienating Hispanic voters by opposing the first Latina nominee. The party's share of the Hispanic vote dropped sharply in last year's presidential election. ""If you meet all of the challenges that you are told you need to meet and still you can be told no, despite fidelity to Constitution, the law and precedent, then it sends a tough message to us as a community,"" said Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey. Sotomayor's confirmation capped an extraordinary rise from humble beginnings. Her parents came to New York from Puerto Rico during World War II. Her father worked in a factory and didn't speak English. She was born in the Bronx and grew up in a public housing project, not far from the stadium of her favorite team, the New York Yankees. Her father died when she was 9, leaving her mother to raise her and her younger brother. Her mother, whom Sotomayor has described as her biggest inspiration, worked six days a week to care for her and her brother, and instilled in them the value of an education. Sotomayor later graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University and went on to attend Yale Law School, where she was editor of the Yale Law Journal. She worked at nearly every level of the judicial system over a three-decade career before being chosen by President Obama to replace retiring Justice David Souter on the Supreme Court. Accepting the nomination, Sotomayor thanked Obama for ""the most humbling honor of my life."" After the selection, Sotomayor was touted by her supporters as a justice with bipartisan favor and historic appeal. She has served as a judge on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals since 1998. She was named a district judge by President George H.W. Bush in 1992 and was elevated to her current seat by President Clinton. Sotomayor presided over about 450 cases while on the district court. Before her judicial appointments, she was a partner at a private law firm and spent time as an assistant district attorney prosecuting violent crimes.

"(CNN) -- Amanda Knox's parents are hopeful that an Italian court's decision not to re-evaluate the evidence against their daughter means she will be found not guilty of killing her roommate. Edda Mellas and Curt Knox say they have never believed their daughter was guilty. ""We asked for the independent review because we were sure that anybody [who] independently looked at it would support our position,"" Edda Mellas, Knox's mother, told CNN's Larry King in an interview to air Friday night. ""Now, maybe the court decided that they don't even need that support. That our arguments have already been good enough."" Knox, of Seattle, Washington, has been in an Italian jail and on trial for nearly two years on charges that she helped murder her roommate, British student Meredith Kercher. Knox's defense lawyers had asked the court for an independent review of the evidence, which can be requested if there is contested or contradicting evidence. Prosecutors say a kitchen knife, allegedly the murder weapon, has Knox's DNA on the handle and Kercher's DNA on the blade. The defense disputes that, but last Friday, the court denied the request for a review. Closing arguments in the trial are expected at the beginning of November, and Knox's parents hope a verdict will finally vindicate their daughter.  Watch Curt Knox say why he thinks his daughter was arrested » . Her father, Curt Knox, told CNN that he thinks Amanda Knox was targeted as a suspect from the beginning. Within days of Kercher's murder, Knox and her then-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were questioned and portrayed in the media as the undisputed killers. ""I believe that there was a huge mistake made very, very early on by, you know, having a -- literally a 'case closed,' you know, presentation by the police over there,"" he said. Prosecutors held news conferences weeks after the killing, declaring the case solved. Knox, Sollecito and bar owner Patrick Lumumba were believed to have killed Kercher during a sexual game gone horribly awry. Knox was criticized in newspapers and tabloids around the world for her demeanor after the killing, which included photos of her and Sollecito comforting each other as crime scene investigators looked for clues in her house. Knox's mother told King that those headlines couldn't be further from the truth. ""You know, she's very much a person who internalizes,"" Mellas said. ""She was extremely upset, and her roommate testified that when she found out it was Meredith that was killed, she was very upset. She cried; she did all of that. But by the time those photos were taken, it was hours later, and she was being comforted by Raffaele."" As the investigation went on, the scenario of what happened changed. Lumumba was released because he had an airtight alibi, and DNA evidence from the crime scene soon pointed to a different suspect: Rudy Guede. Guede was sentenced to 30 years for the murder in a separate trial and is appealing the verdict. Knox's parents believe that Guede is the sole killer, but because the prosecution hammered the idea that Knox and Sollecito were guilty, they couldn't back away from it. ""They were just too far into it, and they've been trying to press it ever since,"" Curt Knox said. Knox's family and friends insist that the girl they know wouldn't kill anyone. Her parents say they never believed that she was guilty. After the murder, Mellas said, friends and family told Knox to leave Italy -- to either come home or stay with relatives in Germany -- but Knox refused because she wanted to help find the killer and prove that she had nothing to do with it. ""Many people asked her to leave, but she said no. 'I'm going to stay. I'm going to try and help. I'm going to try and finish school,' "" Mellas said. Looking back, her parents wish Knox had left. Now, all they can do is wait -- and hope things turn out how they believe they should. ""We have to believe that what they're hearing in court -- and it's so clear that she had nothing to do with it -- then they'll come out with the right answer,"" Curt Knox said. ""I mean, that's -- that's what we have to believe.""","Knox is on trial in Italy, accused of killing her British roommate, Meredith Kercher .

"(CNN) -- A woman hospitalized after spending time in a sauna-like ""sweatbox"" has died, bringing the total fatalities to three, authorities said late Saturday. Retreat participants spent up to two hours inside the sweatbox, the sheriff's office said. In addition to the deaths, 18 others were injured at the October 8 event at Angel Valley Retreat Center near Sedona, Arizona. The latest victim, Lizabeth Neuman, 49, was a Minnesota mother of three. She died at the Flagstaff Medical Center, the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office said. There were up to 65 visitors, ages 30 to 60, at the resort attending the ""Spiritual Warrior"" program by self-help expert James Arthur Ray, according to authorities. Participants spent up to two hours inside the sweatbox, a dome-like structure covered with tarps and blankets, the sheriff's office said. Hot rocks and water are used to create steam in the enclosed environment. Neuman's attorney, Lou Diesel, told CNN her family is cooperating with the investigation and once it's complete, he will ""take all the appropriate actions in response to those responsible for Liz's death."" Fire and rescue officials received an emergency call from the resort and transported the injured by air and land ambulances to nearby medical facilities, the sheriff's office said. Two people were pronounced dead shortly after arrival at a local medical center. A homicide investigation into the incident is under way, authorities said.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The doctor who implanted six embryos in octuplets' mother Nadya Suleman last year has been expelled from a fertility medical society, a spokesman for the group said. Nadya Suleman gave birth to eight babies after being implanted with six embryos by Dr. Michael Kamrava. Dr. Michael Kamrava demonstrated ""a pattern of behavior that violated the group's standards,"" American Society for Reproductive Medicine spokesman Sean Tipton said. An employee at Kamrava's Beverly Hills, California, clinic -- the West Coast IVF Clinic -- said the doctor would not be commenting on the expulsion. The expulsion, which was imposed last month and just announced, does not affect Kamrava's ability to practice, because affiliation with the professional association is voluntary. Suleman was 33 years old in January 2009 when she gave birth to eight babies. She was a single woman who already had six young children conceived through in-vitro fertilization. The reproductive medicine society recommends no more than two embryos for women under 35 years old and no more than five for women over 40, for whom it is harder to get pregnant, according to guidelines published on its Web site. Suleman, in an interview in February on NBC, said Kamrava told her about risks for the children, but she did not want to have only one or two embryos implanted. ""Of course not, I wanted them all transferred,"" she said. ""Those are my children. And that's what was available and I used them. I took a risk. It's a gamble. It always is."" Two of the six embryos split in utero, resulting in the birth of eight babies. Doctors say giving birth to extreme multiples comes with tremendous risks for the mother and the babies. Risks for the children include bleeding in the brain, intestinal problems, developmental delays and lifelong learning disabilities. Suleman's children, six boys and two girls born nine weeks premature, all went home after an extended stay in the hospital. No indication has been given on whether any problems have emerged. Suleman and her children will star in a ""quasi-reality TV series"" about the family, it was announced in June.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has granted a condemned Georgia inmate's request that his execution be delayed as he attempts to prove his innocence. Troy Davis has always maintained his innocence in the 1989 killing of Officer Mark MacPhail. The inmate, Troy Davis, has gained international support for his long-standing claim that he did not murder a Savannah police officer nearly two decades ago. Justice John Paul Stevens on Monday ordered a federal judge to ""receive testimony and make findings of fact as to whether evidence that could not have been obtained at trial clearly establishes petitioner's innocence."" Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer supported the decision. Sonia Sotomayor, who was sworn in August 8 as the newest member of the high court, did not take part in the petition. Davis' case has had a dramatic series of ups and downs in the past year. He was granted a stay of execution by the Supreme Court two hours before he was to be put to death last fall. A month later, the justices reversed course and allowed the execution to proceed, but a federal appeals court then issued another stay. The high court's latest ruling means Davis will continue to sit on death row. Stevens said the risk of putting a potentially innocent man to death ""provides adequate justification"" for another evidentiary hearing. His supporters in June delivered petitions bearing about 60,000 signatures to Chatham County, Georgia, District Attorney Larry Chisolm, calling for a new trial. Chisolm is the county's first African-American district attorney. Davis is also African-American. Davis has always maintained his innocence in the 1989 killing of Officer Mark MacPhail. Witnesses said Davis, then 19, and two others were harassing a homeless man in a Burger King restaurant parking lot when the off-duty officer arrived to help the man. Witnesses testified at trial that Davis then shot MacPhail twice and fled. But since his 1991 conviction, seven of the nine witnesses against him have recanted their testimony. No physical evidence was presented linking Davis to the killing of the policeman. The Georgia Pardons and Parole Board last year held closed-door hearings and reinterviewed the witnesses and Davis himself. The panel decided against clemency. MacPhail's mother, Annaliese, told CNN at the time, ""This is what we were hoping for, and I hope pretty soon that we will have some peace and start our life, especially my grandchildren -- my grandson and granddaughter. It has overshadowed their lives."" After the justices in October refused to grant a stay of execution, Davis' sister, Martina Correia, told CNN she was ""disgusted"" by the decision. ""It doesn't make any sense,"" she said. ""We are praying for a miracle or some kind of intervention. We will regroup and fight. We will never stop fighting. We just can't be discouraged. The fight is not over till it's over."" Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas objected to the court's decision Monday, calling it a ""fool's errand."" ""Petitioner's claim is a sure loser,"" wrote Scalia. ""Transferring his petition to the [federal] District Court is a confusing exercise that can serve no purpose except to delay the state's execution of its lawful criminal judgment."" Ten days after the high court refused last October to intervene, a federal appeals court in Georgia granted a temporary stay of execution. Since then, further appeals by Davis' legal team have dragged on for nearly a year. Prominent figures ranging from the pope to the musical group Indigo Girls have asked Georgia to grant Davis a new trial. Other supporters include celebrities Susan Sarandon and Harry Belafonte; world leaders such as former President Jimmy Carter and former Archbishop Desmond Tutu; and former and current U.S. lawmakers Bob Barr, Carol Moseley Braun and John Lewis.","Supreme Court's latest ruling means Troy Davis will continue to sit on death row .

"(CNN) -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson ended a trip to the Ivory Coast on Friday, after he spoke to leaders from the nation's political parties and was honored as a prince by a tribe in the West African nation. Jesse Jackson says ceremony to name him a prince of the Agni people was ""very exciting."" Jackson said he met with President Laurent Gbagbo and leading members of two opposition parties, Henri Konan Bedie and Alassane Ouattara. Bedie is a former president of the nation and Ouattara is a former prime minister. Jackson said his mission was not to endorse a candidate, ""but a process."" ""I wanted the three of them to agree ... [to] campaign vigorously ... not to create divisive language, to each agree to support the winner, [and] end the [U.N.] sanctions,"" he said. ""I think there's a common agreement on these points. This country has so much to offer the world and Africa."" The United Nations imposed sanctions on the nation in 2004, among them, a ban on arms and diamond trades, a travel ban and asset freezes for some individuals. The sanctions, renewed last year, are in effect until October 29. Earlier in Jackson's trip, Amon N'Douffou V, king of the Krindjabo kingdom, named Jackson a prince of the Agni people, news reports said. Jackson said it was a ""very exciting ceremony."" Jackson's wife, Jacqueline, suffered a broken leg during the trip when a stage she and her husband were on collapsed, Jackson told CNN in a telephone interview. ""We had excellent medical care,"" the pastor said, adding that the collapse was ""not the fault of the organizers,"" but that too many people had gathered on the stage. Official news agency Agence Ivoirienne de Presse reported that the stage collapse occurred in a sports complex in Yopougon, north of Abidjan. A doctor was to accompany them on their Friday night flight back to the United States, Jackson said. The coming elections in the Ivory Coast are being closely watched by U.N. officials. In a July 30 statement, the U.N. Security Council said ""any postponement of the elections of 29 November would be inconsistent with a credible process"" and with a peace agreement that had followed an armed rebellion in 2002 that had divided the country in two. The Security Council said it would review progress toward elections before October 15. In March, U.S. State Department spokesman Gordon Duguid said the ""United States believes that long-delayed presidential elections are still technically possible in 2009 and calls on all parties to take every step necessary to ensure that credible elections go forward as promised."" The statement said more than 5.7 million people had been enrolled as voters on a ""preliminary basis.""","Coming elections in the Ivory Coast are being closely watched by U.N. officials .

""Our people have been able to establish contact with the people responsible for the abduction,"" said UNAMID spokesman Noureddine Mezni, but he declined to identify the abductors. The organization is ""asking for their immediate release,"" Mezni added. The peacekeeping force began operations in Darfur in December 2007 and is expected to remain there until July 2010, according to UNAMID's Web site. As of July 31 its force is comprised of more than 13,000 troops from 39 countries. As of June 30, 999 international civilian personnel were on staff, according to the site. The United Nations estimates that 300,000 people have been killed in the conflict in Darfur, and 2.5 million have been forced to flee their homes. Sudan denies the death toll is that high. The violence in Darfur erupted in 2003 after rebels began an uprising against the Sudanese government. To counter the rebels, Arab militias with ties to the Sudanese government went from village to village in Darfur, killing, torturing and raping residents there, according to the United Nations, Western governments and human rights organizations. The militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels drew strength.

"(Mental Floss) -- Because you weren't going into botany, the priesthood, or coin manufacturing, you thought you were safe to dismiss Latin as a dead language. Obviously, you didn't graduate cum laude. I think, therefore I am the famous statue ""The Thinker"" by French sculptor Auguste Rodin. Latin is about as dead as Elvis (who, by the way, made $54 million in 2004). Whether you're deciphering a cryptic state seal or trying to impress your Catholic in-laws, knowing some Latin has its advantages. But the operative word here is ""some."" The ability to translate The Aeneid probably isn't going to come in handy anytime soon, so we'll start you off with 9 phrases that have survived the hatchet men of time (in all their pretentious glory). Caveat Emptor:   (KAV-ee-OT emp-TOR): ""Let the buyer beware"" Before money-back guarantees and 20-year warranties, caveat emptor was indispensable advice for the consumer. These days, it'd be more fitting to have it tattooed on the foreheads of used-car salesmen, infomercial actors, and prostitutes. For extra credit points, remember that caveat often makes solo appearances at cocktail parties as a fancy term for a warning or caution. Oh, and just so you know, caveat lector means ""let the reader beware."" Persona Non Grata: (puhr-SOH-nah non GRAH-tah): ""An unacceptable person"" Remember your old college buddy, the one everybody called Chugger? Now picture him at a debutante ball, and you'll start to get a sense of someone with persona non grata status. The term is most commonly used in diplomatic circles to indicate that a person is unwelcome due to ideological differences or a breach of trust. Sometimes, the tag refers to a pariah, a ne'er-do-well, a killjoy, or an interloper, but it's always subjective. Michael Moore was treated as a persona non grata at the Republican National Convention. Bill O'Reilly would experience the same at Burning Man. Habeas Corpus: (HAY-bee-as KOR-pus): ""You have the body"" When you wake up in the New Orleans Parish Prison after a foggy night at Mardi Gras, remember this one. In a nutshell, habeas corpus is what separates us from savages. It's the legal principle that guarantees an inmate the right to appear before a judge in court, so it can be determined whether or not that person is being lawfully imprisoned. It's also one of the cornerstones of the American and British legal systems. Without it, tyrannical and unjust imprisonments would be possible. In situations where national security is at risk, however, habeas corpus can be suspended. Cogito Ergo Sum: (CO-gee-toe ER-go SOME): ""I think, therefore I am"" When all those spirited mental wrestling matches you have about existentialism start growing old (yeah, right!), you can always put an end to the debate with cogito ergo sum. René Descartes, the 17th-century French philosopher, coined the phrase as a means of justifying reality. According to him, nothing in life could be proven except one's thoughts. Well, so he thought, anyway. E Pluribus Unum: (EE PLUR-uh-buhs OOH-nuhm): ""Out of many, one"" Less unique than it sounds, America's original national motto, e pluribus unum, was plagiarized from an ancient recipe for salad dressing. In the 18th century, haughty intellectuals were fond of this phrase. It was the kind of thing gentlemen's magazines would use to describe their year-end editions. But the term made its first appearance in Virgil's poem ""Moretum"" to describe salad dressing. The ingredients, he wrote, would surrender their individual aesthetic when mixed with others to form one unique, homogenous, harmonious, and tasty concoction. As a slogan, it really nailed that whole cultural melting pot thing we were going for. And while it continues to appear on U.S. coins, ""In God We Trust"" came along later (officially in 1956) to share the motto spotlight. Quid Pro Quo: (kwid proh KWOH): ""You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours"" Given that quid pro quo refers to a deal or trade, it's no wonder the Brits nicknamed their almighty pound the ""quid."" And if you give someone some quid, you're going to expect some quo. The phrase often lives in the courtroom, where guilt and innocence are the currency. It's the oil that lubricates our legal system. Something of a quantified value is traded for something of equal value; elements are parted and parceled off until quid pro quo is achieved. Most recently, Arizona Senator John McCain co-opted the phrase to describe campaign finance and influence pedaling because he believes that one doesn't give major milk to a campaign without expecting major cheese in return. Ad Hominem: (ad HAH-mi-nem): ""To attack the man"" In the world of public discourse, ad hominem is a means of attacking one's rhetorical opponent by questioning his or her reputation or expertise rather than sticking to the issue at hand. Translation: Politicians are really good at it. People who resort to ad hominem techniques are usually derided as having a diluted argument or lack of discipline. If pressed, they'll brandish it like a saber and refuse to get back to the heart of the matter. Who said the debate team doesn't have sex appeal? Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam: (ad-MA-yor-em DAY-ee GLOR-ee-um): ""All for the Greater Glory of God"" Ad majorem dei gloriam is often shortened to AMDG. In other words, it's the WWJD of the Jesuits, who've been drilling the mantra into their followers since (Saint) Ignatius of Loyola founded the Catholic Order in 1534. They believe all actions, big or small, should be done with AMDG in mind. Remind your Jesuit-educated buddies of this when they seem to be straying from the path. (Best used with a wink and a hint of irony.) Sui Generis:(SOO-ee JEN-er-is):  ""Of its own genus,"" or ""Unique and unable to classify"" Frank Zappa, the VW Beetle, cheese in a can, that feeling you get when the Red Sox win the World Series: Sui generis refers to something that's so new, so bizarre, or so rare that it defies categorization. Granted, labeling something ""sui generis"" is really just classifying the unclassifiable. But let's not over-think it. Use it at a dinner party to describe Andy Kaufman, and you impress your friends. Use it too often, and you just sound pretentious. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- He armors himself, keeps other people guessing and likes to wear a mask. Christian Bale is known as a hard worker who immerses himself in his characters. Batman? Try Christian Bale. Though in his case the armor and mask are metaphorical, the 34-year-old ""Dark Knight"" star likes to keep his personal life as shadowy as a superhero's back story. He's been known to keep a low profile -- ""You will never see me at a party,"" he told the Times of London -- and delights in concocting stories about his life. ""I make up [things],"" he told Details magazine earlier this year. ""Absolutely. I'm an actor -- I'm not a politician. I always kick myself when I talk too much about family, or personal things. I'll enjoy chatting now and then later I'll regret it."" But with the explosive impact of ""The Dark Knight"" -- the film has set box office records in the 10 days since its release, becoming the fastest film to reach the $300 million mark in history -- and the forthcoming release of the fourth ""Terminator,"" which will star Bale, he may find his privacy limited. (""The Dark Knight"" is a Warner Bros. film. The studio, like CNN, is a unit of Time Warner.) ""Can he stand the glare of the spotlight?"" a rival studio executive asked Entertainment Weekly. ""Being put in major roles and major films?"" Already there are signs that Bale has made the jump from actor to movie star. Last week, news of an alleged hotel-room tussle between the actor, his mother and his sister made headlines around the world. Bale, who has denied the allegations, described the incident as ""a deeply personal matter"" and asked the media to ""respect my privacy in the matter"" at a press conference.  Watch the latest on the incident » . In general, he's been successful at making sure his personal matters are off-limits. Though willing to do interviews about his films -- the Internet is filled with them -- he usually sticks to talking about their production and his performances, reluctant to bring up his personal life. A few facts are well established: Christian Bale was born January 30, 1974, in Wales. His father, a former RAF pilot, once served as a film double for John Wayne; his mother was a one-time circus performer. (After divorcing his mother, Bale's father later married women's-rights advocate Gloria Steinem.) The family moved often, with Bale estimating he lived in 15 different places in his first 15 years. He started his acting career while still a child. He received his first acting break appearing opposite Rowan Atkinson (""Mr. Bean"") in the London stage show ""The Nerd"" in 1984, followed by two British TV miniseries. At 12 he was plucked from 4,000 hopefuls to star in Steven Spielberg's 1987 film ""Empire of the Sun."" (According to the Times of London, he was recommended by Spielberg's then wife, Amy Irving.) Even then he disliked dealing with the press: he abruptly walked out of a Paris press conference for ""Empire"" while promoting the film. ""Empire"" was followed by an eclectic filmography: Kenneth Branagh's Shakespeare adaptation ""Henry V"" (1989); the musical ""Newsies"" (1992); the historical drama ""Swing Kids"" (1993); and the 1994 version of ""Little Women,"" which made him a sex symbol to a group of ""Baleheads."" (He was one of the first stars to have a fan site devoted to him.) Through the latter, he also met his future wife, Sandra Blazic, a onetime assistant to ""Little Women"" star Winona Ryder. The two have been married for eight years, and have a 3-year-old daughter. By the late '90s, he was acting in a number of independent films, including ""Metroland"" (1997), based on a Julian Barnes novel about London yuppies; ""Velvet Goldmine"" (1998), the Todd Haynes film that starred Ewan McGregor and Jonathan Rhys Meyers as early-'70s rockers; and, most infamously, ""American Psycho"" (2000), based on the controversial Bret Easton Ellis novel about a vicious serial killer who hides behind a bland investment banker persona. iReport.com: Your thoughts on 'Dark Knight' Bale has said he was more affected by trying to get the ""Psycho"" part than the role itself. He was strung along -- the studio wanted Leonardo DiCaprio, who was slated for it but walked after contract negotiations broke down -- and put a number of projects on hold while hoping the role would come through. But making the movie, which was given an NC-17 rating by the ratings board for its (often implied) violence and sex -- was fairly easy, he told Entertainment Weekly in 2000. ""I can't say I felt queasy once making this movie. ... I slept really well,"" he told the magazine. ""I played Jesus in this TV thing [NBC's 'Mary, Mother of Jesus'] after doing 'American Psycho' -- I had nightmares the whole time, like I haven't had since I was 10 years old. ... But ['Psycho' character] Patrick Bateman? Nothing."" Since ""American Psycho,"" Bale has become as known for his work ethic as his performances. He dropped 60 pounds for ""The Machinist,"" about a blue-collar worker afflicted with insomnia, and then bulked up again for ""Batman Begins,"" his first go-round at the Batman role. He played a disturbed military veteran in ""Harsh Times"" (2006), investing the role with such intensity that he shocked director David Ayer, and ate worms in ""Rescue Dawn,"" which he made for the equally intense director Werner Herzog. He changes his natural English accent for each role, to the extent of doing publicity in his character's voice. He's said on many occasions that he tries many roles for ""the experience."" But it's ""The Dark Knight"" that has everybody buzzing. In interviews for the movie, Bale has been eager to shine the spotlight on his fellow cast members, notably the late Heath Ledger and co-star Michael Caine, and even his stunt double.  Watch Bale talk about the film and Ledger » . But director Christopher Nolan -- who's now directed Bale in three films (the two Batmans and ""The Prestige"") -- says the actor deserves praise in his own right. ""I knew I wanted to work with him when I saw him in 'American Psycho,' "" he told USA Today. ""You have to be extremely talented to take that kind of absurd violence and make it funny. That's what I wanted for Batman, too."" With ""The Dark Knight"" earning raves and raking in money, Bale would seem to have his pick of future roles. He loves working with Nolan -- he's intimated that he'd sign on for ""Batman 3"" if Nolan's on board -- and doesn't seem to care if the role is for a small-scale indie or a big-budget summer blockbuster. But give people a bigger glimpse of Christian Bale? That's not going to happen if he can help it. Indeed, he takes pride in his anonymity. He told Details of two incidents -- one in which an agent didn't recognize him, another with a casting director who confused him with Christian Slater -- that encouraged him, and told the Los Angeles Times he will continue to make things up to entertain himself during endless movie junkets: ""I have no desire for people to get their facts right about me,"" he said. What finally matters, he told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune while promoting ""The Prestige"" (a film in which he convincingly played a magician), is the work. Acting, he pointed out, has its blessings. ""We're fortunate that it's easy for us to disappear inside our characters,"" he said.","Christian Bale prizes his privacy .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- China's long simmering battle against corruption has come to a boil, this time in Chongqing, the largest megalopolis in the world. A massive crackdown has implicated millionaires, gangsters, and even police officers. Known as ""dahei"" (combat triads), the campaign has put the spotlight on organized crime and how it has infested local bureaucracy and businesses through bribery, extortion, blackmail and violence. The anti-triad campaign in Chongqing is being led by Bo Xilai, the city's party chief. Criminal trials are underway following months of police investigation. Details of murky cases are trickling out. Among those on the dock is Xie Caiping, a portly woman believed be the ""mama san"" of one of Chongqing's notorious triads. Xie is accused of operating gambling dens, drug trafficking, giving and collecting bribes and terrorizing people, including policemen who had tried to investigate her illicit activities. More trials are expected as the city fights at least 14 mafia-style gangs. Given China's opaque political world, it is notable that the ongoing trial is extensively covered by the Chinese media. For years after the Cultural Revolution, Chongqing languished as a decrepit mountain-city in Sichuan province, better known for its spicy food and poor farmers carrying goods on bamboo poles. It became the world's largest city in 1997 when the central government, by administrative edict, incorporated a huge area adjacent to the city into what is now the Chongqing municipality. China's goal was to build up Chongqing into a modern mega-city that will later serve as the new economic engine in central China. Over the years, thanks of the influx of corporate investments and central government funding in infrastructure projects, the city of 31 million has become a center of an economic boom. But the economic boom has also led to the resurgence of local gangs engaged in human and drug trafficking, illegal gambling, prostitution, extortion and protection rackets. Gangsters were blamed for heinous crimes of murder and kidnapping. Local officials were accused of ""economic crimes""-- bribery, profiteering and malversation involving public funds and property. Such abuses have prompted popular anger and social unrest. Communist Party officials are under pressure to clean up or perish. ""The life or death of the party depends on whether or not we have a strong will to punish and prevent corruption,"" Chinese President Hu Jintao told a meeting of the party elite last September. Party leaders pledged to attack the ""acute problems"" of corruption, the gap between the rich and the poor, and the lack of democracy within the party's own ranks. At the meeting, they outlined an anti-corruption directive that would compel officials and their families to disclose their property holdings and investments. ""The new transparency rules are meant to curb abuse of power,"" says political analyst Wenran Jiang. ""It's also aimed at appeasing public discontent over corruption."" In Chongqing, police operations started in June, leading to the arrest of over 4,800 suspected gangsters and the confiscation of 1,700 illegal firearms. Investigations led to many city officials, including police officers. They include Wen Qiang, Xie Caiping's brother-in-law, who is now accused of colluding with gangsters. Highly regarded as an ace investigator, Wen was the deputy police commissioner and head of the city's justice bureau. Last August, he was stripped of his posts, detained and charged of accepting over 100 million yuan in bribes in exchange for giving gangs a ""protective umbrella"". Local media reports say Chongqing residents celebrated Wen's arrest by setting off firecrackers. The ""dahei"" campaign is led by Bo Xilai. 60, the city's party chief who also sits on China's ruling politburo. Son of a revolutionary veteran, Bo had served as Dalian city mayor, Liaoning provincial governor and China's minister of commerce. An outsider in Chongqing, Bo has had to bring in his trusted protégé, Wang Lijun, to replace Wen Qiang as chief of police and clean up the city. Wang made his name as a tough, upright police commissioner in Liaoning province, Bo's former turf. In response, the gangs have reportedly put a 12 million yuan bounty on Wang's head. ""It not us who took the initiative to fight the underworld,"" Bo Xilai told the Chongqing media. ""It's the underworld who has compelled us to do so. The public has been gathering at the gate of our government building, holding blood-stained pictures, deeply distressed. The underworld has killed innocent people with machetes, like butchers killing pigs -- too horrible to see."" Bo said the campaign is aimed at restoring economic order and winning people's trust. Bo's get-tough stance has earned him praises, especially among the Netizens. ""Chongqing's experience should be popularized nationwide,"" wrote a Netizen from the eastern province of Zhejiang. ""Bo should be China's leader in the new era,"" wrote another. Some political observers think success in Chongqing could catapult him as a ""dark horse"" in the next round of political transition, when the next generation of leaders take over in 2012. ""Whatever his motives, the impact is not local but national,"" says Wenran Jiang. ""Clearly, there is public support for such bold actions."" Jiang, who was Bo's college classmate at Peking University in the late 1970s, remembers Bo as ""a smart student of Chinese and world history who always want to do the right thing."" It remains unclear if the current house-cleaning in Chongqing will spread nationwide. Cynics doubt if the Communist Party leaders have the stomach to genuinely root out the evil of corruption wherever investigations find them. ""These crackdowns are like swatting flies while ignoring tigers,"" shrugs a white-collar worker in Beijing. Some see progress. ""At least they realize that the problem is very acute,"" says a government functionary [who asked to remain anonymous]. ""We cannot speak of a harmonious society unless the people are treated equally before the law.""","Anti-corruption drive in Chongqing implicates millionaires, gangsters, police .

"(CNN) -- There are several definitions of where the Northwest Passage begins and ends, but using the Arctic Circle is certainly the most encompassing, so we've been holding our breath until we crossed this line. The crew has negotiated some stunning and treacherous waters to sail the Northwest Passage. The Arctic Circle (66 30N) marks the lowest latitude at which the midnight sun is ever seen. We've had some stormy weather along the Baffin Island coast. We had waves up to 8m high and winds over 40 knots. Silent Sound was being tossed around a lot, and I was thrown clear across the cabin on one occasion, suffering a minor concussion that kept me in my bunk for several days. Now that we're out of the Arctic Archipelago and into the open sea, we are seeing more icebergs, instead of ice floes. Ice floes are frozen seawater while icebergs are chunks of ice broken off glaciers in the High Arctic. Bergs begin as snow falling on land, which is then compressed into ice. Even though the icebergs we see are easily 20 or 30 meters high, most of their volume is below water. Only about one third of their entire volume is visible above water. This means you have to stay well clear of them because they may spread out under water, like an upside down mushroom. We've also started thinking about what we've experienced and learned this summer. By far the most impressive feature of the Arctic has been its people. In every town we visited we met complete strangers who offered us help, welcomed us into their homes and provided us with hot showers and food. So many people showed genuine interest in our journey and generously told us about their lives, and we left nearly every town with a few fish or other wild game in our fridge. Our mission when we left Victoria, British Columbia in June was to find out how climate change is impacting Arctic communities. We saw and heard about the impacts, from slumping land due to the melting of permafrost to hunter stories about the northward migration of species and the challenge that early ice break up poses for transportation. But more importantly, I'm leaving the Arctic with a sense that its communities are at a crossroads. They underwent a rapid change in the 1950s and 60s when people moved off the land and into settlements. Now, those settlements are bracing themselves for unprecedented change due to resource exploration, economic development, political wrangling and an influx of new wealth, people and social forces. They're all tied to climate change in one way or another, and they leave Arctic community leaders with a big job ahead of them. Climate change is turning the spotlight on the Arctic, and hopefully that will mean federal government help where it is needed to aid the Inuit in making wise choices for their future. I've been struck by how although the Arctic is very different place than the urban habitat most of us occupy, it is not in a different time. To maintain a romantic notion of the Arctic as a place time has forgotten where life is simple and basic would be an insult to the people that call it home and be a mistake. Many of the challenges brought to the Arctic by climate change and economic development are the same as those faced around the world. It's just a little colder, and a little more remote. While we've begun mulling over our experiences this summer, it's too soon for the crew of Silent Sound to relax. We are still about three weeks from our final port. And the sailing is getting cold and tiring. The nights are very dark at sea, and temperatures are hovering just above zero degrees Celsius. On many days we are sailing in snow, rain and sleet. Our onboard heater has broken down, so we have to wear extra layers in our sleeping bags to keep warm. This also means that the condensation builds up in the boat and it gets pretty damp, making it hard to dry our socks and gloves. But Halifax is in sight, and we can get some comfort from our accomplishment of completing the Northwest Passage.","Crew of Silent Sound complete the Northwest Passage, heading for Halifax .

"(CNN) -- Afghan opium kills 100,000 people every year worldwide -- more than any other drug -- and the opiate heroin kills five times as many people in NATO countries each year than the eight-year total of NATO troops killed in Afghan combat, the United Nations said Wednesday. An Afghan police officer digs up a field of opium poppies in April. About 15 million people around the world use heroin, opium or morphine, fueling a $65 billion market for the drug and also fueling terrorism and insurgencies: The Taliban raised $450 million to $600 million over the past four years by ""taxing"" opium farmers and traffickers, Antonio Maria Costa, head of the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, said in a report. Not all the money is going into the pockets of rebels or drug dealers; some Afghan officials are making money off the trade as well, he said. ""The Afghan drug economy generates several hundred million dollars per year into evil hands: some with black turbans, some with white collars,"" Costa said. The latter reference is ""to officials in the Afghan administration, federal government of Kabul or the provinces or the army or the police,"" Costa told CNN's Christiane Amanpour.  Watch Costa talk about the problems » . And the problem is spreading, he added. Drug money is funding insurgencies in Central Asia, which has huge energy reserves, Costa said. ""The Silk Route, turned into a heroin route, is carving out a path of death and violence through one of the world's most strategic yet volatile regions,"" he said. Authorities are seizing too little heroin, intercepting only about 20 percent of opiate traffic around the world, according to the U.N. report, ""Addiction, Crime and Insurgency: the Transnational Threat of Afghan Opium."" It comes on the heels of a U.N. warning last month that two years' worth of opium is effectively ""missing,"" probably stockpiled by the Taliban and criminal gangs. More than 12,000 tons of opium, which can be consumed as a narcotic itself or turned into heroin, is unaccounted for, the United Nations estimated in September. It is not clear who has it or why, but the United Nations speculates that criminals could be holding it as a hedge against falling prices or that insurgents or terrorists could be stockpiling it to fund attacks. The latest report claims to be the first systematic attempt to track where Afghan opium ends up.  See how Afghan heroin reaches Europe and the West » . Europe and Russia together consume just under half of the heroin coming out of Afghanistan, the United Nations concluded, and Iran is by far the single largest consumer of Afghan opium. Afghanistan is also probably supplying an increasing share of the heroin in China -- perhaps as much as a quarter, the report said. Afghanistan is by far the world's largest producer of opium, although Laos, Myanmar and Latin America produce small quantities, it said. The United Nations found that Afghanistan may be supplying more heroin to the United States and Canada than had been suspected. The two North American countries consume more than twice as much heroin as Latin America produces. That means either that more Afghan heroin is making its way to North America than had been known or that Mexico and Columbia are producing more than was realized, the United Nations said. The report confirmed an estimate that $400 million in drug profits goes to the Taliban, Costa said. The Taliban ""are deeply involved"" in processing, in protecting farmers and in exporting, he said. The solution ""is very clear,"" he said. ""We need a much greater effort and commitment by governments to prevent drug addiction, to take care of drug addicts ... to reduce demand."" But the popular will for change needs to increase, he said, noting that the Security Council in 2006 and 2007 passed resolutions inviting member states to give the names of drug traffickers to authorities so that their ability to travel can be curtailed and their assets seized. ""So far, much to my dismay, not a single name was provided to the Security Council,"" he said. The report offered little new in the way of possible solutions, said Ethan Nadelmann, founding executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, which promotes alternatives to the war on drugs. ""It's very good at describing a problem,"" he said. ""But it truly is devoid of any kind of pragmatic solution, and it essentially suggests that the answer is to keep doing more of what's failed us in the past."" So long as there is a global demand for opium, there will be a supply, he said. ""If Afghanistan were suddenly wiped out as a producer of opium -- by bad weather or a blight or eradication efforts -- other parts of the world would simply emerge as new producers, ""creating all sorts of new problems,"" he said. And Afghanistan itself would not be helped either, he said. ""You would see in Afghanistan millions of people probably flocking to the cities unable to make a living and probably turning more to the Taliban than they are now,"" he said. He listed three possible options. The first, global legalization and control, ""is not happening, not any time soon,"" he said. The second option is to increase drug treatment for addicts who want it and to provide legal access to the drug, as Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands, England, Spain and Canada have done, he said. ""In all of these places, there are small, growing programs of heroin maintenance that allow addicts to obtain pharmaceutical-grade heroin from legal sources rather than from the black market,"" he said. But Nadelmann added that more people died of opiate overdose last year involving pharmaceutical opiates than died from illegal heroin. A third possibility, he said, would be to view Afghanistan as essentially a red-light zone of global opium production and to think about the solution as a vice-control challenge, ""which means acknowledge that Afghanistan is going to continue to be the world's supplier of illegal opium for the foreseeable future and then focus on manipulating and regulating the market participants, even though it is still illegal."" He added, ""That, I think, is in some respects the de facto strategy, even though it cannot be stated openly, for political reasons.""","Afghan heroin trade funds terrorism, insurgencies, U.N. report says .

"(CNN) -- The Arctic as we know it may soon be a thing of the past. Musk ox in the Arctic check the spread of shrubs to the High Arctic, but promote grass growth. That's the message from Eric Post, lead scientist of a new report into the effects of climate change on life in the Arctic. Published in ""Science"" magazine, Post and his team of international scientist conducted the study during the fourth International Polar Year that ended in 2008. ""It seems no matter where you look -- on the ground, in the air, or in the water -- we're seeing signs of rapid change,"" said Post in a press statement. The report found that flora and fauna of the Arctic are responding in various ways to the region's changes in climate over the last 150 years, and more recently the 20 to 30 years where seasonal minimal sea ice coverage has declined by 45,000 square kilometers per year. With the decline in sea ice and snow, animals usually seen at lower latitudes are being found in more northerly regions, including red foxes that have been displacing native Arctic foxes.  View the gallery of Arctic life affected by climate change » . The report found that some native Arctic species have also benefited from climate change, including wild reindeer on the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard. With less snow cover and a longer growing season, these non-migratory reindeer have taken advantage of the increased plant abundance, with the result that reindeer populations and their ability to reproduce are up, while mortality is down. But other animals are not adapting well to rising temperatures and the effect on delicate ecosystems. Migratory caribou in low Arctic Greenland and elsewhere are declining in number as they have not been able to keep their calving season in synch with changes in plant growth. With the decline in caribou comes a knock-on effect to native Inuit hunters, according to the report's authors. Hotter summers could result in more insects and parasites that prey on the caribou, which could then also reduce the annual caribou harvest by local indigenous peoples. ""Inuit hunters at my study site in Greenland have all but given up on hunting caribou there. What will be the next component to disappear from their traditional lifestyle, a lifestyle that has worked for thousands of years?"" said Post. Iconic Arctic animals dependent sea ice, including Pacific walrus, ringed seal, hooded seal, ivory gull, narwhal and polar bear, are faring especially badly, said the report. The researchers found that polar bears and ringed seals, both of which give birth in lairs or caves under the snow, lose many newborn pups when the lairs collapse in unusually early spring rains. These species may be headed for extinction, said the report.","New study on Arctic changing temperatures finds dramatic changes to region .

"(CNN) -- There is a region of the world where the weather is always hot and humid and it rains almost every day of the year. Sounds predictable, right? But weather in the Intertropical Convergence Zone, or ITCZ, can be volatile and dangerous. Air France Flight 447 went down in a volatile zone along the equator between South America and Africa. The Intertropical Convergence Zone, which circles the Earth near the equator, is where officials say Air France Flight 447 plunged into the Atlantic Ocean. While weather has not been cited as a reason for the plane's crash, the tragedy does call attention to the region. The ITCZ is a belt of low pressure that wraps around the planet. Clouds and storms form along it because it is literally where the winds of the world's hemispheres meet. High pressure in the Northern Hemisphere churns air from the northeast toward the equator. On the flip side, air is steered from the southeast by high pressure in the Southern Hemisphere. The winds that move this air toward the equator are also known as ""trade winds"" and converge in the middle of the tropics. That's where the Intertropical Convergence Zone name comes from. Here, air and water temperatures are typically in the mid-80s. The warm, moist air is heated further by the blazing tropical sun. Steamy air, coming off the ocean, rises until it hits cooler, drier air aloft, forming clouds and thunderstorms. These gigantic storms contain volatile updrafts and downdrafts that can move at speeds of 100 mph. The height of these storms also can tower to more than 10 miles in the air. Even if you stacked two dozen of the world's tallest skyscrapers on top of each other, they still wouldn't reach the tops of the biggest thunderstorms of the ITCZ. Former Air Force meteorologist Tim Vasquez wrote about thunderstorms over the Atlantic at the time of the Air France plane's disappearance on his Web site, weathergraphics.com. ""Based on the infrared satellite imagery, I was able to. . .estimate the altitude of the thunderstorms at around 51,000 feet,"" he told CNN in a phone interview. Vasquez himself has flown through the ITCZ at least half a dozen times. ""I remember flying from Guam to the Philippines, constantly weaving around the thunderstorms. Sometimes, though, pilots are forced to fly through them,"" he said. That's because commercial airliners cannot fly above 50,000 feet. In addition, ITCZ thunderstorms can merge with one another to stretch far and wide, covering hundreds of miles. The crew of Air France Flight 447 reported severe turbulence shortly before the plane disappeared.  How did the plane break into pieces? » . When it's not storming in the ITCZ, the weather can be completely calm, with little to no wind. This stretch of ocean was particularly dreaded by sailors of the 19th century, who named it ""The Doldrums,"" because its lack of wind could leave them stuck at sea, unable to propel forward. Despite these challenges and dangers, planes and ships successfully cross the ITZC every day, thanks in part to technology that has made it easier to see where the thunderstorms are. Here are some commonly asked questions: . Can hurricanes form in the ITCZ? It's extremely rare for a hurricane to form near the equator. However, the ITCZ doesn't stay in one place all year long. In the summer, for example, it drifts more northward, where it's possible for tropical cyclones to develop from the thunderstorms there. What does the ITCZ have to do with the ""monsoon season"" in Asia? Since the position of the ITCZ fluctuates, the location of the heaviest rainfalls varies depending on the time of year. When the zone drifts more northward in May and June, it brings the rainy season to places like Southeast Asia and India. The term ""monsoon"" refers to a seasonal reversal of winds.","Weather in the ITCZ, where the Air France plane went down, is volatile .

"(CNN) -- My taxi driver is telling me about his meal last night. His name is William. He ate whale. Melting world: mountainous icebergs in Greeland's Sermilik Fjord. ""Delicious,"" he says, kissing the tips of his fingers on one hand, making the universal sign for good tasting food. William tells me he went out on a boat with some friends a few days ago and shot the whale. I'm not sure how I feel about this. Welcome to Greenland. On this remote but enormous island subsistence whale hunting is allowed. This was just the memorable start to an extraordinary journey. Cameraman Neil Bennett and I had traveled to the small town of Tasiilaq in southeastern Greenland to meet up with the Arctic Sunrise, a ship belonging to the environmental group Greenpeace. Read Neil's blog on filming in challenging conditions . The 34-year-old icebreaker and its crew are on a three month expedition around Greenland's coast. They say their mission is to help scientists working in the region and to publicize the environmental changes taking place here. We join the Arctic Sunrise as it moves slowly up Sermilik Fjord. This is simply the most beautiful place I've ever seen. It's an inky blue body of water thick with floating, ancient ice. Some of the icebergs are mountainous. They all come from the Greenland ice sheet, a vast mass of frozen fresh water, hundreds of miles across and up to two miles thick.  View the gallery of the stunning landscape » . Over the next four days we observe independent scientists working to understand why the ice sheet is melting so rapidly. We fly over and land on Helheim Glacier, a major outlet for the ice sheet which has sped up dramatically in the last decade. We accompany oceanographers in inflatable boats as they collect data on the warming water currents in the fjord. All this research, they say, points to sea levels rising beyond current predictions. There are still those who question humankind's role in the warming of the Earth's climate, but these scientists are not among them. ""Things could be very bad,"" glaciologist Dr Gordon Hamilton tells me. ""If we don't start to do something about it now we'll very quickly reach a tipping point from which there'll be no return. And the consequences for society as a whole would be catastrophic."" Joining Greenpeace on this expedition was a difficult decision for CNN. Does it compromise our editorial independence on what can still be a highly divisive issue? In my experience it's no different to embedding with soldiers on one side of a military conflict. I've traveled with American soldiers in Iraq and Russian soldiers in Georgia. It enables journalists to access newsworthy locations and people that we couldn't get to otherwise, either practically or safely. And the stories told can still be balanced and fair. Traveling with Greenpeace allowed us to record powerful images of Greenland's accelerating melt. And we met independent scientists who believe the world must act boldly to slow down change that science is struggling to keep pace with.","CNN traveled with Greenpeace to Greenland on their study of the region .

"(CNN) -- Changing winter conditions are causing Scotland's wild Soay sheep to get smaller, according to a study that suggests climate change can trump natural selection. Can't see me now: Climate change could be shrinking Soay sheep in Scotland. The authors of the study published in ""Science"" believe that it highlights how wide-ranging the effects of global climate change can be, adding further complexity to the changes we might expect to see in animal populations in future. ""It's only in the last few years that we've realized that evolution can influence species' physical traits as quickly as ecological changes can. This study addresses one of the major goals of population biology, namely to untangle the ways in which evolutionary and environmental changes influence a species' traits,"" said Andrew Sugden, deputy and international managing editor at Science. The researchers analyzed body-weight measurements and life-history data for the female members of a population of Soay sheep. The sheep live on the island of Hirta in the St. Kilda archipelago of Scotland and have been studied closely since 1985. They selected body size because it is a heritable trait, and because the sheep have, on average, been decreasing in size for the last 25 years. According to the findings lambs are not growing as quickly as they once did as winters have become shorter so do not need to put on as much as weight in the first months of life to survive. The results suggest that the decrease is primarily an ecological response to environmental variation over the last 25 years. Evolutionary change, the report says, has contributed relatively little. ""Sheep are getting smaller. Well, at least the wild Soay sheep living on a remote Scottish island are. But according to classic evolutionary theory, they should have been getting bigger, because larger sheep tend to be more likely to survive and reproduce than smaller ones, and offspring tend to resemble their parents,"" said study author Tim Coulson of Imperial College London. ""Our findings have solved a paradox that has tormented biologists for years -- why predictions did not match observation. Biologists have realized that ecological and evolutionary processes are intricately intertwined, and they now have a way of dissecting out the contribution of each. Unfortunately it is too early to tell whether a warming world will lead to pocket-sized sheep,"" said Coulson.","Study of wild sheep in Scotland suggests climate change making them smaller .

"(CNN) -- As a hobby, Suzie Jirachareonkul, a teacher and mother of two, spends many of her nights searching for endangered toads on the country roads near her home outside Cape Town, South Africa. Volunteers in South Africa are collecting data on the Western Leopard Toad, which is endangered. She often finds them flattened on the street. ""They're so beautiful and it's just really hard to live with, especially when you're living on the road right here,"" the 33-year-old said of the toad deaths. ""So we started doing something about it. We started saving them off the road in the middle of the rain."" When a scientist caught onto her efforts, Jirachareonkul and a friend assembled about 20 volunteers -- a group she calls the ""Toad NUTS"" -- to collect data on the endangered Western Leopard Toad. The information they collect is being used in scientific research. Each time Jirachareonkul comes upon one of the spotted, faintly iridescent creatures, she springs into action. She marks down GPS coordinates, measures the toad, makes notes on its behavior (Is a mate stuck to its back? Is it headed toward a pond?) and uploads the information so scientists can use it. Oh, and she moves the toad out of traffic's way, too. While her nighttime hobby may sound a bit strange, Jirachareonkul is far from alone in her efforts to collect amateur scientific data. At a time when climate change and urbanization are poised to set off a new wave of extinction, some members of the scientific community are turning toward backyard biologists for the data they need to monitor ecosystems and protect struggling species. This ""citizen science"" movement is not exactly new, but it has grown fresh legs as the Internet and social-networking sites help people with uber-specified and often bizarre interests gang up for a cause. Amateur-produced Web sites now serve as data hubs for squirrel sightings, bird photos, ant anthologies, snapshots of leaves, flowers and trees, water quality info, beetle hunts and firefly tracking, among others. Find links at CNN's SciTech blog . ""It's pretty random,"" said Cyndy Parr of the Encyclopedia of Life. ""There's a lot of charismatic things that won't surprise you -- backyard birds, that sort of thing. But there are also thriving communities of people who like to take pictures of butterflies, centipedes, wildflowers, plants."" Some of the sites have sweeping goals. The Encyclopedia of Life, which seeks to gather online information on all known species, has started taking public submissions through a public Flickr group. Some individual users have uploaded more than 2,000 photos. Project BudBurst, out of Boulder, Colorado, aims to collect so much amateur data about plant species that scientists will be able to tell how climate change is altering the seasons in North America. The venture, managed by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, gathers ""data that would not otherwise be collected,"" said Sandra Henderson, the project's director. ""We have these additional sentinel eyes on the landscape, if you will. There aren't enough ecologists to be making all of these different plant observations."" National Science Foundation funding for citizen science dropped off significantly in 2002 but generally has been on the rise since, according to budget numbers compiled for CNN. Since that year, funding in the United States has increased more than 240 percent, to more than $3 million for 2008. Several of the Web projects receive government funding, but others survive on their own merits. In Spain, Josep del Hoyo founded the Internet Bird Collection, an international compilation of bird videos, sounds and photos that's funded solely by his company. He said the intense passion of birders around the world, plus some money from his publishing company, keep the site running. Amateurs have posted video of never-before-seen birds on the site, he said, and some of the work has been the foundation for scientific articles. Technology is amplifying this passion for citizen science, which has been around since scientists started cataloging species. Researchers at several universities are working on iPhone applications and computer programs that could analyze digital photos of plant leaves and automatically identify the plant's species. When those photos -- from ordinary people all over the world -- are paired with the photographer's location and uploaded to a database, the information would be more valuable than anything scientists could come up with on their own, said John Kress, a botanist and research scientist at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. The information could help scientists know if a species is going extinct or dying off in certain regions as the climate warms. Identifying a plant species can be tricky, Kress said, so these technologies also would ensure that nonprofessional data is good enough to use for scientific research. ""When people do these things as citizen scientists you're always a little suspect as to, 'Are you getting it right?' "" he said. ""There's some plants out there that are maples and look like oaks -- and only I would know they're really maples. But with this system we would have a standard way of identifying the accuracy of this information."" Some scientists said they're excited about the trend toward citizen-submitted data because it is impossible for scientists to document all of the changes going on around the world. ""At some point it will really lead to almost a democratization of science, where the amateurs and the volunteers are having just as much of an impact on science as the professionals are,"" said Rick Bonney, who started a citizen science project with the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in 1987. ""It's just going so fast I can't keep up with it anymore."" Others find the movement limited or controversial. The relationship between formal science and citizen science is similar to that between professional news reporters and bloggers; some scientists worry that the information coming in from nonprofessionals will be inaccurate, said John Musinsky, a senior director at Conservation International. The citizen efforts are also limited in the sense that, at least for now, they're largely concentrated in North America and Europe, where there aren't nearly as many plant and animal species as in Latin America and Africa. That's beginning to change, though, said Conrad Savy, a conservation science adviser at Conservation International. ""It's gaining steam,"" he said of the global citizen-science movement. ""It's working very well and it's a great way also to engage the community in conservation issues."" As photo-taking cell phones become more popular in developing countries, a more diverse group will join the efforts, said Kress, the Smithsonian botanist. Jirachareonkul's group devoted to the Western Leopard Toad now works with the South African National Biodiversity Institute to promote understanding of the endangered species. Dr. John Measey, a researcher with the institute, said by e-mail that some research on the toad would be possible without the volunteer efforts. But the ""Toad NUTS"" raise awareness and help scientists ""obtain usable accurate data from a much wider area than we could possibly manage or fund,"" he wrote. When Jirachareonkul started the project, she didn't know much about the toads -- they were just a creature she found squashed in front of her house. Now she has a personal connection to them. She said citizen science is a way for people to connect with their local environment -- and to make a difference. ""There are so many problems in the world, but I think the main problem is that everybody is worried about everybody else's problems that they don't focus in on their little areas,"" she said.","Average people help scientists collect valuable data in era of climate change .

"(CNN) -- Two Americans and an Israeli were awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry on Wednesday for painstakingly mapping out the thousands of atoms that make up the ribosome -- work that paves the way for new antibiotics. U.S. researcher Thomas Steitz is one of three scientists sharing the 2009 Nobel Prize in chemistry. Inside all animals, plants and bacteria are DNA molecules that contain the blueprint for life. Ribosomes are an organism's protein factories. They use the information in the DNA to make the tens of thousands of proteins that enable the organism to function properly. These proteins include hormones, enzymes and hemoglobin, which transports oxygen. From a medicinal standpoint, the ribosome is important because it is what antibiotics target. In a bacterial strain, antibiotics bind to the ribosomes, preventing them from making the proteins the bacteria need to survive. Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz and Israeli Ada Yonath shared the $1.4 million prize for mapping the position of the thousands and thousands of atoms that make up ribosomes. Their three-dimensional models showed how different antibiotics bind to the ribosome. ""These models are now used by scientists in order to develop new antibiotics, directly assisting the saving of lives and decreasing humanity's suffering,"" said the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the prize. Ramakrishnan, a U.S. citizen who was born in India, is a senior scientist and group leader at MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England, according to the Nobel Prize Web site. Steitz is a professor at Yale University and an investigator at Howard Hughes Medical Institute at Yale, the site said.

In ""Curse of the Black Gold: 50 Years of Oil in the Niger Delta,"" Ed Kashi captures the impact of the oil industry on Nigeria's environment and people since it was first discovered five decades ago. Kashi, an American photojournalist, spent three years compiling his photos of the Niger Delta, making a total of five trips to the troubled region. Kashi told CNN: ""It was truly one of the most graphic examples of economic inequity that I have ever seen. Especially with the backdrop of hundreds of billions of oil wealth that has been generated over the previous 50 years."" As a result of his work, Kashi says that his photos are now being used by universities and NGOs to raise awareness to try and effect change. To him, this has been one of the most gratifying and exciting by-products of his work.

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Toward the end of her marriage, Rabia Iqbal said she feared for her life. Robina Niaz said the Quran ""condemns"" abuse of women. ""If we witness injustice, we're required to speak up."" Iqbal was born in New York to parents who had immigrated to the United States from the tribal areas of Pakistan. She had a strict Muslim upbringing and when she was 16, her parents arranged her marriage to a 38-year-old man. She claims her husband turned violent during their 10 years of marriage. When she finally left him, she did not know where to turn. Going home wasn't an option, she said. ""My parents ... made clear that they would disown me,"" Iqbal said. ""My father even said ... 'You're lucky you live in America because if you lived back home, you would have been dead by now.' "" She was hiding out in her office at work when a friend put her in touch with Robina Niaz, whose organization, Turning Point for Women and Families, helps female Muslim abuse victims. ""It was such a relief ... to speak about things that ... I thought no one would understand,"" said Iqbal, who has received counseling from Niaz for more than two years and calls Niaz her ""savior."" ""Robina understood the cultural nuances ... the religious issues,"" Iqbal said.  Watch Iqbal tell her story » . A devout Muslim, Niaz stresses that there is no evidence that domestic violence is more common among Muslim families. ""Abuse happens everywhere,"" said Niaz. ""It cuts across barriers of race, religion, culture."" But, she said, Muslims are often reluctant to confront the issue. ""There's a lot of denial,"" she said. ""It makes it much harder for the victims of abuse to speak out."" When Niaz launched her organization in 2004, it was the first resource of its kind in New York City. Today, her one-woman campaign has expanded into a multifaceted endeavor that is raising awareness about family violence and providing direct services to women in need. Niaz said she firmly believes that domestic violence goes against Islamic teachings, and considers it her religious duty to try to stop abuse from happening. ""Quran condemns abusive behavior of women,"" she said, noting that the prophet Mohammed was never known to have abused women. ""Allah says, 'Stand up against injustice and bear witness, even if it's against your own kin. So if I see injustice being done to women and children, I have to speak up. It's my duty."" Niaz's mission began after a difficult period in her own life. Born and raised in Pakistan, she had earned a master's degree in psychology and had a successful career in international affairs and marketing when she moved to the United States to marry in 1990. ""It was a disastrous marriage,"" she said. As Niaz struggled to navigate the American legal system during her divorce, she said she appreciated how lucky she was to speak English and have an education. She realized that many immigrant women without those advantages might be more likely to stay in marriages because they didn't know how to make the system work for them. ""If this is how difficult it is for me, then what must other immigrant women go through?"" she remembered thinking. After volunteering with South Asian victims of domestic violence, Niaz, who speaks five languages, got a job using those skills to advocate for immigrant women affected by family violence. But Niaz's focus changed on September 11, 2001. ""I was no longer a Pakistani-American ... I looked at myself as a Muslim."" Niaz said the backlash many Muslims experienced after the terror attacks made abuse victims more afraid to seek help; they feared being shunned for bringing negative attention to their community.  Watch Niaz explain the effects of 9/11 on abused Muslim women » . ""Women who were caught in abusive marriages were trapped even more,"" recalled Niaz. In 2004, Niaz used her savings to start Turning Point for Women and Families. Today, her work focuses on three main areas: providing direct services to abused women, raising awareness through outreach, and educating young women -- an effort she hopes will empower future generations to speak out against abuse. Crisis intervention services are a critical element of Niaz's efforts. Through weekly counseling sessions, she and her team provide emotional support to the women while helping them with practical issues, such as finding homeless shelters, matrimonial lawyers, filing police reports or assisting with immigration issues. Niaz has helped more than 200 Muslim women. While most of Turning Point's clients are immigrants, the group helps women from every background. While Niaz has support from many people in New York's Muslim community, she acknowledges that not everyone appreciates her efforts. She keeps her office address confidential and takes precautions to ensure her safety. ""There have been threats ... but that comes with this work,"" she said. ""I know that God is protecting me because I'm doing the right thing."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- It is midday and Geoff Lawton is hard at work at Zaytuna Farms in New South Wales, Australia. But the real work, he says, is going on inside the center of the compost. Geoff Lawton says that permaculture ""revs up"" systems of soil creation. ""There's lots of things breeding in there,"" Lawton says. Compost may not seem a sexy subject, but within this steaming pile, life is being created. ""There's organisms breathing and dying and reproducing very quickly,"" he says. ""It's all very hot and steamy."" That rich soil lays the groundwork for Lawton's revolutionary method of food production. It's called permaculture. Lawton's friend and mentor, Bill Mollison, developed the process back in the 1970s. Since then he and Lawton have traveled the globe preaching the value of permaculture and its aim to create harmony between the landscape and the people who live on it. ""Nature exists in an incredibly rich form, and enriching form and does so without any energy inputs from mankind,"" Lawton explains. ""Permaculture does the same thing."" ""We've taken the systems of soil creation and soil life and we've revved them up. We've speeded up nature itself and we've improved the system.""  Watch Geoff Lawton at work » . So what does it take to improve the system? Lawton says it's about rehabilitating areas that have been damaged by pollution or overuse by recycling nutrients and energy back into the soils. Permaculture also takes all the things we need -- our housing, energy sources, food and water supplies -- and tailors them to fit into the natural rhythms of the ecosystem. The idea is to work with, not against, nature. Lawton says that during the first few weeks and months you don't see the real benefits, but after a year to 18 months you really start to see the difference. ""Within two or three years you can see a system that is really something that's got great opportunities and possibilities,"" he said. The gardens at Zaytuna Farms bear fruit and vegetables of all that hard work. The real measure though isn't how it works, but where. Lawton claims this permaculture method can work anywhere in the world, including the desert. ""Almost all the deserts on earth at one point were forested,"" he said. ""They all have different types of oasis systems. What you're doing is picking different points in the desert and turning them into a rich oasis."" On a DVD created by the Permaculture Research Institute of Australia, Lawton shows us what happened when he took this method to places like Morocco and Jordan -- just 80 kilometers from the Dead Sea. ""People were amazed to see an area that was salty, sandy ground, turn into a lush green forest, that had mushrooms growing from the soil,"" Lawton said. The ability to ""green"" the desert is not only having an impact on the communities where these gardens are grown. Interest is also sprouting among young people. Dozens come to Zaytuna Farms every year to learn about the permaculture method. ""I've only been doing it a year and once you hit upon the principles it's basically observations,"" said intern Jonathan Chan. ""You have to look at the land and which way the wind is blowing and see where the sun angles are and design around that and it does seem quite simple."" For Chan it's as much about cultivating a new way of life as it is about cultivating the land. ""I think people are getting to the point where they have to make change and permaculture is a good direction to go,"" he said. Still, permaculture isn't without its critics. They argue the method is time-consuming in the early stages and that makes the system hard to get off the ground in many places. It can be made even more difficult if the people living around the site aren't familiar with the process. But Lawton argues the time and energy expended in a permaculture garden is offset by the quality of the experience, and the richness of the end result. ""A good organic farmer works a thousand hours a year. The industrial mankind works two thousand to three thousand hours a year. What do we have to show for it? Gadgets. ""We don't have community, we don't have clean water, clean air or sensible housing. As negative as we currently are, we can be equally positive,"" Lawton said. ""It's not just self-reliance or self-sufficiency, it's absolute abundance.""","Geoff Lawton is using renewable natural resources to enrich ecosystems .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Obama huddled with top military, foreign policy and national security advisers Wednesday as part of an ongoing review of U.S. strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan. President Obama and his national security team meet in the White House Situation Room on Wednesday. The meeting, the fifth such gathering in recent weeks, came as the administration continued to weigh a call for as many as 40,000 additional troops in Afghanistan from Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top U.S. commander in that country. McChrystal has said the extra manpower is necessary to implement an effective counterinsurgency strategy. Wednesday's meeting, however, focused on efforts to strengthen the American civilian mission in Afghanistan, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said. Obama also received a report on ongoing efforts to train Afghan security forces, Gibbs added. While McChrystal is pushing for a major troop increase, others in the administration are advocating a different approach. Vice President Joe Biden has called for a counterterrorism strategy, which would focus on using special forces and technology to reduce the number of al Qaeda insurgents on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. ""I will tell you that our principal goal remains to root out al Qaeda and its extremist allies that can launch attacks against the United States or its allies,"" Obama said Tuesday. ""That's our principal mission. We are also obviously interested in stability in the region, and that includes not only Afghanistan but also Pakistan."" Obama has come under intense pressure from several leading senators to follow McChrystal's recommendation, a move vehemently opposed by many liberal Democrats. As Obama huddled with his national security team, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, said he's not ready yet to support sending additional troops to Afghanistan. Hoyer also told reporters he has serious questions about U.S. chances for success in the region and the stability of the Afghan government. ""Afghanistan has not been a successful venue for many great powers in the past,"" Hoyer said. ""I can't think of any. I think we also need to have some degree of confidence that the government in Afghanistan is a viable government that can create confidence within its people. I have reservations about whether that has happened at this point in time."" The majority leader also argued that the situation in Afghanistan can't be viewed in isolation and requires a regional approach that includes Pakistan and India. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said Sunday that any added military deployment that fell short of McChrystal's request ""would be an error of historic proportions."" ""And I think the great danger now is a half-measure, sort of a -- you know, [trying] to please all ends of the political spectrum,"" McCain told CNN's John King. ""I have great sympathy for the president, making the toughest decisions that presidents have to make, but I think he needs to use deliberate speed,"" he said. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, argued that U.S. troops would be put in ""jeopardy"" if Obama does not listen to McChrystal. ""I don't know how you put somebody in who's as crackerjack as Gen. McChrystal, who gives the president very solid recommendations, and not take those recommendations if you're not going to pull out,"" she said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week."" Feinstein heads the Senate Intelligence Committee. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced Wednesday that he is increasing British troop levels in Afghanistan to 9,500, an increase of 500. The British have the second-largest contingent in Afghanistan, after the United States, according to NATO's International Security Assistance Force. Obama announced a plan to send 21,000 additional troops to Afghanistan in March. A total of 65,000 U.S. soldiers are currently serving in the war-torn country. CNN's Richard Greene and Adam Levine contributed to this report.","Gathering focuses on efforts to strengthen civilian mission .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Actress Kelly Preston, whose son Jett Travolta died earlier this year, will talk publicly in October about how she and her husband, actor John Travolta, have dealt with their grief. Kelly Preston is going to speak on a panel titled ""Grief and Resilience"" in October. Preston, 46, will appear on a panel titled ""Grief and Resilience"" at a conference hosted by California first lady Maria Shriver, according to a conference spokeswoman. Jett, 16, was found unconscious on January 2, while on vacation with his family in the Bahamas' West End. He was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival, local police said. The Travolta family has not spoken publicly about the exact cause of Jett's death, but employees of the funeral home that handled the remains said in January the death certificate listed ""seizure"" as the cause of death. The family has remained out of the public eye since his death, only issuing a few written statements. When his latest movie, ""The Taking of Pelham 123,"" was released last month, John Travolta did not take part in the publicity tour to promote the movie, instead issuing a short statement saying his family needed ""additional time to reconcile our loss."" Elizabeth Edwards, the wife of former Sen. John Edwards, and actress Susan St. James will also be on the panel, conference spokeswoman Marissa Moss said. Both women have mourned the loss of sons. The Women's Conference will be in Long Beach, California, in late October, according to its Web site.","Kelly Preston, John Travolta's wife, to address conference on grief .

"(Mental Floss) -- It's Nobel Prize announcement week, and if you had Carol W. Greider, Elizabeth Blackburn, or Jack Szostak in your office pool, you're off to a good start (the trio will share this year's Nobel Prize in Medicine). As we await news of the rest of the winners, here are some stories about past Nobel laureates. Nobel Prize winners receive a medal and a cash award. 1. Robert Lucas, winner of the 1995 Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on the theory of ""rational expectations,"" split his $1 million prize with his ex-wife. If there were a Nobel Prize for Foresight or Timing, she should be nominated, based on a clause in their divorce settlement from seven years earlier: ""Wife shall receive 50 percent of any Nobel Prize."" The clause expired on October 31, 1995. Had Lucas won any year after, he would have kept the whole million. 2. Physicist Lise Meitner, whose work helped lead to the discovery of nuclear fission, was reportedly nominated for the Nobel Prize 13 times without ever winning (though nominations are kept secret, so we don't know for sure). This makes her the Dynasty of the Nobel Prize scene -- that show was nominated for 24 Emmy Awards but never won. Other analogies we'd accept: The Color Purple (11 Oscar nominations in 1985, no wins), the Buffalo Bills or Minnesota Vikings (4 Super Bowl losses each without a victory) and William Jennings Bryan (three-time Democratic nominee for President, losing twice to McKinley and once to Taft.) 3. People who refused the prize: . • Le Duc Tho was awarded the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize with Henry Kissinger for their roles in brokering a Vietnam cease fire at the Paris Peace Accords. Citing the absence of actual peace in Vietnam, Tho declined to accept. • Jean Paul Sartre waved off the 1964 Nobel Prize in Literature. His explanation: ""It is not the same thing if I sign Jean-Paul Sartre or if I sign Jean-Paul Sartre, Nobel Prize winner. A writer must refuse to allow himself to be transformed into an institution, even if it takes place in the most honorable form."" • Afraid of Soviet retribution if he traveled to Stockholm to claim his prize, Boris Pasternak declined to accept the 1958 Prize in Literature, which he'd earned for Doctor Zhivago. The Academy refused his refusal. ""This refusal, of course, in no way alters the validity of the award. There remains only for the Academy, however, to announce with regret that the presentation of the Prize cannot take place."" Yevgeny Pasternak accepted the prize on behalf of his deceased father in 1989. • Swedish poet Erik Axel Karlfeldt won for Literature in 1918. He did not accept because he was Secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the prize. He was given the award posthumously in 1931. This was allowed because the nomination was made before Karlfeldt died -- no candidate may be proposed after death. Mental Floss: 10 technologies we stole from the animal kingdom . 4. In 2007, 90-year-old professor Leonid Hurwicz became the oldest person to ever win (one-third of the Prize in Economics); at 87, writer Doris Lessing became the oldest woman (Literature). 5. DNA expert Kary Mullis -- 1993 winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry -- was scheduled to be a defense witness in O.J. Simpson's murder trial. However, Simpson's lawyer Barry Scheck felt the prosecution's DNA case was already essentially destroyed, and he didn't want Mullis' personal life to distract jurors (he'd expressed an affinity for LSD.) 6. Nobel Laureates you must know: Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., Mother Teresa, Elie Wiesel, Mikhail Gorbachev, Nelson Mandela, Yasser Arafat, Shimon Peres, Yitzhak Rabin, Jimmy Carter, Toni Morrison, William Faulkner, T.S. Eliot, Ernest Hemingway, Samuel Beckett, Pierre & Marie Curie, Max Planck and Albert Einstein. 7. Big names who never won: Dmitri Mendeleev, Leo Tolstoy, Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, Marcel Proust, Mark Twain, Gertrude Stein, Henrik Ibsen, Joan Robinson, Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla, Jules-Henri Poincaré, Raymond Damadian and Mahatma Gandhi. Mental Floss: 6 people who accidentally found a fortune . 8. Winners without the greatest reputations: . • Daniel Carleton Gajdusek, who won in 1976 for his research in human slow-virus infections, spent 19 months in jail after pleading guilty in 1997 to charges of child molestation. • Johannes Fibiger won in 1926 after discovering parasitic worms cause cancer -- a breakthrough that turned out to not be true. • Yasser Arafat shared the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize with Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin. This decision caused Nobel Committee member Kare Kristiansen to resign. ""What consequences will result,"" he asked at the time, ""when a terrorist with such a background is awarded the world's most prestigious prize?"" • William Shockley won for Physics in 1956 for his role in the invention of the semiconductor, but his support of the eugenics movement alienated the scientific community. Shockley also donated sperm to the Repository for Germinal Choice, a sperm bank developed to spread humanity's best genes. 9. As part of his divorce settlement, Einstein's Nobel Prize money went to his ex-wife, Mileva Maric. 10. The Curie family is a Nobel Prize machine, winning five: Pierre and Marie for Physics in 1901; Marie solo for Chemistry in 1911; daughter Irene and her husband Frédéric Joliot-Curie for Chemistry in 1935; and Henry Labouisse, who was married to Pierre and Marie's daughter Eve, accepted on behalf of UNICEF in 1965. 11. Marie Curie's second prize was marred by scandal. Then a widow, Curie had an affair with a married scientist, Paul Langevin -- a former pupil of Pierre Curie. Love letters were involved, eventually leading to a duel between Langevin and the editor of the newspaper that had printed them (no shots were actually fired.) According to NobelPrize.org, when it was suggested that Curie not accept the prize, she wrote a shrewd letter, ""which pointed out that she had been awarded the Prize for her discovery of radium and polonium, and that she could not accept the principle that appreciation of the value of scientific work should be influenced by slander concerning a researcher's private life."" 12. Singing support --While there's no evidence the Nobel judges can be swayed by theme songs, that hasn't stopped Loriana Lana from composing one for Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. ""Peace Can"" includes the lyrics, ""Silvio forever will be / Silvio is reality / Silvio forever! /Silvio gives us trust."" 13. Alfred Nobel -- inventor of dynamite -- may have been inspired to create the Nobel Prize after a premature obituary in a French newspaper called him a ""merchant of death."" 14. Nobel died on December 10, 1896. The formal awards ceremony is held in Stockholm each year on the anniversary of his death. The first awards show took place on December 10, 1901. (These things take time to plan.) And in case you were wondering just how much of a say Alfred Nobel had in the prize, here's what he wrote in his will: . ""The whole of my remaining realizable estate shall be dealt with in the following way: . ""The capital shall be invested by my executors in safe securities and shall constitute a fund, the interest on which shall be annually distributed in the form of prizes to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind. The said interest shall be divided into five equal parts, which shall be apportioned as follows: one part to the person who shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the field of physics; one part to the person who shall have made the most important chemical discovery or improvement; one part to the person who shall have made the most important discovery within the domain of physiology or medicine; one part to the person who shall have produced in the field of literature the most outstanding work of an idealistic tendency; and one part to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity among nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses. ""The prizes for physics and chemistry shall be awarded by the Swedish Academy of Sciences; that for physiological or medical works by the Caroline Institute in Stockholm; that for literature by the Academy in Stockholm; and that for champions of peace by a committee of five persons to be elected by the Norwegian Storting. It is my express wish that in awarding the prizes no consideration whatever shall be given to the nationality of the candidates, so that the most worthy shall receive the prize, whether he be Scandinavian or not.""

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Japan has joined the growing number of major economies that are back in black. Japan's Prime Minister Taro Aso's  $150 billion stimulus helps nation out of recession. Japan's economy grew 3.7 percent on an annualized basis from April to June this year, the first time the world's second largest economy has seen positive growth in 15 months. The announcement of preliminary figures by Japan's Cabinet Office comes after France and Germany surprised economists last week by posting 0.3 percent growth for the second quarter of the year. The news that Japan has rebounded -- the hardest hit of the major economies because of its reliance on exports -- gives economists cautious optimism that the worst of the global recession is over. ""The economy has seen a bottoming out of global demand, which has pushed out net exports ... especially in high tech industries and basic materials, such as chemical, steel and so on because of Chinese demand,"" said Hiromichi Shirakawa, chief economist in Japan for Credit Suisse. Japan's GDP grew just under 1 percent during the three-month period and trade increased 1.6 percent. The uptick marks the end of the worst recession in Japan since the end of World War II. Japan's GDP fell at a record pace during the January-March quarter, when GDP was 15.4 percent lower than the same time period last year. The Japanese economy was buoyed by a historic ¥15 trillion ($150 billion) stimulus package in May, which included unemployment benefits, aid to struggling companies, promotion of green industries and a variety of tax breaks. ""There are many times in the past when tax breaks and fiscal stimulus were offered and failed, but this time around, it worked,"" Shirakawa said. Economists expect GDP to continue modest growth through the rest of the year, especially with an expected rebound in global auto sales this quarter. But whether the recovery can continue into the new year after the stimulus package runs its course remains a question. ""Japan's economy still is quite sensitive to global demand ... and for consumer demand to grow on a self-sustained basis still seems unlikely,"" Shirakawa said.","Japan's economy grows by 3.7 percent on an annualized basis .
