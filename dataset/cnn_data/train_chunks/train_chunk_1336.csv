"After years of cutting back in the wake of the worst recession in living memory, it seems we have started spoiling ourselves again. This year saw families splash out more on eating in restaurants and going on holiday, according to analysis of our spending habits. The improving economy has helped bolster confidence and encouraged Britons to ‘shake off the shackles of the downturn’, according to Barclaycard which carried out the research. Scroll down for video . After years of cutting back in the wake of the worst recession in living memory, it seems Britons have started spoiling ourselves again, spending more on eating in restaurants and going on holiday . Spending on travel rose 4 per cent, on airlines 3.2 per cent and hotels, 6.4 per cent; those who stayed at home prompted an 8 per cent rise in DIY spending . Spending on eating out jumped the most in 2014, while people spent significantly less on petrol . However, we haven’t entirely forgotten the dark days of the financial crisis, which started seven years ago. Households have become more financially savvy by cutting back on the weekly shop to pay for more leisure activities, the analysis found. This year spending on restaurants grew 14.6 per cent, while our bills for entertainment – including drinking in pubs and going to the cinema and concerts – jumped 11.3 per cent. Consumers snapped up more gadgets, parting with 6.4 per cent more in electronics stores. Spending on travel rose 4 per cent, on airlines 3.2 per cent and hotels, 6.4 per cent. Those who stayed at home prompted an 8 per cent rise in DIY spending. Families are balancing the books by cutting back on essentials, according to Barclaycard, which said the desire to seek out a bargain has become more ‘entrenched’ since the crisis. Spending on food and drink grew just 2.1 per cent – less than any other category – and consumers forked out 1.8 per cent more in supermarkets, which the analysis attributed to shoppers ‘squeezing the best value from essential purchases’. Britons haven’t entirely forgotten the dark days of the financial crisis, which started seven years ago, with households now becoming more financially savvy by cutting back on the weekly shop, the analysis found . It suggests thrifty consumers are also making the most of a supermarket price war, in which the big names have slashed their prices to compete with discounters Aldi and Lidl. Shoppers are also ditching the big weekly supermarket shop. Consumers spent 6.5 per cent less every time they went to the supermarket but made 8.9 per cent more purchases. And this trend applies to shopping generally, as households adopt a little and often approach. The average amount spent per transaction has fallen by 3.7 per cent this year, but the number of purchases increased 7.4 per cent. The plummeting price of petrol, driven by the slump in the cost of oil, is helping keep more cash in consumers’ pockets. Prices have dropped from 130.79p a litre to 114.07p, according to the AA, while the Barclaycard figures show spending on petrol has dropped 5.5 per cent this year. Valerie Soranno Keating, chief executive of Barclaycard, hailed a ‘steady recovery in consumer spending’. ‘Greater confidence in the future, stemming from an improving economic backdrop, continued falls in unemployment, lower inflation and discounting by retailers have all tempted consumers to part with more of their money,’ she said. ‘Despite increased confidence, the value-seeking behaviour that we saw take hold in the tough economic times has become entrenched and we’ve seen consumers responsibly balancing the books by cutting back in one area to spend in another. ‘I suspect it’s a behaviour we’ll continue to see until meaningful wage growth.’ There are signs that this is starting to happen. Figures released last week show regular pay grew 1.6 per cent in the year to October, while inflation fell to 1 per cent – its lowest level for 12 years.","Britons are cutting back on the weekly shop to pay for entertainment .

"A shooting which left a young man dead and another seriously injured as they sat in a car could have been a ‘targeted attack’, police said tonight. The 22-year-old who died was the passenger in a Ford Mondeo car which was stationary at traffic lights in Sheffield city centre when it was attacked last night, South Yorkshire Police said. Officers said he suffered fatal injuries when he was shot at from the passenger side of the vehicle on the A61 Derek Dooley Way, near its junction with the Sheffield Parkway, at around 10.15pm. Scroll down for video . Police at the scene where a 22-year-old man was shot dead and another injured in a gun attack last night . The driver, a 28-year-old man, was seriously injured and is in hospital in a stable condition. Detective Chief Inspector Phil Etheridge, who is leading the probe, said: ‘From the information we currently have, we believe there is a possibility this was a targeted attack against the two victims. ‘However it is too early in the investigation to confirm at this stage. Inquiries are ongoing at this time and officers will remain in the area today to provide reassurance to people. ‘I’d like to appeal to anyone who may have witnessed the incident, or anyone who has information, to please come forward and contact police.’ Mr Etheridge said formal identification and a post-mortem examination have not yet taken place. Both men are from the Sheffield area. No one has been arrested. The shooting happened at one of the busiest road junctions in Sheffield, where the Parkway - the main route into the city from the M1 - meets the Inner Ring Road. Mourners attend the scene this morning. Those working nearby said they were shocked by the shooting . Police are appealing for information from anyone who was in the area at the time of the shooting . Next to where the shooting took place is office of professional services company, Capita, where employees arriving at work this morning described their shock at the tragedy. Tom Horley, 29, said: 'I just turned up at work this morning and saw it all cordoned off. It's a bit of a scary thing to arrive at work to on a Monday morning, it's not what you expect to see. 'It's sad to hear of someone losing their life so close to Christmas. I hope the other guy pulls through.' Kate Norman, 26, said: 'I heard about it on the news and realised where it had happened was right outside where I work. I didn't really believe it until I turned up here and saw a load police cars outside. 'I can't really believe it, it's a real shock. We're all completely gobsmacked this could happen. It's the sort of thing you see on films, not outside where you work.' Police are hunting the killer after the two men, both from Sheffield, were shot in a stationary vehicle . This morning a small area of road in front of Capita’s landmark Hartshead House building, a five-minute walk from the city centre, remained sealed off. Two lanes of the Parkway were closed to traffic overnight but, by daybreak, most of the lane closures had been lifted and by this morning traffic in the area was returning to normal. Officers in vans and police cars were watching a short stretch of coned-off road at the end of Derek Dooley Way, outside the Capita building. A small area of the Parkway, a few hundred yards away, was also coned off. But there were no signs of any active investigation at the scene and the car targeted in the shooting had been removed. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, MP for Sheffield Hallam, said the shooting was a ‘tragedy’ and urged anyone with information to talk to the police. Sections of the road were closed this morning as police continue to investigate the late-night shooting . In a message on Twitter, Mr Clegg said: ‘Shocked to hear what happened in Sheffield. Any loss of life is a tragedy. I hope those with info will do all they can to help the police.’ Other city residents also took to Twitter this morning to express their shock at the killing. One wrote: 'Thoughts go out to the families of the two shot young men on Sheffield Parkway. Was eerie driving down there this morning - can't believe it.' Another added: 'Just seen the shocking news that a man has been shot dead in #Sheffield Prayers for those grieving his death.' Officers have urged anyone with information to contact police or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.","Ford Mondeo was shot at in Sheffield shortly after 10pm last night .

"A couple had to be pulled out of mudflats by a crew in an RAF helicopter after they got stuck while walking their dog. Charlotte Lomas and boyfriend Luke had not realised they had strayed onto the mudflats in East Mersea in Essex until they found themselves waist-deep in mud and unable to move. They had tried to pull each other out of the mud before they got stuck and were forced to call 999 for help as it began to get dark. Scroll down for video . A couple and their dog had to be winched to safety from mudflats in Essex after they strayed onto mudflats while walking the animal and then found themselves stuck waist-deep in the mud at the country park . Eight rescue teams - including a crew in an RAF helicopter - were called to rescue the struggling couple. The pair were walking Charlotte's greyhound, Chip, at Cudmore Grove Country Park, East Mersea, when they found themselves in a grassy area and began to get stuck in the mud. Miss Lomas, from Bicknacre, Essex, tried to help her boyfriend, but ended up getting stuck herself. She said: 'We had never taken Chip to Mersea before. 'We walked from the car park along the coastline and it led to an area we thought was just grass. We didn't realise it was the mud flats. 'Luke went across first but got stuck. Within a couple of minutes the mud was up to his thigh. 'I was trying to pull him out but then I got stuck from where I was trying to pull him. 'We were trying for about 45 minutes before we called 999. We were shouting for help. No one could see us and it started to get dark.' Charlotte Lomas and boyfriend Luke (left) got stuck in the mudflats while they walked her eight year old dog . Essex Police sent a rescue team and helicopter to the scene along with seven other teams who were called at about 3.45pm on Saturday to help save the terrified pair. Chip, eight, was not stuck, but was found lying down waiting close to the couple - who were wedged in the mud by the time crews arrived. PC Shaun Hammond was first on the scene because he knew the area well and suspected where the trio would be. Several rescue crews were sent to help the couple, including a team in an RAF helicopter to pull them out . Miss Lomas was rescued first and was strapped to a RAF crew member so she could be freed from the mud. The crews comforted Miss Lomas' 24-year-old boyfriend who had mud almost up to his waist at the time . Miss Lomas' boyfriend, clutching Chip, was then strapped to the rescuer and both were hauled from the mud . The Mersea coastguard team, fire fighters, ambulance crews and the RAF Sea King helicopter also arrived on scene. The RAF helicopter winched the pair to safety but they did not need to go to hospital. In total, the emergency response teams and vehicles called to the scene were; an ambulance, an ambulance officer, a rapid response car and a hazardous area response team, one fire engine from Mersea, and the fire service's urban search and rescue boat, police officers in patrol cars and a helicopter, the RAF Sea King helicopter and coastguards. The couple (left) were covered in mud up to their knees and waist but were treated by paramedics at the scene and did not need to go to hospital, Chip (right) did not get stuck but laid down near his owners . Charlotte, a theatre assistant at Chelmsford's Broomfield Hospital, praised PC Hammond because without his knowledge it would have taken far longer to find them. She said: 'We cannot thank everyone enough. 'We have managed to get the addresses of everyone who helped and we are going to send letters to say thank you so much and for the speed at which they found us.'","Charlotte Lomas and boyfriend Luke were walking her dog in Essex park .

"You're a mean one, Mr.Grinch. A California couple say a real-life Grinch stole Christmas from their autistic son. Surveillance footage captures a man taking seven packages containing presents from Chuck and Colleen Saftler's Los Angeles home's porch Friday afternoon, according to CBS Los Angeles. Around 3.30pm, a man is seen driving up the Saftler's driveway in a silver car, he unlatches the Saftler's fence and begins loading the packages from the porch in to the car. Scroll down for video . Jackson: A thief was caught on camera Friday stealing Christmas presents from the home of Jackson, an autistic teen (photographed) Mailbox: Jackson checks the mailbox religiously each day, waiting for a gift that already came -- and went . The man, wearing dark pants and a gray, hooded sweatshirt then drives away. CBS reports that the suspect followed a UPS truck who stopped at the family's home, the man then circled the block and returned to the Saftler's home to steal their packages. The family notified the police and Chuck, an FX Networks executive, even took to Twitter and Facebook, posting the surveillance footage, enlisting the help of the public to identify the man and save his son's Christmas. Though the thief took several presents from the Saftler's porch, Colleen and Chuck are most concerned about one.

Packages: The thief steals seven packages containing Christmas presents from the porch .

For the last three years, their autistic son Jackson has asked for one thing for Christmas: the Disney Collection CD’s Volumes 1-4.

'It seems silly because it’s just a CD but to him it’s everything and this is all he wants and all he asked for and it’s not too much to ask for him to get something he wants for Christmas,' Colleen told CBS. 'It’s not fair.' Colleen and Chuck say they just want the CD back for their son.

"Hundreds of families feared they would be left without Christmas turkeys, drinks and party food after computer problems hit three major supermarkets. Customers across Britain were left angry and frustrated when the glitch affected online orders of festive groceries from Waitrose, Sainsbury’s and Asda. With households rushing to stock up for the holiday season, scores of orders at Waitrose could not be assembled, bagged and delivered after a four-hour computer crash on Sunday morning. Sainsbury's customers were outraged when allocated delivery slots booked weeks in advance were scrapped, with the retailer's website crashing for half an hour . At Sainsbury’s, a website error left some shoppers struggling to book or change their orders, while Asda customers complained that deliveries had been cancelled without warning. The problems come as today was predicted to be Britain’s busiest shopping day of the year – and as a report reveals the soaring number of high street stores in ‘significant’ financial distress. After the supermarket IT issues at the weekend, angry shoppers went on Twitter to complain about the poor service and a lack of information. Waitrose customer Paul May complained of ‘appalling’ service. He tweeted: ‘No delivery last night, no call to say it wasn’t calling – no call today to rearrange – Xmas stuff missing.’ Fiona Turner posted yesterday: ‘Still waiting for my Christmas shop since 8pm last night. Not impressed as now have to sort out the shop with a 6month old!” Asda shopper Patrick Harper stated: 'Entire food delivery for our Christmas holiday just cancelled by Asda but they can deliver... on the 29th! Shocking service.’ Asda customer Justine Webster tweeted: ‘A problem with your website has cancelled my order and delivery for tomorrow! I could cry' Matt Richardson said: ‘Sainsbury's have let us down 100 per cent. Delivery slot booked two weeks ago - Sainsbury's make a unilateral decision to delete our order. Merry Xmas!' Nadine Gibbs wrote: ‘@waitrose you cancel my Xmas food shop (inclusive of turkey) no notice and no one answering the phone to resolve. So angry, 3 days b4 Xmas.’ The Sainsbury’s glitch affected customers between 9.20pm and 9.50pm on Sunday night – with some saying their orders disappeared entirely. The average woman will buy presents for 16 people this Christmas – but men pick up just three, according to a study. While women buy gifts for husbands, children, parents, grandparents, in-laws, friends, colleagues and neighbours, men’s lists tend to be limited to wives, fathers and the office Secret Santa. The poll of 2,000 people, by beauty website feelunique.com, found 38 per cent of men admit they buy only one present – for their wife – as she sorts the rest. Men also tend to prefer online shopping to the high street. Vikki Fuller, from Frimley, Surrey, said she lost her order despite booking a delivery slot three weeks ago and now has to visit the store for her Christmas shopping. Emma Mottram, from South East London, said she panicked when the website crashed, leaving her unable to access it. Asda customer Patrick Harper tweeted: ‘Entire food delivery for our Christmas holiday just cancelled by @asda but they can deliver... on the 29th! Shocking service.’ Another, Anne Gregory, added: ‘Terrible customer service, they’ve taken my money and left us with no food!’ Waitrose said the number of customers involved was in the low hundreds, Sainsbury’s said fewer than 100 of its orders were affected, while Asda said around 40 of its customers had problems. However, Waitrose said it was now ‘back on track’ with orders. Sainsbury’s said its ‘brief technical issue’ had been fixed, adding: ‘We would like to reassure all customers who have orders outstanding that they will receive their deliveries before Christmas.’ And Asda said: ‘We have been reinstating these orders as a priority today so no-one will miss out on their Asda order, and we’re also giving them a gesture of goodwill to say sorry for the inconvenience.’ Meanwhile, research reveals the financial difficulties faced by high street stores. Busy day: Shoppers on Oxford Street in central London today. Visa Europe expects some £1.3billion to be spent using its cards tomorrow . Despite Black Friday sales giving a boost to major brands such as Amazon and John Lewis, some 24,251 retailers are in ‘significant’ distress – an increase of 54 per cent from 15,792 a year ago. The change is even more marked among clothing stores, with the number in significant distress rising by 123 per cent from 666 to 1,482. Forget the latest toy. It seems what many children really want for Christmas this year is ... their own private bathroom. Almost one in five British parents said their youngsters had asked for an ensuite as a present, according to a survey. And, of course, it was mainly teenagers who wanted more privacy – with the gift most popular among those aged 13 to 18. Jenny Smith, of bathroom company Ideal Standard, which – unsurprisingly – carried out the survey, said: ‘Kids have seen how an ensuite means not competing with parents or siblings to get in there in the morning.’ There was a 70 per cent rise among food retailers, from 2,243 to 3,819, according to the survey by business experts Begbies Traynor. Its report said thrifty consumers had slashed their Christmas spending and were holding out for bargains. It said: ‘While Black Friday provided a short-term boost, retailers have failed to convince shoppers to part with their cash this festive season, causing the number of struggling businesses in the sector to increase considerably.’ Researchers calculated ‘distress’ by looking at factors including the number of county court judgments against firms, how much cash was in the bank, debts and rent bills. Today is expected to be the busiest high street shopping day of the year – with Visa expecting £1.3billion to be spent on its cards, the equivalent of £15,278 every second. However, separate figures show that the number of shoppers visiting high streets has fallen. On Saturday, there were 6.6 per cent fewer than the equivalent day in 2013, said credit experts Experian.

"The SNP is on course to take a leading role in the Government of the whole of the UK after a poll showed a record number of Scottish voters plan to back the party. Almost half of all voters north of the border now say they will support the Scottish Nationalists at the general election – prompting speculation that Alex Salmond could become deputy prime minister in a coalition administration. The SNP is on course to win as many as 54 of the 59 Scottish constituencies, a result which would mean it holding the balance of power at Westminster. Scroll down for video . Almost half of voters in Scotland say they will support the SNP at the general election – prompting speculation that Alex Salmond (left) could become deputy prime minister, while the collapse of Labour's traditional support north of the border has not been halted by new leader Jim Murphy (right) A record 48 per cent of Scottish voters are now planning to back the SNP in May - with Labour trailing on just 24 per cent . An extraordinary collapse in Labour’s traditional support in Scotland has not been halted by the election of a new leader, former Cabinet minister Jim Murphy, earlier this month. A Survation poll for the Daily Record newspaper found that 48 per cent of voters now say they will back the SNP next May – its highest ever predicted vote share in Westminster elections from the pollster. Labour is on course to get only 24 per cent, the Conservatives 16 per cent, the Liberal Democrats 5 per cent and Ukip 4 per cent. That would mean the loss of as many as 39 of Labour’s 41 Westminster seats in Scotland – a result which would scupper Ed Miliband’s hopes of entering No 10 with a Commons majority. Instead, the Labour leader would be left having to bargain with Mr Salmond, who is to stand for a Westminster seat, the Gordon constituency in Aberdeenshire, in May. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has overseen a surge in support for the SNP since taking over from Alex Salmond . Mr Salmond stepped down as Scotland’s First Minister after losing the independence referendum in September. The SNP could end up in a position of power over the entire UK – an unthinkable outcome months after its referendum defeat. Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader and the new First Minister, said the poll was a ‘great early Christmas present’. Labour leader Ed Miliband could be deprived of a Commons majority if new Murphy fails to turn around the party's dire poll ratings . She added: ‘We take absolutely nothing for granted – and the hard work begins in the new year to ensure that we achieve a strong group of SNP MPs to give Scotland the strongest possible voice at Westminster. ‘That way, we can use our influence to bring an end to austerity economics, make Scotland free of Trident nuclear weapons, and get the powers Scotland needs to build a fairer society and more prosperous economy.’ The SNP’s campaign director, Angus Robertson MP, added: ‘The poll shows that Jim Murphy has had a “reverse honeymoon” as leader of Labour in Scotland – with the SNP stretching our lead even further since he took up the post. On these figures, Labour would even lose Mr Murphy’s seat.’ Mr Murphy insisted Scottish Labour was ‘changing’. He added: ‘We are one week into a new leadership team and really determined to change. ‘During the referendum Scotland was divided between Yes or No. But in the general election most Scots will be united in wanting to get David Cameron out of Downing Street.’ Polls currently indicate that British voters are set to return a hung parliament for the second election in succession. There are increasing fears in Whitehall that the election could produce an effective dead heat between the main parties – with only a ‘rainbow coalition’ made up of three or more parties able to govern. The SNP has indicated that in such circumstances, it would not prop up a Conservative-led government – but could offer support to Labour in return for a series of costly concessions. Mr Salmond has already suggested his MPs are prepared to start influencing English laws on a ‘vote by vote’ basis to prop up a Labour government.","Some 48% of Scottish voters are now planning to back the SNP in May .

"Islamic State is kidnapping thousands of women and young girls to be traded in open markets as sex slaves for as little as £16 each, it was revealed today. A shocking report by Amnesty International lays bare for the first time the true depth of depravity with which IS fighters are treating their female captives, tearing them from their families and subjecting them to sustained and violent rape and domestic enslavement. Puberty is not requisite to be an IS sex slave, with girls as young as 12 and their mothers being dragged by their hair  onto cattle trucks and herded to a 'sorting office' where they are classified by age, education and marital status, The Times reported. Scroll down for videos . Lucky ones: Displaced people from the minority Yazidi sect, fleeing violence from forces loyal to the Islamic State in Sinjar town, walk towards the Syrian border, on the outskirts of Sinjar mountain . Appauling: Puberty is not requisite to be an IS sex slave, with girls as young as 12 and their mothers being dragged by their hair onto cattle trucks and herded to a 'sorting office' where they are classified by age, education and marital status . After being abducted from their homes, they are sold as playthings to the highest bidder, usually IS commanders, or gifted to the 'bravest' fighters as rewards for their services to jihad. What happens to them thereafter is up to their new owners who are free to abuse, torture, rape or just share them between their friends. These are not isolated examples of individual cruelty but an institutionalized policy of wholesale enslavement based on a brutal interpretation of Sharia law. Horrific details of the barbarity with which  IS treats its captives are only now beginning to trickle out thanks to the bravery of a minority of girls who escaped their captors and fled to safety to tell their stories. Those stories have now been published in Amnesty's report, Torture, sexual slavery in Islamic State captivity in Iraq. Activists are desperately trying to shine a light on the plight of these slaves who hail primarily from Iraq's minority Yazidi population. And they say the IS slave drivers include Islamic converts from the West. 'I have a case of one escapee who was one of a group of girls bought and raped by two Australian brothers from Isis,' Amena Saeed, a Yazidi former MP, told The Times. 'These were not Australians of Islamic origin - these are white-skinned, blond-haired Australians: converts.' The Times spoke to a number of escapees who all told stories of gang rape and horror. Rewarded: After being abducted from their homes, they are sold as playthings to the highest bidder, usually IS commanders, or gifted to the 'bravest' fighters as rewards for their services to jihad . Terror: What happens to them thereafter is up to their new owners who are free to abuse, torture, rape or just share them between their friends . They include a 19-year-old Yazidi woman who recalled the moment she and her sisters were seized from the town of Sinjar, northern Iraq, prized from their mother's grasp and sold to a man they knew  from their village. 'My mother started screaming and begging for mercy as the Daesh (Isis) fighters told my sister and me to join the group of younger women specially selected,' Girl B, as she has been named to protect her identity, said. 'But they tore us from her grasp. I saw other women in the building being dragged to waiting lorries by their hair.' Girl B and her 14-year-old sister were captured on the first Sunday of August as they fled up Sinjar mountain to escape the advancing IS horde. But before they could reach the safety of the hills they were intercepted and driven to a government building in Sinjar where the selection process began. Of the men who captured her, her mother, sister and  six siblings, the youngest of whom is 11 years old, she said: 'They were local Sunni fighters, some of whom we recognised. A local mechanic was among them.' She said she and her 14-year-old sister were ordered to join a group of both married and unmarried young women. 'When my mother realised (what was happening0 she began screaming,' she said. Her mother managed to hold on to her 11-year-old daughter but could not prevent Girl B and her sister being taken away. Girl B said they were piled onto lorries 'like cattle' and taken to Mosul where they were held in another sorting centre, named Galaxy Hall. Horrific: Details of the barbarity with which IS treats its captives are only now beginning to trickle out thanks to the bravery of a minority of girls who escaped their captors and fled to safety to tell their stories . Over the following two weeks, they went though another two selection processes before they ended up with about 100 other girls in a house in the town of Baaj owned by an influential IS sheik. They were also forced to convert to Islam. They were inspected once more before she was sold to another man she knew called Abu Ghuffram, a small-time crook in her hometown who fitted gold teeth to clients including, once, one of her older sisters. She and her sister were then taken to his home in Rambussi where they would serve - both sexually and domestically - him and two of his captains. 'Sometimes he would call me by name and talk reasonably,' she said 'At other times the men would insult our Yazidi faith and curse us. If Abu Ghuffram was angry, he would strike of kick me. Once he put his hands around my throat and tried to choke me.' That was all she could bring herself to tell The Times before she broke down under the strain of her trauma. It was then that a Yazidi care worker told the newspaper's reporter that the girls had been repeatedly raped over a long period by Ghouffram and his underlings. They managed to escape in November - three months after their initial capture - by sneaking past a sleeping guard at night and climbing over a wall. They walked through the night through the desert and into the Sinjar mountains where they were found by Yazidi fighters who evacuated them to Dohuk by helicopter. Islamic State have long denied using sex slaves to services its fighters. But, in October, the terror group published an article on its propaganda page stating that the enslavement of captured Yazidis was justified because they are a 'pagan minority'. It went on: 'Enslaving the families of the kuffar (non-believers) and taking their women as concubines is a firmly established aspect of the Sharia.' And earlier this month, in its 'Questions and Answers on Taking Captives and Slaves', Isis said: 'It is permissible to have intercourse with the female slave who hasn't reached puberty if she is fit for intercourse.' Activists say some 2,500 girls and women have been captured as sex slaves in the past five months. so far, about 430 have escaped. About 2,000 Yazidi men are also unaccounted for, believed to have been executed. Khider Domle, a Yazidi activist helping refugees in Dohuk said: 'We have raped and pregnant cases; children who have escaped without parents; parents without children. We have cases of women who have been raped by just one Daesh fighter, and cases of women who have been multiply raped and sold several times among Isis fighters. We have found women sold for $25 (£16), for $100 (£64), for $1,000 (£640). We have it all.' Girl B has not seen her mother or father since that August day when they were torn apart by Isis fighters.","Girls as young as 12 being dragged by hair onto cattle trucks to be slaves .

Ebanks, of Bromley, south London, was arrested at Portsmouth International Port on October 18 last year after he was found with 52kg of high-purity cocaine. The benefit of the conspiracy was £2,068,140 to Ebanks and £1,946,839 to West, but a confiscation hearing was told the available amount from each man was a nominal sum of only £10. The drugs, brought over from Spain, had a street value of between £4.8 million and £10.4 million. Ebanks was initially sentenced to 15 years in jail at Portsmouth Crown Court for conspiracy to fraudulently evade the prohibition on the importation of cocaine between April 2011 and October 2012. Meanwhile, West, from Purley, south London, received a 14-year jail term for conspiracy to import cocaine. However, Ebanks had his sentence increased to 20 years, while West had his increased to 19 years at the Court of Appeal in London last month. The cocaine was being smuggled hidden in crates of recycled rubber, which Ebanks claimed was for resale to tyre companies. Ebanks had denied taking part in the conspiracy, saying he had been duped by others. But a jury found him guilty of the charge following a trial. Portsmouth Crown Court heard Ebanks had made several trips to Malaga to organise the import of the drugs, and had made repeated journeys to a remote farm in West Sussex where the drugs were stored. Meanwhile, West pleaded guilty to his role in the conspiracy. Portsmouth Crown Court heard Ebanks had made several trips to Malaga to organise the import of the drugs, and had made repeated journeys to a remote farm in West Sussex where the drugs were stored . Recorder John Trevaskis ordered that Ebanks and West should each serve an extra one day in prison if they do not pay the full £10 within the next 28 days. After the original sentencing at Portsmouth Crown Court in July, John Locke, Senior Crown Prosecutor for the Complex Casework Unit of the Crown Prosecution Service had said he hoped their 'ill-gotten gains' could be 'confiscated'. He said: 'Their criminal enterprise ended on 18 October 2012, when UK Border Agency officials intercepted a lorry and trailer arriving at Portsmouth International Port from Caen, France. 'A total of 52 packages of cocaine were retrieved from three of the pallets, weighing in excess of 52 kilograms. 'Of those bags that have been tested, the drugs have been assessed as having a purity of between 67 per cent and 91 per cent. 'If these drugs had been in circulation on the streets, one can imagine the damage it would have created and the numbers of criminal activities it would have generated. 'We will now be looking at confiscating their ill-gotten assets.'","Michael Ebanks, 33, and Mark West, 37, admit conspiracy to smuggle drugs .

"Most impalas run for their lives at the sight of a leopard but this plucky youngster snuck in for an affectionate embrace instead. The unlikely friendship between the hunter and its prey was captured in the Kruger National Park in South Africa. The impala nuzzles the big cat's nose and mouth, and even when its new friend gets a little rough, it shows no signs of running off. Scroll down for video . Unlikely friends: The leopard places a paw on the impala in a seemingly gentle sign of affection in South Africa . I'm ignoring you: The impala tries to get the leopards attention at the Kruger National Park . It started with a kiss: The impala nuzzles in under the leopards jaw and rubs up against his big cat chum . The encounter was filmed by game ranger Estiaan Houy, 31, while out on safari with British and American guests. He said: 'In all my years of being a game ranger I have never seen such an encounter, nor do I ever expect to see a repeat of it again. 'I felt amazed and honoured to see such a rare and unexplainable sighting. 'The impala at no stage showed any signs of distress or fear. Every time the leopard would playfully interact with the baby impala, it would return to the leopard and either sniff its face or push its head against the leopard's face. 'A few times the impala would jump away from the leopard and, true to cat form, the leopard would pull it back closer with its claws.' Mr Houy said young leopards sometimes play with their prey due to a lack of killing experience, and believes this may explain the odd encounter. I'm just trying to scratch: The leopard uses its rear paw to scratch its neck as the friendly impala closes in . Eye spy: Something catches the leopards attention to the left as the impala looks on . Game ranger Estiaan Houy who spotted the encounter said in all his years on the job he had never spotted such as unlikely friendship and said he never expects to 'see a repeat of it again' Catch me if you can: Cuddle time over, the impala decides to stretch its legs, which intrigues the leopard . You've got no chance: As the impala gathers some speed the big cat makes a hasty turn in pursuit . Two on one: Another leopard joins the fun as the trio run together across a clearing in the park . He added: 'Although this appears to be play, only the leopard was actually playing and not the impala. 'The impala rubbed faces with the leopard because it's a newborn and doesn't know any better. 'The leopard could have been waiting for the baby's mother to return and then kill her.' Houy, who works for Jock Safari Lodge, says the amiable interaction lasted for an hour before the leopard lazily strolled into a bush, closely followed by the impala. Down you go: The leopard places a paw on the impala's back, gnetly nudging it to the ground . Meal mates: The impala looks set to become the big cats lunch, but the rough play is all in the name of fun . Just chilling: Having had a run, the leopards and the impala take a rest, but William Fox from INGWE Leopard Research said while the pictures may suggest the leopards had made a friend, they were just doing what many big cats do, 'it is playing with its prey' William Fox, the senior project manager from INGWE Leopard Research said: 'The leopard is just doing what leopards do and like many cats, it is playing with its prey. 'I've seen similar things before, when just like a domestic cat, which may bring a mouse home and play with i), this leopard is just playing around before the inevitable. 'As much as it would be nice to think predator and prey became buddies, the instances of vegetarian leopards are non existent, so the end result is very likely to not have ended well for the Impala.' It is not known what happened afterwards - but sadly it is likely the friendship only lasted until dinnertime.","The unlikely friendship was formed at South Africa's Kruger National Park .

"Petrol prices are plummeting towards the one dollar per litre mark just in time for the Christmas holiday season. The national average for petrol prices is currently $1.21 per litre with prices as low as $1.09 in Sydney on Tuesday. The last time motorists saw the average petrol price in Australia drop below a dollar was back in 2005 between February 14-20, the Australian Financial Review reports. 'If we don't get to a dollar, we will get very close to it,' NRMA spokesman Peter Khoury said. Scroll down for video .

A price war between cheap petrol in America and Arab countries in OPEC is behind the  price fall. Despite the slump in oil prices, companies in Australia are not using the recent drop  to inflate petrol prices for consumers. 'With Coles and Woolies setting their price at $1.14, I can't see the independents putting their prices up any time soon,' Mr Khoury said. 'I think like the rest of the country, the NRMA would be over the moon about sub-one dollar petrol. NRMA spokesman Peter Khoury said if petrol prices don't get below a dollar, 'we will get very close to it' It comes as the NRMA's director Alan Evans called on petrol companies to pass on savings that are currently being seen in Sydney, with petrol still more expensive in Brisbane, Canberra, Darwin and Tasmania. The average petrol price in Sydney last Friday was $1.16 per litre. 'The supermarkets and their associated oil companies should be Santa Claus and not Scrooge to Canberra motorists,' Mr Evans said. 'A large supermarket chain has capped prices in the Sydney metropolitan area at $1.14 or less until 4 January next year while independent retailers are offering regular unleaded in Sydney as low as $1.12 per litre. 'We would to see the petrol companies extend this Christmas gift.' A price war between cheap petrol in America and Arab countries in OPEC is behind the price fall . The drop in fuel prices equates to an annualised $2.5 billion reduction in household expenses since October, according to figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

"A 158-year-old giant redwood in the grounds of a historic estate has been hailed as the 'oldest living Christmas tree in Britain' by English Heritage. The 100ft tree has not been used as a festive decoration in decades, but at one time it was uprooted every Christmas and brought indoors to light up the halls of a Grade I-listed mansion. It was planted in the grounds of Wrest Park near Silsoe, Bedfordshire, by Thomas de Grey in 1856 – meaning it would have been one of the first introduced in this country. After growing too large to be brought inside, it stood forgotten in the extensive grounds for decades until English Heritage gardeners rediscovered its surprising past. A 158-year-old giant redwood  has been hailed as the 'oldest living Christmas tree in Britain', pictured (left) as it appeared in the June 1900 edition of Gardeners' Chronicle . The  English Heritage team at Wrest Park have now restored  some festive cheer to the tree with the help of a cherry picker and a 3ft star. Visitors to the park in December will also be asked help decorate the lower branches with traditional ribbons. The gardeners found a reference to the now 30m tree in the June 1900 edition of the Gardner's Chronicle periodical. 'It is said to have been planted by the late Mr Snow in 1856, and must therefore have been one of the first introduced into this country,' the article stated. The English Heritage Team have decorated the giant Christmas tree for the first time in decades . After growing too large to be brought inside it stood forgotten in the extensive grounds at Wrest Park, Bedfordshire, for decades . 'Mr Ford, the late gardener at Wrest Park ... has carried the plant many times from the conservatory to the mansion, and vice versa.' John Watkins, English Heritage's Head of Gardens and Landscape, said: 'The Christmas tree at Wrest Park is a rare, documented example of a tree that was decorated and replanted annually during the Victorian period. 'It was planted shortly after the trend for Christmas trees began and we believe it is one of the earliest examples. 'If anyone knows of an earlier one, we'd like to hear about it. The team at Wrest Park are delighted to restore the tree's festive cheer this December by decorating it for the first time in more than a century.' The tree is a giant redwood (Sequoiadendron giganteum), indigenous to parts of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. In 1853, a British plant collector named William Lobb brought a few redwood seeds to England and the gardeners at Wrest Park must have been among the lucky few to acquire one of these seeds. Christmas trees were introduced during the reign of Queen Victoria by Prince Albert, who had enjoyed this tradition throughout his childhood in Germany. From the mid-19th century, families would bring trees in from their garden during the festive period and adorn them with candles, sweets and homemade decorations. 'Christmas trees were the height of festive fashion by the 1850s after being adopted by the royal family as part of their celebrations,' said Mr Watkins. English Heritage is now inviting people to come forward if they know of any earlier living Christmas tree in Britain to determine whether the Wrest Park giant is truly the oldest. Visitors to the park in December will also be asked help decorate the lower branches with traditional ribbons .

"The day before Brodie Smith died he told his girlfriend he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her. But before he could propose, the West Australian man died while on a trip to take Ibogaine - a 'miracle' cure for his drug addiction, reportedly ice, derived from an African plant that tribes use as a hallucinogen. Mr Smith died on Ko Phangan - an island in the Gulf of Thailand - as his girlfriend, Kara Spark, watched helplessly as he stopped breathing, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Brodie Smith, from Mandurah, died on Ko Phangan - an island in the Gulf of Thailand - as his girlfriend, Kara Spark, watched helplessly as he stopped breathing . They were in Thailand to get treatment for Mr Smith's drug addiction and were planning the rest of their lives together. Just 24 hours before he died, the man from Mandurah, Western Australia, told Ms Spark he was going to propose to her. Ms Spark said her boyfriend died after ingesting Ibogaine - a hallucinogenic drug from Africa . 'The night before was the most amazing, he said he was going to propose, it was the best feeling I've ever felt, I would say yes, I wanted nothing more then to marry you,' Ms Spark wrote on Facebook. 'I knew Brodie was the one... I've honestly never been happier. 'We celebrated, made plans for ""Brand New"" tattoos, this was meant to be a new beginning for Brodie and myself.' Ms Spark said they exchanged vows of love and he 'held me in his arms' that night. But these dreams were shattered when the couple went to the Ibogaine Thailand retreat on October 20. This is where Mr Smith started a treatment program that cost $5,300 and would take place over four days. There are conflicting reports about the circumstances of Mr Smith's death. Ms Spark told Fairfax Media they he was administered his first dose of the African plant at 8.30pm. The plant has been classed by the World Health Assembly as likely to cause harm to humans, and has been identified as having psychedelic and psychoactive properties. Ms Spark claims Mr Smith was given another dose of Ibogaine at 9am the next day. More than two hours later Ms Spark claims Mr Smith was told to take two blue-coloured tablets which was meant to be Valium and make him drowsy. But she claims it all went wrong when Ms Spark said her boyfriend was short of breath 20 minutes later. The hallucinogenic is part of a program to treat drug addiction in Thailand's Ko Phangan island . Ms Spark's (pictured with Mr Smith, right) Facebook is filled with tributes to her 'soulmate' Thongnaipab Beach, Ko Phangan, in Thailand, where the couple were staying when Mr Smith allegedly took Ibogane and died . 'Then he stopped breathing. He was staring at me with his eyes wide open,' Ms Spark said. She then tried to revive him but was unsuccessful in trying to bring him back to consciousness. The director of the Ko Phangan treatment centre Mike Picone told Fairfax Media Mr Smith was never given Ibogaine. Mr Picone claims Mr Smith was battling a methamphetamine addiction and as part of the treatment program he had to be clean for at least five days before he could start taking ibogaine. He said the Australian died in his hotel room after he overdosed 'from injecting illegal narcotics' that Mr Smith brought into Thailand from home. 'After he died his girlfriend, Kara, produced a freshly used syringe and gave it to the police as she was reporting to them that he had shot up in the shower and overdosed,' the director said. The Mandurah man died after he stopped breathing. Ms Spark said she tried to revive him but was not successful .

Ms Spark denies Mr Picone's version of the events surrounding her boyfriend's death.

'All my hopes, dreams were shattered and now become impossible,' Ms Spark said. 'I love you so much Brodie Noel Smith with every single part of me.' On her Facebook page dedicated to Mr Smith, Ms Spark wrote she would 'fight to death for justice' as his family calls for a inquest into his death and the use of ibogaine. His mother, Dianne Tucker, said she never wanted what happened to her son to be repeated. 'The parents of anyone with an addiction problem have usually been to hell and back, dealing with all the traumas that come with drug use,' she said.","Kara Spark, from Mandurah in WA, claims her boyfriend died after taking ibogaine in Thailand .

"A young female prison officer who exchanged love letters containing 'sexual innuendos' with two inmates, including a murderer serving a life sentence, has been jailed. Syndi Baker, who is from a family of prison guards, forged close relationships with two male prisoners at work and then kept in touch with them through letters. She was exposed after police were called in following an internal investigation into the 25-year-old's conduct, after a prisoner alluded to the pair having a sexual relationship. A search of her bedroom led to a number of letters being found, which showed she was in contact with a man she had met during the course of her job, who was jailed for life in 2009 for murder. Prisoner officer Syndi Baker was sentenced to 12 months in prison for breach of a trusted position after her suggestive love letters to two inmates were discovered . Prosecuting, Ruby Selva said the letters contained 'sexual innuendos' and 'romantic overtures'. One letter written by Baker and dated June 1, 2012, had never been sent but showed she was 'receptive of his interest.' Ms Selva said: 'She writes as if they were friends. They have something special, that they can work through things, that she loves him.' Guildford Crown Court heard that Baker poured her heart out about problems she was having with her current boyfriend. The familiarity and detail in a letter dated June 16, 2012 showed that the pair 'must have spent considerable time together and got to know each other well,' added Ms Selva. 'It tells of the sex they will have and it tells of reciprocated love.' Baker got to know the prisoner when she worked at young offenders institution HMP Isis, in Greenwich, south-east London, between 2010 and 2012 . Baker had got to know the prisoner when she worked at young offenders institution HMP Isis, in Greenwich, south-east London, between 2010 and 2012, the court was told. After this time, she would go to Croydon, to meet the prisoner's brother to collect letters he had written to her and the brother's phone number was found in her phone under a pseudonym when her phone was searched by police. Ms Selva said that this in itself represented a further offence, as the brother had also served jail time and it was against the law for prison officers to be in contact with former prisoners. Citing the letters' content as damning proof of the inappropriate relationship between guard and prisoner, Ms Selva said: 'There are clear expressions of love and the future that they will have together.' However, Rachel Naylor, defending, said it was absurd to seriously consider a future with a man serving a life sentence. 'In my submission, they show the immaturity of Mrs Baker and are probably indicative of a fantasy,' she said. 'It is simply a false fantasy rather than a meaningful bond.' Ms Naylor continued: 'Mrs Baker accepts that she displayed extraordinary stupidity. She accepts she foolishly, wilfully, misconducted herself. She accepts that is inexcusable. 'She has maintained throughout there has been no physical contact.' Baker was also said to have had an inappropriate relationship with a prisoner serving a five year jail term for firearms offences. This prisoner had two periods of 'overlap' with Baker, serving time in HMP Isis from August 2011 and in HMP High Down from February 2012, when Baker was employed there. This prisoner had two periods of 'overlap' with Baker, serving time in HMP Isis, which is part of high-security prison Belmarsh, pictured, and in HMP High Down from February 2012 . A letter from this inmate to Baker was intercepted in the Category B men's prison in Banstead, Surrey in 2012, in which the prisoner referred to their relationship as 'our little thing,' and made clear his sexual intentions. A further letter was found from him in the stash of nine letters in Baker's bedroom, understood to have been taken out of prison by her. Prosecutors insisted Baker had been trained to report such matters to her superiors. Basic prison training included how to interact with prisoners, avoid cohesive behaviour from inmates, and how to report any conflicts of interest. The young guard had reported several such conflicts when she recognised an inmate from school and another through family links. 'From 2012 this defendant was fully aware of the rules and was capable of declaring conflicts of interest,' Ms Selva said. Disciplinary proceedings were started against Baker last year after allegations of improper conduct, including allegations she had smuggling phones and drugs into prison. Suspicions had been aroused after the inmate who wrote her letters at High Down was caught with mobile phones three times in six months. Rumours were even circulating in the prison that Baker was a prostitute after one inmate made allegations of a sexual nature against the young guard, the court heard, but she always denied these claims and none were proceeded with by the Crown Prosecution Service. Baker resigned from HMP High Down amid the scandal in August 2013, when her misconduct was discovered by detectives. Ms Naylor said the former guard from Crawley, West Sussex, had married her long-term love, who had stuck with her throughout and with whom she had a seven-month old baby. He had written a heartfelt letter to the judge in support of his wife although it was not read to the court. Baker was now pregnant with their second child, Ms Naylor added, and had the full support of her parents, who both had long careers as prison guards themselves. The devastated couple sat in the court's public gallery, wiping their eyes as they watched their daughter crying in the dock. Baker broke into hysterical sobs when Judge Christopher Critchlow told her he would be handing her a custodial sentence for her breach of a trusted position. Sentencing her to 12 months in prison, Judge Critchlow told Baker she would serve half that sentence, so would be out before she was due to give birth. 'I've been told that your parents are or were prison officers,' he said. 'It must be very sad for them to see you in your current position. 'So it's a case of you receiving letters from a prisoner at Isis, not reporting them. 'You met his brother. You shouldn't have done that and you should have reported it. 'These were the inappropriate relationships you had in your position.' Judge Critchlow continued: 'The integrity of each officer is of paramount importance. Something like this, of course, reflects on others with whom you work. 'There must be an immediate term of imprisonment. There must be an element of deterrent.' Sobbing hysterically as she was told to change roles from guard to prisoner and go down to the cells, Baker looked at her devastated parents in horror, crying out, 'I love you, I'm sorry.'","Syndi Baker forged close relationships with two male prisoners at work .

'This is our signature theme for our Christmas decorating,' reads a post on the store's Facebook. 'He is a worthless individual. He will be caught.' The annual window display honoring the holiday classic includes memorabilia from the 1983 film, including several versions of the now-iconic leg lamp, WIVB reports.

Walked right out of the store: 'This is our signature theme for our Christmas decorating,' reads a post on the store's Facebook. 'He is a worthless individual. He will be caught.' In the movie, main character Ralphie's father wins a prize that turns out to be a garish lamp in the shape of a woman's leg in a fishnet stocking. Ralphie's mother despises the novelty after seeing the way her husband covets it and pretends to 'accidentally' break it, leaving the Old Man heartbroken. In reality, the lamp has become the most memorable prop--along with its synonymous 'Fra-Gee-Lay' movie quote--from the holiday favorite film. A Christmas Story airs round-the-clock on several U.S. television stations each year.

Even after three decades, the triple-dog dare doesn't get old. The film A Christmas Story opened 31 years ago to mixed reviews but has shown its staying power as a holiday family favorite. Cleveland, where parts of the movie were filmed and hard-luck Ralphie dreamed big, is celebrating the anniversary with iconic leg lamps, holiday store windows like the ones that drew Ralphie's wide-eyed stares, and stage and musical versions of A Christmas Story. 'It becomes part of your fabric for your whole life,' said Kevin Moore, managing director of the Cleveland Play House, where the stage version of the story has become a holiday staple. An American family: Blue collar quirkiness and all-American family values make A Christmas Story a perennial favorite . In the film, starring Darren McGavin as the father, 9-year-old Ralphie was transfixed by the brightly decorated storefront windows. And he dreamed of getting an air rifle as a Christmas gift, despite warnings that he might shoot his eye out. The plot follows his determined gift-begging, his encounters with bullies and his family's daily hopes and dreams - including a lamp in the form of a shapely leg. The Cleveland house where Ralphie's film family lived will highlight the anniversary Friday and Saturday with appearances by original cast members and a BB gun range in the backyard. The movie wasn't widely acclaimed when it debuted, with favorable reviews barely outnumbering bad mentions like the one that grumped, 'Bah, humbug' in the headline. But its quirky humor and love-in-family message struck a chord with audiences. The appeal in Ralphie's blue-collar hometown is simple, Moore said. 'It's just a really quirky and yet incredibly sweet story and that resonates with Cleveland,' he said. The movie 'snow' was actually mostly firefighting foam, pressed into service amid a cold but rare snowless stretch during filming in winter-hardy Cleveland. Like many of the best holiday classics, the risky business turns cheerful at the end. Now families get together at holiday gatherings to watch the movie or crowd theater performances. 'It fills up the seats because it's a family experience,' Moore said. via AP .","A replica of the iconic 1983 film's most memorable prop walked right out of Yankee Spirits in North Tonawanda, New York on Thursday ."
"A vulnerable elderly man who died in the midst of a care home scandal cannot be named on the orders of public officials, the Daily Mail can reveal. The 85-year-old died less than 48 hours after being evacuated from a home that was suddenly closed after an inspection found filthy conditions, untrained staff and old people confined to a narrow area of the building. But his death and all details about it have been kept secret by the NHS, the local council, the register office which keeps death records, and the coroner who is supposed to investigate questionable deaths. Evacuation: The man who died, whose details are being kept secret, was among those removed from Merok Park in Banstead, Surrey, during the night . Critics have questioned how it is possible for an individual supposedly under the care of the state to die in secret with the public prevented from knowing his name, let alone the circumstances in which he died. The incident has provoked anger among MPs, watchdogs for the elderly, and civil liberties groups. One MP said: ‘If he was killed by the state you would expect the people involved to try to cover it up.’ The concern over the death of the 85-year-old, comes at a time of deepening alarm over the use of secrecy in the court system, and the spread of secrecy over deaths in particular. In the Surrey care home incident, both the coroner’s office – which said there was nothing suspicious about the death – and the register office responsible for recording it cited the Data Protection Act as a reason they could not identify the dead man. The Act does not extend to cover information about the deceased. The home was shut following an inspection by the Care Quality Commission; it ordered it be immediately closed after discovering an ‘overpowering’ smell of urine and that staff had not undergone safety checks, and because of a broken lift, some of the 25 residents were confined to the top floor of the building . The incident came after the sudden closure of the Merok Park nursing home in Banstead, Surrey, following an inspection by the Care Quality Commission. The regulator gave the home, which was run by Soondressen Cooppen and his wife Maleenee, a clean bill of health in January. However, earlier this month it ordered immediate closure of the home after discovering an ‘overpowering’ smell of urine and that staff had not undergone safety checks. Because of a broken lift, some of the 25 residents were confined to the top floor of the building. The residents were moved out of the home after dark, with the assistance of social workers, in a chaotic operation in which some were left in their pyjamas on one of the coldest nights of the year. Families were notified only hours before. The 85-year-old was moved to Warrengate nursing home nearby. The only public record of what happened to him next has been released by South East Coast Ambulance Service, which said an ambulance and a response car were sent to the Warrengate home just after 5.30am on December 11. This was less than two days after the evacuation of Merok Park. Warrengate director Zeenat Mehboob Rajan spoke briefly to say that a man moved from Merok Park had died. Scandal: The home was run by Soondressen Cooppen and his wife Maleenee, pictured above . All other aspects of the death remain secret and none of the authorities involved have been willing even to identify the individual. The Epsom and St Helier Universities NHS Trust, one of whose hospitals accepted the 85-year-old, said they would not name him. Surrey county council, whose social workers supervised the Merok Park evacuation, and which funds the coroners’ office and supervises the register office, declined to identify the man who died while in its care. Guildford register office, responsible for recording the death, also declined to identify him. An official said: ‘Due to data protection we need to fulfil certain criteria in order to locate your record. The criteria would be a date of death, a name and a place of death.’ The Home Office, which is in charge of registration procedures, backed up the refusal to identify him. Chief responsibility for establishing that there are no suspicious circumstances to the death lies with Surrey coroner Richard Travers. Mr Travers has decided no inquest into the death is required and that the public do not have a right to know the name of the man who died. An official said during inquiries by the Daily Mail that the Data Protection Act was ‘part’ of the reason. Mr Travers’ office said yesterday: ‘We wouldn’t give you the name. If an inquest has happened we would, but as it’s not an inquest we won’t. It’s for the family’s privacy. We don’t give out names. It’s as simple as that.’ The secret death of a vulnerable elderly man following severe state intrusion into his life provoked widespread concern. The residents were moved out of the home after dark, with the assistance of social workers, in a chaotic operation in which some were left in their pyjamas on one of the coldest nights of the year . Lib Dem MP John Hemming said: ‘If you do not release the name of the individual nobody can know if it was a natural death or not. If he was killed by the state you would expect the people involved to try to cover it up.’ Dr Ros Altmann, the Government’s older workers’ champion, said: ‘We must not keep sweeping these things under the carpet.’ She called for an investigation into the death by the Care Quality Commission. The civil liberties campaign group Liberty said: ‘When a vulnerable person dies in care, there is a legitimate public interest in knowing what happened. In whose interest is it to keep such things a secret?’ The Surrey case comes against a background of concern over the suspicious death of 13-month-old Poppi Worthington in Cumbria two years ago. Despite a long-running police investigation, an inquest in October revealed no more than the girl’s name, and a High Court judge has ruled that details of her death must continue to be kept secret after a request from social workers. The Department of Health said yesterday that it was up to local NHS agencies to choose whether they wanted to name patients. The Ministry of Justice and Department for Communities and Local Government declined to comment. Under attack, a right to know enshrined for 800 years . The public interest in proper investigation of deaths has been established for more than eight centuries. Under this principle, no deaths can be recorded without the public knowing how they happened and being reassured that there was no criminal activity or neglect. But our right to this information seems to be under attack. In recent years, even the names of people who have been the subject of supposedly open inquests have been kept secret. A death is reported to the coroner when a doctor suspects it may have occurred in suspicious circumstances, was sudden or unexplained, or was due to neglect. Other reasons include an accident or a suicide. Rule 11 of the Coroners (Inquest) Rules 2013 states that inquests must be held in public unless there are national security concerns – a category that Coalition ministers had wanted to widen. In 2012, the Government drew back from plans to allow more inquests to be held in secret because of Liberal Democrat opposition. Coroners are supposed to abide by the principle of open justice, which means they should make public the steps they have taken to assess a particular case. But earlier this year, Oxford coroner Darren Salter refused to reveal the name of a man into whose death he conducted an inquest. The man, whose death was found to be related to drink and drugs, was identified only as Christopher H. Mr Salter said: ‘He has a highly unusual surname and it is my decision not to make public the surname of the individual.’ He added that he did not want any children to be put at risk. Another death that has remained shrouded in secrecy is that of a 13-month-old girl, Poppi Worthington, in Cumbria in December 2012. Her inquest – which was meant to examine the circumstances of her death – revealed nothing to the public about what happened. A police inquiry is continuing. If a coroner closes a case after deciding an inquest is not needed, the law is less clear on whether the details should be public – but in theory the open justice principle still stands.","The 85-year-old died less than 48 after after leaving the Surrey care home .

"Controversy over police use of Tasers erupted again last night after the death of a man shot during an alleged burglary. The raid suspect is the second person in two months to die after being Tasered by police officers. He was shot with a 50,000-volt stun gun in the early hours of yesterday after reports of a break-in at flats in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire. Scroll down for video . Death: A man has died after being shot with a Taser stun gun by police at a home in Newcastle-under-Lyme . Investigation: The incident came after the man apparently tried to burgle a house early this morning . He was bundled into a police car, but soon became ‘unresponsive’ and died hours later in custody following emergency treatment. Last month Matthew Williams, 34, died after being shot with a stun gun following a horrific attack on Cerys Yemm at a hostel for the homeless. Miss Yemm was allegedly murdered by Williams who ‘ate her face while high on cocaine’ in Caerphilly, South Wales. Police discharged the Taser after finding the 22-year-old unconscious with severe facial injuries. Solicitor Sophie Khan, from the Police Action Centre, has now called on Theresa May to consider a temporary ban on Tasers. She said stun guns are a ‘real threat to life and their use must now be curbed’. Yesterday officers remained on guard outside the flat, which neighbours say is occupied by a ‘hard-working’ couple in their twenties and their baby boy. Police: Officers at the scene in the aftermath of the fatal Taser shooting in the early hours of the morning . Block: The attempted burglary and subsequent death happened at these flats in Newcastle-under-Lyme . On guard: A police officer at the scene with a Taser holstered on his jacket . Neighbour Mark Finney, 50, said: ‘I was asleep and at around 1.30am, I woke up and heard shouting and tremendous banging. It sounded like someone was in distress.’ A 22-year-old local resident, who did not want to be named, said he heard the Taser victim shout ‘help me’ after the stun gun was fired at around 1.45am. He added: ‘There were seven or eight police and I saw them dragging this bloke out. ‘He was still alive then but he looked like he was drunk or something. They were carrying him with their arms under his shoulders. They bunged him in the back of the van.’ Staffordshire Police, which deploys Tasers more than any other force in the country, has now been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which will investigate the death. Probe: The Independent Police Complaints Commission will be investigating the man's death . Quiet: The incident took place in the suburb of Chesterton just outside Newcastle-under-Lyme . An IPCC report revealed in July that Staffordshire officers had used Tasers as ‘a deterrent’ 619 times in the past nine years. Between 2012 and 2013, the force fired stun guns a total of 71 times – more than three times more than similar-sized forces such as Leicestershire and West Mercia Police. The weapons have been linked to at least ten deaths in England and Wales over the past decade. Staffordshire’s police and crime commissioner Matthew Ellis said it was ‘immensely sad’ that a man had lost his life, but added that it would be inappropriate to comment further during an ongoing IPCC investigation. Witness: Mark Finney said he heard screams but could not tell what was going on in the flat .

"Their original owners are long since dead but amazingly these genuine 19th century tattoos are still pulling in a few admiring glances. They form part of a weird and wonderful collection of  tattooed human skin which has just been put on display in Bucharest, Romania. The collection once belonged to the late Dr Nicolae Minovici, a famous Romanian forensic scientist, who grafted them  from  bodies held at the Institute of Forensic Medicine where he was the manager.

Among the most fascinating tattoos on display are those which once belonged to Alexandru Popescu, a tailor born in Bucharest in 1900, who has a special corner in the exhibition. At the age of 27, Popescu enlisted in the French Foreign Legion and was sent to Morocco to fight the rebellious tribes.

"A grieving mother has been left furious after the council she works for sent her a £700 bill for a bench in memory of her three-year-old daughter. The bench was put up in Keighley Town Hall Square, West Yorkshire, last year in memory of councillor Andrea Walker's daughter, Ellie, who tragically died in January 2013 from blood poisoning. But a few weeks ago cllr Walker received a letter from Graham Mitchell, the council's chairman, asking her about repayments. Councillor Andrea Walker on the bench in memory of her daughter in Town Hall Square, Keighley. She was told funds would be raised to pay for it, but Keighley Town Council have now said she must pay the £700 bill . Cllr Walker, who has been with the Keighley Town Council for 11 years, said the letter was an insult to her dead daughter. This incident is the latest embarrassment for the beleaguered town council, after a report last month into its workings identified a catalogue of weaknesses and potentially unlawful practices. A report  by the Audit Commission, uncovered 'a number of significant weaknesses in the Council's governance.' The report said: 'In particular we have identified evidence that poor governance has led to the Council to make decisions due consideration of its legal powers and, as a consequence, to take actions that may be unlawful.' The report concluded that the council has failed to properly safeguard public money because of a lack of internal controls. MS Walker claims the council has previously paid for benches in memory of councillors and she believed a 'verbal agreement' had been made that her bench would be sponsored or paid for out of council funds. The memorial bench is for Ellie (pictured) who tragically died in January 2013 from blood poisoning . She also said she was led to believe she would not have to pay for the bench and is upset at now being told to pay up. Cllr Walker has admitted she cannot remember exactly what was said at the time because she was taking anti-depressant drugs. She also said she has not received any paperwork other than the letter and a 'Sales Statement,' received last week, which said 'Please return remittance slip. Total due £703.' Cllr Mitchell suggested in his letter that until the matter is resolved, it might be better for cllr Walker not to attend finance and audit committee meetings 'or at least any portion of a meeting which might have to discuss this matter.' He added: 'Please understand that this is not an instruction from me. 'This is only a suggestion from me as Chair of the Council and the decision as to whether you attend or not must be entirely yours.' Cllr Mitchell told cllr Walker that 'our many critics, especially those on Facebook, could cause you considerable embarrassment if they felt you were participating in discussions in the Finance and Audit Committee, about your personal financial circumstances. 'I am sure that you understand that we all have to take extra care regarding our interests at this difficult time.' Senior councillors have said the situation with the bench is 'puzzling' and 'bizarre'. One councillor said he believed there had been a 'verbal agreement' to provide a 'loan' which would be repaid. He claimed cllr Walker had already repaid some of the money, but she denies paying anything. The senior councillor, who asked not to be named, said he had opposed providing a bench free of charge because 'it would set a precedent - if we put a bench for one, we would have to do it for everybody.' He said moves were being made by colleagues to have the debt 'written off'  - but that he would be opposing this. 'I think that she should pay it back. I will be voting against writing the debt off. It's a bizarre story, I find it puzzling.' A council meeting on Thursday saw a decision to write off the £703 debt deferred. A finance committee has already voted that it should not be pursued. MailOnline has contacted Keighley Town Council for a statement.","Keighley Town Council paid £700 for bench in memory of councillor's child .

Marnie, shot to fame this year after being pictured with her celebrity fans including Miley Cyrus, James Franco and Demi Lovato. The heartwarming story of her rescue captured the hearts of thousands and today she boasts more than 780,000 followers on Instagram. Marnie the dog was once known as 'Stinky,' and lived a harsh life on the streets of Connecticut. But her life changed dramatically for the better when the lovable dog was adopted. Caught on camera: Marnie, shot to fame this year after being pictured with her celebrity fans including Miley Cyrus James Franco and Demi Lovato . Living the high life: The heartwarming story of her rescue captured the hearts of thousands and today she boasts more than 780,000 followers on Instagram . Owner Shirley Braha has wrote a biography of Marnie's life on social networking website Tumblr and it makes for an interesting read. Marnie was found by Animal Control in August 2012 on the streets of Connecticut with matted and smelly fur. The scruffy looking Shih Tzu was moved to a shelter and named Stinky, before being adopted as a result of a petfinder.com post. Stinky took a train with her new adopted owner Ms Braha down to her new home in New York City and she stunk out the entire train. She was later renamed as Marnie after musician Marnie Stern and shortly afterwards she had 14 decaying teeth removed and started smelling much nicer. Dressed to impress: Marnie appeared to enjoy her recent outing . Born performer: Her novel Christmas outfit was topped with a fur-trimmed hat and gold-buckled waist belt . Marnie's left eye was so gray and cloudy that her new owner was told she would never see again from that eye. On her Tumblr page about Marnie's owner Ms Braha, an MTV producer and director, says the dog's long tongue is often a source of bemusement and intrigue. She writes: 'The reality is Marnie just has a long tongue, and has always had a long tongue, and its awesome, and she licks it every few minutes to keep it from getting too dry, and when it's snowing she puts her tongue back in.' Another unique physical feature Marnie has is a head tilt which a senior veterinarian said was not a major concern and may have occurred as a result of a previous brief illness called Vestibular Syndrome. Urban explorer: The 12-year-old dog's favorite things are long walks, exploring, sleeping, chicken, broccoli, Greek yogurt, watermelon eggs and parties . Ms Braha says despite her difficult start in life once Marnie became more comfortable in her new home and gained confidence, her personality began to shine through. Thankfully soon after she was adopted Marnie's left eye began to improve and she is now able to see again. The 12-year-old dog's favorite things are long walks, exploring, sleeping, chicken, broccoli, Greek yogurt, watermelon eggs and parties.

"The woman charged with the murders of seven of her children and one young niece in her Cairns home 'knows what has happened' but it 'hasn't sunk in yet,' her lawyer said today. Raina Thaiday, 37, who is also known as Mersane Warria, is being held in Cairns Base Hospital on under police guard, and did not appear in court when the charged against her were mentioned today. 'She's presently on an involuntary treatment order, which means she will be assessed so once she has been assessed then it may go to the mental health court at that stage,' her lawyer, Steve Macfarlane, said outside Cairns courthouse. Scroll down for video . New details have been revealed about mother-of-nine Raina Mersane Ina Thaiday, who was formally charged with the stabbing deaths of eight children in her Cairns home on Friday morning . Malili (standing left) and Daniel (standing right), along with (sitting, from left) Rayden, Petronella, Rodney and (far right) Azariah were allegedly killed by their mother. A cousin (second from right) is not a victim . 'She's coping as best as she can in Cairns Base Hospital where she will be for a while.' Asked by journalists about her state, Mr Macfarlane said: 'I'm not a doctor, but I think she probably knows what happened but doesn't realise it, it hasn't sunk in.' Magistrate Alan Comans adjourned the case until January 30. 'Until she's finished her treatment and police have finished their investigation there's not a lot that can be done,' Mr Macfarlane said. Thaiday's lawyer also confirmed the alleged murderer has had visitors to her bedside. 'I'm aware that she has been visited by some people but how close a family member they are and how many people I am not aware of,' Mr Macfarlane said. Inside court, no family attended the hearing as Mr Macfarlane requested the trial be heard in a mental health court. Mr Comans rejected the request, saying: 'No, there is no need.' Local member of parliament Gavin King said the house where the children's bodies were found would likely be demolished and a permanent memorial erected, as it was what the community wanted. 'It is the right thing to do to help with the healing process,' Mr King told reporters near the property. As police try and determine what could have driven Thaiday to allegedly murder seven of her nine children, along with a niece, at a home in Manoora, a suburb of Cairns, north Queensland, new details have emerged regarding her troubled past and recent erratic behaviour. Neighbours have told how she reportedly ran through the streets on Thursday night screaming ‘Don’t let them take them away from us. God bless us. Forgive me for what I’ll do’. A local told The Courier Mail that after recently finding God, Thaiday believed mobile phones were 'the work of the devil'. Thaiday's lawyer Steve Macfarlane says she is still in Cairns Base Hospital under police guard . Mersane Warria is pictured being taken away by paramedics from a Cairns home on Friday . Police remain at the scene on Saturday, guarding the house where eight children were stabbed to death . The Australian reported Thaiday's, whose nine children had five different fathers, struggled to find a stable home after falling pregnant at 14 and was allegedly attacked with a hammer a decade ago. While she is refusing to speak to police in any detail about the horrific stabbings she has been calling the tragic deaths ‘the incident’, The Australian says. Thaiday, 37, has been formally charged with the deaths of four girls, aged 14, 12, 11, and two, and four boys, aged 9, 8, 6, and five, who were found in their Murray Street home by their 20-year-old brother on Friday morning. An uncle of the eight children said Thaiday had begun expressing increased religious devotion, attending St Margaret’s Anglican Church in Westcourt every Sunday for the month leading up to the alleged mass murder. 'She had this church DVD she was always watching. She'd started preaching to me in the last week or so. Always talking about God,’ he said. More neighbours revealed Thaiday was seen by neighbours running through the street screaming at 3am on the morning the bodies were found. Senior investigators refused to rule out the possibility that drugs were a factor in Thaiday’s behaviour. The father of the youngest four children was carried to add flowers to the tribute, collapsing on the floor and beating the ground at the foot of the willow tree . The grandmother of seven of the children who were killed wailed: 'No! No! My babies, my babies!' Shortly after she gave birth to her first child she moved into cramped public housing in Manoora and was shunted between houses as her family grew, The Australian reported. Anna Jackson, who has known Thaiday for more than 20 years, said she had been abused by a former partner, who allegedly bashed her on the head with a hammer. Less than a week ago, one of the children's fathers moved out of the home  they shared after the children’s uncle reported hearing fighting. 'He's been heard shouting at her that if she didn't stop, he was leaving. And then he did, moving into a house with other relatives,' he said. 'The dad wanted to take the kids up to Bamaga. That's what he told me he was doing, he'd been talking about it for six weeks.’ Thaiday appeared before a magistrate in a bedside hearing at the Cairns hospital, where she is being treated for stab wounds to the chest, which were possibly self-inflicted. At the house were heartbreaking scenes as family members made their way up to a willow tree where tributes have been left for the young alleged victims. The maternal grandmother of seven of the children who were killed wailed: 'No! No! My babies, my babies!' Police continue to collect evidence at the Murray Street home in Manoora - 4km away from Cairns . A view of the backyard of a house in which eight children were stabbed to death in the Cairns . She was supported by other family members as she wailed, her eyes closed in raw grief as she clutched a small white towel to her face to wipe away her tears. Several men carried one of the fathers to the scene where he sat on a seat - weak and inconsolable. He was frail and unable to hold his own body up as he screamed his children's names into the sky in a hoarse voice. The father of the youngest four children was carried to add flowers to the tribute, collapsing on the floor and beating the ground at the foot of the tree. ‘Raiden’, ‘Rodney’, ‘Azza’ and ‘baby girl’, the father screamed over and over again in a rasping voice, while sobbing uncontrollably. Detective Inspector Bruno Ansicar told reporters on Sunday the horrific scene was taking its toll on police. 'It's clearly the most tragic event we've had to deal with (in Cairns),' Insp Ansicar told reporters. Vigils and memorials for the slain children, who ranged in age from two to 14, were held throughout Queensland on Sunday. Townsville and the Brisbane suburb of Inala also hosted memorials.

"The northern New Jersey go-go bar that served as the backdrop for strip club scenes in The Sopranos was robbed of $30,000 on Sunday, police said. Two men with shotguns entered Satin Dolls, a nightclub located along New Jersey Route 17 in Lodi, taking $30,000 early Sunday morning. Lodi police said in a notice posted to Facebook that the gunmen fled the scene. Stripped: The northern New Jersey go-go bar that served as the backdrop for strip club scenes in The Sopranos was robbed of $30,000 on Sunday, police said . The club earned notoriety for being used as the Bada Bing - or sometimes simply The Bing - on the HBO series, with some of its dancers even playing the part of strippers in the show. Mob boss Tony Soprano, played by the late James Gandolfini, owned the strip club and conducted business from the side of the stage or in the back office. When Gandolfini died in 2013, CBS reported that the phones at Satin Dolls were ringing constantly with calls. 'He actually made this bar, you know, people know it by ""The Bada Bing,""' said Satin Dolls manager Lance Lyons of Gandolfini. The mob ties at Satin Girls run deeper than The Sopranos. Anthony Cardinalle, 62, whose family owns the  property for Satin Dolls, was alleged to be an associate of the Genovese crime family during a federal mob crackdown. Memories: When Gandolfini died in 2013, the phones at Satin Dolls were ringing constantly with calls, according to a manager there . Inspiration: Mob ties at Satin Dolls ran deeper than the HBO series, as an owner of the real estate for the club was swept up in a criminal investigation of mob involvement in waste hauling . The New York Daily News reports that Cardinalle took a plea deal last December and agreed to cooperate with the feds in a criminal case against organized crime involvement in waste hauling. Another defendant in the case, Howard Ross, was described by William Pepe of Satin Dolls in a document filed in court as 'holding court at the bar' of the club playing up mob ties. 'Ross was always bragging about his mafia connections and how he knew everybody in the five families,' he stated in court filings. Pepe made those statements at a time when Cardinalle was asking for a psychiatric evaluation to be performed on Ross, who had dished to an agent posing as a waste hauling company owner.","Satin Dolls in Lodi was robbed by two gunmen early Sunday morning .

Four men and one woman were arrested at the school in April after a six-year-old boy claimed to have been sexually assaulted . The four male defendants were sentenced to eight years, while the only woman in the case received seven years as an accomplice. All the defendants were also fined to pay $8,000 respectively or serve three more months in jail. Their lawyers contended that the evidence was weak since medical reports found the boy had no major injuries or abnormalities. Prosecutors said the boy had been sodomized up to 13 times. 'The verdicts were unfair,' said Patra M. Zein, one of the lawyers. 'We will appeal, and hopefully we will get justice from the higher courts.' Upset: Afrischa Setyani was the only woman convicted and was given seven years in prison as an accomplice. The four male defendants were sentenced to eight years . Behind bars: Afrischa Setyani weeps after being found guilty of helping the four men rape the child . A Canadian teacher, Neil Bantleman, and an Indonesian teaching assistant, Ferdinant Tjiong, also went on trial earlier this month over the case. They are accused of sexually abusing the boy and two other students. Both maintained their innocence. The school's principal and a number of fellow teachers also say the two are innocent. The school is attended by children of foreign diplomats, ex-patriots and Indonesia's elite. It has 2,400 students aged 3 to 18 from about 60 countries.","Four male cleaners jailed for eight years for raping six-year-old schoolboy .

'Instagram has a strong LEGO community, but there was nothing on the topic of famers,' Ms Snowden said. 'I've grown up on a farm and always had an interest in Australian agriculture, so when I saw The LEGO Travellers I saw a different way to connect with people who are not familiar with what goes on in a farm. 'LEGO is also a great toy that transcends generations and allows you to be creative.'

"A New York Yankees charity will pay for the education of the sons of murdered NYPD cop Rafael Ramos, after their father was gunned down in his patrol car in Brooklyn on Saturday. The Yankee Silver Shield Foundation, which provides  for the children of officers who died in the line of duty, will take on any education expenses for 13-year-old Jaden and Ramos' other son who is in college. Rafael Ramos, 40, was murdered in the targeted attack alongside his  partner Wenjian Liu when 28-year-old Ismaaiyl Abdullah Brinsley crept up behind their patrol car and shot them both in the head - before turning the gun on himself. The Yankee Silver Shield Foundation will take on any education expenses for 13-year-old Jaden (left) and Ramos' other son who is in college. Right: Jaden in his younger years with his father Rafael Ramos . Liu, 32, was recently married but did not have any children. Former Yankees owner George Steinbrenner set up the Silver Shield Foundation in 1982 and since then it has paid for the education of thousands of children of fallen NYPD, FDNY, state police and Port Authority workers in the tri-state area. It has also taken on the costs for the education of some 700 children who lost a parent in the terrorists attacks on September 11, 2001. The Silver Shield Foundation was started by James Fuchs and George Steinbrenner in 1982 to pay for the education expenses of all children and spouses of New York law enforcement and other authorities killed in the line of duty.

The Silver Shield Foundation was started by James Fuchs and George Steinbrenner in 1982 to pay for the education expenses of all children and spouses of New York law enforcement and other authorities killed in the line of duty . In a phone interview with ABC News, the group's chairman William Walters said the foundation has already reached out to the police department, but it has not been in contact with Ramos' family. 'We just want to do good for these people that take care of us,' he added. After hearing the news of his father's death, Jaden Ramos took to social media to publicly celebrate his adoring father and condemn his cold-blooded killer. Rafael Ramos (left) was murdered in the targeted attack alongside his partner Wenjian Liu (right) Jaden posted this picture online several days ago as a birthday present to his father Rafael Ramos . 'Today I had to say bye to my father. He was their for me everyday of my life, he was the best father I could ask for. It's horrible that someone gets shot dead just for being a police officer,' he posted. 'Everyone says they hate cops but they are the people that they call for help. I will always love you and I will never forget you. RIP Dad.' Jaden's  tribute came Sunday as a heartbroken community in Brooklyn started a makeshift memorial of flowers and candles at the site of the slayings in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood. Ramos' cousin, Ronnie Gonzalez, insisted that the family's focus is on remembering the father, rather than directing anger at gunman Ismaaiyl Brinsley. Ismaaiyl Abdullah Brinsley, 28, murdered the two officers in cold blood, before turning the gun on himself . '[Brinsley] in the hands of God now,' Gonzalez told Pix11. 'We don't believe in vengeance, we just forgive.' He added that Ramos was due to graduate as a chaplain this weekend. 'My cousin had a couple of priorities in his life,' Ronnie Gonzalez told the Wall Street Journal from outside the Brooklyn home where Officer Ramos grew up.

The flowers will be composted and used as fertiliser at a future site in tribute to mother-of-three Ms Dawson and  Mr Johnson. The weather forecast for Sydney on Tuesday is a high chance of showers with chances of thunderstorms in the afternoon and early evening. NSW Premier Mike Baird said that the Australian government had been in contact with London and Boston, cities which have both housed large-scale floral memorial sites, for advice on how to transport and reconstitute the flowers. The removal of parts of the memorial has been designed to preserve the messages and not to discourage people from paying their respects at Martin Place, a spokeswoman for the NSW premier said.

The Premier confirmed that the government had been in contact with London to find out how authorities in the city composted the ten of thousands of flowers left at memorial sites after the death of Princess Diana in 1997, reported The Daily Telegraph. The tens of thousands of flowers placed at the Martin Place memorials sites expanded quickly after the first bouquet was left on Tuesday morning, and in light of the continual flow of tributes, the Premier confirmed that the flowers would be preserved and 'clean composted' for a future site to preserve the memory of public compassion and support. 'The NSW Government is in contact with authorities in London and Boston regarding flowers, tributes notes and condolence books to ensure we are operating on prior international best practice.' A single bunch of white roses left resting on a pole when the siege ended at 2.15am on Tuesday has sparked the beginning of a makeshift shrine that has now grown to take over a large portion of Martin Place.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott, NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione, Premier Mike Baird and Australia's Governor General Sir Peter Cosgrove travelled to the site to pay their respects to those who had lost their lives and the 15 other hostages who were terrorised by Man Haron Monis. The death of Princess Diana touched the UK public in a manner which authorities had not anticipated, with images of the floral tributes left to honour her memory circulating the globe. On the eve of her funeral, the number of flower bouquet's reached one million, and her family requested that flowers stop being laid outside her family home as they had become a 'threat to public safety'. A single bunch of white roses left resting on a pole when the siege ended sparked the  makeshift shrine . It quickly grew to thousands of bunches of flowers which overtook the area near the Lindt cafe . After the Boston bombings, bouquets left on Bolyson Street where the tragic attack happened formed a makeshift memorials which spread rapidly. Mourners left thousands of floral bouquets and notes, and well as running shoes, T-shirts, flags, hats, near the finish line of the marathon where the two bombs went off. Friends and family members of the victims, as well as members of the Australian public and government have laid not only flowers, but notes, sentimental items, and drawings in honour of the victims. NSW Premier Mike Baird says a permanent memorial will be erected in Martin Place when the time is right. 'This is something that will be with us forever. We need to recognise that and pay tribute to the inspiring Australians that we have lost, and what they have given us,' he told Macquarie Radio. 'They've given us something so special which is this unprecedented bond of togetherness and strength in the face of adversity.' The NSW Premier confirmed that the flowers would be preserved and 'clean composted' for a future site to preserve the memory of public compassion and support . Tens of thousands of Sydneysiders have paid tribute in condolence books to the two victims of the siege . Standing in front of the sea of flowers, Mr Baird said the city and state was coming together like never before. 'My heart is beating louder and prouder because of what we are seeing,' he told Sky News. Mr Baird says the outpouring of emotion is remarkable. 'I've seen a four-year-old through to a 75-year-old, people from different faiths and backgrounds ... putting flowers down, all united. It's an outpouring of grief, but at the same time it's almost this unprecedented unity,' he told the Seven Network. 'It is a healing process, but it shows this city is back.'\ .

"Two convicted Islamic extremists who were deported from Britain in 2012 have emerged as jihadis fighting for ISIS in Iraq - one as a senior commander, and the other as a suicide bomber. Christian Emde, 30, and Robert Baum, 25, were convicted of entering the UK in possession of computers filled with radical material, including a chilling document explaining how to make bombs. The German nationals, who are both Muslim converts from the city of Solingen, were remanded at Belmarsh high security prison awaiting trial and, upon being convicted, the Home Office was able to send them back to Germany to serve their respective 16 and 12 month jail sentences. It has now emerged, however, that both men subsequently made their way to join the Islamic State  in Iraq - with Emde a senior commander based in the terror group's stronghold Mosul, and Baum a suicide bomber who ISIS claimed had blown himself up in a sickening recent propaganda video. Terror: Calling himself Abu Malik al-Almani Christian Emde speaks withauthority on behalf of the terror group's leadership, and details ISIS' future strategies and chilling plans to expand into Europe . Jihadi: German national Robert Baum reportedly appeared in a sickening suicide bomb attack that ISIS filmed and released online in a five-minute long propaganda video titled 'Our State is Victorious' Convicts: Christian Emde, 30, (left) and Robert Baum, 25, (right) were convicted of entering the UK in possession of computers filled with radical material, including a document explaining how to make bomb . Details of Emde's rise within ISIS emerged when maverick German journalist Juergen Todenhoefer recently spent 10 days with ISIS in Mosul - the oil rich city in north west Iraq which was captured and occupied by the terrorists in June of this year. Remarkable footage taken within the city shows how everyday life is continuing within the city, despite the militants enforcing a brutal interpretation of Sharia law, deliberately destroying ancient buildings and monuments and forcing Christians to either convert, pay a tax, or face execution. Although hundreds of thousands of persecuted locals have fled the area over the past few months, Todenhoefer has spent that time in deep online conversation with representatives of terror leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and was eventually granted permission to travel to Mosul. The journalist was provided with written assurances that he would come to no harm during his visit and fighters gave him a guided tour around the city - including visiting the Mosul mosque where al-Baghdadi famously gave a public sermon upon his self-declaration as a new caliph. While many of the jihadis tell of their experiences fighting for the Islamic State, one calling himself Abu Malik al-Almani speaks with greater authority on behalf of the terror group's leadership, and details ISIS' future strategies and chilling plans to expand into Europe. This man is Emde, the former radical convicted of bringing computers laden with terror material into Britian - including a copy of the official Al Qaeda magazine Inspire which featured an eight-page article titled 'How to make a bomb in the kitchen of your mom'. Militant: Wearing a bobble hat and spectacles, clean-shaven Robert Baum could easily be mistaken for any bookish young Westerner. That is until he points at a detonator on his vest and utters the chilling phrase: 'With a press of the button, everything blows up'. Later in the ISIS video he carries out a suicide attack . Blast: A recent ISIS propaganda video shows German national Robert Baum - who called himself by the nom de guerres Abu Uthman or Abu Sara al-Almani - blowing himself up in a suicide bomb attack . Past: The Erasmus Institit, which monitors German jihadis, claims Christian Emde changed his name to Abu Maik al-Almani while held at Belmarsh prison awaiting trial . Speaking to Todenhoefer in a video report published by CNN, Emde vowed that ISIS would soon bring their campaign of brutality and persecution to Europe. 'We will conquer Europe one day. It is not a question of if we will conquer Europe, just a matter of when that will happen. But it is certain,' he said. 'And the Europeans need to know that when we come, it will not be in a nice way. It will be with our weapons. And those who do not convert to Islam or pay the Islamic tax will be killed,' he added. 'Our expansion will be perpetual... For us, there is no such thing as borders. There are only front lines,' Emde went on to say. When asked about ISIS' treatment of those practicing other religions, the militant said the terror group will 'kill them all', adding: '150 million, 200 million or 500 million, it does not matter to us'. His shocking views on ISIS' barbaric practice of taking female sex slaves was equally barbaric. 'I would say that slavery is a great help to us and we will continue to have slavery and beheadings, it is part of our religion ... many slaves have converted to Islam and have then been freed.' On the subject of ISIS' filming their savage beheading of Western journalists and aid workers, Emde said: 'People should really think about the case of James Foley...He did not get killed because we started the battle. He got killed because of the ignorance of his government that did not give him any help.' Tour: The journalist was provided with written assurances that he would come to no harm during his visit and fighters gave him a guided tour around the city - including visiting the Mosul mosque where terror leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured) famously gave a public sermon upon his self-declaration as a new caliph . Stronghold: Although American airstrikes continue to bombard ISIS targets, Todenhoefer thinks the militants are unlikely to be defeated in Mosul (pictured) anytime soon . Emde's shocking comments came just weeks after his partner in crime Robert Baum reportedly appeared in a sickening suicide bomb attack that ISIS filmed and released online in a five-minute long propaganda video titled 'Our State is Victorious'. Wearing a knitted bobble hat and spectacles, clean-shaven Baum could easily be mistaken for any bookish young Westerner until he points at a detonator on his suicide vest and utters the chilling phrase: 'With a press of the button, everything blows up.' The video then cuts to a scene showing an explosion and the vehicle in which Baum - who called himself by the noms de guerre Abu Uthman or Abu Sara al-Almani - had been travelling is seen as a fireball. The sickening attack came just two years after Baum converted to Islam in the same German city, Solinger, as his friend Emde. The pair quickly became embroiled in the more radical side of the religion and, after leaving prison following his British conviction, lived a radical mosque in the city. When the group was banned later in 2012, many of its members reportedly went to Egypt to support the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood. At some point over the next two years, both Emde and Baum instead travelled to Syria where they waged jihad on behalf of the Islamic State. Caliphate: A map purportedly showing the areas ISIS plans to have under its control within five years has been widely shared online. As well as the Middle East, North Africa and large areas of Asia, it also reveals ISIS' ambition to extend into Europe. Spain, which was Muslim-ruled until the late 15th Century, would form part of the caliphate, as would the Balkan states and eastern Europe, up to and including Austria . The oil rich city of Mosul was captured and occupied by Islamic State terrorists in June of this year . Todenhoefer's incredible journey to visit the ISIS-held city of Mosul was the result of months of negotiations via Skype with the terror group's senior leadership. Having previously written articles critical of ISIS, Todenhoefer demanded written assurances that he would not come to harm and, astonishingly, the terror group kept their word. Upon return the journalist told how ISIS is a larger and more united force than is widely believed in the West, and said he was concerned America and Britain had underestimated the jihadis. Todenhoefer said that he stayed in a recruitment house where 50 new foreign fighters arrived every single day, and was introduced to militants who claimed their success is driven by their not fearing death, while their enemies - including the Iraqi army - do not have the stomach for the battle. In one heartbreaking encounter a young boy clad in ISIS' black uniform identifies himself as being just 13-years-old. Although his smiling face is one of innocence, the assault rifle in his hands points to a dramatically different future for this young jihadi-in-training. Although American airstrikes continue to bombard ISIS targets ahead on an expected Iraqi army spring offensive to force the terrorists out of their strongholds, Todenhoefer thinks the militants are unlikely to be defeated anytime soon. 'I think the Islamic State is a lot more dangerous than Western leaders realize... They believe in what they are fighting for and are preparing the largest religious cleansing campaign the world has ever seen,' he said.","Christian Emde and Robert Baum entered UK with radical material in 2011 .

"Facebook is at the centre of a free speech storm after apparently blocking a page which supported one of Vladimir Putin's sternest critics. Some 13,000 people joined an event page calling for a rally in central Moscow, where opposition leader Alexei Navalny faces up to ten years' jail over fraud charges he has branded 'utter lies'. But the page can no longer be viewed within Russia after a request by the internet watchdog Roskomnadzor, the country's state-backed news agency reported. Facing jail: A Facebook page supporting Russian opposition activist Alexei Navalny (pictured), who is accused of fraud by the Russian authorities, was blocked for non-Russian users sparking an outcry . Watchdog spokesman Vadim Ampelonsky said last night that the page had been blocked on the orders of Russia's general prosecutor. According to the RIA-Novosti news agency, he said the prosecutor 'demanded to limit access to a number of resources calling for an unsanctioned mass event, including social networking groups. 'The demand has been fulfilled.' The decision prompted outrage from Mr Navalny, the leader of Russia's opposition Progress Party, and former U.S. ambassador to Moscow Michael McFaul. 'It's a rather unpleasant and surprising behaviour by Russian Facebook,' wrote Mr Navalny, whose reputation was built up through a prominent anti-corruption blog and online campaigns. Controversial: The blocked page called for an 'assembly' and 'discussion' in Moscow's Manezhnaya Square . 'I thought they would at least demand a court order rather than rush to block pages as soon as crooks from the Roskomnadzor ask.' Mr McFaul added that the block set a 'horrible precedent' and that Facebook should correct its 'mistake' as soon as possible. Supporters quickly signed up onto parallel event pages and made new ones blasting Facebook's 'censorship'. The page called for a rally in Moscow's Manezhnaya Square on January 15, the day the opposition activist will hear the verdict in a major fraud case. Named 'People's Assembly: Discussion of the Navalny brothers' sentence', its description added: 'One for all and all for one. Life's too short to look at the table'. Outcry: Mr Navalny, pictured outside a Moscow court on Friday, turned his ire on the social networking firm . Mr Navalny, a 38-year-old lawyer, is accused with his brother Oleg of embezzling nearly 27million rubles (£300,000) when the Russian arm of cosmetics firm Yves Rocher  used their delivery firm. The case is only one of many against him. A previous probe into embezzlement of a state timber company saw him sentenced to five years, though the sentence was suspended later. In his final word this week Mr Navalny, who has spent almost a year under house arrest, said the case was based on 'utter lies.' He vowed to continue to defy President Vladimir Putin's rule, blaming the government for the rouble collapse and other economic woes and saying that 'it's robbing all of us every day.' Despite these troubles President Putin's approval ratings have soared to more than 80 per cent, bolstered by the annexation of Crimea. Facebook declined to comment, or confirm or deny it was responsible for the page being blocked.","Page organised Moscow rally to back opposition leader Alexei Navalny .

"Frightening: John Whittingdale, Tory chairman of the Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said Britain is losing the information war . Russia and China are winning a propaganda war because of cuts to the BBC World Service, a senior MP has warned. As a result Britain is failing to counter the biased information put out by the two superpowers, said John Whittingdale, Tory chairman of the Commons culture, media and sport select committee. ‘We are being outgunned massively by the Russians and Chinese. It is frightening the extent to which we are losing the information war,’ he said. And Peter Horrocks, who stepped down as head of the World Service this month, claims cuts to its budget could put UK national interests at risk. ‘Medium to long term there has to be an anxiety about the spending of others compared to what the BBC are putting into it. 'You can take a view of the overall national interest and things we spend on international influence, like military spending. When you look at that it would take it in a certain direction.’ Funding for the World Service switched this year from the Foreign Office to the BBC and now comes out of the licence fee. Although in June 2013, the BBC Trust announced that the World Service budget would rise from £238.5million to £245million, it follows years of cuts. In 2010, the Foreign Office cut the World Service budget by 16 per cent. Kremlin-backed news channel Russia Today, which David Cameron accused of ‘pumping out a distorted picture’ of events in Ukraine, will see its budget increased by 40 per cent next year to £220million. It has opened a UK-focused channel and claims a global audience of 644million in 100 countries, compared with the World Service’s 191.4million. Impact: Peter Horrocks, pictured, who stepped down as head of the World Service this month, claims cuts to its budget could put UK national interests at risk. World Service funding was cut by 16 per cent in 2010 . However, since the troubles ignited in Ukraine, with Russian troops moving into the east of the country, demand for the World Service has soared. The corporation’s Russian-language service has more than doubled to 6.9 million listeners, while in Ukraine its audience has trebled to more than 600,000 since last year. Whittingdale has said he will seek assurances from James Harding, the head of BBC News, that the World Service will be maintained as a counterweight broadcasters such as Russia Today. He said: ‘The clear commitment that has been given by Russia and China [to expand state-run news channels in Europe] strengthens the case why we should be backing the World Service.’","John Whittingdale said we are losing information war to 'frightening extent'

"This police department in New York is keeping the Christmas spirit alive. After a burglar stole a White Plains family's Christmas presents from under the tree, police there stepped it up and played Santa. White Plains police presented the Cuenca-Orzuna family Saturday with $1,500 worth of gift cards and several toys. Officers raised the money, with contributions from their union and police officials, after the family's apartment was ransacked last week. The White Plains home of the Cuenca-Orzuna family (pictured) was recently broken into, and all the children's toys were stolen from right under the tree. Luckily, local cops were there to help . 'We had to do something,' Detective German Lopez told The Journal-News. 'We couldn't let these kids go without a Christmas.' Lopez says the thief or thieves took the gifts awaiting the family's four children, plus presents for several cousins. 'I was very angry about this,' he told the Journal-News. 'I have kids and grandchildren myself, so I can imagine what the Orzunas must have felt when their kids' presents were stolen.' Even the children's piggy banks were gone. 'I found a lot of kids crying,' said Lopez, a 23-year police veteran who responded to the call about the burglary, to the Journal-News. It happened while dad Rogelio Orzuna was at his job as a cook, and mom Maria Cuenca was running errands. 'The door was pried open, all the lights were on and our clothes were thrown all over the floor,' mother-of-four Cuenca told the Journal-News. 'Then I saw that all of the presents were gone, and my heart just broke.' Cops from the White Plains PD donated $1,500 in cash and toys to help put this family's Christmas back together . Lopez says officers felt they 'couldn't let these kids go without a Christmas.' Cuenca says the children couldn't be more excited. 'I couldn't believe it when Detective Lopez told me what the police were doing for us,' the mom told the Journal-News. 'Now we can get all the presents back and Christmas isn't ruined. We're very thankful.'","The home of the Cuenca-Orzuna family in White Plains was ransacked by a heartless burglar, who stole their presents from under the Christmas tree .

A group of 12-year-old girls were left in tears after being hauled out of a cinema by police when staff falsely accused them of recording The Hunger Games on their mobiles and iPads. The seven children, who attend one of the country’s leading independent girls’ schools, were quizzed after staff dialled 999 and reported the allegation as an ‘emergency’. Officers in two police patrol cars responded with flashing blue lights and rushed to the Cineworld cinema in Brighton Marina, East Sussex. The sobbing friends, who had been watching The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1, were marched out and accused of breaking copyright laws by making illegal recordings. But when officers examined the distressed girls’ mobile phones they could not find any evidence of wrongdoing and the children were released. However, four of the girls were too traumatised to go back into the cinema and were left to wait sobbing outside in the dark for their parents to pick them up at the end of the 12A certificate film as arranged. Louise Lawrence, 52, of Saltdean, Brighton, whose daughter Tanith was among the group said the parents only discovered what had happened when they arrived to collect the girls. ‘I feel absolutely furious about it,’ she said. ‘Three of the girls didn’t even have mobile phones. They were separated and interrogated by the police. These are children who have never had any contact with the police before, so they were absolutely terrified. Afterwards my daughter said to me, “Mummy I was too frightened to even cry”.’ Sussex Police have since apologised for any upset caused and sent a sergeant to the girls’ £30,000-a-year school to explain why they decided to attend the incident. However some of the parents have now written to Cineworld to complain about the treatment and the cinema’s refusal to refund the children for missing the film. Mrs Lawrence, who runs a coffee shop in Brighton, added: ‘What worries me most is that it was around 7.30pm and it was pitch black. ‘Some of the girls were standing outside in tears and alone yet nobody at Cineworld checked to see if they were okay afterwards. ‘Neither the police nor cinema staff had bothered to call their parents after the incident, even though they knew they were children and only 12 years old. ‘The police have apologised and put things right by visiting the girls’ school but the cinema has done nothing and has refused to refund the children or apologise. A group of seven 12-year-old girls were left in tears after they were hauled out of the cinema by police and wrongly accused of filming a screening of The Hunger Games on their smartphones and iPads . Staff at Cineworld said it took its responsibility to protect copyright seriously but has apologised to the girls . ‘The girls together must have spent at least £100 on their tickets, popcorn and drinks and they didn’t even get to enjoy the film which was something they had been terribly excited about.’ She went on to say: ‘You expect the cinema would have some sort of duty of care or some policy in place while dealing with minors. ‘Our girls were falsely accused, had the police called on them and then just left in tears. It’s outrageous. If they have done this to our children they will do it again.’ A spokesman for Cineworld insisted the cinema chain had contacted the parents and ‘apologised for the distress caused’. She added: ‘While we regret that the customers felt distressed, we are confident that the correct procedures were followed. ‘If our staff see such behaviour we expect them to notify the cinema management immediately and to call the police. However, we have taken on board the concerns expressed by the parents and we are reviewing how the policy is applied to younger customers.’","Group of seven 12-year-old went to watch The Hunger Games in Brighton .

"He may not have arrived on a sleigh being pulled by reindeer, but Santa Claus came to a man’s rescue in the Hunter Valley over the weekend. To get into the Christmas spirit Nick Carey had been dressing up as Santa Claus while working with his crew from NSW Fire & Rescue Telarah brigade, but instead of delivering presents on Saturday he delivered a 20-year-old man from death after he had been pulled from his burning house unconscious suffering from smoke inhalation. The Daily Telegraph reported the fire crew had been on their annual Christmas lolly run in their tinselled fire truck when they saw smoke coming from a house. Instead of coming down the chimney Santa waited outside as his helpers - the rest of the fire crew - broke down the front door and went in using breathing apparatus. But Mr Carey soon jumped into action. Scroll down for video . Nick Carey dressed as Santa Claus was one of the NSW Fire & Rescue Telarah brigade crew that dealt with a house fire in the Hunter Valley on Saturday . “The BA (breathing apparatus) crew radioed­ that they’ve found someone inside so I went up to the front door to help carry him out,” Mr Carey explained. After helping to carry him to the front lawn Santa then started doing CPR on the 20-year-old. The man began breathing again thanks to the speedy work by Mr Carey and his colleagues. Mr Carey had to perform CPR on the 20-year-old victim who had been carried from the house . 'I think the beard and the hat came off when we started the resuscitation,' Mr Carey told the Daily Telegraph. 'It’s definitely the weirdest and most awkward situation I’ve found myself in.' But when the truck turned on to nearby Marlborough St the crew noticed the fire. Neighbour Michael Johnson said everything appeared normal as the fire truck made its way past his house, but this soon changed. When Mr Johnson went around the corner a few minutes later he saw Santa Claus trying to revive a man lying on the ground unconscious. 'This young bloke is nearly dead and Santa Claus is bringing him back to life. It’s the ultimate Christmas present anyone could ever get,' he said. Spreading some Chrismas cheer: Santa and the fire crew successfully put out the fire .","Fireman dressed up as Santa helps to save the life of man in house fire .

"Former AC/DC drummer Phil Rudd has revealed that the criminal charges against him have done little to destroy his rock and roll spirit, as he declares that he wants his job back - and his reputation. Despite the 60-year-old currently being before the New Zealand courts on charges of threatening to kill and possession of methamphetamine and cannabis, Rudd told ONE News that he planned to enjoy his time by 'fishing, flying and fornicating'.

"Row: Éric Zemmour, pictured, appeared to suggest all 5million of France's Muslims should be deported . France is engulfed in a free speech row after a TV commentator was sacked for appearing to suggest all 5million of the country's Muslims should be deported to prevent civil war. The comments by Éric Zemmour, who has previously been convicted of inciting racial hatred, prompted outrage and led to him being dropped from an 11-year stint on a chat show. But many sprang to the best-selling author's defence including the far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen, who declared the move 'loathsome censorship'. Mr Zemmour's interview with Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera went largely unnoticed on the other side of the Alps for more than a month after it appeared in October. It sparked a public debate, however, after the comments were picked up by former French education minister Jean-Luc Mélenchon. Although the original interview has been deleted from Corriere della Sera's website, it was copied and translated several times by people on both sides of France's political divide. In the interview Mr Zemmour said Muslims 'live among themselves' in suburbs which French people have been forced to leave, according to one of his supporters. The interviewer then asked: 'Then what are you suggesting? To deport 5million French Muslims?' Mr Zemmour is said to have replied: 'I know it's unrealistic, but history is often surprising. 'Who would have thought in 1940 that a million pieds-noirs [Europeans living in North Africa], twenty years later, would have left Algeria to return to France? 'Or that after the war five or six million Germans would leave Central-Eastern Europe where they had lived for centuries?' 'Censorship': The sacking was seized upon by French National Front leader Marine Le Pen, pictured . The interviewer protested that Mr Zemmour was 'speaking of exoduses triggered by immense tragedies', to which he replied: 'I think we are heading for chaos. 'This situation of a people inside a people, of Muslims inside French people, will lead us to civil war. 'Millions of people live here in France and refuse to live in the French manner.' The controversy sparked a Twitter campaign with the hashtag #ZemmourDeporteMoi - Zemmour would deport me - and outrage among leading French politicians. France's interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve wrote: 'I am committed to the fight against racism & anti-Semitism to preserve the republican pact and guarantee of our living together #Zemmour'. Bruno Le Roux, the leader of the Socialist Party in France's national assembly, said Mr Zemmour's inspiration appeared to date back to thinking from the Second World War. Tension: France is one of the few countries to ban religious veils in schools (posed by model) 'It's time for TV shows and newspaper columns to cease harbouring such statements,' he wrote on his blog. 'Islamophobia is racism and is not part of the Republic.' Others - including the journalist himself - hit back at what they described as politically-correct censorship. On Friday the iTELE channel, where Mr Zemmour has made a regular appearance on a debating show since 2003, said it had cancelled the latest episode and he would no longer appear. The channel's director Céline Pigalle told French newspaper Le Figaro, for which Mr Zemmour is also a columnist: 'We are very careful to respect freedom of expression.' She said the channel had hosted the controversial journalist for more than a decade 'so that his ideas are taken into account, contradicted and discussed'. But she added: 'Now it seems that it is he who sets the rules and what we are talking. It was less and less the feeling that we can debate. 'The dialogue has become increasingly difficult, if not impossible.' France's population of 5million Muslims is the largest of any country in Europe, and France also has the largest Jewish diaspora on the continent. Mr Zemmour's parents were Jewish Berbers who emigrated from Algeria in the 1950s. His book The French Suicide, which argues France's identity is being destroyed by factors including immigration, homosexuality and feminism, has sold more than 250,000 copies. In 2011 he was convicted of inciting racial hatred in France after telling a chat show most drug dealers were 'blacks and Arabs. That's a fact'.","Interview with Éric Zemmour prompted outrage among French Left .

"Boris Johnson wants raising wages further to be the guiding ‘Conservative economic mission’ in the next Parliament . Boris Johnson wants raising wages further to be the guiding ‘Conservative economic mission’ in the next Parliament. The London Mayor, a leading contender to succeed David Cameron, believes reforms to make work pay should be ‘front and centre’ in the next phase of economic recovery. His backing for a higher minimum wage allies him with Chancellor George Osborne and business minister Matthew Hancock, who have both been pushing the independent commission which sets its rate for above-inflation rises. Mr Johnson also wants the Conservatives to consider tax breaks for firms paying the ‘living wage’, set above the national minimum wage of £6.50 an hour. The living wage is set at £7.85 an hour outside London and £9.15 in the capital. The Mayor does not believe it should become compulsory for firms to pay the living wage, but wants the Tories to consider incentives to persuade more to do so. He is thought to have studied a move by the Labour-run council in Brent to offer lower business rates to companies that guarantee to pay their workers at least the living wage. A friend of the London Mayor said: ‘This is what Conservatives do well – it should be front and centre. ‘The Conservatives should be championing it [the living wage] because it rewards staff, engenders loyalty, and increases productivity - that means growth.’ As the economic recovery has gathered pace, Labour has made slow wage growth central to its attack on the Government’s economic record. There is growing political concern over Britain’s army of low-paid workers, with both Labour and the Tories setting out plans to increase low wages. Last week, the Chancellor called on the Low Pay Commission for further above inflation increases in the statutory minimum wage. In October, more than a million workers got a pay rise as the minimum wage was increased by 19p to £6.50 an hour. It meant those on the lowest legal wage are set to see their pay rise by as much as £355 a year. Chancellor George Osborne and business minister Matthew Hancock have also been pushing for the minimum wage to be upped . The pay rise it the first real terms cash increase since 2008, following recommendations from the Low Pay Commission after pressure from ministers. Ed Miliband has said he wants to increase the minimum wage to £8 an hour by 2019. Mr Osborne has proposed a legal minimum of £7 far sooner. The number of people on the National Minimum Wage has doubled since it was introduced 15 years ago and is now the pay rate for one in 20 workers, according to the think-tank the Resolution Foundation. Around 1.2 million employees earn the legal minimum wage compared with just over 600,000 in 1999. A further 1.3m workers are clustered close to the minimum wage - earning within 50p of the minimum level. It means one in ten workers are poorly paid. Despite this year’s boost, a series of below-inflation increases mean it is worth the same in real terms as it was in 2005.","Boris Johnson wants raising wages further to be 'Tory economic mission'

"An Australian man convicted of the notorious 'body in the bath' murder of his fiancee has been freed on bail after spending 20 years behind bars. Henry Victor Keogh, 57, was jailed for a minimum of 25 years when he was convicted of murdering his fiancee Anna-Jane Cheney, then 29, in their bath in March 1994. In a landmark legal decision, Mr Keogh was granted a retrial after an appeal brought before Adelaide Supreme Court on Monday. Scroll down for video . Henry Victor Keogh, 57, leaves court on bail on Monday after spending 20 years in gaol for the murder of his fiancee Anna-Jane Cheney, then 29, in March 1994 . Ms Cheney's death was initially not treated as suspicious, until the then-chief forensic pathologist for South Australia, Colin Manock, claimed he had evidence pointing towards bruising on her ankles. Mr Mancock alleged that this was consistent with the theory of forcible drowning, alleging that Mr Keogh, then 35, murdered his fiancee by grabbing her ankles, reported The Australian. The Court of Criminal Appeal ruled last Friday that Keogh should be granted the retrial, saying that there had been a substantial miscarriage of justice. Mr Keogh, a former ­financier and insurance broker, was released on bail on Monday, which will see him home with his family for the first time in 20 years, a decision which was welcomed. In a landmark legal decision, Mr Keogh was granted a retrial after an appeal brought before Adelaide Supreme Court on Monday . Mr Keogh outside court in 1994, when he was first convicted for the murder of Ms Cheney . Mr Mancock alleged that this was consistent with the theory of forcible drowning, alleging that Mr Keogh, then 35, murdered his fiancee, Anna-Jane Cheney (right), by grabbing her ankles and holding them above her head . Alexis Atkins, who was nine when her father was taken into custody, has visited her father in jail since his incarceration. The 29-year-old labelled the Court's decision 'really quite surreal,' reported The Advertiser. 'Obviously, it’s really exciting and what we’ve been waiting 20 years for. I think the biggest thing I’m looking forward to is being able to spend time with him without there being time constraints or security guards watching over us, Mrs Atkins said. Compelling evidence was provided that aspects of Ms Cheney's autopsy lacked substantiation, and Ms Mancock recanted on evidence he had provided at Keogh's trial, the court heard. In September Flinders University Professor Anthony Thomas told the Court that evidence was either incomplete or in disarray, reported The Advertiser. Professor Thomas also drew the Court's attention to the swelling of Ms Cheney's face, which may have indicated she suffered an allergic reaction to an anti-histamine drug she had taken prior to her death. Alexis Atkins (left), who was nine when her father was taken into custody, has called the decision 'surreal' Legal crusader and a supporter of Mr Keogh, Professor Bob Moles said that an independent forensic expert had been commissioned by Solicitor General in 2004, 'which came back and said that no murder had occurred' Mr Keogh's brother, David Keogh, said that it would take some time for his brother to readjust to life . Legal crusader and a supporter of Mr Keogh, Professor Bob Moles said that an independent forensic expert had been commissioned by Solicitor General in 2004, 'which came back and said that no murder had occurred'. Professor Moles also told A Current Affair that the family were 'very disappointed that it’s taken so long to get here,' but that it was a tremendous day. 'He will feel relieved that the torment is over, but this will be difficult because this stems from the death of his fiancée,' said Professor Moles. Keogh will be the first person to be granted a full bench for a second time, under a new law introduced in South Australia in 2013. In a statement outside court, David Keogh said his brother would not comment on the case as it remained before the courts. But he thanked Keogh's lawyers and the many supporters who had contributed to his brother's legal fight. 'Today is a day to be hugely grateful for the progress thus far,' said Mr Keogh. 'Adjustment to normal life will be extraordinarily difficult after almost 20 years of incarceration,' he said. 'He asks you all for some space to allow him to begin the process, surrounded by the people who love and care for him.' A large group of Mr Keogh's supporters gathered outside court and cheered as he stepped outside for the first time and made his way into a waiting car. Before Monday's decision, Mr Keogh had launched five mercy petitions to the South Australian Governor, insisting upon his innocence. He has still not received a response from his last petition, which was lodged in 2009. The matter will return to court on February 2. In a landmark legal decision, Mr Keogh was granted a retrial after an appeal brought before Adelaide Supreme Court on Monday .","Henry Victor Keogh was convicted for the murder of his fiancee, 29-year-old Anna-Jane Cheney, in 1994 .

"Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak is now one step closer to becoming an Australian citizen. The multi-millionaire California native was officially granted permanent residency status by the Aussie government over the weekend thanks to his status as a distinguished person. 'Woz' as he's affectionately known says he'll likely pursue full Australian citizenship when his busy travel schedule finally settles down. Woz in Oz: Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak officially became a permanent resident of Australia over the weekend . 'It took a long time and cost some money, but we have done it for our entire family, so we can all reside here,' Woz told Australian Financial Review. Wozniak has a son who who's married to an Aussie and lives in Sydney, notes the International Business Times. He also teaches classes at the University of Technology in Sydney, where he became an adjunct professor after the school extended him an invitation to work there. According to the AFR, Woz first applied for citizenship back in 2012 when he cited the country's rollout of a national broadband network among his reasons for wanting a new passport. He's since made arrangements to have more aspects of his day-to-day life moved Down Under. Family affair: Wozniak had already accepted a teaching position at the University of Technology in Sydney, the same city where the tech whiz's son lives . Wozniak still keeps speaking engagements worldwide, prohibiting him from residing in Australia full-time. But when things slow down, Woz says he intends to settle in Australia for the remainder of his days . For now, his international speaking arrangements prevent him from spending all his time in the far off country. When things settle down, he says he wants to call Australia home. 'I want to be a distinguished part of this country and some day I may say I lived and died an Australian, and that would be a really nice thing to be able to say. No country is perfect, but I like a lot of things about this place,' he said. More specifically, Woz says its the little island of Tasmania south of Melbourne that he'd like to call home. 'The Premier of Tasmania actually called us at our home and offered to show us around if we were ever there. Hopefully in the next few days we can get there, as I really like the idea of cooler weather,' he said.","The millionaire tech genius has already been granted residency in Australia by virtue of being a distinguished person .

"A 13-year-old schoolboy has been told he must stay in isolation until his short back and sides haircut grows out, which could take months. Kyle Gibbs was separated from his classmates and told he would not be allowed to socialise with his friends after teachers ruled that his traditional style flouted the school's strict hair length rules. The Year 9 pupil at Churchdown Academy, Gloucestershire, must now work on his own in a classroom from 8am until 5pm until his hair grows to an 'acceptable length'. His father Colin, from lmbridge, Gloucester, said the school's decision was 'madness' and insisted the young footballer's haircut is 'neat and tidy and totally unremarkable'. Kyle Gibbs, 13, has been told he must stay in isolation until his short back and sides haircut grows out, which could take months . 'The school called and I asked what he had done wrong and when they said it was his haircut I thought they were joking,' he said. 'I was shocked. I cut his hair and he has a neat short back and sides. It is grade 0.5 at the back and longer on top, in an old fashioned style like every boy used to get at the barbers. I couldn't believe it. 'The school said he would have to stay in isolation, on his own in a classroom from 8am until 5pm until his hair grows back. It is not his hair that is doing his reading and writing for him. This is madness. 'It is not like he has a Mohican or strips shaved into the sides. I could understand that might be a distraction to other pupils in class, but his haircut is neat and tidy and totally unremarkable.' His father Colin said the school's decision was 'madness' and insisted the young footballer's haircut is 'neat and tidy and totally unremarkable' The Year 9 pupil at Churchdown Academy, Gloucestershire, must now work on his own in a classroom . Kyle has been told school policy states his hair can't be any shorter than a grade two. This is not the first time the 13-year-old has landed himself in trouble for dodging school uniform regulations. He had been taking part in trials with Birmingham City FC and wore black trainers to school as he had a heel injury. Despite the fact that he told teachers wearing smart shoes was painful, he was told that trainers were not appropriate for school. There is no legislation relating to pupils' uniform or appearance, which is left up to school's governing bodies to decide. But schools often impose bans on 'extreme' haircuts or colours as part of their broader uniform policy. The Department of Education does advise that pupils who don't comply to uniform rules can be disciplined in accordance with the school’s published behaviour policy. A head teacher may ask a pupil to go home briefly to remedy the breach. But if the student takes longer than is strictly necessary to effect the change, then the pupil’s parents must be notified and the absence should be recorded. If a school is considering excluding a pupil in response to breaches of uniform policy then this must be in line with the legal requirements for exclusion. 'I have been into the school to speak with the head teacher,' said Mr Gibbs. 'He said it was school policy and he was backed by the governors. Kyle doesn't feel comfortable in school and I'm not going to let the teachers dictate my son's hairstyle.' Head teacher Christopher Belli took over at the school in September and said in a welcome address that there would be a 'relentless focus on high standards'. The uniform policy states hair should be: 'Natural colour and words or emblems should not be shaved in hair'. Churchdown School Academy has declined to comment. Schools across the country have been enforcing strict uniform policies in the past few years in an attempt to raise standards. Last week it emerged that Liam Pegg, 12, was also separated from his classmates after staff ruled his 'mowhawk' style did not fit with uniform policies  - despite having the cut for a year. He will be forced to study on his own at Nailsea School, North Somerset, until his 'extreme' haircut grows out. And Anthony Mousiou, 12, is also being taught in isolation at Samuel Ryder Academy, Hertfordshire, because his hair cut was too short - by just 4.5 millimetres.","Kyle Gibbs was told he must be taught in isolation until his hair grows back .

"A pensioner has been rescued after spending six days trapped in her bath thanks only her postman who grew worried when she did not answer the door. The woman, named Huguette, who lives by herself in the southern French town of Saint-Antoine-de Breuilh in Dordogne, was about to use the toilet when she slipped and fell in her bathtub, according to The Local. When the woman, who is understood to be in her eighties, found herself unable to extract herself from the tub alone, she reached for her emergency alarm that she had left on the basin. Trapped: The woman, named Huguette, was about to use the toilet when she slipped and fell in her bathtub (stock image) But she could not reach the device leaving her stuck in the bath with no way of getting out. As the days passed, nobody came to her rescue and she was forced to drink water from the tap to survive. Postal worker Silvette Villaud delivered her mail after three days, she noticed something strange about the house. 'I rang the bell but there was no answer. I found it strange because the front door and the window shutters were wide open,' Silvette Villaud told local daily Sud-Ouest. Nonetheless her suspicions were not aroused sufficiently to raise the alarm and she went away. But when she returned three days later, she saw the door and windows were still open. The woman, in her 80s, lives by herself in the southern French town of Saint-Antoine-de Breuilh in Dordogne (pictured, the town hall) 'I said to myself 'That's enough, there's a problem here,' she said. 'I hadn't done that route for very long but I knew an elderly woman lived there, so I went to the Town Hall to alert them.' Cristian Gallot, mayor of Saint-Antoine-de Breuilh, took it upon himself to investigate the alert and borrowed a spare set of keys from a neighbour. Upon entering the home he found Huguette lucid but exhausted. 'I was shocked by how clear her voice sounded,' he said. Firemen were called to assist her out of the bathtub upon which the octogenarian asked for nothing but a glass of milk with a teaspoon of sugar.

"A thief who stole a collection of military medals awarded to a medic in the First World War and then sold them to a pawnbroker for just £25 walked free from court yesterday. Gary Williams told the court his behaviour was the result of his own sense of 'loss' following two bereavements. The 49-year-old said the death of his father and brother in 2013 had clouded his judgement and left him feeling depressed. Williams was handed a 12-month sentence, suspended for 18 months, and was ordered to carry out 100 hours unpaid work. The medic, Thomas Henry Lord's granddaughter, Jean Sanderson, 66, last night condemned the lenient sentence and Williams' justification for committing the crime. The retired night care assistant said: 'I have had bereavements in my family, I've had a horrible year, these things happen but it doesn't turn me into a criminal. 'It makes me so angry that people get a clever lawyer in order to wriggle get out of things. In Tudor times they would have been hung for less and my grandfather would have been disgusted at the kid gloves treatment this man got.' She said her grandfather had volunteered to fight in the war, but because of his age he had to join the ambulance service. Mrs Sanderson said: 'He must have seen a lot and it must have affected him. 'What loss Williams has suffered does not even compare to the suffering my grandfather saw during the war. What that man did to us was damn right cruel. I feel violated that he had been rummaging about especially after I'd trusted him to do work on my house.' The court was told the military medals had been awarded to Mr Lord for serving in the Middle East. Joining up as the war in 1914, Mr Lord helped tend to the wounded on the battlefields and recover the bodies of the dead. He served as a medic in the horrific Mesopotamian campaign against the Ottoman Empire and in Alexandria in Egypt. Mr Lord died in 1940 and his solid-silver medals - a 1914/15 Star, British War Medal and Allied Victory Medal – eventually ended up with Mrs Sanderson. Thomas Henry Lord, seated, was awarded the medals for serving as a medic during the First World War . Mr Lord's granddaughter, Jean Sanderson condemned the sentence handed to Williams and his justification for committing the crime . But Williams, a builder, spotted the medals through a bedroom window as he was fixing her roof in Burnley. He then stole them after he asked to use the toilet. Williams sold them to a pawnbroker for £25 and they were subsequently sold on for £50. They were returned when the pawnbroker read a public appeal about the theft and tipped off police. Philip Holden, mitigating, said: 'The offence was out of character. Mr Williams has experienced life events that have affected his ability to think clearly. The loss of his father and brother impacted on him. The bereavements took place at the end of 2013 some months before the commission of these offences. Passing sentence, Recorder Michael Blakey told him: 'I accept this was impulsive. This clearly crosses the custodial threshold - but for reasons outlined it needn't be an immediate custodial sentence. Williams served as a medic in the horrific Mesopotamian campaign against the Ottoman Empire and in Alexandria in Egypt and was awarded a 1914/15 Star, British War Medal and Allied Victory Medal . 'You have had bereavements during your life but people in similar circumstances do not resort to what you did. Ordinarily I would have no hesitation sending you to prison. 'But I am mindful of your early guilty plea, this offence is out of character, clinically you have a depressive illness and are receiving counselling, you have lost your reasonably good character. As a consequence your life has changed, you are on benefits. A great deal of these are punishments in themselves.' Mrs Sanderson, a grandmother-of-three, said: 'People like him are the lowest of the low and thanks to him, I don't trust anyone to come to my house anymore - and that's not fair on the honest people. 'It's sad that we live in this sort of world. I'm sure my grandfather would have never have suspected this sort of callous betrayal back home when he was serving his country.'","Gary Williams was fixing Jean Sanderson's roof when he saw the medals .

"This is home of a neonatal nurse who lay dead for seven years before her 'mummified' body was finally discovered by bailiffs. Tragic Anne Leitrim, 58, was being investigated for 'inappropriate conduct towards a child' at work shortly before her death, an inquest heard. Neighbours at the block of flats in Bournemouth had assumed the nurse had moved out - even though two windows were left open in the property. But her badly decomposed body was finally found  in June by bailiffs who had been called because of her unpaid mortgage. The mummified body of Anne Leitrim, 58, was discovered at her Bournemouth flat (pictured) in June by bailiffs who had been called because her mortgage had not been paid . Two of the dilapidated windows at the ground floor flat  (pictured) where the body was found, had been left open . A police officer who entered the property in Bournemouth, Dorset, had to wade through a waist-high pile of post in order to get inside. PC Andrew Scarratt found a calendar on the wall dated June 2007 and a TV guide for the week of June 16 that year. Ms Leitrim was under final warning at Homerton University Hospital in east London after a disciplinary hearing on 6 June 2007, Bournemouth Coroner's Court heard. Her body was found near her bed along with a note which read, incorrectly: 'My doctors has done anything wrong. I love my babies. Goodbye Janet.' A post mortem report said that the body was in 'a state of advanced mummification' and a cause of death could not be ascertained because toxicology tests were impossible. Coroner Sheriff Payne said the 'vague' note 'could be treated as a suicide note', but there was no physical evidence at the scene to indicate she had taken her life. It also emerged that she had been taking medication for anxiety and stress for about 10 years. Her GP said he last saw her in June 2007 when she was suffering from a high level of anxiety. Baliffs had also discovered a waist-high pile of post for Ms Leitrim had built up in the hallway of the flats . But all the neighbours at the block of flats in Bournemouth assumed the nurse had moved out, while Ms Leitrim's sister Katherine Clarke said the nurse had had lost contact with the family around 20 years ago . Campaigner Esther Rantzen has urged people to check on their neighbours this Christmas after the case came to light . A waist-high pile of post for Ms Leitrim had built up in the hallway of the flats, where neighbours said they thought she had moved away. Campaigner Esther Rantzen has urged people to check on their neighbours this Christmas, saying it is the perfect time to go round with a card . Her sister Katherine Clarke said that Ms Leitrim had had lost contact with the family around 20 years ago, but they were not sure why. She trained as a nurse, working in Glasgow, Barnet and St Thomas' Hospital in London. Ms Leitrim bought the flat in Bournemouth in the 1970s and continued to work in London, living there while she was on duty. Fiona Kennedy, from Homerton University Hospital in London, said that allegations had been made of inappropriate conduct towards a child in Ms Leitrim's care. She had been given a final written warning, but a back-to-work plan was put in place. Ms Leitrim did not attend further appointments and did not respond to letters and phone calls from the hospital. With no next of kin on file, she was put on unauthorised absence in August 2007 and her employment terminated that November. Coroner Payne said: 'She had no social life down here (in Bournemouth); people didn't know who she was to any great extent.' With no cause of death and no evidence, the coroner said he had no alternative but to record an open verdict. Campaigner Esther Rantzen has urged people to check on their neighbours this Christmas, saying it is the perfect time to go round with a card and a mince pie. She was under final warning at Homerton University Hospital in east London after a disciplinary hearing in June 2007 . 'I think we're different [today] in the sense that we're quite concerned about people's privacy and we don't want to intrude,' she told the Daily Echo. 'At Christmas we don't want that to be on our conscience and it's the perfect time to go round with a Christmas card and a mince pie and make sure that whoever it is, whether an elderly person or a single mum, to bang on the door and wish them a happy Christmas.' Ms Rantzen, who founded Childline and The Silver Line, a helpline for older people, said: 'I think there are a lot of people who should be asking themselves questions [in the case of Miss Leitrim].'","Neonatal nurse Anne Leitrim, 58, had lay dead in her flat for seven years .

"Coles will pay $11.25million in fines and costs but could end up paying more than double that in refunds to suppliers, after a court agreed to the supermarket giant's settlement with the competition watchdog. Federal Court judge Michelle Gordon said Coles had engaged in illegal and unconscionable conduct in its dealings with suppliers, including demanding payments to which it was not entitled to fill its own profit gaps and threatening commercial consequences. Justice Gordon suggested last week the settlement with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) did not involve severe enough penalties but ultimately accepted it, saying on Monday she had taken Coles's admission of wrongdoing into account. Scroll down for video . Coles engaged in illegal and unconscionable conduct in its dealings with suppliers, a court has ruled . The $10 million in fines applies to Coles' treatment of suppliers involving 15 instances and eight suppliers in which it breached consumer law. It threatened commercial consequences including not granting future contracts or promotion of products if it did not pay rebates to Coles to fund a supply chain improvement program or fill profit gaps. In the case of cleaning brand Oates, Coles calculated that its profit from selling Oates products was $326,590 less than the supermarket expected. Coles ordered Oates to repay this amount but refused to explain its calculations. When Oates refused, Coles deducted $246,400 from a payment it owed the company. Oates told Coles this payment was unacceptable and unauthorised, but offered to make monthly payments to repay of $365,200 'to address the Oates purported profit gap' and in exchange for Coles providing Oates with a number of catalogue spots and product trials. Coles accepted the offer despite knowing it had no entitlement to the money. In the case of cleaning brand Oates, Coles calculated that its profit from selling Oates products was $326,590 less than the supermarket expected then demanded this be repayed . When Oates refused, Coles deducted $246,400 from a payment it owed the company . Coles eventually returned the $246,400 that it had withheld from Oates without authority or agreement. More than 200 suppliers will now potentially be able to seek refunds from Coles over extra payments that were demanded to fill in gaps in profit, related to Coles squeezing suppliers when it felt it had not made enough of a profit on products for various reasons such as poor sales, discounts or waste. Former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett will be the independent arbiter who decided whether suppliers should be refunded by Coles. In her judgement, Federal Court judge Michelle Gordon said Coles misused its bargaining power. 'Coles demanded payments from suppliers to which it was not entitled by threatening harm to the suppliers that did not comply with the demand,' Justice Gordon said. 'Coles withheld money from suppliers it had no right to withhold. 'Coles' practices, demands and threats were deliberate, orchestrated and relentless.' The ACCC's court documents released earlier this year included evidence of internal emails from Coles executives detailing an annual 'profit day', in which staff were pushed to squeeze suppliers for payments to fund profit gaps. Coles Managing Director John Durkan said the company 'unconditionally apologises and accepts full responsibility for its actions' ACCC chairman Rod Sims described Coles' conduct as unconscionable, a misuse of market power and unfair profit shifting from suppliers to Coles when the second of two legal cases was brought in October. Coles is the second largest retailer of grocery products in Australia. She noted that Coles now admits that its conduct was contrary to law and involved serious breaches. Coles Managing Director John Durkan repeated last week's apology. He said the company 'unconditionally apologises and accepts full responsibility for its actions in these supplier dealings. 'Coles crossed the line in the supplier dealings in 2011 subject to these proceedings and regrettably treated these suppliers in a manner inconsistent with acceptable business practice.' 'Since these incidents occurred in 2011, Coles has taken many steps to both improve its relationships with suppliers and help its suppliers grow,' he said.","Coles engaged in illegal and unconscionable conduct with suppliers: court .

"U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents shot a Canadian man in the inspection lanes for a bridge linking Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, the agency said Sunday. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) spokesperson Ken Hammond Sr. said in a statement to The Detroit Free Press that two of its agents 'fired their service issued weapons in response to an individual on foot, rapidly approaching the CBP officers, wielding in his hand what appeared to be a black handgun.' Hammond also said that 'One officer fired three rounds, the other fired one round. One round hit the subject in the arm. Investigators determined that the individual was holding a replica of a handgun.' Incident: U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents shot a Canadian man in the inspection lanes for the Ambassador Bridge, pictured . The Canadian man exited his vehicle at approximately 3am, went through the inspection lanes and brandished the supposed gun, according to the newspaper. Citing an earlier U.S. Customs and Border Protection statement, The Detroit Free Press reported that the CBP agents told the Canadian man to let go of the item, but the man refused before he aimed at the agents. Authorities said in the statement cited that the Canadian man was hospitalized and later released into custody. Multiple agencies were investigating the shooting on the bridge, Hammond's statement to The Detroit Free Press said. Hammond also said that five witnesses spoke with authorities and video was examined. The newspaper noted the man was involved in an incident with Windsor, Ontario, police officers less than an hour before he was shot by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents. In a release posted on Facebook, Windsor police spokesman Sgt. Matthew D'Asti said that officers went to a Windsor McDonald's  after a caller reported at about 2:40am an armed man at the restaurant's parking lot. Review: CBP spokesperson Ken Hammond Sr. has said that multiple agencies were investigating the shooting  (file photo) 'Officers observed the suspect vehicle in the McDonald's parking lot,' D'Asti said. 'As officers arrived, a male exited the vehicle holding a firearm in his hand. The suspect began to walk in the direction of the McDonald's and was ordered at gunpoint to drop his weapon. The suspect then turned in the direction of the officers and pointed the firearm in their direction.' D'Asti also said that 'The suspect stated to our officers; ""Why haven't you shot me yet?"" Officers continued to attempt to deescalate the situation using tactical communication.' D'Asti said the driver sped off and other law enforcement agencies were contacted. 'Police later learned that the suspect was involved in an incident in the United States with U.S. Customs and Border Protection Officers,' D'Asti said.","US Customs and Border Protection agents shot a Canadian man on a bridge linking Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, Sunday morning .

"Cruel thugs taped a pregnant dog's mouth shut around a firework before lighting it, shattering the animal's jaw. The dog, which had been seriously abused before the attack, was left with missing teeth and burned fur. Vets caring for the animal, which they have named Chola, in the Mexican city of Torreon, fear she may now lose the litter of puppies she was carrying. The pregnant dog was left with a burnt tongue and missing teeth when cruel thugs taped its mouth around a firework before setting it off. She is now recovering under the care of vets in the Mexican city of Torreon . They believe the animal was being used to train less aggressive breeds as fighter dogs before becoming pregnant. It is likely her abusers were trying to kill her when they discovered she was no longer of use to them, vets said. 'She was very badly hurt, it looks as if she may survive now but will no longer be able to have a life on the street and may well still lose the puppies,' said Vet Miguel Davila. 'Many of her injuries such a torn ear are old ones. We believe she was used as bait in dogfights but then became no use when she got pregnant.' The Animal Protection Association is offering a reward for anyone who might be able to identify those responsible for the attack. Vets believe the animal, which they named Chola, may have been used to train less aggressive breeds to fight before becoming pregnant . Aside from the vet giving her medical care and those feeding her, experts are trying to minimise contact with the animal as she is so nervous around humans . 'We have given her a name, called Chola, but to be honest we are avoiding as much contact with her as possible as she is extremely nervous of anybody that she doesn't know well,' said Rebecca Reyes, director of the Association. 'She cannot swallow any food because her palate was burnt badly together with her tongue and so we have to feed her baby food liquidised. 'She also needs painkillers constantly and unless is tranquillised does not allow herself to be examined. 'The explosive device that she had in her mouth not only shattered part of the jaw but knocked out several teeth. It is lucky it didn't go into her lungs, somehow they seem to have been unhurt.' Local police are appealing for donations to help pay for the dog's surgery and ask anyone with information about the attack to come forward.","Pregnant animal was left with missing teeth and a burnt tongue by attack .

"A married couple have been jailed for a total of 19 years for laundering £145million of dirty money through their family-run bureau de change. Moothathamby Sriskantharajah, 59, and his wife Thilageswary, 48, ran what seemed to be a legitimate currency exchange but were in fact cleaning money for dangerous criminal gangs. The couple stashed hundreds of thousands of pounds in safe deposit boxes at luxury store Harrods and used two sisters, unrelated to them, to transport the illicit cash. Married couple Moothathamby (left) and Thilageswary (right) Sriskantharajah have been jailed for a total of 19 years for laundering £145MILLION of dirty money through their family-run bureau de change . The fraudulent four were jailed on Thursday last week at Southwark Crown Court for money laundering after an investigation by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). The Sriskantharajahs ran London stores Universal Money Exchange and Buckingham Money Exchange, with three sites across the capital including one on Oxford Street. They took cash from organised gangs and transferred it into euros believing the authorities couldn't then trace the dirty money. Sisters Marlene and Lucia Cumbo, 53 and 54, both of Islington, north London, acted as their couriers. HMRC officers caught Marlene leaving Harrods with a store bag containing nearly £91,000 in 200-euro notes in August 2011. The couple stashed hundreds of thousands of pounds in safe deposit boxes at luxury store Harrods (pictured) Sisters Marlene (right) and Lucia Cumbo (left) were used by the pair to transport the illicit cash . Officers were searching her home when Lucia arrived carrying an envelope in her handbag with a further £35,000. Peter Millroy, criminal investigation assistant director at HMRC, said: 'This gang of criminals were under the delusion they could escape detection - they were wrong and are now paying the price behind bars. 'Their activities bore no relation to what is expected from high street bureaux de change. Instead they used their business as a front to launder the profits made by many of the UK's most serious and dangerous crime gangs.' The married couple, of Hounslow, west London, denied the offences but were convicted by a jury. Moothathamby was sentenced to 12 years in jail and banned from being a director for 12 years. While Thilageswary was jailed for seven years and banned from being a director for eight years. Marlene admitted the offence and was jailed for three-and-a-half years. Lucia denied her role in the outfit but a jury found her guilty and she was sentenced to two years in jail.

"A baby girl born almost three months prematurely to a mother battling terminal cancer is doing well and gaining strength in the lead-up to Christmas. Michelle Buchholtz, 38, gave birth to Ava at just 29 weeks, in Melbourne on November 14, in a bid to help prolong her own life as she holds out hope of living long enough to take her baby home. The mother had Ava early so she could undergo further cancer treatment as her health slowly deteriorates. At one month old, the baby girl now weighs 1767g after being born a tiny 1kg by caesarean. Scroll down for video . At one month old, baby Ava - who was born at 28 weeks - is doing well . Michelle Buchholtz, 38, gave birth prematurely in a bid to help prolong her own life as she battles terminal cancer . She has moved out of the intensive care unit at the Royal Women's Hospital but will remain at the hospital over Christmas, while her mother also battles on after her latest round of chemo. ‘She’s giving me hope. What I’m going through with the chemotherapy isn’t that easy, but she keeps me strong, seeing her doing so well,’ Ms Buchholtz told the Herald Sun. Ms Buchholtz gave was forced to give birth wearing a neck brace due to fractures caused by her many tumours. 'It was difficult to be totally happy initially, I was looking at her thinking ""Oh My God I'm not going to be here"",' she said at the time. Ava has been moved from the intensive care unit at the Royal Women's Hospital . An update on the family's Facebook fundraising page earlier this month revealed Ava's progress . 'But when they put her on my chest a couple of days later everything sank away.’ Ms Buchholtz and her fiancé, Alex Ansalone, have been trying to raise money for cancer treatment to buy the new family more time together. The couple have terminated two pregnancies since they started trying for a family - once during her first fight with an aggressive stage four breast cancer in 2012. They stored Ms Buchholtz's eggs before she underwent chemotherapy and had a double mastectomy. Michelle Buchholtz  gave birth to Ava at 29 weeks with doctors fearing her cancer riddled body would not cope with a full term pregnancy . Ms Buchholtz and her fiance, Alex Ansalone, have been desperately trying to raise money for cancer treatment to buy the new family more time together . Ms Buchholtz and Mr Ansalone decided to try again for baby Ava when Ms Buchholtz thought she was finally cancer free. But 17 weeks into the pregnancy, her cancer returned and doctors said it had spread to her spine. In just two months, 12 new tumours have grown and spread into her neck, back, pelvis, hip and thigh. 'We've been told her prognosis is not good and there's no cure,' Mr Ansalone told the newspaper. The couple, who have been together since April 2012, welcomed baby Ava in November at the Royal Women’s Hospital in Melbourne . Ms Buchholtz, pictured here pregnant with Ava, was first diagnosed with breast cancer after the couple returned from a trip to Europe in October 2012 . 'So having the baby has been the best thing at this stage. It has helped us push through.' Ms Buchholtz was first diagnosed with breast cancer after the couple returned from a trip to Europe in October 2012. The tumour along with 18 lymph nodes were removed and she had a double mastectomy as a precaution. After a blood test showed Ms Buchholtz was pregnant, the couple decided to terminate the pregnancy so she could undergo intense chemotherapy. The couple managed to fall pregnant naturally following the treatment, but again had to terminate in September last year after learning the child would not survive due to abnormalities. Ava was born via caesarean weighing just 1,056 grams as Ms Buchholtz lay in the hospital bed wearing a neck brace due to fractures caused by her many tumours .

"Jailed: Janine Pickett, 46, plundered customer deposits and rental payments from bank accounts . A businesswoman who led the high life after stealing £375,000 from clients was jailed today. Janine Pickett, 46, plundered customer deposits and rental payments from bank accounts she managed as the franchisee of Dorset Lettings. She used the money to buy several Welsh ponies - one of which cost £7,000 - bought a new BMW on hire purchase, and took several exotic holidays, including trips to Florida, France and cruises around the Mediterranean. Today Pickett, of Gillingham, Dorset, was sent to prison for 32 months by a judge at Dorchester Crown Court after earlier pleading guilty to a charge of fraud by abuse of position. The court heard that between January 2010 and November 2013 Pickett helped herself to the money from the Shaftesbury-based business. Further investigations revealed that Pickett had altered documents including bank statements and financial audit records in an attempt to cover up the theft. Detective Constable Declan Cummings, of Dorset Police, said: ‘Janine Pickett’s selfish actions have had a significant impact on a large number of people. 'Not only the innocent customers who handed over their deposits and rent in good faith, but also Barrie George, who is the owner of the Dorset Lettings brand. Stole cash: From 2010 to 2013, she helped herself to the money from Dorset Lettings (above, in Shaftesbury) ‘He runs three of the six businesses himself and the remaining three are franchised. I hope the sentence handed out today sends a very strong message that crimes such as this will not be tolerated in Dorset.’ Mr George said: ‘On behalf of everyone at Dorset Lettings including the staff, landlords, tenants and suppliers, it is gratifying to see that justice has been served. ‘It has been a particularly stressful time for everybody and hopefully the conclusion of the legal case will help bring closure for all those directly affected. ‘Fortunately, Dorset Lettings is an ethical Arla-licensed agent and client money protection insurance is a condition of the licence. ‘We were able to make claims on behalf of all the landlords involved and facilitated the claims for tenants to get their deposits back. ‘We responded quickly to this crisis and I would like to pay tribute to all the staff who worked tirelessly under the most trying circumstances to help our customers. We continue to go from strength to strength.’ Pickett was well known in the show horse world, having regularly competed at the Gillingham & Shaftesbury, Bath & West and the Dorset and Devon county shows.","Janine Pickett, 46, plundered customer deposits and rental payments .

Ms Harris and her children enjoyed their perfect Christmas watching the Disney parade and meeting their favourite characters . Ms Harris, of Pontardawe, near Swansea, South Wales, said: 'It was my one dream, to take my children to Disneyland' She was only able to book the trip before Christmas, because her friends and family raised £500 . 'I am so grateful for everyone's help in getting me there,' she said, adding her children, pictured, are 'her life' Her children are still too young to fully understand the severity of their mother's condition but they know she isn't well. The single mother was diagnosed with cervical cancer in March last year when doctors found a tumour the size of a grapefruit. After gruelling chemotherapy and internal radiotherapy she was given the all clear. But just months later the cancer had returned in her lungs and bones. Now, she is receiving more chemotherapy and regular blood transfusions because her platelet count is so low, to prolong her life. 'It's every child's dream to visit Disneyland and to be able to give that to my kids while I'm still here was so precious,' she added .

"The first winners of the world's biggest lottery payoff have begun to emerge as they share a €2.5billion (£1.96billion) pot of cash to be divided among thousands of Spanish ticketholders. Neighbourhoods in towns and cities across Spain erupted with Champagne-soaked scenes of joy as it dawned on this year's lucky winners that they had scooped the €400,000 (£314,000) first prize of Spain's 'El Gordo' (The Fat One) Christmas lottery. Unlike lotteries that offer one large jackpot, Spain's yuletide drawing sprinkles a variety of winnings on thousands of ticketholders.

Tickets bearing the lucky first prize number 13437, in what is known as El Gordo - the Fat One - were sold from Lanzarote, in the Canary Islands, to La Coruna, on the north-west tip of mainland Spain. They were sold from the province of Cadiz, just west of Gibraltar, to Barcelona on the Mediterranean coast, just south of the French frontier. A handful of winners came from Valencia on the east coast and in the small town of Coria, a few miles from the Portuguese frontier. Others came from more than a dozen other places across the country including Madrid, the capital.

Tales of joy and celebration are widely broadcast on TV stations, providing Spain's struggling population a rare moment of relief after another year of a brutal financial crisis. Restaurant employee Joana Lizcano beamed as she soaked in the reality of winning the big one after coming to Spain from Colombia as a poor immigrant 14 years ago. 'The first thing I'll do is take my five-year-old daughter to the Disney theme park in Paris,' said Lizcano, 28. 'Then I'll pay the debts I have and try to buy an apartment with my husband.'

Nervous wait: Officials verify the balls in the build-up to the hotly-awaited draw . Photocopy shop manager Arturo Aguirre said his winning ticket would allow him to buy his way out of the debt he racked up amid the crisis that started easing this year, but still hasn't translated into a major financial turnaround for many Spaniards. 'I'll be able to plug the holes that I've got,' Aguirre said. One of the happiest places yesterday was the tiny mountain village of El Bosque, halfway between the sherry capital of Jerez and Ronda, the mountain bullfight town inland from the Costa del Sol. Twenty full first prize tickets were sold in the village of 2,100 inhabitants - that's 29,714 pounds, 28p for every man, woman and child. But for the second year everyone who won anything in the lottery will have to pay 20 percent back to the Treasury in tax. Until last year lottery winnings in Spain were tax free.

"Thousands of travellers saw their holiday plans thrown into jeopardy after power failures struck at Stansted and Gatwick airports. Passengers reported queues stretching the length of the main terminal building for departures at Stansted, where flights were still taking off despite the disruption. Meanwhile a signalling problem at Gatwick meant that no trains could run into or out of the airport's train station for at least 45 minutes - just three days before Christmas. Frustrated passengers found themselves stuck on trains, with many complaining that they were not told whether or not they were likely to arrive at the airport in time for their flights. Scroll down for video . Passengers reported queues stretching the length of the main terminal building for departures at Stansted Airport (file picture) Scrum: Passengers queuing at Gatwick Airport's train station after services were hit by a signalling failure . Cancelled: Many train services were scrapped or delayed in the aftermath of the signalling failure . At Stansted, one passenger tweeted that the mood was turning ugly, with police having to hold back the crowds. The power failure, which started in mid-afternoon, affected a satellite building and the track transit which takes passengers  for boarding. Stansted said neither the main terminal nor the runway were affected and passengers were being taken by bus to their flights. Signalling problems at Gatwick apparently continued all day, because even after the issue was fixed there were tailbacks which lasted several hours and had a knock-on effect on services. This is the second Christmas in a row that Gatwick has faced severe delays - last year, a power outage caused by flooding led to days of chaos at the airport. After today's signal failure, just one Gatwick Express train was running from London Victoria to Gatwick every 45 minutes, compared to every 15 minutes under normal conditions. Southern Trains said a signal problem occurred at 11.45am. Normal service resumed only after 6.15pm last night. The problem had affected services run by the Southern, Gatwick Express, First Great Western and Thameslink train companies. Waiting: Passengers at Victoria station in London faced an anxious wait to see if they would catch the train . Warning: Passengers were told to assume delays of up to 70 minutes on their way to the airport . Passengers were warned to expect delays of up to 70 minutes, which many travellers said would cause them to miss their flights. On Twitter, Iona Spackman posted: ‘It’s the Christmas period you can’t not know how to sort the signal failure or tell your customers how long the delay will last Gatwick!!!!!!’ Others pleaded with airlines to hold up their flights. One Twitter user wrote: ‘@emirates all trains into Gatwick have been stopped, loads of passengers on your flight. Can you delay the flight? #help’. Maria May tweeted: 'Argh stupid Victoria station and Gatwick express - all delayed meaning I missed my flight. 4 hours to kill now at Gatwick.' Chris Grist added: '@GatwickExpress we've been stuck over 40 mins how much longer people are going to miss their flights soon.' And Jodi Gramigni wrote: '@GatwickExpress @GatwickAirport Pls advise on the delay. We have been on the train 1 hour & no info on arrival time. #ChristmasFail.' Scene: Following the delays, parts of Gatwick Airport looked almost totally deserted . Empty: Many customers complained that they were unable to get to the airport in time for their flights . Stansted Airport was also hit by technical problems, as the power failed in a satellite terminal and the track transit which takes passengers there. Authorities said neither the main terminal nor the runway were affected and that passengers were being taken by bus to their flights. At Leeds Bradford airport, 60mph winds meant planes had to abort landing attempts and fly to Manchester instead. Flights from Fuerteventura, in the Canary Islands, and Amsterdam were cancelled. At Dover, ferry passengers were held up by a train that broke down between Sandling and Folkestone West. Buses replaced trains from Ashford International to Dover Priory. Meanwhile, no trains ran between Clapham Junction in London and Milton Keynes due to staff shortages. In Guiseley, Yorkshire, services were cancelled after trees fell on overhead wires, while in Scotland floods stopped trains from Kilmarnock to Dumfries. And drivers sat in traffic for at least three hours on the M6 southbound, with junctions 16 to 17 near Stoke closed after an accident.","Power failure at Stansted Airport cause queues as long as terminal building .

"Britain's hopes of a white Christmas have been dashed as forecasters predicted cold and blustery weather with up to three inches of rain on the way. The only chance of postcard scenes will come with frosts expected overnight on Christmas Day, but they'll be accompanied by freezing fog creating challenging conditions for drivers. The nation was hit by strong winds and flash flooding today as the Christmas week began with a burst of bad weather which hit the transport network. Planes were buffeted from side to side at Leeds Bradford Airport, while dozens of people had to be rescued from a supermarket when they were stranded there by rising flood waters and trains were cancelled across the country. However, the rain is set to be replaced by clear and crisp conditions later this week - meaning there is little prospect of a white Christmas. Bookmakers are offering odds of 12/1 against snow on Christmas Day in London, while the Met Office says the most that can be expected is 'sleety snow on higher ground', which is unlikely to settle. Scroll down for video . Flooding: The train from Glasgow to Carlisle was stuck in floodwater last night as Britain was hit by rain and high winds . Hairy moment: This is when a plane tried to depart from Leeds Bradford Airport in strong winds today . Danger: The airport was hit by gusts which eventually forced the authorities to cancel many of the scheduled flights . Flash flooding hit Scotland last night, with dozens of people rescued from an Asda supermarket after the River Irvine burst its banks due to heavy rains. In Kilmarnock, 42 customers and staff were ferried to safety in rigid inflatable boats after becoming stranded by floodwater at an Asda supermarket shortly after 6.10am. Firefighters attended 11 flood-related incidents in Ayrshire as crews worked to rescue people and clear water from homes after heavy overnight rain. Apassenger was treated for a minor head injury after a train came to a halt when it hit floodwater near Mauchline in Ayrshire at around 12.20am. Fire and rescue crews led more than 30 people to safety after the train became stranded in approximately five feet of water. Firefighters used ladders to create a three-metre bridge from a carriage, which allowed those on board to be led to safety. The flooding has led to severe disruption to train services between Glasgow Central and Newcastle via Carlisle today.

Choppy seas: High winds whipped up the waves of the Irish Sea, leading to dramatic scenes at the Blackpool seafront . At Leeds Bradford Airport, nearly all scheduled flights were delayed or cancelled because of strong winds which left planes visibly struggling to take off and land without being blown around. A spokesman for the airport said that winds of up to 50 knots had meant that many flights had to be diverted to other nearby airports. 'The winds have affected the whole of Yorkshire,' he added. 'It is very frustrating for passengers trying to fly over the Christmas period, but we are hopeful of getting flights back underway later this afternoon.' Passengers flying via Gatwick were also hit by delays, after a signalling problem forced the airport's railway station to shut down temporarily, crippling the local train network. Rail bosses said the the issue was fixed with 45 minutes, but had left a tailback of trains as they tried to regain normal services. Those heading for cross-Channel ferries have also been held up today due to a broken-down train between Sandling and Folkestone West in Kent. Also, staff shortages meant there were no Southern trains between Clapham Junction in south London and Milton Keynes Central in Buckinghamshire.

Chaos: Trains were delayed and cancelled at Gatwick Airport's railway station after it was forced to shut down temporarily . Cumbria Police warned motorists to adjust their speed due to deteriorating road conditions following heavy rain. A number of roads in the county have reportedly flooded, particularly in the central Lakes, including the B5305 at Sour Nook, the A592 between Newby Bridge and Bowness, and the A591 between Rydal Water and Ambleside. Other major roads around the country to be hit by poor conditions included the M62, where speed limits were lowered to 40mph due to strong winds which made driving more dangerous. The Severn Bridge also faced speed restrictions due to the wind, as did the M6 in Cumbria. Weather warnings were issued this morning ahead of showers which were forecast to dump three inches of rain in some areas despite the generally mild weather. The thermometer was today set to reach as much as 12C or 13C in some parts of the country, according to the Met Office, with the South of England and Midlands the warmest areas. But despite the unseasonably mild temperatures, Northern England and Scotland will be hit by at least 1in (30mm) of rain tonight and tomorrow. In the worst-affected areas, such as Cumbria, the Pennines and Snowdonia, 3in (80mm) is expected to fall by tomorrow night.

A spokesman for the bookmaker said: 'At this stage there's more chance of Santa Claus coming down the chimney than the UK waking up to a blanket of white snow on Christmas Day.' It has not snowed on Christmas Day in Britain since 2010, with extreme cold more often seen in January and February. Forecasters are expecting frost overnight on Christmas Day, with freezing fog creating challenging conditions for drivers. Wind and rain will hit the country from Boxing Day, according to Leon Brown of The Weather Channel UK, thanks to low pressure sweeping across Britain, with more showers over the weekend.","There is little prospect of a white Christmas with odds of snow in London at 12/1 against - but there will be frost .

"A war is being waged in a Massachusetts town over the word Christmas. A rift first appeared in the town of Marshfield earlier this year when the schools voted to change the name of Christmas vacation to 'holiday break.' On Saturday, that rift deepened when the Department of Public Works was asked to take down a flashing roadside sign that read 'Merry Christmas to all. In God we trust.' Townspeople in Marshfield, Massachusetts defiantly took to the streets in holiday garb Saturday to wave handmade signs proclaiming 'Merry Christmas' to passersby after city officials forced the removal of a roadside sign that read 'Merry Christmas to all - In God we trust' War on Christmas: The local Department of Public Works union posted the sign and said it was merely an innocent gesture . A group soon took to the streets while decked out in holiday garb and elf costumes where they waved 'Merry Christmas' signs and wished passersby a happy holiday. The sign was placed there by public works employee and local union chairman Steve Barber, who called the sign 'perfectly innocent.' 'We’re the guys who take care of the town, and we’re proud of it,' Barber told the Patriot Ledger. 'We just wanted to decorate and wish everyone a Merry Christmas.' Supporters of the sign, most of whom were against the September measure to change the name of Christmas vacation, went public with their outrage after city officials had the sign removed. 'This is America the last time I looked,' one Marshfield bus driver told WBZ. 'We were founded on Christianity and it seems to me like Christianity is starting to be wiped out. It’s the melting pot. Melt and merge.' She was among those proudly holding signs that read 'Merry Christmas' over the weekend, as was Laurie Futch, who told My Fox Boston: . 'This is America, right? It's up to the individual. If you want to say ""Merry Christmas,"" you should be able to. If you want to say ""Happy holidays,"" then say it.' In November, a special meeting of the Marshfield was held to address the change of their winter break name from Christmas vacation to holiday break. Too politically correct? The protesters say a war is being waged on Christmas in their town and point to a recent school board vote to change the name of Christmas vacation to holiday break to prove it . 'This is America, right?': Residents of the town of 24,000 who want to bring the word Christmas back, like Laurie Futch, say their rights are being taken away. 'It's up to the individual,' Futch said . Even when nearly a fifth of the city's 24,000 residents signed a petition asking that the name be changed back, the board voted the request down. Elaine Taylor, who presented the 4,000-plus signatures to the committee, told WBZ: . 'Some people have other holy days on their calendars because that’s their community and what they believe...But our community is Christian, and we should be able to hold on to those traditions.'","A rift has deepened in the town of Marshfield, where the Department of Public Works was asked to take down signs reading 'Merry Christmas'

'Once we realised it was £3million neither of us knew what to do next - so I called my mum and my husband called his dad, and by this time, it must have been after 11pm.' Lotto can only roll over four times and as no one matched all six numbers in the draw on December 17, the prize money was shared between the five winners in the next winning prize level, with each winner getting more than £3million. After spending the next few hours looking at her phone rather than sleeping, Mrs Burston received an email from The National Lottery confirming she had won the prize, although she carried on checking until the morning. Mrs Burston, who has two young children, says she plans to use her winnings to buy a larger home because her family was starting to outgrow their three bed semi detached. She also plans to spend some of the cash on her family, and although she and service engineer Mr Burston, 30, had already booked a holiday to Turkey next summer, she said they may try to 'squeeze in another one.' Mrs Burston, who has been married for two and a half years, went back to work part time a month ago after the birth of her second child, and has already been back in since her big lottery win, saying: 'You can’t let people down, can you?' She added: 'I keep asking myself, just how do you spend that sort of money? 'I’m sure with £3million in the bnk the knack will come for us.'","Jenn Burston, 27, from Exeter played a chance Lucky Dip game online .

"Tunisian politican Beji Caid Essebsi has won the country's first free presidential election . Tunisian politician Beji . Caid Essebsi won the country's first free presidential election, . in the final step of a transition to democracy after an uprising . that ousted autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali in 2011. Essebsi beat rival and incumbent Moncef Marzouki with 55.68 . per cent of the vote against 44.32 per cent in yesterday's run-off . ballot between the two men, according to results released by the electoral authorities today. A former official under Ben Ali, Essebsi recast himself as a . technocrat. His secular party Nidaa Tounes - Call for Tunisia - . profited from a backlash against the post-revolt Islamist . government, which many voters blamed for turmoil after 2011. Outside the Nidaa Tounes headquarters in the capital Tunis, . several hundred jubilant supporters took to the streets to . celebrate, waving Tunisia's red and white national flag, singing . and honking car horns. Essebi supporter Aya Khiari said: 'We succeeded in part of our struggle. 'These elections were just one round, but the . battle to build Tunisia just started.' Marzouki made no immediate statement, but his campaign's . official Facebook page said he had congratulated Essebsi on his victory. Just after results were announced, protesters set fire to a . Nidaa Tounes party office in Tataouine in southern Tunisia. Rioting also broke out in another southern town, Hamma, with . police firing teargas to disperse hundreds of youths who burned . tyres to demonstrate against the return of Ben Ali's old guard. Critics of Essebsi, an 88-year-old former parliamentary . speaker under Ben Ali, see his return as a setback for the 2011 . uprising that ousted the veteran ruler and put the North African . country on the road to full democracy, with a new constitution . and free parliamentary and presidential elections. The Tunisian uprising also inspired the Arab Spring revolts . across North Africa and the Middle East. U.S. President Barack Obama and U.S. Secretary of State John . Kerry are said to have congratulated Essebsi on his victory and Tunisia on its . conclusion of the first presidential election under the new . constitution. Just after results were announced, protesters set fire to aNidaa Tounes party office in Tataouine in southern Tunisia; rioting also broke out in another southern town, Hamma, withpolice firing teargas to disperse hundreds of youths who burned tyres to demonstrate against the return of Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali's old guard . Kerry said: 'Tunisia has provided a shining example to the region and . the world of what can be achieved through dedication to . democracy, consensus, and an inclusive political process.' Compromise has been important in Tunisian politics. Essebsi's Nidaa Tounes reached a deal with the Islamist Ennahda . party to overcome a political crisis triggered by the murder of . two secular leaders last year. As frontrunner, Essebsi dismissed critics who said victory . for him would mark a return of the old guard. He distanced . himself from the corruption and abuses of Ben Ali's era, and . argued that he was the technocrat Tunisia needed following three . messy years of an Islamist-led coalition government. Marzouki, who had sought refuge in France during the Ben . Ali era, painted a potential Essebsi presidency as a reverse for . the 'Jasmine Revolution' that forced the former autocrat to flee . into exile. But many tied Marzouki to the Ennahda government. Accepting former regime officials - known as the 'Remnants' by their critics - back into politics had been one of the . compromises that helped restore calm and keep Tunisia's often . unsteady transition to democracy on track. Victory for Essebsi consolidates his secular Nidaa Tounes . party's position after it won the most seats in October's . parliamentary election, beating out Islamist party Ennahda. Essebsi's party will now have to decide on a prime minister . and form a new government in coalition with smaller parties in . the parliament before tackling Tunisia's low-level Islamist . militancy and politically sensitive economic reforms. Ennahda holds the second largest number of seats in congress . and it and leftist Popular Front movement are still strong . movements that will prove tough opponents in negotiations over . policy in parliament.

"Well, it’s not often that a humble country road sign gets mentioned on the floor of the House of Commons. But one particular example has been drawn to the attention of no less grand a figure than the Rt Hon William Hague MP. On the face of it, the story reported in the Mail the other day about a Somerset road sign, which, thanks to mad council bureaucracy, has remained hidden in the undergrowth alongside the A38 for two years, looked as though it could be a candidate for Red Tape Lunacy of the Year. As the sign’s owner, Somerset County Council, limply explained, it couldn’t send anyone out to restore the sign to its proper position because the council would first have had to consult nearly two dozen ‘statutory consultees’ for permission to do so. When tackled on the issue by a Somerset MP, Mr Hague, the Leader of the House of Commons, agreed this was plain daft. He told Tessa Munt (Lib Dem MP for Wells), the council’s attitude did seem ‘fairly barmy’. A Somerset road sign has remained hidden in the undergrowth alongside the A38 for two years thanks to mad council bureaucracy . But the more one looks into this sorry story, it seems Mr Hague didn’t appreciate the half of it. The fact is that the word ‘barmy’ doesn’t begin to do justice to the idiocy of what has been going on in the county in which I happen to live — and which, undoubtedly, is also happening all over Britain. For a start, the sign — if one could see it where it lies, hidden in the bushes — is one of some importance. It was originally put up to warn traffic of a potentially dangerous turning from a minor side road into the busy main A38 between Bristol and Taunton. There had been several serious accidents along this stretch of road, and the purpose of erecting the sign was to alert drivers to the turn-off to two small villages and make sure they watched out for vehicles emerging from the side road into the flow of traffic. When the sign fell off its metal posts two years ago, it should have been a very simple matter to put it back in place. As Ms Munt observed after being told of the problem by locals and visiting the site herself: ‘All it needed was for someone to hoick the sign out of the undergrowth where it had fallen off its posts and use four clips to pin it back up.’ But, inevitably, in a country increasingly dragged down by jobsworths and bureaucracy, such common sense was not taken into consideration by the dead hand of officialdom. The council’s response was that it couldn’t dream of carrying out such a simple task until it had been given the go-ahead by a long list of ‘consultees’ — the various public and private bodies deemed by law to have a potential interest in the matter. It claims it has to do this under a combination of — you’ve guessed it — ‘health and safety’ legislation, and rules laid down in the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991. But when the council sent Ms Munt a full list of the ‘consultees’, she could scarcely believe her eyes. They included a whole range of major utilities, from Bristol Water and Wessex Water to SSE Power (based 100 miles away in Basingstoke). House of Commons leader William Hague (left) called the situation 'barmy' after Tessa Munt, Liberal Democrat MP for Wells, raised the issue in the House of Commons . There were two separate departments of National Grid: one for electricity, the other for gas. Also included on the list were BT Openreach, Vodafone and Orange; two separate departments of Network Rail; Tata Communications, based in Watford; and Virgin Media, based in Birmingham. What on earth was going on here? Of course, one can understand the need to consult such bodies whenever it is necessary to dig a hole that might interfere with their pipes or wires. Indeed, that is precisely what the New Roads and Street Works Act covers — with respect to works requiring the digging of holes more than ‘77 mm’ deep. But what, for heaven’s sake, could the lifting of a roadside sign out of a Somerset hedgerow have to do with the organisation in charge of our national railway network — let alone mighty international corporations based as far away as Birmingham and Watford? It seems that the council’s ‘Street Works Department’ took upon itself the task of drawing up its own list of organisations that it thought were necessary to consult. It then lamely conceded that it did not actually have to consult every single one of those 22 organisations before putting up that road sign again. ‘On average,’ it said, ‘we only have to consult 12 or 14.’ Even so, the hassle involved in contacting all 22 firms was enough for Somerset County Council officials to put the case of the ‘Incredible Vanishing Sign’ firmly at the back of their ‘pending tray’. In fact, as a Somerset council taxpayer — along with my neighbours — I have long known that our council’s highways department is notorious for its reluctance to keep its road signs in good order. For years, the main signpost in our little village was allowed to become so rust-covered that its lettering became illegible. In the end, my son, Alex, who lives in London, took matters into his own hands during a visit and went out with some paint and a brush to make it look good as new again. The council isn’t always so pathetically slow to act, though. A few years back, the residents of many Somerset villages were amazed to see teams of workmen plastering every conceivable roadside and lane with spanking new 30 mph speed limit signs. As a result, one village reported it now had 30 signs along just 200 yards of road. Our own village was decorated with 22 of them, including two on such a sharp zig-zag bend in the centre of the village that not even Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton could have got round it at more than 5 mph. But when I asked the council how much all this sign-mania was costing — at a time when it had raised our taxes by twice the rate of inflation — they were strangely coy. I was firmly told by the ‘portfolio holder’ of the ‘Environment and Transport Department’ that we couldn’t be allowed to know how much they were pouring into this scheme as ‘there is a degree of commercial sensitivity with regard to this information’. In other words, the council is quite happy to take our money, but refuses to tell us how it is spending it. Since then, it seems little has changed with our local county council’s casual approach to the hard-earned cash they extract from those of us who live here. In August, it was revealed that Somerset’s director of children’s services, Peter Lewis, was being paid £318,000 a year for working just a four-day week, making him the highest-paid council official in the country. He had come to work in Somerset from the North London borough of Haringey, where he had replaced the disgraced Sharon Shoesmith, who was sacked after presiding over the Baby P scandal, only to be awarded £600,000 in compensation. Last month, we learned that Mr Lewis himself has now been sacked by Somerset County Council, in advance of an Ofsted report giving his department its lowest possible rating — ‘inadequate’ — for the second year running. Much the same charge might be levelled at the feeble officials of Somerset’s highways department for their hopeless attitude to the maintenance of road signs — an incompetence that is, sadly, so typical of clipboard-carrying municipal jobsworths all over the country.","Somerset road sign has remained hidden in the undergrowth alongside A38 thanks to mad council bureaucracy .

"Dossier: Labour MP John Mann (pictured) has submitted an explosive dossier to police naming 22 politicians linked to historical child abuse . Police are investigating claims that at least five paedophile rings operating at the heart of Westminster were covered up. Labour MP John Mann has submitted an explosive dossier to police naming 22 politicians – including three serving MPs and three serving members of the House of Lords – linked to historical child abuse. Last night, he said the complexity of the criminality at the heart of the Establishment during the 1970s and 1980s had been underestimated. The latest claims come after Mr Mann revealed in the Mail last week that he was aware of five investigations dropped by Scotland Yard into alleged VIP child abuse which took place over the last three decades. Last night the Bassetlaw MP said: ‘There are at least five paedophile rings which involved MPs. Each of them involved at least one MP, some involved more, and these were groups of people who knew about the activities of one another. ‘In some cases I believe they committed abuse together.’ He told the Daily Telegraph: ‘Three of these figures were highly influential.’ The document submitted to police by Mr Mann also includes the names of 13 ex-ministers, including at least two who are claimed to have gone to ‘abuse parties’ held at Dolphin Square, the luxury riverside estate in Pimlico which has been home to dozens of MPs. Mr Mann acted after receiving hundreds of reports from the public. Last month the Mail revealed how in 1989 as a young councillor in Lambeth, South London, Mr Mann uncovered evidence that a Tory Cabinet minister was allegedly involved. He alerted police but was told three months later that the inquiry was being shelved on the orders of ‘those at the top’. Now Mr Mann has compiled ‘credible’ information about 22 high-profile figures alleged to have committed offences between 1970 and the late-1990s. Scroll down for video . Estate: The document submitted to police by Mr Mann also includes the names of 13 ex-ministers, including at least two who are claimed to have gone to 'abuse parties' held at Dolphin Square, Pimlico . Probe: Met Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse (pictured) has confirmed he is now assessing Mr Mann’s dossier as part of a raft of allegations that police acted inappropriately in relation to child abuse investigations covering a period from the mid-1970s up to 2005 . The report names 14 Tory politicians, five Labour and three others. Mr Mann told the Daily Mail: ‘All of these allegations are historic but some of these people are still in positions of power, having been local councillors or MPs at the time. The offences span almost 30 years. ‘But I am still getting more information coming into me. There may be more.’ He added: ‘All those 22 names are worthy of investigation by the police. The evidence against half of them is very compelling. Missing: Last month, it emerged  another dossier, which named MP Cyril Smith (pictured) as being involved in abuse, had vanished . ‘Some of them could definitely be prosecuted and I believe several of them were definitely child abusers.’ He told the Sunday Times: ‘Some of these victims have been ignored for years by the police and the Met really needs to step up to the mark now and do a proper job.’ Mr Mann also said he had received allegations that an organised crime gang and a celebrity were involved in the trafficking of young boys to abusers at Dolphin Square. But many of the reports were never investigated at the time. Met Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse has confirmed he is now assessing Mr Mann’s dossier as part of a raft of allegations that police acted inappropriately in relation to child abuse investigations covering a period from the mid-1970s up to 2005. Scotland Yard last week made a dramatic appeal for witnesses to three alleged child murders carried out by the Westminster paedophile ring, describing claims that a Conservative MP strangled a boy of 12 as ‘credible and true’. An expert panel set up in July to look into historical child abuse is poised to be scrapped after being beset by problems, including the resignation of two chairmen. Home Secretary Teresa May has told its eight members that a new body will be established with more powers. Sharon Evans, who runs a children’s charity and is on the panel, said: ‘Halting the inquiry would send a very negative message to so many people who we have promised they can have confidence in us to do the right thing.’ Last month, it emerged that another dossier compiled by MP Geoffrey Dickens had vanished after being sent in 1983 to the then home secretary Leon Brittan. It named MP Cyril Smith and other suspected establishment figures as involved in child sex abuse.","MP John Mann has given explosive dossier on alleged abuse to police .

"An Argentinian town has become the first in the country to ban beauty contests calling them sexist and discriminatory. The pageants are popular in the South American country and often lead to winners gaining greater fame and fortune. But in the city of Chivilcoy, in the province of Buenos Aires, have said they will no longer crown a queen based on her physical appearance. Making a stand: Beauty pageants are popular in the South America but one city has decided they won't hold the competition anymore . Damaging: The city of Chivilcoy say the beauty pageants they have previously held 'reinforce the idea that women must be valued and rewarded exclusively by their physical appearance, based on stereotypes' They say the practice is damaging to women as it forces them to live up to a 'stereotypical' ideal of beauty which can lead to them developing eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia. The ruling has caused heated debate in the country where beauty pageants are a common element in regional festivals where a 'queen' is chosen to represent the town for a year. Women who participate are usually between 15 and 25-years-old and are judged on categories such as 'beauty', 'personality', and 'poise' after parading in a number of outfits including swimsuits. The new legislation was put forward by the Gender Secretariat and the Assembly for Children's Rights of the local branch of the Argentine Workers' Union (CTA). The new legislation was put forward by the Gender Secretariat and the Assembly for Children's Rights of the local branch of the Argentine Workers' Union (CTA) Success: Members of the group who lobbied for beauty contests to be banned . In the past: From now on, young people in Chivilcoy will be rewarded for their efforts in the community rather than for their looks . It was supported by the mayor of Chivilcoy and several NGOs, and passed by the local council by 12 votes and five abstentions out of the 17 councillors present during the debate. Outlining the reasons for its decision they said that such contests 'reinforce the idea that women must be valued and rewarded exclusively by their physical appearance, based on stereotypes'. They added that they are 'a discriminatory and sexist practice', and an 'act of symbolic and institutional violence against women and children.' Banned: Miss World was crowned earlier this month but one city in Argentina has decided they won't hold a similar beauty pageant from now on . 'Sexist practice': The Chivilcoy council warned that rewarding women for beauty over achievements can lead to eating disorder . Instead, the beauty pageant traditionally carried out as part of the celebrations for the anniversary of the foundation of the city will be replaced by an event celebrating the achievements of young people and the difference they have made to the community. They stated that the new contest would be for 'people between 15 and 30 years who, in an individual or collective way, have stood out in volunteering activities aimed at improving the quality of life in neighbourhoods within the city or the district.' Claudia Marengo of the local CTA branch said of the decision to ban beauty pageants: 'It's a very important achievement. It has an enormous symbolic value. The municipal state made the decision, within the framework of this bill, to stop subjecting the women of Chivilcoy to the exhibition, objectification, and selection that beauty pageants imply, with the added bonus that instead they will promote other values that aim to encourage the construction of citizenship with a gender equality.' Last September, the French government banned beauty contests for children under the age of 16 on grounds that participants are subjected to hyper-sexualisation. More than just a pretty face: This year's Miss World winner, Rolene Strauss, 22, from South Africa, is a bilingual medical student . In a similar move, Russian MPs proposed a ban on child beauty pageants as they harm children physically, psychologically and intellectually. More recently the organisers of the most famous beauty pageant of all - Miss World - announced they will no longer have a swimsuit round in the competition. In an interview with Elle, chairwoman Julia Morley explained: 'I really... don't need to see women just walking up and down in bikinis. It doesn't do anything for the woman. And it doesn't do anything for any of us.' She added: 'I don't care if someone has a bottom two inches bigger than someone else's. We are really not looking at her bottom. We are really listening to her speak.' The motto of the competition - which started in the Fifties - is 'beauty with a purpose'. They encourage participants to support and get involved in charity projects and prove they have brains as well as beauty. 'Beauty with purpose': Rolene said she wants to use her position to promote education . Modernising: Miss World has announced they are now dropping their swimsuit round which as been part of the pageant for decades . This was illustrated by their year's winner, Rolene Strauss from South Africa, who was crowned Miss World earlier this month. The 22-year-old is a bilingual medical student who wants to use her position to promote the importance of a good education. She said: 'I am what I am today because of the opportunities I have received and I would love to give others the same opportunities; educating, the opportunity to be educated, to make healthy choices and also to live their dreams. 'As Miss World, people look up to you and see you as an independent, strong woman. That's the picture I'd like to show people out there.'","City of Chivilcoy, Buenos Aires, will no longer crown a beauty queen .

"When it’s bitterly cold outside and dark before 5pm, what could be more comforting than a mug of hot chocolate? But which one should you choose? We enlisted the help of chocolate expert Jennifer Earle, a judge at the International Chocolate Awards who also runs Chocolate Ecstasy Tours, an events company that seeks out the best chocolate experiences. Here are her verdicts . . . Montezuma’s Chilli Drinking Chocolate . £6.29 for 300g, montezuma.co.uk . Jennifer says: Chilli and chocolate go together like strawberries and cream. But while this has a generous hit of chocolate — 73 per cent — the chilli’s a little overpowering. We say: So easy to make. At 189 calories per serving, it’s ideal for a snack-sized pick-me-up. 4/5 . Hasslachers Hot Drinking Chocolate . £3.75 for 150g, Waitrose . Jennifer says: The real deal — 100 per cent quality Colombian cacao. You can drink it like an espresso or add milk and sugar. Absolutely my favourite. We say: A faff to make. You put three cocoa discs per cup into a pan and heat gently until they melt then add milk. But it’s a low 150 calories per serving. 5/5 . Cafe Direct Rich Hot Chocolate . £2 for 150g, Waitrose . Jennifer says: The rich aroma of top-quality Dominican Republic cocoa beans hits me before I’ve taken my first sip. There’s no added salt or other flavourings, a generous 40 per cent cocoa and only 162 calories per serving. But, disappointingly, the drink itself is grainy, a bit like a chocolate cup-a-soup. We say: This won a Good Housekeeping food award last year. Simply mix three heaped teaspoons with a little milk and top up with hot milk. 3/5 . Galaxy Instant Hot Chocolate . £2.60 for 370g, Sainsbury’s . Jennifer says: The label recommends using hot water rather than milk which means, at 80 calories, it’s diet-friendly. But it’s revolting — like drinking chocolate-flavoured water. It’s only got 3 per cent Galaxy chocolate, too, and is packed with additives and sweeteners. We say: Although it promises a ‘silky smooth’ drink, the cup is full of powdery lumps. 1/5 . Options Belgian Hot Chocolate Mint . £2 for 220g, Asda . Jennifer says: For a low calorie drink (38 calories per serving), it’s surprisingly satisfying. It tastes like restaurant mint chocolates — impressive as it’s only 20 per cent cocoa. You make it with water, but the added acacia gum gives it a nice creamy taste. We say: We found it had a cloying taste. 2/5 . Cadbury’s Drinking Chocolate . £1.50 for 250g, Asda . Jennifer says: I’ve loved Cadbury’s since childhood. But my taste buds are more sophisticated now, and with just 25 per cent cocoa and 165 calories per serving, the chocolate hit isn’t great here. But all those lovely memories make this nostalgia in a cup. We say: Just add three heaped teaspoons to a cup of hot milk. But it’s very sweet.2/5 . Charbonnel and Walker The Chocolate Drink . £4.99 for 300g, Waitrose . Jennifer says: The tiny flakes are made from a generous 51 per cent cocoa. No wonder it smells like a good-quality chocolate bar with the faintest hint of delicious vanilla. I love the sophisticated tin, too. For the price it’s a real bargain, and at 193 calories per serving, it’s not too fattening either. We say: It’s very hard to get the flakes to melt, but it’s worth it — the drink is delicious. 4/5 . Hans Sloane Rich Dark Drinking Chocolate . £4.99 for 270g, Tesco . Jennifer says: I love the look of the dark chocolate beads. But although the 53 per cent cocoa content sounds generous, the beads are virtually 47 per cent sugar (along with a few other additives). It needs less sugar and more chocolate. Then it might be drinkable. We say: You put three tablespoons of the chocolate beads into 200ml of hot milk and stir vigorously. The beads take a long time to dissolve and, even after 60 seconds whisking, we’re left with lumps still in the chocolate. It’s disappointingly sweet and has a far too large number of calories (344 per serving). A couple of sips are enough. 2/5 .","A steaming cup of cocoa is a surefire winner on a cold winter's night .

"If you are looking for a last-minute Christmas present, look no further than Elizabeth Island, which is now up for sale. But it will not come cheap, with the island - south-east of Melbourne in Victoria - expected to sell for between $5 million and $10 million. Elizabeth Island is a 26-hectare property in Westernport Bay and has been owned by Anne Tillig for 18 years. Scroll down for video . Elizabeth Island - south-west of Melbourne in Victoria - is up for sale through JP Dixon . It boasts a three-bedroom, two-bathroom home with a wrap-around veranda to enjoy its spectacular ocean views in any weather. The island is easily accessible by water and has its own helicopter landing pad. It is only a 10- to 20-minute boat ride from the Phillip Island town of Rhyll, which is south of Elizabeth Island, where Ms Tillig docks her vessel. Rhyll is a two-hour drive from the Victorian capital of Melbourne. But it can also be accessed from Hastings on the Mornington Peninsula - north-west of Elizabeth Island - which is a 30- to 40-minute boat ride. A flight onto the island from Melbourne would take about 30 minutes. Following the death of her husband Ivan Vit, Ms Tillig is selling up because she wants to do more travelling. 'We've had so many adventures there which I've written about in my book,' she told Daily Mail Australia. It is expected to sell for between $5 million and $10 million, and expressions of interest open in March . The island has its own jetty and is easily accessible by boat. It also has its own helipad . The property has a three-bedroom, two-bathroom cottage and has a wrap-around veranda . 'After 20 years living on the island, I want to travel a bit more and reluctantly decided to sell it. 'We first went there in 1996 and there was nothing on it and it was surrounded by water with gorgeous swans.' Ms Tillig - who is a former senior consultant strategic for business planning and worked in data management - said the island retreat was an escape from the busier city life. In fact, the island had such an impact on her that she was inspired to release a photographic book and a novel about her home. 'When I quit my job and started living there, I felt quite tired and stressed from city living, and within a matter of months I just felt amazingly on top of the world,' she said. 'I went through a process where you feel bored and lonely at first, and then you feel fully engaged with your surroundings. You fully unwind. 'You see the sea, the beautiful bird life, dolphins and seals, and other people have seen whales.' Elizabeth Island has been owned by Anne Tillig for 18 years and she now hopes to travel . Ms Tillig has used the island as inspiration for her photographic book and a novel . The island boast sea views and Ms Tillig said she had seen dolphins and seals go past her house . Elizabeth Island is off the coast of French Island and north of Phillip Island in Victoria . JP Dixon Real Estate’s Sorrento and Rye director Anastasia Howard told Daily Mail Australia said the island had potential to be expanded with only 'a very comfortable cottage' and large machinery sheds taking up space. 'It is a unique proposition. We obviously don't have many islands for sale and not one as accessible as this,' she said.

In the video Natasha is close to tears throughout the minute-long clip as she begs her boyfriend to make contact. She tells him: 'Pat, if you're listening, I love you so much. Please come home to me. 'It doesn't what's happened or if you feel embarrassed or if you think you've done something wrong. It really doesn't matter. 'You know I forgive everything anyway. I love you much and I just need you safe. 'I need your help with everything. I need you in my life, I need you to look after me. Please let me look after you now. In the video Miss Morgan pleads with her boyfriend to come home and says she will forgive him for anything . Specialist police diving teams have been searching the River Medway but found nothing on Friday . 'Please come home, please don't do anything. I love you so much.' Miss Morgan, a retail manager and dancer, said Mr Lamb, a broadcast engineer, would be unlikely to leave his two year-old nephew Harry Lamb who is currently suffering with leukaemia. She said she is worried her boyfriend has died but has made the video because there are no clues in the investigation. Police flew over a specialist sonar device from Ireland to scan the river for any signs of Mr Lamb, who lives in Greenhithe, Kent. Divers went in after an area of interest was indicated, but found nothing. Mr Lamb (left) has not been seen since December 13 and his family have put up missing persons posters .

'At the moment police are going through CCTV, but we've heard nothing for over a week. I'm so frightened he's dead. 'But the fact that nothing was found in the river is hopeful. 'At the moment we are all totally clueless as to what might have happened but I'm hoping the video may make a bit of difference, I have to do something. 'If he is alive I'm hoping the video will make him realise he will come home and everything will be OK. Mr Lamb's family are  trying to trace him and said they are pleased the river search returned nothing . Search and rescue teams were looking along the River Medway for signs Mr Lamb had fallen in the river . Friends of Mr Lamb said the negative search had given them hope and they remained positive . Kent Police searched the river on Friday and brought in a specialist search dog to look for the 28-year-old . 'If he has done something that I or his family don't know about then we just want to let him know that he can come home and he doesn't have to be embarrassed or afraid, whatever that might be.

"An anti-Islamic sign at the front of a remotely located restaurant has received a mixed reaction from Australians across the country. Eagle's Nest Bar and Grill at Longreach in Central West Queensland, some 1000km north west of Brisbane, placed the controversial sign which read 'sorry, no Muslims,' outside of its entrance. '2000 years ago Jesus Christ made headlines turning water into wine. The tradition continues...We turn money into beer (Sorry, no Muslims),' the full message on the blackboard read. Scroll down for video . Eagle's Nest Bar and Grill at Longreach, in Central West Queensland, placed the controversial sign which read 'sorry, no Muslims,' outside its entrance . The sign was first posted online by local resident Helen Day, who took to the restaurant's Facebook page to complain, writing 'Just a bit surprised to see the sign up 'Sorry No Muslims' ... what's that about?' While many took to social media to slam the business for the clearly discriminatory sign, a surprising number of reviewers showed support for the anti-Islamic sentiment. John Hawkes, the owner of the business, told the ABC that he received over 200 phone calls about the sign, which was displayed for only nine hours. 'While the great majority are in support of free speech and are of patriotic sentiment, we have fielded too many abusive and threatening calls. For this I apologise to my family,' Mr Hawkes said. 'I sincerely hope I don't end up sanitising my every thought to the robotic degree that is evident in commercial life around us.' The sign was first posted online by local resident Helen Day, who took to the restaurant's Facebook page to complain, writing: 'Just a bit surprised to see the sign up 'Sorry No Muslims' ... what's that about?' Since the original message, hundreds of people have also taken to the page to criticise the sign and urge others to boycott the business . She then added: 'I certainly won't be going into a place where my Muslim friends are not welcome!' Since the original message, hundreds of people have also taken to the page to criticise the sign and urge others to boycott the business. 'This blackboard is a disgraceful example of racism and exacerbates fears and intolerance for decent people,' one Facebook user wrote. 'Get an education in history (yours and ""theirs"") and compassion and live the life you live kindly.' However half of the reviews on the page have praised the bar for their attitude. 'We need more businesses supporting pro-Australian, non-halal, anti-Islamic sentiment. After all it's not islamophobia if they are really trying to kill us'. Daily Mail Australia has contacted the restaurant for comment. However a surprising number of reviewers showed support for the racist sentiment . However another outraged Facebook user described how his friend's attempt to question the restaurant over the racist slur ended with poor results. 'A friend rang them and asked if they had a sign out front saying ""Sorry no Muslims"". He said ""Yes, that's right"",' The post read. 'He was asked ""What's your reason for putting the sign there?"", and he said ""Just, no Muslims"". When asked again ""But what's your reason for putting the sign there?"" he hung up. 'We were present when the call was made and confirm what was said. This is clearly discrimination and will be reported to the Australian Discrimination Commission.' The business is located at Longreach in Central West Queensland, some 100km north west of Brisbane . The islamophobic sign comes after a traumatic week in Sydney in which self-proclaimed sheik, Man Haron Monis took 18 people hostage at the Lindt café in Martin place (pictured: the tribute to the sieges two victims) This commenter was then verbally abused and threatened by another man on the Facebook page for his comment. The mayor of Longreach, Joe Owens, called the sign 'an unfortunate thing,' telling the ABC that the town was one that welcomes 'all races and religions'. The islamophobic sign comes after a traumatic week in Sydney in which self-proclaimed sheik, Man Haron Monis took 18 people hostage at the Lindt café in Martin place, resulting in the death of two innocent people. While the restaurant's sign stands as an example of the hateful sentiment that the event evoked in some Australians, many others have sent messages of solidarity by offering to accompany Muslims on public transport with the hashtag #IllRideWithYou, in an attempt dispel fears of anti-Islamic attacks.","The sign was displayed by Eagle's Nest Bar and Grill at Longreach, in Central West Queensland, some 100km north west of Brisbane .

"A dramatic rise in the number of street lights being switched off to save money has sparked fears of an increase in crime and road accidents. Three-quarters of councils are dimming or extinguishing lights, a survey reveals. The number of lamps being turned off or set to shine less brightly has risen to 1.36million, compared with just 148,000 in May 2010 when the Coalition came to power. The rise has come as councils seek to cut costs and reduce carbon emissions. The Government has said it is right for street lights to be turned off where safe and practical. But critics warn darker streets leave many residents frightened to go out and increase the chances of crime and car crashes. Scroll down for video . Three-quarters of councils are dimming or extinguishing lights, a survey by the Labour Party of 141 councils in England responsible for a total of 5.7million street lights, revealed . Critics warn darker streets leave many residents frightened to go out and increase the chances of crime . The AA and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents have called for crime rates and accident figures to be examined in the areas where lights are dimmed or switched off. The survey, by the Labour Party, covered 141 councils in England responsible for a total of 5.7million street lights. It found that 558,000 are now being switched off at night, eight times as many as in May 2010. A further 797,000 are being dimmed, ten times as many as when the Coalition came to power. Overall, the proportion of lights being switched off or dimmed has risen from 2.6 per cent in 2010 to 24 per cent. Fifty councils are switching off some of their lights and 98 are dimming some, with 42 doing both. Across all councils, 29 per cent of lights are being turned off or dimmed at night in Conservative-controlled areas, compared with 13 per cent in Labour areas. The shires are especially badly affected, with every shire county authority in England either switching off or dimming lights. According to Labour's figures, 99 per cent of lights are dimmed in Surrey, while in Essex 83 per cent are now switched off. In Dorset and Hertfordshire, more than two-thirds of lights are turned off. Labour last night put the blame on Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles. The survey revealed that 558,000 are now being switched off at night, eight times as many as in May 2010 . Hilary Benn, the party's  local government spokesman said, 'Britain has been plunged in to darkness' Hilary Benn, the party's communities and local government spokesman, said: 'Street lights ensure that people are safe on our roads and feel safe walking home, especially at this time of the year when the nights have drawn in. 'Our research shows however that significant areas of Britain have been plunged into darkness since May 2010 as a result of David Cameron and Eric Pickles' policies. Eric Pickles has even boasted that he 'loves' switching off street lights, which will do nothing to reassure people walking home in the dark. 'David Cameron and Eric Pickles need to tell their shire councils to get their act together and do what forward-thinking authorities are already doing by investing in new technologies like LED lights to save money on electricity bills and keep residents safe.' Ministers accused Labour of hypocrisy, pointing out that Mr Benn urged councils to cut street lighting when he was a minister in the last Labour government. Earlier this year Mr Pickles (pictured) was quoted in Basildon, Essex, as criticising local councillors who wanted Essex County Council to put street lights back on . The Government says councils should listen to local residents and ensure that lighting is not switched off if there are concerns about safety and crime. Earlier this year Mr Pickles was quoted in Basildon, Essex, as criticising local councillors who wanted Essex County Council to put street lights back on. 'In a time when we are on the cusp with regards to our electricity supply, we can't have lights burning all night on the off chance someone wants to get out and do aerobics at 3am,' he said, adding that turning lights off had 'decreased crime because burglars love ambient lighting'. However, a review by Cambridge criminologists in 2008 concluded that 'improved street lighting should continue to be used to prevent crime in public areas'. Other studies found an average 20 per cent decrease in crime in well-lit areas. The AA has warned that low lighting makes fatal accidents more likely at night. AA president Edmund King said: 'Roads that are safe when lit can be unsafe with the lights off. Lighting illuminates hazards and gives road users a greater chance of avoiding them.' But communities minister Brandon Lewis said: 'This is complete hypocrisy from the Labour Party, given when in government, the likes of Ed Miliband and Hilary Benn bullied and cajoled councils into cutting street lights as part of their climate change zealotry. This Government values the role of street lighting – but it should be a local decision, street by street, on what local residents actually want.'","Street lights being switched off sparks fears of rise in crime and accidents .

"Watching car chases in films such as The Italian Job make motorists more dangerous behind the wheel, a study has found. Those who watch more movies with reckless driving scenes while growing up were more likely to behave carelessly in the driver's seat, according to the research. Action films including The Fast and Furious and The Italian Job had a negative effect on young people, regardless of their background or character. Scroll down for video . People who watch more movies with dangerous driving scenes are likely to behave recklessly, a study has found. Pictured, a scene from the original 1969 The Italian Job, starring Michael Caine . Behavioural scientists asked almost 2,000 young people in the U.S. about the movies they watched when they were aged between 10 and 14 in 2003. They then re-interviewed them a further five times over subsequent years and, during the final interview, they were probed about their driving behaviour. Questions included whether they weaved in and out of traffic, were tailgaters and how much they sped. Evelien Kostermans, lead researcher from Radboud University Nijmegen in the Netherlands, said: ‘Adolescents were more likely to drive recklessly the higher the proportion of movies they had seen that showed reckless driving behaviours. Steve McQueen stars in 1968 movie Bullitt, which is notable for its car chase scene through San Francisco and has since been hailed as one of the greatest car chases in movie history . A car chase scene from The Fast and The Furious 6. Scientists found action films like The Fast and Furious and The Italian Job had a negative effect on young people, regardless of their background or character . ‘This effect was independent of many other influencing factors, such as socio-economic status, parental influence, or a sensation-seeking personality.’ She added: ‘Perhaps ratings and censor boards should consider reckless driving as part of the ratings criteria.’ Writing in the journal PLoS ONE, the researchers said their study was the first to ‘show a direct long-term relation between passive exposure to reckless driving content in movies and reckless driving among adolescents’. Repeated exposure to ‘risk-glorifying media’ may promote risk-taking by creating positive associations with such behaviour, they said. Dr Kostermans added: ‘They internalise the idea that it is okay to drive like that, that it is a normal thing to do because they see it all the time in those movies. ‘Parents should understand that adolescents model behaviours they see in movies and should restrict children and adolescents in the number and types of movies they are allowed to watch each week.'

"Justin Welby said he treated the tragedy, in which his seven-month old daughter was killed, as a 'constant reminder of the uncertainty of life’ The Archbishop of Canterbury revealed yesterday his heartbreak at the loss of his baby daughter in a car crash 31 years ago. Justin Welby said he treated the tragedy France in 1983, in which his seven-month old daughter was killed, as a 'constant reminder of the uncertainty of life’. In an emotional interview on Desert Island Discs, he also recalled meeting a tearful Sir Winston Churchill for lunch. The Archbishop told Radio 4 presenter Kirsty Young that he and his wife Caroline, who have five other children, mark each anniversary of Johanna's death. ‘The thing is to celebrate the person, to remember them with love, to remember what they gave and what you gave them,' he said. ‘In other words, attack the day so it does not attack you.' Remembering happy childhood summers spent with his mother Jane Gillian in Norfolk, the Archbishop described meeting with Sir Winston Churchill. Once she took him for tea with the former Prime Minister when he was very young as she had been his private secretary. ‘I remember a very, very old man,’ he said. ‘And he cried, I don’t know why. And because he cried, I cried. And then we sat and had tea. I’ve talked to her about it and she said “Well, he cried quite a lot”.’ These stays with his mother contrasted to ‘rather more complicated times’ in London with his father, who died of a heart attack in 1977. The Archbishop  revealed how he suffered a ‘grim’ childhood Christmas with his alcoholic father who stayed in bed all day. He went out and wandered the streets after being left to cope alone by his father Gavin, but everything was shut and he returned to the house to try to find something to eat. The Archbishop also told how his childhood ‘felt very painful at times’ after his parents divorced when he was only three. He realised when he was about 12 that his businessman father, who he described as ‘very full of rage and anger’, had a drink problem. In a candid and emotional interview on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs with presenter Kirsty Young (right), the Archbishop (left) revealed his heartbreak at the loss of his baby daughter in a car crash 31 years ago . Recalling his miserable Christmas, he said: ‘I think I went out once or twice but, you know, everything was closed. I didn’t know really what to do with myself. ‘I suspect I watched telly a bit and sort of scrounged around the fridge for something to eat. ‘A sandwich? I can’t remember. But it was a grim day. That was a grim, grim day.’ He admitted suffering from ‘imposter syndrome’ in which he was assailed by worries about his ability for the demanding role of leading the Church of England. There were also moments of frustration about tensions within the Anglican church over issues such as same-sex marriage. On a lighter note, however, he told how he found doing the ironing was a good time for contemplation and prayer. And, while his family plays the ‘noisy’ card game Racing Demon, he sings the 1961 hit The Lion Sleeps Tonight by The Tokens. The Archbishop (right, aged 18) realised when he was about 12 that his businessman father (left), who he described as ‘very full of rage and anger’, had a drink problem . It was included in the Archbishop’s song selections along with another of his favourites, You’ll Never Walk Alone by Gerry and the Pacemakers. This was a tribute to Liverpool, where he was Dean for nearly four years. He added: ‘I remember being at Anfield [stadium] on the anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster and this being sung, and going back to the cathedral and finding Everton and Liverpool scarves all over and this amazing, wonderful, poor, battered, thrusting, lively, humorous city coming together.’ The Archbishop also chose a Sudanese religious song after having recently returned from a visit there because of ‘that sense of their faith and trust in and joy – God in the midst of absolute horror’. With the Bible given to all castaways, the Archbishop selected Gibbon’s historical tome The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire as his book. His luxury item was the complete box set of the US political drama West Wing.","Archbishop of Canterbury reveals heartbreak at loss of his baby daughter .

Scroll down for video .

Posing in a stunning full-length blue gown while holding a beautiful baby John outside the stately home, Lady Weymouth told Hello! she had been diagnosed with a bleed on the brain. She was also suffering from a disorder with her pituitary gland which left her crippled in pain and meant the baby was delivered by Caesarean section three weeks early. Lady Weymouth, who is the UK's first black aristocrat, said: 'It was terrifying. I'd never been ill before and I was 36 weeks pregnant.' The high-society star, who is still undergoing tests as doctors try to find out what happened, said giving birth had changed her life forever. The Viscount is the heir to the Longleat estate, which is visited by thousands each year . Lady Weymouth poses at her 900-acre Longleat estate . She said: 'I'm different to how I used to be but then I think having a baby changes everyone. I'm worrying a lot and thinking about the stuff that's not even happening, the what ifs. 'And I can't run around like I used to - I overestimate my energy and then crash and I'm emotional, so emotional. But I just have to get over it and get a grip.' Lady Weymouth said the birth was 'incredible' - and the arrival of baby John had made her marriage stronger than ever. 'Ceawlin held him first and then put him on my chest,' she said. 'I was just like, ""Wow"". You forget everything, nothing else matters once you have a baby. The interview with Viscountess Weymouth appears in Hello! magazine, out now . 'It's made our relationship stronger because we've had something serious to cope with and we both love the baby so much, this person we've made. It's extraordinary how nature works. Mind-blowing.' John, she says, has brought new life to Longleat. 'It feels like a renaissance,' she said. 'It's always been vibrant here - there's always been something exciting going on - but it's a new generation, a new dynamic. It's a very exciting time.' This happy news for the Viscount and Viscountess comes after years of unease for their family. The couple married in June 2013 but the wedding was marred by the fact that the Viscount's parents - the Lord and Lady Bath - did not attend. At the time they were not on speaking terms with the couple. It is thought that the family fall out had come about due to the removal of some ancient murals which had adorned the walls of the famous Longleat estate in Wiltshire. Lady Weymouth said at the time: 'It’s very sad he didn’t come to the wedding and that the misunderstanding has escalated to this point, but what can I do?’ However the family are now on good terms and will no doubt be looking forward to spending their first Christmas with little John.

It'll be beach weather in Perth but it'll be best if you stay at home in Sydney.

"A single mother has cancelled Christmas for her 11-year-old son so she can scrape together the £20,000 needed to pay his private school fees.

Kelly Bradford, 41, (right) has cancelled Christmas for her 11-year-old son William (left) so she can scrape together the £20,000 needed to pay his private school fees . 'People might call me a Scrooge but I’m not. I would love to have a table groaning with treats and piles of presents for William,' she told The Sunday Mirror's Gemma Aldridge. 'But the fact is that my son’s ­education is more important to me than his happiness on one day of the year, so I’d rather cancel Christmas because I know he’ll thank me later.' William had been offered a place at a state school near their home, but despite its 'good' Ofsted rating, Miss Bradford decided early on that she would send her son to private school. Having left school herself at 16 with no qualifications, Miss Bradford says she is determined to give her son the advantages she never had - even if that means forgoing Christmas excesses, such as trips to a pantomime and stockings full of presents, to pay for it. William, pictured with the family dog Matilda, says he is 'sad' he won't get any presents, but is happy his mother works so hard to send him to a good school . Miss Bradford, pictured with her son in 2010, says she is determined to give her son the advantages she never had - even if that means forgoing Christmas excesses to pay for it . Miss Bradford separated from William's father six years ago, and though he supports her decision to send her son to a fee-paying school, Ms Bradford says she pays for the boy's education, which includes lessons in Sanskrit and Latin. Before the split, Miss Bradford said she and her ex had given William a perfect Christmas, but she found that come New Year's Day much of the money she had spent on food and toys had seemed wasted. So this year she decided to strip back the celebrations and instead put the family resources into giving William the gift of education after saving all year to pay the bill, due in January. Self-employed writer and broadcaster Miss Bradford has previously told the Daily Mail that she is 'motivated by a desire to do what I believe is best for my child'. She says she works 'all hours' to put her son through school, and if he moans, she reminds him just how lucky he is to be receiving a private education. William said:'I feel sad I won’t get many presents. I’m happy mum works so hard to send me to a good school, but if money was no issue I’d want an Oculus Rift virtual 3D headset for playing computer games.'","Kelly Bradford, 41, would rather spend money on son William's education .

"A former trader at Royal Bank of Scotland has become the first UK banker to be arrested on suspicion of rigging the £3.5trillion a day foreign exchange market. City of London police and the Serious Fraud Office arrested the unnamed man at an address in Billericay in Essex on Friday morning. The SFO refused to give any more details, confirming only that an individual had been arrested in connection with one of its investigations. But sources confirmed that the individual worked at RBS and was involved in the trading of foreign current rates. A former trader at Royal Bank of Scotland has become the first UK banker to be arrested on suspicion of rigging the £3.5trillion a day foreign exchange market . Six banks, including RBS and HSBC, were fined a total of £2.6billion by UK and US regulators last month for their part in the racket. Bankers, who called themselves the 'A-Team', ‘Three Musketeers’ and ‘The Players’ colluded online by sharing confidential information about clients’ currency orders to boost their bonuses. Experts believe this is just the first of dozens of arrests, with many traders facing jail for a scandal widely believed to be even bigger than the recent ‘Libor’ interest rate-rigging scam. The Serious Fraud Office launched a criminal investigation into the sprawling ‘Forex’ market in July but until now has made no arrests, despite around 30 bank staff sacked or suspended. David Buik, a veteran financial commentator from broker Panmure Gordon, described the foreign exchange scandal as the ‘saddest episode in my 52 years working in the City.’ He said: ‘I’d be amazed if there were not many more arrests. 'The foreign exchange market is the biggest in the world so could make any wrongdoing related to Libor rates seem like a Vicarage tea party by comparison. Those found guilty of fraud should be sent to jail.’ Sources confirmed that the individual worked at RBS and was involved in the trading of foreign current rates . The development emerges as RBS is this week expected to give an update on its internal investigation into the Forex market, and the punishment meted out to rogue employees. It suspects that 50 former and current staff may have been involved - compared to just 21 involved in the Libor interest rate rigging conspiracy which also led to huge fines for banks, including RBS. It will be expected to demonstate it has taken a hard-line, piling the pressure on the SFO to make further arrests. When it was fined almost £400million last month, the state backed lender admitted that just six staff had been disciplined, including three suspended. John Mann, a Labour member of the Treasury Select Committee said: ‘I’d expect to see more arrests. Those involved should be held to account. But I would also expect those arrested to reveal the senior managers who turned a blind eye.’ Some are likely to be current or former employees of Barclays. The high street giant faces a fine of more than £500million for manipulating foreign exchange markets, despite refusing to settle with regulators in October. Its chief executive Antony Jenkins last week admitted that the £500million it had set aside to cover its bills would probably not be enough. Pressure is growing on the Government and authorities to claim the scalp of a high profile banker. More than seven years since the run on Northern Rock, not a single senior banker has been jailed for their role in the financial crisis. So far the Serious Fraud Office has arrested 13 employees for manipulating Libor interest rates used to set the cost of mortgages. Just one has been charged after pleading guilty in October to conspiracy to defraud. The names of the individual and those 12 others arrested have been protected by a court order.

"An international jewellery scam dubbed the 'Italian Job' has been broken up by police who stormed a luxury hotel and arrested a gang of alleged fraudsters. Detectives believe that the men, who claim to be from Italy but are actually Eastern European, were hoping to defraud jewellery shops in the North-West of England by using fake money to buy goods. They seized £2million worth of counterfeit euro notes, as well as £50,000 in genuine currency and a haul of watches worth around £100,000. Haul: This fake money was seized by police investigating an alleged jewellery fraud gang on Saturday . Four alleged fraudsters had hired a whole conference room, according to the police who apprehended them at Manchester's Portland Thistle Hotel. They were dressed in expensive Italian suits and claimed to be from Italy themselves, while they drove an Audi 8 and Alfa Romeo with German number plates. Police arrested two of the suspects in the foyer of the hotel in front of guests and shoppers on Saturday afternoon, and the other two were arrested in the conference room. Det Insp Rob Cousen of Greater Manchester Police said: 'We were responding to dynamic intelligence. We had only established an hour earlier they were in the Portland. 'We had previously received intelligence that a Manchester jeweller had been targeted by a gang. Those arrested have given details of who they claim to be but they had a number of ID cards. 'We believe they are probably from Eastern Europe and linked to an international organised crime gang. Arrest: The four men were apprehended at the Portland Thistle Hotel in central Manchester . 'They were very sharply dressed, flash, and wore a lot jewellery. We are trying to establish if the jewellery they had was real or fake. They claimed to be Italian - a proper Italian job. 'They had hired the Denis Law conference suite, which gives an indication of their suspected plans. You don't go to that much trouble for a small fraud. 'We believe we have stopped a number of jewellery businesses from going out of business. They could have been ruined by this kind of fraud, and lost everything, their livelihoods, even their homes.' The police had received a tip-off from Safer Gems, an organisation which monitors allegations of crime in the jewellery, fine arts and antiques trades. It is believed that the men were hoping to bring jewellers to their hotel suite and buy gems using a mixture of real and fake cash. Police claim that the gang entered Britain via the Channel Tunnel before travelling north of Manchester.

"A terror alert was sparked at Strangeways jail after prisoners built a DIY bomb from an empty orange juice bottle and caused a 'petrifying' explosion. The Manchester prison was put into lockdown after inmates let off the device - made from everyday household products - and ran out of the cell in D-wing, which holds long-term prisoners. The offenders allegedly boasted they made the bomb from a plastic bottle purchased in the canteen to show how easy it was, but reportedly had no idea how big the explosion would be. Prisoners at Strangeways jail in Manchester sparked a terror alert after causing an explosion with a DIY bomb . A former inmate who witnessed it told The Sun: 'It's terrifying. One of the prisoners was boasting about how easy it was — and showed people how to do it. He was using everyday items you can get in a prison really easily. 'The boom shook the whole wing. The lads who did it were petrified — they didn't realise how big the explosion would be.' They told the paper that the culprits, who included drug dealers and a rapist, lit the homemade bomb before running out of the cell. Terrorism police were then called in. Eight inmates at HMP Manchester, formerly known as Strangeways, have reportedly been accused of endangering staff and other inmates. A former inmate said the bomb was made from a plastic orange juice bottle and other household products . However, a prison service spokesperson confirmed that the incident, which happened earlier year, was not part of an Islamist plot. They said: 'On 15 July, an incident led to a very small amount of damage being caused to a cell. There were no injuries caused to staff or prisoners during this incident. 'We take incidents of this nature extremely seriously. The police were informed immediately and an internal investigation was carried out.' HMP Manchester is home to some of Britain's most notorious criminals including one-eyed police murderer Dale Cregan, who is serving a life sentence.","Manchester prison put in lockdown after inmates let off homemade device .

"The man who shot two NYPD cops dead on Saturday had threatened to take his own life that morning before his ex-girlfriend talked him out of it - and he turned the gun on her instead. Early on Saturday morning, before murdering officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu in Brooklyn, Ismaaiyl Brinsley turned up unannounced at his ex-girlfriend's home in Owings Mills, Maryland and pointed a gun to his head, according to Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce. His ex, Air Force reservist Shaneka Thompson, managed to talk him out of taking his life - before he turned the gun on her instead. 'The young lady he shot, a very courageous young woman,' Boyce siad. 'He put the gun to his own head when he broke into her apartment, and then she talked him out of that, and he later shot her before he left. She said she'd never seen him with a gun before.' Victim: Shaneka Thompson, pictured, managed to talk her ex-boyfriend Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, out of shooting himself on Saturday. But he shot her instead and went on to kill two police officers in Brooklyn . He fired a single shot at her stomach around 5.50am before fleeing with her cell phone, which he later used to call her mother to apologize, cops said. A neighbor, Yevette Seay, 41, said she was woken by Thompson's screams on Saturday. 'I could hear something going on and it wasn't pleasant,' Seay said. 'Then I heard some screaming, then she went out onto her balcony and screamed for help.' Gunman: Brinsley killed himself after he was chased into the subway by cops following the murders . According to Seay, Thompson shouted: '""He shot me, I don't want to die, I don't want to die.""' Thompson ran to Seay's apartment and banged on her door, and Seay said she could see the bloodied 29-year-old woman through the peep hole. Thompson wanted her to open her door, but she didn't know what was going on, so she kept it closed and called 911, she said, adding there was blood all over the carpet in the hallway. 'I told her to hang in there. I was afraid to ask her too many questions because she was hysterical,' Seay said. Her sister said she saw the gunman running through the parking lot. After seeing news reports about the New York shooting and the suspect's photo, Seay's sister figured out it that she had seen Brinsley running. 'We were right there in the middle of that, and to know what he did afterwards was even more disturbing,' Seay said. Within minutes, help arrived and Thompson was rushed to a University of Maryland Medical Center and is expected to survive. She was interviewed by investigators in hospital on Sunday night. She told officers that she had been romantically involved with Brinsley and that he somehow got inside the lobby of her building before knocking on her door. He did not have a key. Thompson told investigators that Brinsley didn't say anything about harming police officers and or mention police in any way, police said. Scene: Early on Saturday morning, he turned up at Thompson's apartment complex (pictured) unannounced before holding a gun to his head. He then shot her once in the stomach and she ran to a neighbor for help . Final image: He then jumped on a bus to New York City, where he was captured on surveillance footage in a mall near the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Afterwards, he shot dead the two officers in their car . He shot her following a dispute about their relationship status, Baltimore County police said. Thompson's grandfather, James Delly, said from his home in Blythewood, South Carolina, on Monday morning that he had been in touch by phone with Thompson's mother and that Thompson was doing OK. He said he didn't know Brinsley and that Thompson had never mentioned him. 'She's my granddaughter. She's a hard-working girl, and I love her,' Delly said. Thompson is an Air Force reservist, stationed at Pope Field at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where she works in medical administration and carries the rank of staff sergeant, said Major Lisa Ray, a spokeswoman for the 440th Airlift Wing. She told police that she had never seen her ex with a gun before. The weapon he used to shoot her and the two officers was bought in Jonesboro, Georgia in 1996, according to the New York Daily News. It is unclear how Brinsley, who had a long rap sheet, got the weapon. NYPD officers: The gunman  fired a fatal round of bullets at Wenjian Liu (left) and Rafael Ramos (right) Murder site: Forensic officers work to find evidence at the car where the two officers were killed . After his attack on Thompson, he rode a Bolt bus to New York - as police started tracking Thompson's cellphone in a bid to follow him. After arriving in New York City, he took the subway to Atlantic Avenue-Barclays Center in Brooklyn, where he dumped his ex-girlfriend's stolen cell phone. Around this time, Baltimore County Police sent the NYPD a fax alerting them to Brinsley and his intentions - but it did not reach cops on the streets in time. Brinsley identified his targets at Tompkins Avenue in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, then instructed passersby to watch before firing four shots at the two police officers in their car. He then ran into the subway station but a waiting train closed its doors. With police making chase, he then shot himself dead. On Monday, police released an image of Brinsley caught on surveillance footage walking though a mall next to the Barclays Center before he murdered the two cops. Deadly weapon: Police issued this image of the gun Brinsley used both against his girlfriend and to murder the officers and are trying to trace its history. Thompson said she had never seen him with a gun before . Threatening post: While he was travelling to New York, Brinsley posted this threat to police on Istangram . In the footage he is carrying a bag, which police believe contains the silver Taurus handgun he used to kill officer Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu. 'What you see over here are some images, we have a tape of the Atlantic Center Mall,' Boyce said. 'We're asking the public's assistance if they see him - because right now we don't know where he was for two hours. 'He's walking round there, he has a bag in his hand, he's had that bag in his hand for most of the day. We have him with that bag over by the crime scene as well. We believe the gun was in that bag.' The Atlantic Center is about two miles from the scene of the shooting. On Monday, Brinsley's estranged family told the New York Post that his life had been 'spiraling out of control'. Estranged: On Monday, Brinsley's sister Jalaa'a Brinsley, pictured, said she had cut off ties with him when he had turned to a life of crime. She said the family had tried to get him help but he would not listen . 'We were best friends when I was a kid,' his sister Jalaa'a Brinsley said. 'But when he turned to a life of crime, I had to separate myself from him. 'We tried to give him help. We tried to ask him to get some help. [But] he’s a grown man.' Brinsley's mother, Shakuwra 'Cheryl' Dabre, apologized to the families of the victims. 'I am deeply sorry for the loss of the two innocent men who were killed, and offer my sincerest condolences to their families,' she said in a statement. 'I am also grieving the loss of my son, and ask that my privacy be respected at this time.'","Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, shot his ex-girlfriend Shaneka Thompson in Maryland before taking a bus to New York and killing two cops on Saturday .

"Helping others: Lord Freud, the health and safety minister, pictured, said people should not fear doing a ‘good deed’ for friends, family or neighbours . People should ignore ‘bogus’ health and safety warnings and help clear ice and snow from outside their neighbours’ homes, a minister said last night. Lord Freud, the health and safety minister, said people should not fear doing a ‘good deed’ for friends, family or neighbours. The Government is introducing a ‘Good Samaritan law’ to give people who intervene in good faith to help someone else in difficulty from prosecution or legal action. Similar legislation operates in Australia where it has reduced the potential for negligence claims against doctors and emergency workers, as well as ordinary members of the public. Lord Freud said people would not be sued or held responsible if someone fell and injured themselves on a path or pavement that they had cleared. ‘People need to be aware that they will not be reprimanded for doing a good deed by clearing ice and snow,’ he said. ‘The truth is very simple: you can clear ice and snow from footpaths and pavements but always be careful that you don’t put yourself in danger. ‘Countless lives have been saved and injuries prevented because of robust health and safety practices. But bogus excuses give real safety laws a bad name and stop people from taking action.’ Chair of the Health and Safety Executive Judith Hackitt said: ‘Anyone can clear ice and snow from public spaces, so don’t be put off because you’re afraid someone will get injured.

'Remember, people walking on snow and ice have a responsibility to themselves to be careful.’ An official Government ‘snow code’ advises householders to clear paths and driveways earlier in the day when snow is fresh and loose.

"Winter storms are set to bring travel chaos to almost 100 million as they attempt to make their way home for the Christmas break. More than 15 inches of snow is expected in Washington State over Christmas with heavy falls over the Rockies, Montana, Wyoming and Idaho. Further heavy snows are expected in states surrounding the Great Lakes, while heavy rains are believed to to be threatening an area surrounding the Mississippi Valley according to the National Weather Service. Snow is threatening an area from the West Coast through the Great Lakes to Maine on the East Coast . Some parts of Washington State are being threatened with up to 15 inches of snow . But meteorologist Amy Seeley said various computer models showed differing forecasts Monday and ""aren't in agreement yet."" More than 90 per cent of some 98.6 million holiday travelers are expected to get to and from home by car during the next two weeks, while about six per cent are expected to fly, according to Julie Hall, spokeswoman for the AAA motor club. AAA expects car travel to be up more than four per cent this year compared to 2013. Hall says that's at least partly due to lower gas prices. The storm could cause similar disruption as Winter Coast Storm Cato in November, when more than 400,000 people spent Thanksgiving without power as a nor'easter caused chaos across the East Coast. Snow fell in every state from Virginia to Maine as the storm hit its peak and forced the cancellation of more than 700 flights.

"A heartbroken mother who lost two sons in the Peshawar school massacre has described the horrifying moment she was forced to identify one of her boys from a minor cut he suffered on his finger. As new images emerged of the pupils just days before the attack, Laleena Ali Shah described how she recognised the body of her 'gentle' son Hassnain lying in a pool of blood outside the school thanks only to a plaster on one of his fingers. Her second son Abdullah was found dead and covered in blood nearby. 'It was very sorry state when we were searching for his body...I recognized him from his finger,' she said. 'The bodies were dumped literally in pools of blood. So recognition...was very difficult,' Mrs Ali Shah added. Last Tuesday 132 innocent children and 13 members of school staff were slaughtered when depraved Taliban gunmen stormed the school in the north west Pakistani city with assault rifles and grenades, before their 'handlers' ordered them to detonate their suicide vests. The majority of the victims, which included children as young as five, were shot at point blank range in the head or neck - with members of the Pakistani Taliban claiming responsibility for the atrocity and warning the country's army that it was 'just the trailer' for similar attacks in the future. Yesterday Pakistan said it will execute around 500 militants in the coming weeks after lifting  a moratorium on the death penalty in terror cases following last week's school massacre.

Tragic: Pictured at the school sports day barely two weeks before the tragedy, Hassnain (back row, third from left) was only identified by his mother because of a minor cut on his finger, after he asked his father if he could kill a chicken . Grief: School principal Tahira Qazi, who was killed shepherding children to safety, was pictured just days before the tragedy with Brigadier Asad and sports teacher Javed who also died in the incident . Describing the morning of the attack, Mrs Ali Shah said her son Hassnain had cut his finger when his father Afzak reluctantly allowed the young boy to kill a chicken for the family's dinner. Wearing a plaster over his wound, Hassnain and his brother Abdullah were then taken 300 yards down the road to their Army-run school in Peshawar where their mother thought they would be safe. Just hours later the two young boys and 130 of their schoolmates fell victim to the six Taliban gunmen who stormed the school with assault rifles and grenades, firing the weapons indiscriminately in act they claimed was to prevent the children becoming soldiers in the future. 'The bodies were dumped literally in pools of blood,' Mrs Ali Shah said. 'Recognition of the bodies - 90 per cent of which had been shot at point blank range in the neck and throat - was very difficult.' 'I have lost my two sons, Abdullah and Hassnain. Both were gentle boys. They always come and kissed me before they go to school. I have lost both of them,' she added, holding a third son, just 25 days old - on her lap. She does so upon the advice of her female relatives who say the presence of the newborn is the only thing that succeeds in calming Mrs Ali Shah down. Jovial scene: Heartbreaking new photographs emerged of teachers and pupils - including Hassnain (circled) - smiling in joy at an army school sports event just days before the massacre. The boys are seen making the peace sign as they pose with footballs and cricket bats . A young boy who is believed to have been killed in the Peshawar massacre is given a medal at a sports day held at the school only days before Taliban gunmen slaughtered 132 children and 13 members of staff . Horror: Young men are photographed at a school sports event just days before the Peshawar massacre . Mrs Ali Shah spoke as heartbreaking new photographs emerged of teachers and pupils - including Hassnain - smiling in joy at an army school sports event just days before the massacre. Young children were pictured being handed medals and awards, while others are seen making the peace sign as they with posing with footballs and cricket bats in jovial scenes. Just days later, Hassnain and Abdullah Ali Shah's father Afzak was unable to speak for several hours after the true horror of the school massacre sunk in. Such is the proximity of the family home to the school, that every burst of gunfire and every suicide vest explosion could be heard during the nine hour siege, but relatives were unable to offer to help as the area was sealed of by the army and security services. The horror of hearing the massacre take place and knowing your child is involved is unimaginable. Three days after the massacre the family held a feast in celebration of their sons' lives, inviting relatives and local poor people to enjoy the food in memory of Hassnain and  Abdullah. Heartbreaking: Details of the feast came as another mother, Sumaira Mahfooz, told MailOnline how she too lost a son in the massacre. Academically gifted Ahmad Mahfooz (right holding books) had progressed at an astonishing rate since joining the school, with excellent handwriting in both English and Urdu .

Shoes lie among blood on the auditorium floor, where pupils were having a First Aid lecture before the massacre unfolded . Nightmare scene: The pictures of the school's interior emerged as Pakistan began three days of mourning . Details of the feast came as another mother, Sumaira Mahfooz, told MailOnline how she too lost a son in the massacre. Academically gifted Ahmad Mahfooz had progressed at an astonishing rate since joining the school, with excellent handwriting in both English and Urdu. His skill was such that his fellow pupils would call him every evening for help with their mathematics homework, and his teachers only ever gave him excellent grades on parents' evening. On the day of his death the young boy awoke and recited the Koran as usual. When Mrs Mahfooz came to ask him to fetch milk and bread from the nearby market, Ahmad politely asked her not to interrupt him in future while he is reading the religious text. Just hours later he was dead. 'It was so tragic when I visited the Combined Military Hospital and checked the injured list. The male nurse showed me the list and I told him there was nobody there by the name of Ahmad,' Mrs Mahfooz said. 'Then he asked me whether I wanted to check the list of martyrs [those killed by the Taliban gunmen]. With a heavy heart I told him to show me the list,' she added. 'It was the hardest moment of my life. The male nurse was reading the names of the martyrs and with each name my heart was sinking. At last Ahmad's name was called,' she went on to say. In disguise: The photographs show the six heavily armed men wearing both traditional clothing of Taliban fighters and the Pakistan military uniforms they wore to avoid suspicion before storming the school . Killers: Photographs of the six men responsible for murdering 132 children were released by the Taliban along with an emailed statement revealing the terrorists plan more attacks at schools in Pakistan . Militants: All six  gunmen were shot dead by Pakistan security officials - but not until they'd killed 132 children . Warped: These two-cold blooded killers stare menacingly  into the camera before carrying out the massacre . Armed: Released by the terror group's spokesman Mohammad Khurasani a third group shot shows the same men wearing full military fatigues - an outfit that would outed them as Taliban to security guards . Ahmad Mahfooz was well-known in Peshawar, where his academic skills made him popular with other children. He too was photographed enjoying himself on the recent school sports day. Mazhar Hussain, a neighbour, told MailOnline: 'Ahmad was a very nice boy. On the day of the carnage when I went to mosque for evening prayer. The prayer leader was crying and he told me that Ahmad was killed in the school carnage.' 'He was very attached with neighbours and relatives. All of them liked him a lot. He was a regular visitor of the local mosque and came to every prayer. He used to come 15 minutes earlier to pray,' she added. Following his tragic death, Ahmad's mother vowed never to send another child to school. 'I found myself in my home, lying on the bed when everyone was crying... I lost my brilliant son. I will never let my other children to go for education to schools. For me now, life is more important then education,' Mrs Mahfooz said.","Laleena Ali Shah found two sons dead in pools of blood at the school .

"A Belgian transsexual has chosen to die by euthanasia after a botched sex change operation to complete his transformation into a man left him a 'monster'. Nathan Verhelst, 44, died yesterday afternoon after being allowed to have his life ended on the grounds of 'unbearable psychological suffering'. It is understood to be the first time someone in Belgium has chosen euthanasia after a sex-change, and comes soon after it emerged that it is now the cause of nearly one in 50 deaths in the country. Scarred: Nathan Verhelst, 44, who died yesterday afternoon after finding life unbearable since his sex change operation. The scars from his surgeries on his chest and forearm are visible in this photograph . Mr Verhelst died after a lethal injection administered by the same doctor who last year ended the lives of congenitally deaf twins who were also going blind. Born a girl named Nancy, his transformation into a man began with hormone therapy in 2009, followed by a mastectomy and finally an operation to construct a penis last year. But the procedures did not go according to plan. In the hours before his death he told Belgium's Het Laatse Nieuws: 'I was ready to celebrate my new birth. But when I looked in the mirror, I was disgusted with myself. Heartbreaking end: It is understood to be the first time someone in Belgium has chosen euthanasia after a sex-change, and comes soon after it emerged that it is now the cause of nearly one in 50 deaths in the country . In 2002 Belgium became the second country in the world, after The Netherlands, to legalise euthanasia. Since then, an increasing number of people have chosen to die using this method. In 2012, 1,432 people were allowed to go through assisted suicide indicating a 25 per cent increase in the number of assisted deaths. Guidelines set out by the country's parliament mean patients wishing to end their own lives must be conscious when they ask to die. They also have to be under a 'constant and unbearable physical or psychological pain' resulting from an 'accident or incurable illness'. A survey earlier this year found 32 per cent of assisted deaths are done without request and 47% of the assisted deaths go unreported. In one case, a 44-year-old woman with chronic anorexia nervosa, an eating disorder, was euthanised, along with a 64-year-old woman who was suffering from chronic depression. The Belgian parliament is reportedly on the verge of passing legislation that would allow people under 18  to consent to euthanasia. 'My new breasts did not match my expectations and my new penis had symptoms of rejection. I do not want to be... a monster.' His family learned of his decision this morning via a farewell letter. Mr Verhelst's decision comes amid a . fierce debate over euthanasia in Belgium, where the number of deaths due . to the controversial practice soared by 25 per cent last year.' Official figures showed the numbers . opting to end their lives leap from 1,133 in 2011 to 1,432 in 2012, a . figure representing about two per cent of all deaths in the country. Euthanasia . is legal under Belgian law if those making the decision can make their . wishes clear and are suffering unbearable pain, according to a doctor's . judgement. The Belgian law differs from that of Switzerland, famous for its Dignitas clinic, where only 'assisted suicide' is permitted. This means patients must play an active role in the administration of the drug that ends their lives. Wim . Distelmans, a cancer specialist who carried out the euthanasia of Mr . Verhelst, is the same doctor who last year ended the lives of deaf twins . Marc and Eddy Verbessem, who were both going blind. The . 45-year-olds, from the village of Putte, near the city of Mechelen, had . lived together their entire adult lives and could not communicate with . the outside world. The Dignitas building in Pfaeffikon near Zurich: . In contrast to Belgian rules, under Swiss law only 'assisted suicide' is permitted - meaning patients must take an active role in . administering the drug that ends their lives . Suicide rates among transsexuals and those who have undergone gender reassignment surgery are high with some suggesting the rate may be as high as 31 per cent. Chris Hyde, professor at the University of Exeter, who has studied the issues surrounding sex change operations, told MailOnline: ‘Research we conducted a decade ago found there is huge uncertainty over whether changing someone's sex is a good or a bad thing. ‘While no doubt great care is taken to ensure that appropriate patients undergo gender reassignment, there's still a large number of people who have the surgery but remain traumatised - often to the point of committing suicide. ‘While we haven’t looked at the situation since then, given the difficulties in researching this area, it is likely that the same issues remain today.’ Their . brother, Dirk Verbessem, said at the time that they were terrified of . never being able to see each other and feared losing their independence . in an institution. Professor . Distelmans agreed to end their lives - again on grounds of 'unbearable . psychological suffering' - after their local hospital had denied their . request for euthanasia. Dr Distelmans told the Telegraph: 'The choice of Nathan Verhelst has nothing to do with fatigue of life. 'There . are other factors that meant he was in a situation with incurable, . unbearable suffering. Unbearable suffering for euthanasia can be both . physical and psychological. 'This was a case that clearly met the conditions demanded by the law. Nathan underwent counseling for six months.' Last . week it emerged that a staggering one in 30 deaths in the Netherlands . are now from euthanasia, after Dutch government allowed mobile death . squads to kill sick and elderly people in their homes. The . country became the first in the world since Nazi Germany to legalise . euthanasia when in 2002 it approved doctor-administered lethal drugs for . terminally ill people facing unbearable suffering. Deaf twins chose to die after learning they would go blind . The cancer specialist who euthanised Nathan Verhelst is the same doctor who ended the lives of deaf twins who chose their fate after learning they would soon go blind.Marc and Eddy Verbessem, pictured below, 45, had lived together their entire adult lives and could not communicate with the outside world.Their brother, Dirk Verbessem, said they were terrified of never being able to see each other and feared losing their independence in an institution. Marc and Eddy Verbessem, 45, had lived together their entire adult lives and could not communicate with the outside world . 'That was for my brothers unbearable,' said Mr Verbessem, 46. 'They lived together, did their own cooking and cleaning. You could eat off the floor. Blindness would have made them completely dependent.' The twins, from the village of Putte, near Mechelen, were told they would go blind from a genetically caused form of glaucoma. The pair communicated with each other using a special sign language understood only by them and their close family. They died by lethal injection  at Brussels University Hospital in Jette just before Christmas last year, dressed in new shoes and suits, with Mr Verbessem and their parents, Mary and Remy, by their sides. Mr Verbessem said: 'Marc and Eddy waved again at us. ""Up in the sky,"" they said. ""Up in the sky,"" we replied. And then it was over.'","Nathan Verhelst, 44, born Nancy, was disappointed with sex-change results .

"Labour MP Simon Danczuk said survivors of child abuse could be forced to take ‘direct action’ Theresa May’s shambolic handling of the government’s historic child abuse inquiry looks like a ‘deliberate’ attempt to stop victims getting to the truth, a Labour MP has claimed. Simon Danczuk said survivors of abuse could be forced to take ‘direct action’ if the Home Secretary fails to get a grip. The remarks, which sparked a furious backlash, come after Mrs May revealed that an independent panel set up to support the planned public inquiry could be disbanded. Some victims’ groups welcomed the move despite warnings it could delay the inquiry for ‘yet more weeks and probably months’. Mr Danczuk said victims would be dismayed at the lack of progress in the probe, and could not help worrying that the litany of mistakes was party of a wider cover up. Mrs May signalled a potential shift of approach last week when she told MPs that she wanted the wide-ranging inquiry - which is without a chairman following the resignation of two previous appointees - to be given extra powers. That could mean waiting for a chairman to be appointed for the inquiry panel, which would then be given statutory powers, or setting up a new inquiry panel under statutory terms. The third option of a Royal Commission - which many prefer - would not have the powers of a statutory inquiry under the 2005 Inquiries Act and would be ''legally more risky''. Previous appointments as inquiry chairwomen, Fiona Woolf and Baroness Butler-Sloss, resigned following revelations over the connection to former Conservative Home Secretary Leon Brittan, who has been accused of not following up accusations about a VIP child abuse ring in Westminster. In a letter to the panel members, reported by the investigative website Exaro News, Mrs May said: ‘I am currently considering these options and I appreciate this has implications for members of the panel.’ In a reply to Mrs May obtained by Exaro, panel member Sharon Evans, of the child safety group Dot Com Children's Foundation, said: ‘I, like other members of the panel, feel devastated at the prospect of the independent inquiry being halted as it has been made clear to us 'off the record' that the panel will be stood down in the new year.’ But Peter Saunders, of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said if the inquiry does not have confidence of abuse survivors, it will be ‘meaningless’ and starting the process again should not be a ‘huge trauma’. ‘If indeed the decision has been made or is made to disband the panel as it is currently constituted, then I know that that would be supported by the vast majority of survivors or survivor organisations that we are in touch with,’ he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. ‘I have yet to encounter any survivors who have any faith in the process, or in the panel as it is currently constituted. ‘We need to have a transparent, open recruitment or a panel with appropriate skills and expertise, all done out in the open, nothing to do with nepotism or connections with people already in the establishment. ‘There are some very good people on that panel as it stands at the moment, but there are one or two characters who sadly have association with the past that would make them inappropriate.’ Labour said the Home Secretary Theresa May 'should be utterly ashamed of the process she has overseen' Mr Danczuk told Today the situation is a ‘mess’. ‘What I suspect will happen, because we are not getting any satisfaction from Government, because we are not moving forward and it has been six months now - documents going missing, chairmen having to stand down and resign, the Wanless whitewash review into lost documents, terms of reference not being appropriate and now the panel being disbanded - I think that people will turn to more direct action and you can hardly blame them. ‘What you do need is a mixture of people on that panel who have a whole variety of experiences. I think the Home Secretary had got it broadly right in terms of the people that she appointed. ‘Where she got it badly wrong is in terms of the process, the consultation with key stakeholders in this case the survivors of child abuse.’ Mr Danczuk said he expected there would be ‘more and bigger peaceful protests, more challenging of ministers, more challenging of the police to take action’. ‘I have supported her (Mrs May) on previous occasions ... but it is time and time again, and now this arrangement,’ he said. ‘There is very little faith in Government in terms of delivering this. ‘If Government are set on doing this then it can be achieved. But you can't help thinking that they are not intent on getting this right. ‘There is a catalogue of mistakes that have been made, some of them fairly basic, and you can't blame the survivors of child abuse for wondering - because of the allegations of high-profile figures involved in the abuse - you can't help thinking that some of this is quite deliberate mistakes. ‘They don't want to get to the truth, that would be the allegation.’ Former children's minister Tim Loughton said the independent panel should be allowed to get on with its work . Former children's minister Tim Loughton said the inquiry would be set back by ‘yet more weeks and probably months’. ‘All of the survivors that I have seen on a one-to-one basis or as part of the Home Affairs Select Committee, have said 'Look, we need to get on with this. We need this inquiry to get to the truth',’ the Tory MP told Today. ‘This panel is not perfect, but there are some very well-qualified, decent people on the panel. They have given up their time, they have started their work. ‘They have lost two chairmen, they have got on with their work ... ‘So now to say “Look, sorry, but you are all going to be sent back home again”, I think it is very unfortunate and rather disrespectful to the panel members. ‘It is just going to set the inquiry back yet more weeks and probably months.’ A Home Office spokesman said: ‘The Home Secretary is determined that appalling cases of child sexual abuse should be exposed so that perpetrators face justice and the vulnerable are protected. ‘She is absolutely committed to ensuring the Independent Panel Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse has the confidence of survivors. ‘The Home Secretary is also clear that we have to balance the need to make progress with the need to get this right.’ Shadow Home Office minister Diana Johnson said: ‘The Home Secretary should be utterly ashamed of the process she has overseen. ‘We are now in a position where there is no chair and no panel, while no work has been done on examining the horrible crimes of the past or into the flaws in the current child protections system. ‘Theresa May needs to take responsibility for the utter failure to get this vital work off the ground over such a long period. ‘This is not the first time inquiries have been held on difficult and sensitive issues. Neither the Hillsborough inquiry led by the Bishop of Liverpool nor the Bichard inquiry into child protection was mired in this chaos and confusion. ‘The Home Secretary has failed time and time again to set up an inquiry which commands the confidence of the public.’ Over the weekend it emerged that Labour MP John Mann has handed Scotland Yard a dossier including allegations about the involvement of 22 politicians - some of them apparently still serving - in paedophile rings. The names are said to include 14 ex-ministers.","Simon Danczuk said victims  dismayed at the lack of progress in the probe .

"A British university handed  tens of thousands of pounds to North Korean students so they could learn about computer hacking in the UK. Two students from the secretive state were given £28,000 bursaries by London's University of Westminster to study on a IT course  which includes a module on computer security. Details of their UK training emerged as  Kim Jong-Un's regime ratcheted up the rhetoric in the wake of claims it hacked Sony because it disliked a film the company was due to release. Computer science students at a university in Pyongyang. It has emerged two students from the country were given bursaries to study in Britain on a course which including a module on hacking. File photo . The two students are thought to be the children of powerful figures in the pariah state's ruling elite. They came from the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST), a western-backed, all-male institution in North Korea's capital, where senior politicians and generals send their sons. They were sent to Britain to study an MSc in post-graduate electronic, network and computer engineering. As part of the deal, their flights, accommodation and course fees were covered by the university, which raised the money from the fees of other overseas students. The course includes 'techniques to secure computer networks, and critically evaluates them in the light of a variety of types of attacks', The Telegraph reported. Kim Jong-Un's regime has been widely accused of carrying out a computer hack on Sony after the film company produced The Interview, a movie seen to make fun of the authoritarian ruler . Westminster University insists the students were brought over as part of a scheme to 'broaden minds' A spokesman for Westminster University told the newspaper: 'The scholarship with PUST has been undertaken for a number of years, although we have not awarded any such scholarships to students in the current academic year. 'The scholarships are assessed on academic merit and entry into the UK is undertaken through the standard Home Office and Immigration processes.' It comes after it emerged the UK government is funding places for more than 40 North Korean students to study media and the internet. The Foreign Office, which is funding that scheme but has no part in the University of Westminster course, said: 'It is just one part of our critical engagement to try to improve the lives of those who live in North Korea.' North Korea has poured resources into a sophisticated cyber-warfare wing of its military, which it calls 'Bureau 121'. Defectors have said the Bureau is staffed by some of the most talented computer experts in the state and is part of an elite spy agency run by the army. The two students, not pictured, are said to have studied a module about computer security. File photo . Jang Se-Yul, who studied  at North Korea's military college for computer science before escaping to the south, said: 'For them, the strongest weapon is cyber. In North Korea, it's called the Secret War. FBI officials have explicitly linked recent cyber-attack on Sony - which was about to release The Interview, a film about North Korea - to the country's regime. North Korea hit back at the claims yesterday, saying in a statement: 'Nothing is a more serious miscalculation than guessing that just a single movie production company is the target of this counteraction. 'Our target is all the citadels of the US imperialists who earned the bitterest grudge of all Koreans. 'The army and people of the DPRK are fully ready to stand in confrontation with the US in all war spaces including cyber warfare space to blow up those citadels.'","Two students from university close to North Korean regime sent to UK .

"Eric Garner (pictured) died uttering the words 'I can't breathe' when he was put in a chokehold by a police officer . The Eric Garner-inspired rallying cry for thousands of protesters over the past month - 'I Can't Breathe' - could soon be trademarked for use on hoodies and t-shirts. An Illinois woman has submitted a request to register the phrase for its use on clothing like that worn recently by activists protesting Garner's death. Garner, 43, died on July 17 following a confrontation with NYPD officers. A video of the incident showed him repeatedly uttering the words 'I can't breathe' as he was put into a chokehold by police who suspected he was selling loose cigarettes. It has since been appropriated by those protesting a recent grand jury decision not to indict Daniel Pantaleo, the officer who grappled with Garner during the incident. The protesters' show of solidarity gained further legitimacy when basketballers LeBron James and Kobe Bryant were photographed wearing t-shirts with 'I can't breathe' emblazoned on them during warm-ups. Now Catherine Crump, 57, has filed paperwork requesting use of the phrase for 'hoodies, t-shirts for men, women, boys, girls and infants', The Smoking Gun reported. The application stated she had been using the phrase since at least August 18. She told the website that she did not personally know the Garner family and had not spoken to them about her application. Despite not giving a reason for why she wanted to trademark the phrase, she denied it was for financial gain, it was reported. Tensions between the NYPD and protesters have escalated in recent days after gunman Ismaaiyl Brinsley three days ago murdered officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, claiming it was an act of justice for Garner and Michael Brown, the two black men recently killed by white police officers. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has now implored protesters to wait until after the funerals of the two policemen before resuming rallies that have roiled the city and beyond over the deaths of black men at the hands of police.

Protesters confront police as they march through Chicago in response to a grand jury decision not to indict the police officers involved in the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner . But de Blasio's plea was quickly dismissed by several activist groups that vowed to continue protests that have stirred the city daily after grand juries chose not to indict police officers who killed Garner in New York and Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. 'It's a time for everyone to put aside political debates, put aside protests, put aside all of the things we will talk about in due time,' de Blasio said in a speech to a charity with close ties to the New York Police Department, two days after Ramos, 40, and his partner, Liu, 28, were killed. The men were shot as they sat in their patrol car in Brooklyn, and their deaths electrified tensions that had been coursing for months between City Hall, the police department and the reform-minded protesters who voted for de Blasio in large numbers.","Catherine Crump, 57, has filed paperwork to trademark 'I can't breathe'

"The body of a British tycoon who plunged to his death from a fourth-floor window was identified by his brother-in-law, an inquest heard today. Scot Young, 52, was found impaled on railings after plummeting 60ft from his £3million penthouse in Montagu Square in Marylebone, London, on December 8. An inquest into his death today heard how his brother-in-law Guy van Ristell formally identified his body at Westminster Public Mortuary. The hearing, at Westminster Coroner's Court, also heard how his daughter Sasha Young provided background details for registration of the body. Scroll down for video . Scot Young, 52 (pictured), was found impaled on railings after plummeting 60ft from his £3million penthouse in Montagu Square, London, on December 8. His body was identified by his brother-in-law Guy van Ristell . The tycoon was killed after falling 60ft from his multi-million pound apartment onto metal railings (pictured) Prior to his death, Mr Young - one of Britain's wealthiest men - was embroiled in a vicious divorce battle with ex-wife Michelle, 49, who claimed he had hidden his huge wealth from investigators. There has been speculation that Russian gangland groups were involved in his horrific death, after he reportedly ran into financial trouble with them. However, a packed public gallery heard today how detectives have dismissed claims the bankrupt entrepreneur died as part of a plot involving his connections to Russian oligarchs. The inquest into his death was opened this morning and adjourned until next month. Coroner's officer Rosalin Thompson said: 'Identification was made by his brother-in-law Guy van Ristell and details were provided by his daughter Sasha Young for registration. 'On Monday, December 8, this gentleman was found impaled on railings outside [his home in] Montagu Square with multiple injuries. 'He was pronounced dead at the scene. 'Police are not treating this death as suspicious' Mr Young was engaged to 29-year-old American fashion designer and TV presenter Noelle Reno (together left). He had been embroiled in a lengthy, bitter High Court divorce battle with his ex-wife Michelle, 49 (right) Adjourning the inquest, Angela Hodes, Westminster assistant coroner, said: 'I will open the inquest touching the death of Scott Guy Young who died on December 8 and I will adjourn that for a coroners review on January 12, 2015.' In the wake of the Dundee-born entrepreneur's death, figures close to Mr Young speculated that his death was not suicide. Scotland Yard insists Mr Young's death is not suspicious but it has emerged that at least six of his friends have died in strange circumstances in the past 10 years. At the weekend, it was revealed that Mr Young, originally from Dundee, once worked for wealthy Dundee licensee Alex Brown, 60, who was found drowned near his luxury yacht in Malaga in 2006. Police probed claims from Brown's family that he may have been murdered after he was seen arguing with a man on the harbour's edge. Lawyer Stephen Curtis was killed when his new helicopter crashed in 2004. Curtis was an associate of oligarch Boris Berezovsky, who also died in mysterious circumstances last year. Johnny Elichaoff, 55, fell to his death from a shopping centre last month. Meanwhile, Robert Curtis, 47, and Paul Castle, 54, fell to their deaths under Tube trains in 2010 and 2012 respectively. There have been allegations that the property mogul was killed after falling foul of Russian mobsters following disputes over cash. However, Scotland Yard has insisted it is not treating his death as suspicious. Mr Young was engaged to 29-year-old American fashion designer and TV presenter Noelle Reno. He had two daughters from his previous relationship. He was involved in a lengthy and bitter High Court divorce battle with his ex-wife for a share of his claimed fortune. Michelle had demanded £300million from her former husband, who she married in 1995 claiming he was worth 'a few billion'. Mr Young, a 'deal fixer' for the super-rich, lived a playboy lifestyle, travelling in private jets, driving supercars and with an international property portfolio. He was said to have counted some of Britain's richest and most powerful figures among his friends, including Topshop mogul Sir Philip Green and the late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky. It is claimed Mr Young made his fortune in the 1990s on the back of a telecoms deal and property ventures, amassing a £2billion fortune. However, he was left bankrupt following a Moscow property deal. Last November, his ex-wife was awarded a £20million settlement and £6million in legal costs after seven years of wrangling. Mrs Young - who had demanded £300million - called the vast sum a disgrace and insisted her ex-husband was still worth billions. He had previously been ordered to pay his ex-wife more than £20,000-a-month in maintenance, and had a six-month stint in jail after refusing to co-operate with investigations trying to track down his fortune.

"Rolling Stone magazine has asked Columbia University's journalism school to investigate a discredited article it ran in November alleging gang rape at a campus fraternity, the New York-based school said. In a rare move for a publisher, the music magazine will get the journalism school to produce an independent review of how it handled the story, which it said showed editorial missteps and discrepancies.

"Overindulging is something we are all guilty of at Christmas. But did you know there are around 6,000 calories lurking in the average Christmas Day feast, putting us at risk of gaining almost half a stone by the New Year. From potatoes roasted in goose fat to celebratory glasses of champagne, it is easy to pack in almost three times your recommended daily allowance in one sitting. And dietitian Helen Bond warns just a few canapes before dinner can add 2,000 calories - equal to a woman's daily recommended allowance - to the festive feast tally. While the temptation can be too much for many, this infographic, produced by Lloyds Pharmacy Online Doctor, offers a host of top tips to surviving the festive period - your waistline unscathed. With the average person consuming a staggering 6,000 calories on Christmas Day, there are a host of tips to help you prepare a lighter festive feast that is kinder to your waistline . From removing the skin of the turkey, to cutting potatoes slightly bigger, and opting for a dark chocolate, it is possible to enjoy a lighter Christmas without missing out. Mrs Bond told MailOnline: 'The average Christmas dinner has 6,000 calories. 'When you consider a woman's daily recommended allowance is 2,000 and a man's is 2,500, that equates to almost three times your daily amounts. 'The more vegetables on your plate, the less room there is for fatty foods, and they can help fill you up for longer.' Meanwhile Lloyds Pharmacy  GP, Dr Minal Bakhai, warned the festive period can be particularly hazardous for those with health condition, including diabetes and high cholesterol and blood pressure. Moderation, they  agree, is key with portion control at the very heart of a healthier Christmas. THE HIDDEN CALORIES IN CANAPES . And the worst offenders on the Christmas party menu? Canapes, said Mrs Bond. Sausage rolls, pigs in blankets, mini tartlets packed with tasty fillings - just a handful of bite-sized appetisers before Christmas dinner can add a staggering 2,000 calories to your festive tally. 'They are so moreish, and we know when our taste buds are overstimulated we are more likely to over indulge,' she said. 'And often they are eaten before a main meal, meaning you could consume your recommended daily allowance of calories before Christmas dinner. 'That is why it is so important to have a really good breakfast, or if you are off to a party a good bowl of soup or cereal to fill you up.' 'It is all about moderation. In the past Christmas used to be about one day, then you had Boxing Day. 'But now it is an entire festive period, it is almost a four-week run up beforehand. Skimming the fat from the top of the gravy and homemade cranberry sauce can combat high fat and sugar levels, helping to reduce  calories . 'If you overeat by 500 calories a day, which is very easy to do, you will start to see your weight increase quickly. Source: Lloyds Pharmacy Online Doctor and Helen Bond . 'A handful of crisps, a glass or two of champagne and it is easy to add 500 calories without realising. 'It is easy when you go to so many parties. 'The key is not to totally abandon your healthy eating principles. There are a number of clever swaps you can make to make a big difference.' EASY SWAPS TO KEEP THE POUNDS OFF . Choosing marinated chicken instead of breaded or deep fried, a handful of Twiglets rather than crisps and rationing the number of nuts you gorge on, can  all help. White turkey meat has lower levels of fat than dark meat, and banishing the skin can cut calories. And when it comes to roast potatoes, cutting each serving slightly larger than normal helps to decrease the surface area absorbing the fat, helping to shave yet more calories from the festive feast. 'They may be small changes, just 50 calories here and there, but they all add up,' Mrs Bond added. 'Five hundred extra calories a day puts on around 1lb a week, which by the end of the festive period could see a person gaining almost half a stone.' BEAT THE BLOAT . And if, like thousands of people you suffer irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), you might have the perfect excuse to avoid the dreaded Brussels sprouts. While full fibre, vitamin C and carotenoids, which boost eye health, they are also packed with raffinose. Raffinose cannot be broken down by the stomach and bypasses the small intestines, travelling straight to the large intestine and colon where bacteria 'have a field day', producing methane gases and triggering bloating. And on top of all that food, Mrs Bond said it is vital to remember the calories you will drink each day, toasting the occasion. Dietitian Helen Bond warned Brussels sprouts contain high levels of raffinose, which cannot be digested by the stomach and so can cause bloating . 'Alcohol is so calorific, a glass of champagne is around 89 calories,' she said. 'And often people top up their glasses without realising how many they are having. 'And once you have had one glass too many, you lose your inhibitions and are more likely to overeat. 'Maybe choose a smaller glass of wine, drink it from a champagne flute, to cut down.' 'That is not to say you have to be party poopers on Christmas Day,' she added. 'But for many by New Year they can gain as much as 5lbs, which is so much harder to lose than it is to gain. 'Opt for a fruit or veggie stuffing over sausage meat, and skimmed or one per cent milk to make bread sauce, rather than cream or whole milk. 'And be aware of your butter intake, at Christmas it is all about brandy butter. But a teapsoon of butter, around 5g, can pack in as many as 45 calories. 'Instead, maybe use lemon juice and if you are craving a mince pie, choose a smaller one. COUNT YOUR CHOCOLATE WRAPPERS TO AVOID TEMPTATION . 'Another popular treat is Christmas chocolates, tubs of Celebrations and Roses adorning tables. 'My tip is to keep hold of your wrappers to track how many you are eating, it is easy to dismiss them because they are small.' As well as clever food swaps, portion control and a little restraint, exercise can help you beat the January weight gain blues. 'Christmas is a time where many people sit down with their families,' she said. 'All exercise habits can go out the window. Swapping white and milk chocolate for dark alternatives can help shave calories from your festive tally . 'But a brisk walk on Christmas Day can counteract some of the indulgence.' 'It all comes down to portion control,' she said. 'Restraint and balancing your food for a more comfortable, less bloated Christmas and an easier New Year. 'One in five people suffer IBS and Christmas often triggers the symptoms, especially with the stressful build-up beforehand. 'Overeating can leave a person feeling bloated and uncomfortable, so it is better to exercise a little restraint and opt for smaller portions of everything, without depriving yourself. 'Treat it like a normal day, enjoy it but don't over do it.' Dr Bakhai echoed the calls for restraint, highlighting the importance for those with existing health conditions. She told MailOnline: 'It is particularly important for people with health conditions, such as high cholesterol and diabetes, to take care over the Christmas period. 'It is important to recognise you are eating a larger than normal meal, full of sugar, fat and carbohydrates, and so sugar levels in particular, may be affected. 'But it is not just one meal, it is the Christmas period. 'For type 1 diabetics they might need to be aware their insulin requirements are likely to go up over the festive period. 'It is about achieving a balance. A simple rule to follow is to fill half your plate with vegetables, a quarter with carbohydrates and the last quarter with lean meat. 'Enjoy it but remember it is not a normal meal, you are going to be indulging a lot more than usual. 'Consider that and eat in moderation and try to balance your meals as much as possible.' Choosing vegetable oil instead of goose fat, watching salt levels and enjoying a hearty breakfast can help .","The average person consumes 6,000 calories on Christmas Day - three times a woman's daily recommended intake .

"Well that's certainly one way to get yourself into the Christmas spirit. An ingenious make-up artist has transformed her own face into that of a stunningly life-like reindeer. Maria Malone-Guerbaa usually focuses on celebrities but decided to give something festive a try. Scroll down for video . Maria Malone-Guerbaa has transformed herself into an incredibly realistic reindeer using make-up . Super-talented Maria - who does her own make-up - has previously transformed herself into the likes of Freddie Mercury and Nelson Mandela. The 40-year-old mother-of-two from London didn't use any prosthetics or special effects for her reindeer look, only her brushes and kryolan paints to recreate antlers, bright eyes and nose. Maria said: 'Everyone always does Santa Claus or elves and I just wanted to do something different. 'Reindeer are such beautiful creatures and I wanted to see if I could become one with the power of makeup illusion.' The make-up artist documented her transformation from human to reindeer in a series of photographs . Maria usually makes herself up as celebrities but wanted to try something different for Christmas . Maria said that her reindeer creation took several hours to complete, 'It took over two hours to build up the shading to create the illusion of depth and hair. 'The makeup effect has received awesome attention and I'm delighted to have inspired so many.' Maria is a freelance make-up and hair artist for films and TV and her work has gone viral after she posted some of her pictures online. Maria opens her eyes at one point in the video, revealing her face through the impressive face paint . Maria even painted her hair in the shape of antlers as part of the amazing transformation . She's always had a passion for art but only started on her celebrity lookalikes when she started doing face painting for parties for her children - Sophia, 12, and Adam, 10. Maria has previously revealed that she started working on her own face as her children would become bored during the process. She said: 'I was practicing on the children at home but they used to get bored so that’s why I started painting my own face.' Maria has previously used her skills to transform herself into celebrities such as the late Freddie Mercury . Maria painted teeth over her own mouth as she used make-up to turn herself into Jack Nicholson . Maria continued: 'I would go up to the kitchen and start painting, it developed over the years, going from this level to the next and now people asking how did I learn to paint like this? 'The famous faces are my favourite because they’ve made me very popular they went viral on Facebook which was a shock. People were messaging me from around the world, it was mad. 'Then the make up world and face painting world started talking to me, and people in Miami called the World Face and Body Painting Association,' Maria said. Maria doesn't just do famous faces her she has transformed herself into a scary clown . Maria says her famous faces take four hours to create and she uses a small eyeliner brush to create the looks . She admits her famous faces can take a while to create: 'They take me about four hours to do as they are very detailed, and I literally use the smallest brush - an eyeliner brush.' Maria says that although she would love to work behind the scenes in Hollywood productions, she will wait a few years before applying for those roles as she is very dedicated to being close to her children as they grow up. 'I don’t feel comfortable about leaving them for months -which is how long it would be if I was working on a film. 'I would also love to work in England or London, which is why I tried the West End shows. I thought I could do something while I’m still near home.' When transforming herself into the Queen Maria even painted on some jewelry and a brooch .

"A group of male politicians have been caught on camera laughing as their fellow MP secretly sniffs a female colleague's coat during a vote in the Greek parliament. To the amusement of the 'sexist and vulgar' group, Grigoris Psarianos can be seen smelling his fellow MP's top after she had taken it off and was sitting several benches in front of him. The incident occurred during the first round of voting to appoint the country's new president last week. Scroll down for video . MP Petros Tatsopoulosas holds his female colleague's coat while MP Grigoris Psarianos gives it a sniff . The men surrounding the two appear to be laughing as Psarianos leans down to smell the coat . Petros Tatsopoulosas (top right holding the coat) and Grigoris Psarianos (top left) were later labelled 'sexist and vulgar' It was done with the assistance of Petros Tatsopoulosas, a fellow MP who held the coat for Psarianos while he leaned in to smell it. The coat's owner, Independent MP Rachel Makri, later said the men were 'dullards, and I don't spend my time with dullards', KeepTalkingGreece reported. Both Tatsopoulosas and Psarianos are former members of the left-wing Syriza party and its newspaper wasted no time labelling them as 'sexist and vulgar' in the wake of the incident. Meanwhile, Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras said today he hoped to avoid a snap general election next year after an improved result for his candidate after the second round of the parliamentary vote. Coat owner Rachel Makri (pictured) later called the two men 'dullards' when asked to comment on the incident . As expected, Greek lawmakers failed to reach a majority in favour of the official candidate, Stavros Dimas, but an improved total from the first round left government lawmakers more optimistic ahead of the decisive final round on December 29. Dimas won 168 votes in the 300-seat parliament, 12 short of the 180 he will need to be elected next week. It was eight more than he scored in the first ballot last week when the coat-sniffing incident occurred. If he misses the threshold, snap elections will be held, potentially handing power to the Syriza party which wants to renegotiate Greece's international bailout and roll back the austerity policies of recent years.","A Greek MP has been caught on camera sniffing a female colleague's coat .

"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has called on anti-police protesters to stand down until after the funeral for two slain Brooklyn officers, but his plea has fallen on deaf ears. Civil rights activists led by Reverend Al Sharpton were quick to dismiss de Blasio's request issued Monday and vowed to carry on protests stemming from the decisions of two separate grand juries not to indict police officers responsible for the killings of Michael Brown in Missouri and Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York. . 'It's a time for everyone to put aside political debates, put aside protests, put aside all of the things we will talk about in due time,’ de Blasio said in a speech to a charity with close ties to the New York Police Department.

Saddened: Mourners visit Monday a makeshift memorial near the site where New York Police Department officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were murdered in Brooklyn . Watershed moment: The deaths of officers Wenjian Liu (left) and Rafael Ramos (right) heightened tensions that had been simmering for months between City Hall,  police department and protesters . Paying his respects: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and his wife, Chirlane McCray, visit a makeshift memorial Tuesday near the site where New York Police Department officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were murdered . New York City's first couple lay a bouquet in East New York Tuesday . The mayor has faced sharp criticism from law enforcement officials for siding with demonstrators in the days after officers Rafael Ramos, 40, and his partner, Wenjian Liu, 28, were gunned down in cold blood while sitting in their patrol car in East New York Saturday. Their deaths heightened tensions that had been coursing for months between City Hall, the police department and the reform-minded protesters who voted for de Blasio in large numbers. Even de Blasio's assurance on Monday that he would attend the slain officers' funerals, normally an unquestioned mayoral duty, took on a political charge. Earlier this month, the city's largest police union said the mayor had abandoned the police and urged members to sign a letter insisting that the mayor stay away from their funeral should they be killed while on duty. Police identified the killer as Ismaaiyl Brinsley, who wrote online that he planned to avenge the deaths of Garner and Brown, who were both unarmed black men killed by white officers. Brinsley killed himself with a shot to the head soon after. ‘Let's comfort these families, let's see them through these funerals,’ de Blasio said in his speech, hours after visiting the officers' grieving families with Bill Bratton, the police commissioner. ‘Then debate can begin again.’ But Al Sharpton said de Blasio's call was too vague to heed. Not listening: Rev Al Sharpton said de Blasio's request to suspend protests was too ill-defined . An activist group denounced the mayor's plea as an ‘outrageous’ attempt to ‘chill’ free expression. Pictured here is a man holding a protest sign during a demonstration against police violcence in Grand Central Station Monday . Sending a message: Activists stage a die-in at Grand Central Station two days after the officers' killings . Protesters plan to continue their activities, despite claims from the NYPD that the officers' killer was inspired by the anti-police movement . ‘Is a vigil a protest? Is a rally?’ Sharpton said in a telephone interview, calling de Blasio's comments ‘an ill-defined request.’ Sharpton, who joined Garner's relatives over the weekend to denounce the slaying of the officers, said he would not change planned prayer vigils at the scene of Garner's death and elsewhere over the coming days to mark the family's first Christmas without him. The Answer Coalition, an activist group, denounced the mayor's plea as an ‘outrageous’ attempt to ‘chill’ free expression. It said it had no intention of cancelling a long-planned protest march on Tuesday evening. At least one small candle-light vigil called for by a separate coalition of groups took place in Brooklyn on Monday evening, an organizer said. De Blasio's remarks came two days after his tense relationship with the city's police unions and rank-and-file officers hit its lowest ebb when two union leaders said the mayor had 'blood on his hands' for the officers' deaths. The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association and the Sergeant's Benevolent Association have accused de Blasio, a Democrat who ran for office on a platform of police reform, of helping incite a loathing of police through public remarks noting that he understood some of the protesters' grievances. Allies: De Blasio and Al Sharpton, pictured here in October at the civil rights leaders' 60th birthday party, have enjoyed a close working relationship . Even if protesters say they will not be quieted, the heads of the city's police unions had agreed to suspend any lobbying efforts tied to the protests until after both officers are buried, Bratton said. Rank-and-file officers have taken to social media sites and message boards to express their frustration with the mayor. On sites like PoliceOne and Thee Rant, officers wrote anonymous posts calling on de Blasio to stay away from the slain cops' funerals. 'A little too little. A little too late,' wrote user Interceptor828. 'I am wondering if he feels that it is worth a confrontation showing up to a funeral no one wants him at.' Another user by the moniker otjkid ranted at the mayor: 'Back peddling too late . You hate us. Get lost. All of sudden you support us with 400 million dollars for what? Cameras lol. Bratton you kissing this guys a*** is disgusting.' Investigators said a video on Brinsley's cell phone showed him filming a protest against excessive police force at New York's Union Square Park. Rejecting the unions' arguments, de Blasio said the attack should not be tied to the recent protests, which in New York have been largely peaceful. But some protesters said the mayor sent the opposite message by using Brinsley's actions as a reason to temporarily stop protests. De Blasio has been on shaky ground with the police department since before he assumed office last January. During the mayoral campaign, the populist Democrat spoke out against the Bloomberg administration's controversial stop-and-frisk policy, accusing police of disproportionately targeting young black men for random searches. De Blasio also has strong ties to Al Sharpton, who has organized numerous rallies protesting against mistreatment of inner city black men at the hands of police officers. Politico wrote that during the campaign last year, de Blasio's aides were convinced that members of his security detail made up of police officers were listening in on his private conversations inside his city-assigned car. According to an unnamed former staffer of the mayor's, de Blasio would leave the vehicle to make sure the officers were not eavesdropping on him .","Reverend Al Sharpton responded to de Blasio's request by saying it was too vague .

He used the same account to announce his intentions to gun down the two officers in Brooklyn, styling it as a revenge attack for the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown. It has since been deleted.

"The U.S. economy grew at a sizzling 5 percent annual rate last quarter, the fastest since 2003, fueled by consumer and business spending. The surge confirmed that the U.S. economy is steadily strengthening and outshining others around the world. The news helped lift the Dow Jones industrial average above 18,000 for the first time. And it could shape the Federal Reserve's decision on when to raise interest rates from record lows. In late-morning trading, the Dow was up 88 points to 18,048. Scroll down for video . The U.S. economy has reached its strongest growth rate in 11 years, boosted by consumer spending such as Black Friday (pictured) In its report Tuesday, the government sharply upgraded third-quarter growth from its previous 3.9 percent estimate. Much of the increase came from consumer spending on health care and business spending on structures and software. The economy has been benefiting from sharply lower energy prices. Cheaper fuel has given consumers and businesses more money to spend on other goods and services that drive growth. Last quarter's economic expansion was the fastest since summer 2003, and it followed a 4.6 percent annual rate in the April-June quarter. The government separately reported Tuesday that in November, consumer spending rose at the fastest pace in three months and income at the fastest in five months. Both figures raised hopes for the 2015 economy. 'After four years of rocky recovery the U.S. economy is now hitting its stride, with a notable acceleration in growth in recent quarters,' said Gus Faucher, senior economist at PNC Financial Services Group. 'And growth should remain good next year, with lower gasoline prices a big plus for consumers.' Tuesday's figures are sure to be closely studied by the Fed. Last week, the central bank ended a policy meeting by saying it would be 'patient' in deciding when to raise rates because the economy wasn't yet fully healthy. Many investors concluded that no rate hike was likely before mid-2015 at the earliest, and they drove stocks to record highs. Unexpectedly strong expansion, though, could escalate pressure on the Fed to raise rates, even though inflation remains below its target of 2 percent. Cynthia Dodd-Simonson shops at a Family Dollar store in Wilmington, N.C. One reason the Fed has kept its benchmark short-term rate near zero since 2008 has been to try to raise inflation from excessively low levels. Also on Tuesday, the University of Michigan said its index of consumer sentiment found that U.S. consumers were more optimistic about the economy than at any other time in the past eight years, buoyed by more jobs and falling gas prices. Two other reports Tuesday were more cautionary: The government said sales of new homes fell in November, evidence that job gains have yet to boost the housing sector. And it said factory orders for long-lasting manufactured goods slumped last month. Still, the overall U.S. economy is showing resurgent strength and putting distance between itself and others around the world. Europe is struggling to grow. So is Brazil. Japan has slid into recession. China is straining to manage a slowdown. Russia envisions a recession next year. Business investment, such as in the container shipping industry, has also fueled the U.S. economy . For the current October-December quarter, most analysts think the U.S. economy is slowing to an annual rate of around 2.5 percent. And they foresee growth around 3 percent in 2015. That would still be the strongest expansion since the economy grew 3.3 percent in 2005, two years before the Great Recession began. The 2007-2009 downturn, the worst since the 1930s, destroyed millions of jobs. Since then, the economy has struggled to regain full health. Even after the recession officially ended in June 2009, the economy has turned in tepid growth averaging 2.2 percent annually. But many economists think growth is set to accelerate as more businesses have grown confident about hiring. The country is on track to have its healthiest year for job growth since 1999. In November, employers added 321,000 jobs, the sharpest one-month increase in three years. With more people working and having paychecks to spend, solid gains are expected in consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of the economy. For the third quarter, consumer spending grew at a 3.2 percent rate, the best showing this year and a full percentage point above the estimate the government made a month ago. The upward revision was driven by higher spending on health care. Business investment spending rose at a 7.2 percent annual rate, 2.1 percentage points above the government's previous estimate. Much of the new strength came from investment in structures and computer software. The estimate released Tuesday was the government's third and final look at third-quarter growth in gross domestic product — the value of all goods and services produced in the United States.","U.S. Commerce Department says the economy grew at a 5 percent rate in the third quarter, the strongest in 11 years .

"The Palace of Monaco has released a set of images of Prince Albert II of Monaco and his wife Charlene posing with their twin babies Jacques and Gabriella at the Princess Grace Hospital in Monaco. The Christmas-themed photographs show a smitten pair of parents gazing at their newborn children, with Princess Gabriella in pink and Prince Jaques in baby blue. Gabriella was born first at 5.04pm, and Jacques at 5.06pm, but it is Jacques who will be the future Prince of Monaco, because of the Mediterranean principality's male inheritance laws. Scroll down for video . The Palace of Monaco have released a set of images of Prince Albert II of Monaco and his wife Charlene posing with their twin babies Jacques and Gabriella at the Princess Grace Hospital in Monaco . They are the first children for the 36-year-old former South African Olympic swimmer, who married Prince Albert II, 56, three years ago. Prince Albert was by his wife's side as the children were delivered on December 10 at the Princess Grace Hospital, which is named after Albert's mother, the late Hollywood star, Grace Kelly. Soon after 7.30pm, 42 cannon shots rung around Monaco, confirming that the babies had been born. Albert had arranged the 42 shots, in place of the 21 that would boom for a single baby. The babies are the first twins in the royal household, which dates back to the 13th Century. Albert has admitted that he did not know the sex of the children before birth: 'It is one of the beautiful surprises that life offers us,' he said. Gabriella was born first at 5.04pm, and Jacques at 5.06pm, but it is Jacques who will be the future Prince of Monaco, because of the Mediterranean principality's male inheritance laws . They are the first children for the 36-year-old former South African Olympic swimmer, who married Prince Albert II, 56, three years ago . In the UK, only one set of royal twins has ever been born - to King James I of Scotland and his wife Joan Beaufort in 1430. It is thought that the twins were welcomed via caesarean section, but the doctor delivering them had no more than a symbolic hand in deciding the destiny of the Grimaldi dynasty. In principle, there's no medical reason a doctor would have an active role in deciding which newborn is delivered first, even in the case of a caesarean section, an expert said. 'The obstetrician will always deliver first the twin that presents itself first when the uterus is opened at the time of caesarean section,' said Dr. Patrick O'Brien, spokesman for Britain's Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. 'We don't decide in advance which twin to deliver first.' Had they both been of the same sex, the first one out would have taken the throne but because the Monégasque twins are a boy and a girl, the boy will automatically inherit.

"Kevin Hart has been asked where he stands with Sony after leaked emails showed that one studio executive labeled him a 'whore' for wanting more money to promote his film on social media. Hart was out in Los Angeles on Monday night when he was asked if her would work for the studio again, but refused to answer the questions. This as a possible new leaked email claims the actor was paid millions to promote two films on Twitter to his 14.8 million followers. Scroll down for video . Keeping quiet: Kevin Hart (above) would not reveal if he would work with Sony again when asked Monday night . Not nice: Hart (above with girlfriend Eniko Parrish) was called a 'whore' by one Sony executive in an email . An affable Hart politely declined to tell a TMZ reporter if he planned on working with Sony in the future, the studio that is releasing his next two films, The Wedding Ringer and Get Hard. 'I don't answer those questions,' said Hart, who went on to say that he is 'politically correct' and 'a happy guy.' Meanwhile, in an email posted to BikiniRobotArmy, a Twitter account that has been posting leaked email exchanges, producer Clint Culpepper responds to an inquiry as to whether or not the actor might send out a tweet promoting the Denzel Washington film The Equalizer by saying, 'Yep. He owes us. I also got him to tweet on NGD. We paid him an extra 2M to tweet on 2 pictures. Let me [see] what I can do. What would you have him tweet? A :15 spot saying check it out and I can’t wait to see this? Or ""how excited am I to see Equalizer this weekend?""'

"An unlicensed doctor suspected of negligently infecting more than 100 villagers in northwestern Cambodia with HIV has been charged with murder and other crimes. Yem Chhrin was charged with murder carried out with cruelty, intentionally spreading HIV - human immunodeficiency virus - and practicing medicine without a license. Health officials say 106 people out of more than 800 tested in Roka village were found to have the virus. A team of specialists, including experts from the U.S. and the UN, have been sent to Cambodia's Battambang province (pictured) to determine the scope of the HIV transmission . Yem Chhrin is being held pending further investigation, although officials have declined to say what penalty might be applied for the crimes. Cambodia has no death sentence. Cambodia's prime minister Hun Sen last week appealed to villagers not to lynch Yem Chhrin, who was later taken into protective custody and then arrested at the weekend. Seng Loch, a senior provincial police officer, said the suspect acknowledged reusing syringes for treatment of patients, a practice that can spread HIV. Mr Seng Loch said: 'He told us that he had no intention of spreading HIV to villagers. He doesn't know who among his patients was infected with HIV. He added that Yem Chhrin claimed to frequently change the needles he used for injections. The police officer said that the 53-year-old had been popular in the community because of his kindness and health care treatments, which he had been carrying out for many years even though he had no formal medical training or certification. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen (pictured) last week pleaded with villagers not to lynch the doctor. The doctor was later taken into protective custody by police . Cambodian media have reported that the infected villagers range in age from 3 to 82 years old and include Buddhist monks. The Health Ministry said in a statement last week that a team including experts from U.S. and UN agencies had been sent to Battambang province 'to determine the source, extent and chain of transmission of HIV infection.' Cambodia had a high HIV prevalence rate of 2.0 percent in 1998, but an aggressive campaign to promote safe sex brought the figure down to an estimated 0.7 percent this year, according to the U.N. agency that spearheads the worldwide fight against AIDS.","Cambodian village doctor  arrested following outbreak of HIV .

"A student has broken a 19-year silence and revealed she was the iconic sun baby in hit TV show Teletubbies. Jess Smith, from Chatham, Kent, was selected to be the giggling baby sun who looks over Teletubbyland when she was just nine months old. The show was a global hit and Miss Smith, a first-year dance education student at Canterbury Christ Church University, became one of the most famous faces in the world - but only her family knew it was her. Jess Smith (pictured left and right as a baby) was chosen as the giggling baby sun who looks over Teletubbyland when she was just nine months old - but kept her role a secret for 19 years . There were rumours the true identity of the baby was another Jessica Smith - the 27-year-old star of American teen soap Laguna Beach. But Miss Smith has finally gone public and spoken for the first time about her role in the TV show which featured characters Tinky-Winky, Dipsy, Laa Laa and Po. Miss Smith only revealed her secret during a game with her university friends - where they all had to say something about themselves that no one else would guess. She then used Facebook to confirm it was her - and photos show she still has the same cheeky face. Miss Smith said: 'I thought I may as well tell them as I'm going to be spending the next three years with them. My mother is really chuffed.' Miss Smith revealed her secret during a game with her university friends where they all had to say something about themselves that no one else would guess - she is pictured left and right as the smiling sun baby . She then made the news public on Facebook. She wrote: 'So I've recently celebrated my 19th birthday and after a lot of thought, I've decided it's time to tell everyone. 'I used to hide it but after a lot of encouragement from my friends at university, I've gained the confidence to come out with it. 'I am the sun from Teletubbies. There has been quite a few people pretending to be 'the sun' but only I could tell you the real story.' Miss Smith is now a first-year dance education student at Canterbury Christ Church University . Miss Smith added: 'Everyone says they can see the likeness between my face now and me as a baby. I still have a baby face. I haven't changed much either. I am still giggly.' Miss Smith posted a picture of a letter her parents received from Courtyard Productions in Four Elms, Kent, on June 17, 1996, on Facebook proving she was the baby - not the American TV star Jessica Smith. She said: 'I'm not sure why the actress is claiming to be the face or why people think she is. 'She would have been 10 at the time of filming - and she doesn't even look like the baby. 'My neighbours said I should put everyone right as they would be annoyed if it was them. But I wasn't that bothered until I told my uni friends. 'I am not sure why they picked me - I assume because I was more giggly than everyone else.' She added: 'I do remember watching the Teletubbies when I was a child. 'When I was young I used to laugh along with the sun but it was only when I got older that I understood it was me. 'My close friends and family knew, but it just never interested me before to tell everyone. 'At uni we had to tell the person sitting next to us something about ourselves so I thought I would say it. 'Then people from uni convinced me to tell everyone and they encouraged me through it all. 'I am proud. I wouldn't change it for anything. 'My family will all remember it for ever. My nan has articles about me when I was baby all over her wall.' As no one could predict the success of Teletubbies (pictured) Jess was paid £250 and given a box of toys . Her name was put forward when her mother Anji Smith, 44, a recruitment consultant, took her to be weighed at Edenbridge Hospital, Kent. A health visitor had been asked by Ragdoll Productions to find smiley babies. Miss Smith was put in a high chair for the filming so she would be looking down like the sun. Her father Bill, 49, made her giggle by playing with a teddy bear behind the camera. As no one could predict the success of the show, Jess was paid just £250 for filming and given a box of toys to take home. Delighted Mrs Smith said: 'It was just something a bit different to do and we didn't expect it to be as big as it was. Miss Smith (pictured left) with a friend, said she is not disappointed by her small payment of £250 . 'They just sat her in front of a camera and she just laughed and smiled at her dad.' Miss Smith said she is not disappointed by her small payment of £250. The production company also sent the family a video of her performance and told them when the first show would be aired on TV. She said: 'I am sure I loved the box of toys. 'No one knew how big the show was going to be so we didn't get offered royalties. ' She added: 'People told my mum that I should have gone into modeling but she thought it wasn't the right move to make as I was quite shy.' Luckily Jess' little sister Lucy, now 17, hadn't been born when she took part in the filming so there were no arguments over who got the part. The BBC is preparing to make 60 new episodes of the hugely popular 90s children's television show.","Jess Smith, 19, was chosen as giggling sun when she was nine months old .

"New York Mayor Bill de Blasio feared police officers were spying on his conversations during his election campaign last year, it has emerged. In an early sign of his tension with the force, de Blasio's team was 'convinced' that members of his police detail were listening in on his private conversations inside his city-assigned car, a former de Blasio aide has told Politico. De Blasio would even step into the street to make sure he was out of their earshot, the aide added. The mayor's office has not yet responded to a request for comment on the claims. Scroll down for video . Fears: Bill de Blasio, pictured on the campaign trail in September 2013, had fears at the time that police officers were listening to his private conversations, according to one of his former aides . They have been made as tensions between the mayor and the NYPD are at an all-time high, with many accusing de Blasio of inciting violence against police officers. They say his distrust ultimately led to the murders of two officers in a patrol car in Brooklyn on Saturday. The vitriol towards de Blasio comes after he threw his support behind crowds protesting police violence in the aftermath of the deaths of unarmed black men Eric Garner and Michael Brown at the hands of white officers. After expressing his shock that grand juries had failed to indict the officers involved in the cases, de Blasio also explained that he has long warned his teenage son Dante - who is mixed race - to be careful of his conduct around police. He has also been pictured with civil rights activist Rev. Al Sharpton and invited him to City Hall, where he denounced the police - as he sat at a table with Police Commissioner Bill Bratton. Earlier this month, the city's largest police union said the mayor had abandoned the police and urged members to sign a letter insisting that the mayor stay away from their funeral should they be killed while on duty. This weekend, following the deaths of Wenjian Liu, 32, and Rafael Ramos, 40, cops made their contempt for de Blasio known by turning their backs on him as he arrived at the hospital where the bodies were taken. Reject: De Blasio (circled) visited the hospital where two slain police officers were taken this weekend and officers turned their backs on him. They accuse him of siding with protesters rallying against cop violence . Opposition: After the deaths of the two police officers, Twitter users suggested de Blasio's opposition to the cops was responsible for the killings, including former New York Governor George Pataki, pictured . Fallout: Police Commissioner Bill Bratton (right) has said attitudes towards the police mirror those in the 1970s.  De Blasio (left) has now called upon protesters to stand down until after the officers' funerals . Two union leaders also said the mayor had 'blood on his hands' for the officers' deaths. Former NYPD detective Bo Dietl even compared him to 'Big Bird' as he spoke to Page Six. 'He's tall and he's silly and he doesn't know what he is doing,' he said. 'He knows nothing about policing. He knows nothing about ""stop and frisk"".' On Monday, Bratton told the Today show that tensions are as bad as the 1970s, when New York City was rocked by racial clashes and 60 officers were killed in the line of duty. By Monday evening, de Blasio reinforced Bratton's call for protesters to stand down until after the funerals for the slain Brooklyn officers. 'It's a time for everyone to put aside political debates, put aside protests, put aside all of the things we will talk about in due time,’ he said said in a speech to a charity with close ties to the NYPD. The plea fell on dead ears. NYPD officers: The gunman  fired a fatal round of bullets at Wenjian Liu (left) and Rafael Ramos (right) Condolences: De Blasio and Bratton visited the home of Ramos to pass on their condolences on Monday . Civil rights activists, led by Sharpton, were quick to dismiss de Blasio's request and vowed to carry on protests stemming from the decisions of the grand juries not to indict police officers. 'It's a time for everyone to put aside political debates, put aside protests, put aside all of the things we will talk about in due time,’ de Blasio said in a speech to a charity with close ties to the New York Police Department. Sharpton, who joined Garner's relatives over the weekend to denounce the slaying of the officers, said he would not change planned prayer vigils at the scene of Garner's death and elsewhere over the coming days to mark the family's first Christmas without him. On the other side of the tension, rank-and-file officers took to social media sites and message boards to express their frustration with the mayor. On sites like PoliceOne and Thee Rant, officers wrote anonymous posts calling on de Blasio to stay away from the slain cops' funerals. Support: On Tuesday morning, de Blasio and his wife, Chirlane McCray, visited a makeshift memorial near the site where the officers were murdered in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn on Saturday . 'A little too little. A little too late,' wrote user Interceptor828. 'I am wondering if he feels that it is worth a confrontation showing up to a funeral no one wants him at.' Another user, otjkid, ranted at the mayor: 'Back peddling too late . You hate us. Get lost. All of sudden you support us with 400 million dollars for what? Cameras lol.' Killer: Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, shot dead the police officers and then took his own life in the subway . But David Axelrod, Obama's longtime adviser, told Politico that de Blasio's struggle between speaking the truth to the police while also wanting to hold his power is not a new problem. 'My sense is that he sincerely appreciates both the hard job the police do and the gulf that exists today, and is trying to close that breach,' Axelrod said. 'And he has to weather the storm and speak hard truths to police and the community and over time, the public will appreciate his role as a rational voice, trying to heal the city and move forward.' Others told the publication that the mayor 'doesn't have a clue' - citing his relationship with City Hall staffer Rachel Noerdlinger, whose son and boyfriend posted anti-police remarks on Facebook. Even when the comments emerged - as well as the fact her boyfriend had tried to drive a police officer off the road in New Jersey - the mayor stood by her. She eventually left the job. 'His words and his deeds don't match,' said veteran cop reporter Leonard Levitt. 'You had Noerdlinger's son calling cops 'pigs' and de Blasio doesn't think that's inappropriate? What message are you sending? 'De Blasio says it's just the union guys who are angry. It's not. It's everybody. I've been covering this for 25 years and I have never seen anything like it… The mayor doesn't have a clue.' A message to New York . Over the past weeks, many in this city and across the nation have been attempting to define the New York City Police Department in their own terms. They are attempting to answer for themselves questions about who we are, what we do, and how we do it. But the men and women of this Department know exactly who we are: we are Police Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos. They were loving fathers, husbands, and sons—points of great pride for their communities. They were also part of our NYPD family, bonded by the experiences, triumphs, and challenges we face so that others won’t have to. They dedicated their lives to the defense of others, and understood what that commitment could ultimately mean. They were people of faith, of conviction, and of principle. They answered the call to service, and did so each and every day they wore the uniform. They were devoted to the protection of this city and the safety of its people. They didn’t do this work to be thanked, congratulated, or admired. They did it because it must be done, because we all have the basic right to live free from fear. And with all of us, they stood tall to guard those who cannot guard themselves, to shield the frightened, the weak, and the vulnerable. We are their memory. We are their legacy. And we still stand. These deaths cast a dark cloud on the rest of our holiday season and the flags will remain at half-staff past Christmas. But as we mourn their sacrifice, we also honor them through the work we do every day. May God grant Officer Wenjian Liu and Officer Rafael Ramos rest. And may God bless the New York City Police Department. William J. Bratton .

"If you are somebody who prefers to call a spade a spade, then you are probably not going to like this much. A Phoenix-based entrepreneur has invented what he describes as the 'Ergonomic Shovel' with a rotating handle in the middle of the shaft. The design is apparently intended to help improve posture and reduce back strain and wrist pain while digging. Scroll down for video . Ace of spades: Shovels have been used to work the land and clear snow by humans for millennia but this design is claimed to make the whole process of digging and moving dirt around 30 per cent easier . However, the hi-tech spade is not likely to actually do any of the hard work itself and still requires a fair bit of effort. The age-old problem of spreading butter straight from the fridge has finally been solved with a gadget that has 21 triangular holes that 'grate' the solid buttery block. The tiny strips are much easier to spread than a knife loaded with cold butter so sandwich fans can finally avoid tearing holes in their bread trying in vain to get an even coating. The other side of the knife has a serrated edge so that it can be used to cut the sandwich or toast in half or get rid of the crusts. Until now, the only way to guarantee a smooth spread has been to take the chilled butter out of the fridge and let it warm up on the side. But another invention uses a blade that transfers body heat to melt through hard butter. The technology means the device requires no batteries, charging or power of any sort. Its designers developed the device using a copper alloy tube which instantly transfers heat from the palm of a hand to the end of the blade. The new design was dreamed up by Stephen Walden after waking up stiff and sore each morning while  digging for his parents. He has built a ring-shaped structure in the middle of a fibreglass shaft, which contains a handle that can be rotated by 360 degrees and locked into 16 different positions. The idea is to allow users to set the angle that best suits them and the job they are doing. Mr Waldon, 25, from Phoenix, Arizona, claims that it is the first major revolution in spade technology in thousands of years. He said: 'It shouldn’t be normal to wake up sore everyday after using these tools, so why not come up with a way to make them easier to use. 'I was using other tools as well, with perpendicular handles, like hedge trimmers and weed whackers, when I realized that this handle configuration can be used on a simple shovel. 'For thousands of years, we have grown accustomed to using traditional tools - to the point where we expect them to cause pain and injury. 'But research shows that we can decrease workplace injury by adding ergonomics to the equation. We have redesigned the shovel to reduce injury' Mr Waldon came up with the idea after doing some work in a community garden with his mother and helping his father out on properties he owns around Phoenix. Revolutionary idea: Shovel has a circular section in the shaft containing a handle that rotates 360 degrees . No pain, no gain? Inventor Charles Waldon came up with the idea after getting sore doing work for parents . Phoenix-based Charles Waldon has patented the design and is now selling commercial models of his spades . After building a prototype from PVC pipe and glue, he patented the idea before appealling to crowdfunding site KickStarter to help him raise the money to build a commercial product. He has now set up a company called Bosse Tools to produce the spades. These include two designs for digging - which cost $69 (£44) and another for shovelling snow, which costs $79 (£50). Mr Waldon claims that tests with his spade by students at Arizona State University have shown that it can reduce the strain on arm and lower back muscles when digging and lifting. Erin Harper, a kinesiology instructor at Arizona State University, said: 'We know from previous reports on snow shoveling injuries that a large number of injuries come from musculoskeletal exertion. 'If a person can complete the same task with less muscle activity, the onset of fatigue may be delayed, which may help prevent musculoskeletal injuries that usually result from compromised or poor movement technique.' Spade handles: New shovel comes in three designs for moving snow (left) and digging (middle and right) Technology has transformed the simple task of digging but it's unclear how it helps when carrying wood .","Phoenix based inventor designed gadget after getting sore while digging .

"Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul may have just announced his 2016 White House run – in a tweeted photo of a mock turtleneck sweater sporting a presidential campaign message. Paul, a likely but unconfirmed White House contender, was sending his annual 'airing of grievances' tweets as part of the fictional 'Festivus' holiday, made popular in the 1990s 'Seinfeld' sitcom. 'I've got a lot of problems with you people (mostly in DC),' he tweeted, 'and today you're going to hear about it! Stayed tuned for #festivus grievances.' And what started as jabs about sweater vests worn by fellow Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum quickly switched on Washington's buzz machine when he added a Photoshopped pic of the garment sporting a 'Rand Paul 2016' slogan. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Did a US senator just announce he's running for president on Twitter, or is he toying with us? Kentucky Republican Rand Paul tweeted this photo on Tuesday . Paul is an unconfirmed presidential contender but is expected to join a broad GOP field in the coming months, but he could just be referring to his Senate re-election bid . Paul's 'airing of grievances started with a jab at incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's fashion sense before he posted his own Photoshopped shirt . 'Festivus' is a made-up secular holiday that the cantankerous 'Seinfeld' character Frank Costanza forced on his family each year two days before Christmas as an alternative to Christmas and Hanukkah. Its celebration, he explained on the show, included a Festivus dinner during which people told their family members 'all the ways they've disappointed you' during the year. Instead of a tree or menorah, the Costanza family erected an unadorned silver 'Festivus pole.' The day-long event also included 'feats of strength' and 'Festivus miracles' – which were ordinary events with simple explanations. Paul's grievances included the gripe that 'no matter how many times I ask [McConnell],' he tweeted with a picture of the incoming Senate majority leader, 'he won't let me borrow this awesome sweater vest.' 'We all know having a fashion forward campaign is important to success, as [Santorum] showed us in 2012 #festivus,' came the second playful poke. But then Paul dropped a potential bombshell. 'Of course, everyone has to be themselves, and I have my own style,' he tweeted. 'I think this will be a popular item this year.' The mocked-up 'Rand Paul 2016' photo accompanied that message. Many who follow the senator on Twitter took him seriously. 'Strangest way to announce you're running for President, achieved.' tweeted one user. 'If Rand Paul just announced his presidential campaign vis a vis a Festivus rant, I have to vote for him. No choicem' wrote another. But others noted that Paul is also up for re-election to the Senate in two years. Asked whether the senator was really making a campaign announcement about the presidency, a Paul spokesman wrote back – complete with a smiley-face emoticon: 'Senator Paul is running for the Senate in 2016 :-)' 'Ive got a lot of problems with you people!': Paul quoted Frank Costanza, a 'Seinfeld' character, who berated his family members around the dinner table two days before Christmas . On 'Seinfeld,' Frank Costanza, the crusty father of George Costanza, created Festivus as an alternative to Christmas and Hanukkah . He has signaled, however, that he could run for both the Senate and the White House simultaneously, a prospect that Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes has said she will try to block. Grimes lost her own Senate bid to McConnell in November by a 15-point margin. 'The law is clear,' she told WHAS-TV a week ago. 'You can’t be on the ballot twice for two offices.' 'At the end of the day, we’re not going to be bullied,' she pledged. Grimes herself could be a Senate front-runner if Paul were forced to choose and picked a presidential bid over running for a second six-year term in Congress. Making a big political announcement on social media isn't unprecedented. Last week former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush used Facebook and Twitter to declare that he was launching a presidential exploratory committee.","Kentucky senator switches on Washington's buzz machine with tweeted photo of a garment sporting a presidential campaign message .

"North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un visited a cat fish farm as computer engineers struggled to restart the hermit state's internet connection. The nation's 1,000 internet connected computers suffered a service outage for ten hours during a suspected cyber attack. While the computers were offline, Kim visited the Pyongyang Catfish farm where he provided 'field guidance' to managers at the plant. Scroll down for video .

Kim Jong-un, centre, looked disinterested as he wondered through the fish farm with hands in his pockets . The North Korean leader, second from left. issued orders to his minions who scribbled furiously on a notepad . Wearing his traditional heavy woolen coat, Kim was surrounded by a group of senior officials, unusually, none of whom were wearing military uniforms, as he looked into a tank containing cat fish. The United States refused to comment whether they were responsible for the ten-hour shut down. The hermit state has been accused of being responsible for last month's highly embarrassing attack on Sony Pictures. South Korean officials said the Korean Central News Agency and the Rodong Sinmun newspaper, which are both used to disseminate propaganda. The outage was probably more inconvenient to foreigners, who can access the Internet through 3G networks, than to North Korean residents, most of whom have never gone online. Outside the plant, Kim, pictured centre, gave officials the benefit of his experience following the inspection . The Korean National News Agency website, pictured, was off-line for ten hours earlier today . The top news item on the website's return was Kim Jong-un's visit to the Pyongyang Catfish plant. There are only about 1,000 Internet Protocol addresses in North Korea for a population of 25 million, South Korean analysts say. The privileged are also allowed to view a self-contained domestic Intranet that carries state media propaganda and a limited amount of information pulled and censored from the real Internet. North Korea did not immediately release a response to the shutdown. But, a communique on the official North Korean news agency website, which had been off line for ten hours, condemned the United States, comparing it to the Roman Empire, which 'was thrown into a dumping ground of history as it collapsed while seeking prosperity through aggression and war'. Internet connections are incredibly rare within North Korea, although more than one million people are believed to have access to a mobile phone.

"From the dingy donut shops of . Manhattan to the cloistered police watering holes in Brooklyn, a . number of black NYPD officers say they have experienced the same . racial profiling that cost Eric Garner his life. Garner, a 43-year-old black man suspected of illegally . peddling loose cigarettes, died in July after a white officer . put him in a chokehold. His death, and that of an unarmed black . teenager in Ferguson, Missouri, has sparked a slew of nationwide . protests against police tactics. On Saturday, those tensions . escalated after a black gunman, who wrote of avenging the black . deaths on social media, shot dead two New York policemen. Retired detective Harold Thomas, a 30-year veteran of the NYPD, says he fell victim to racial profiling when he was off duty and insists: 'If I was white, it wouldn't have happened' The protests and the ambush of the uniformed officers pose a . major challenge for New York Mayor Bill De Blasio. The . mayor must try to ease damaged relations with a police force . that feels he hasn't fully supported them, while at the same . time bridging a chasm with communities who say the police . unfairly target them. What's emerging now is that, within the thin blue line of . the NYPD, there is another divide — between black and white . officers. Reuters interviewed 25 African American male officers on the . NYPD, 15 of whom are retired and 10 of whom are still serving. All but one said that, when off duty and out of uniform, they . had been victims of racial profiling, which refers to using race . or ethnicity as grounds for suspecting someone of having . committed a crime. The officers said this included being pulled over for no . reason, having their heads slammed against their cars, getting . guns brandished in their faces, being thrown into prison vans . and experiencing stop and frisks while shopping. The majority of . the officers said they had been pulled over multiple times while . driving. Five had had guns pulled on them. Desmond Blaize, who retired two years ago as a sergeant in . the 41st Precinct in the Bronx, said he once got stopped . while taking a jog through Brooklyn's upmarket Prospect Park. 'I . had my ID on me so it didn't escalate,' said Blaize, who has . sued the department alleging he was racially harassed on the . job. 'But what's suspicious about a jogger? In jogging clothes?' The NYPD and the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, the . police officers' union, declined requests for comment. However, . defenders of the NYPD credit its policing methods with . transforming New York from the former murder capital of the . world into the safest big city in the United States. The badge and identification card of retired NYPD detective Harold Thomas, who is one of dozens of black cops in New York who say they are also victims of racial profiling . 'It makes good headlines to say this is occurring, but I . don't think you can validate it until you look into the . circumstances they were stopped in,' said Bernard Parks, the . former chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, who is . African American. 'Now if you want to get into the essence of why certain . groups are stopped more than others, then you only need to go to . the crime reports and see which ethnic groups are listed more as . suspects. That's the crime data the officers are living with.' Blacks made up 73 percent of the shooting perpetrators in . New York in 2011 and were 23 percent of the population. Some black NYPD cops say the death of Eric Garner (pictured) could have been avoided and add: 'That could have been any one of us' A number of academics believe those statistics are . potentially skewed because police over-focus on black . communities, while ignoring crime in other areas. They also note . that being stopped as a suspect does not automatically equate to . criminality. Nearly 90 percent of blacks stopped by the NYPD, . for example, are found not to be engaged in any crime. The black officers interviewed said they had been racially . profiled by white officers exclusively, and about one third said . they made some form of complaint to a supervisor. All but one said their supervisors either dismissed the . complaints or retaliated against them by denying them overtime, . choice assignments, or promotions. The remaining officers who . made no complaints said they refrained from doing so either . because they feared retribution or because they saw racial . profiling as part of the system. In declining to comment to Reuters, the NYPD did not respond . to a specific request for data showing the racial breakdown of . officers who made complaints and how such cases were handled. White officers were not the only ones accused of wrongdoing. Civilian complaints against police officers are in direct . proportion to their demographic makeup on the force, according . to the NYPD's Civilian Complaint Review Board. Indeed, some of the officers Reuters interviewed . acknowledged that they themselves had been defendants in . lawsuits, with allegations ranging from making a false arrest to . use of excessive force. Such claims against police are not . uncommon in New York, say veterans. Still, social psychologists from Stanford and Yale . universities and John Jay College of Criminal Justice have . conducted research - including the 2004 study 'Seeing Black: . Race, Crime and Visual Processing' - showing there is an . implicit racial bias in the American psyche that correlates . black maleness with crime. John Jay professor Delores Jones-Brown cited a 2010 New York . State Task Force report on police-on-police shootings - the . first such inquiry of its kind - that found that in the previous . 15 years, officers of color had suffered the highest fatalities . in encounters with police officers who mistook them for . criminals. There's evidence that aggressive policing in the NYPD is . intensifying, according to data from the New York City . Comptroller. Thomas, a former NYPD detective, is suing the city over an altercation with police that he says ended in his head being smashed against the hood of his car . Police misconduct claims - including lawsuits against police . for using the kind of excessive force that killed Garner - have . risen 214 percent since 2000, while the amount the city paid out . has risen 75 percent in the same period, to $64.4 million in . fiscal year 2012, the last year for which data is available. People who have taken part in the marches against Garner's . death - and that of Ferguson teenager Michael Brown - say they . are protesting against the indignity of being stopped by police . for little or no reason as much as for the deaths themselves. 'There's no real outlet to report the abuse,' said Brooklyn . Borough President Eric Adams, a former NYPD captain who said he . was stigmatized and retaliated against throughout his 22-year . career for speaking out against racial profiling and police . brutality. Officers make complaints to the NYPD's investigative arm, . the Internal Affairs Bureau, only to later have their identities . leaked, said Adams. One of the better-known cases of alleged racial profiling of . a black policeman concerns Harold Thomas, a decorated detective . who retired this year after 30 years of service, including in . New York's elite Joint Terrorism Task Force. Shortly before 1 a.m. one night in August 2012, Thomas was . leaving a birthday party at a trendy New York nightclub. Wearing flashy jewelry, green sweatpants and a white . t-shirt, Thomas walked toward his brand-new white Escalade when . two white police officers approached him. What happened next is . in dispute, but an altercation ensued, culminating in Thomas . getting his head smashed against the hood of his car and then . spun to the ground and put in handcuffs. 'If I was white, it wouldn't have happened,' said Thomas, . who has filed a lawsuit against the city over the incident. The . New York City Corporation Counsel said it could not comment on . pending litigation. At an ale house in Williamsburg, Brooklyn last week, a group . of black police officers from across the city gathered for the . beer and chicken wing special. They discussed how the officers . involved in the Garner incident could have tried harder to talk . down an upset Garner, or sprayed mace in his face, or forced him . to the ground without using a chokehold. They all agreed his . death was avoidable. Said one officer from the 106th Precinct in Queens, 'That . could have been any one of us.'","Many black officers say that, when off duty and out of uniform, they have been victims of racial profiling .

"A once obese woman who won a prize to get fit last Christmas is celebrating after shedding eight stone this year. Jenni McFeat, 31 from Winsford, Cheshire, shed the excess weight after she won six personal training sessions with a top coach in a competition he placed on his website. The dental practice support manager is now down to a size 10 after tipping the scales last December 25 at 18st when she wore a size 24. Jenni McFeat has lost an incredible 8st in one year going from 18st and size 24 (left) to just 10st and a size 10 (right) Jenni said: 'I entered the competition because in my mind I knew I had to do something about my weight, . 'Anthony Foy's post about the competition came up on my news feed on Facebook and I thought: ""I could do that"" so my sister told me to enter it. 'I'd never won anything in my life and of all the things to win I didn't want to win this! She entered a competition to win sessions with personal trainer Anthony Foy (pictured with her recently, right) as she knew her weight was out of control (left, before) 'I was devastated, mainly because I was embarrassed to go in the gym, but this time I had no excuses not to go and try it. I started my training the 3rd of January this year and I'd never been nervous before, but when I went to my first session in the gym I was sweating before I'd even got there. 'Afterwards I thought I was going to collapse and my heart rate was through the roof. 'Once I'd recovered though I thought: ""I have to do this. I have two little girls at home that need a healthier mummy.""' Four years ago Jenni's partner cheated on her and she always cited this as the reason for her weight ballooning. After she got over her fear of the gym, Jenni began working out regularly with Anthony as well as transforming her diet and stopping her comfort eating (left, as she started losing the weight) Once she started to lose the weight Jenni's two daughters Freya, 7 and Lillie, 5 were her inspiration for continuing to fight the flab. The three of them used to go camping and Jenni was left humiliated when her girls wanted to play football but knew their mum couldn't join in. She said: 'We go camping quite a lot and the girls always want me to run around playing football but I couldn't. They'd say no mummy can't play. 'Now our whole lives have changed I'm happier and healthier and more relaxed and the girls have a mum they can play with.' Breakfast: A bacon roll and coffee from Greggs . Lunch: Fish and Chips from the local chip shop or a Greggs pasty . Dinner: Massive portion of lasagne . Snacks: Biscuits, chocolates, sweets . Breakfast: Porridge with berries . Lunch: Salad with either turkey or mackerel . Dinner: Steak with sweet potato and vegetables . Snacks: Soft cheese and crispbreads, fruit, mixed nuts, protein shakes . Jenni says her two daughters inspired her to keep going and they all lead a healthier life now . Jenni has also transformed her diet after training with coach Anthony. Before she used to snack on biscuits and chocolates throughout the day and paid frequent visits to the chip shop for her lunch. However, now she snacks on fruit and nuts in between meals of turkey salad and porridge and is delighted with her new 10st figure. Jenni said: 'It was hard and it kept getting harder and the weights kept getting heavier but the results kept coming and that kept me going.'","Jenni McFeat won six personal training sessions with Anthony Foy through an online competition .

"No one wants to be nabbed by the police. But a ride in a state-of-the-art £170,000 McLaren must surely soften the blow. It is a small luxury Dubai's criminals will have to get used to, as the latest addition to the emirates police fleet will be tough to outrun at 207mph. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . State-of-the-art: Dubai Police have added a McLaren MP4-12C to their fleet in a bid to outrun criminals . Luxury: The £170,000, custom-made supercar won 'Car Of The Year' at the Middle East Motor Awards this year. It can reach 207mph, weighs the same as a small Citroen, and has triple the power of a British police patrol car . The McLaren MP4-12C motor joins a garage of the world's most expensive patrol cars including a Lamborghini, an Aston Martin, a Bentley, a Ferrari, and a Chevrolet. They can all exceed 190mph. The latest add-on, built in Woking, has a twin-turbocharged 3.8-litre engine that generates three times the power of the British panda car. And complete with flashing lights, it can accelerate from 0mph to 62mph in 3.1 seconds. Designed by Frank Stephenson, creator of . the Mini Hatch and award-winning Ferraris, it is the first McLaren built . since the F1 was discontinued in 1998. Try getting away from this: One of the Dubai police force's super vehicles, a £1.6million Aston Martin One-77 . Raw power: The Ferrari FF, right, and Lamborghini Aventador, left, outside one of Dubai's police stations . It is made with carbon fibre for minimum weight - just 1,306kg, well below the average of 1,500-1,700kg. In November, it won 'Car of the Year' and 'Best Supercar' at the Middle East Motor Awards. The custom-made vehicle, painted in Dubai's flagship green and white colours, carries a '2020' number plate to celebrate the nation's successful World Expo 2020 bid, which will showcase business, creative, and economic innovation in the country to millions of visitors. The luxurious cars are part of a government-outlined Police Specification, released earlier this year, which ruled top-of-the-range cars are a necessity to fight crime in a city with so many highways. Speeding drivers are even known to plead policemen to detain them and escort them to the station in their cutting-edge vehicle. Officers will take a compulsory driving course then get their pick of the fleet. Arrest me: Speeders have asked to be detained in the new cars, including this Bentley Continental . Supercar: This year, Dubai Police added a white and green £294,665 Lamborghini Aventador to their patrol fleet . Among others, they can choose a limited-edition Lamborghini Aventador - released this year to celebrate the firm's 50th anniversary - to scale the opulent city. Last year Dubai Police took on 50 Kia Mohaves and 35 were marked as patrol cars by the force. Khalifa Abdullah Mohammad, 25, drives one of the 217mph Lamborghini Aventador police cars. He said: 'I have issued about 30 tickets to drivers blocking the traffic and parking in prohibited places. 'But the most amazing thing about driving such a car is how people look at you with a big smile.' Deaths on the road are a common occurrence in the UAE, with one person killed in a traffic incident every 26 hours. Purpose: Cars like this Mercedes SLS Gullwing could help bring down the number of road deaths . Action: The cars were brought in to clamp down on speeding, with one person killed in a crash every 26 hours . Most of these deaths are caused by speeding, driving without a seatbelt and driving while using mobile phones. The police recently announced anyone caught exceeding 125mph would face legal action and it is hoped the presence of 700bhp supercars will make boy racers think twice. Following the arrival of the supercars, some motorists are thought to have actually asked to be arrested in the hope they can be taken back to the local nick in a Ferrari. Mariam Ahmad, who personally owns a Toyota Landcruiser, patrols the streets in a Ferrari FF. She said: 'It is the first time I have driven a sports car. When they chose me I couldn't believe it. Driving it is just amazing. 'It's funny because we hear people begging us to arrest them for any reason so they can have a tour in the Ferrari. 'I miss the car when I'm off duty. My Land Cruiser does not compare.'","State-of-the-art patrol car three times more powerful than British police cars .

"Manchester United could face a battle to retain a string of their most highly-rated young players in 2015. The contracts of six stars - Tyler Blackett, Paddy McNair, Jesse Lingard, Reece James and Andreas Pereira - are due to expire at the end of the season. All five players are, in theory, free to talk to foreign clubs from January 1 and sign a pre-contract agreement for next season, meaning that there is a danger that United could lose them for nothing come the end of the season. Tyler Blackett's contract at Manchester United will expire at the end of the season . Blackett and McNair have both impressed following injuries to United’s senior defenders in the first half of the season. They were particularly impressive in the 2-1 victory at Arsenal. United executives are understood to have held discussions over new a new deal for Blackett although a contract is yet to be finalised. It is unlikely that these youngsters would choose to leave Old Trafford - such has been Van Gaal’s inclination to present them with opportunities - but it still seems curious that United have been sluggish in arranging extensions. Young defenders Blackett and Paddy McNair (right) have impressed after being thrown in at the deep end . United fans will still remember, for example, how Paul Pogba was allowed to leave the club on a free to Juventus in 2012. The one who may appear most likely to move on is 18-year-old Pereira, with sources in Belgium suggesting that he may be tempted to look for regular football elsewhere. Adnan Januzaj, meanwhile, is likely to leave the club on loan in January. Manchester United declined to comment.

"The death of a woman who disappeared near the Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama back in October during a racing weekend has been ruled a homicide. Theresa Benn went missing on October 19 at 7:30 p.m. and her corpse wasn't found until November 22 in the Jackson Shoals area of Choccolocco Creek. The Lincoln Police Department said yesterday that they are still waiting on DNA test results, but are confident they will confirm the body to be that of Benn. Murdered: The death of Theresa Benn who disappeared near the Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama back in October during a racing weekend has been ruled a homicide . Couple's dispute:  Husband Kevin Dulaney (left), told authorities he dropped his wife Theresa Benn (right) near Eastaboga Road about 2:15 a.m. the Sunday she disappeared after the two had an argument . Police say that Theresa Benn who also went by Theresa Andrews, her maiden name, and Theresa Dulaney, her married name, was with her husband before she went missing because she wanted to go to the races and he didn't. Husband Kevin Dulaney, told authorities he dropped his wife near Eastaboga Road about 2:15 a.m. that Sunday. Dulaney said he last saw his wife walking towards the track. AL.com reports that police have not determined whether or not she made it to the Geico 500 later that day but say she did not attend the race on Saturday. Lincoln Police Chief Darren Britton said that the death report says Benn's death was a homicide but they didn't yet say how she was killed. 'We are conducting an active homicide investigation at this time and are pursuing all credible leads,' Britton said. Fought with her husband: Husband Kevin Dulaney, told authorities he dropped his wife near Eastaboga Road about 2:15 a.m. that Sunday after they had an argument about going to the races . 'Our deepest sympathies go out to her family and loved ones during this time and we want to reassure them that we are, and will, continue to work towards a resolution of this case,' Britton added. Lincoln Police Department issued a large search party for the stay at home mother of three after her disappearance in October. 'We had people on ATVs, on foot, and on boats,' Amanda Crowe with the Lincoln Police Department told ABC 33 40 of the multi-agency search for Benn . 'We're still asking for any information from the public,' Crowe also said. 'Anyone that might have saw something or have anything information that we don't already have to come forward.' The Lincoln Police Department said in a release during the search a few months ago, 'On this date at approximately 1:00pm, searchers located the body of a white female in the Jackson Shoals area of Choccolocco Creek. Positive identification of the body was determined by the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences pending their forensic investigation. The release continued 'The search was conducted and coordinated by Lincoln police in conjunction with Texas Equusearch in hopes of locating Theresa Benn, a local woman missing since October 19, 2014. 'Volunteers from Texas Equusearch, members of the community as well as off duty personnel from Lincoln Fire and Rescue, Etowah County Search and Rescue, Talladaga County Sheriff's Office, Talladega County DTF, and Calhoun County Sheriff's Office, took part in the search.

"Smartphones have become so integral to modern life, they may have altered the shape and function of the human brain, according to new research. Experts have discovered that people who use touchscreen phones on a daily basis have a larger and more powerful somatosensory cortex - the area at the centre of the brain which controls the thumbs. They think that the more time someone spends fiddling with their smartphone, the bigger the link between brain and hand. Experts have discovered that people who use touchscreen phones on a daily basis have a larger and more powerful somatosensory cortex - the area at the centre of the brain which controls the thumbs. They think that the more time someone spends fiddling with their smartphone, the bigger the link between brain and hand . Neuroscientist Dr Arko Ghosh, who led a study into the impact of mobile phone use, said our ‘newfound obsession’ with smartphones demonstrated the ability of the brain to mould to its circumstances. But while the brain has long been known to be able to adapt to new demands - such changes can sometimes result in chronic pain and movement disorders. Dr Ghosh of the University of Zurich in Switzerland, said: ‘I think we must appreciate how common personal digital devices are and how densely people use them. ‘The digital technology we use on a daily basis shapes the sensory processing in our brains.’ Smartphones force people to use their hands in ways they have never had to in the history of human evolution. The Swiss team tracked 37 volunteers over ten days - 27 of them using touchscreen phones and 11 using traditional mobile telephones with fixed buttons. Monitoring their brain waves, they found that people using the modern touchscreen phones had altered the form and function of their somatosensory cortex. Writing in the journal Current Biology, the scientists said those who used smartphones had changed the way their thumbs and brains worked together, with a larger effect seen with those who had used their phones more. While using fixed buttons require simple hand movements, using a touchscreen requires a far more complex set of motions. The part of the brain controlling the sense of touch in the thumbs and fingertips saw much more activity - increasing the connection between them and speeding up reaction time and sensitivity. More touchscreen use translated directly into greater brain activity when the thumbs were touched, they found. Not only are we suddenly using our fingertips and thumbs in a new way, but we do so hour after hour, day after day. The Swiss team tracked 37 volunteers over ten days - 27 of them using touchscreen phones and 11 using traditional mobile telephones with fixed buttons. Monitoring their brain waves, they found that people using the modern touchscreen phones had altered the form and function of their somatosensory cortex.

The part of the brain controlling the sense of touch in the thumbs and fingertips saw much more activity - increasing the connection between them and speeding up reaction time and sensitivity. More touchscreen use translated directly into greater brain activity when the thumbs were touched, they found. ‘We found that the common use of touchscreen phones was associated with cortical reorganisation,’ they wrote. ‘The cortical activity evoked by touch to the thumb tip was directly proportional to the amount of thumb use over the past ten days.’ Dr Ghosh said: ‘I was really surprised by the scale of the changes introduced by the use of smartphones.’ He compared the brain alteration to those seen in keen musicians. The Swiss team tracked 37 volunteers over ten days - 27 of them using touchscreen phones, and 11 using traditional mobile phones with fixed buttons. The somatosensory cortex (pictured top centre) of the brain saw much more activity - increasing the connection between fingers and speeding up reaction time and sensitivity . In violinists, for instance, the area of the brain linked to the fingers that guide the instrument is larger than in other people. But while there may be benefits - for example increased sensitivity and faster links between brain and fingers - the scientists are concerned that intense phone use may also be bad for human health. Altering the shape of the somatosensory cortex can lead to pain, spasms and movement disorders such as dystonia, they warned. The scientists said that the brain alterations are likely to be ‘maladaptive’. ‘Plasticity of the somatosensory cortex is associated with the development of chronic pain,’ they wrote in the journal article. ‘Worryingly, there is some evidence linking excessive phone use with motor dysfunctions and pain. ‘More research is still needed to unravel the consequences of the altered sensory processing linked to the use of touchscreen devices.’","People who use touchscreens daily have a larger somatosensory cortex .

With each calender year that passes, a handful of truly memorable goals are scored by some of the biggest names in sport as well as some of the lesser known talents across the globe. From Robin van Persie's gravity-defying header against Spain to Rogelio Chavez's 60-yard strike for Mexican side Cruz Azul, there were some beauties. Here, Sportsmail picks 10 of the best goals from 2014. JAMES RODRIGUEZ – COLOMBIA 2-0 Uruguay (World Cup, 28/06/14) One of the most iconic moments of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil produced by the star of the tournament. A neat, cushioned header was played to Rodriguez who was facing away from goal. The Colombian set himself, positioned his body to chest-control the ball, before turning and unleashing an unstoppable left-footed volley into the top corner of the net from 25 yards. Utterly incredible. James Rodriguez fires Colombia into a 1-0 lead against Uruguay during the 2014 World Cup . The Colombia forward was one of the standout performers during the World Cup in Brazil . ROBIN VAN PERSIE – Spain 1-5 HOLLAND (World Cup, 13/06/14) This goal gets a place in the list because it really was quite extraordinary. In terms of the context of the match, Van Persie’s header totally changed it in the favour of the Dutch – who roared back to demolish the defending champions 5-1. But the technique itself was also exquisite. A long, diagonal ball was played in behind the Spain defence and Van Persie, after just arriving in the box, arched his back and completely threw himself off the ground to lob a header over the top of Iker Casillas and into the net from 16 yards. A quite unique finish. Robin van Persie scored with this memorable header during Holland's 5-1 World Cup win against Spain . Van Persie's header pulled Holland level and sent his team on their way to a 5-1 victory . AARON RAMSEY – Galatasaray 1-4 ARSENAL (Champions League, 09/12/14) This goal produced a one of those ‘Oh my goodness – did that actually just happen?’ moments. Joel Campbell’s corner was extremely poor and was headed towards what appeared like relative safety by the Galatasaray defence. However, Ramsey caught the ball on the half-volley  and arrowed an unstoppable effort from 30 yards into the very top left-hand corner of the net. The accuracy and precision of the shot was masterful. An absolute bullet. Arsenal players celebrate Aaron Ramsey's stunning strike against Galatasaray earlier this month . ANGEL DI MARIA – Leicester City 5-3 MANCHESTER UNITED (Premier League, 21/09/14) Many people questioned the logic in Manchester United paying £60million for another attacking midfielder last summer when it was their defence they needed to focus on, but Di Maria proved his class in this one goal alone. Picking the ball up in his own half, he advanced 25 yards before passing to Wayne Rooney. After continuing his run to the edge of the box, Di Maria received a return ball from Rooney and, with two Leicester defenders closing him down, dug his foot under the ball from just inside the area and deliciously chipped Kasper Schmeichel, who was three yards off his line. Quite audacious. Angel Di Maria brings the ball  towards goal during Manchester United's clash against Leciester in September . Di Maria makes the perfect connection with the ball with his left foot with Kasper Schmeichel out of his goal . Schmeichel can only look on as the ball floats over his net and looks set to double Manchester United's lead . Di Maria scored arguably his best goal in a United shirt so far with the delightful chip against Leicester . The Argentina midfielder has scored three goals since joining United from Real Madrid in the summer . JONJO SHELVEY – SWANSEA CITY 4-1 Aston Villa (Premier League, 26/04/14) Brad Guzan will not remember this one fondly, but Shelvey certainly will. Aston Villa keeper Guzan had thrown the ball out to his defence and certainly did not expect it to be in the back of his net just moments later. Despite Villa’s deficiencies leading to this goal, nothing can be taken away from Shelvey’s strike though. After controlling the failed clearance on his chest a fully 50-yards out, the midfielder waited for the ball to bounce back up before belting a shot with the outside of his right foot that swerved and dipped into the top right-hand corner of the net. Brilliant for Shelvey, embarrassing for Villa. Jonjo Shelvey chested down a Brad Guzan clearance before volleying home from 50-yards . The midfielder wheels away in celebration of his wonder striker against Aston Villa . Villa goalkeeper Guzan had no chance of saving Shelvey's strike at the Liberty Stadium in April . MOTAZ SALHANI – Al-Ramtha 0-1 AL-WEHDAT (Jordan Premier League, 15/03/14) This goal is so unique that it is actually quite hard to describe. Salhani was running forward and was halfway into the Al-Ramtha half before a chipped through-ball was seemingly played too far behind him. The Al-Wehdat forward was not put off, however, and stuck his right leg behind his body, flicking the ball into the air and it flew over the top of the Al-Ramtha keeper and into the net from 25 yards. Was it intentional? Possibly not, but it was still exceptional. FABIAN KWOK – Albirez Niigata 4-2 GEYLANG INTERNATONAL (S.League, 08/05/14) Kwok will never, ever hit a ball more sweetly than this. There seemed to be little danger as the Albirex Niigata goalkeeper cleared the ball to Geylang International’s Kwok during this match in Singapore, but suddenly the ball was in the back of the net. With the ball still travelling at some speed in the air after the goalkeeper’s clearance, Kwok smashed a right-footed volley from inside the centre circle. It went high into the air and then dipped into the left-hand corner of the Niigata net, with the goalkeeper sent sprawling. It seems to have been just a one of those ‘swing it and see what happens' shots, but credit where it is due. AITOR ASPAS – Celta Vigo B 3-1 CORUXO FC (Segunda B, 18/01/14) All Liverpool fans will be thinking after seeing this is, if Iago Aspas’ cousin can score wondergoals like this, have the Reds bought the wrong family member? After picking the ball up in his own half, Aspas suddenly decided he was going to have a go against Celta Vigo B. He advanced past two players, then another couple, weaving in and out exquisitely, before breaking through the defence and gently chipping a shot over the advancing goalkeeper. In total, Aspas beat seven players and travelled more than 60 yards with the ball before scoring. How Liverpool fans long to see that from Iago... BLAISE MATUIDI – FRANCE 2-0 Holland (International Friendly, 05/03/14) Sometimes goals are special because they look bizarre, and this is one of those occasions. Mathieu Valbuena had attacked down the right-hand side for France against Holland before playing a chipped cross into the box. The ball was slightly behind Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Matuidi, but the Frenchman arched his body and then jumped into the air, both feet off the ground, before meeting the cross with the inside of his right foot as he feel backwards the other way. It flew into the back of the net and was a very unusual example of a bicycle kick. Certainly not your orthodox, everyday goal anyway. Blaise Matuidi connects with his unique version of a bicycle kick during a friendly against Holland . ROGELIO CHAVEZ – Queretaro 1-3 CRUZ AZUL (Liga MX, 22/02/14) This is surely the finest goal scored in Mexico in 2014. Chavez was five yards into his own half taking and throw-in and, after a Queretaro midfielder managed to win the header, it flew back towards the Cruz Azul right back. Despite being practically on the halfway line and just two yards from the side of the pitch, Chavez had spotted the Queretaro goalkeeper off his line and decided to launch both feet off the ground and smash a left-footed effort which looped high into the air, before fooling the Queretaro goalkeeper – who could not tip it over – and bouncing in via the post. Audacious, ambitious and utterly brilliant.","Sportsmail select the top 10 best goals from 2014 .

"Standing in a loose circle with hands raised, a group of around five dozen adults recite an oath to be the best adoptive parent in the world. Then, when their word is given, they scramble around the room to find their perfect baby. Meet the Cabbage Patch Kid collectors, a group of avid fans of the chubby-cheeked Eighties dolls, who assemble at Babyland General Hospital, the birthplace of Cabbage Patch Kids, to snag a limited-edition, hand-stitched newborn. Babyland General Hospital in Cleveland, Georgia, has been the home of Cabbage Patch Kids since 1978 when Xavier Roberts, a young artist from the area, created the fabric dolls that went on to become a worldwide phenomenon. Nestled in the foothills of the north Georgia mountains, Babyland General Hospital looks like a nice Southern-style home and offers tours as well as all kinds of 'babies' for 'adoption' to the super fans. Babyland General Hospital in Cleveland, Georgia, has been the home of Cabbage Patch Kids since 1978 when Xavier Roberts, a young artist from the area, created the fabric dolls that went on to become a worldwide phenomenon . Cyndi Pappadouplos (left) and Nancy Smith (right) are both 'licensed patch nurses' who work at the hospital where collectors flock to 'adopt' the dolls . Inside the hospital the patch nurses assists with the delivery of Cabbage Patch Kids beneath the Magic Crystal Tree . But this is not your average toy factory. Inside, Mother Cabbage sits at the base of a Magic Crystal Tree waiting to receive visitors, most of whom are adults who have travelled for hours, if not days, to meet her and hopefully take home a squidgy new addition to their family. When the crystals at the base of the tree begin to glow and an announcement comes over the loudspeaker that Mother Cabbage is dilated, visitors gather to watch a baby being delivered. A nurse gives Mother Cabbage a small dose of 'Imagicillin' to help loosen her leaves and a large dose of tender loving care, or TLC, and then leads onlookers in breathing exercises before pulling a naked doll from the leaves. The Babyland General Hospital website describes the visitor experience: 'Mother Cabbage is always on display beneath the branches of the Magic Crystal Tree. Pollinated by fanciful Bunnybees®, our magical Cabbage Patch is tended by our Licensed Patch Doctors and Nurses. 'Babyland General Hospital is the only place in the world where you can witness the birth of a hand-sculpted Cabbage Patch Kid. With thousands of Cabbage Patch Kids throughout the hospital, you are sure to find your perfect match. Take the Oath of Adoption and your new baby will give you unconditional love.' Instead of buying the dolls, shoppers pay for an adoption certificate as well as reciting an oath to be the best adoptive parent in the world . Newer hand-stitched babies start at about $225, but older ones such as these three original Eighties dolls held by Dianne Adcock from circa 1980,  can sell for tens of thousands of dollars . Admission to the hospital is free and 'babies' are born throughout the year, but the company also organises extra special collectors events. At the recent limited edition Appalachian Christmas collection some people had trouble choosing. 'I have to like the face,' collector Wilma Arrington said. 'That's the first thing I look at.' 'And the hairstyle,' her husband, John, added. 'The hair and the outfit, it has to go together,' his wife agreed. For others, it's a bit more abstract. 'It's the personality and the look of the baby because we come in here, and some draw us to them and some don't,' said Eileen Cancilla, another collector. 'It's the baby that picks us out.' On this particular day, six called out to Cancilla and her husband, Bob, who travelled from northern California. At home, they have a collection of about 2,500. Admission to the hospital is free and 'babies' are born throughout the year, but the company also organises extra special collectors events . Eileen Cancilla from California is  one of the hundreds of fans who attended the 'birth' of the recent Appalachian Christmas collection at the hospital. 'It's the baby that picks us out,' she explains . Each collector has particular reason for their choice of Cabbage Patch Kid . And while everyone is clearly focused on getting the baby they want, there's no pushing or shoving or fighting over individual babies — unlike in 1983 when production was overwhelmed by demand for the mass-produced version of the soft dolls and fights over the toys broke out. 'Everybody respects everybody else,' said Rebecca Wagner. 'When one person sees a baby they like, then the other person will back away.' Wagner has passed her love of Cabbage Patch Kids on to her 24-year-old daughter, Victoria, and the two have more than a thousand dolls. They make the trip from Cleveland, Ohio, to Babyland General several times a year. Collectors sometimes have a hard time explaining their passion to friends. Bob Cancilla endured a bit of teasing about his hobby before retiring several years ago from his job as a sheriff's lieutenant. 'They used to laugh until they found out how the value is of the older babies,' he said with a chuckle. Emily Brown, of Cornelia, Ga., takes photos to send to a friend of Cabbage Patch Kids she's considering adopting. Some of the dolls are available on a payment plan as they are so expensive .

Marcia Dewey, centre, and husband Jim, right, both of Lake Zurich, Ill., compare Cabbage Patch Kids with Roger Moore, left, of Edmond, Oklahma . Newer hand-stitched babies start at about $225 (about £144), but dolls dating to before the mass-market frenzy can sell for tens of thousands of dollars. During their trip for the most recent collectors' event in November, the Cancillas also picked up Bartholomew, a baby from 1978 that they'd paid for using 'Time Adopt,' a payment plan for more expensive dolls. But what keeps these collectors making several trips a year to Babyland General is the tight friendships they've formed with other collectors who share their passion. The Arringtons, who also used to travel from Ohio for the seasonal collector events, now live an hour away. 'The main reason we moved here is because of Babyland,' John Arrington said. And while they love all the babies in their collections, each collector has a favorite. For Victoria Wagner, it's a Blackberry Winter edition  from 1980 hand-signed by Cabbage Patch Kid creator Xavier Roberts that she adopted over the summer. 'He's my oldest one and he is so tiny,' she said. 'That's my pride and joy right there.'","Babyland General Hospital is the birthplace of Cabbage Patch Kids .

"A singer performed a sick version of the song Bad, Bad Leroy Brown with the lyrics rewritten to mock the shooting teenager Michael Brown in front of a room full of cops. Gary Fishell played a mocking version of the Jim Croce song, giving it a new chorus referring to 'Dead, dead Michael Brown'. The new lyrics, aired at an Elks Lodge in Glendale, California, relived the shooting and said the dead brown 'looked like some old Swiss cheese' and had 'his brain... splattered on the floor' in video obtained by TMZ. Scroll down for video . Mocking: The song made fun of the police shooting of teenage Michael Brown, and called his killer a 'badass' Audience: Half of the 50-60 people attending the California party were serving or retired police . Cop party: Gary Fishell performed the parodic version of the Jim Croce song Bad, Bad Leroy Brown at the Elks Lodge building in Glendale, California, above . Shot dead: The song mocked slain teen Michael brown . Fishell compared Brown to a 'roadkill dog' in the song, while praising Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson as a 'badass'. An outraged attendee at the party filmed part of the song when they realized nobody was objected to the new, racist lyrics. Sources told TMZ around 30 retired and serving cops were at the party, thrown by retired LAPD officer Joe Myers. Lawyers for Fishell have tried to pass off the performance as a joke, defending their client as a 'goofball who writes funny songs'. One said: 'He thought the room would get a kick out of it'. They said in hindsight he acknowledges the song was 'in poor taste'. Myers defended Fishell's right to mock the dead teen, telling the site: 'This is America. We can say what we want. This is a free America.' He also pointed out he wasn't in charge of Fishell's set list. An Elks Lodge spokesman said the event was nothing to do with them - and both Fishell and Myers could be punished. He said: 'it's deplorable and inappropriate and the Lodge will take disciplinary action against [Fishell] and possibly the people who organized this event.' Funny? Fishell made fun of Brown's death in Ferguson this summer, which fired racial tensions across America. The song describes the scene, above, when Brown lay dead in front of officer Darren Wilson .

"Alan Pardew gave his Newcastle players a day to rid themselves of their derby despair and has banned talk of their fourth straight Tyne-Wear loss. The Magpies were told to stay away from the training ground on Monday as they recovered from the 1-0 reverse 24 hours earlier, inflicted when Adam Johnson struck in the last minute.

"Chelsea's midfield enforcer Nemanja Matic believes Jose Mourinho’s team can win an unprecedented four trophies this season. The Serbia international was on top form as Chelsea brushed aside Stoke to win 2-0 at the Britannia Stadium and stay top of the Barclays Premier League on Monday night.

"Investors burned by Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme could be getting back more of their money. The trustee in charge of recovering funds for Madoff's victims said Monday he is asking a New York bankruptcy court for permission to distribute another $322 million. This as 55% of the billions lost by Madoff has now been recovered. Scroll down for video . Payback: Bernie Madoff's trustee is set to return another $322million to duped investors as 55% of the $20billion lost by disgraced money man has now been recovered . Trustee Irving Picard said that if approved, the latest payment would bring the total distributed so far to Madoff investors to $7.2 billion. Madoff's multi-decade fraud lost about $20 billion from thousands of investors. His firm told clients they were gaining steady returns when in fact Madoff was using money from new investors to distribute funds to existing clients while financing a lavish lifestyle for him. Picard, appointed after Madoff's scheme collapsed in 2008, has recovered about $10.5 billion. A hearing is scheduled for January on whether to approve the latest distribution, which would send payments to about 1,000 Madoff investors. The smallest proposed payout is $391, the largest, almost $61 million. The process for returning the recovered funds has been arduous, with victims filing lawsuits and other complaints over how Picard has chosen to distribute the money. Madoff, 76, pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges in March 2009 and is serving a 150-year prison sentence. Going away: Annette Bongiorno, who worked for Madoff from the 1960s until the firm's collapse in 2008, was the second of five former employees to be sentenced after being convicted in March of securities fraud . This comes just two weeks after a former manager at Bernard Madoff's firm was sentenced to six years in prison today in New York for helping the convicted fraudster carry out a Ponzi scheme that caused investors to lose billions of dollars.

"They are all icons of the Stretford End, adored for their wonderful goals, committed performances and all-round class. And now, Manchester United's famous No 7s past and present have been immortalised as unique works of art. George Best, Bryan Robson, Eric Cantona, David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo and Angel di Maria have all been depicted in stylish prints commissioned by the Bleacher Report. George Best, the original Manchester United No 7, is shown in his sixties pomp on this artwork . Best, the original No 7 poster boy who helped United to glory both at home and in Europe, is shown by artist Zoran Lucic in his sixties pomp, his name presented boldly to reflect the impact he had both on the pitch and off it as football's first celebrity. The Northern Irishman guided United to the First Division championship in 1965 and 1967, though his crowning glory undoubtedly came when United beat Benfica 4-1 at Wembley to lift the European Cup in 1968. Voted the world's best footballer in that same year, Best continues to be regarded by those fortunate enough to see him as one of the finest players ever. Best showed off his ball skills in front of the photographers at Old Trafford . Brendan Higgins channels the esteem in which 'Captain Marvel' Robson was held by United's fans in his artwork. He shows Robson carried shoulder high by the fans who stormed the Old Trafford pitch following United's famous 3-0 win over Barcelona in the European Cup-Winners' Cup in 1984. The former England captain made a total of 461 appearances for the club, helping them to two Premier League titles, three FA Cups, the League Cup and the Cup-Winners' Cup in 1991. Robson inspired United to a 3-0 win over Barcelona in the 1984 European Cup Winners' Cup . 'King' Cantona was rarely out of the headlines and that is celebrated by artist Richard Debenham, who has mocked up a newspaper front page for his tribute. A flawed genius, Frenchman Cantona inspired United to four Premier League titles in the Nineties as well as two FA Cup wins in 1994 and 1996, scoring in both finals. Voted the club's greatest-ever player in a survey by Inside United magazine, few who saw him at his best would argue. Eric Cantona was rarely out of the headlines and that is celebrated in this artwork . Cantona scores in United's 4-0 Champions League quarter-final win over Porto in 1997 . Beckham is shown by Steve Welsh in a familiar pose - carrying a trophy. In this case, it's the FA Cup in 1999, the second leg of United's unprecedented Treble triumph. One of the best midfield players and free-kick takers ever, Beckham enjoyed a glittering career at Old Trafford, winning six league titles, two FA Cups and the Champions League in 1999. In all, he scored 85 times in 394 matches for United and also captained England, winning 115 caps in total for his country. Beckham celebrates after scoring from the half-way line against Wimbledon in August 1996 . Dan Leydon shows Cristiano Ronaldo's cheeky grin, no doubt after bamboozling another opponent. Undoubtedly the best player in the world now, Ronaldo's career really took at United, where he won three Premier League crowns, the FA Cup, two League Cups and the Champions League in 2008. The Portuguese scored 118 goals in 292 matches for the club and is still celebrated with 'Viva Ronaldo' chants at Old Trafford now. Ronaldo kisses the European Cup after United beat Chelsea on penalties to win the trophy in 2008 . Brining the No 7 collection bang up to date is Sebastian Domenech, who shows the latest player to continue the tradition - Di Maria. The Argentina superstar is shown performing his familiar heart celebration as he marks one of his early goals for the club. Brought in by Louis van Gaal for a British record £60m in the summmer, Di Maria certainly has all those match-winning qualities expected of a United No 7. And linking past with present is Charis Tsevis, who brings all six portraits together in one - very red - montage.

"Just a couple of days after playing as an emergency striker against Crystal Palace, James Milner has proved his versatility as an actor by starring in Manchester City's latest Christmas video. Inspired by the popular parody Twitter account @BoringMilner, which portrays the England midfielder as football's dullest player, the new clip sees the 28-year-old welcome kit man Les Chapman into his 'home' for Christmas. Set in a meeting room at City's new Football Academy, Milner is filmed opening presents from his family - all of which are wrapped in plain brown paper as he 'doesn't like too much colour'. James Milner is disappointed with his 'foreign' PG Tips tea bags as he was hoping for Yorkshire Tea . The Manchester City midfielder shows off a card from his former team-mate Gareth Barry . Milner talks about his 'amazing day' with the Queen and Prince Charles in City's Christmas video . Reading a book entitled 'Avoid Boring People' when he hears a knock on the door, Milner's other reading material includes literature on Greek sculpture and calorie counting. But having sent a Christmas list to his family - all of whom share similar names - Milner is soon settling down alongside City's popular kit man Chappy to open his gifts. First up is a box of PG Tips tea bags from his uncle James, although Yorkshireman Milner is left perplexed by the brand. 'Bit foreign isn't it?' he says. 'Thought it was only Yorkshire Tea that did tea bags. I've never heard of them.' Milner then shows off a plain white Christmas card - with the words 'Merry Christmas' in black font on the front - from his former team-mate Gareth Barry. 'He's a good mate,' Milner says of the Everton midfielder. 'He's a hoot - we have some great text conversations. It's brilliant. Snow white.' Milner opens Christmas presents alongside Manchester City kit man  Les Chapman . Milner reads a book entitled 'Avoid Boring People' before Chapman arrives to open his presents . Next up is a set of dumpling moulds from Auntie Jay. 'That wasn't on my list but me and Auntie Jay had a detailed conversation a few weeks ago about dumplings and how it's so hard to get them spherical,' Milner explains. Continuing to live up to the @BoringMilner account, which has over 360,000 followers, Milner shows off a mocked-up picture of him with the Queen and Prince Charles, declaring: 'It was an amazing day. As you can see everyone was having a whale of a time. It was one of the funniest days I've had.' An eraser, pencil  and sharpener from his Auntie James then appear to make Milner's day as the former Leeds midfielder excitedly says: 'That's going to come in handy. They get a bit giddy with pink ones these days but you can't beat a white rubber. Pencil sharpener - marvellous.' 'Ooh, shall I try it out? It's going through nice and smooth - sometimes you can get those jittery ones. It's come out beautiful.' But Milner is left confused when he opens five pairs of feel fresh socks from his auntie Milly, all of which are emblazoned with the days of the week. 'What about Saturday and Sunday?' he says. 'It does throw me off. I really enjoyed wearing them [last year]. Milner tests out his new pencil sharpener and is impressed with the 'beautiful' shavings produced . Ex-Aston Villa star Milner displays his new nine-inch shovel which he'll use to clear leaves outside his house . 'But when I was taking my washing up and down the stairs I dropped one and it wasn't clean in time. I had to wear one Tuesday and one Wednesday. It was a day we were travelling to Europe and I nearly fell down the stairs on to the plane because my right foot was moving quicker than my left. I might be running around in circles if I'm wearing different socks.' Fortunately Milner's special day ended on a high when he received a new shovel from his Uncle Jimbo. 'Marvellous,' he says after unwrapping his final present. 'That is fantastic. I've been waiting for this one. 'I didn't want to use last year's shovel - it doesn't feel right. I can't wait. It's a nine-inch one as well which isn't too big but you can use it with one hand. Perfect.' The England man proves he has a kind heart too by handing over a gift to former City midfielder Chapman - a handheld steam cleaner. 'It's my old one but I've kept it pristine,' Milner adds.

"Chelsea captain John Terry once again got his name on the scoresheet at Stoke, but despite notching for the 15th consecutive campaign, the former England captain is second behind David Unsworth in the list of the top goalscoring Premier League defenders. Terry showed great body strength and power to hold off his marker Geoff Cameron to put Chelsea on their way to their 13th win of the season at the Britannia Stadium on Monday night. Throughout his time at Stamford Bridge, the Blues stalwart has netted some crucial strikes, with a total of 35 league goals an impressive tally for a defender. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jose Mourinho: John Terry is as good today as he was in 2004 . John Terry celebrates a vital header at Stoke on Monday night, which set Chelsea on their way to victory . Unsworth's most crucial penalty kept Wigan in the Premier League on a dramatic final day in 2007 . However, thanks to his penalty-taking prowess, the much-traveled Unsworth has three more strikes to his name and can still claim to be the Premier League's top goalscoring defender. The most crucial of these goals came on a wet and windy day in South Yorkshire, as a thunderous spot kick sealed a dramatic final day victory over Sheffield United that ensured his Wigan side stayed in the top flight for another season. The majority of Unsworth's goals came during two stints at Everton, with the robust centre back famously rejoining the Toffees a matter of hours after moving to Aston Villa from West Ham. Unsworth celebrates a converted spot kick for Portsmouth in 2004 (left), and after scoring for Everton in 1999 . Terry helped his side at both ends of the pitch to help Chelsea seal their first Premier League crown in 2005 . Free-kick specialist Ian Harte lies seven behind Terry, but in the twilight of his career at Bournemouth, he is unlikely to catch the Chelsea veteran. Everton's penalty taker Leighton Baines is a real threat to Terry with 26 goals to his name, while former Arsenal and Chelsea defender William Gallas completes the top five, and is the second highest scorer from open play. David Unsworth - 38 . John Terry - 35 . Ian Harte - 28 . Leighton Baines - 26 . William Gallas - 25 . Terry himself has scored several crucial goals for Chelsea throughout his career, and played a major role in several title challenges in the opposition's penalty area. An equaliser against Arsenal, the then reigning champions, at Highbury in 2004 was certainly vital in helping Chelsea secure their first top flight title in 50 years. Even more pivotal, Terry's late winner against title rivals Manchester United at Stamford Bridge in 2010 earned the Blues a last-gasp victory as the title race went down to the wire. And after admitting there is still life in his weary limbs yet, Terry has time to overtake Unsworth, and write himself yet further into Chelsea and Premier League folklore.","John Terry has now found the net in 15 consecutive seasons .

"When the story of 'baby gammy' broke in August it sent shockwaves through the Thai surrogacy industry and shed new light on the growing use of imported surrogacy by many Australian couples. Thai surrogacy was growing rapidly and the increase in Thai women having surrogate babies attracted the interest of a Bangkok TV station, where one journalist found out just how easy it was to have a surrogate baby. A woman on the phone, nicknamed Goy, told the journalist she was a surrogate mother herself and that she had a down syndrome baby that had been abandoned by his Australian parents. This information created a world media storm that came to Thailand to expose the 'baby gammy' story as well as exposing his Australian parents, the Farnells. SCROLL DOWN TO VIDEO . David Markovic was left with two babies in bangkok, Liam and Joe, because he was unable to get them back to Australia due to the crackdown on surrogacy in Thailand. The industry had a spotlight shined on it following the controversial 'Baby Gammy' case . Eight week old babies Liam and Joe (pictured) The babies were born to a Thai surrogate mother and their Australian parents had trouble bringing them home due to a crackdown by the Thailand government . But in doing so, the widely televised case, changed everything for Thai surrogacy and created a tyrade of problems for Australian couples who were desperate for a child. 'It's shed a light on this practice that many people were unaware of. Australia is a major source country for intending parents in surrogacy,' Dr. Anne Gallagher, an international human right lawyer told ABC's Four Corners. 'For better or worse international law and Australian law doesn't give us a right to be a parent, we need to start looking at the other parties involved in this, the child and look at the best interests of the child and the surrogate and perhaps we should be asking questions about justice and ethics and morality,' she said. The exposure of Baby Gammy saw the crackdown of surrogate babies in Thailand and it lead the government to stop a number of Aussie couples who were trying to bring back a child. David Markovic was one of them. After years of unsuccessful IVF, David and his wife Lorraine were told they were too old to adopt, and their last resort was paid surrogacy in Thailand. Finally after more than a decade, the couple finally had two beautiful babies they so desperately wanted. 'We're just over the moon we're just entirely in love and my wife is waiting as patiently as she can in Perth for their return as soon as possible,' David told Four Corners. Baby gammy and his surrogate mother 'Goy'. After the story broke of 'Baby Gammy' it shed a light on the Thai surrogate industry and left a number of Australia couples, desperate for a baby, in limbo . Lorraine and David Markovic (pictured with babies Liam and Joe). The couple had a long wait to get the babies back to Perth due to a crackdown on Thai surrogacy. The couple were desperate to have a baby and have no other choice than to turn to Thai surrogacy . But since the Baby Gammy story broke their effort to bring home eight week old twins Liam and Joe was hampered. While Lorraine travelled back to Australia to go back to work, the 52 year old lawyer from Perth, was left with the two babies and spent five weeks in Bangkok in a bid to fight to bring them to their new home. His brother in Law, Brendan from England flew in to lend a hand as the two men struggled to get the right documentation to get them back to Australia. 'If I don't return to Australia, we may lose our house,' David told Four Corners. 'I've had less than a handful of hours sleep in the last few days .' He went to court to try to get them to agree to let them fly back to Australia with the babies but that case was adjourned. The only other option was to fly out with the baby's birth mother, but before they could, they needed all the documentation. That took a couple of painstaking days before finally the men could return to Australia and the couple were reunited together and were able to live a normal life with their two new babies. Luckily for gay couple James and Danny Carrington they were able to leave Thailand with twins Elijah and Hannah who were born in Bangkok in May. They were one of the last to leave Thailand before a number of Australian couples involved in surrogacy were stopped and told they couldn't leave the country. 'I think we both cried I don't think we were allowed to hold them for 24 hours and when we went back to the nursery the next day we were actually allowed to hold them and feed them,' James told Four Corners. 'There were people from america, Canada, people from China, Israel, Taiwan and it was quite amazing, we're talking eight or nine Australian surrogate children a day going through the embassy.' David Markovic's brother in law Brendan from England came out to help with the two twins, Liam and Joe, after Lorraine had to leave to go back to work in Australia. The trouble started after the 'Baby Gammy' case was exposed . Lorraine with one of the two babies they had via Thai surrogacy. The story also exposed the unfair deal most Thai surrogate mothers are receiving through agencies that pocket most of the money. 'If intending parents actually develop contact with the surrogate they will become aware perhaps of the terms of her contract,' said Dr Anne Gallagher. 'It's very difficult to argue that commercial surrogacy is the not sale of children and Australia has an international legal obligation and in fact to prevent the sale of children,' she said. Thai Surrogacy agent Joy told Four Corners she was traumatised by the baby gammy case and quit the business because of it. 'This journey is not easy. It is not like any other business in the world. I couldn't even call it a business because it's a lot of emotion, it's not only about money,' she said. In Australia commercial surrogacy is banned and unregulated in the Northern Territory. But chief judge John Pascoe believes commercial surrogacy should be allowed in the country, regulated in Australia and banned in other overseas countries. 'If commercial surrogacy is allowed with proper regulation in Australia to protect the rights of all parties then we simply have a law that prevents a law of surrogacy children being brought back to Australia,' he told Four Corners. David Markovic also believes Australia needs a proper national enquiry, that looks at all aspects of surrogacy.

"Most Arsenal fans couldn't quite believe the news that Arsene Wenger reportedly turned down a move for Cesc Fabregas ahead of the Spaniard's switch to rivals Chelsea last summer. When asked if Fabregas’s first choice was a return to Arsenal, Wenger replied: ‘Certainly, yes. But when he left we bought Mesut Ozil. We have Santi Cazorla, Jack Wilshere and we were not in the need to buy offensive players.' What makes things worse for the Gunners faithful is just how well Fabregas has been doing in a blue shirt, already bagging 12 Premier League assists and two goals in just 16 appearances. Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas now has 12 assists in just 16 Premier League games this season . Jose Mourinho (centre) embraces Fabregas after Chelsea's 2-0 win against Stoke on Monday night . The Spaniard celebrates scoring his first Premier League goal for Chelsea against Crystal Palace in October . If that wasn't enough, the midfielder's pinpoint corner to set up a John Terry header against Stoke on Monday night meant Fabregas now has more Premier League assists than former team-mate Wilshere has earned in his entire career with Arsenal. Wilshere, who admittedly has been forced to miss large chunks of his Gunners career through injury, has recorded just 11 Premier League assists in 95 showings in an Arsenal shirt. The 22-year-old made nine Premier League appearances this season before being ruled out for three months at the end of November after undergoing surgery on damaged ligaments in his left ankle. Jack Wilshere has recorded just 11 assists in 95 Premier League appearances for Arsenal . Wilshere posted this picture on his Instagram account showing his recovery work in the gym . During those nine games, Wilshere scored once and picked up one assist while Fabregas had already laid on eight goals for his Stamford Bridge team-mates. Febregas, who scored Chelsea's crucial second goal in the 2-0 win against Stoke on Monday night, has been one of the key ingredients to the form of Jose Mourinho's side so far this term. Speaking recently after Chelsea's 3-1 Capital One Cup win against Derby, Mourinho was full of praise for his summer signing. 'Cesc Fabregas is playing so well for us. What I like is as a person he is a professional,' he said. 'He is a world champion, he comes here to play in the Capital One Cup and plays like that. That is the character I like.'

"Arsene Wenger predicts an exciting new year when Arsenal’s injured stars return to full fitness. Mesut Ozil is expected back in January and Theo Walcott is almost ready to start after nearly 12 months out with a knee injury. Mikel Arteta has suffered a slight setback with an ankle problem as he recovered from a calf strain but Arsenal boss Wenger is optimistic about the near future.

Mesut Ozil and Aaron Ramsey, sidelined through injury, should be back in action for Arsenal in the New Year . Olivier Giroud blows a kiss to the camera after scoring Arsenal's second goal against Liverpool at Anfield . 'To give everything in every game until end of the season,' said Wenger, when asked what he wanted from the festive games; his side host Queens Park Rangers on Boxing Day before travelling to West Ham. They then face Southampton on New Year's Day at the Emirates Stadium. 'I believe with injuries back we will have much stronger squad and 2015 can be very exciting if we get injured players back and have a good run. 'To finish in the top four is always the minimum required but we have Champions League, FA Cup and the Premier League where we want to come back to a stronger position and I think we will.' Arsenal are sixth in table, 15 points adrift of Chelsea, after they drew 2-2 at Liverpool on Sunday. The Gunners looked set to take all three points from Anfield but were held when Martin Skrtel equalised in the seventh minute of injury-time. Theo Walcott, in training for Arsenal last week, hasn't started a game for the Gunners in almost 12 months . Mikel Arteta's season has been plagued by injuries. He is currently sidelined with an ankle issue . 'The mood after Liverpool was one of disappointment because we conceded a goal in the last minute,' said Wenger. 'You can concede on corners at any minute. We were not quickly enough organised but the results was a fair result and not a disaster.' Vice-captain Per Mertesacker came under intense scrutiny after he appeared to dodge Skrtel's winning header in front of the Kop. I don’t want to do into individual assessment,' said Wenger when asked about the German World Cup winner. Olivier Giroud and his Arsenal pals attend a Christmas dinner ahead of their Boxing Day clash against QPR . 'Mertesacker gives his best and on the corner but it is more organisational and collective problem because nobody really talks. We work on it. Usually we’re not bad on set-pieces, one of the best records in the league.' Ozil and Arteta are on target for January comebacks from knee and calf injuries and although Ramsey and Koscielny may miss the Boxing Day showdown with hamstring and calf problems, they could both be in action against Southampton on New Year's Day. 'Ozil will be back at the beginning of January. His rehab has gone well but it took time. He works very hard. He is very focused. Fitness-wise, he is there,' Wenger added. 'Arteta is progressing well. He had a little setback with an ankle problem but it should be very quick now. He will not play before January. 'Ramsey has a chance to be fit for Southampton. The closest at the moment is Koscielny. I believe he's a bit short for QPR, maybe has a chance for West Ham on Sunday.'","Arsenal sit 6th in Premier League table, 16 points behind leaders Chelsea .

"Spain dominated the club game in Europe and all over the planet in 2014, with Real Madrid lifting the European Cup and the World Club Cup. The capital truly was the centre of Spanish football, with Diego Simeone leading Atletico Madrid to an unlikely La Liga title. And to make it better for Madristas, Barcelona did not win a thing. There were also two blokes called Ronaldo and Messi. They weren't bad either. Here's Sportsmail's A-Z of Spanish football in 2014. A for Atletico . Diego Simeone’s team became the first since Rafa Benitez’s Valencia in 2004 to break the big-two’s stranglehold on La Liga when they won it in May thanks to Diego Costa’s goals, Thibaut Courtois’ saves, some Crazy-Gang spirit, and the brooding boss who made them believe. Diego Simeone (centre) is thrown into the air by his players after leading Atletico Madrid to the La Liga title . B for Bale v Bartra . There were six minutes left of the Copa del Rey final in April and extra-time beckoned with Real Madrid 1-1 against Barcelona. Gareth Bale was on the halfway line when he started his race with Marc Bartra, he ran off the pitch and back on it and still out-sprinted the defender to score the winner. C for Court . Barcelona spent too much time there in 2014. They were taken to court by one of their own supporters over the Neymar transfer; and then went to the court of arbitration (CAS) over Fifa banning them from making transfers. Leo Messi went to court over tax evasion, and Luis Suarez also went to CAS to appeal a ban on him training with his new Barça team-mates. D for La Decima . You may have heard Madrid supporters mention this once or twice. The tenth European Cup was finally won in Lisbon in May after 12 years of trying. They spent a billion and sacked 10 managers along the way but they got there with a 4-1 win over Atletico Madrid.

The first man Carlo Ancelotti embraced on the touchline at the final whistle was his No 2 Paul Clement. Becoming a No 1 somewhere will be the Londoner’s next step. F is for El Fideo . Nicknamed ‘The Noodle’, Angel Di Maria began the year losing his place to Bale at Real Madrid but he ended up playing alongside Bale, scoring in the Spanish Cup final, winning Man of the Match in the Champions League final and moving to Manchester United. G is for Diego Godin . The rock at the heart of  defence scored the goal that won the league for Atletico at the Nou Camp on the last day of the season. H is for hoops . After 115 years of wearing stripes Barcelona revealed in December that they will wear hoops next season. The fans say it’s sacrilegious; the kit-makers say it’a lucrative – both are probably right. I is for Iker . After a terrible World Cup Real Madrid’s legendary goalkeeper looked all washed up. But he’s back to his best and in November told Sportsmail: 'I want to play until I’m 40'. Iker Casillas (centre) holds the Club World Cup aloft following Real Madrid's win against San Lorenzo . J is for Jack Harper . Outstanding for Real in the UEFA Youth League the 18-year-old Scot is destined for big things both for club and country. K is for Kroos . Not often Bayern Munich make a mistake in the transfer market. At €30million Toni Kroos looks the signing of the year. L is for Liverpool legends . Kenny Dalglish flew to Barcelona in October to present another great former Liverpool No 7 Luis Suarez with the Golden Shoe. Suarez wanted the presentation to take place at Anfield but schedules did not allow. ‘Come any time, and bring your boots’ says Brendan Rodgers.

That is what Real Sociedad hope to be able to say in the coming years as David Moyes works his magic at their Zubieta youth academy. He took over in November. N is for Neymar . He has already topped the nine league goals he scored in his first season. And he’s kept himself busy off the pitch, flying model Soraja Vucelic into Barcelona in October. O is for odd signings . Barcelona needed to rebuild their defence this summer. They signed Sao Paolo right back Douglas for £4.4m and Thomas Vermaelen for £15m. They have started one league game between them. Thomas Vermaelen has been hit by a string of injuries since signing for Barcelona in the summer . P is for promoted . Eibar won promotion to the top flight in May for the first time in their 75-year history – great news for the 5,000 fans that cram into their stadium and for the 130 who watch from the tower blocks overlooking the ground. Q is for quit . Barcelona president Sandro Rosell walked away in January. He had managed to upset Pep Guardiola, Johan Cruyff, Lionel Messi, the Spanish tax man, and FIFA during his three and a half year reign . R is for Ramos . Real were seconds from losing the European Cup in May when Sergio Ramos headed in the equalizer. At 28, he has already played over 300 Madrid games. Legend. Sergio Ramos' header hauled Madrid back into the Champions League final, which they ended up winning . S is for seventeen . Some say Cristiano Ronaldo only scores so many goals because of weak La Liga defences. That will be why he only scored 17 in last season’s Champions League then. T is for ‘Ta-ta Tata Martinez’ He chewed gum through press conferences, organised a mid-season barbecue to boost team-spirit, won nothing, and was gone by June. U for Unai . Sevilla coach Unai Emery led his team to Europa League glory in May. His reward? The same as every other year – his best players were sold. Unai Emery won the Europa League with Sevilla in may but his best players left the club soon after . V is for Varane . Do you really want to be kicking the ball straight at Simeone when the Argentine has just let the European Cup slip? Simeone stormed on to the pitch to confront Raphael Varane and earned an eight-match ban. W for waterworks . Sevilla full back Alberto Moreno was in floods of tears as he said goodbye to his team-mates in Spain in August. Some said it was because he was joining Liverpool. X for Xavi and Xabi . Spain’s X-men retired from international football in August having won the lot. Xavi (left) and Xabi Alonso (right) both retired from international duty with Spain this year . Y is for yoga fan . Carles Puyol retired last May having lifted every in trophy imaginable. He has plenty more time now to lift girlfriend Vanesa Lorenzo as the pair practise Acro-Yoga together. Z for Zarra Telmo .

"Benoit Assou-Ekotto is being paid £40,000 a week by Tottenham despite not playing for the first team for more than 18 months. The defender does not even train with the first-team squad these days as he prepares for a move in the January transfer window. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino excluded Assou-Ekotto from his first-team squad when he arrived at the club and doesn’t want him anywhere near his group. Benoit Assou-Ekotto has been told he can leave Tottenham after being excluded from the first team . Instead the left-back, who spent last season on loan at Queens Park Rangers in the Championship, has a separate training schedule and has been allocated a fitness coach. Assou-Ekotto has had a chequered career in English football and has fallen out with a number of Spurs managers since his arrival from Lens in 2006 for a reported £3.5million. He has a particularly difficult relationship with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy and the pair have rarely agreed on various matter since his move to White Hart Lane. The Cameroon international, 30, who caused further frustration at the end of the summer transfer window when he turned down a number of loan moves to Championship clubs, has also made it clear on a number of occasions that he plays football simply for money and regards it as simply a job. The 30-year-old spent last season on loan in the Championship with QPR (left) and in happier times for Tottenham when he was a regular at left back (right) In an interview in The Guardian in 2010 he said: ‘It’s only a job. Yes, it’s a good, good job and I don’t say that I hate football but it’s not my passion. ‘I don’t understand why everybody lies. The president of my former club Lens, Gervais Martel, said I left because I got more money in England, that I didn’t care about the shirt. I said: “Is there one player in the world who signs for a club and says, Oh, I love your shirt?” Your shirt is red. I love it. He doesn’t care. The first thing that you speak about is the money. ‘Martel said I go to England for the money but why do players come to his club? Because they look nice? All people, everyone, when they go to a job, it’s for the money. Assou-Ekotto was banned for three games after praising Nicolas Anelka (above) for his 'quenelle' gesture . 'So I don’t understand why, when I said I play for the money, people were shocked. Oh, he’s a mercenary. Every player is like that.’ He fell out with Tottenham earlier this year after it emerged that he had invited anti-Semitic comedian Dieudonne M’bala M’bala to a game at Tottenham, insisting he would ‘love it’. In a tweet that was subsequently deleted, Assou-Ekotto, then on loan at QPR, messaged the man who invented the controversial quenelle gesture used by Nicolas Anelka to celebrate a goal for West Brom. Spurs bosses have made it perfectly clear that the defender is free to leave and can join the first club who are prepared to meet his wage demands.","Benoit Assou-Ekotto's last Tottenham appearance came on May 19 2013 against Sunderland at White Hart Lane .

"The wintry Monday night at Stoke is a cliche, but it was a crucial test in Chelsea’s title crusade. With Manchester City level on points, any slip-up would have put Jose Mourinho’s men on the back foot throughout the festive period. Step up, yet again, John Terry. The Blues captain scored his 60th goal – and 44th header – for the club inside the first two minutes at the Britannia Stadium to set the tone for the game. The 2-0 win was reminiscent of a turning point in Chelsea’s first title-winning season under Mourinho, a 1-0 triumph at Blackburn in 2005. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jose Mourinho: John Terry is as good today as he was in 2004 . John Terry scored his 60th goal for Chelsea during the 2-0 win against Stoke on Monday night . The Blues captain rises about the Stoke defence to head Chelsea into a 1-0 lead at the Britannia Stadium . Both tricky, spiky midweek matches against teams managed by Mark Hughes, Chelsea gave as good as they got to emerge with three points and a renewed belief that the Premier League title was theirs for the taking. At the heart of defence for both wins, near-on 10 years apart, was Terry. His manager believes he is now as good as he ever was. After the match, Mourinho said: ‘When he is on the pitch he is always a threat. But more important for me than the goal is the way he is playing this season, again. Terry has been at the heart of the Chelsea defence for well over a decade . Terry brings his team-mates together to celebrate a 2-1 win against Liverpool in November . The 34-year-old thanks fans after making his 500th appearance as Chelsea captain in October . ‘When I came here (in the summer of 2013) he was a bit in trouble, his career was a bit up and down and he was not playing regularly for Chelsea. ‘But he has played basically every game, and, for me, at the same level as from 2004-2007 when I was here.’ Terry has changed vastly as a player since then - in fact, it could be said he is even better. Next to Ricardo Carvalho or William Gallas, he was the last-ditch man, throwing his body in the way of shots and attackers alike. With Gary Cahill now fulfilling that role, Terry is the calmer, far more composed of Chelsea’s centre-half pairing. His impeccable reading of the game means he now steps up and intercepts through-balls, rather than flinging himself at the final shot. Terry was part of the Chelsea team that won a crucial away game against Blackburn in 2005 . Blues legend Terry has been a key ingredient to Chelsea's most successful period as a club . The Blues skipper has won three Premier League titles with the Stamford Bridge club . Terry, seen here celebrating Chelsea's FA Cup win in 2012, has won 12 major honours during his time in blue . The common perception of his playing style is blood-and-guts, physical steel. Rarely does he get praise for his exceptional technical ability, which is at the heart of his renaissance. Wonderfully two-footed, his ability to send a 50-yard glided ball to start an attack is topped only by metronome-like short passing to the likes of Nemanja Matic. With his body on the wane, Terry has used ingenuity in adapting his game to re-establish himself as one of Chelsea's most crucial players. Once crashing into tackles as befitting his all-action style, the Chelsea captain has picked up just one booking this campaign – in the Champions League against Schalke. Terry struggled for a first-team place while former Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez (right) was in charge . Terry, known for his bravery, receives a boot to the face from Arsenal midfielder Abou Diaby during Chelsea's League Cup final win against Arsenal in 2007 . Critics will justifiably point to various off-pitch misdemeanours, although personally calling up a young fan this season in the wake of Jose Mourinho’s barbs at the Stamford Bridge crowd only enhanced his deification among the Chelsea faithful. It’s a relationship that has been built up over years – from his debut in 1998, through trials and tribulations both on and off the pitch to becoming the embodiment of the crowd on the field. Still the last player to come through Chelsea's academy and establish himself as a first-team regular, he is a link to the Chelsea of old, the thought behind the attacking delights of Eden Hazard, Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas. The Blues stalwart forged a strong bond with Jose Mourinho during the manager's first spell in charge . Terry has seen fellow club legends Frank Lampard (centre) and Ashley Cole (left) leave the club last summer . Terry has always responded to his critics in the best possible way. The same weekend the tabloids were plastered with tales of his alleged infidelity, he scored a crucial winner at Burnley. Consigned to the bench by fleeting Chelsea managers in Andre Villas-Boas and Rafael Benitez, not many could see him as the defence’s main man two years later. It was him, rather than Frank Lampard, deemed likely to be the first stalwart out of the exit door. Terry, pictured scoring against Southampton last season,  has now scored 44 headed goals for Chelsea . From his debut in 1998, through trials and tribulations both on and off the pitch, Terry has become the embodiment of the Chelsea fans on the pitch . But the way Terry reacted to his old mentor Mourinho’s return has perhaps been his most remarkable feat. A near ever-present since the start of last season, he has laughed in the face of suggestions he was finished at the top level. The 2005-vintage Terry is worthy of a place in any debate over the best centre half in Premier League history, sitting comfortably alongside the likes of Rio Ferdinand, Sol Campbell and Tony Adams. The 2014 re-boot, Terry reinventing his game to lead another Chelsea title charge a decade down the line, surely puts him without peer. Terry seems to thrive off silencing his critics, as the Chelsea skipper looks to lead his side to success .","John Terry scored his 60th goal for Chelsea as they beat Stoke on Monday .

"Despite surrendering a lead seven minutes into stoppage time against Liverpool, the Arsenal players seemed in good spirits as they enjoyed another Christmas party on Monday.

The striker was facing a three-match ban but will be available for Villa’s Boxing Day clash at Swansea after a hearing on Tuesday afternoon.

'It is great for us,’ Lambert said. 'I said at the time I didn't think it was a red card and everyone's assumption was the same. Ex-referees have come out and said it wasn't. 'So your own common sense told you it wasn't a red card. Gabby is playing really well at the minute so we hoped it would be rescinded.

"So the trademark white collar might be long gone, but the new All Blacks strip appears to be a hit with the players. After two years in the making the new outfit was revealed on Tuesday night and will be worn for the first time as they stride out against England at Twickenham this weekend. Team captain Richie McCaw said the new strip was a hit with the players, who were also involved at various stages during the kit's development to assist in measuring player movement and shape. The All Blacks players pose for the media during the adidas All Blacks Rugby World Cup kit launch . The New Zealand squad look ready for battle in their new look all black jersey . 'The boys love it,' he told the New Zealand Herald. 'I think it looks awesome. I'm a bit of a traditionalist when it comes to a rugby jersey, but it looks like a rugby jersey, and it's black, the blackest we've ever had in fact, and it feels pretty good on.' But that is not all. Due to the differing requirements of both forwards and backs, adidas created specific shirts for each position, which was a popular decision. 'The big boys need to be able to grip in the scrums, then you've got the backs who don't need to do that, so they want it as tight as possible so the other team can't get hold of it.' 'The team have always said that fit is what's most important to the players, so it's great to have two different jerseys for the forwards and backs.'

"Hull boss Steve Bruce has demanded an apology from out-of-favour defender Paul McShane. The Republic of Ireland international, who is a fans' favourite and the club's longest serving player, has featured just six times this season and has not been seen since the Burnley defeat on November 8. Since then relations appear to have deteriorated significantly, with the 28-year-old sent to train with the development squad. Steve Bruce has vented his fury after Paul McShane tweeted about being demoted by the Hull City boss . McShane sent this tweet on Friday revealing his demotion to training with the Under 21 side . Bruce's Tigers side have been in free fall since reaching the FA Cup final last season . He has also taken to retweeting fan comments about his continued exile, an act which has not gone down well with his manager. And while Bruce would not elaborate on the precise reasons for the current stand-off he was clear that there was only one way to resolve it. 'I heard all this nonsense about what's on Twitter and the rest of it but it's quite straightforward: Paul knows exactly why he's training with the Under-21 squad at the moment,' said Bruce. 'He's been quite quick to reveal that he is in there and I hope he comes out and tells the reason why. 'If he apologises to myself and to the squad then he will come back into the fold. It's entirely up to Paul.' Unless McShane works quickly he can expect to miss out once more against former club Sunderland on Boxing Day. McShane has featured just six times this season and has not played since facing Burnley in November . Bruce admits that there is still a place for McShane in the first-team if he apologises for his actions . With loanee Hatem Ben Arfa also having played his last game for an unimpressed Bruce, Tom Huddlestone and Jake Livermore both suspended and Michael Dawson, Mohamed Diame and Robert Snodgrass all injured, there is as much first-team talent unavailable as fit and ready for action. Bruce is eager for captain Curtis Davies to pull through after suffering a calf injury against Swansea last weekend. 'We don't know about Curtis, we'll have to see how he is, but he is extremely sore,' he added. To combat the team's personnel troubles, Bruce has recalled Tom Ince and Maynor Figueroa from their respective loan spells at Cardiff and Wigan. Neither player were knocking down the door before being sent away earlier this season, but may well find themselves involved in the busy festive period. 'Ince and Figueroa have trained with us for the first time on Tuesday,' said Bruce. 'We needed them to get games. They've had a few but not as many as I'd like, and, with the injuries and suspensions, we welcome them back.'","Paul McShane has been made to train with Hull's Under 21 side .

"Established in honour of Sportsmail legend Ian Wooldridge, who died almost eight years ago, his annual award is voted for by you. It celebrates the sporting genius and Corinthian spirit so beloved of ‘Woolers’. This year you picked Manchester United’s Darren Fletcher — now we invite you to nominate a sportsperson for next year. Here are some suggestions from our writers... Ian Wooldridge began writing for the Daily Mail in 1960 and worked for them for nearly 50 years . PAUL NEWMAN - Moeen Ali . I would like to nominate a very modern and very proud Englishman in Moeen Ali because I think Ian would like the cut of his jib. Not only would Woolers, who loved his cricket, appreciate the almost Gower-esque, left-handed strokeplay and off-spin bowling, but he would like Moeen the man. Above all, I think Ian would value how Moeen is a fantastic role model for British Muslims at a time when there are such atrocities going on in Iraq and Syria in the name of Islam. Moeen Ali bats during the sixth One Day International match between Sri Lanka and England earlier this month . JEFF POWELL - Carl Froch . Carl Froch, for the courage to go again after a tough fight with George Groves, not hide behind the first win. That gave our public a spectacular event in front of a record-breaking crowd at Wembley Stadium and one of the most phenomenal knock-outs in the history of the prize-ring. All on the 40th anniversary year of Muhammad Ali and George Foreman rumbling in the jungle, which Woolers was so delighted to cover — and did so with customary panache. Carl Froch knocks down George Groves to win the IBF and WBA World Super Middleweight Title fight . Sportsmail invites you to cast your vote now . LAURA WILLIAMSON - Lynsey Sharp . Lynsey Sharp defied serious illness and injury to win an emotional 800 metres Commonwealth silver medal on home turf in Glasgow — 28 years after her sprinter father, Cameron, collected the last of his five Commonwealth honours. The Scot then added European silver in Zurich and also broke the two-minute barrier for the first time in 2014. At a time when British female middle- distance running is thriving, Sharp has stood out — competing with style, heart and conviction. It’s amazing what you can achieve with a hole in your foot. DEREK LAWRENSON - Paul McGinley . I remember Woolers once describing the Ryder Cup as the best sporting show on earth, and how he would have loved this year’s contest at Gleneagles and having conversations with Europe’s captain, Paul McGinley. It would have been a mutual love-in, for the Dubliner enjoys picking the brains of sports writers. I can picture the pair jabbering away on all sporting topics, with a European Tour press officer in the background looking at his watch, wondering how on earth he was going to get McGinley to his next assignment on time. Lynsey Sharp celebrates winning sliver in the 800m at the Commonwealth Games in August . European Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley get soaked with champagne by members of his team . MIKE DICKSON - Caroline Wozniacki . Having been cursorily dumped by fiance Rory McIlroy in a phone call lasting a few minutes, Caroline Wozniacki could easily have collapsed in a heap. Her response was quite the opposite, renewing her commitment to tennis to the extent that she arrested her career slump and reached the final of the US Open. She also entered the New York Marathon when she was due to be married, raising money for charity. And all the time she managed to stay classy about her one-time partner, despite the enormous hurt. Ian would have been much impressed by the dignity and determination she showed, inside and out of the sporting arena.

During 2013 it was ludicrously suggested by some that Roger Federer was tarnishing his legacy by not retiring and avoiding what had become quite frequent defeats against lesser men. Those views showed no regard or respect for Federer’s deep love of his sport. Of course he’s a determined competitor, but that’s only ever been part of the story. Therefore, to see him retain that smile and joy this season while simultaneously going so close to regaining the world No 1 spot has been special. No-one should be wishing away his career because there might not be another one like him. Roger Federer plays the ball to Stan Wawrinka during the Tennis exhibition 'Match for Africa 2' MARTHA KELNER - Jo Pavey . Sometimes major breakthroughs take a while and it makes them all the more spectacular when they do happen. Jo Pavey was 40 and had been running competitively for 24 years when she won her first major title — 10,000m gold at the European Championships this summer. Just weeks earlier this mother from Devon fought the might of the Kenyan distance runners to clinch 5,000m bronze at the Commonwealth Games, having given birth to her second child Emily just 10 months beforehand. Jo’s story is not only inspiring to people who love running but it gives encouragement to ordinary mothers that they can achieve amazing feats. Not that Jo would think of herself in those terms — she is so humble. Jo and husband Gavin, also her coach, are targeting a fifth Olympics in Rio, with no lottery funding. You wouldn’t bet against her.

"Click here to read the reasons for the regulatory commission's decision. Mario Balotelli was spared a longer ban for posting a controversial image on Instagram because of his remorse. The FA have published the reasons for the regulatory commission's decision to hand the Liverpool striker a one-match ban and a fine of £25,000. They noted that 'Mr Balotelli added that he deeply regretted posting the image and that he had removed it as soon as it was brought to his attention by other users that the image could cause offence. Mario Balotelli was fined, suspended and ordered to attend educational classes after a  social media post . Balotelli's  ban came after the Liverpool striker uploaded a controversial post  to his Instagram account . Balotelli immediately received criticism upon uploading the post, and rejected the responses . But Balotelli wrote an apology on Twitter the day after, claiming it was meant to be 'anti-racist' And Balotelli apologised again for the incident on Twitter as his punishment was announced . 'He said that he was shocked to find the image was offensive because, out of sheer naivety, he had not understood the implication of the comments which appeared on the image.' Roger Burden, chairman of the regulatory commission, wrote: 'We believed that the other parts of Mr Balotelli’s submissions were sincere and entirely honest. 'We also noted his prompt withdrawal of the image, his cooperation with The FA enquiry and his apology through social media.' Balotelli missed Sunday's Premier League match with Arsenal and he must also attend an education course. The 24-year-old ruled out an appeal after the decision was made. The Italian firebrand has come under scrutiny after failing to score a Premier League goal this season . He said: ‘Following the recent events related to my Super Mario post, the FA decision has made it clear that I was wrong. ‘I am sorry that my team-mates and supporters of Liverpool FC have been penalised for something I did and have now come to regret. ‘It is my intention to comply with the decision of the FA and make sure that it never happens again.’ The furore started when Balotelli reposted a picture of the video game character Super Mario which read: ‘Don’t be racist — be like Mario. He’s an Italian plumber created by Japanese people who speaks English and looks like a Mexican.’ Below the picture, it added: ‘Jumps like a black man and grabs coin like a Jew.’ Balotelli has struggled to win Liverpool fans over, scoring twice since signing for the club in August . Balotelli holds a 'No to Racism' pennant ahead of Liverpool's Champions League clash with Real Madrid . Balotelli subsequently apologised on Twitter and insisted the image was meant to be ‘anti-racist with humour’. His statement read: ‘I apologise if I have offended anyone… I now understand that out of context it may have the opposite effect. Not all Mexicans have moustache, not all black people jump high and not all Jewish people love money. ‘I used a cartoon done by someone else because it has Super Mario and I thought it was funny and not offensive.’","Mario Balotelli was handed a one-match ban and a fine of £25,000 .

"When sport and social media collide it has the potential to conjure up a somewhat volatile cacophony of opinion and discord all squeezed into 140 characters. Let’s face it, there are a fair few sports men and women out there who like the sound of their own voice (not naming any names), but on the odd occasion there is that one person who brightens up your day with a perfectly executed comment. So, with that in mind as we prepare to wistfully say a fond farewell to yet another year, Sportsmail took a look back on  rather eventful 12 months for sports personalities on social media in order to crown the ultimate king and queen of Twitter. Mario Balotelli ruffled a few feathers when he commented on Manchester United's wobble against Leicester . Balotelli requested a kiss from the Queen if he helped England's chances during the World Cup last summer . The controversial striker apologising on Twitter for his anti-Semitic post on Instagram . The striker was banned for Liverpool's game against Arsenal on Sunday . 2014 King of Twitter - where to begin? There were various nominees for this illustrious title but in our eyes there was only one candidate for this one. He’s outspoken, yes, and gets into trouble for airing his sometimes ill-thought (but well-intentioned) thoughts online… and that person is Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli. Never one to shy away from the spotlight, Balotelli recently got himself into serious trouble for an Instagram post that used an anti-Semitic tone. Although the former Manchester City man apologised, he was consequently slapped with a £25,000 fine, a one match ban and forced to attend an education course to teach him the dos and don’ts of opening one's mouth. The Italy striker was on the losing side for his country's World Cup group clash with Costa Rica . With the issue seemingly put to bed (until the day he inevitably puts his foot in it again), we move onto why we believe the 24-year-old Italy front man deserves such accolade. And it was summed up in two concise but hilarious tweets. Following on from Manchester United’s embarrassing 5-3 defeat by Leicester back in September, Balotelli went on Twitter to let his fans know what he thought of Louis van Gaal’s poor start to the season. In just three words, Balotelli took down the Premier League giants with aplomb by saying ‘Man utd… LOL’, a tweet that received over 200,000 retweets and 100,000 favourites. Not bad. But his crowning moment came when he delivered again during last summer’s World Cup in Brazil. Speaking ahead of Italy’s clash with surprise group leaders Costa Rica, the controversial striker set sides splitting by saying if he were to score and keep England in competition for qualification he would expect a kiss from none other than the Queen herself... Italy lost 1-0 and England were sent packing. Maybe some other time, Mario. Tennis star Caroline Wozniacki had an emotional year following her split from golfer fiance Rory McIlroy . Wozniacki thanked her fans on Twitter s for their support, quoting Liverpool's motto to express her feelings . The former WTA Tour World No 1 and her ex-fiance and current world No 1 golfer McIlroy split in May . So on to this year's Queen of the Tweet. With fierce competition for the top spot in this contest, we traipsed through a vast amount of tweets from sportswomen throughout 2014. It has been a particularly roller coaster 12 months for former WTA Tour World No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki, who announced her engagement to professional golfer Rory McIlroy on New Year's Day only for him to break it off five months later. Pouring her heart out on Twitter, avid Liverpool fan Wozniacki thanked fans for their support, adding ‘Happy I support Liverpool right now because I know I’ll never walk alone’. The Danish tennis star showed she was recovering in this toung-in-cheek swipe at 5ft 7in Rory McIlroy . Not sure she’ll be as upbeat about her club following their jittery start to this season. But that didn't stop the 5ft 9in tennis star from hitting back at her former husband-to-be with a well-worded snipe at golfer McIlroy, who stands two inches smaller. Tweeting a picture of herself in some killer heels, the Scandanavian boasted about being able to wear the shoes for the first time since her relationship started with McIlroy. Ouch.","Sportsmail went through the archives for best tweets over the last year .

"The neice of David Farnell alerted child protection authorities that her paedophile uncle was caring for a baby 10 weeks before news of the Thai surrogacy scandal made international headlines. The West Australian Department of child protection was made aware of the fact on May 15, but acted only after news of the baby Gammy scandal broke to alert the Farnells they were being investigated for taking Gammy's healthy twin sister, Pipah, under their wing. WA Premier Colin Barnett told parliament on Wednesday that the niece had alerted the Department, whose Minister Helen Morton claims she knew nothing about until August 4 - 10 weeks after. Scroll down for video . Wendy Farnell has taken her healthy daughter Pipah to China while the WA Government investigates the parents for caring for her . WA child protection agencies knew Pipah was in the care of a convicted peadophile but did not act sooner . Ms Morton said the department did not act immediatley on the information it was provided because it was 'vague, quite guarded and non specific.' 'Anybody bringing information to the department does so probably with some concern for themselves in that circumstance,' The Australian reported. She said the niece's tip would have likely been caught up in one of 20,000 notifications handled by the department each year. West Australian Child Protection Minister Helen Morton . She also said the department would have made a judgement call not to prioiritise the matter based on 'incomplete information' the neice provided. She said: 'They (welfare officers) made a priority that In hindsight was not a good priority call.' The news comes as Ms Morton told media yesterday that Mrs Farnell had taken baby Pipah to China to grieve the death of her mother and would be returning at the end of the month. She said the department was aware of her departure and ongoing contact was being made on a daily basis with Mr Farnell. She made the admissions about knowing Mr Farnell had a child 'through an unknown arrangement' during a sitting of WA parliament on Tuesday. The minister said she found out on August 4 and an investigation began two days later. On Wednesday, she said the delay in investigating the Farnell family's circumstances was unacceptable and it came about because the South West team was overstretched at the time and had not correctly assessed the case as being a high priority. The person who had provided the tip-off had spoken in a very guarded way, so the information was 'fairly scant and a bit sketchy, and hard for the department to follow through with', Ms Morton said. Bioligical mother Pattaramon Chanbua has been given the responsibilityof caring for the nine month old since he was abandoned by Australian his parents . 'No address, little information about the child and how it came to be in that place et cetera - there was a paucity of information.' 'This, I think, was a case of staff having too much to do at the same time.' She said the case was still being assessed by the department, but the process had been held up because Mr Farnell's partner, Wendy, had gone to China after the death of her mother, and taken Pipah with her. 'In the meantime, we've been having daily contact with Mr Farnell,' Ms Morton said. Opposition spokesman Stephen Dawson said the revelations were a disgrace and 'heads should roll' at the department. 'Somebody has dropped the ball,' he said. 'It's a terrible indictment on the state government and the department that this issue has been let go on for so long.' 'I think the department is still under pressure and I am not sure whether every case is getting the attention it deserves.' But Ms Morton said a second South West team had been added after a four-month review that ended in August. 'I'm assured that something like this won't happen again,' she said.","Western Australia Department of Child Protection knew David Farnell was caring for baby Pipah .

"Russia's government has pushed the country into an economic crisis by not tackling its financial problems fast enough, former finance minister Alexei Kudrin has said . Russia's government has pushed the country into an economic crisis by not tackling its financial problems fast enough, former finance minister Alexei Kudrin has said. His comments came as the central bank bailed out its first victim of the collapsing currency and authorities announced a tax on grain exports to protect domestic stocks. A poll of 11 economists also predicted that Russia's gross domestic product would fall 3.6 per cent next year. Russia has been hit by what Economy Minister Alexei Ulyukayev recently called a 'perfect storm' of plummeting oil prices, sanctions related to its military action in Ukraine, and a flight of investors' capital. A lack of structural reforms has compounded the problem, making the economy overwhelmingly dependent on oil revenues. Kudrin, one of few to criticise President Vladimir Putin, said he believed the decline in the rouble could be attributed primarily to the sanctions, imposed following Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region and its subsequent support for loyalist fighters in the east. In a move to contain the ruble crisis, the government today instructed five of the country's biggest state-controlled exporters to reduce their foreign currency assets to October levels and to not raise them again until March. The companies targeted were gas giant Gazprom, oil companies Rosneft and Zarubezhneft and diamond producers Alrosa and Kristall. Today the ruble was steady as it has been for the past few trading sessions, floating around the 55 mark against the dollar. That's certainly an improvement on last week when the ruble plunged at one point to near 80 against the dollar. With retailers, particularly of imported products, looking to pass costs onto consumers in light of the ruble's fall, jittery consumers rushed to buy cars and emptied shelves at electronics and home appliances stores to pre-empt the price rises. Others besieged bank offices to withdraw their deposits and buy dollars or euros - the panic that raised the threat of a full-fledged banking crisis if it's not contained quickly. In response to the falling ruble, Russia's central bank last week increased its key interest rate to a whopping 17 per cent. Though that may help ease the selling pressure on the ruble by encouraging traders to hold onto the currency in anticipation of big returns, it is going to hobble Russian businesses and households. Scroll down for video . Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said Russia's current economic difficulties were exacerbated by Western sanctions, 'There are hopes to turn Russia into a pariah and reduce it to lower ranks in the ratings. This will never happen.' Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev promised that the interest rate will be reduced once the ruble stabilizes, but acknowledged that the country faces the risk of a 'deep recession.' Medvedev said Russia's current economic difficulties were exacerbated by Western sanctions. He said the economy is in a worse place now than in the 2008 crisis because 'a number of countries are effectively hampering the development of our economy.' He said: 'There are hopes to turn Russia into a pariah and reduce it to lower ranks in the ratings. This will never happen.' Putin discussed the Ukraine crisis with the leaders of Germany, France and Ukraine by telephone yesterday, the Kremlin said, noting that a ceasefire had largely held in eastern Ukraine in recent days. It said the leaders had emphasised the importance of removing heavy weapons and exchanging prisoners, but gave no indication of whether a breakthrough had been reached. Government officials have tried to minimise the impact of sanctions on the country and its currency, which plunged 80 per cent against the dollar last week despite a hike in interest rates to 17 per cent. Putin has claimed 'external factors' like oil were the key factor behind the country's 'tough times'. Kudrin warned that Russia risked having its debt downgraded to junk status in 2015. He said: 'We have entered or are entering a real, full-fledged economic crisis. Next year we will feel it clearly. Putin, seen above during a Russian press conference last week, discussed the Ukraine crisis with the leaders of Germany, France and Ukraine by telephone yesterday, the Kremlin said. It said the leaders had emphasised the importance of removing heavy weapons and exchanging prisoners, but gave no indication of whether a breakthrough had been reached. 'The government has not been quick enough to address the situation ... I am yet to hear ... its clear assessment of the current situation.' Kudrin quit in 2011 in protest at proposals to increase defence spending, although he and Putin are still believed to be close. Mounting evidence suggested that Russia's economic pain and isolation were starting to bite. The country announced plans to impose a heavy tax on grain exports since rouble volatility and high global prices have caused exports to spike: . And Russia's central bank said it would have to bail out mid-sized Trust Bank with 30 billion roubles (£347 million) to stop it going bankrupt. The country's largest lender Sberbank was forced to deny a report from RIA news agency that it had suspended taking new requests for auto loans and mortgages. Though Russia's biggest oil firm Rosneft partially eased some worries by saying it had made a £4.5 billion debt repayment from its own cash reserves - investors had been concerned it could default because the sanctions cut off its access to Western finance. It announced separately that a deal to acquire an oil trading business from Morgan Stanley had been terminated due to a refusal by regulators in the U.S. to clear it. Russia has been hit by what Economy Minister Alexei Ulyukayev recently called a 'perfect storm' of plummeting oil prices, sanctions related to its military action in Ukraine, and a flight of investors' capital. A lack of structural reforms has compounded the problem, making the economy overwhelmingly dependent on oil revenues . The termination of the deal is another blow for Rosneft after its partners including ExxonMobil withdrew from projects to develop Arctic offshore oil deposits after the sanctions were introduced. Kudrin forecast a series of defaults among both medium and large companies, though he said banks would probably be supported by the state which was likely to result in rating agencies downgrading Russia's debt to 'junk' status. The rouble firmed against the dollar yesterday, with exporters responding to Putin's urge to sell their foreign currency revenues on the market, and Brent crude prices stood close to £38 a barrel. While the currency, down some 45 per cent against the dollar so far this year, may stabilise in the first quarter of next year, its decline will likely help to push inflation to a rate of 12-15 per cent in 2015, Kudrin said. The central bank envisages next year's inflation at around 8 per cent. Economists have predicted it would be as high as 9.2 percent. Kudrin said he believed that between 25 and 35 per cent of the decline in the rouble could be attributed to sanctions. The rest, he said, was down to a stronger dollar and investors' mistrust of Russian authorities and their actions. His outlook for the economy next year was bleak: Even if the price of oil rose to £51 per barrel, gross domestic product was still likely to fall by more than 2 per cent in 2015, Kudrin said. At £38 per barrel GDP would decline by 4 per cent or more, he added, echoing the central bank's latest assessment, published last week.","Government tells top exporters to reduce their foreign currency assets .

"The walls were closing in on Blackpool’s Karl Oyston on Tuesday evening after club president Valeri Belokon called for him to resign and shirt sponsors Wonga branded his behaviour ‘unacceptable’. A flurry of abusive text messages sent by the chairman to supporters - in which he labelled one a ‘retard’ and told him to ‘enjoy his special needs day out’ - have caused uproar throughout the world of football after being published on Sunday. In the appalling exchanges, seen by Sportsmail, Oyston mocked a fan as an ‘intellectual cripple’ and called him a ‘p****’. There has been a strong defiance to his actions as both Belokon and Wonga condemned the Seasiders’ chief on the same day. Blackpool supporters are calling for chairman Karl Oyston to resign after abusive text messages to fans . Blackpool president Valeri Belokon is unhappy with the running of the club and called for Oyston to resign . Blackpool manager Lee Clark looks on during his side's 6-1 defeat to Bournemouth on Saturday . In a statement Wonga - whose sponsorship at Bloomfield Road is up at the end of the season - said: ‘The comments were unacceptable, something we’ll be making clear to the club.’ That came just hours after Belokon, who has designs of buying Blackpool, said Oyston must stand down as chairman. The Latvian millionaire stated that Oyston isn’t fit to remain in charge and reiterated that he does possess the money to buy the controlling family out. ‘I would like that he goes as chairman. I will write to Karl Oyston that maybe he should go,’ Belokon told the BBC. ‘I would like to invite Blackpool fans to write and sign an open letter for exclusion of such an attitude towards football fans.’ Oyston was left embarrassed at the weekend after a string of abhorrent messages he sent to disgruntled fans, who had found his number on social media, became public knowledge. Supporter Steve Smith was branded a ‘retard’ and ‘intellectual cripple’ by Oyston, whose beleaguered side lost 6-1 at home against Bournemouth on Saturday and are bottom of the Championship. One rant from Oyston, who had abuse hurled at him as well, read: ‘Stop texting f******, you shouldn’t have ever started as you are one tiresome f***** that should spot trains not watch football. Get a life and consider yourself banned from the stadium. ‘You are banned because I think you are a p****. ‘Impossible to have a meaningful conversation with such a f******* as you.’ Harry Arter shoots and scores for Bournemouth with Blackpool rooted to the bottom of the Championship . Oyston apologised on Monday, saying in a statement: ‘I would like to unreservedly apologise for any offence or distress caused by my text responses reported in the media recently.’ Oyston had also joked with other fans that plans are afoot to see Blackpool, a Premier League side four years ago, spiral down to the Conference, with another text reading: ‘I am a never-ending nightmare revenge mission’. Smith wants the FA and Football League to take action. ‘The texts are disgusting, politically incorrect and show that Karl needs to be put through the fit and proper person’s test. Let’s not forget he is supposed to be a figurehead in football,’ he said. ‘His position is untenable. He’s been untouchable for years and the FA haven’t done anything about his actions.’ Ismail Kaji, who has a learning disability and works for the charity Mencap, said that the ‘disgusting’ language made him ‘sick’. ‘I would feel ashamed however to support any football club that has a chairman who uses such disgusting language to people with a disability,’ he said. ‘This language is just as bad as using racist or homophobic words. There is no difference and it makes me sick.’ Sportsmail contacted Blackpool for comment on Tuesday afternoon and are awaiting response.","Valeri Belokon has called for chairman Karl Oyston to resign .

"Stuart McCall has admitted to enduring sleepless nights before realising he no longer had the answers to halt Motherwell’s slide in form. The 50-year-old released an emotional open letter to supporters on the Motherwell website, reflecting on both the remarkable achievements of his four-year spell at Fir Park and the thinking behind his decision to step down. McCall resigned as manager on Sunday evening, 48 hours after his side suffered a fifth successive defeat with a 2-1 loss at St Johnstone. Stuart McCall quit as Motherwell manager after failing to halt his side's slide in recent weeks . Motherwell's defeat to St Johnstone was their fifth in succession and proved to be McCall's final game . The former Scotland midfielder feared his own despondency at being unable to turn results around could have a further negative impact on the squad. That led him to the conclusion it was best to step aside, with assistant manager Kenny Black in caretaker charge for Friday’s visit of Dundee United while the process of appointing a replacement begins. ‘I struggled to sleep after Friday’s game with St Johnstone then woke up again during the night, Saturday into Sunday, thinking about the Dundee United game and I just couldn’t come up with any answers,’ said McCall. ‘I felt that with the international break coming up, now would be a good time to step aside to allow the club time. ‘I have a hope that with a fresh voice and maybe some new ideas, it will give the players that little boost they need. I felt that if I didn’t have the same hunger or desire, if I was deflated, then the players would sense that and that’s not what they, or the club, needs at this point. ‘This season has been difficult and when you become apprehensive about the next game, that’s your body’s way of telling you that maybe things have come to an end. ‘Both as a player and manager, you should work all week and really look forward to matches, but if you have that negativity in your head, it’s difficult and I don’t want that to make our situation any worse. I care too much about the place and the people who work here.’ While his last few months in charge were painful, McCall’s tenure will go down in Motherwell’s history as one of great success. Back-to-back runners-up finishes in the league were joined by continental adventures in the Champions League and Europa League, as well as an appearance in the 2011 Scottish Cup Final. McCall helped Motherwell to the qualifying stages of the Champions League where they lost to Panathinaikos . McCall also took Motherwell to the 2011 Scottish Cup final where they lost to Celtic at Hampden . ‘It’s fair to say that the last 24 hours or so have been incredibly difficult and emotional for me personally,’ he said. ‘However, it has also given me time to reflect on what has been four wonderful years. ‘Seeing what getting to a national final meant to the fans, and also the town itself, is something that will live with me forever. ‘I think back to the night we beat Hearts to qualify for the Champions League, then the atmosphere at Fir Park for that game against Panathinaikos. For a lot of our players, that was the highlight of their career, playing at that level. ‘I remember coming back from 2-0 down at Easter Road to win and no one will ever forget that game at Pittodrie (on the last day of last season). That will go down as one of the best days I’ve ever had in football. ‘I just hope the amount of highs cancel out some of the disappointments when people look back at what we’ve achieved here.’ McCall paid glowing tribute to his players, backroom team, club directors, office staff and supporters for their ‘invaluable’ assistance. ‘I would ask you all to rally around the club and the players in the next few weeks and months,’ he added. ‘Nothing would give me more pleasure if I am back up the road next May with my claret and amber scarf, with the team having picked up in the league, watching Motherwell at the Scottish Cup Final once again.’","Stuart McCall brought an end to his four-year reign as Motherwell boss .

"A jury found a Canadian man guilty on Tuesday of killing and dismembering his Chinese lover and mailing the body parts to schools and political parties around Canada. Luka Magnotta was convicted of first-degree murder in the 2012 slaying of Jun Lin after eight days of jury deliberations. He was also convicted on the four other related charges, resulting in life imprisonment. Magnotta, 32, had pleaded not guilty. While he admitted to the slaying, he sought to be found not criminally responsible by reason of insanity. Luka Magnotta (left) was convicted of first-degree murder in the 2012 slaying of Jun Lin (right) after eight days of jury deliberations. He was also convicted on the four other related charges . Diran Lin, center, father of Jun Lin leaves the Montreal Courthouse alongside his lawyer Daniel Urbas and translator . His lawyer argued he is schizophrenic and couldn't tell right from wrong at the time of the slaying. The prosecution countered the crime was both planned and deliberate and that Magnotta's behavior and actions were not those of an insane person. After the verdict was read, deciding his fate, Magnotta closed his eyes and showed no emotion in the Montreal courtroom, CBC News reports. Diran Lin, the victim's father, traveled from China to Montreal to watch the court proceedings from a private room. After the verdict, Daniel Urbas, a lawyer, read an impact statement on behalf of the Lin, Yahoo News reports. 'I had come to see your trial system to see justice done and I leave satisfied that you have not let my son down,' Urbas said in the courtroom, on behalf of Lin. 'I had come to see remorse, to hear some form of apology, and I leave without anything.' Verdict: After the verdict was read, deciding his fate, Magnotta closed his eyes and showed no emotion in the Montreal courtroom (photographed is a tweet from Sidhartha Banerjee quoting a statement from the Lin family, delivered by lawyer Daniel Urbas) The fate of the killer has attracted much attention with people tweeting from both inside and outside of the courtroom during the eighth and final day of deliberations. The case shocked Canadians and quickly gained international notoriety when body parts arrived at offices of Canada's biggest political parties and a video appeared online that prosecutors say shows Magnotta stabbing and having sex with the dismembered corpse. In May 2012, a package containing a severed foot was found at the headquarters of Canada's ruling Conservative Party. That same day, a hand was discovered at a postal facility in a package addressed to the Liberal Party of Canada.

"Jon Bon Jovi showed his support for embattled New York police officers last night by wearing an NYPD t-shirt on stage during his New Jersey concert. The singer wore a 'Property of NYPD Football XXL' t-shirt for the Bobby Bandiera and Friends Hope Concert at the Count Basie Theatre in Red Bank, New Jersey, on Monday. 'I'm showing a little solidarity for my brothers in the NYPD and all of those who protect and serve us everyday, no matter what the risks,' he told the cheering crowd, the Asbury Park Press reported. The show of support came two days after New York police officers Rafael Ramos, 40, and Wen Jian Liu, 32, were killed in an execution-style murder as they sat in their patrol vehicle in Brooklyn. Scroll down for video . Supporter: Jon Bon Jovi wore a shirt reading, 'Property of NYPD Football XXL' for a concert in New Jersey on Monday night and said he was wearing it to show 'a little solidarity for my brothers in the NYPD' The crowd at the Count Basie Theatre in Red Bank, New Jersey cheered as he explained his reasoning . Their killer, 28-year-old Ismaaiyl Brinsley, ran into a subway stop and shot himself dead. Before the attack, Brinsley had posted on Instagram that he was going to put 'wings on pigs' in retaliation for the recent deaths of black males - including Eric Garner and Michael Brown - at the hands of white police officers. Since Saturday's tragedy, many have flocked to support the families of the fallen police officers, including the youngest daughter of Eric Garner, Emerald Snipes-Garner. She attended a memorial for the police officers on Monday and also visited the home of Ramos' family, she said. 'It hit my heart because I know what it feels like with this upcoming season and you don't have your father around,' she said. 'I know firsthand what you're feeling.' Other high-profile figures have also given their support to the police. See more on YouTube .

Together: The Colts' Matt Overton also signaled his support during Sunday's game against the Cowboys . At the weekend, New York Jets center Nick Mangold headed to the field for Sunday's game against the New England Patriots wearing an NYPD cap, which he only removed after the coin toss. 'Those two officers, it's a shame,' Mangold said, ESPN reported. 'Those guys, they do a great job. 'I've been here nine years. Every one of those guys that's out there, that risks their lives every day, to go out there and keep the community safe, protect the community - for that to happen, for those two guys, for their families, that's a raw deal.' New York Giants' head coach Tom Coughlin also wore a black strip on the left shoulder and a small silver peace sign under the 'NY' logo on his chest in honor of the officers. 'The New York Giants wanted to honor and mourn the assassination of the two New York City policemen that took place last night,' Coughlin said at a post-game news conference. Standing by them: Wenjian Liu, 32, (left) and Rafael Ramos, 40, (right) were killed execution-style as they had lunch in their patrol car in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn on Saturday afternoon .

"President Barack Obama praised Sony Pictures on Tuesday after learning that it had changed course and decided to release The Interview on Christmas Day after all. 'The president applauds Sony’s decision to authorize screenings of the film,' a spokesman for the president told reporters. 'As the president made clear, we are a country that believes in free speech, and the right of artistic expression,' spokesman Eric Schultz said. 'The decision made by Sony and participating theaters allows people to make their own choices about the film, and we welcome that outcome.' The about face by Sony, which had cancelled the film's debut after terrorists threatened to attack theaters that showed it, follows a massive national outcry for the movie studio not to give in to agitators' demands. One Republican politician had even requested that the White House screen the film so that members of Congress could at least see it so that America did not look weak among its enemies. President Barack Obama said through a spokesman today that he welcomes Sony's decision to release the Interview as planned on Christmas Day . This photo provided by Columbia Pictures, depicts James Franco, center, as Dave, and Seth Rogen, right, as Aaron, in The Interview. The film's maker, Sony Pictures, was refusing to honor a Thursday release of the movie after cyber hackers threatened to attack theaters that showed it but made an about face today . In a letter to Obama to Louisiana Sen. David Vitter requested that the Commander in Chief hold a special viewing of The Interview on Jan. 5, the day after he returns from his 17-day vacation to Hawaii. The event should also include a 'serious discussion of the strong, substantive retaliatory measures' that the United States plans to inflict on North Korea for its actions, Vitter said. Likewise, Democratic Congressman Brad Sherman was lobbying Sony to allow the movie, starring James Franco and Seth Rogen, to be shown at the U.S. Capitol for educational purposes and so that Members of Congress can show their solidarity with the motion picture industry. Sony's decision to pull the film was preceded by a cyber hack on its computers by North Korea. Cyber terrorists then warned of 9/11 style attacks if the the film, which depicts the fake assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, were distributed as planned, leading major theater chains to back away from showing it. President Obama had reprimanded Sony last week for giving into the attackers demands and warned that such appeasements set a bad precedent. 'We cannot have a society in which some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States,' Obama told reporters at his year-end press conference. 'Let’s not get into that way of doing business,' he later said. He also promised to take retaliatory action against North Korea for hacking Sony's computers and exposing embarrassing emails and sensitive employee information. He did not go into detail about what kind of actions he was considering, however. 'We will respond proportionally, and we’ll respond in a place and time and manner that we choose. It’s not something that I will announce here today at a press conference,' he said. The White House did not rule out its own screening of the film at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue when asked about the prospect by reporters last week, but White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest pointed to the president's vacation and said, 'I don't think we're going to be showing the film here anytime soon.' At his news conference the following day Obama wouldn't say if he planned to hold a viewing or watch the film himself as a symbolic gesture. 'I’ve got a long list of movies I’m going to be watching,' he said referring to his holiday plans. He added moments later, 'I never release my full movie list.' That's not to say that other White House and government officials haven't seen the film though, the White House said last week. 'Administration officials were consulted about the film prior to its release, at the request of the company that was producing it,' Earnest told reporter. 'Input was shared.' On Tuesday Sony Pictures Entertainment announced a limited theatrical release of the movie, with the company's CEO Michael Lynton saying in a statement, 'We have never given up on releasing The Interview.' 'While we hope this is only the first step of the film's release, we are proud to make it available to the public and to have stood up to those who attempted to suppress free speech,' he said. Sony said it had received commitments roughly 200 theaters across America to show the movie beginning on Thursday. Republican Sen. David Vitter, pictured here at a Capitol Hill hearing in February, wants President Obama to show The Interview at the White House to send a 'strong message' to North Korea and other 'rogue actors' that the U.S. cannot be bullied into submission . Politicians from both major political parties had been encouraging Sony to make the film available to the greater population so that Americans might come to their own conclusions about the movie. 'Dear @SonyPictures - please make #TheInterviewMovie available in DVD so I can decide whether to see it, not N. Korea,' Democratic Rep. Steve Israel of New York tweeted. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus sent Sony a letter pledging the GOP's full support behind showings of the film and even promised to send a note to the 'Republican Party's millions of donors and supporters urging them to buy a ticket -- not to support one movie or Hollywood, but to show North Korea we cannot be bullied into giving up our freedom.' Even if the film is not distributed en masse, yet, lawmakers on Capitol Hill say they'd at least like to be able to see it so they can better understand why North Korea would go to such great lengths to to keep it under wraps. 'Threats from a dictator in North Korea should not stop Americans from seeing any movie. We have a responsibility to stand up against these attempts at intimidation,' California's Sherman wrote in a letter to Sony. 'This is also about educating Members of Congress. Everyone is talking about The Interview,' he continued. 'I think it’s important for Congress to know, and see, what we are talking about.' Sherman went on to explain that in watching the film Congress will demonstrate to the world its 'support of the freedom of speech.' 'This is about our right to live without fear, and knowing that our values will not be compromised by the idle threats of a despotic regime,' he said. 'Good or bad, Americans should not be deprived of the opportunity to see this movie.' The Democratic Congressman said the federal government has a responsibility 'to allocate the necessary resources to ensure moviegoers’ safety' if Sony Pictures decides to send the film to theaters nationwide after all and that its up to Congress to help 'moviegoers regain the confidence to go see The Interview.' On the left North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is pictured waving to spectators and participants of a mass military parade in July. The scene on the right depicts the death of Un's character in the The Interview . In the letter to Obama requesting a White House showing, Louisiana Sen. Vitter pressured the president to take 'strong action' against North Korea to show that the U.S. cannot be coerced into submission. 'The policy of rewarding terrorists, authoritarianism, and cruelty with concessions should not be the legacy we pursue,' he said. Echoing Obama's own words during his news conference last Friday, Vitter argued that 'North Korea and other rogue actors are likely to be emboldened' by recent events. Vitter argued that Obama needs to take these steps to counteract his administration's 'past weak policies, which have irreversible outcomes,' which include the the May exchange of five Taliban commanders for missing soldier Sgt. Bowe Berghdahl and last week's release of five Cuban spies in a swap for political prisoners of Raul Castro's regime. 'A strong message needs to be delivered to reassure the American people and U.S. businesses that we will not bend to the will of bad actors, whether they are hackers, terrorist, state-sponsors of terrorism, or nation states,' he said. 'The actions of the American government must step up to demonstrate that rogue actors across the world will not be rewarded for bad behavior.' The U.S may have already struck back at North Korea. Current internet outages across the country are rumored to be the result of a cyber attack carried out by the United States. The State Department would not confirm on Monday that the U.S. was behind the alleged cyber attack but its spokesperson hinted that it might be.","The White House said the decision 'allows people to make their own choices about the film, and we welcome that outcome'

"A 300-million-year–old fish that resembles a small shark could see its prehistoric surroundings in colour, palaeontologists claim. The fossilied eye of the acanthodii fish is the earliest case of colour vision ever discovered in an animal. It is hoped that the discovery will enable scientists to pinpoint exactly when colour vision first evolved. A 300-million-year–old fish (pictured) that resembles a small shark could see its prehistoric surroundings in colour. The fossilied eye of the acanthodii fish is the earliest case of colour vision ever discovered in an animal . ‘This fossil fish eye is the first evidence to suggest animals saw in colour as early as 300 million years ago,’ Professor Andrew Parker, Research Leader at the Natural History Museum said. ‘It is the first case of colour vision in an ancient, extinct animal, proving colour vision existed a long time before the Jurassic period.’ This period stretched from approximately 200 to 146 million years ago. ‘The retina of this 300 million-year-old fish is very well preserved, enabling us to find the first record of cone cells and rods in animals. Scientists scanned the tissues in the fossilised eye of Acanthodes bridgei using an electron microscope. 'B' shows the creature's well-preserved eyes and gills, while 'C' shows a close-up of one of its eyes, including the pigment cells, which are the earliest proof of an animal seeing in colour . Ancanthodii fish are sometimes called spiny sharks, but are a class of extinct fish, which share features with bony fish. They may resemble sharks, but their epidermis was covered with tiny platelets, like the scales of gars. Their name was coined because they were superficially shark-shaped, with a streamlined body, paired fins and an upturned tail, snout and bony spines. They had a cartilage skeleton but their fins were bony. The earliest acanthodians were marine, but during the Devonian period, freshwater species became more common. Ancanthodiforma were filter feeders, with no teeth in their jaws, but could see in colour. ‘These are both in the retina of a modern human and animal eye to enable colour vision.' Cones are structures in the eye that are designed to absorb particular wavelengths of light and transmit them to the brain. Most people have three types of cones, which are tuned to wavelengths of red, green and blue. Rods are responsible for vision at low light levels. Professor Parker added: ‘We can now use these techniques to examine colour pigments in other ancient animals, bringing us closer to the time when colour vision first evolved.’ Scientists from the museum in London and Kumamoto University in the Kyushu region of Japan, scanned the tissues in the fossilised eye of Acanthodes bridgei using an electron microscope. Further chemical analysis on the fossil showed evidence of cone cells and rods in the retina, according to the study, which was published in Nature Communications. Parts of the visual system are not usually preserved in the fossil record because the soft tissue of the eye and brain decay rapidly after death, making the discovery particularly rare. Acanthodiforma were filter feeders, with no teeth in the jaw. Many paleonthologists consider that the acanthodians were close to the ancestors of bony fishes. Although their interior skeletons were made of cartilage, a bonelike material developed in the skins of these fish, in the form of closely fitting scales.","Fossilied eye of the acanthodii fish is the earliest case of colour vision .

"For the first time ever, Apple has pushed out a security update to all of its Mac customers automatically, without seeking prior approval first. A number of severe bugs were recently discovered on its OS X operating system that left it at risk of hackers. Although Apple has had the technology to automatically update people’s computers for years, it typically asks a user’s permission before installing security updates of this kind. A number of severe bugs were recently discovered on Apple's OS X operating system (pictured) that left it at risk of hackers. Although Apple has had the technology to automatically update people’s computers for years, it typically asks a user’s permission before installing security updates of this kind . Apple spokesman Bill Evans told Reuters the update is ‘seamless. It doesn't even require a restart.’ The firm added that it took these steps to protect customers as soon as possible, and an automatic update was the best way to do this. By comparison, Microsoft has been automatically issuing updates for its Windows software for years. The flaws were found by the Department of Homeland Security and the Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute. Apple annoyed users recently by automatically installing the latest U2 album on their devices -without their permission. The Songs of Innocence album was automatically added to iOS devices in 119 countries. This caused users to take to Twitter and Facebook to express outrage at the plans. While others moaned the album was difficult to remove from their devices. Apple later issued a website that helped people remove the songs from their phones and tablets in one click. They then published the vulnerabilities on Friday on the National Vulnerability Database. The bug specifically targets what’s known as the network time protocol (NTP), used to synchronise clocks on computers. The protocol is a global way of synchronising time over a network, and because of its link to networks it has previously been exploited by hackers. Apple’s Mac software uses NTP, but it is also used by servers and other companies that run Linux software, for example. However, no firms have reported any cases of hackers exploiting this vulnerability. Apple's update is available for OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.5, OS X Mavericks v10.9.5 and OS X Yosemite v10.10.1. Ken Westin, senior security analyst at Tripwire said: ‘Apple’s proactive steps to automatically remediate this particular vulnerability shows the need to quickly patch vulnerabilities. ‘However, Apple’s automatic tool is not without risks, as even the simplest update can cause problems for some systems.’ The flaws (details pictured) were found by the Department of Homeland Security and the Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute. The bug specifically targets what’s known as the network time protocol (NTP), used to synchronise clocks on computers.

"A remarkable photographic exhibition shows the family homes abandoned to decay on remote Scottish islands because relatives cannot bear to sell them. The haunting images, taken in the Outer Hebrides by former Buzzcocks drummer John Maher, show the properties slowly rotting away and remaining untouched and unchanged since the day the owner died. The homes, many of them original crofters' cottages miles from the nearest road, appear frozen in time and some have become memorials to the dead of the islands. This crofters' cottage on the Isle of Scalpay has clearly not been inhabited for years - the original stone chimneys can be seen, in contrast to the corrugated iron front, which would have been a relatively recent addition in order to keep out the bitter Hebridean winds . This eerie photo was taken from inside a crofters' cottage on the Isle of Harris - the broken glass cannot hide the beautiful sea view . In some cases, estate agents have received enquires to buy the properties but were ordered to turn them down as relatives cling on to past lives in crofting communities. Now the stories behind the lost homes of Lewis, Harris and other islands have been revealed with the help of social media and will form part of an exhibition in Edinburgh which opens on January 4. The exhibition will feature pictures taken by Maher and Fife-based photographer Ian Paterson as well as a new concerto composed by former Scots Trad Music Awards winner Mike Vass. The hauntingly beautiful photographs show lives suspended in time with wedding pictures on mantelpieces, beds fully made and even dinner plates on the table. This picture shows the home of Kenneth and Peggy MacKinnon on the Isle of Harris. Although the couple later left the island  they continued to make an annual pilgrimage home to light the fire and sit in the front room together - it was Peggy's last wish for the house to remain as it was . The exterior of the MacKinnon's home on the Isle of Harris - like many it had a corrugated iron casing to protect it from the harsh weather . This photo shows a home in the Isle of Harris which still has a family's sideboard, armchair and knick knacks despite the state of disrepair . A living room in a cottage on the island of Scalpay - the chair with a favourite blanket thrown over it is still positioned in front of the TV . Mr Mahar, who drummed on 70s hits such as Ever Fallen in Love, stumbled across the hidden treasures when taking outdoor nighttime photographs around the Outer Hebrides. After entering the lost homes his interest soon turned to what was inside. 'In some of them you see so many personal belongings that have been left behind,' said Maher. 'There was one house with a suitcase on the bed and letters on the side board that haven't been opened.' This photo, titled 'George's House' was taken on the small Island of Eriskay which lies between South Uist and the Isle of Barra . This extraordinary image shows an abandoned crofters' cottage on an unnamed island in the Outer Hebrides with the sea behind it . The kitchen in a cottage on the Isle of Harris remains a cheerful shade of yellow - a clock, mirror and framed photo add a personal touch . He continued: 'In some houses it would be quite easy to spook yourself.' He teamed up with photographer Ian Paterson and soon the stories behind the mysterious houses started to emerged. Mr Paterson explained: 'The houses just exist as they are. It's very emotive. People still have a very close emotional attachment. There are a lot of emotions tied up in them.' After getting in touch with relatives through Facebook the story behind one of properties soon emerged. The house in Harris photographed by Maher still packed full of belongings was built by Kenneth and Peggy MacKinnon. This picture, taken on the Isle of Ensay, shows an abandoned bedroom with a neatly folded blanket on the bed and a view of a nearby chapel . The haunting images were taken on the islanda by former Buzzcocks drummer John Maher (pictured) and are part of an exhibition . This abandoned kitchen on Harris provides a snapshot in time - complete with old an fashioned teapot, a scythe and a framed photo . Although the couple left the island in their later years they continued to make an annual pilgrimage home to light the fire and sit in the front room together. 'One of her [Peggy's] last wishes was for the house to remain as it was,' said Paterson. 'There is still a very strong personal connection.' 'When the older generation die off there is no one to take the houses over,' explained a Stornoway estate agent. The agent, who asked not to be named, said often people ask about old abandoned croft houses - 'where people are looking for that kind of lifestyle on the island'. This blue bedroom was photographed on South Uist - a mirror remains over the fireplace and the paint is in suprisingly good condition . This attic bedroom in a cottage on Lewis has a beautiful original fireplace painted pink - which contrasts with the peeling walls and dusty floor . The houses are often left to lie as they are by families after the death of the owners as a memorial to their loved ones . But families often don't want to sell because 'it's the original family home'. 'It's sentimental family values. They have no intention to live in them at the moment,' she said. The remote locations of a lot of the properties - many of which were built before the roads and are not accessible by car - mean they lay hidden out of sight. Now they are at the mercy of the notorious Hebridean weather. 'Quite a few of these will disappear in the next five or ten years,' said Paterson. He added: 'Not all decay is bad decay. There is a lot of memories.' The exhibition 'Away Being' is launched on January 4th in Gallery 1 at St Margaret's House, 151 London Road, Edinburgh. The Outer Hebrides are also known as the Western Isles, the Long Isle and in Gaelic, as Na h-Eileanan Siar and Innse Gall. The Outer Hebrides are comprised of an island chain off the west coast of mainland Scotand. The 15 inhabited islands form part of the Hebrides, separated from the Scottish mainland and from the Inner Hebrides by the waters of the Minch, the Little Minch and the Sea of the Hebrides. The inhabited islands have a total population of 27,400 - but there are more than 50 substantial uninhabited islands. The Western Isles became part of the Norse kingdom of the Suðreyjar, which lasted for over 400 years until sovereignty was transferred to Scotland by the Treaty of Perth in 1266. Control of the islands was then held by clan chiefs, principal of whom were the MacLeods, MacDonalds, Mackenzies and MacNeils. The Highland Clearances of the 19th century, combined with the potato famine, had a devastating effect on many of the islands and it is only in recent years that population levels have stopped declining. Much of the land is now under local control and commercial activity is based on tourism, crofting, fishing, and weaving. The 1949 comedy Whisky Galore! was filmed on the Isle of Barra, the southernmost inhabited island in the Outer Hebrides. The film is based on the novel Whisky Galore by Sir Compton Mackenzie, itself a fictionalised telling of the story of the SS Politician, which ran aground with a cargo of 50,000 cases of whisky on board in 1941.","Photographs taken by former Buzzcocks drummer John Maher show abandoned homes on remote Scottish islands .

"New York City police officers shed tears today at a memorial for the two murdered at the site in Brooklyn where they were shot dead. Uniformed cops laid bouquets, lit candles and left toys around the street in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of the city where a crazed gunamn shot dead officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu. They were joined by mayor Bill de Blasio and his wife, who also laid flowers at the site in a show of unity with the police force, elements of which say the mayor had turned against them before the deaths. De Blasio later led city officials in a moment of silence at 2.47pm Monday - exactly three days after Ismaaiyl Brinsley opened fire on officers Ramos and Liu as they sat in their patrol car. Scroll down for videos . Grief: NYPD Lieutenant Tanisha Gurley is seen above with a single tear running down her face as she kneels in front of a makeshift memorial for slain officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu . Unity: Cops embraced one another while members of the public gathered to express their feelings at the Saturday double murder . Guest: Mayor Bill de Blasio - who has faced criticism from some officers - came to the memorial with his wife Chirlane McCray. The pair laid flowers and later led a moment of silence . Officers amassed at the memorial fell silent to honor their fallen comrades, as city leaders urged people around New York and the country to do the same. Mayor de Blasio told a press conference at City Hall: 'I want o ask everyone who is assembled here, and everyone who is watching to now bow our heads in memory of Officer Ramos and Officer Liu'. He then paused for around a minute and embraced his wife Chirlane McCray - then told others to do the same as a symbol of their communal grief. Today at the memorial, near the Myrtle/Willoughby subway stations on the G line, NYPD Lieutenant Tanisha Gurley was one of those mourning the two men. As she knelt in front of the memorial a single tear could be seen running down her cheek. Other officers were pictured embracing, while sobbing members of the public also paid their respects. Silence: Mayor Bill de Blasio bowed his head in City hall - and urged others to do the same - at 2.47pm, the time the officers were shot . Embrace: De Blasio and his wife Chirlane McCray embraced publicly after the silence and urged others to do likewise . Paying respects: At the memorial in Brooklyn, officers bowed their heads and paused as well . Grieving: The silence coincided with a message from NYPD commissioner Bill Bratton praising the two fallen officers . Details of a full funeral for officer Ramos - a regular church-goer who aspired to be a full-time minister - were announced, with a service in Queens set for December 27. Last night NYPD officials said arrangements for Liu's funeral would follow after relatives had been flown in from China. Earlier that day NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton posted a message honoring the fallen officers, and said the department will keep its flags at half-mast until after Christmas. He described Liu and Ramos as: 'loving fathers, husbands, and sons—points of great pride for their communities. 'They were also part of our NYPD family, bonded by the experiences, triumphs, and challenges we face so that others won’t have to.

"There's nothing quite like that first crunch in a fresh, untouched layer of snow. And whether its gathering snow balls or making snow angels, a white Christmas can bring out the playful side in many of us. But it seems we're not the only ones who take pleasure in a snow day. A recent study found that playing in the snow is also the favourite past-time of small birds. Researchers have long wondered by redpolls (left) in Maine burrow through snow (right). Now, one researcher from the University of Vermont claims it is simple because they want to have fun like the rest of us . Professor Bernd Heinrich at the University of Vermont spent two years watching a flock of about 150 redpolls. Between November 2012 and the following February 2013, the birds created at least 252 cavities and short tunnels in the snow in Western Maine, according to a study published in Northeastern Naturalist. Professor Heinrich told the New Scientist that he had always wondered why these birds dug small tunnels and trenches when there was no food burned beneath the snow. The birds didn't require any shelter, and they were also unlikely to be bathing, as they were already clean. Playtime: Between November 2012 and the following February 2013, the birds created at least 252 cavities and short tunnels in the snow in Western Maine . Mystery: Professor Heinrich said he had always wondered why these birds dug small tunnels and trenches (pictured) when there was no food burned beneath the snow . Family fun: The scientists said that when one bird tunnels with gusto, all its friends and family will stop what they are doing to tunnel too, suggesting it is a social activity. Pictured are example of redpoll tunnels . Instead, he came to the conclusion that the birds were simply enjoying playing in the snow. He added that when one bird tunnels with gusto, all its friends and family will stop what they are doing to tunnel too, suggesting it is a social activity. 'Play is defined as behaviour with no immediate function, so in that sense, yes, it is 'just' play,' Professor Heinrich continued. He said that the playful behaviour may have its roots in birds farther north who tunnel to stay warm in insulated pockets of snow in the Arctic tundra. In the Artic, the snow rarely thaws, but in Maine, it can develop an icy crust. Professor Heinrich noted that redpolls in Maine do not burrow at night, suggesting they do not need it to keep warm. The playful behaviour of redpolls (pictured) in Maine may have its roots in birds who live farther north. Scientists believe these northern creatures tunnel to stay warm in insulated pockets of snow in the Arctic . Golden-winged warblers that live in the mountains of eastern Tennessee were spotted fleeing their breeding grounds ahead of the arrival of the powerful supercell storm . Two days before a storm hit Tennessee that spawned 84 tornadoes and killed 35 people earlier this year, there was a mass exodus of birds. Golden-winged warblers that live in the mountains of eastern Tennessee were spotted fleeing their breeding grounds ahead of the arrival of the powerful supercell storm. And the discovery was made by accident while researchers were testing whether the warblers - which weigh less than two small coins - could carry geolocators on their backs. It turned out they could. With a big storm brewing, the birds were seen taking off from their breeding ground, where they had only just arrived, as part of an unplanned migratory event. The birds were alerted when the storm was 560 miles (900km) away, causing them to flee to Cuba before making the return trip once the storm had passed. Overall, the warblers travelled 930 miles (1,500 km) in just five days to avoid the deadly storms.","The playful birds have been spotted digging through the snow in Maine .

"More than 60 million people worldwide suffer from autism, and many struggle to make eye contact and have poor social skills. While there is no cure for the condition, the use of technology in autism treatment has grown in popularity in recent years. And Samsung’s latest Look At Me app uses technology in a way that helps improve eye contact and boost autistic children’s social skills and facial recognition abilities. Scroll down for video . This app (pictured) was developed by Samsung, in collaboration with professors, doctors and designers in South Korea. The team created a series of games, or ‘missions’ designed specifically to help children with autism make eye contact, read facial expressions and express their emotions . This app was developed by Samsung, in collaboration with professors, doctors and designers in South Korea. The team created a series of games, or ‘missions’ designed specifically to help children with autism make eye contact, read facial expressions and express their emotions. For example, one game uses the front-facing camera to place the child’s face within a frame and take an image. This is thought to improve facial recognition and spatial awareness. Autism is a neurological disorder that affects how a person . communicates, and relates to, other people. It can also affect how they . make sense of the world around them. People . with autism typically have trouble communicating, looking people in the . eye, and can get upset by loud noises or bright lights. They may also have a sensitivity to touch, tastes, smells and colours. In particular, many autistic people like order and predictability. Autism . is a spectrum condition, which means that while all people with autism . share certain difficulties, their condition affects them in different . ways. Some people with . autism, for example, are able to live relatively independent lives but . others may have accompanying learning disabilities and need specialist . support. Asperger syndrome is a form of autism and people with the syndrome are often of average or above average intelligence. They have fewer problems with speech but may still have difficulties with understanding and processing language. Another game places faces of other people in small dots over a person’s eyes. The child has to identify which person’s face appears in the dot from a selection. This also teaches facial recognition, as well as the ability to pick up clues by focusing on a person’s eyes, explained the firm. A third game asks the child to identify happy and sad faces from a line-up. This was designed to help autism sufferers recognise emotions. For each correct answer, the users receive character cards and points, while music and voice guides can be customised to take children through the games. During tests, 20 children were trained on the app over an eight-week period and 60 per cent of them showed a noticeable improvement. Professor Kyong-Mee Chung from the Department of Psychology at Yonsei University said: ‘This program will help children with autism improve their social skills and relationships.’ Paediatric psychologist Hee-Jung Yoo from Seoul National University added: ‘Another benefit is that it is effective in encouraging a triangulation communication system, where children with autism can communicate with other people with the aid of a device. Samsung’s Look At Me app isn’t the first to use technology in this way. Toca Boca in Sweden, for example, creates apps aimed primarily at children aged between three and six. Toca Band encourages children to make music and learn about rhythm and tempo, while Toca Hair Salon Me lets players give their family and friends virtual haircuts. One game uses the front-facing camera to place the child’s face within a frame and take an image (pictured). This improves facial recognition and spatial awareness. During tests, 60% of the children who used the app for eight weeks showed a noticeable improvement in these social skills . Another games asks the child to identify happy and sad faces from a line-up (pictured). This game was designed to help autism sufferers recognise emotions and learn clues about emotions from people's faces . The firm calls the characters in the apps ‘digital toys’ and although the games are not specifically designed for children with autism, they have proved popular among parents who have children with the condition. Rhiannan Walton, 32, from West London has been a speech and language therapist for eight years. She began using technology in her therapy sessions with autistic children approximately 18 months ago. ‘Technology responds in the same way every time; you press a button and it responds how you expect it to,' Walton told MailOnline. 'This particularly appeals to autistic children who can become scared and confused by unpredictability.' For each correct answer, the children receive character cards and points, while music and voice guides can be customised to take children through the games. The free Android app is compatible with Samsung’s Galaxy S4, S4 and S5, Galaxy Note and Zoom range, and the Galaxy Tab S . Many autistic children like trains, for example, because they are predictable. They follow set paths along stable tracks and their doors open and close in the same way each time. For therapy to work, Ms Walton believes it has to be motivating, and technology motivates children with autism in a unique way. ‘We know therapy needs to be motivating for children in general, and games are particularly motivating for children with autism because they’re visually appealing. ‘Autistic children aren't motivated by wanting to please in the same way other children are. ‘Non-autistic children think ‘this lady wants me to play this game and if I do, she'll say well done,' but autistic children aren’t interested in that at all. 'They need to be motivated in other ways - and technology helps with this.' Autistic children typically have visual ways of communicating, and as a result have a visual way of learning and this is why apps are so effective, Ms Walton concluded. In a recent study, researchers from . Canada studied 12 children in six classrooms across Ontario, all of whom . have non-verbal autism spectrum disorder. These classrooms were given Apple iPads for a six-month trial. Following . the experiment, nine of the students showed a statistical improvement . ranging from mild to significant in their overall communication skills. The . devices were also found to boost motivation among 75 per cent of the . children, while also increasing their attention span and ability to . interact socially. Topcliffe . Primary School in Birmingham recently introduced touchscreen devices . into classrooms and similarly noticed an improvement among the autistic . students. ‘We watched . children with autism playing with the images on the screen in ways in . which none of the typically developing children had done, said . Topcliffe’s spectrum disorders teacher Sarah Quickenden. ‘The normal curriculum that we were offering just wasn't allowing them to demonstrate these skills to us. We never realised that the children had these skills because some of them are so locked in.’","The app was developed by Samsung with doctors in South Korea .

"Syria was once famed for its spectacular heritage sites, but new satellite imagery shows at least 290 cultural monuments have been destroyed or damaged since the outbreak of war in 2011. Syria is home to archaeological treasures that span thousands of years of written history, from the Roman ruins in the desert oasis of Palmyra to the towering Crusader castle known as the Crac des Chevaliers near the Mediterranean coast. The nation's capital, Damascus, is also one of the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world. As evidence emerges of the extent of the devastation caused by the civil war, experts also claim ancient treasures dating back three millennia have been plundered and are being sold on the British black market and eBay to fund Islamic State terrorists. Scroll down for video . The UN agency released close-ups of satellite-detected images of the shrine of Uwais al-Qurani and Ammar bin Yasser in the Syrian city of Raqa, showing how whole buildings have been flattened during the conflict . The historic heart of the northern Syrian city of Aleppo has also been destroyed in large parts by ongoing shelling since the conflict first broke out in 2011 . These satellite images reveal the scale of destruction that Isis looters continue to inflict on archaeological sites within the Syrian warzone to turn a profit and buy weapons. Classical-period site Dura Europos in eastern Syria, which was founded in the third century BC and boasts one of the world's earliest churches, is one of dozens of sites now covered in looters' pits. Valuable artefacts such as Roman busts are now being touted in Britain and the US and a Hellenistic coin collection from Syria has even appeared on eBay, according to experts. Christopher Marinello, who founded Art Recovery International, said: ‘We have seen a great deal of evidence of ancient Syrian artefacts making their way into the UK and the US,’ he said. ‘Recently a middle-man approached me with a catalogue of important objects we believe were taken from sites within the Syrian war zone. Some with evidence of dirt still on them were being offered for sale. 'Any respected dealers should not touch them, as dealing in looted works from war zones could directly fund terrorism. ‘We feel that Syria has potential for the worst looting we have ever witnessed and it represents the biggest cultural threat since the Second World War.’ Syrian archaeologist Amr Al Azm said he recently saw coins dating from 121BC, believed to have been smuggled from Syria, being sold on eBay with a guide price of £73. ‘The advert said the coins came with some original find dirt, which was a real give away,’ said the professor of Middle East history at Shawnee State University, Ohio. ‘These types of objects are now starting to appear much more online, especially on the dark net.’ Unitar also provided satellite images of Necropolis, in the ancient oasis city of Palmyra, showing how it had changed between 2009 and 2014 . The archaeological site of Dura-Europos near the western Syrian village of Salhieh on September 4, 2011 (L) and on on April 2, 2014 (R) appears to show significant damage to the landscape as a result of the war . A picture taken on March 14, 2014, shows the courtyard of the sanctury of Baal in the ancient oasis city of Palmyra, an ancient Aramaic city in central Syria . Rebel fighters fire machine guns on the frontline during the battle against pro-government forces for control of the Handarat region, just north of Aleppo . Ancient treasures  have been plundered from Syrian sites inlcuding in Palmyra, northeast of Damascus (pictured with a Syrian policeman) and are being sold on the British black market and eBay . Looters tasked by Isis have sunk several large pits in the ancient Mesopotamian city Mari, eastern Syria, which dates back to 2900 BC. They have destroyed key structures within the famous 'palace of Zimri-lim', which was stormed by Hammurabi of Babylon in the mid-18th century BC. ‘The situation is much more critical now particularly in areas under the control of Isis,' said Professor Al Azm, who is part of a group that monitors the scale of looting using satellite imagery and undercover activists on the ground. 'It is now becoming a lucrative enough enterprise for them to kill to preserve it. ‘At first when Isis entered these areas, they sanctioned the plundering of ancient sites as long as they were given a percentage and this encouraged more people to dig up the sites. ‘But now Isis has started to bring in its own contractors. They are using heavy machinery and bulldozers to excavate, destroying these important sites. ‘The cultural heritage of Syria is being pillaged at an ever-accelerating rate. To see it destroyed like this for the sake of profit is very upsetting and distressing. ‘When you destroy this cultural heritage and the shared past, then you also destroy any chance of a future.’ The renowned Crusader castle Krak des Chevaliers near the Syria-Lebanon border has also been damaged extensively in the conflict . The minaret of a famed 12th century Umayyad mosque is shown before it was destroyed by shelling in the northern city of Aleppo . More than 80 archaeologists and scholars from around the world have signed an open letter calling on the United Nations Security Council to ban illicit trade in Syrian antiquities. Edouard Planche from UNESCO’s Culture Sector is supporting the ban and said he was calling upon those in the arts market to not trade in Syrian antiquities as it could fund terrorism. Richard Ellis, who set up Scotland Yard's Art and Antiquities Squad, said many valuable objects are going into vaults in Zurich and Geneva where they will be held for several years. ‘I’ve seen reports of increased objects entering the US market and that is probably because they monitor the input so rigorously. ‘At the moment if artefacts enter the British market, they will be the everyday items. The important objects such as the mosaic floors we will only start seeing in 10 or 15 years time after the conflict. ‘In Britain the policing of illicit trade in antiquities is totally inadequate. There are a maximum of four officers covering that type of crime, so they are very stretched.’ A new report by the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (Unitar) has revealed the extent to which some of the world's most historic sites have been damaged. It has long been known that Syria's archaeological sites have been looted and its historic buildings damaged since the country's conflict began in March 2011. However, analysing satellite images of 18 cultural areas, Unitar determined that 24 sites were totally destroyed, another 104 sites were severely damaged, 85 moderately damaged and 77 possibly damaged. The 12th century Krak des Chevaliers castle is among the nearly 300 cultural sites that have been damaged by the ongoing violence in the country . The ancient oasis city of Palmyra,  northeast of Damascus, is considered one of Syria's most important cultural sites . The evidence provides 'alarming testimony of the ongoing damage that is happening to Syria's vast cultural heritage', Unitar said. 'National and international efforts for the protection of these areas need to be scaled up in order to save as much as possible of this important heritage to human-kind.' Unesco World Heritage sites in Aleppo, Damascus, Palmyra and the Crac des Chevaliers have all sustained major damage, according to Unitar. Sites across the country have been exposed to different threats. In some places, shelling and other military activity are responsible for the destruction, while in other places illegal excavations and civilian construction are to blame. The report offers before and after photographs from several sites that indicate the scale of the loss. Photos of Aleppo show grey craters and mounds of rubble around the city's famed citadel where historic buildings, including the Carlton hotel, used to be. Heavy damage is also evident to the Umayyad Mosque, which has lost its 11th-century minaret. Images from the ancient city of Dura-Europos and Palmyra show extensive looting, with the ground peppered with holes from unauthorised digging. A Home Office spokesman said that Border Force had not come into contact with any items from Syria, while eBay said: 'We provide guidance to eBay sellers in our Help section to make sure that any artefacts they may try to sell comply with the guidelines issued by the authorities, and are always ready and willing to investigate any listings causing concern. 'We work with experts and will remove items from sale based on their advice.'","New satellite images show extensive damage to most treasured sites .

"Despite claims Apple’s 16GB phones barely have enough storage for all the pre-installed software and apps, let alone a user’s files, the company continues to sell it as an entry-level model. But, rather than being a short-sighted move, one analyst believes it is a calculated strategy designed to get people to buy larger devices as soon as possible. In fact, Neil Cybart claims Apple makes an extra $3 billion (£1.9 billion) each year by not doubling the amount of minimum storage every time a new model is released. California-based analyst Neil Cybart has studied Apple’s iPhone storage strategy and believes that by limiting storage on entry-level phones, customers are more likely to upgrade to a larger, more expensive, device the following year. This ultimately makes the firm an extra $3billion (£1.9 billion) each year . ‘Apple's decision to keep the entry-level storage tier at 16GB for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, despite doubling the other capacities to 64GB and 128GB, continues to raise eyebrows,’ explained analyst Neil Cybart on his Above Avalon site. ‘Apple's near-term motive behind keeping the 16GB capacity option is pretty clear: get people to buy the 64GB option.’ But, as Mr Cybart explained, Apple’s strategy is more complex, and forward-thinking than that. He believes that by limiting the amount of storage on entry-level phones, in what he calls the ‘lower tier’, customers will eventually upgrade to a larger device, in the middle tier, the following year. These customers are then more likely to then stay in the middle tier, or in some cases move to the upper tier, but are unlikely to downgrade to less storage. Apple offers the iPhone 6 Plus (left) and iPhone 6 (right) in 16GB, 64GB and 128GB models . By limiting the amount of storage on entry-level phones, in the ‘lower tier’, customers will eventually upgrade to a larger device, in the middle tier, the following year. These customers are more likely to then stay in the middle tier, or in some cases move to the upper tier, but are unlikely to downgrade to less storage. This trend is even more common if Apple keeps the entry-level the same, but boosts the storage by three times or more in the following year. However, if Apple doubles the amount of storage on the entry-level model each year, people upgrade but stay in the lower tier. All of these figures are taken from Neil Cybart's Above Avalon site. In year one, Apple offers a 16GB, 32GB and 64GB model and the customer buys the 16GB version. The following year, Apple offers 16GB, 64GB and 128GB models. The current iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are available in these sizes, for example. This prompts the user to either stay the same, or upgrade to 64GB in year two. This 64GB costs more than the 32GB version did the previous year. By the third year, Apple can offer 32GB as an entry-level model, but the customer won’t downgrade storage and stays with the 64GB as a minimum. In year one, Apple offers a 16GB, 32GB and 64GB model and the customer buys the 16GB version.The following year, Apple offers 16GB, 64GB and 128GB models. This prompts the user to either stay the same, or upgrade to 64GB in year two. This 64GB costs more than the 32GB version did the previous year . Example 2 . Alternatively, if Apple offers an entry-level 16GB one year, but then increases this lower tier storage the year after to 32GB, the customer may upgrade to a phone with larger storage, but they’re still technically buying the entry-level model. And so on into year three, if Apple offers 64GB as a minimum. This means they spend less money each year, and Apple can't move customers from the lower to the middle or higher tiers. Alternatively, if Apple offers an entry-level 16GB one year, but then increases this lower tier storage the year after to 32GB, the customer may upgrade to a phone with larger storage, but they’re still technically buying the entry-level model . This trend is even more common if Apple keeps the entry-level the same, but boosts the storage by three times or more in the middle tier, the following year. However, if Apple doubles the amount of storage on the entry-level model each year, people upgrade but will always stay in the lower tier. For example, in year one, Apple offers a 16GB, 32GB and 64GB model and the customer buys the 16GB version. However, if Apple doubles the amount of storage on the entry-level model each year, people upgrade but stay in the lower tier. According to Mr Cybart's calculations, Apple's middle tier strategy makes Apple $47 billion (£30 billion) a year. But the lower tier strategy makes $44 billion (£28 billion) In January, Which? magazine tested the eight most popular 16GB handsets from Samsung, Apple, BlackBerry, LG, HTC and Google, pictured. Samsung's Galaxy S4 was the worst performing handset, with only 54% (8.56GB) of available storage, while Apple's iPhone 5C was the best, with 79% (12.6GB) The following year, Apple offers 16GB, 64GB and 128GB models. This prompts the user to either stay the same, or upgrade to 64GB in year two at a higher premium than the 32GB cost the previous year. By the third year, Apple can offer 32GB as an entry-level model, but the customer won’t downgrade storage and stays with the 64GB as a minimum. Alternatively, if Apple offers an entry-level 16GB one year, but then increases this lower tier storage the year after to 32GB, the customer may upgrade to a phone with larger storage, but they’re still technically buying the entry-level model. According to Mr Cybart's calculations, the middle tier strategy makes Apple $47 billion (£30 billion) a year. But the lower tier strategy makes $44 billion (£28 billion). This is a difference of $3 billion (£1.9 billion). Mr Cybart claims that this difference is based on Apple charging an average $20 (£13) more for the handsets year-on-year. If Apple charged more, the difference would be greater. And so on into year three, if Apple offers 64GB as a minimum. Mr Cybart also worked out how much revenue Apple makes by keeping the 16GB model as a minimum, and using the middle tier strategy. According to his calculations, the middle tier strategy makes Apple $47 billion (£30 billion) a year. But the lower tier strategy makes $44 billion (£28 billion) - a difference of $3 billion (£1.9 billion), simply by charging an average $20 (£13) for the handsets. ‘By doubling the middle tier storage capacity to 64GB, while maintaining the price, and keeping the 16GB storage capacity at the bottom tier, I estimate that approximately 30 per cent of previous 16GB iPhone owners will upgrade to 64GB to take advantage of the better deal,’ continued Mr Cybart. ‘While some may say this discussion profitability is anti-consumer, observers need to look at this process as a bit more than just greed. ‘A case can be made that Apple is looking to get users dependent on higher storage, by carefully guiding customers into a particular iPhone model each year.’ In January, Which? magazine tested the eight most popular 16GB handsets from Samsung, Apple, BlackBerry, LG, HTC and Google, pictured. Samsung's Galaxy S4 was the worst performing handset, with only 54% (8.56GB) of available storage, while Apple's iPhone 5C was the best, with 79% (12.6GB). The iPhone 6 16GB has a similar amount of storage as the iPhone 5S, at 12.2GB, which has been dubbed 'inadequate' by users.","Analyst Neil Cybart has studied Apple’s iPhone storage strategy .

"We know Botox can hide frown lines, prevent migraines and even ease excessive perspiration. Now women are requesting off-label use of the injectable to help prolong their blow-outs. According to Yahoo Beauty, the procedure is becoming popular with some women 'so they can attend SoulCycle without getting their hair sweaty.' Top New York dermatologist Dr Patricia Wexler says the improved hair quality is a benefit of Botox's effect on the sweat glands. An extreme solution to frizz-free hair? Botox is now being injected into the scalp in order that patients can have longer-lasting blow-dries . 'It works exactly like injections for hyperhidrosis,' she tells Dailymail.com. '[Botox] inhibits the eccrine glands specifically.' The result of reduced scalp perspiration is that a patient may experience less frizz and not have to wash their hair as frequently. Dr Wexler says that while the cost of the procedure can be 'prohibitive', she would recommend it if asked. 'It has few side effects if given in a safe dilution and dose,' she explains. 'It should be discriminately placed along the hairline and frontal area where frizz is most prominent.' Yahoo reports that one would need over 100 units of Botox to treat an entire scalp and the effects would last three months. But Dr Wexler says she would not advise the use of Botox on the whole head as it 'would not be practical from a cost or safety profile.' While she has never injected an entire scalp, dermatologist Dr Francesca Fusco tells Yahoo that 'several women whose foreheads I have injected happily report decreased sweating at the hairline and temples.' But dermatologist Dr Neal Schultz argues that the procedure is painful, expensive and not effective enough to be worth the patient's while. He explains to Yahoo that only injecting the hairline will not prevent sweat on other areas of the scalp, so the rest of one's hair will likely still frizz or fall limp from sweat after a workout. What's more, the thicker skin on the scalp means that Botox injections in that area will hurt more than those on the face, where the skin is thinner. 'The cost/benefit ratio isn't going to make sense, considering the lack of ability to stop enough sweating to make a real difference,' he said.","Dermatologist Dr Patricia Wexler says improved hair quality is a benefit of Botox's effect on the sweat glands .

"North Korea's internet connection has been cut for the second day in a row today, says a US Internet Research group tracking the country's connectivity. According to Dry Research, North Korea's four networks supplied by the Chinese company China Unicorn were offline at 1541 GMT on Tuesday , reports AFP. North Korea also lost internet connection for more than nine hours on Monday leading some to believe the US might be behind a cyber-attack in retaliation for the hack of Sony Pictures. Lost internet: North Korea's and leader Kim Jong Un's (pictured) internet connection has been cut for the second day in a row today, says a US Internet Research group tracking the country's connectivity . North Korea, led by Kim Jong Un (right), suffered one of its worst ever internet outages just days after U.S. President Barack Obama (left) warned of a 'proportional response' to the Sony hacking . US Officials have blamed North Korea for the Sony Pictures hack and President Obama promised a 'proportionate response' to the alleged hack of the Hollywood film company. The US has not come forward about the North Korean internet outage but online experts say that it resembles a 'denial of service' attack. The US State Department suggested on Monday that America may be behind the virtual attack on North Korea Yesterday. Very few people in the country have access to the internet, with connections often failing. However, the continuous problems reportedly being experienced led experts to raise the possibility that it might be under a cyber attack. Deputy State Department Spokeswoman Marie Harf reminded a reporter on Monday of Obama's threat to take action against North Korea while responding to a general question about the possibility that the country was undergoing a cyber assault . A spokesperson for State lent credence to the theory on Monday when she reminded a reporter of Obama's threat while responding to a general question about the possibility that North Korea was undergoing a cyber assault. 'As the president said, we are considering a range of options in response,' deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said. 'We aren’t going to discuss, publicly, operational details about the possible response options — or comment on those types of reports in any way — except to say that as we implement those responses some will be seen, some may not be seen.' She added, 'So I can’t confirm those reports, but in general, that’s what the president has spoken to.' For nine hours on Monday, the hermit regime went completely offline. 'It's as if North Korea got erased from the global map of the Internet,' Matthew Prince, president of internet security company CloudFlare, told CNN. The outage followed President Obama's public shaming of North Korea on Friday after the U.S. government definitively determined that it was behind the hacking of computers at Sony Pictures over the studio's new film, The Interview, which depicts the assassination of North Korea leader Kim Jong Un. Doug Madory, director of Internet analysis at Dyn Research, said the internet connectivity problems were discovered in the last 24 hours and had gotten progressively worse to the point that 'North Korea's totally down.' Internet connection was restored after nine hours on Monday but on . Madory said one benign explanation for the problem might be that a router suffered a software glitch, though a cyber-attack involving North Korea's Internet service was also a possibility. 'I haven't seen such a steady beat of routing instability and outages in KP before,' he told North Korea Tech. 'Usually there are isolated blips, not continuous connectivity problems. I wouldn't be surprised if they are absorbing some sort of attack presently.' The outage comes just days after President Obama's public shaming of North Korea after the U.S. government definitively determined that it was behind the hacking of computers at Sony Pictures . Although very few citizens in North Korea have access to the internet, it allows the country's state media to link to the outside world. The communist state's internet access is wired through China, which today, in a foreign ministry statement, said it 'opposes cyber attacks and cyber terrorism in all of its forms,' without referring directly to its ally North Korea. The instability is in North Korea's main link, which runs through the northern Chinese city of Shenyang. Madory said this applied to North Korea's main Internet connection via Chinese company China Unicom, although it was possible the country had limited connection via satellite. 'All I can say is that in the last 24 hours, their communications have been degraded to a point where they are unable to communicate,' he said. 'They have disappeared from the global Internet presently.' Dyn Research monitors Internet performance though live feeds of router tables from about 450 telecommunications providers worldwide. Madory said North Korea's Internet connection has historically been stable, although it has come under attack in the past, including during a period of high tension with South Korea in 2013. He said there were a lot of players - including potentially teenage hackers - who could mount a 'distributed denial-of-service' cyber attack on North Korea, if this were the cause of the outages. 'It doesn't need to be some big nation state,' he added. Another Internet technology service, Arbor Networks, which protects companies against hacker attacks, said its monitoring had detected denial-of-service attacks aimed at North Korea's infrastructure, which started on Saturday and continued into today. Such attacks transmit so much spurious data traffic to Internet equipment that it becomes overwhelmed, until the attacks stop or the spurious traffic can be filtered and discarded to allow normal connections to resume. Washington has accused Pyongyang of being behind the hack that led to the release of embarrassing company emails and caused Sony executives to halt the debut of the comedy action film 'The Interview' It is not immediately clear if the connectivity problems were an act of retribution for the hack that the FBI last week linked to North Korea. Distributed denial-of-service attacks are a relatively unsophisticated type of cyber warfare, in which a targeted computer system is bombarded with traffic, rendering it temporarily useless. Asked about the internet problems, North Korean diplomat Kim Song, said: 'I have no information.' Washington has accused Pyongyang of being behind the hack that led to the release of embarrassing company emails and caused Sony executives to halt the debut of the The Interview. According to the FBI, there is 'significant overlap' between the Sony Pictures attack and other 'malicious cyber-activity' with direct links to Pyongyang, including an attack last year on South Korean banks blamed on the North. The hackers behind the attack on Sony Pictures said they were incensed by the comedy, and the studio pulled the film from distribution after major U.S. cinema chains declined to exhibit it. The film about a fictional CIA plot to kill the country's leader infuriated North Korea, although Pyongyang has repeatedly denied it was behind the cyber assault. Despite calls from Republican critics for a robust response to the alleged hack, Obama told CNN in an interview that aired on Sunday: 'I don't think it was an act of war. I think it was an act of cyber vandalism that was very costly, very expensive. We take it very seriously.' He also promised to 'review' the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism and potentially re-add North Korea, but added: 'We've got very clear criteria as to what it means for a state to sponsor terrorism. And we don't make those judgments just based on the news of the day.' The White House declined to comment today and Harf refused to confirm or deny that North Korea had lost internet access because of a cyber attack. North Korea has threatened to hit back at the White House and other U.S. targets if it was sanctioned over the alleged hacking. Today Harf said of those threats: 'We have no specific credible threat information that leads credence to these reports.' 'Obviously, we take very seriously any threats to U.S. citizens, to U.S. companies, regardless of what that threat looks like.' North Korea's National Defense Commission, in a statement on the official news agency, said the country's army and people 'are fully ready to stand in confrontation with the US in all war spaces including cyber warfare space to blow up those citadels.' Meanwhile, South's Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power Co (KHNP) began conducting drills at its four nuclear plant complexes today after a series of online information leaks by a suspected hacker. The hacker, using an account entitled 'president of the anti-nuclear reactor group', published a variety of information on Twitter, including designs and manuals for two reactors as well as personal information on some 10,000 KHNP employees. There did not appear to be any link between the drill and the Sony Pictures hack, and North Korea says it has never attempted or made a cyber attack on South Korea.","Continuous problems today and for nine hours yesterday yesterday could mean North Korea was under cyber attack .

"2014 has been Quvenzhané Wallis's year - the actress has been revealed as the face of Armani Junior for a second time. The 11-year-old poses in a stripey dress for the advert photo, jumping playfully for the camera. The star is an experienced hand at wearing the designer's clothing now - as well as an ad campaign last spring, where she was pictured wearing a tuxedo, Quvenzhané has also worn Giorgio Armani on the red carpet at awards ceremonies and premieres. She told the Hollywood Reporter earlier this year that she was honoured to be chosen as an Armani fashion ambassador, saying: 'I was honored to wear his custom gown to the Oscars, it made me feel like a princess. 'When I saw Mr. Armani's Prive show in New York, the dresses were so pretty... I had too many favorites. Afterwards when I met him, I realized Mr Armani is such a nice man. I liked that that he was so thoughtful. 'It's fun to wear Armani Junior since I really like the clothes. It's young. It's cool. My friends are going to want to borrow all my clothes.' Quvenzhané is well on her way to becoming a screen legend. The 11-year-old star, who is the youngest Academy Award Best Actress nominee, recently chatted with Elle magazine about her role as Little Orphan Annie in the updated film adaptation of the classic story. Also in the January issue of the publication, the Beasts Of The Southern Wild actress grappled with the inevitable reality that she won't be a child forever. Bright future ahead: Quvenzhané Wallis is featured in the pages of the January issue of Elle magazine . 'I don't want to grow up, but I know it's not going to last much longer,' she revealed. Many critics have dubbed Quvenzhané as the next leading child actor and she is surely proving them right. But the young starlet admitted she has moments where she just wants to act like a kid. 'I feel like I'm five sometimes, because I still enjoy myself,' she said. 'I enjoy what I do.' Rising star: The 11-year-old Academy Award nominee admitted during the interview: 'I don't want to grow up, but I know it's not going to last much longer' Spoken like a veteran actress she explained: 'I just keep doing what I'm doing and don't ever give up. That's what I like about Annie. If she has goals, she'll finish them, like me. We're both confident.' And that confidence is what landed her the leading role of the film. Originally, Will and Jada Pinkett Smith signed on as producers for Annie with plans of their 14-year-old daughter Willow to play the role of the orphan girl, but director Will Gluck had other ideas. Right up her alley: The Beasts Of The Southern Wild actress landed the role of Annie in the latest film adaptation of the classic story about a little orphan girl . Not-so hard knock life: Quvenzhané, pictured at the London photocall for the film, beat out Willow Smith for the lead part . The initial requirements Gluck was looking for in the leading lady were: 'Someone close to Annie's actual age, 11; someone plucky, smart, and on the hustle; and someone 50 per cent hardened and 50 per cent endlessly generous with their heart - two things that don't often go together.' '[Quvenzhané] was dropped down from heaven,' he gushed to Elle about casting her in the film. 'She has a face that can do anything.' The apparent difference between the past Annie adaptations is that the lead is a Caucasian young woman, however Gluck knew that Quvenzhané was destined to play the part. Adding: 'We just wanted a modern girl. And when you see the movie, it's not about her race. It's just about a headstrong girl who cares about everyone around her. And that's Quvenzhané.' On her way to legendary stardom: The star's role in Annie has nabbed her multiple nominations including a NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress, Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Young Actress and Golden Globe Award for Best Actress . Gluck wasn't the only one blown away by Quvenzhané's amazing acting abilities, actor Jamie Foxx, her on-screen father Will Stacks, present day 'Daddy' Warbucks, thought so too. 'She brought so much talent and charisma to set,' he proudly told Elle. 'Quvenzhané was made to play this role. I'm convinced it was in her DNA,' he added. Meant to be: Jamie Foxx gushed about his on-screen daughter's acting abilities telling Elle: 'Quvenzhané was made to play this role. I'm convinced it was in her DNA' Father-daughter pair: The duo posed together for photographers at the photocall in London . Her role in Annie has nabbed her multiple nominations including a NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress, Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Young Actress and Golden Globe Award for Best Actress. Quvenzhané will compete against veteran actors Amy Adams (Big Eyes), Emily Blunt (Into The Woods), Helen Mirren (The Hundred-Foot Journey) and Julianne Moore (Maps To The Stars) at the January 11 Golden Globe ceremony, .

"It is a common topic around the festive dinner table - memories of perfect white  Christmases of the past. However, US Government forecasters have revealed that in fact, they are actually far more common in recent years. The map they created reveals that only in a few areas (marked in brown) actually had more white Christmases in the past. The map shows the percent change in snow-covered days over the week of Christmas between 1990 to 2013 and 1966 to 1989. The colour blue indicates areas where the ground was more frequently snow-covered in recent years. Brown indicates areas where Christmases in longer-ago decades were indeed whiter. The map below shows the percent change in snow-covered days over the week of Christmas between 1990 to 2013 and 1966 to 1989. Places where the ground was snow-covered up to 25 per cent more frequently in recent decades are coloured in shades of blue, and places that were snow-covered up to 25 per cent less frequently are coloured shades of brown. The colour blue indicates areas where the ground was more frequently snow-covered in recent years, and . The map below shows the percent change in snow-covered days over the week of Christmas between 1990 to 2013 and 1966 to 1989. 'Many of us wondered whether we could trust our memories of how snowy the holidays were when we were kids compared to now,' the Goverment's climate team wrote. 'Just for fun, we asked the experts at the Rutgers Snow Lab to show us what their data (based on NOAA satellite images) had to say about whether the U.S. snow extent during the week of Christmas has changed at all in the past 50 years. 'As you can see, fans of glistening tree tops have had a better time in the past few years - there seem to have been more white Christmases between 1990 to 2013 in the U.S.' Places where the ground was snow-covered up to 25 per cent more frequently in recent decades are coloured in shades of blue, and places that were snow-covered up to 25 per cent less frequently are coloured shades of brown. According to the Rutgers, there has been a modest increase in snow extent during the holiday week today compared to the past for the country as a whole, although it clearly varies a lot from place to place. Further, the scientists emphasize, singling out a particular winter week for scrutiny isn’t especially meaningful as an indicator of long-term climate change. there seem to have been more white Christmases between 1990 to 2013 than between 1966 to 1989 in the U.S . When it comes to meaningful indicators of how snow has changed over time, the scientists say, it’s best to stick to monthly or seasonal averages. By those indicators, says David Robinson, who leads the Rutgers snow lab project, the pattern is clear: Northern Hemisphere snow cover is declining significantly at the end of the cold season (spring/early summer). This pattern of snow disappearing earlier in the spring makes intuitive sense with respect to global warming. As temperatures rise, the impact on snow cover is likely to show up first in those seasons where the temperature is just barely cold enough for snow. Reductions in snow can also feed back on the atmosphere, amplifying warming. Where winter temperatures are well below freezing, however, temperatures will have to rise more significantly before snow cover is affected.","Chart shows how a white Christmas has changed over time .

"Senators, beware. There's a new majority leader in town come January, and he's not afraid of long work weeks and late nights, if that's what it takes to avoid another 'do-nothing' Congress. Long gone are the days of political showdowns that hold up critical bills and common sense legislation, says the incoming Senate leader, Kentucky Republican Mitch McConnell. 'It was not about legislation. It had nothing to do with an outcome. The Senate basically didn’t do squat for years,' he told the New York Times, chastising his Democratic predecessor Harry Reid. 'I don’t think most members of the Senate wanted it run that way.' Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell,  pictured here during an interview at the U.S. Capitol last week, has vowed not to run the upper chamber like his predecessor, Nevada Sen. Harry Reid. The previous way of doing business 'was designed to make us walk the plank. It had nothing to do with getting a legislative outcome,' he said. But it's not just Democrats who will have to get in line, McConnell says. His own caucus will have to shed its reputation as the party of 'no' if the GOP is to successfully move its agenda and retain its position of authority. 'One of my challenges is to try to convince some of my members that passing an appropriations bill is a good thing, not a bad thing,' he told the Times. 'Many of my members are not used to voting for appropriations bills. But if we are going to pursue our agenda to push back against the bureaucratic overreach seemingly on steroids for the last five or six years, we need to put appropriations bills on the president’s desk and make him make a choice,' he said. Republicans will also have to play follow the leader more often now that they're in the majority, McConnell said, and stop holding up the legislative process until they can bend it to their will. 'There are two kinds of people in politics,' McConnell said. 'Those who want to make a point and those who want to make a difference. 'All of us from time to time make a point,' he noted. 'But it is time now to make a difference.' Perceptions of the 113th Congress as the do-nothing legislature aren't wrong. According to an analysis of congressional data conducted by the Associated Press, with just over 200 bills signed into law, the current Congress was the least productive body since the one that concluded in 1948. Labeled by then-President Harry Truman as the 'do-nothing Congress,' that legislature oversaw the creation of 900 laws. 'We have a president who was facing a headwind, Republicans opposing him in Congress and a decline in popularity. Republicans saw no reason to give us any legislative help,' Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, his party's No. 2 leader, told the Associated Press. The conservative and libertarian wings of the Republican Party have argued regularly over the past two years that given the choice between no new laws and laws that advance Democratic interests, including new regulatory guidelines and rules they perceive as restricting Americans' rights and freedoms, the fewer laws the better. But if Republicans continue to threaten government shutdowns when they don't get their way and constantly play the role of contrarian, the party risks losing its majorities in both the House and the Senate - and the office of the president in 2016. Americans may decide they want a united, functional government, regardless of what type of laws it produces. McConnell will have to walk a fine line between keeping the upper chamber on task and stifling debate, however. To that end, he's promised several times since the November elections that catapulted the GOP into power that he will allow a free-flowing discussion on the Senate floor, unlike previous leader Reid, who would often prohibit amendments he didn't like from undergoing debate. He's also committed to keeping the Senate in session longer by reestablishing a five-day work week that forces members to stick around on Friday instead of starting their weekend early. 'It will more chaotic, there will probably be later nights,' McConnell told the Times. 'The goal is to let the Senate express its views.' An ecstatic-looking Mitch McConnell celebrates with supporters on Election Day, Tuesday, Nov. 4, after learning that he'd won reelection to his own Senate seat and that his party had won a majority of seats in the legislative body, putting him first in line to be the Senate's top dog . The strategy is meant to pacify both progressive and conservative firebrands and give them ample opportunity to make their views known without sending the Senate into overtime, as it did earlier this month when right-wing Sens. Ted Cruz and Mike Lee took to the floor on a Friday evening to demand a vote on President Barack Obama's immigration orders. Cruz says they were promised a vote before the Senate adjourned for the weekend but did not receive it. The move infuriated Reid, and he left the Senate in session through Saturday out of spite and used the time to force through presidential nominees whose confirmations had been stalled. At a closed-door party luncheon the following week during the Senate's final days in session before closing up shop for the holidays, Cruz begged pardon from fellow Republicans whose weekends he'd just ruined. 'Yes, the senator acknowledged that a number of his colleagues had to unexpectedly change their weekend plans, and he apologized to them for inconveniencing their personal schedules. That was not his intention,' Cruz's spokeswoman Catherine Frazier confirmed to Politico. 'His intention was to secure a vote on President Obama’s illegal executive amnesty, and to use every procedural means to do so,' she explained. McConnell refused to comment to reporters on the events that transpired but made it clear he wouldn't manage the Senate the way Democrats did in the previous eight years. The most recent legislative session was all about 'how many times did we have the point of the week?' he told the Associated Press. 'It was designed to make us walk the plank. It had nothing to do with getting a legislative outcome.' McConnell has promised several times since the November elections that catapulted the GOP into power that he will allow a free-flowing discussion on the Senate floor, unlike previous leader Harry Reid, pictured, who would often prohibit amendments he didn't like from undergoing debate . Finally in the seat of power, McConnell is ready to get down to business on Jan. 5 when the new Congress convenes, and he and House Speaker John Boehner already have a list of legislative priorities ironed out for the first six weeks. 'I have studied this job and reached my own conclusions about how it ought to be done,' McConnell told the Times. 'It has been a long wait.' First up is legislation approving the Keystone XL pipeline. A similar effort to authorize the final section of the transnational oil transportation system died in the Senate earlier this month, even though it had the support of 14 Democratic senators in addition to the chamber's 45 Republicans, and the GOP believes that next year it will have enough votes to send a bill to the president's desk. Also atop of the to-do list is passing legislation to repeal Obamacare. While the bill will likely receive widespread support in both legislative bodies, it has no chance of becoming law, as the president has already said he will issue a rare veto to keep his signature law in place. Republicans may find more success in taking a piecemeal approach to dismantling and reforming the health care law, particularly if they focus on areas that Democrats have also levied complaints at. McConnell has indicated that if their preferred approach to taking down Obamacare fails, they'll take that tact. The House and Senate also likely to take up bills that introduce changes to the tax code, promote trade and boost infrastructure spending at the request of the president, who has argued that he'll be more likely to work with Congress if they're make a good faith effort to work with him.","It's not just Democrats who will have to get in line, Sen. Mitch McConnell says; the GOP will have to shed its reputation as the party of 'no'

"A newly discovered species of beetle has been named in honour of TV naturalist, Sir David Attenborough.

It was one of 98 other new species of this particular beetle genus discovered by German scientists on Indonesia, according to the report published in the open access journal ZooKeys. Researchers identified the new species by taking a part of the beetle's DNA to sequence. Trigonopterus attenboroughi is reddish-brown in colour and measures up to 0.1-inch (2.63mm) in length. Alexander Riedel, the researcher who discovered the Trigonopterus attenboroughi, said naming the latest find after Sir David Attenborough was an easy decision. He got the idea when he was watching Life on Earth with his daughter. Discovery: Trigonopterus attenboroughi was one of 98 other new species of the beetle genus discovered by German scientists on Indonesia, according to the report, published in the open access journal ZooKeys . 'It was surprising that in Bali even areas regularly visited by package tours can be the home of unknown species,' said Dr Riedel from the Natural History Museum in Karlsruhe, Germany. 'It was a challenge to find suitable names for so many new species. Scaptia beyonceae: Beyoncé horse fly . Avahi cleesei: John Cleese lemur . Nepenthes Helen: Meat-eating jungle plant named after Helen Mirren . Hyloscirtus princecharlesi: Prince Charles stream tree frog . Gnathia marleyi: Bob Marley fish feeding parasite .

Aptostichus angelinajolieae: Angelina Jolie trapdoor spider . Agathidium bushi: George Bush beetle . Loureedia annulipes: Velvet spider that pays tribute to Lou Reed . Dawkinsia filamentosa: Fish named after Richard Dawkins . 'Some could be based on their respective localities; others were named by the Indonesian numbers one to 12; however, the easiest choice was to name one for Sir David Attenborough in recognition of his outstanding documentaries on natural history. 'It can be hoped that the documentation of nature´s beauty finally leads to an effective protection of this heritage.' Doctor Yayuk Suhardjono, of the Indonesian Research Centre of Biology, added: 'Many of these species are restricted to small areas; sometimes they are found only in a single locality. 'These beetles are wingless and usually stay for millions of years where they are. 'This makes them extremely vulnerable to changes of their habitat.' In 2012, a tiny species of Goblin Spider, Prethopalpus attenborough, found on an island off Australia was named after Sir David Attenborough. Just two years earlier, Sir Attenborough was the inspiration for naming a flesh-eating pitcher plant that was able to swallow rats whole.

"Strengthen security: John Roth, Homeland Security Inspector General, says the Secret Service has 'refused to comply with mandated computer security policies' and that they must in order to keep the country safe . The U.S. Secret Service refused to provide data on its computer security systems to the Department of Homeland Security in 2014, preventing it from being able to verify if it was complying with security policies, an inspector general's report said on Monday. The service, which has faced withering criticism after several security lapses including a White House breach in September, 'refused to comply with mandated computer security policies' according to the report by the DHS inspector general. The review also said DHS agencies were not doing enough to protect computer systems from such high-risk bugs as Heartbleed, which allowed hackers to spy on computers but not take control of them. The report said FEMA and the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service still use the Microsoft Windows XP operating system, which may be vulnerable to hackers and that Microsoft stopped providing software updates for in April.

"A father is about to celebrate his 'first' Christmas, after a brutal assault wiped his memory of the first 49 years of his life. Andy Wickens, 50, was left with amnesia after he intervened in a fight outside his home. Mr Wickens, from Burgess Hill, West Sussex, was punched in the face and knocked unconscious when his head hit the pavement. When he came around he could not remember getting married to his wife Petrina and did not recognise their three-year-old son, Jenson. Andy Wickens, (right), 50, was knocked unconscious when he intervened in a fight outside his home, and when he woke up he had lost his memory. He couldn't remember his wife Petrina  43, (left) or their son. Now, he is about to re-live his first ever Christmas, as he can't remember the previous 49 . Petrina Wickens (left) says her husband can't remember their marriage or anyone in his family. 'He is not the same man he used to be,' she said. The pair are pictured on their wedding day . Since the incident in January, the father-of-three has been forced to rebuild relationships with friends and family, supported by a wife he doesn't remember. Mrs Wickens, 43, said: 'It was outside his own house, he was cut by a punch to the head and had five stitches.' 'He fell to the ground and smacked his head.' She is mother to three-year-old Jenson and has two children from a previous marriage, while Mr Wickens also has two daughters from a previous marriage. She continued: 'He can't remember anybody - not even his own daughters. It has been horrible. 'He knows who I am now, but he can't remember getting married and he doesn't recognise our son. 'He doesn't remember going to school, he doesn't remember his brother and he doesn't remember the birth of his own son. She added: 'He is not the same man he used to be. 'He doesn't eat the same food or watch the same television programmes. 'We have had to get to know each other all over again. 'This year will be like his first Christmas, which is exciting but very sad at the same time.' Mr Wickens, a vehicle plant worker, was fixing a car outside his home when he was met by a group of bystanders who watched him work. Mr Wickens (centre), a vehicle plant worker, was fixing a car outside his home when the attack happened. He is pictured with his wife Petrina (left) and their son Jenson (right), now three, at his christening in 2011 . Later that night two teenagers started acting aggressively towards some of the youngsters in the group. After trying to defend the children, a heated argument broke out for about 15 minutes which resulted in Mr Wickens being violently attacked. He was rushed to hospital where he stayed for six hours receiving stitches. When he woke up, his family were panicked when he didn't recognise them, but doctors reassured them, saying his memory would gradually return. But after months passed and he still could not remember, experts re-assessed and now say tit is unlikely his memory will ever return. A 17-year-old man is due to appear in court in April charged with carrying out the assault, which has left Mr Wickens with amnesia and anxiety about leaving the house. He now works from home and is visited by friends who reintroduce themselves in the hopes of rebuilding their friendship from scratch. Mr Wickens says he is grateful for his family's support. 'It is a horrible feeling not being able to remember the first 49 years of your life,' he said. 'I look at photos of me from the past but they do not bring back any recollections.' He is pictured getting ready for Christmas with his wife (left) and son (centre) Mrs Wickens, who claims her husband's attacker was drunk and high on drugs, said: 'He has got to know us all again over the year and is building up relationships with his friends, but a lot of people keep away. 'They are worried about him not recognising them. It's such a shame, and he's missed out on so much, like his grand-daughter's birth. 'He's completely lost the confidence he used to have.' Mr Wickens said being unable to remember the past is terrifying. He said: 'It is a horrible feeling not being able to remember the first 49 years of your life.

"A stone knife found at a prehistoric gateway into Europe could force anthropologists to rewrite theories about how our human ancestors first arrived on the continent. Archaeologists discovered the sharp stone tool at an ancient site on the Gediz river, to the east of Izmir, on the Anatolian peninsula of Turkey. They believe the quartzite tool was made around 1.2 million years ago, meaning early humans were in the area far earlier than previously believed. Archaeologists discovered the sharp stone tool at an ancient site on the Gediz river, to the east of Izmir, on the Anatolian peninsula of Turkey. The sharp quartzite stone tool (pictured) is thought to have been shaped using a technique called hard hammer flaking . Sitting at the gateway between Asia and Europe, this could also mean scientists need to reassess how early humans entered Europe. The earliest human remains to be discovered so far in Europe are 1.2 million-year-old bone fragments from the extinct Homo antecessor at Atapuerca, Spain. The spread of human ancestors has been a controversial subject and has led to competing theories of how humans evolved. Homo erectus migrated out of Africa around 1.8 million years ago. By around 500,000 years ago it had vanished from Africa and much of Asia and was, until now, thought to have survived in Indonesia until as recently as 35,000 years ago. Early modern humans reached the region about 40,000 years ago, and so were believed to have co-existed with their ancestors. But recent research suggests this assumption was wrong - and Homo erectus disappeared long before the arrival of Homo sapiens in Asia. Excavations in Indonesia, however, indicate that Homo erectus had gone extinct at least 143,000 years ago, and perhaps more than 550,000 years ago. Another extinct species of human, called Homo antecessor, is thought to have been living in Atapuerca, Spain, at least 1.2 million years ago. Footprints attributed to Homo antecessor have also been found in Happisburgh in Norfolk. However, the discovery of stone tools in western Turkey could mean that another species, Homo erectus, whose remains have been found at sites nearby, could have also moved into Europe at around the same time. Researchers from Royal Holloway University of London, now believe the discovery of the stone tool supports claims that Anatolia was occupied by these human ancestors 1.2 million years ago. Professor Danielle Schreve, from the department of geography, said: 'This discovery is critical for establishing the timing and route of early human dispersal into Europe. 'Our research suggests the flake is the earliest securely-dated artefact from Turkey ever recorded and was dropped on the floodplain by an early hominin well over a million years ago. 'The dating of the flake suggests that the maker would have been Homo erectus, which is widely believed to have evolved in Africa and then spread into Eurasia by 2 million years. 'There is also a partial skull of Homo erectus from the site of Kocabas in Turkey - this particular site has been re-dated several times, with dates from around half a million to just over a million years old, so the new evidence from the Gedix River really firms up our knowledge of chronology of early human occupation in Turkey. 'Home erectus were probably the first early humans to live in hunter-gatherer groups.' The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Quaternary Science Reviews, used high-precision radioisotopic dating and palaeomagnetic measurements from lava flows above and below the sediment where the stone was found, at a site known as Kale Tepe. This means the lava flows both pre-date and post-date the appearance of the ancient deposits from the river Gediz where the tool was found. This allowed the researchers to establish that early humans were present in the area between approximately 1.24 million and 1.17 million years ago. Previously, the oldest hominin fossils in western Turkey were the skull fragments recovered in 2007 at Koçabas, in Anatolia. The stone tool (inset) was found in the upper part of layer of U3 on the outcrop, just below M2. The earliest human remains found in Europe are 1.2 million-year-old bone fragments from the extinct Homo antecessor in Spain. The discovery of this tool could mean Homo erectus also moved into Europe at around the same time . The stone tool was dropped in ancient river sediment at Kale Tepe around 1.2 million years ago, close to where skull fragments thought to belong to human ancestor Homoe erectus were discovered at Koçabas . These fossilised remains are thought to be from Homo erectus and were initially dated as being 510,000 years old. More recent research has revised this to being between 1.1 million and 1.3 million years old. However the age of other stone artefacts found with the remains were difficult to date. The discovery of the stone tool at Kale Tepe now supports the revised age for the skull fragments. Speaking to  Mail Online, Professor Schreve said: 'When the flake was struck, it would have had razor-sharp edges and presumably been used, as we know other flakes were, for cutting hides, meat or even plant materials. 'There are a handful of sites in southern Europe - Spain, Italy and southern France - that have produced artefacts dating to around 1.2 million years. 'However, the dating of these sites is very controversial in many cases, or the stone tools are not clearly associated with the dated deposits, which makes it difficult to make meaningful observations as to the timing and route of dispersal of early humans. 'The key point regarding the new flake from Turkey is that it comes from river sediments that are sandwiched between volcanic deposits, which can be securely dated using two very robust methods, Argon-Argon dating and palaeomagnetism. 'Western Turkey is an important area as a gateway to Europe so this is secure confirmation, for the first time, of early humans in this area.' The scientists said the stone tool showed no sign erosion that would suggest it had been transported by the river, leading them to conclude it had been dropped in sediment beside the river by whoever made it . The world's oldest stone tools are thought to be 2,600 sharp-edged flakes found in a dry riverbed of the Afar region of Ethiopia that date to around 2.6 million years ago. As these tools predate the oldest known Homanin remains, it remains unknown who made them. However, fossilised bones bearing cut marks inflicted by stone tools have been discovered in Ethiopia, and were dated at 3.4 million years old. This suggests that Australopithecus afarensis - the same species as the human ancestor Lucy - were using stone tools and eating meat. Professor Schreve added: 'The flake was an incredibly exciting find. 'I had been studying the sediments in the meander bend and my eye was drawn to a pinkish stone on the surface. 'When I turned it over for a better look, the features of a humanly-struck artefact were immediately apparent. 'By working together with geologists and dating specialists, we have been able to put a secure chronology to this find and shed new light on the behaviour of our most distant ancestors.""","Quartzite tool was made 1.2 million years ago by striking a hard rock .

"Iconic: Thirty years ago this month, influential teen magazine Just Seventeen launched and after its untimely close in 2004, Stylist magazine have paid tribute . Thirty years ago this month influential teen magazine Just Seventeen landed on newsagents' shelves. With its hunky cover stars (Ronan Keating in a lilac satin shirt is just one example), sex tips and informative advice pages for girls who might have 'gone too far behind the bike sheds', J17, as it came to be known, was the best thing about Wednesdays. The publication folded in 2004 after losing a third of its readership, but Stylist.co.uk have paid tribute to the magazine that defined our teenage years (and beyond) with a brilliant open letter this week ... ""Dear Just Seventeen, we know you won't read this now that you're gone, but we owe you a thank you. We only spent a few years together, but I'll never forget them. When we met, we weren't 'just seventeen' at all. We were barely 13, stuck in small towns and dreaming of more. All we remember of our first encounter was that we were quickly smitten. With your advice (yes to backcombed hair, no to sensible shoes), celebrity gossip and knowledge of all things boy-shaped, you were like the most popular girl at school… except you actually wanted to hang out with us. Every Wednesday we would hot-foot it to the newsagent and hand over 70p and revel in your company. The shop shelves were filled with other teen mags, but they were never as cool as you. OK, . so you had a fondness for Terry from East 17. But you also introduced . us to Keanu Reeves, The Smashing Pumpkins, Damon Albarn and River . Phoenix. Although, as we learned from real life stories such as, 'Suspended For Loving Keanu', it's important to keep your celebrity . crushes in perspective. While other mags swooned over 90210 heartthrob Jason Priestley, you leaned towards bad boy Luke Perry who was much hotter. Best friend: 'With your advice (yes to backcombed hair, no to sensible shoes), celebrity gossip and knowledge of all things boy-shaped, you were like the most popular girl at school' You championed outsiders and made us feel slightly less of one.

"Harvard University's ban on Israeli-made SodaStream machines on campus enacted at the request of pro-Palestinian student groups has now all but fizzled out. University President Drew Faust and Provost Alan Garber reversed the Ivy League school's decision to cut ties with SodaStream last week after learning that Harvard University Dining Services (HUDS) had banned SodaStream products from campus because the company has a plant in the hotly contested West Bank territory. 'Harvard University’s procurement decisions should not and will not be driven by individuals’ views of highly contested matters of political controversy,' Garber said in a statement to Boston Magazine. Bubbling tensions: Harvard University has reversed a decision to ban SodaStream machines manufactured in the West Bank from campus dining halls . Apple of discord: Harvard University Dining Services had booted SodaStream products off campus because the company has a plant in the hotly contested West Bank territory . The ban on SodaStream machines was introduced last spring after Harvard administrators held a meeting with the pro-Palestinian student group Palestine Solidarity Committee and the Harvard Islamic Society. The decision caused a stir on campus, leading outspoken Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz to write an option piece for The Jerusalem Post arguing that members of the pro-Palestinian faction of the Harvard community could have simply boycotted the SodaStream machines on campus rather than imposing their views on everyone else. ‘I’m sure that some students are offended by any products made in Israel, just as some are offended by products made in Arab or Muslim countries that oppress gays, Christians, and women,’ he wrote. ‘The end result should be freedom of choice: those who disapprove of SodaStream should be free to drink Pepsi. But those who don’t disapprove should be free to drink SodaStream.’ HUDS administrators have since issued an apology for basing their decision solely on the opinion of the pro-Palestinian bloc of the student body. ‘In this instance, we mistakenly factored political concerns raised by students on a particularly sensitive issue into a decision on soda machines,’ a spokesperson for HUDS told the Boston Magazine. University President Drew (left) Faust and Provost Alan Garber (right) said in a statement they didn't know the decision to cut ties with SodaStream was in response to a request made by a pro-Palestinian group . Fizzy vengeance: Pro-Israeli activists have sent the Harvard president and the provost two new SodaStream machines (not pictured) to send them a message . Pro-Israeli activists on Tuesday struck back at top Harvard officials, shipping the president and the provost two new SodaStream machines as payback for the ban, reported Washington Free Beacon. The gifts were accompanied by a note that read: ‘Please enjoy this SodaStream machine, made by Jewish and Arab employees working side-by-side in an Israeli-owned factory,. We hope you will enjoy SodaStream products as much as we do—like millions of people around the world who support coexistence and peace.’ Pro-Israel students on campus expressed disappointment that their views were left out of the debate, and that the college based its decision vis-à-vis SodaStream entirely on the opinions of their ideological rivals. This was not the first time that HUDS’ purchasing decision has been informed by political concerns. Last year, dining services officials stopped serving Barilla pasta in response to anti-gay views expressed by the company’s chairman, according to The Harvard Crimson. In October, SodaStream announced that it will be closing the factory in the West Bank ‘for commercial reasons’ and moving its operation to a location within Israel. A pro-Palestinian boycott movement has targeted businesses that operate in the West Bank, saying they benefit from Israel's occupation of the territory, which was captured in 1967 and is claimed by the Palestinians.

"British Airways and easyJet planes were forced to abort landings at Leeds Bradford Airport at the last minute due to high winds. Amazing footage has emerged showing the aircraft battling against strong winds in an attempt to land, before pulling up at the last moment. The BA flight, which had flown from Heathrow to Leeds, attempted to land at about 2.30pm on Thursday, but was forced to divert to Manchester Airport due to the difficult weather conditions. Wind speeds around what is the highest airport in England had reached up to 60mph earlier in the day. Two videos  show the planes swaying from side to side as the pilots attempts to land. The wings on both aircrafts are seen dipping dramatically. As they near the ground, the decision is clearly made to abort the landings and the planes pull back up into the sky. The BA plane from Heathrow to Leeds can be seen battling against high winds . The Briths Airways aircraft eventually diverted to Manchester Airport and passengers were shuttled back to Leeds by coach. Tony Hallwood, spokesperson fro Leeds Bradford Airport, told MailOnline: 'Unfortunately due to high winds, with gusts reaching up to 60 miles per hour, there were a number of delays and a small number of cancellations in during the day. 'The whole of Yorkshire was one of the most seriously affected locations in the UK, which impacted the airport fro about nine hours.' Wind husts in Yorkshire reached up to 60mph yesterday, affecting flights into Leeds Airport . After attempting to land, the plane eventually pulls back up and diverts to Manchester Airport . High winds have continued to affect flights in the UK, with British Airways tweeting this morning: 'It's windy at London Heathrow, Gatwick & City today. Check your flight status here.' The flight diversion at Leeds came as Stansted Airport in Essex battled its own problems. A power outage caused minor delays to flights, although the airport confirmed neither the main terminal nor the runway were affected and that passengers were being taken by bus to their flights. About four million Britons are heading overseas during this festive period, estimated the travel association Abta, a slight increase on last year. Heathrow is the busiest British departure point with almost 700,000 passengers leaving between December 19 and Christmas Day. Gatwick is expecting more than 1.7 million passengers to travel through the airport between December 19 and January 5. MailOnline has contacted British Airways for comment.","Flight from Heathrow to Leeds Bradford attempted landing in high winds .

"A South Texas research facility where 13 primates died of hyperthermia in overheated rooms could face federal penalties, a U.S. Department of Agriculture spokeswoman said Monday. A federal inspector found that two animals died in September when a thermostat malfunctioned at Covance Research Products in Alice, causing the room temperature to soar. A similar incident occurred about a month later when a thermostat override switch failed, causing the deaths of 11 primates. Deaths: A thermostat malfunction at Covance Research Products in Texas caused the deaths of multiple monkeys in two separate incidents (stock image) Covance: Photographed is the Covance Research Products facility in Texas where 13 monkeys died as a result of soaring temperatures in the facility . Covance, which is headquartered in Princeton, New Jersey, provides animal testing to aid in the development of drugs for an array of ailments, from heart disease to diabetes, said Covance spokeswoman Melissa Thompson. The company notified USDA after the second incident, and corrective steps were taken that included plans to install temperature alarms in all animal housing rooms, according to a Nov. 21 federal inspector's report. USDA is now considering what actions it should take, spokeswoman Tanya Espinosa said Monday. Espinosa did not know how hot the rooms became, but the inspector's report notes rooms housing primates cannot rise about 85 degrees for more than four consecutive hours. Cynomolgus: Photographed is a cynomolgus monkey, a type of macaque that is often used in medical research . Animal Rights: Michael Budkie, executive director of Ohio-based Stop Animal Exploitation Now, said he's filed a complaint with USDA seeking a fine of more than $100,000 against Covance . Thompson said the primates that died were cynomolgus monkeys, a type of macaque that is often used in medical research. Covance said in a statement that the facility will be manually monitored until it adds electronic temperature monitoring and alerts. 'Covance takes very seriously our ethical and regulatory responsibilities to treat research animals with the utmost care and respect,' the company said. Facility: Enforcement action could include a letter of warning, a fine, or forwarding the matter to a court that could suspend or revoke the facility's operating license . Michael Budkie, executive director of Ohio-based Stop Animal Exploitation Now, said he's filed a complaint with USDA seeking a fine of more than $100,000 against Covance. 'The negligence which allowed primates to literally be cooked to death on two separate incidents deserves the maximum penalty,' Budkie said. 'These monkeys suffered horribly, dying unnecessarily, and this facility should pay the price.' Espinosa said USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service must review Covance's compliance history before determining whether to penalize the company. Enforcement action could include a letter of warning, a fine, or forwarding the matter to a court that could suspend or revoke the facility's operating license.","A thermostat malfunction at Covance Research Products in Texas caused the deaths of multiple monkeys in two separate incidents .

"The Navy SEAL Team Six member who unveiled himself as the man who shot dead Osama bin Laden is reportedly being investigated by military police for leaking secrets. Robert O'Neill, who came forward as the mystery shooter who killed the al-Qaeda leader during a 2011 raid, allegedly gave away crucial details of the mission and prompted a probe by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS). He is suspected of leaking classified information, which could lead to criminal charges from the elite federal bureau, according to The Daily Beast. Scroll down for video . 'Under investigation': According to reports, bin Laden shooter Robert O'Neill is being investigated . Limelight: O'Neill stepped forward to star in a TV news tell-all about his role in the mission - despite being warned against it by Navy SEAL top brass . On its website the NCIS says that it usually only investigates allegations that could lead to a year or more in prison. O'Neill was repeatedly warned by Naval top brass not to go on air and speak about his participation in the secretive mission - but appeared anyway and spoke at length about his role. He gave a long, two-part interview to Fox News in November in which he gave his life story up to the mission, then described it in moment-to-moment detail. He had previously been the subject of an anonymous account in Esquire magazine about the mission. Some have argued that nothing he said - beyond identifying himself - goes beyond leaks about the operation already made by other authorities, including White House politicians. He told how he shot bin Laden three times in the head after leaping from a helicopter and busting into the terrorist compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. His account, in which he fires three bullets into bin Laden's head and splits his skull, has been disputed by other SEAL sources, who say it is impossible to know who fired the fatal shot. Three shots: O'Neill said that he is certain that he and he alone felled the al-Qaeda leader - splitting his skull open with three bullets . Another member of the elite Team Six, Matt Bissonnette, has also claimed to be the man who killed him, and wrote a book about his exploits. Before the revelations, SEAL high command distributed a letter urging current and former officers to stick to their non-disclosure agreements. Rear Admiral Brian Losey, the commander of the Naval Special Warfare Group, wrote: 'At Naval Special Warfare's core is the SEAL ethos. 'A critical tenant of our ethos is ""I do not advertise the nature of my work, nor seek recognition for my actions."" 'Violators of our Ethos are neither Temmates in good standing, not Teammates who represent Naval Special Warfare. 'We do not abide willful or selfish disregard for our core values in return for public notoriety and financial gain, which only diminishes otherwise honorable service, courage and sacrifice. 'Our credibility as a premier fighting force is forged in this sacrifice and has been accomplished with honor, as well as humility.' A spokesman told DailyMail.com: 'The NCIS is in receipt of an allegation that Mr O'Neill may have revealed classified information to persons not authorized to receive such information.

"These are the two men who appeared in court this morning accused of murdering an off-duty police officer during a Christmas night out. Christopher Spendlove, 30, and Andrew Taylor, 28, are accused of beating newlywed officer Neil Doyle to death in an 'unprovoked and vicious attack' in Liverpool city centre. The men, who are both former non-league footballers who also played in the U.S., were remanded in custody at today's hearing at Liverpool Crown Court. Scroll down for video . Christopher Spendlove, 30 (left), and Andrew Taylor, 28 (right), are accused of murdering newlywed police officer Neil Doyle in Liverpool city centre in the early hours of Friday. They appeared in court this morning . PC Neil Doyle (pictured), who got married just five months ago, was with two other off-duty officers when they were attacked in Liverpool city centre in the early hours of Friday. PC Doyle died of a fatal bleed on the brain . Up to 40 people crammed into the public gallery for the brief hearing, which lasted no more than 10 minutes. Among those on one side of the gallery was believed to be Spendlove's mother, who gestured warmly to her son as he was led from the dock. The defendants, both from Liverpool, spoke only to confirm their names and dates of birth. Spendlove confirmed his date of birth as last Thursday. PC Doyle, who got married just five months ago, and two other off-duty officers were attacked in the city's Colquitt Street in the early hours of Friday. A post-mortem examination concluded that PC Doyle died from a fatal bleed around the brain. The other two officers, named in court today as Michael Steventon and Robert Marsh, were treated in hospital for facial injuries. Both defendants, who are well known on the non-league football circuit, also face charges of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. The incident occurred in Liverpool's Colquitt Street at 3.15am on Friday . Both defendants also face charges of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to those two officers. No applications for bail were made as the Recorder of Liverpool, Judge Clement Goldstone QC, adjourned the proceedings and said a trial date would be set at the next preliminary hearing in January. Richard Pratt QC, representing Taylor, said there were some matters of 'considerable anxiety' for his client which he wished to be aired in court, and were noted by the judge. Following the hearing, Mr Pratt confirmed to the Press Association that Taylor wanted to 'deflect' any suggestion that last Friday's incident was a targeted attack and that Taylor did not deliver any blows. Spendlove and Taylor (pictured playing for Forest Green Rovers) are known on the non-league football circuit . It is understood that both defendants, said to be close friends, played football together while studying at Oklahoma City University in America. They were team-mates at U.S. soccer league outfit Austin Aztex, who were managed at the time by former Everton star Adrian Heath. Taylor returned to the UK to sign for non-league team Forest Green Rovers in 2009 before later moving to Burscough FC and Vauxhall Motors. Spendlove stayed in the U.S. and went on to play for Portland Phoenix, Wilmington Hammerheads and Oklahoma City Energy FC, where he was announced as a new assistant coach in January. The Oklahoma City Energy FC’s General Manager, Jason Hawkins said the organisation was 'stunned' by the news. 'Given the seriousness of the charges, we have made the decision to dismiss Chris from the organization.

"Southampton have confirmed the signing of Werder Bremen winger Eljero Elia on loan until the end of the campaign. The Dutch international will officially join Saints on January 3 with a view to a permanent transfer next summer, the club revealed in a statement on their website. The Saints have been left short of attacking options with Jay Rodriguez's recovery from a cruciate ligament injury taking longer than expected and Sadio Mane due to leave for the African Nations Cup next month. Southampton have confirmed the loan signing of Werder Bremen winger Eljero Elia . Elia (left) will join the club on January 3 with a view to a permanent transfer next summer . Elia took to Instagram to thank the Werder Bremen fans for their support during his time at the club . The former Hamburg midfielder has made 28 appearances for Holland . Elia, who has played 28 times for Holland, is seen as the perfect man to bolster Koeman's front three as the club look to maintain their excellent start to the Barclays Premier League season. 'He is one of the players on our list to bring in in January - it's still not done but yes, I am interested in the player,' Koeman said ahead of completing the move. 'If he signs for Southampton, I think he will be a good option. 'We need at least one more player up front because we lose Sadio Mane in January for the Africa Cup. We need another player for that position and he is a good option. 'If he does sign for us, it will first be as a loan deal.' The Dutchman made 33 league appearances for Werder Bremen last season . Southampton are set to lose midfielder Sadio Mane to the African Nations Cup next month . Elia, who is known for his blistering pace and direct forward runs, established himself as one of the brightest young talents in Europe at FC Twente and was named Dutch Football Talent of the Year in 2009. The 27-year-old struggled to fulfil his early promise during subsequent moves to Hamburg and Juventus but has enjoyed more stability at Bremen, where he made 33 league appearances last season. 'He was a Dutch international, he had not such a good period in Germany but I believe in the qualities of the player,' Koeman said. Morgan Schneiderlin attracted interest from Arsenal and Tottenham during the summer . 'He is a wing player and we normally play with both a right winger and a left winger. 'We also like in our style of playing fast people who can play one against one with quality.' Southampton may again have to fend off interest in midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin in January. Tottenham and Arsenal both pursued the Frenchman in the summer but the club stood firm and Koeman insists even a large bid will not prise the 25-year-old away in the transfer window. He said: 'Will we sell Schneiderlin if we receive a very big bid? No, we do not sell Schneiderlin in January.'

"With 17 games gone, Chelsea and Manchester City have broken away from the chasing pack. Sportsmail’s expert columnist assesses both teams’ chances in the title race. GOALKEEPER . Chelsea - 9.5, Manchester City - 9 . I’m a really big Joe Hart fan, but it has been an inspired decision by Jose Mourinho to bring Thibaut Courtois back from his loan at Atletico Madrid and make him Chelsea’s No 1. Hart had a tough spell last year, every goalkeeper has to suffer that, and he’s come back stronger, commands the area and has made key saves. But if Courtois stays at Chelsea he could become the Premier League’s best ever goalkeeper. He is exceptional — if you could choose one goalkeeper in the league to have in your team it would be him. Manchester City face a tough battle with Chelsea to retain their Premier League crown . Thibaut Courtois has been excellent in goal since coming back from Atletico Madrid and replacing Petr Cech . Joe Hart has been a leader for Manchester City at the back after overcoming a tough spell last season . DEFENCE . Chelsea - 9, Manchester City - 9 . When both teams have their back four fit, I can’t separate them. You can name Chelsea’s four in defence pretty much every week, which has helped Mourinho. Branislav Ivanovic, John Terry, Gary Cahill and Cesar Azpilicueta are a tight unit, extremely strong, and they have Filipe Luis to bring in at left back if they need a more attacking approach. Manchester City hardly ever name the same back four, switching Pablo Zabaleta, Vincent Kompany, Martin Demichelis, Eliaquim Mangala, Aleksandar Kolarov and Gael Clichy. But they are all top-quality defenders who combine well in a back four. John Terry (centre) scored at Stoke on Monday night and he leads a strong Chelsea back line . Manchester City have been without their leader and captain Vincent Kompany due to injury problems . MIDFIELD . Chelsea - 9.5, Manchester City - 9 . Chelsea just edge this after bringing in Nemanja Matic and Cesc Fabregas this year. If you look at match-winners, both Chelsea and City are full of them. David Silva is a little genius, Samir Nasri is finding form and Yaya Toure can turn defence into attack, run the length of the field and score. Willian, Eden Hazard, Oscar and Fabregas are brilliant technicians. Frank Lampard has switched sides and will have a vital role for City, but what Chelsea lost in his goals they’ve made up for with Fabregas’s assists; it’s unbelievable he has 12 already. It is defensive midfield where Chelsea are slightly stronger. Manuel Pellegrini has two similar players in Fernando and Fernandinho who can play that role, but neither are close to Matic, who has been phenomenal. Despite not always being at his best, Yaya Toure provides Man City with strength and power in midfield . Cesc Fabregas has been a creative genius for Chelsea since his move from Barcelona in the summer . Nemanja Matic has forged a reputation as one of the best defensive midfielders in the Premier League . Frank Lampard moved from Chelsea to Manchester City and scored against his former club in September . ATTACK . Chelsea - 9, Manchester City - 9.5 . Manchester City are ahead in this department, based purely on Sergio Aguero. Chelsea’s Diego Costa is a brilliant striker and just what Mourinho needed, but Aguero was unstoppable before his injury. They need him fit and firing if they want to win the league. Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic for City, and Didier Drogba, who is not the player he once was, and Loic Remy at Chelsea are strong alternative options. But it will be a case of who can stay fittest the longest out of Aguero and Costa. Sergio Aguero's goals this season have kept City in touch with Chelsea, but he is currently injured .

White Hart Lane - January 1 . Emirates Stadium - April 25 . MY TITLE VERDICT... Chelsea - 37/40, Manchester City - 36.5/40 . There is barely anything to pick between the two teams, but what will be a decisive factor is that Chelsea have already got results in difficult away fixtures, whereas City still have many to play. It gives Chelsea that little advantage which could make the difference. There is no love lost between Mourinho and Pellegrini — these two will never be friends. Pellegrini has no respect for Mourinho and it’s the same the other way. The league is a two-horse race and right now the Chelsea manager is inching ahead of his rival.

"Tiger Woods cannot wait for 2015 to begin after admitting to feeling 'incredible relief' to finally be over his injury problems. The 14-time major winner failed to make the cut at the US PGA Championship in August, having struggled to get back into shape following surgery on a pinched nerve in his back earlier in the year. He returned at the Hero World Challenge, the tournament he annually hosts which benefits his foundation, on his home course of Isleworth in Florida earlier this month, but he was physically ill during his third round and was unable to avoid finishing joint-last.

"A couple's dream honeymoon became a nightmare after they were struck down with stomach bugs. Just days after touching down in the Dominican Republic, Rebecca and Matthew Lott say they were infected with crippling gastric illnesses, turning their five-star getaway into a 'horrendous' ordeal. Matthew, 28, said the start of their wedded life together was ruined by the experience at the Caribe Princess Resort in June this year after they booked with Thomson Holidays, part of the TUI UK group. The couple's honeymoon to the five-star Caribe Princess Resort turned into a nightmare . They suffered from symptoms including diarrhoea, sickness, blood in their stools and fever from early in the first week of their two-week stay, and continued to feel the effects after they got back home to Prestwich. Account manager Matthew said: 'We'd had a perfect wedding day, it was everything we'd hoped for, but now our lasting memory of such a special time in our lives is clouded by the honeymoon, which was just a disaster. 'We were concerned about the conditions at the hotel and both of us suffered from horrendous symptoms throughout our honeymoon and even now we are still suffering from on-going illness which has had a huge impact on our lives.' Following their wedding, Matthew and Rebecca Lott headed for their honeymoon to the Dominican Republic, where they contracted severe stomach illnesses . The honeymoon suite is advertised on the hotel's website as costing $2,324 (£1,500) for a two-week trip in June, excluding flights. The newlyweds have now asked solicitors to investigate as they believe the resort was responsible for ruining their first trip as a married couple. The couple claim undercooked food was served throughout their stay, including raw pieces of chicken, and said flies swarmed over food being served, and birds flying around inside the restaurant were a regular sight. Nichola Blackburn, from Irwin Mitchell solicitors, said: 'We are now investigating how our clients became ill during their honeymoon. 'This was meant to be a holiday of a lifetime for Rebecca and Matthew who were celebrating the start of their married life. The illness they suffered ruined their holiday'. A Thomson spokeswoman said: 'We are sorry to hear of the Lotts' experience at the Caribe Princess Resort in the Dominican Republic this summer. 'Thomson closely audits all resorts to which we operate to ensure that health, hygiene and comfort levels are maintained in line with industry standards. 'As this case is now subject to legal proceedings it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.'","Rebecca and Matthew Lott stayed at the Caribe Princess Resort .

"A documentary film which confirms that Michael Rockefeller, the youngest son of former Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, was eaten by cannibals in New Guinea in 1961 is set to be released by Netflix in the new year. The Search For Michael Rockefeller, will be released on the streaming service on February 1 and confirms that one of the most compelling unsolved mysteries of the 20th century ended with the 23-year-old heir being devoured, reports the New York Post. Rockefeller, whose great-grandfather was the co-founder of Standard Oil and established one of America's wealthiest dynasties, traveled to New Guinea to photograph the Asmat people and collect their art. Scroll down for video . Netflix has announced that it will screen the documentary based on Milt Machlin's book The Search For Michael Rockefeller in February. It claims Rockefeller, left, was devoured by cannibals . He disappeared after a trading canoe that he was traveling in down the cannibal coast of New Guinea capsized. Several miles off shore, heavy seas swamped his craft. After a night adrift, Rockefeller set out to swim for the distant shore, leaving his companion René Wessing with the fateful words: 'I think I can make it…' He was never seen again. Rockefeller's death was eventually ruled a drowning, but there have long been questions about the official version of events. The Search For Michael Rockefeller hit the festival circuit in 2011, but it has yet to enjoy a wide release. According to its website, the movie is based on original footage and materials obtained when author and adventurer Milt Machlin mounted an expedition in search of Rockefeller in 1969. Machlin, the editor of Argosy magazine who coined the phrases 'Bermuda Triangle' and 'the Abominable Snowman', was inspired by an eyewitness report that Rockefeller was alive and being held against his will. Rockefeller disappeared after a trading canoe that he was traveling down the cannibal coast of New Guinea in capsized in 1961 . The Asmats, a notoriously violent New Guinea tribe, tortured, beheaded and ate Rockefeller in a ritualistic cannibal killing . The movie was directed and produced by Fraser Heston, the son of famed actor Charlton Heston. It includes previously unreleased footage and eyewitness interviews, including some startling revelations, 'which shed new light on the unsolved mystery of Michael's disappearance.' Last year, Carl Hoffman published Savage Harvest, a book that also theorized that Rockefeller was eaten by cannibals. He carried out extensive research in the Netherlands as well as New Guinea where he meet with the Asmat tribesmen for the full story and cover-up to emerge. According to Hoffman, Rockefeller was almost at the shore when he came across a group of 50 natives waiting in eight 40' long canoes nestled in the trees. The men recognized Rockefeller from having been in the village, but one of the drove his spear into the man's ribs before they pulled him into a canoe. Last year, Carl Hoffman published Savage Harvest, a book in which he also theorized that Rockefeller was eaten by cannibals . Once on shore, the men of the Asmats - a notoriously violent New Guinea tribe - tortured, beheaded and ate Rockefeller in a ritualistic cannibal killing. The reason for the horrific killing was revenge. Before Rockefeller had arrived, the Dutch had taken over the archipelago and the man overseeing the colony, Max Lapre, had ordered five elite Asmats to be gunned down. The author believes the Rockefellers knew the truth after the AP ran a wire story where a priest recounted Michael being cannibalized and eaten by the Asmats. The Dutch government denied it was true and the newspaper rescinded the story. No Rockefeller has returned to Asmat nor publicly accepted any other version than Michael drowned.","Netflix has announced that it will screen The Search For Michael Rockefeller in February .

"Co-stars: Sir Roger with Eleanor Parker in Interrupted Melody in 1955 . As James Bond he could have any woman he desired but it appears that even Sir Roger Moore has one that got away. The 87-year-old has revealed he fell 'secretly in love' with actress Eleanor Parker after they appeared together in a film in 1955. But, speaking publicly about his feelings for the first time, Sir Roger said he never made a move on the Sound of Music star because they were both married at the time. In fact, Miss Parker died last year at the age of 91, without ever knowing the impact she had on the actor. In an interview on BBC Radio 3's Private Passions, Sir Roger said working opposite Miss Parker on film Interrupted Melody left a lasting impression on him. He also said the project, about Australian opera singer Marjorie Lawrence, kindled his love for the musical style, particularly Verdi and Puccini. He said: 'I was very fortunate enough to make a film with Eleanor Parker in which she played Marjorie Lawrence, an Australian operatic star who developed poliomyelitis, and I played her brother Cyril and we had wonderful excerpts from all the operas and liking and having a great affection for music, music of any sort except for 'yeah, yeah, yeah', I had a wonderful time on the whole. 'I'm often asked 'Who has you worked with who you really thought was great?' and I think Eleanor Parker was the first and one of the only who was a really accomplished actress, a really caring actress, who was most unselfish and I was secretly in love with her. Of course, she was married to a wonderful painter and I was married elsewhere.' Miss Parker, best known for her role as the Baroness in The Sound of Music, was five year's Sir Roger's senior at 33 and married to Hollywood portrait painter Paul Clemens, the third of her four husbands. She was already a big star, having had critically acclaimed roles in Detective Story and Caged. Scroll down for video . Sir Roger, by contrast was still relatively unknown, three years before he would make his name in television series Ivanhoe and nearly two decades before he would take on the mantle of 007. At the time, he was married to Welsh singer Dorothy Squires, the second of his four wives. Miss Parker, who was nominated for three Oscars, including one for Interrupted Melody, died in December last year from complications with pneumonia. She never worked with Sir Roger again and it is not known if the pair kept in contact outside of work. In the wide ranging interview, broadcast on Sunday, the actor speaks openly about his home life and paints a picture of himself as a romantic husband, dancing with his wife, Swedish socialite Kristina Tholstrup, 72, every night before bed. The James Bond star 87, pictured with his fourth wife Kristina Tholstrup, never told Miss Parker how he felt . The radio programme is based around celebrities choosing their favourite pieces of classical music and, picking the slow movement of Mozart's piano concerto number 20 in D minor, Sir Roger, a father of three, explained: 'It's one of our bedtime tunes, I have it on my iPhone and about ten minutes before we're due to sleep, we close the books and I put the music on. 'My wife studied ballet and she does a little dance and I get up and I try to dance, I try to move my old arthritic knees. We have a little music and then the light goes off, it's one of our bedtime tunes.' While a love of classical music has been a thread running through much of the actor's life, one of his biggest regrets is giving up on his desire to play the violin, which he began lessons at a young age. After picking the opening of Tchaikovsky's violin concerto in D as one of his pieces because of his 'real passion for strings', he said: 'I am privileged to be at the right end of violins, not the end holding it but to listen to it. When I was eight, an uncle, great uncle, gave a violin to me and my father took me off to have lessons. After about six weeks the violin teacher told my father he was wasting his money, wasting his time and wasting my time and it's one of my big regrets.'","Actor, 87, developed feelings for Miss Parker during Interrupted Melody .

"Middle-aged drinkers are lowering their alcohol consumption as a result of health fears, according to a new survey. Researchers found a ‘marked decline’ in drinking with age, suggesting health warnings might finally be getting through. They found that twice as many people had given up alcohol as a decade ago. Older people with poor or deteriorating health had the steepest decline in the quantity and frequency of alcohol consumed. There has been a ‘marked decline’ in drinking with age, suggesting health warnings are finally working . It is thought opportunities for social drinking may be limited by poor health, while some people heeded medical advice about alcohol consumption and interactions with medication. The decade-long research project into the drinking habits of 4,500 people over the age of 45 also found older women reduced their drinking after the loss of a partner, contrary to previous findings. Widows reduced their drinking levels by more than 16 per cent, while those in a partnership cut back around 11 per cent over the 10-year study period. Poor health and lower levels of education resulted in lower levels of alcohol consumption – well below the threshold set for ‘safe’ drinking’. Academics at Keele University and University College London, who studied 4,500 men and women in England, say life events tend to lead to a drop in alcohol consumption in older adults. The exception was among wealthy, educated, single men who were most likely to drink more in later life and fail to cut down. This is likely due to multiple opportunities to socialise, as part of a single life, and having more disposable income. The study found most over-45s cut their alcohol consumption after a ‘life event’ such as bereavement. But rich, single men were the only exception, possibly because they have the most disposable income and opportunities to socialise. The average man aged over 45 drank 14 glasses, while retired men with poor health and no qualifications consumed five. The study, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, found older women drank seven glasses on average. Contrary to previous findings, they tended to reduce their drinking after a divorce or the death of their partner. Lead researcher Clare Holdsworth said: ‘Our findings suggest that the group most at risk of heavy drinking in later life are older single men with high levels of education and above average wealth. 'These men might not identify their drinking as problem behaviour.’ Those that used to or still smoke are most likely to drink more in later life. Such men drank on average an equivalent of 24 small glasses of wine a week at the start of the study in 1998 and 2000. This was in sharp contrast to single, retired men with poor health and no qualifications who drank on average an equivalent of five small glasses of wine a week at the start of the study. Rich, older men carried on drinking at these levels, while on average men over 45 drank around 14 small glasses of wine a week. Older women drank seven small glasses of red wine on average, says the study funded by the Economic and Social Research Council. The lower limits for safe drinking are set at 21 units for men and 14 for women. Just three per cent of older men and women were heavy drinkers – consuming more than 50 units a week for men and 35 units a week for women. For women, the end of a partnership was linked with less drinking. From the people studied, women who lost a partner reduced their drinking levels by more than 16 per cent at the end of the ten year study. This was a bigger reduction than those in a partnership whose drinking fell by 11 per cent during the same period. Middle aged people who had stopped drinking completely at the start of the study were more likely to experience an improvement in health compared to drinkers. Professor Clare Holdsworth, professor of Social Geography at Keele University and lead researcher on the project, said ‘Over the Christmas period many people consume more alcohol. A study found most over-45s cut back on alcohol after a ‘life event’ such as bereavement (file picture) ‘Our findings suggest that the group most at risk of heavy drinking in later life are older single men with high levels of education and above average wealth. ‘Suggesting that health organisations target this group is not necessarily straightforward as these men might not identify their drinking as problem behaviour. ‘Also this group are less likely to have poor health in the short term, hence the need for intervention might not be apparent.’ She said the research challenged conclusions from smaller studies that a partnership ending led to alcohol misuse in later life. ‘In particular, our analysis of drinking behaviours demonstrates that change in partnership status for women is associated with a reduction in alcohol consumption. ‘As a result it is not necessarily appropriate to target alcohol services at this group of older people’ she added.","Most over-45s cut consumption after 'life event' such as bereavement .

"Records are there to be broken, and that again has proven to be the case during a stellar sporting 2014. This year has provided major sporting events such as the World Cup, the Winter Olympics, the Commonwealth Games and the Ryder Cup - all of which have produced historic moments. Below, Sportsmail's reviews the sporting calendar in numbers from the biggest achievements to the unwanted demises. WORLD CUP . 171 - The number of goals scored at the World Cup in Brazil. That’s the joint-highest number ever scored at the tournament, level with the 1998 edition in France. 1 - England’s single point in Brazil was their lowest ever total in a World Cup group stage. It was the first time they had been knocked out at the group stage since 1958. Mario Gotze's (front) World Cup winning goal was the 171st at this summer's record-equalling tournament . 15 - The number of saves made by Tim Howard in the USA’s defeat to Belgium in the Last 16 of the World Cup. That’s more saves than in any other World Cup game since records began in 1966. Howard’s heroics made him an internet sensation and even earned him a call from the President, Barack Obama. 16 - Miroslav Klose became the all-time leading scorer in World Cups with a goal against Brazil in the semi-finals. The German striker has now scored 16 goals in four tournaments. 7-1 - Germany’s incredible 7-1 win over Brazil was the biggest-ever victory in a World Cup semi-final. It also helped Germany take their World Cup tally to 224 goals (they scored one more in the final), making them the highest-scoring nation in the competition’s history, three ahead of Brazil.

"Jose Mourinho is rabbiting through reasons why he adores his job when he mentions defeat. ‘I like the reaction after defeat,’ says the Chelsea manager, although he might not feel the same if he were in charge of Leicester or Hull. Mourinho has endured defeat only once in eight months, and since losing at Newcastle his team have produced four straight wins, 10 goals and top the Barclays Premier League by three points. Jose Mourinho says his side are showing champion qualities after storming start to the season . Signing Lionel Messi for Chelsea . How Mario Balotelli snubbed him . Why he would snub Portugal job . What makes Sir Alex Ferguson special . Moreover, there is a confident glint in his eye as his new-build team passes its character examinations like Monday’s win at Stoke. He sounds relaxed. ‘I feel we can do it,’ said Mourinho, in an interview with Clare Balding to be screened on BT Sport on Christmas Day. ‘We are ready to do it. We have prepared ourselves. We really believe that we are going to do it. ‘At the same time, feet on the ground. You have to understand the country where we play. The level of competition makes things more difficult than everywhere else. Mourinho speaks to Clare Balding in an interview to be screened on BT Sport on Christmas Day . John Terry helped Chelsea to victory against Stoke City on Monday night . Terry celebrates a fourth win in a row to give them a three-point cushion over their rivals . ‘At the same time it’s more beautiful because every point is a point, every game is a game and every weekend is a weekend and emotions from the beginning till the end. We are title contenders. We are one of the best teams. We are the team that plays better football and obviously big opponents, but we are title contenders.’ It is a distinct change of tone from last season when he convinced few people in claiming Chelsea were the ‘little horse’ in a title race with Manchester City and Liverpool. ‘Maybe next year we can win it,’ he said at the time. Maybe they will. They are in front and his players believe they can do it. Mourinho is not as cocksure as he was on the way to winning his first Premier League title in 2004-05, when he correctly predicted his team would clinch it at Bolton. Mourinho celebrates Chelsea's championship success with Frank Lampard and John Terry back in 2005 . Mourinho takes a swig of a bottle of champagne after Chelsea won the league in 2006 . But he knows how to run from the front, even if he aware that City know how to come from behind. It is nine years since Mourinho was top at Christmas in England. Then, Chelsea had 46 points from 17 games and were nine clear of Manchester United. This time, his team has 42, three clear of City. His last title triumph was in Spain in 2012, when Real Madrid led from the turn and finished with 100 points and a record 121 goals. ‘I know clearly the differences between La Liga and the Premier League,’ said Mourinho. ‘In Spain, everybody knows two teams are top of the world and a third, Atletico, is doing well. After that there’s a huge competitive difference. That’s why the record is 100 points. That’s not the best competition. It can be the best team but not the best competition.’ Mourinho has detected a desire from his players, boosted by the addition of Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas and Nemanja Matic to the camp. Cesc Fabregas has made a huge impact since his summer switch to Stamford Bridge . Chelsea came off the pitch at Stoke on Monday as they did after a hard-fought win at Blackburn on the way to their first title in 2004-05, which Mourinho admits is his most cherished trophy of those won at Stamford Bridge. It is why he spoke about a win worth ‘more than three points’ on Monday. Mourinho values these mental qualities highly. Sometimes the most gifted footballers never acquire them. ‘Somebody who thinks about the others, who thinks about the team, who is not selfish, not egocentric,’ said Mourinho, when asked to name a player’s most important asset. ‘When you find these guys now, it is like special birth that you find once in a while. These are the ones that you have to take really good care of.’ Chelsea supporters scramble to grab Mourinho's medal after he tossed it into the crowd in 2006 . When he won his last Premier League title, in 2006, Mourinho threw his medal into the crowd. Perhaps he did not expect to wait so long for the next one. ‘I’m not the kind of guy that wants to celebrate a lot the title. I always believe that’s not the last one,’ he said. ‘Football is an industry where people have a short memory, so for me the measure of my success is to win the next match. ‘I have the dream job. I love it. I don’t need motivation. I like to train, I like to study opponents, I like to play, I like to analyse the game, I like the feeling of a victory, I like the reaction after defeat. I like everything. ‘If I finished today, what I’ve done would be enough to be a successful manager but, I prefer to think that the next game is the most important thing, and the next title is the most important thing.” Jose Mourinho was speaking to Clare Balding as part of a BT Sport Christmas Day double-bill of ‘Clare Balding Meets’ which features exclusive interviews with Mourinho and Sir Alex Ferguson.
