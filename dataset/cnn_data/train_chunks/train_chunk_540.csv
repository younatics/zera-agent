Princess Diana’s favourite fashion designer Catherine Walker left her entire estate of more than £4million to her husband. French-born Ms Walker, who died aged 65 in September 2010, produced more than 1,000 outfits for the Princess from her Chelsea headquarters over 16 years. Diana was even buried in one of her black dresses, which she bought just weeks before she died in a car crash in Paris in 1997.

The Duchess of Cambridge wore the Catherine Walker dress to a tree planting ceremony in July last year . The Duchess of Cambridge has followed in the footsteps of her  late mother-in-law by wearing Catherine Walker outfits and her mother, Carole, wore one to her daughter’s wedding to Prince  William last year. Ms Walker designed dresses and ball gowns for many of the world’s most beautiful women. Known for her discretion, her other high-profile clients included Shakira Caine, Darcey Bussell, Joely Richardson and Queen Noor of Jordan. Probate records released more than two years after her death reveal that the reclusive and hard- working Ms Walker left a net estate of £4,162,572. Her will, drawn up in 2003, left everything to her second husband and business partner Sayeed Ismail, 68, a former lecturer at the Chelsea School of Art. Nothing was left to her two daughters, Naomi and Marianne, from her marriage to her first husband John Walker, a solicitor who died in an accident in 1975 at the age of 32. But the will stated that her daughters should inherit everything if Sayeed had died before her. It is believed it was constructed to  maximise the size of her estate as legacies to a spouse are free of inheritance tax.

Shamed former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn has celebrated his six million dollar pay-off to a hotel maid who accused him of trying to rape her - by cavorting with three blonde models at a Paris nightclub. The disgraced 64-year-old economist was caught on camera brazenly posing with the attractive young women during a night out with pals in the French capital. Strauss-Kahn hit the town with five friends on Saturday after reaching the £3.8 million deal with New York hotel cleaner Nafissatou Diallo to settle her civil action for sexual assault. Celebration: Shamed former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn has celebrated his six million dollar pay-off to a hotel maid who accused him of trying to rape her - by cavorting with three blonde models at a Paris nightclub . They are both expected to appear before a judge in the Bronx on December 7 to sign the papers that will end all legal action against him in the US. But the cash-strapped Frenchman is so hard up he may have to borrow half the money from his multi-millionaire estranged wife, French daily Le Monde said. Accuser: Nafissatou Diallo maintained her claims the she was the victim of a 'violent, sadistic attack,' despite criminal charges being dropped . Meanwhile in France, Strauss-Kahn - a self-confessed sex addict - is also waiting to learn if he will face charges of conspiring with pimps to procure girls for sex parties around the world. A judge in Lille will rule on December 19 whether he should stand trial over the accusations. Strauss-Kahn - once tipped as a future president of France - seemed unworried by his ongoing legal woes as he relaxed at the chic Le Matignon night spot. He and his friends mingled with models, who were at the club to promote a new ready-made cocktail called Sex on the Beach. A reveller at the club told France’s Europe 1 radio: 'Strauss-Kahn arrived at the club at about 10.30pm with five or six other men and two bodyguards. 'They sat at a table in the VIP area before going down to the nightclub floor itself.' Jean-Albert Vergnaud, boss of the Sex on the Beach drinks company, added: 'Mr Strauss-Kahn seemed to love our brand, and happily posed for pictures. 'Despite what some people have said, these photos are not faked and he was genuinely there that evening enjoying himself. 'It was a bit of a marketing coup for us too.' Strauss-Kahn has been embroiled in a catalogue of sex scandals since being arrested in May 2011 for trying to rape Guinea immigrant Miss Diallo, 29, when she came to clean his suite in New York’s Sofitel hotel. He was charged with attempted rape, sexual abuse, a criminal sexual act, unlawful imprisonment and forcible touching and held at the city’s notorious Ryker’s Island prison. He claimed Ms Diallo had consented to sex but later described the encounter as ‘a moral failure’ that he would regret his whole life. All charges were then dropped a month later over concerns about the cleaner’s credibility. She went on to file a civil case against him for what she called a ‘violent and sadistic attack’ that humiliated and degraded her, and ‘robbed her of her dignity as a woman’. Loan: . With no income or savings, Strauss-Kahn may have to ask . multi-millionaire heiress Anne Sinclair, his 63-year-old wife who left . him in the summer, for half of the money . Miss Sinclair, also 63, a heiress and . former television presenter who now runs a Paris website, originally . put up a £624,000 deposit and £3.1million bond to get Strauss-Kahn out . of the notorious Rikers Island prison in May 2011 after his arrest at . the Sofitel hotel in Manhattan. At the time, she insisted her husband was innocent, but the couple who have a daughter Camille, and had been married for 20 years, split . up in the summer. Strauss-Kahn also faces legal woes in France, where he returned after criminal charges were dropped, only to face similar accusations of sexually abusing a young French writer. Moving on: Dominique Strauss-Khan seen with his new partner Myriam Aouffir earlier this year . When those allegations were also abandoned, he was then confronted with more claims he used hookers supplied by a vice network in Lille, northern France. Strauss-Kahn confessed to attending many group sex sessions but insisted he did not know the young women were hookers and that he often had sex with ‘willing girls’ in their 20s. He is now under ‘judicial control’ on £85,000 bail pending a decision on whether he should face trial. The hugely experienced economist has meanwhile made a discreet return to public life, giving a speech on the global finances in China and advising the Greek government on their massive debts.","Shamed former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn has celebrated by cavorting with three blonde models at a Paris nightclub .

Spokesperson Clare Morrison said: 'There is never a need for a family car to . be able to reach speeds of 190mph, or even 100mph. 'While fast cars can . be enticing, going fast should only ever be encouraged on race tracks. 'Speed is a factor in all road deaths and injury, as the faster you go, . the harder you hit. 'Driving above speed limits, or too fast for . conditions, is plain dangerous and causes many deaths and catastrophic . injuries on roads every year. 'That’s why Brake urges all drivers to . drive under speed limits at all times, and go even slower when . conditions call for it such as outside schools and homes or in bad . weather; to do otherwise is inviting disaster.' A spokesperson for Audi said: 'There are numerous cars capable of exceeding UK national speed limits but all German cars are designed to cope with the de-restricted sections of Autobahn. 'Many of our customers appreciate the safety and stability designed into these cars which are, in effect, over-engineered for British Roads.

North Korea has repaired flood damage at its nuclear test facility and could conduct a quick atomic explosion if it chose - and could trigger a detonation in as little as two weeks. But water streaming out of a test tunnel may cause problems at the site, analysis of recent satellite photos has found. Leaders in Washington and around the world are braced for the possibility that if punished for a successful long-range rocket launch on December 12, that the UN considers a cover for a banned ballistic missile test, North Korea's next step might be its third nuclear test. This satellite image taken Nov. 19, 2012 by DigitalGlobe shows the entrance area of the Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Facility in North Korea, where experts suspect Pyongyang will conduct its next detonation. Analysts claim tyre tracks now run from the bypass road to the southern area support buildings, the new bridge appears to be wider than before and the tent cover has been raised with the snowfall. Rocket and nuclear tests unnerve . Washington and its allies because each new success puts North Korean . scientists another step closer to perfecting a nuclear warhead small . enough to put on a missile that could hit the mainland United States. North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, pictured. It is feared his next step might be a third nuclear test after a test facility was repaired . Another nuclear test, which North Korea's Foreign Ministry hinted at on the day of the rocket launch, would fit a pattern. Pyongyang conducted its first and second atomic explosions, in 2006 and 2009, weeks after receiving UN Security Council condemnation and sanctions for similar long-range rocket launches. North Korea is thought to have enough plutonium for a handful of crude atomic bombs, and unveiled a uranium enrichment facility in 2010, but it must continue to conduct tests to master the miniaturisation technology crucial for a true nuclear weapons program. 'With an additional nuclear test, North Korea could advance their ability to eventually deploy a nuclear weapon on a long-range missile,' said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the nongovernment Arms Control Association. Analysts caution that only so much can be determined from satellite imagery, and it's very difficult to fully discern North Korea's plans. This is especially true for nuclear test preparations, which are often done deep within a mountain. North Korea, for instance, took many by surprise when it launched its rocket this month only several days after announcing technical problems. Although there's no sign of an imminent nuclear test, U.S. and South Korean officials worry that Pyongyang could conduct one at any time. Analysis of GeoEye and Digital Globe satellite photos from December 13 and earlier, provided to The Associated Press by 38 North, the website for the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, said scientists are 'determined to maintain a state of readiness' at the Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Facility after repairing flood damage. This satellite image taken on December 2 shows the traffic flow pattern at the Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Facility in North Korea. The 38 North Analysis says the road is dark where movement has melted the snow, and the traffic appears limited to the bypass road, the tunnel entrance and the two southern area support buildings. The nuclear speculation comes as South Korea's conservative president-elect, Park Geun-hye, prepares to take office in February, and as young North Korean leader Kim Jong Un marks his one-year anniversary as supreme commander. Kim has consolidated power since taking over after his father, Kim Jong Il, died Dec. 17, 2011, and the rocket launch is seen as a major internal political and popular boost for the 20-something leader. Some analysts, however, question whether Kim will risk international, and especially Chinese, wrath and sure sanctions by quickly conducting a nuclear test. The election in South Korea and Barack Obama's re-election to a second term as US president could prompt North Korea to try more diplomacy than military options, some believe. Yong-seok, an analyst at the Institute for Peace Affairs, a private think tank in Seoul. 'I think we'll see North Korea more focused on economic revival than on nuclear testing next year.' The 38 North analysis said the North 'may be able to trigger a detonation in as little as two weeks, once a political decision is made to move forward.' But the report by Jack Liu, Nick Hansen and Jeffrey Lewis also said it was unclear whether water seepage from a tunnel entrance at the site was under control. Water could hurt a nuclear device and the sensors needed to monitor a test. The analysis also identified what it called a previously unidentified structure that could be meant to protect sensitive equipment from bad weather. 'We don't have a crystal ball that will tell us when the North will conduct its third nuclear test,' said Joel Wit, a former U.S. State Department official and now editor of 38 North. 'But events over the next few months, such as the U.N. reaction to Pyongyang's missile test and the North's unfolding policy toward the new South Korean government, may at least provide us with some clues.' Another unknown is how China, the North's only major ally, would respond to calls for tighter sanctions. Washington views more pressure from Beijing as pivotal if diplomatic pressure is going to force change in Pyongyang. Even if Beijing signs on to UN punishment if the North conducts a test, there may be less hurt for Pyongyang than Washington wants. The impact of tougher sanctions would be 'a drop in the bucket compared with the tidal wave of China-North Korean trade' that has risen sharply since 2008, even as inter-Korean trade has remained flat, said John Park, a Korea expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Trade figures show North Korea's deepening dependence on China. Pyongyang's trade with Beijing surged more than 60 percent last year, reaching $5.63 billion, according to South Korea's Statistics Korea. China accounted for 70 percent of North Korea's annual trade in 2011, up from 57 percent in 2010. North Korea's 2006 nuclear test had an estimated explosive yield of 1 kiloton. The Los Alamos National Laboratory estimated in 2011 that the North's test on May 25, 2009, which followed U.N. condemnation of an April long-range rocket launch, had a minimum yield of 5.7 kilotons. The atomic bomb that hit Nagasaki at the end of World War II was about 21 kilotons. Both North Korean tests used plutonium for fissile material. Without at least one more successful plutonium test, it's unlikely that Pyongyang could have confidence in a miniaturized plutonium design, according to an August paper by Frank Pabian of Los Alamos and Siegfried Hecker of Stanford University. North Korea's small plutonium stockpile is sufficient for four to eight bombs, they wrote, but it may be willing to sacrifice some if it can augment information from the previous tests. Pabian and Hecker predicted that Pyongyang may simultaneously test both plutonium and highly enriched uranium devices. A uranium test would worry the international community even more, as it would confirm that North Korea, which would need months to restart its shuttered plutonium reactor, has an alternative source of fissile material based on uranium enrichment. North Korea unveiled a previously secret uranium enrichment plant in November 2010. 'Whether and when North Korea conducts another nuclear test will depend on how high a political cost Pyongyang is willing to bear,' Mr Pabian and Mr Hecker wrote. Another test would also undermine Pyongyang's assertion that its long-range rocket launches are for a peaceful space program and not what outsiders see as the development of ballistic missiles that could eventually deliver nuclear weapons. On the same day as this month's rocket launch, an unidentified North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman told state media that a hostile U.S. response to a failed launch in April of this year had forced Pyongyang 'to re-examine the nuclear issue as a whole. The statement was a clear threat to detonate a nuclear device ahead of any U.N. Security Council action, said Baek Seung-joo, an analyst at the state-run Korea Institute for Defense Analyses in Seoul.","Discovery of repair comes from an analysis of satellite images .

Most of us have an old PC lying around, which, until now, may be destined for the scrap heap. But as Nvidia's Ben Berraondo explains, for a modest sum, this humble unit can be turned into a powerful games machine - making it a very affordable alternative to aging mainstream consoles. 'You don’t need a Gruffalo-esque PC to enjoy games looking their best,' he says. Stunning: Graphics on consoles are limited to their hardware, but PCs offer sharper images with heaps more detail and longer draw distances . 'In fact, more often than not, it can take just one small upgrade to your old family PC and bring Full High Definition PC gaming goodness to your home. That upgrade is the graphics card.' One big advantage on playing games on PC is that games will have much better graphics. Advancements in graphics card technology means where console graphics are limited to their hardware, PC graphics have continued to improve. Assassin's Creed 3, for example runs on Direct X 11 - resulting in anti-aliasing technology, higher-resolution textures and draw distances. The beauty is in the detail: This screenshot shows how anti-aliasing works on an image. Notice the jagged lines of the first picture. In the second, multi-sample anti-aliasing is used, improving image quality. The third shows temporal anti-aliasing, developed to give 'movie-style' quality to images . Anti-aliasing removes jagged lines, and helps smooth edges, while Tessellation allows for environments and objects to have greater surface detail. Thankfully, changing the graphics card is remarkably easy. 'Simply slide off the PC side-cover (many don’t even have screws nowadays) and find your PCI-E slot - don’t worry about the name, it’s either going to be empty or have a graphics card already in there,' explains Ben. 'Take the old card out (if one is already in there), plug in your shiny new card, close up your PC, turn it on and point your web browser to www.GeForce.co.uk. Looking their best: For those considering an aging current gen console, likely to be replaced by newer models next year, an upgraded PC may be a better investment . NVIDIA will even help you automatically find your right drivers (these are what makes the graphics work) and then you’re all set and ready to ‘press start’! Graphics cards range in price and performance and can work out a lot cheaper than a buying a mainstream console. 'As a minimum I’d go for around £100 which will get you an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 650 Ti, taking you to another level if you’re used to an Xbox 360 or a PS3,' says Ben. 'Going a bit further up to £160 will get you a GeForce GTX 660 which will enable you to ramp up all the settings to ""high"" to get even better visuals.' 'Finally, if you can stretch to £230, you’ll be able to get a GeForce GTX 660 Ti – this means silky smooth games at over ""1080P"" – full HD resolution. 'if you’ve bought your PC in the past 3 or 4 years then you should be ready to go.' Sound investment: Even with a £100 graphics card, you'll notice a much cleaner, sharper image . There are other graphics cards from other developers available, too. AMD, another giant in the graphics market, have their Radeon series, with the 6450, 6570 and 6670. Prices vary depending on performance, although most now support Direct X 11. A Radeon HD 5850 may be a slightly older card (and does not support Direct X 11), but still delivers strong graphics in games such as Crysis - a title renowned for setting the bench mark for visuals. Coming in at just over £100, this is a viable alternative. There may be some other factors to consider, too. If your PC is older, then you may need to upgrade the power supply, motherboard and cooling system to deal with the new graphics card. While, given the fact that PCs are capable of displaying images at varying resolutions, a monitor upgrade may be needed if you're to get optimum visual quality. Lastly, RAM (or random access memory) is used to store the game's information, with many games stating a minimum amount. More RAM can be added, and you'll likely see an increase in performance. Given that current gen console successors are likely to be announced later next year, a PC upgrade could be a sound investment. However, if your PC is too old, buying a new one may still work out cheaper in the long run. Although it will be slightly more expensive than buying a console this Christmas, it's likely to 'future-proof' your hardware to deal with the demanding 2013 games line-up - proving cheaper than shelling out for both existing and future consoles.

Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles is finalising a deal with unions to rein in pensions spending . Families will be able to spread their council tax payments into 12 monthly instalments rather than ten after rules that benefited local authorities were scrapped. From April, residents in England will be able to evenly spread out the annual costs of their council tax all year. Most councils make residents pay their council tax across ten months, in larger payments, to ensure they have all the money in before the end of the financial year. The move to evenly spread the payments will lower the average B and D council tax payment by £24 per month – although the total amount paid annually will remain unchanged. Legislation passed by the  Government will allow council tax payers to make the request for 12 individual monthly payments, making it easier for households to budget. Currently only some local authorities allow these requests, but in these cases families often have to prove financial hardship. Council tax in England will be frozen for the third year in a row in 2014-15. Local authorities will also get £450million from the Government to help them with funding the freeze. They will also be able to charge an empty-homes premium on homes left vacant for two years or more. Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said: ‘We know many people are worried about their cost of living expenses and we’ve already acted to freeze council tax in the past two years after bills. ‘We have also changed the rules so hard-working council residents can choose to pay their annual bills online or spread payments over 12 monthly instead of ten. ‘These sensible measures will make paying easier.’",Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles says move will help families struggling with living expenses .

Police are hunting a dognapping gang after pedigree animals worth thousands of pounds were stolen in a series of burglaries. Officers have stepped up patrols in Hampshire after three cocker spaniels were snatched from separate properties in the space of 24 hours. There were also suspicious sightings of intruders and cars near kennels in the county over the weekend, leading to fears that an organised gang is at work. Maisie is one of two cocker spaniels stolen from a hose in Winchester worth £600 each . Cocker spaniel Tia, aged nine months, was also stolen . The latest theft saw two cocker spaniels snatched from their kennels in Owslebury, near Winchester, at 3am  yesterday. Their owner was woken by the sound of barking and found that 14-month-old Maisie and nine-month-old Tia were missing. Maisie was described as very lean with a docked tail and of orange roam colour while Tia is chocolate-coloured with a white flash on her chest. Both dogs are microchipped and worth £600 each. The previous night, burglars broke into the back garden of a home in Bullington, near Andover, between 7.30pm and 10.30pm and forced entry into a kennel of five dogs. They stole a six-year-old black and white male cocker spaniel called Jarvis, worth £1,500. Cocker spaniels are a favourite breed among celebrities including actor Martin Clunes . It . followed two incidents in November when two English springer spaniels . were stolen from a back garden in Holbury, and another dog was held for . ransom for a week in Thornhill, Hampshire. Two other suspicious incidents were reported to police over the weekend. A . man was scared away from kennels at a house in Beauworth, Hampshire, at . 10pm on Sunday, while a vehicle was seen stopped at kennels in nearby . Ovington at 1am on Monday before driving away. Police officers have stepped up patrols in the rural areas and warned owners to make sure all animals are kept securely and have been micro-chipped. Sergeant Mark Lamper said: ‘During the festive period, more animals are purchased for pets. If you do buy a dog, please ensure you know the history as you may be purchasing someone else’s pet without knowing.’ Earlier this year, it emerged that high-value pedigree dogs across Hampshire were being stolen on a regular basis. Dog rescue groups warned that the expensive pets were being taken for breeding, hunting and to be sold on, while some said they were used for illegal dog-fighting. In a separate incident on Monday, a white van was seen moving slowly through the streets of Iden, East Sussex, before George, a brown and black Yorkshire terrier, was snatched from a garden shed. Officers are not immediately linking the theft to those in Hampshire, but have not ruled out the possibility. Cocker spaniels are a desirable breed that sell for an average of £800 but can reach up to £1,500. They are a favourite with celebrities, including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who have a one-year-old black cocker spaniel called Lupo. Other celebrity fans include actor Martin Clunes – who took his beloved dog Mary on television appearances with him and who now has a second cocker spaniel – and flamboyant interior designer Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen.","Officers step up patrols after three thefts in Hampshire in space of 24 hours .

Adults can't be forced to stay in treatment, and most leave the shelters within three days. But children are kept in treatment against their will or returned to parents if they have a family. In December, 119 children were being held in specialized treatment units. Demand for crack has boomed in recent years and open-air 'cracolandias,' or 'crack lands,' popped up in the urban centers of Rio and Sao Paulo, with hundreds of users gathering to smoke the drug. The federal government announced in early 2012 that more than $2 billion would be spent to fight the epidemic, allotting money to train health care workers, buy thousands of hospital and shelter beds, and create transitional centers for recovering users.

The song, featuring its moody dry-ice filled black and white video, was originally kept off the top spot by novelty track Shaddap You Face by the US-born Australian Joe Dolce. But the song, released in January 1981, has now triumphed in a national poll by Radio 2 and the Official Charts Company to find the greatest track to narrowly miss out on the top slot. Top of the pops: Vienna, by Ultravox, has been named as the all time best single which narrowly missed out on the top spot when initially released .

'A huge thanks to everyone who took the time and effort to vote for Vienna.

There is a 50:50 chance that Britain will slide into a devastating triple-dip recession this year, leading economists warn today. Output ‘probably’ fell in the final three months of 2012 and could do so again in the first three months of 2013, said the Centre for Economics and Business Research. Another two quarters of decline in a row would mean the third recession in five years and set the scene for another bleak year. Crisis: The UK could suffer a triple-dip recession with the crisis in the eurozone proving a major challenge for the economy . The think-tank singled out the crisis in the eurozone as ‘a major challenge for the UK economy’, given it is Britain’s biggest trading partner. A weak recovery in Britain would blow a gaping hole in its creaking finances and cost the country its coveted AAA credit rating. Business leaders will today call for ‘bold moves’ from ministers to unleash growth in 2013 – including investment in infrastructure and an assault on red tape. John Longworth, of the British Chambers of Commerce, will say the Government risks doing ‘too little too late’ to bolster the economy and get young people into work. Cutting defecit?: George Osborne will struggle to cut Government borrowing and get national debt under control . ‘We need a clear, agreed and long-term push to improve Britain’s business environment before we reach a point of no return – leading to decades of stagnation and further decline,’ he will add. City economists are predicting growth of only 1.1 per cent in 2013 and 1.7 per cent in 2014, followed by 2 per cent in 2015 and 2.1 per cent in 2016. That is far weaker than expected by the Treasury and will leave George Osborne struggling to cut government borrowing and get the ballooning national debt under control. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the government’s official forecaster, last month predicted growth of 1.2 per cent in 2013 and 2 per cent in 2014, followed by 2.3 per cent in 2015 and 2.7 per cent in 2016. Erik Britton, of financial research group Fathom Consulting, said the forecasts were too optimistic. ‘The outlook for growth is very weak. Bumping along the bottom is the order of the day, and double, triple, quadruple, and n-tuple dips are the likely corollary,’ he added. Such an outcome would wreak havoc with the Chancellor’s plans to cut borrowing, having inherited a record deficit of £159billion from Labour. Borrowing fell to £142billion in the Coalition’s first year in power and again to £121billion last year but the decline has not been as fast as Mr Osborne predicted. He now hopes to cut the annual deficit to £31billion by 2017-18 – but this will require yet more austerity and could prove optimistic if the recovery does not live up to the Treasury’s expectations. The CEBR warns that the deficit will be around £75billion in 2017-18 and the Chancellor will borrow almost £100billion more than expected between now and then – pushing the national debt to ever more dangerous levels.","Output will 'probably' fall in the first three months of 2013 .

Mothers with full-time jobs spend four months of the year working to cover their childcare costs, according to research. They must work for 17 weeks to raise enough money to pay the nursery or childminder as fees spiral. Annual bills for a full-time place have reached £24,000 at the country’s most expensive nurseries – on a par with the fees charged by prestigious boarding schools. Mothers with a full-time job need to work for up to four months of the year just to break even on their childcare costs . But growing numbers of women are . accepting the mounting charges to bring in more money for their families . as the cost of living rises and house prices remain high. Research by trust fund provider Family . Investments found families pay £7,127 a year on average for a full-time . place at a day nursery or childminder for only one child. A mother would need to work for 17 weeks on average to break even and recoup these costs. But the analysis found sharp regional . variations, with mothers in the South West and South East having to work . the longest to cover their costs. Those in the South West pay £7,228 on . average per year for childcare but earn £10.72 an hour, meaning they . must work for 18.6 weeks to cover the charges. In the South East, women must work for 17.9 weeks to break even. West Midlands . North West . Mothers living in the North tend to need to work for a week less a year than those living in the South of England to break even on their childcare costs . Although those in London face the . highest annual childcare costs, at £9,283 per year on average, they also . have the highest wages, earning £15.07 an hour, meaning they must work . for 16.9 weeks to cover childcare. Mothers in the south of England tend . to have to work one week more than those in the north to recoup care . costs – but those in Yorkshire and Humberside had to work for an . above-average 17.7 weeks. Kate Moore, of Family Investments, said: . ‘These figures highlight the very significant costs mums face if they . choose to return to work after maternity leave and the fact that they . will spend up to four months of the year simply working towards these . costs. ‘Mums can get up to 15 hours of care . per week for free once their child turns three, but for the first couple . of years parents must saddle these costs on their own. ‘What really jumps out from these figures is both the scale of the costs involved and the disparities in local affordability.’ The latest research is based on . mothers who work a 36.3 hour week and receive no help from Government . schemes to help working parents, such as tax credits. It also assumed parents were not accepting childcare vouchers, which allow them to pay for childcare out of pre-tax wages. Previous studies have found that working mothers in Britain face some of the highest childcare costs in the developed world. Charities claim the tax and benefits system is skewed to make childcare costs a particular burden for middle-income families. The Mail revealed last month that, . according to the latest census figures, the stay-at-home mother is . becoming consigned to history. Fewer than one in ten women of working . age are stay-at-home mothers, down from 12 per cent in 2002 and a . complete reversal on the 1970s, where most women with young families . stayed at home. But a survey of new mothers by analyst Mintel suggests the tide may be turning amid a lack of affordable childcare places. It found that the proportion of . mothers deciding to stay at home rather than return to work has surged . from 18 to 24 per cent in only a year. Ina Mitskavets, of Mintel, said: . ‘Affordability of childcare, or lack of, is keeping lower-income mums . and those with more children at home.’ But she added that the rising cost of . living continued to place women under enormous pressure to go back to . work when their babies are very young. ‘Job security is highly prized in the . current climate of uncertainty with many mothers returning to work . within the 12 months that their job has to be legally held open for . them,’ she said. The Coalition has launched a commission, which is due to report soon, to recommend ways to overhaul the childcare system.","Mothers in the South West work on average 19 weeks a year before the cost of a childcare is covered .

Fifth-grader Rachel Neely, from Bright, Indiana, put the blue Kool Aid streaks in her hair at a weekend sleepover friends. According to the Sunman-Dearborn Intermediate School student handbook, unnatural hair colour is in breach of school rules but despite the best efforts of her father they were unable to get the dye out. Scroll down for video . Shock: Rachel Neely was told she had been suspended after home remedies failed to remove the blue streaks from her hair. Single dad Charles Neely said he got the shock of his life when Rachel came home from school with a note confirming she had been suspended. It added that she wouldn't be allowed back into class until ever last bit of colour had been removed from her hair. ‘When she got home from school today the first thing she said was, 'Dad, I've been suspended because of my hair.' I was aghast,’ he told 9 News, adding that while he accepted the dress code he thought the punishment was a little extreme. Extreme: The note said Rachel wouldn't be allowed back to school until all the blue was out of her hair. ‘Do I bite the bullet and take her to a . salon and have her hair professionally coloured? Will she be . re-suspended when that colour grows out and then half her hair is blonde . again?’ Tomorrow Charles will go to school with Rachel to ask principle Chris Vennemeier what can be done about his daughter’s hair.

Swap: The traditional red poppy should be replaced with white poppies according to actor Mark Rylance . The traditional red poppy should be replaced with white poppies on  Remembrance Sunday according to actor Mark Rylance. He believes the white poppy should be worn to commemorate civilian victims rather than Britain's military dead, with red poppies making war seem 'inevitable.' Traditionally the red flower is worn every . November as a mark of respect to war veterans, members of the Armed . Forces who have lost their lives, and their families. Every year 40 million red paper poppies . are made and sold by the Royal British Legion, with all the money raised . providing support for the Armed Forces and their families. But Mr Rylance, a former artistic director of Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, said he decided to wear white because 90 per cent of casualties of war are now civilians, not soldiers, according to The Daily Telegraph. If the country is to remember 'the tragedy of war' every year, civilian casualties should be recognised, he told he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The flower was chosen as a symbol of . remembrance in the aftermath of the First World War, during which the . shells and shrapnel which fell on the trenches and craters of Flanders . led to a mass of poppies covering the killing fields. Mr Rylance, said he had 'enormous . sympathy' for the suffering of soldiers and their families. Decision: Mr Rylance said he believes the white poppy should be worn to commemorate civilian victims rather than Britain's military dead . But he added: 'I think it's a slightly . different thing if you sign up to go out and fight in one of these wars . and you know that 90 per cent of the people who are going to suffer will . be civilian people who have not signed up to the war. 'So it is a . slightly different thing if you have agreed to be part of it than if . you are just a bystander or a child or people at a wedding who get hurt. He said he was concerned that the red poppy had 'become a way of raising money to cover the cost that I think the . government or perhaps the arms manufacturers themselves would be better . to pay for.' Honouring the dead: The Queen lays a wreath at the Cenotaph in London in 2012 . The White Poppy was first introduced by the Women's Co-operative Guild in 1933 and was intended as a lasting symbol for peace and an end to all wars. It was was produced by the Co-operative Wholesale Society because the Royal British Legion had refused to be associated with its manufacture. But many veterans felt that its significance undermined their contribution and the lasting meaning of the red poppy. Such was the seriousness of this issue that some women lost their jobs in the 1930s for wearing white poppies.

Message: Care Minister Norman Lamb says that some pensioners have a dismal existence and Britain must build a less neglectful society . Neglect by families and neighbours is to blame for elderly people having to endure dismal lives in care homes, the minister in charge of social care has said. Norman Lamb said older Britons could lead independent lives at home, if only they had more support from relatives. Instead, many are never visited at home and are ‘pushed’ into care, Mr Lamb said. The Lib Dem MP’s comments came as Age UK warned it was ‘critical’ that legislation was introduced to improve the lives of older people. Mr Lamb’s criticism of ‘neglectful’ families was met by an angry response from Labour, which accused the Coalition minister of dismissing the many carers who voluntarily look after loved ones. The minister urged local authorities to rebuild ‘neighbourly resilience’ to stop old people leading lonely lives, instead of expecting the state to ‘do everything’. This would also reduce the burden on the state as fewer people would need to be housed in residential care. Mr Lamb said: ‘We all have a part to play. ‘In this way, we can make the system sustainable, and it can be a more decent society, a less neglectful society than we sometimes experience where we just expect the state to do everything.’ He suggested that more could be done to stop the elderly from going in to homes. ‘The system pushes them there,’ he said. ‘The system does not do enough to help them maintain their independence.’ Mr Lamb added: ‘With the right support and the right community resilience, and a rebuilding of the neighbour support that used to be there, more people could stay in their own homes for longer.’ Britain had ‘lost the extended family because families have become dispersed’, he said. ‘If someone is living on their own never seeing anyone, that is a dismal existence, and it often ends up with it all collapsing and them going into a care home. ‘Give them support, some companionship, and help them maintain activity in mind and body and everyone benefits.’ He suggested that more councils should follow the example of Leeds, where elderly people are given grants so that they can adapt their homes to stay living in them independently. Liz Kendall, Labour’s spokesman for care and older people said: ‘Britain’s six million unpaid family carers aren’t being neglectful of their loved ones and they don’t expect the state to do everything – far from it. ‘They look after their frail elderly and disabled relatives day in day out, often with precious little help and support. ‘Instead of blaming families for the care crisis, the Government should be facing up to its responsibilities by putting in place a decent and fair system for funding social care now and in future.’ Mr Lamb also confirmed that the Government would announce a cap on care fees, expected to be around £75,000, above which the state will pay. Warning: The elderly are ending up in care too easily people should be more 'neighbourly' so they can stay in their own homes, Mr Lamb said . However, he warned that the new . funding agreement was ‘not a panacea’ and ‘does not remove all financial . pressures’ as people would still have to pay for the accommodation . component of living in a care home. Currently, anyone with assets of more than £23,500 faces unlimited charges. Critics warn that with middle-class . couples facing a total outlay of as much as £200,000, many elderly . people may still be forced to sell their homes even with the new cap. Age UK urged the Government to adopt new legislation in order to improve the lives of the elderly. The campaign group called for a flat basic state pension and for older people in care to be treated with dignity. The call for action by the Government . follows a recent report by a commission looking into dignity in care . which said old people were patronised in care homes and often treated as . a medical condition rather than as a person. In a statement, Age UK said: ‘We must . make sure older people are supported to live happy and healthy lives . through equal access to appropriate prevention, treatment and . rehabilitation services. ‘We need to work together to ensure that they are supported to meet their aspirations and to live rewarding later lives.’","Norman Lamb says Britain needs a 'less neglectful society'

Goodman, head judge on BBC1's dance show, had been with Sue Barrett, 47, a dance teacher, for more than ten years. It's third time lucky for Goodman. At 28, he married his champion dance partner Cherry, but they divorced a few years later. He then had a long-term partner, Lesley, with whom he had a son, James. He told the Daily Mail yesterday: 'I've had a marvellous day, and now my gorgeous Sue is the new Mrs Goodman. 'Did I pickle my walnuts? Of course I did! I wanted it to be a low-key affair, so we didn't tell anyone except my 96-year-old mum as I didn't want her having a heart attack with the surprise.' Asked if he got down on one knee, he laughed and replied: 'At my age, no way! I made her go four stairs above me on the staircase so at least she was taller than me, does that count? Dancing duo: Len Goodman with his first wife and champion dancing partner Cherry Kingston . The long-term girlfriend: Goodman's second partner, Lesley, with whom he had a son, James . 'We've had a marvellous day, with marvellous food surrounded by all my dearest friends – and it didn't go on for too long so it didn't get boring!' Among the guests was close friend and Strictly professional Anton du Beke. He and Goodman celebrated afterwards with a little waltz outside exclusive Mosimann's private dining club in London's Belgravia. The dancer, who arrived with a glamorous blonde on his arm, said: 'I didn't know a thing about Len getting married. It was a complete surprise – hilarious really, but completely marvellous.' Aside from Du Beke, the ceremony was a distinctly unstarry affair. Friends: Goodman at his London wedding with guest and fellow Strictly Come Dancing star Anton Du Beke . Absent: Strictly presenters Tess Daly and Sir Bruce Forsyth and Goodman's fellow judges were not at the wedding . Tess Daly, Sir Bruce Forsyth and Goodman's fellow judges Bruno Tonioli, Darcey Bussell and Craig Revel Horwood were all absent. Not that the wedding – which cost £25,000 – lacked glamour. Guests were treated to a champagne reception on the mezzanine balcony overlooking the central restaurant, which Goodman paid £10,000 to hire. The couple, both dressed in blue, were married in a private room by Westminster superintendent registrar  Alison Cathcart. After the short ceremony at 2pm, their guests sat down to a sumptuous five-course lunch. There was a choice of prawn cocktail or Asian-style pumpkin soup to start, followed by mushroom risotto. For the main course guests could . choose between seabass or English lamb with stir-fried vegetables, with . cheese and 'old school' apple crumble to finish. The happy couple then - of course - took to the floor for, as Goodman put it, 'a spot of dance-teacher dancing.' The . Strictly judge, who officially registered his intention to marry in . August, said: 'I've been going out with my lovely Sue for  ages and I . decided it was time to pop  the question.

"By . Damien Gayle . UPDATED: . 16:57 EST, 8 February 2012 . A former soldier spent six months out of work after hitting a pub punchball machine so hard it severed tendons in his hand. David Forster, 32, scored a respectable 900 points out of 1,000 when he struck the arcade machine at Sam Jack's pub in Newcastle with a savage right-hander. But the impact split his hand from finger to wrist and severed tendons - leaving him permanently disfigured and unable to work for six months. Ouch: Former soldier David Forster shows off his hand which he injured playing a pub punch ball machine . Now the former Coldstream Guard is suing the bar for £8,000 in damages for the injury. He said: 'As soon as I made contact with the punch ball my hand split open and there was blood everywhere. 'I tried to stem the flow by running it under the toilet tap but as soon as the water was on my hand, the pain was excruciating. 'I had only been out for a few hours and had a few pints so I was gutted that I had to end my night and go to hospital.' Mr Forster, a father of one, was out with friends on a stag night in Newcastle city centre when the incident happened at around 8pm on 18th June last year. Permanently damaged: Mr Forster was out of work for six months after the accident . The game tests players' mettle by measuring the power of a punch thrown at a padded ball suspended from the machine. Lawyers . for the pub claim Mr Forster was drunk and stumbled, missing the punch . ball and hitting the metal framework holding it in place. But Mr Forster's legal team claim CCTV footage prove he made contact with the punch ball and walked away. He . was taken by ambulance to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle . where he needed 12 stitches and a metal plate in his hand. Test of mettle: A punchbag arcade game, like the one on which Mr Forster injured his hand . Mr Forster, of Newcastle, spent five days in hospital after contracting an infection and needed plastic surgery to rebuild his hand. His fiancee Donna Bell, 31, nursed David while he had physiotherapy, two times a week for up to four months. Mr Forster, who now works as a security guard for the JobCentre added: 'I am battling for some form of compensation for my loss of earnings. 'I was out of work for six months and nearly lost my house because I was struggling to pay the mortgage. 'I will always have problems with my hand now and worry that I can no longer defend myself. 'I used to box in the army and play football a lot - I can't do any of these sports anymore.' Managers at Sam Jack's pub said they were unable to comment on Mr Forster's claim. Managers of the pub where David Forster damaged his hand on a punch ball machine said they were unable to comment on his claim. Bob Senior, managing director of Utopian Leisure group, said: 'I am unfamiliar with this incident personally. All incidents are passed on to our insurance company who deal with them. 'This is the usual procedure we follow and part of our insurance conditions. I can make no further comment.'","David Forster was left with a permanent injury after severing tendons in his hand .

Mia Rathband, 14, said she is intent following in her father's footsteps by becoming a traffic officer. PC Rathband, 44, was blinded after being shot in the face by killer Moat in July 2010 and after struggling to come to terms with his disability was found hanged in February 2012. Proud: Mia Rathband, holding her father's police hat, has set up a week of work experience with Northumbria Police . Mia, pictured with her father in 2010, said they used to have long conversations about his work in the force . Mia said: 'I know that dad would have been so proud of me. 'This time of year is very difficult for us. Last year was difficult because it was the first Christmas we had after dad had been hurt. This year is also difficult because he isn't here. 'We think about him a lot and I know he will like the fact that I want to join the police and become a traffic officer like him. 'After my dad was hurt it became more clear what I wanted to do as a job and being a police officer was an option. 'It is a good job and I want to be able to make a difference.'

The rampage sparked a week long manhunt which ended when the 37-year-old shot himself in July 2010. PC Rathband was praised for his outstanding bravery and he set up a charity, the Blue Lamp Foundation, which helps emergency services personnel injured in the line of duty.

'Big hoax': David Morrison, a senior scientist and astrobiologist at NASA's Ames Research Centre, appears in the short film to dispel doomsday rumours . Nasa tried to calm fears that doomsday is due at some point today with the release of a second video of a senior scientist dispelling the various rumours of impending apocalypse. There are fears that the end of the Mayan long count calendar, which some experts say comes today, signals the end of the world. David Morrison, a senior scientist and astrobiologist at NASA's Ames Research Centre, appears in the short film to reiterate the agency's belief that the rumours are just a 'big hoax'. It is the second video this month Nasa has released in an effort to calm fears, after it was accused of tempting fate by releasing a film dubbed Why The World Didn't End Yesterday - ten days early. However, that Nasa has seen fit to ask one of its most esteemed and learned scientists to answer the rumours shows the agency is taking seriously the possibility of mass panic. Dr Morrison says: 'Nasa has received thousands of emails and calls from members of the public who are concerned, especially young people, so it seems only right that Nasa scientists should help to dispel these rumours.' Chief among the rumours spinning across the internet is that the end of the world has been predicted by the Mayan long count calendar, which apparently completes its cycle today. 'That's simply not true,' Dr Morrison says. 'That's a modern rumour, it has nothing to do with the real Maya.' Coming to an end today: The Mayan long count calendar . Astronomical and planetary experts from the U.S. space agency explained away all the myths surrounding the end of the Mayan calender - particularly that a rogue planet was due to hit the Earth . Another widely held fear is that a . rogue planet known as Niburu or Planet X is headed for a collision . course with Earth, and that the impact will completely wipe out human . civilisation and, probably, everything else. Dr Morrison calls the rumour 'silly' pointing out that if such a planet were on headed for an impact with our . own world 'anyone could see it'. 'It would be one of the brightest things in the sky,' he adds. Less apocalyptic, but still . catastrophic, are the fears that the Earth's rotation is set to change . and the poles will flip, doing massive damage to our habitats and . civilisation. But Dr Morrison says 'this just can't happen', adding that there is 'no way' the Earth's poles could flip. The video from NASA makes the point that if a rogue planet or asteroid was about to hit the Earth we would already be able to see it with our bare eyes . Ancient Mayans believed that a 5,125-year cycle known as the Long Count would come to a close on December 21 2012. Experts estimate the system, which is made up of 394-year periods called baktuns, started counting at 3114 BC, and will have run through 13 baktuns, or 5,125 years, around December 21. They say 13 was a significant number for the Maya, and the end of that cycle would be a milestone — but they have been keen to stress that it does not mark an end. Conspiracy theorists nonetheless believe the Maya may have been privy to impending astronomical disasters that would coincide with 2012, ranging from explosive storms on the surface of the sun that could knock out power grids to a galactic alignment that could trigger a reversal in Earth's magnetic field. He goes on to discount rumours that a . planetary alignment will occur, since the planets are currently 'all . over the sky', and we are set to be gobbled up by a massive black hole, . which, he says, astronomers know is 'impossible'. To those whose fears have been exacerbated by the belief that the number of natural disasters is increasing across the planet, Dr Morrison says 'the frequency of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions is not greater now than any time in the past.' He also dispels a more recent internet rumour that Nasa has confirmed that there will be three days of total darkness beginning from tomorrow. 'Nasa didn't say that, nobody said it,' he says. 'It's just one more crazy idea.' The video was published on Tuesday, . just five days after the agency indicated it was so confident the . apocalypse was going to happen today it released a video entitled Why . The World Didn't End Yesterday. Like Dr Morrison's video, it outlined . point by point the myths surrounding the end of the Mayan calendar with . astronomical and planetary experts answering them. 'If you are watching this video then . that means one thing...the world didn't end yesterday,' began the . prematurely released video. The end-of-days prophesy is based on . an interpretation of the ancient Mayan calendar which claims the world . will end on December 21 2012.","Last week space agency accused of tempting fate after releasing Why The World Didn't End Yesterday film ten days early .

A Shetland pony who spent decades pulling carriages and sleds has retired, allowing him more time to engage in his favourite pastime - drinking pints of beer. The 28-year-old pony, called Toby, has developed tastes slightly more luxurious than a mouthful of grass, loving nothing more than munching on mince pies and drinking a pint. Toby's owner Amos Putt said he has already taken the animal to every pub in his home village of Fowey, Cornwall and now plans to spend more time with his equine friend after 20 years of work. Retired: Toby, a 28-year-old Shetland pony, enjoys nothing more than a pint and may be doing even more socialising after retiring. The pony spent 20 years working at carnivals and fetes . Companions: Toby with his owner Amos Putt from St Blazey, Cornwall. MR Putt pours beer into a plastic cup, while the pony laps it up. The 71-year-old often brings the pony to the pub to enjoy a pint with him . To consume the drink, Mr Putt pours the beer into a plastic glass and holds it while the animal laps it up. The unusual habit began when Toby worked as a carnival pony and has continued at the pair's local at St. Blazey football club. Drinking partners: Toby and Mr Putt at the Par Inn, Cornwall where they often enjoy a drink . Mr Putt, 71, a retired welder, said: 'We go out for a walk and then we go for a pint together in the pub afterwards. 'If it gets too busy he'll go outside for a drink. He doesn't get drunk. He would if he could, but I don't let him.' Toby began working shortly after Mr Putt's wife Mags died from Multiple Sclerosis, aged 45. The pony was used twice a week collecting donations . for the MS Society, before going on to work at carnivals, fetes, and charity galas. Mr Putt said Toby's last job was at a Christmas carnival where he pulled Santa on a sled. He said: 'I could tell he wasn't . enjoying it. There wasn't that sparkle in his eyes. So now he's out to . pasture. He'll have a life of leisure which he really deserves. 'Hopefully, he'll live for another three to four years and we'll have a few more pints together.' Despite his taste for ale, Mr Putt said that attempts to give the horse something stronger have backfired. He said: 'Fowey Town Band gave him several gin and tonics one year. 'People were asking what's the matter . with Toby and, when we got up to the top of the street and started . marching, the band said: ""You are going to have to put Toby at the . back"". 'They couldn't blow their instruments . because of the vile smell coming from Toby's bottom and that's the . truth. It backfired on them.' It is disputed amongst horse-owners whether beer is suitable for the animals to consume. Some myths and traditions suggest that ale has been safely mixed with horse feed for decades. But others suggest that the alcoholic content is not suitable for a horse's digestive system. Show pony: Toby spent 20 years working at carnivals and fetes.

The photographer who stumbled across the aggressive scene in a national park in Alaska said he felt like a 'dead man walking' as he watched the enormous creatures do battle just three metres away from him. Shogo Asao, 60, said the roars of the brown bears - who each towered at around 8ft tall on their hind legs - echoed around the forest as they clawed and bit one another in the wilderness.

Aggression: The bear on the left appears to dominate after landing a swipe on its rival . Mr Asao, 60, was making his way to a waterfall in Katmai National Park - famous for its brown bears - when the tussle broke out. 'Suddenly, I saw two bears watching each other and roaring,' he said. 'They quickly began fighting wildly, without noticing that I was very near to them. One ran away until it was just three metres in front of me, and the other chased it at full speed. 'They were roaring, beating, clawing and chasing each other.' The professional photographer whipped out his camera to capture the showdown. 'This is the first time I had seen such an exciting scene,' he said. 'I was so close to the violent animals that I felt like a dead man walking.'

Closest to Instagram, you'll be able to run your pics through one of eight filters with names like Warm, Cool, Vintage, Happy and Cinemati . Kevin Systrom, the CEO of the . photo-sharing service that was snapped up by Facebook earlier this year, . announced last week that Instagram has turned off support for 'Twitter . cards,' signaling a deepening rift between two of the web's biggest . brands. Twitter users . started to complain earlier this week in public messages that Instagram . photos were not displaying properly on Twitter's website. Clarifying the situation, Systrom later released a statement saying: 'We believe the best experience is for us to link back to where the content lives.' Instagram started off as a smartphone application-only service but has recently improved its website. 'A handful of months ago, we supported Twitter cards because we had a minimal web presence,' Mr Systrom said, noting that the company has since released new features that allow users to comment about and 'like' photos directly on Instagram's website. The rivalry between Facebook and Twitter intensified in April when the former outbid Twitter to nab fast-growing Instagram in a cash-and-stock deal valued at the time at $1 billion. The acquisition closed in September for roughly $715 million, due to Facebook's recent stock drop. The companies' ties have been strained since. In July, Twitter blocked Instagram from using its data to help new Instagram users find friends. No support: Twitter users will be driven to Instagram's own website by a link after Twitter cards, pictured, are scrapped . Link: Twitter users will just see a link, pictured, that will take them to the Instagram website . Photos are among the most popular features on both Facebook and Twitter, and Instagram's meteoric rise in recent years has further proved how picture-sharing has become a key front in the battle for social media supremacy. Instagram, which has 100 million users, allows consumers to tweak the photos they take on their smartphones and share the images with their friends, a feature that Twitter has reportedly also begun to develop. Twitter's executive chairman Jack Dorsey was an investor in Instagram and hoped to acquire it before Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg tabled a successful bid. When Mr Zuckerberg announced the acquisition in an April blog post, he said one of Instagram's strengths was its inter-connectivity with other social networks and pledged to continue running it as an independent service. Pledge: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg pledged to keep Instagram's ties to other social networks including Twitter, pictured, when he bought it in April . 'We think the fact that Instagram is connected to other services beyond Facebook is an important part of the experience,' Mr Zuckerberg wrote. 'We plan on keeping features like the ability to post to other social networks.' A Twitter spokesman declined to comment at the time of Instagram's announcement, but a status message on Twitter's website confirmed that users are 'experiencing issues,' such as 'cropped images' when viewing Instagram photos on Twitter. Systrom noted that Instagram users will be able to 'continue to be able to share to Twitter as they originally did before the Twitter Cards implementation.'","New features mimic Instagram's popular photo software .

A popular television satirist is being investigated for allegedly insulting the Egyptian president as Islamist lawyers continue to bring cases against outspoken media personalities in the country. TV host Bassem Youssef is accused of insulting President Mohammed Morsi by putting the Islamist leader's image on a pillow and parodying his speeches. Youssef, a doctor, catapulted to fame . when his video blogs mocking politics received hundreds of thousands of . hits shortly after the 2011 uprising that toppled longtime leader . Mubarak. Under investigation: Egyptian TV host Bassem Youssef is accused of insulting President Mohammed Morsi by parodying his speeches and printing the leader's image on a pillow . Satire: Youssef has mocked President Mohammed Morsi, pictured, and ultraconservative clerics on his video blogs . Youssef's program is modeled after Jon Stewart's 'The Daily Show', where he has appeared as a guest. Unlike other local TV presenters, . Youssef uses satire to mock fiery comments made by ultraconservative . clerics and politicians, garnering him a legion of fans among the . country's revolutionaries and liberals. Among his most popular clips are the ones where he pokes fun at the president's speeches and decisions. While holding a red, furry pillow with Morsi's picture on it, Youssef satirizes Morsi's style of speech. 'The president understands us. He . understands us better than we understand ourselves,' Youssef says in a . clip. 'He tells us things we never knew,' he adds, before going to wordy . clips of Morsi going into detail about the day of the week and other . basic facts. 'It's October 6! Tell us when it's Christmas!' Youssef shouts to the camera as the audience erupts in laughter and applause. Youssef accuses President Mohammed Morsi, pictured signing into law the country's Islamist-backed constitution, of being a dictator in one of his shows . An Egyptian woman casts her vote during a referendum on a disputed constitution drafted by Islamist supporters of President Mohammed Morsi in Fayoum, south of Cairo . In another clip filmed shortly after Morsi issued power-grabbing decrees that placed . him above judicial oversight, Youssef asks whether . Egyptians created a revolution to remove a dictator and bring in another . one. Youssef, 38, is one of Egypt's most . popular TV presenters with 1.4 million fans on Facebook and nearly . 850,000 followers on Twitter, just shy of the president's number of . followers. The case against Youssef comes as opposition media and independent journalists grow increasingly worried about press freedoms under a new constitution widely supported by Morsi and his Islamist allies. Other cases have been brought against media personalities who have criticizsd the president since Morsi's victory in the country's first free presidential election last summer. Some of the cases have ended with charges being dropped. Morsi's office maintains that the president has nothing to do with legal procedures against media critics. A local committee of journalists and editors has called for stronger guarantees of press freedoms and a rejection of the current constitution, fearing it allows for jailing journalists under broadly-worded articles regarding media offenses. Violent clashes: Opponents of Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi clash with Islamist supporters of the president ahead of voting on the country's contentious constitution that has deeply polarized the nation . Controversial: Protest were held across the country against the new constitution which places the president above judicial oversight . Authorities ordered the closure of TV station 'Al-Fareen' last summer after bringing its owner, Tawfiq Okasha, to trial for scathing attacks against Morsi and his Brotherhood group. Okasha had emerged as one of the most popular TV personalities of post-Hosni Mubarak Egypt by railing against the uprising that toppled Mubarak's 29-year rule in February 2011. Another prominent case involved the editor of a prominent opposition newspaper, al-Dustour, who has since stepped down. He went on trial briefly for 'spreading lies' and fabricating news. This latest case against a media personality comes as police today said they arrested a suspect in a shooting that seriously wounded a protester in Cairo's central Tahrir Square, where an open-ended sit-in protesting the Morsi regime is taking place. According to witnesses, before dawn on Monday, gunmen shot and wounded 19-year-old Muhanad Samir, who has said he was jailed and tortured under Egypt's former ruling military council after he witnessed the killing of another activist. Lawyers say the attacked appeared to target Samir, who is battling for his life with pellets embedded in his head. Security officials dismiss allegations Samir was the victim of a political assassination. They said they arrested the owner of a cafe in downtown Cairo who told police that he fired on the square after people manning makeshift checkpoints there searched his car and shot at him. The officials spoke anonymously in line with regulations.","TV host Bassem Youssef, 38, is one of Egypt's most .

Wreckage: Pieces of the crashed bus are seen on the snow-covered ground near the scene of the crash . Mr Seo told the Oregonian: 'Beside me was a body part. I thought she was already dead.' Seo said he was awakened by screaming . passengers and was ejected from a broken window as the bus careened down . the hill. He suffered a broken ankle, a gash in his arm that required . stitches and shallow scratches across his face. In an interview with the Associated Press, Seo added: 'Some mothers screamed to find their son or daughter.' Berlyn Sanderson, 22, of Surrey, . British Columbia, said she and several other passengers were ejected. 'It's kind of like one of those dreams you have of the world ending,' she told The Associated Press. Probe: Investigators will now examine how the bus left the road, the condition of the road at the time, the condition of the guardrail, as well as the actions of the driver . View: Oregon state trooper Robert Routt stands above ravine where the bus careened off the mountain highway and plunged down the snow-covered slope . The Oregonian quoted one survivor, 25-year-old Yoo Byung Woo, as saying he and some other passengers thought the driver was 'going too fast.' 'I worried about the bus,' Yoo said, adding it was snowing and foggy at the time. He said one rider was frightened and asked if they could take another route. Yoo said rocks smashed through windows after the bus crashed through the guard rail and rolled down. The NTSB said the bus rolled at least once. Other passengers were from British Columbia, and some from Washington state. Investigators say there also may have . been a Japanese passenger and one from Taiwan, and they're working with . consular officials from those nations to identify them. The . survivors, who range in age from 7 to 74, were sent to 10 hospitals in . Oregon, Washington and Idaho. At least 10 were released Monday, police . said. Remains: A twisted guard rail and debris line the road side where the tour bus careened off the mountain highway . Some survivors were carried on backboards by six or eight rescuers. Others were hoisted in baskets, and an all-terrain vehicle arrived toward the end of the operation, Woodson said. Officials said 39 people were taken to hospitals, and 10 of them had been treated and released. The National Transportation Safety Board said two investigators were expected to arrive at the crash site Monday. They will look into why the bus left the road, the condition of the road at the time, the condition of the guardrail, the actions of the driver, and the operations of the company that owns the bus, the agency said. The bus, owned by a British Columbia . company, was returning to Canada from Las Vegas, one of the stops on a . nine-day western tour, when it crashed Sunday just east of Pendleton. Meanwhile, authorities said on Monday that it may be a month or more before investigators and prosecutors decide whether to file charges in the crash. Destination: Oregon police say the tour bus was heading to Vancouver from Las Vegas when it lost control on the slippery interstate . At a news conference Monday, State Police Lt Gregg Hastings said investigators don't know how fast the bus was going, but there were icy spots on Interstate 84 through the Blue Mountains. Hastings said the bus hit a concrete barrier, veered across both westbound lanes, went through a guardrail and plunged 200 feet down a bank. Hastings said authorities are working with the South Korean consulate to identify victims. The crash occurred near a spot on the interstate called Deadman Pass, at the top of a steep, seven-mile descent from the Blue Mountains. That section of road is so notorious that state transportation officials published a warning for truck drivers saying it has 'some of the most changeable and severe weather conditions in the Northwest.' Still, Oregon Department of Transportation spokesman Tom Strandberg said that while there were icy spots where the crash occurred, it was nothing unusual for this time of year. Escape: Survivors were pulled up to the roadside by ropes before at least 26 of them transferred to a local hospital . Crash scene: Police say the bus lost control along snow and ice-covered lanes on Interstate 84 nearly Pendleton causing it to crash through a guardrail in eastern Oregon around 10.30am this morning . He said a sanding truck had applied sand a few hours earlier and was behind the bus making another run when the crash occurred. The sand truck driver was among the first at the scene. The highway has been shut down several times this winter, mostly due to crashed trucks blocking the roadway, Strandberg said. A decision to close the road or require chains is made by the local maintenance crew, he said. Umatilla County Emergency Manager Jack Remillard said the bus was owned by Mi Joo travel in Vancouver, B.C. A bus safety website run by the U.S. Department of Transportation said Mi Joo Tour & Travel has six . buses, none of which have been involved in any accidents in at least the . past two years. First responders: Rescue personnel respond to the scene on I-84, east of Pendleton, where rope was used to help bring up survivors . A spokesman for the NTSB, Peter . Knudson, said seatbelts aren't required on such buses. 'We have been . concerned about this for some time,' Knudson said. I-84 is a major east-west highway through Oregon that follows the Columbia River Gorge. Umatilla County Emergency Manager Jack Remillard said the bus was owned by Mi Joo travel in Vancouver, B.C. A woman who answered the phone at a listing for the company confirmed with The Associated Press that it owned the bus and said it was on a tour of the Western U.S. She declined to give her name.

Vodafone and BT will be among seven bidders competing in next year's 4G auction in what marks the largest ever sale of mobile airwaves in the UK, it has been announced. The firms are vying for a slice of airwaves to launch superfast 4G networks up to seven times faster than current 3G versions. Ofcom said the auction, which kicks off in January, will herald 'better, faster and more reliable mobile broadband connections' for consumers across the UK. The seven firms are bidding to join EE in offering a superfast 4G mobile phone network in the UK . Regulator Ofcom confirmed that O2 . parent Telefonica, Hutchison 3G and Everything Everywhere (EE) are also . on the list, as well as Hong Kong conglomerate PCCW and UK network . supplier MLL Telecom. Ed Richards, chief executive of Ofcom, said: 'The 4G auction will be a competitive process that will dictate the shape of the UK mobile phone market for the next decade and beyond.' While all the UK's major mobile operators are bidding, international player PCCW and MLL are also competing to secure a slice of 4G in Britain. PCCW owns Hong Kong Telecom, while MLL is a private-equity backed firm based in Buckinghamshire that supports fixed and wireless services in the UK. Bidders will be competing to buy airwaves in two separate bands - higher frequency 2.6 GHz and lower frequency 800 MHz - with around 28 lots of spectrum up for grabs in total. EE, which was formed from the merger of Orange and T-Mobile, already has access to 4G and was the first to offer a 4G network in the UK, but is bidding to secure more airwaves in the sale. BT has previously expressed interest in acquiring 2.6GHz frequencies to bolster its wi-fi offering, although it is not thought to have aspirations of becoming a major mobile player. It is hoped the 4G sale will generate a windfall for the Government, following successful auctions in other countries. Mobile operators in the Netherlands paid a total 3.8 billion euro (£3.1 billion) for the country's 4G spectrum last Friday, easily surpassing expectations of around 450 million euro (£366 million). In Ireland last month, operators overcame a challenging economy to generate 854 million euro (£700 million). Applications: The 'starting gun' on the next generation of mobile phone signals has been fired . Ofcom has placed a reserve price of £1.3 billion on the 4G sale, but the Government's tax and spending watchdog this month estimated a £3.5 billion boost to the public finances. The regulator wants at least four mobile wholesalers in the UK to drive competition in the market and said the auction had been designed to achieve this. The watchdog said 4G services should make it much quicker to surf the web on mobiles, giving speeds close to home broadband services and allowing consumers to stream high-quality video, watching live TV and downloading large files. For the typical user, download speeds of initial 4G networks will be at least five to seven times faster than those for existing 3G networks. This means a music album that takes 20 minutes to download on a 3G phone will take just over three minutes on 4G.","4G auction is biggest ever sale of mobile airwaves in Britain .

A killer elephant is being hunted by Nepalese soldiers today after it strayed into villages and killed four people in three months. The rogue wild elephant walked into a thatched house in Gardi village adjoining Chitwan National Park, 50 miles south of Kathmandu, pulled a couple in their 60s from their bed and trampled them to death, said Shiva Ram Gelal, assistant district administrator from Bharatpur, the nearest city. Nepal has about 300 elephants, including around 100 domesticated adults which take tourists on jungle rides in the country's many safari resorts. Dangerous: The elephant was said to have dragged the couple from their bed using its trunk . Most are found on the sub-equatorial plains of the southern Terai, where contact with humans is a regular problem. The same animal killed two other villagers within the last three months, park officials said. 'We have given orders to the army to shoot the elephant that has gone mad,' Gelal told Reuters. 'Soldiers are now searching for it.' Nepal has about 300 elephants, including more than 100 domesticated ones which are used by hotels and national parks to take tourists on jungle rides to watch wild animals like one-horned Asian rhinoceroses and Bengal tigers. Elephants are protected by law and anyone convicted of killing one faces up to 15 years in jail, but Gelal said the Local Administration Act - a Nepali law - allowed authorities to kill the animal if it was responsible for the loss of human life. Recent elephant poaching incidents have led an WWF expert to warn that the species could face localised extinctions if it continues.

A retired head-teacher has hit out at an animal rescue charity after they refused to let him adopt a dog because he was ‘too old’. Don Evans had expressed his wish to take care of an abandoned lurcher earlier this month, but was shocked when Animal Lifeline charity in Longton, Stoke-on-Trent, rejected him. The charity claimed the 71-year-old MBE would not be able to offer a pet ‘at least ten years of active life’ due to his age. 'Disgusted': Don Evans was shocked when he was refused a dog by a local animal rescue charity and instead travelled to Wales to pick up 12-week-old puppy Bo . Yesterday Mr Evans, who was awarded the MBE for his services to the community, said he was not surprised the charity is unable to home their dogs, branding them ‘extremely rude’. He said: I am disgusted by the way I was dealt with. They had the audacity to question my age. ‘I want to give a dog a good home and it's extremely rude to take that approach.' Perfect breed: Mr Evans had expressed his wish to adopt a lurcher but his wish was denied . He added that a lurcher is exactly the breed he has been looking for, perfectly suited for his home which has a private garden and is located near fields. Furious with his local animal charity, Mr Evans travelled to Wales where he picked up lurcher puppy Bo, but says he has complained bitterly to Animal Lifeline since. 'It's not surprising that they don't have homes for all of their dogs.’ Mr Evans, who lives in Longton, had . offered to take in one of six lurchers which were dumped in a car in . Leek, Staffordshire earlier this year. He . called the charity and explained that he had plenty of time to care for . the dog since had had retired as a head teacher and school governor. But . staff insisted Don did not fit their criteria and have since insisted . they pride themselves on ‘giving a dog a home for life’. Nick Fletcher, a spokesman for Animal Lifeline, yesterday defended the charity’s decision. He said: ‘We have the bulk of our dogs . from people whose circumstances have changed, died, relocated or, more . commonly, they have had to move to rented accommodation which doesn't . allow pets. ‘The reason we do get . complaints is because people don't understand how we work and some . people do get a little resentful to be told the type of dog they should . have.’ Discriminated: The retired head teacher, holding a leaflet from Animal Lifeline, has complained to the charity over the refusal, calling their response to his adoption request 'extremely rude' Refusal: The Animal Lifeline charity claimed Mr Evans would be unable to provide an active lifestyle for a lurcher dog . Pat Lawton, one of the charity's trustees, added: ‘Lurchers are very beautiful family dogs, but they are escape artists that are attracted to wildlife. ‘I tried to explain to Don that we have many wonderful dogs for him. However lurchers want at least ten years of active live. ‘The reason we didn't go ahead was because we pride ourselves on giving a dog a home for life. ‘The dog is chosen to suit the owner.

It was the night that mini burgers and fruitcake were served up at Buckingham Palace and Cheryl Cole made a beeline for her ‘dream date’ Prince Harry. That ‘barmy’ Grace Jones clung to Prince William’s side like a strip of Velcro – leaving the future king shaken and very stirred – and there was only one question on the lips of the royal party: how on earth do you address Black Eyed Pea’s Will.i.am? Admittedly, it wasn’t the most raucous after-show party – by rock and roll standards at least – but where else in the world would you get pop royalty sharing a glass of elderflower cordial (yes, really) with the real thing? The morning after the night before: Prince Harry, Kate and William looked a little bleary eyed at the Jubilee Thanksgiving service . Monday night’s post Diamond Jubilee Concert reception was thrown by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, along with Prince Harry, in the Bow Room and Long Gallery. The heavily gilded Bow Room is familiar to the many thousands of guests to Royal Garden Parties who pass through it on their way to the garden. It was originally intended as a part of George IV's private apartments - to be the King's Library - but it was never fitted up as such. Instead, it has become a room for . entertaining and is where The Queen holds the arrival lunch for a . visiting Head of State at the start of a State visit. Star line-up: Black Eyed Pea’s Will.i.am, Grace Jones and Cheryl Cole attended the after-party . It leads off the Long Gallery, a blood-red hallway stretching the width of the palace which is the first sight many get of the interior of the Queen’s official residence. Although the event was ostensibly for the younger royals – led by William Kate and Harry along with their cousins, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie – some of the ‘oldies’ also popped in, including the Duke of York and Prince Edward and his wife, the Countess of Wessex. According to several of those present, the party was very much ‘in the palace mould’ – no seating or music and relatively formal. ‘But given the huge range of celebrities who were there and the fact that they could let their hair down without having to worry about a photographer jumping out from the nearest antique, the atmosphere was really lively and relaxed,’ said one. Will.I.Am Tweets a picture with Prince William at the Jubilee party . Butlers dressed red and black livery . served champagne ‘like it was water’ as well as soft drinks including . elderflower cordial for those who chose not to partake. Canapés including fish cakes, smoked . salmon blinis, mini hamburgers and small bowls of pasta and risotto, . made by the Buckingham Palace kitchen under head chef Mark Flanagan, . were also handed round, also including, oddly, tiny slivers of fruit . cake. Every star who performed at the . concert was present including four knights – Sir Tom Jones, Sir Cliff . Richard, Sir Paul McCartney (accompanied by his daughters Mary and . Stella) and Sir Elton John – as well as Dame Shirley Bassey. Hearthrobs . JLS rubbed shoulders with classical pianist Lang Lang while The Voice . judge Will.i.am (who is apparently tiny in real life) apparently made it . his mission to meet as many members of British royalty as he could. The . singer Tweeted obsessively throughout the night – even posting a . picture of himself and Prince William, who was clutching a glass of . champagne, at the party with the message: ‘Just realized I am the . shorter Will.i.am.’ He also posted several pictures of himself posing with guardsmen at the palace gates accompanied by the message #iambritish. ‘No-one . actually knew what to call him, though, it was hilarious. Did you . address him as Will.i.am, William or Mr .i.am?’ joked one guest. Prince . William was also a focus of attention for eccentric signer Grace Jones, . who had earlier performed her entire song, Slave To The Rhythm, . circling a hula-hoop around her waist. A . source said : ‘She just wouldn’t leave his side and kept introducing . him to all the celebs, saying ‘have you met Prince William? Have you met . William?’ It was getting a bit embarrassing and the prince actually . looked rather uncomfortable.’ Other . guests, however, described Miss Jones, who was accompanied by her . elderly mother, as ‘fantastic’. ‘She was still wearing her hat and . towered over everyone in the room. She was hugely eccentric and hugely . entertaining. Just fantastic,’ said one. Singletons Cheryl Cole and Prince Harry . were also believed to have chatted at length – an interesting pairing as . Harry recently admitted he ‘fancied’ the Girls Aloud star while Cheryl . told an interviewer:  'I love Prince Harry. Actually, I had a dream last . night I married Prince Harry and was a real-life princess. It's true. And Charles was my father-in-law.’ According to guests singer Stevie Wonder was 'the life and soul of the party' Aides discreetly declined to reveal how long they chatted for, however. The star of the night was, however, singer Stevie Wonder, who was ‘the life and soul of the party’. ‘Everyone wanted to meet him and he wanted to meet everyone!’ said a fellow guest. He was also (as was the ever-present Will.i.am) particularly excited about meeting the Queen earlier – indeed according to the concert organiser, Take That’s Gary Barlow, most of the US stars virtually had it written into their performance contracts that they would get to meet the monarch. Sources said that Kate left the festivities a little earlier than the rest of the royals, who were still partying hard at 1.30am. The party finally wrapped up well into the early hours – which may account for the bags some of the young royals had under their eyes at St Paul’s a few hours later. ‘It was a great night – I think because of where they were, all the stars were very relaxed. It was a fabulous end to a remarkable night,’ said one equally baggy-eyed reveller.","Young royals host post Diamond Jubilee Concert celebration at the palace .

Train travellers have reacted angrily as they face fare rises of up to 10 per cent from this week - but rather than having sympathy for them, the transport minister has claimed the increase is ‘only right’. Norman Baker countered the damning evidence from pressure groups of overcrowding and poor punctuality by insisting the Government is carrying out its biggest rail investment in two centuries. The 55-year-old Liberal Democrat added that ministers are ‘determined to reduce the cost of running the railways’ in the longer term so ‘we can end the era of above-inflation fare rises’. Price increase: Train travellers face fare rises of up to 10 per cent from this week . Mr Baker said: ‘Family budgets are . being squeezed, so that is why this coalition Government has taken . proactive steps to cut the planned fare rises from 3 to 1 per cent above . inflation until 2014. ‘This decision puts an average of £45 . per year back into the pockets of over a quarter of a million annual . season ticket-holders. ‘Many more holders of weekly and . monthly season tickets could also see lower fares and some commuters . could be over £100 better off.’ Research by The Times found season tickets on some rail services have gone up by 40 per cent since the start of the recession. And car park charges are rising by 25 per cent year-on-year. The Railfuture campaign group says . season tickets will increase by an average of 4.2 per cent on Wednesday, . the tenth above-inflation increase in a row. Defence: Transport minister Norman Baker said the Government is carrying out its most rail investment since the 19th century and that it is 'only right' that the public should help fund this . The Association of Train Operating . Companies (ATOC) says the overall average rise, including non-season . tickets, will be 3.9 per cent, but with some non-season-ticket fares . allowed to be increased by an unlimited amount, Railfuture said tickets . could go up by 10 per cent. Analysis by campaigners suggested that average train fares have soared by . more than 26 per cent since the start of the recession – a lower figure than reported by the Times, although it is still suggesting a rate almost three . times faster than wages. Some . commuters are paying £5,000 a year just to get to work - and many will now be paying £1,000 extra than in 2008. The Campaign for Better Transport says . the UK has the highest train fares in Europe, with some UK tickets . almost ten times the price of equivalent fares on the Continent. Rail bosses have been accused of . ‘spinning’ the full extent of the rises and ‘burying bad news’ by . insisting the average increase would be 3.9 per cent. Expensive: Average train fares have soared by more than 26 per cent since the start of the recession - almost three times faster than wages . So-called ‘unregulated fares’, which . include some off-peak trips, can be raised to any figure train companies . choose. Many of these will far exceed the 3.9 per cent ‘average’ rise – . with some soaring nearly 10 per cent. Railfuture spokesman Bruce Williamson said: ‘Yet again, rail fares go up with no perceptible improvement in service. ‘Over the last ten years, fares have increased by more than 50 per cent – much more than people’s incomes. ‘Meanwhile, petrol tax is frozen and . overall the cost of driving remains static. How does this help persuade . people out of their cars and ease congestion? Where is the green . policy?’ Train passengers have endured . widespread disruption, cancellations and delays over Christmas and New . Year – as well as pleas by rail bosses not to travel unless absolutely . necessary – caused by a combination of flooding, weather and engineering . works.

This year regulated fares, which . include season tickets, can be increased by the retail price index . (RPI) inflation rate in July plus one percentage point. This gives the . average figure of 4.2 per cent. Mr Williamson said: ‘Annual increases . should be limited to no more than the rate of inflation, and that should . be the consumer price index (CPI) not RPI, because that’s the lower . figure and pensions benefits and salaries are all linked to CPI.’ From Wednesday, fares are also going up by an average of 4.2 per cent on the London Underground and buses. Mayor Boris Johnson said: ‘Investment . on the transport network will help us to provide faster, more frequent . and reliable journeys for Londoners and is crucial to economic . development and growth.’","Fares up by a whopping 40% over past five years since recession started .

A driver who caused a motorway smash which killed a pensioner has been banned from the roads after he said he had been distracted by a wasp. Richard Knight, 28, told a court his 'phobia' of the insects caused him to swerve across a lane at 70mph on the M3 because he 'didn't want to be stung'. But magistrates rejected his excuse and handed him an 18-month driving ban. Anne Bater, 68, died after the crash on the M3 in Basingstoke in may this year . His VW Golf hit a Honda Jazz which careered off the motorway in Basingstoke, Hampshire, and landed on its roof killing 68-year-old Anne Bater. Her husband Keith, who was a passenger, survived with a back injury but told Basingstoke Magistrates' Court he has been left 'bereft' by the loss of his wife. Knight, from Aldershot, said he was in the outside lane of the motorway when he noticed a . wasp flying near his right ear. He said he wound the driver's window down, but it remained in the car and distracted him. Knight said as he tried to put the passenger side window down he veered into the middle lane, hitting Mrs Bater's car. The court heard that psychiatric tests later revealed Knight had a phobia of winged insects that can sting. Asked how he felt when he saw the wasp in his car, he told magistrates: 'I was very anxious and worried. 'I obviously did not want to be stung, and my instinct was just to get it out of the car.' Richard Knight was given an 18-month driving ban at Basingstoke Magistrates Court after pleading guilty to causing death by careless driving . James Burnham, prosecuting, said Knight's 'special reason' application to avoid a driving ban should be ignored. Mr Burnham said Knight should have safely pulled over to the hard shoulder to let the wasp out. He also read out victim impact statements from Mrs Bater's husband and their two daughters, who were all in court. Mr Bater said in his statement: 'I . never knew the true meaning of the word bereft but that's how I feel . now. Our house is empty and I'm very lonely.' Mrs Bater, from High Wycombe, Bucks, was pronounced dead at Basingstoke and North Hampshire Hospital after the crash in May this year. Matthew Kerruish-Jones, defending, said Knight - who pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving - had shown genuine remorse about the crash. Knight's 'special reason' application was rejected by residing magistrate Roy Cleave, who said he could have taken other actions to avoid the accident. Mr Cleave handed Knight an 18-month driving ban and gave him an 18-month community order with 200 hours unpaid work. He was also ordered to pay £85 in costs.","Richard Knight, 28, swerved his car because he 'didn't want to get stung'

Silvio Berlusconi has been ordered to pay his second wife £82,000 a day as part of their divorce settlement. Veronica Lario was awarded almost £30million a year by a court after a three-year legal tussle. The former actress had wanted the £60million family villa and nearly £250,000 a month in maintenance, but settled for £2.5million a month. Mr Berlusconi, 76, whose personal fortune is estimated at £3.7billion, keeps the villa near Milan as well as control of his business empire. The judgment said the settlement would allow Miss Lario, 56, who has three  children with the former Italian premier, to ‘live in the manner that she was accustomed to during her marriage’. Veronica Lario (left) has won a divorce settlement from Silvio Berlusconi (right) worth £2.5 million . The couple married in 1990 and have three children together . The couple married in 1990 but first . met ten years earlier when Mr Berlusconi saw Miss Lario appear topless . in a play called the Magnificent Cuckold. She filed for divorce in 2009 after . her husband attended an underwear model’s 18th birthday party. Miss . Lario said he had never turned up to any of his own children’s 18th . birthday parties. Mr Berlusconi, who is currently on . trial accused of having underage sex with a prostitute, is now engaged . to marry a 27-year-old TV presenter. The couple met in a dressing room in . 1980 after Berlusconi saw Lario perform in a Milan theater. They later married . in 1990. Berlusconi, 76, has kept sole possession of the €78m Villa Macherio, just outside Milan, which Lario, 56, claimed for herself after living there for more than 20 years. The settlement was filed at Christmas time to give the ex-couple greater privacy, and according to reports Berlosconi's business interests remain untouched by the agreement. It was Berlusconi's second marriage and the couple has three children - Barbara, 28, Eleonora, 26, and Luigi, 24. Lario filed for divorce in 2009 as rumours of Berlusconi's bunga-bunga party nights at his other Milan villa of Arcore were starting to spread. Lario played a major role in triggering Italy's prurient interest in her husband's lavish lifestyle and womanising. New Models: Former girlfriend Nicole Minetti (left) has said Berlusconi's new fiancee Francesca Pascale will make an 'excellent first lady' In 2007, the usually secretive Lario wrote an open letter to Italian newspaper La Repubblica - whose editorial line strongly opposed Berlusconi - demanding public apologies from her husband after he courted a future minister in his government, Mara Carfagna, on national television. Berlusconi complied with Lario's demand and apologised. However, two years later Lario went public again over Berlusconi's marital failings. She described as 'indecent junk' the reported European Parliament candidacy of a number of showgirls for Berlusconi's party. She also hit out at her husband for showing up at the 18th birthday party of Noemi Letizia, which led to widespread speculation about his relationship with the girl. Berlusconi has now announced that he intends to run for Prime Minister again in Italy's forthcoming election. If he succeeds it will be his fourth time in office. The media mogul has also confirmed that he is engaged to 27-year-old Francesca Pascale who sources say is now being groomed for the role of being Italy's 'first lady.' Miss Pascale, the daughter of a wedding photographer who grew up in Naples, began dancing for a kitsch show on Telecapri station when she was 14. She later left show-business, studied political science and became a provincial councillor for Mr Berlusconi’s centre-Right PdL party, but stepped down in July. Earlier this month the billionaire media mogul confirmed their relationship on television, calling her 'beautiful on the inside and the outside'. 'Finally I feel less lonely,' Mr Berlusconi said. 'I am engaged to a Neapolitan, it’s official.' Miss Pascale is said to be friends with Mr Berlusconi’s daughter, Marina, who is chairman of Italy’s largest magazine publisher, Mondadori. Miss Pascale met Mr Berlusconi in 2004 when she was 19. Yesterday, Nicole Minetti, an ex-showgirl and former girlfriend of Berlusconi, said she believes Miss Pascale would make an 'excellent first lady'. Ms Minetti has been a member of Lombardy’s regional assembly since catching Mr Berlusconi’s eye while he was prime minister. She was accused of procuring dancers and escorts for lavish “bunga bunga” parties, charges which she denies. Milan prosecutors are also investigating whether she improperly requested state reimbursements for €27,000 (£22,000) in spa treatments, hotels and dinners. Ms Minetti added that she thought Miss Pascale is 'absolutely the right person to stand by Mr Berlusconi right now.'","Former premier's taste for younger women takes it toll on the Billionaire playboy .

But without that chance viewing on a rare day off, the 54-year-old may not have made it to his 50th birthday. Despite being at a high risk of contracting prostate cancer, Mr Kissi was totally unaware his life was in danger until he watched BBC's City Hospital. Coming from black African decent and having a family history of prostate cancer put him more at risk. Phil Kissi with his niece and nephews, clockwork from top right Mildred, 8, TJ, 2, Bradley, 6, David, 2 and Marlon, 4. After discovering he had an aggressive form of the cancer, Mr Kissi, from the Isle of Dogs in London, underwent robotic surgery at Guy’s and St.Thomas’ Hospital and has now completed his treatment. 'I was very, very, lucky,' he says. 'If I hadn't have gone to get checked I wouldn't be here today and seen my three grandchildren. 'When you've been given a second chance at life you have to be thankful every day for it.' Coming so close to death gave Mr Kissi the impetus he needed to turn his life around and dedicate his time to raising awareness about the disease, as well as pursuing his personal goals to help young people and train athletes.

A British woman has become one of the first to benefit from pioneering surgery that uses tissue taken from a cow’s heart to rebuild the liver. The operation brings the possibility of whole donor organs being taken from animals – known as xenotransplantation – ever closer. Michelle Morgan-Grainger, 42, from Liverpool, was diagnosed with a rare form of liver cancer in October 2010. Doctors initially told her she could not be cured. But two months later, she underwent a procedure to remove the tumour in her liver along with a large portion of her Inferior Vena Cava (IVC). This major blood vessel is positioned close to the back of the liver and returns blood from the lower half of the body back to the heart. The IVC was then reconstructed with a patch made from the outer lining of a cow’s heart, a material called bovine pericardium. ‘ART FORM’ SURGERY . The procedure is likened to an art form by Hassan Malik, consultant hepatobiliary surgeon at Aintree University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Liverpool. ‘This was a long and complex procedure and is offered only in a handful of places around the world,’ he says of the operation, called a right hepatic trisectionectomy with enblock resection of the IVC. ‘There are only five centres in Europe with experience in such cases. To date about 150 patients have been treated worldwide. The bovine patch has been used in heart surgery for a while but employed in just six liver surgery cases, four of which we’ve performed.’ According to Mr Malik, what makes Michelle’s operation so specialist is the use of this bovine material, as well as the fact so much of the IVC was removed. ‘Usually, if the IVC needs reconstruction, a plastic-type synthetic material rather than the natural bovine material has been used,’ he says. However, this carries a higher risk of infection and also of blood clots forming after surgery. ‘With the bovine material, the risks are dramatically reduced,’ he says. ‘Patients avoid the need for long-term use of drugs to thin the blood, which have side effects. The bovine material is pre-treated and has gone through chemical processes to remove the risk of infection, which means it is as close as you can get to the IVC, without taking part of another human vein.’ WHY USE A COW GRAFT? ‘The . material is a similar thickness, it’s flexible and easy to cut to shape . and suture in place,’ says Mr Malik. ‘Synthetic materials tend to be . more rigid. And if the synthetic material becomes infected, it will need . replacing. ‘The bovine . material becomes a part of the patient and will last as long as they do. The choice of synthetic or bovine material comes down to an assessment . made by the surgeon. We find it seems to work without any problems.’ Each . year in the UK, 3,400 people are diagnosed with primary liver cancer, . when a tumour originates in the liver. The outlook is often poor. Pioneering work: How the liver and the blood vessel was removed and the tissue from the cow's heart put in its place to form a new blood vessel . Liver cancer usually presents with few symptoms and most cases are detected once the cancer is advanced. There are different types of primary liver cancer but possible symptoms can include jaundice – this causes the skin and whites of the eyes to go yellow – discomfort in the stomach, weight loss, and loss of appetite. Suitability for surgery depends on various factors, including the size and position of a tumour and whether the liver is damaged by cirrhosis (scarring). But for some, it can offer the chance of a cure. PAIN IN THE SIDE WAS CANCER . Michelle visited her GP after experiencing a pain in her side, similar to muscle strain, for a couple of weeks. Doctors thought she may have gallstones, but the pain persisted and later scans revealed the worst. Indeed, by the time Michelle’s cancer was diagnosed, her tumour was 6in in size – though fortunately it hadn’t spread elsewhere in her body – and she was told by doctors that it was inoperable. But after her case was referred to the specialist liver surgery centre at Aintree University Hospital, Mr Malik, along with surgeon Mr Stephen Fenwick, offered her a surgical solution. Mr Malik says: ‘As we had experience of this kind of surgery, we thought we could help her. As it turns out, her operation was life-changing.’ Cattle aid: The tissue from the cow is of similar thickness as the original blood vessel and is more flexible than synthetic materials . A TEN-HOUR OPERATION . Michelle, who is married and works as a health director for BT, says: ‘The surgeons told me about the procedure and explained they could give it a try, but they didn’t know if it would work. It was my decision, and I wanted to try something rather than do nothing.’ During the ten-hour operation, performed under general anaesthetic, Mr Malik and Mr Fenwick removed 80 per cent of Michelle’s liver. As the tumour was wrapped around the tubular IVC, three-quarters of the vein had to be removed. ‘The liver is the only organ in the body with the ability to regenerate,’ says Mr Malik. ‘Over three months, the piece of remaining liver regrows to its original size. But you have to try to recreate the structure of the IVC. Imagine a can of drink: if you cut a hole in the side, three-quarters of the way around the can, then one side is intact and the rest is open. You have to try to close that gap and this bovine material acts as a wall.’ Eleven days after surgery, Michelle left hospital. Three months later, she was back at work. And less than 18 months on, she is cancer-free. ‘I made a joke about mooing when I found out about the bovine material,’ says Michelle. ‘But I’m thankful it was used. I know I’m very lucky. I have scans and blood tests quarterly, so I live each three months at a time. ‘I recently raised £42,000 for charity and I want to continue to fundraise to increase awareness of liver cancer and also to raise awareness of my surgeons and the hospital, because if it wasn’t for them, I wouldn’t be here.’ aintreehospitals.nhs.uk .","Michelle Morgan-Grainger, 42, had been told her liver cancer was incurable .

"By . Gerri Peev . PUBLISHED: . 19:01 EST, 1 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:49 EST, 2 January 2013 . Welfare handouts to those languishing on the dole have risen almost twice as fast as average wages over the past five years. Out-of-work benefits have jumped in value by an astonishing 20 per cent since 2007 while wages have crept up by just 12 per cent, official figures released last night reveal. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the figures proved that automatically increasing benefits by the rate of inflation, as has previously been the case, was ‘not fair’ on working people whose taxes fund  the handouts. No work pays off: Jobseeker's Allowance has risen by 20 per cent, from £59.15 a week in 2007 to £71 . Ministers are now battling to reform the system and impose a 1 per cent cap on out-of-work benefit increases for the next three years, but face opposition from Labour. Mr Duncan Smith said yesterday: ‘Working people across the country have been tightening their belts after years of pay restraint while at the same time watching benefits increase. That is not fair. ‘The welfare state under Labour effectively trapped thousands of families into dependency as it made no sense to give up the certainty of a benefit payment in order to go back to work.’ The disparity between those in work and those on welfare is laid bare by the figures from the Department for Work and Pensions. While working families have faced a . greater squeeze on their income from inflation, benefit claimants have . been cushioned from the soaring cost of  living by automatic . inflation-linked rises in their payments. 'Not fair': Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the new 1 per cent cap on jobseekers' handout increases was necessary to make the system fair towards taxpayers . Over the past five years, Jobseeker’s Allowance rose by 20 per cent from £59.15 a week in 2007/08 to £71 in 2012/13. Last year alone, out-of-work benefits rose by 5.2 per cent, while average earnings increased by 1.7 per cent – just one-third the rate. Meanwhile, across the whole economy, weekly earnings went up from £392 in 2007 to £441 in 2012. Ministers argue that the figures underline their case that Labour’s welfare system provided a disincentive to claimants to take a job. A new Universal Credit scheme, to be introduced in stages from April, will replace most existing out-of-work  benefits and is designed to ensure that it always pays to work. Unifying taxes and benefits into one system, it will also prevent total benefits from exceeding the average wage. The new figures will also strengthen the case for the Government’s decision to cap benefit increases to 1 per cent. Unfair increase: Whilst state handouts for jobless have risen by 20 per cent, wages are only up by 12 per cent since 2007 . Chancellor George Osborne faced criticism from Labour and the unions for the decision, announced in his Autumn Statement last month. Labour has vowed to vote against the 1 per cent rise when the measure is debated in Parliament early this year. But ministers insist it would be unaffordable to allow benefits to continue to outstrip wages, as well as unfair. Private sector pay has stagnated during the recession, while the public sector has been subject to a three-year pay freeze. Labour argues that the new benefits cap will hit millions of working families on low incomes whose tax credits will also be capped. The party’s work and pensions spokesman, Liam Byrne, said the move would mean some part-time workers would be better off on benefits. Mr Duncan Smith said the new Universal Credit system would ensure fairness, adding: ‘This Government is restoring fairness to the system and Universal Credit will ensure it always pays to be in work.’ Mr Osborne is determined to shave a further £10billion from the welfare bill, on top of an £18billion reduction in benefits already in place, after a more downbeat than expected economic forecast. The cost of increasing benefits in line with inflation since the 2008 recession has been £6.3billion. In 2009 alone, the Labour government raised means-tested benefits – not pensions – by 6.3 per cent. Overall, more than £90billion is spent on working age welfare every year, the same as the entire education budget.","Jobseeker's Allowance up 20 per cent from £59.15 a week in 2007/08 to £71 .

Brave driver John Harbour revved up the rusty engine and soared high above the West Sussex track in an extraordinary display of determination and skill. The jaw-dropping stunt earned the 31-year-old mechanic the title of 2012's car jumping champion. Scroll down for video . Don't look now, Mum! Brave mechanic John Harbour won the competition with this remarkable jump . Drive of their lives: Many of the competitors are stunt drivers, or simply in it for the action . Amazing feat: The winning car lands unscathed after effortlessly clearing nine cars . High hopes: Mechanic John Harbour dismissed him winning jump as a piece of luck . He laughed off the victory afterwards, insisting that his methods were simple. 'You just head for the ramp and hope for the best,' said Mr Harbour, from Crawley. 'Hope you land on the other side.' Race organiser Jim Hazelgrove agreed . that winning the terrifying championship at Angmering . was largely about having the grit - or the craziness - to do it. 'The drivers get in their car, aim at . a ramp and then next thing they see is the sky - and they hope they're . going to clear ten cars,' he said. 'It's just a thrill - and you get the lunatics that can't go on the road, that want to race, and just do something really special. 'You've got to be an idiot, to start with, or have no fear, and then it's just luck, because it depends on the pitch of the car, how long you hold the throttle...

'There is a technique, but only the top few drivers know it - the rest have just gone out there to be stuntmen.' The wacky cars are painted in vibrant colours such as pink and acid green to match the drivers' flair and remarkable nerve. Others add patterns such as Union Flags or write slogans on the peeling bodywork of the clapped-out cars. Rear-wheel drive cars are more effective than front-wheel drive, because the back wheels can turn even after the car is halfway off the ramp. A front-wheel drive car will nosedive. Last year's champion, Dean Archer, said: 'It's just a little bit of a buzz. 'Everyone gets a bit nervous at first, but as soon as you're lined up, accelerators flat down to the floor, into second gear hopefully get enough speed and hope it goes all right. It's a bit of fun'.

A quiet Manhattan widow shocked friends by giving a pair of $10 million checks to the New York Public Library and the Central Park Conservancy before she died. Mary McConnell Bailey, who preferred track suits over designer frocks and didn't care much for expensive jewels, left the checks for her two favorite institutions before her death in February of 2011, the New York Post reported. She was 88 years old. The library and the conservancy, a nonprofit that looks after the park, were shocked after receiving the checks for $10 million each. The money was sent by Bailey's estate. Friend and neighbor Lizanne Stoll told the Post that she led a quiet, modest life. 'You never would have known,' Stoll said of Bailey's wealth. 'She was very secretive about it all.' Bailey lived in a two-bedroom apartment on East 57th Street and 1st avenue in New York that has an estimated worth of $760,000 on the real estate website Zillow.com.

Many Brits drink bottled water over tap because they believe it's better for them . It's the one accessory that no health-conscious fitness enthusiast is seen without. And the benefits of bottled water are so valued that it costs up to 1,000 times more than what comes out of our taps. But far from being healthier, the bottled variety is subject to far less stringent safety tests than tap water. It is also much more likely to be contaminated or become a source of infection, according to a university study. The warning suggests that much of the £1.5billion-plus Britons pay for bottled water each year in the belief that it is better for us is spent mistakenly. On average, we drink 33 litres of bottled water annually, whether ordinary mineral, fizzy, or ‘purified’ tap water. Almost a quarter of people who drink bottled water at home say they do so because they believe it is ‘better for them’ than tap water, according to market researchers Mintel. But what these consumers may not realise is that tap water must be checked daily under a rigorous inspection regime. It also contains trace amounts of chlorine that prevent the spread of anything harmful such as bacterial infections. By contrast, makers of bottled water are only required to undertake monthly testing at source. Once filled and sealed, a bottle of water might remain in storage for months before it is sold. Bottled water contains no  disinfecting additives such as chlorine. After a bottle of water is  opened it has no way of remaining sterile, and so must be drunk within days. Professor Paul Younger of Glasgow University said: ‘Water coming from UK taps is the most stringently tested in the world. ‘People think there must be something wrong with tap water because it is so cheap and plentiful. But from a safety and price perspective, tap water is better for you. Bottled water is subject to far less stringent safety tests than tap water and is more likely to become contaminated or become a source of infection . Pricey: More than £1.5billion is spent on bottled water - - 1,000 times more expensive than tap water - in Britain every year . ‘If the bottle is accidentally opened or someone tampers with it, then it can easily get contaminated,’ added Prof Younger, who is the author of Water: All That Matters. ‘There’s certainly a greater chance you could find something harmful in bottled water than from your taps. ‘Ideally it should be drunk on the day it is opened, as it can easily pick up bacteria from someone’s hands or face.’ Batches of bottled water have had to be removed from supermarkets shelves because of questions over contamination. In 1990, Perrier had to withdraw millions of bottles worldwide after traces of benzene were found in the water. And in 2004, Coca-Cola launched Dasani, which was ‘purified’ tap water taken straight from mains supplies. But within weeks hundreds of thousands of bottles were recalled after it emerged the  purification process may have contaminated the water with a possibly carcinogenic substance. Tap water supplies have also been compromised in the past. In 1988, aluminium sulphate was added to the wrong treatment tank, polluting the drinking water in Camelford, Cornwall. Sue Pennison of the Drinking Water Inspectorate, which audits household supplies, said out of more than four million samples of tap water last year, 99.96 per cent passed strict standards. She said: ‘Tap water is safe to drink, everything else is a personal lifestyle choice.’ Jo Jacobius, director of British Bottled Water Producers, said all water available in the UK is ‘highly regulated and generally of good quality’. She added that most bottled water companies test on a daily basis. Natural bottled mineral water must come from an officially recognised underground spring, be bottled at source and cannot be treated or filtered. Spring water must also be bottled at source, but it can be treated or filtered. Sourced from rivers, boreholes and springs, tap water is treated and put into supply or held via storage reservoirs.","Bottled water is more likely to be contaminated or be a source of infection .

Three of the relatives fighting for a share of Huguette Clark's fortune now stand to inherit a further $6.3million each. The siblings' windfall is as a result of the death of Timothy Henry Gray. The reclusive heiress's great-half -nephew, Gray died before he could even be told that he stood to inherit $19million. Gray, 60, died of hypothermia shortly before Christmas. He was homeless and his body was discovered under a railway bridge in Wyoming. As he was not married and had no children the sum, which Public Administrators were fighting to secure for him, will now be divided by his three surviving siblings - Gerald Gray, Celia Gray Cummings and Alice Gray Coelho. Speaking to Mail Online, attorney John Morken who is representing 19 of the 21 potential distributees, described this latest development as 'a very sad part of a very sad story.' Mr Morken, a partner at prestigious New York firm Farrell Fritz who specialises in trust and estate litigation, said that he was hopeful that the family's case would reach a settlement. He revealed: 'There are efforts to settle it going on and that's certainly a possibility. Another possible outcome is a Summary Judgement whereby the issue is deemed so clear that there is no need for a trial.' The family remain prepared to go before a jury should no agreement be reached. Mr Morken and his team have gathered and . scrutinised thousands of documents and taken hours of depositions including ones from . doctors and nurses entrusted with Huguette's care in a discovery process which began in June. Court papers were lodged last . Feburary in the bid to prove that the heiress, who was 104 when she died . two years ago, was not in a fit state to sanction her second Will, written . in April 2005. While all who are fighting were named in her first Will, . the second makes no mention of the family members - some of whom had not seen their reclusive relative for 40 years. It divides her estate between her . nurse, goddaughter, attorney, accountant, hospital, doctor, favourite . museum, various employees and an art foundation that Huguette, herself a . talented artist, wanted established at her oceanfront estate, . Bellosguardo, in Santa Barbara. The family . claim that Huguette, 'was not competent to make a Will in that she did . not know the nature, extent or value of her assets.' Conservative . estimates place the fortune, inherited from her father Montana Senator . William Clark's copper mines, at $307million. Timothy Henry Gray froze to death in the bleak Wyoming winter before he could be told of his possible fortune . They paint a picture of a vulnerable woman, who had retreated mentally and physically from the real world, and was coerced and defrauded by her closest advisors - attorney Wallace Bock, accountant Irving Kamsler - and nurse, Hadassah Peri. Mr Morken described a court-ordered accounting of Huguette's finances as overseen . by Bock and Kamsler in the last 15 years of her life as, 'a chilling . report of mishandling, misappropriation and mismanagement.' Wealth: Huguette (right) is pictured as an 11-year-old with her father and sister Andree in this 1917 photo . Great wealth in the Gilded Age but Huguette's copper mining fortune never brought her happiness . Huguette's is a strange . and sorry tale. During her life she regarded her great . wealth as 'a menace to happiness.' When she died two weeks shy of her 105th birthday the . only people present at her burial were funeral home employees. 'Everything stopped for her when her mother died' She had spent the the final two decades of her life in seclusion in New York's Beth Israel Hospital. She wasn't ill. Ironically it was her fear of illness and dying that saw her effectively give up her life some 20 years before her death. While she lived a solitary life her three fabulous homes sat empty: the $100million Bellosguardo estate, a $24million country house in Conneticut and a $100million co-op, the largest apartment on Fifth Avenue overlooking Central Park. At 42 rooms Huguette's was the largest apartment on Fifth Avenue and overlooked Central Park . Huguette's Connecticut country house worth $24million . Bellosguardo, Santa Barbara, a vast estate that has lain empty since 1963 . According to Andre Baeyens, Huguette's great-half-nephew, a former French Ambassador and one of the relatives embroiled in the legal battle, 'Everything stopped for her when her mother died.' Huguette's mother, Anna, was 39 years younger than Sen Clark who was a widower when they met following the death of his first wife. Most of the relatives fighting for the family fortune are descendants from that first marriage. From the very beginning Huguette's life was touched by intrigue and tragedy. No record was ever found of the marriage between French-born Anna and Sen Clark which supposedly took place in France five years before her birth. Unfazed by public opinion Sen Clark, who paid little attention to ethics and fulfilled his ambition to enter politics by buying votes, set Anna and his daughter up in a Fifth Avenue apartment that cost three times more than the Yankee Stadium. He was as wealthy as Rockefeller, a product of the Gilded Age who made his fortune in copper mines, timber and banks and owned the land that would one day become Las Vegas. Former U.S. Senator William A. Clark, center, joins his daughter, Huguette, at the Easter Parade in New York. Huguette's only sister, Andree died of meningitis age 16 and Huguette grieved her loss to the end. She briefly married a bank clerk, William Gower but the marriage foundered within months and ended in divorce after two years. And so Huguette's retreat from adulthood began. Speaking to NBC last year Msr Baeyer said: 'She didn't want to go out. She didn't want to have beautiful things. She just wanted to be home and play with her dolls.' Huguette collected dolls obsessively - on her mother's death she filled her apartment with them. Huguette occupied the entire eighth floor of the Fifth Avenue building while her mother had an almost equally large apartment on the 12th. She always referred to it as 'mummy's apartment.' The two women were constant companions following the end of Huguette's brief marriage. In stark contrast to her father's greed Huguette was generous to the point of extravagance. During the Great Depression she and her mother tore down their Santa Barbara home and rebuilt it just to give people jobs. She sent dolls to friends as surprises, once buying two first class seats to Paris: one for a doll and one for her personal physician to make sure it arrived safely. She paid $342,000 a year in tax and upkeep on her New York apartment, employed gardeners and groundkeepers and effectively funded a life she herself did not live.","Death of homeless man who didn't even know he was an 'heir' adds an extra $19million to three surviving siblings named in first Will .

A man whose baby son went missing 21 years ago has spoken of the pain he felt as he watched officers search for the youngster's body. Simon Ward, 42, a property developer from the north of England, flew to the Greek island of Kos when police from South Yorkshire started digging there in October, searching for the remains of Ben Needham, who vanished in July 1991 aged just 21 months. He told the Daily Mirror how he dressed in clothes similar to police so he could watch the dig undisturbed as it unfolded, as well as about the painful mix of emotions he endured as he watched what could have been the final resting place of his beloved son. Mystery: Ben Needham (left) was just 21 months old when he vanished in July 1991. His mother Kerry Grist (right) believes he is still alive . Co-operation: Greek and British police worked together to search for Ben, but found no trace of him. He would be around 23 years-old now . He said: 'I was watching every step of the way, every scoop of that digger, and it was weird because I wanted to be there, but at the same time there were heart-stopping moments when I thought they had made some kind of discovery.' When he was not watching the dig he described how he would 'torture' himself by revisiting places in Kos that he had been with Ben. 'I would torture myself going back to places where I had been with him. Really I had just one good week with him in all my time with him on Kos, when we went to the beach,' he said. Investigation: British officers search the ground for any sign of Ben using a mechanical digger. They have now returned to the UK . Painstaking: The latest search focused on a mound of soil and rubble near to where Ben went missing. It was thought the baby may have been covered by rubble during renovation work at the farmhouse . British officers joined their Greek . counterparts and used specialist search dogs and hi-tech imaging equipment. However, they drew a blank following an extensive search. Det . Supt Matt Fenwick, from South Yorkshire Police, led the dig around the . farmhouse in the hamlet of . Iraklis that was being renovated when Ben disappeared 21 years ago. He . said: 'Even after the search we have done you can never say 100 per . cent, but the search has been so extensive and so thorough it is very . unlikely that he could be in the specific locations where we have . searched.” Ben . was being cared for by his grandparents Eddie and Christine Needham . when he vanished from outside the farmhouse. Painstaking: Officers used intricate techniques to search the ground in the area where the youngster went missing . Intensive: British police were granted a permit to carry out the search from the authorities on Kos . One . theory is the toddler was accidentally trapped beneath piles of dirt . and building material which were being dumped on the plot by a JCB . digger working nearby. Detectives . had believed that a small Dinky toy car belonging to Ben could be key . to discovering his fate. They used specialist scanning equipment to . search for signs of buried metal as well as possible human remains. Local . people in and around the village of Iraklise helped with the operation . to find the youngster. Intricate: It was hoped that the search would at least have revealed some clues to Ben's whereabouts - but none was found . At work: Officers used probes - together with more hi-tech equipment - to test the ground in their search for Ben . Authorities on Kos granted a permit for the excavation based on ‘reasonable suspicions’ by British police. The cost of the operation – certain . to be a substantial five figure sum – will be paid by British taxpayers. Despite a number of possible sightings . and a range of theories about what happened to him, no trace of the . youngster has ever been found.","Father of missing Ben Needham watched British and Greek police dig for remains on island of Kos .

A minister yesterday outraged train passengers by insisting that despite overcrowding, disruption and inflationary fare rises they are getting a ‘premium service’. On the day rail travellers were hit with their tenth above-inflation annual fare price rise in as many years, transport minister Norman Baker insisted: ‘We’re not doing too bad.’ Rises have averaged nearly 4 per cent, but Mr Baker said fares were not overly expensive when off-peak tickets – and not just the most costly rush-hour ones – were taken into account. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Fair fares? Passengers arrive at Kings Cross station today as New Year rail fares increases kick in and new research reveals prices have almost doubled in the past decade . Rail minister Norman Baker admitted the fares system is 'not ideal' but insisted tickets were not as expensive as some suggest . He even claimed that punctuality on . Britain’s trains, which was recently shown to be far worse than thought, . ‘was better than in Germany at the moment’. A Transport Department spokesman later . admitted the minister had no figures to substantiate his claim – which . had come from ‘an anecdote he heard at a conference last year’. The controversy erupted as the New . Year return to work got underway with commuters enduring ‘cattle class’ conditions and facing higher fares. Regulated fares, which include season . tickets, are increasing by up to 6.4 per cent for 2013, with an average . rise across all tickets of 3.9 per cent. On some routes, the price of a . season ticket has now risen by more than 70 per cent in a decade. The price rises follow the misery . experienced by millions of passengers over Christmas and New Year. The . period was dominated by delays, disruption, over-running engineering . works and pleas by rail bosses for passengers not to travel ‘unless . absolutely necessary’. Last night passengers and critics said . Mr Baker’s comments were ‘astonishing’ and accused the Lib Dem minister . and the Coalition of being ‘out of touch’. Stephen Joseph, of the Campaign for . Better Transport, said: ‘To suggest passengers are enjoying a premium . service is  astonishing. 'Many commuters are enduring cattle class . conditions on some of these lines and that is anything but a premium . product – even for cattle.’ Bruce Williamson, of the campaign . group Railfuture, said: ‘Enough is enough. They’re out of touch. Fares . have risen with no perceptible improvement in service. 'Our fares are the . highest in Europe. But we don’t have the best rail service in Europe. Most people don’t choose to travel at peak times – they are forced to do . so to get to work on time.’ Mr Baker accepted the above-inflation . rises were ‘not ideal’ and wanted to end them as soon as possible, but . did not put a timescale on it. He added: ‘You could argue people who . are travelling in the rush hour are using the premium product and ought . to pay something which reflects that.’ Passenger protest: Shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle joins TSSA General Secretary, Manuel Cortes and other rail campaigners during a demonstration against fair rises outside St Pancras station in London . He also insisted that ‘given the . stresses and strains we’re not doing too bad’. His praise for the . network is all the more extraordinary because his department has . recently delivered damning statistics on lateness and overcrowding on . trains. Last month First Great Western’s . 7.44am Henley-on-Thames to Paddington service was named as the most . overcrowded in England and Wales, with 80 per cent more passengers than . it was built to carry in comfort. Other figures showed that the . worst-performing train companies are running fewer than half their . services on time. UK passengers pay some of the most . expensive fares in Europe. Based on rush-hour prices for those who do . not pre-book, a British traveller can go an average of 133 miles for . £100, against 188 miles in Norway for the same money, 312 in Spain and . Germany, 365 in Wales and Scotland, 558 in France and 736 in Italy. The policy of annual above-inflation . fare rises is intended to switch more of the burden of paying for the . railways away from the taxpayer and towards the fare-payer. Mr Baker said: ‘We’ve inherited a . policy from the last government – the only difference between us and . them is that we’ve embarked on the biggest investment programme since . the 19th century.’ He accepted that ‘walk-on fares’ – not . booked in advance – can be among the most expensive in Europe. But he . argued: ‘Once you take the basket of fares, include early advance and . off peaks, we are not nearly as expensive as is being presented.’ All rail fares go up by an average of 3.9 per cent today but some will increase by as much as 10 per cent .

But they are now the fastest-selling exotic fruit in Britain. Sales of persimmons overtook kiwi fruit, mangos and avocados in the build up to Christmas, according to industry experts. More than four million of the fruit, which resemble bright orange tomatoes, were sold in British supermarkets in 2012 – double the number sold the previous year. Exotic: Persimmons have now overtaken fruits such as mangos and kiwis in Britain's supermarkets . Experts put the success of persimmons down to their health benefits. They are rich in vitamins A and C, contain calcium, potassium, iron and magnesium and have twice as much fibre per 100g than an apple. And, perhaps most importantly at the start of the new year, research has shown persimmons help lower the density of alcohol in the blood which, along with the sweetness, makes them a great hangover cure. At around 50p each, they are also cheaper than most exotic fruits. Persimmons, which are mainly grown in China and Japan, can be eaten with the skin on without special preparation and can be used in salads, with chicken, lamb or pork, or to make desserts. Dean Hayden, exotic fruit buyer for Asda, said: ‘The market for persimmon is growing at a huge rate. Persimmon is a very accessible fruit. Out of favour: Kiwi fruit has falling down the pecking order in terms of popularity among British shoppers . 'It’s consistently sweet, you can eat it hard like an apple or soft like a peach and importantly you waste nothing, not even the skin, which is edible. ‘Customers get great satisfaction from their purchase and repeat sales tell us it’s a favourite and will continue surprising many more customers to come. ‘Several years ago the produce industry were saying persimmon would be the new kiwi fruit. ‘They were right but it’s taken until now for us to develop; we now have a better understanding and control of the processes required to deliver this great value and versatile fruit that we see today, better late than never.’","Supermarkets sold more than four million of the fruits in 2012 .

Nicole Jones said their ten-year marriage was 'irretrievably broken', according to the divorce complaint filed in a suburban Atlanta court on Monday. The filing does not mention the Christmas morning fight that prompted Nicole Jones to call police and led to Andruw Jones' arrest on a battery charge. Fight: Police say they were called to Andruw Jones' home in a wealthy suburb of Atlanta and found him fighting with his wife of ten years, Nicole Derick Jones, who has not filed for divorce . Nicole Jones' lawyer, John Mayoue, . declined to comment on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear whether . Andruw Jones had a lawyer. Nicole Jones is seeking joint legal and primary custody of the couple's nine-year-old son, the complaint said. She is asking for child support, . alimony and half of the couple's property. She also wants a judge to . declare their prenuptial agreement null and void. The couple fought around 1:30am on . December 25 after Nicole Jones asked her husband to help prepare their . home for Christmas morning, a Gwinnett County police report said. She tried to go upstairs, but her husband grabbed her by the ankle and dragged her down some stairs, the report said. He got on top of her and said: 'I want to kill you,' according to the report. She was able to push him away because he was drunk and then she went to her parents' house, the report said. Police said they found injuries on her neck, which they photographed for evidence. Big league star: Jones played for the Atlanta Braves from 1996 until 2007, where he won ten consecutive Golden Glove awards for his skill as an outfielder. He played last season with the New York Yankees . When officers arrived at the Jones . residence in the Sugarloaf Country Club in Duluth and approached him in a . bedroom, they said he appeared to have passed out in his clothes and . was confused about what had happened. Gwinnett County jail records showed Andruw Jones was freed on bond after his arrest. Jones earlier this month signed a . $3.5 million, one-year contract with the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles of . Japan's Pacific League.

The owner of a cocker spaniel that was stolen by a gang of serial dognappers has said the theft was ‘like losing a child’. Six-year-old Jarvis was taken by thieves who broke into the Hampshire cottage of Melanie Parker. Speaking last night, the 36-year-old said: ‘I’m absolutely devastated that someone could do this. He was like my child. Jarvis cannot be replaced.’ Heartbroken: Melanie Parker said losing Jarvis, who was taken from the kennel, pictured, is like losing a child . Jarvis, left and right, is worth £1,500 and has a distinctive black line above his lip . The dog, who is worth £1,500, was taken in a  break-in late on Sunday night. Thieves used bolt-cutters to break into the kennel. Miss Parker said: ‘I love him like I love all of my nine dogs. They are my babies and it breaks my heart that Jarvis is gone. ‘I’m determined to find him and track down who took him. I just want him back. I can’t stop thinking about what he is going through right now.’ Distraught: Melanie Parker, pictured with pet Alfie, left, said she all her dogs are her 'babies' Black-and-white Jarvis is described as a well-trained working dog with a distinctive black line above his lip and his tail docked. He was one of three cocker spaniels stolen in just 24 hours by the gang, who took 14-month old Maisie and nine-month-old Tia, each worth £600, from another property in Hampshire. Dognappers attempted to take at least two more dogs at the weekend. Speaking at her home near Sutton Scotney, Miss Parker recalled when Jarvis was taken. ‘I saw all the dogs were out of the kennels. Then I saw car lights heading up the driveway.’ The cottage is situated on farmland down a long, muddy driveway. Miss Parker said: ‘It’s unpleasant to think someone must have been watching us and watching the house. They knew where the kennels are – you can’t see them unless you are in our garden.’ She fears that Jarvis will be taken abroad. She said: ‘If they get him out of the country, that’ll be it – we’ll never see him again.’ But the thieves left a vital clue behind – a muddy trainer footprint. Officers were said to be searching for a green 4x4 Subaru Forester seen in the area prior to the thefts. Hampshire police warned owners to secure their dogs as the hunt continued.","Melanie Parker is heartbroken after six-year-old Jarvis was taken .

Myra Hindley's crimes so shocked the nation that they became the benchmark by which other acts of evil were measured. But behind bars the Moors Murderer set about a rigorous course of self-improvement, secret files reveal. She wanted to transform herself from a ‘brassy blonde’ to an ‘intelligent, well- educated woman with middle-class values’. Self-improvement: Moors murderer Myra Hindley turned herself from a 'brassy blonde' to an 'intelligent, well-educated woman' and even earned an Open University degree, pictured right . She took up hobbies including badminton and making tapestries, ‘threw herself with enthusiasm into the choir’ and won a music prize for a love song. Prison papers describe the child killer as an ‘extremely meticulous person ... even obsessive’, with one governor  noting: ‘Her room is always tidy and very clean.' But prison officials continued to regard Hindley suspiciously as an ‘arch- manipulator’ and a ‘scheming woman’ who was ‘cold and calculating’, ‘devoid  of emotion’ and should not be trusted, the files show. With her lover and partner in crime Ian Brady, Hindley was responsible for the murders of five children in the 1960s. They were lured to their deaths, sexually tortured and buried on Saddleworth Moor near Manchester. Evil: Ian Brady who killed five children with Myra Hindley between July 1963 and October 1965 . Hindley died in 2002 aged 60 and her confidential files were supposed to have remained secret for another 50 years. But they have been released early to the national archives owing to the huge interest in her life. Tom Clark, a Sheffield University lecturer, has spent three years studying them. The boxes of typed reports and handwritten notes fill more than 30ft of shelf space and give a unique picture of Hindley as seen through the eyes of fellow prisoners, welfare workers, probation officers, warders and chaplains. Hindley became a practising Roman Catholic and dedicated student, earning an Open University degree in Humanities. ‘Myra Hindley is a young woman of superior intellect and academic ability,’ wrote one observer. And her ability to soak up information was undoubtedly aided by an amazing gift. She has ‘almost total recall of the spoken and written word’, said one assessment. Her tutor recalled how she sat O-level German and once out of the examination room ‘wrote the entire paper out again from memory so that I could go through it and assess her chances’. Hindley was jailed for life in May 1966 for the murders of Lesley Ann Downey, ten, and Edward Evans, 17, plus being accessory to the murder of 12-year-old John Kilbride by Brady. In 1987 Hindley and Brady confessed to murdering Pauline Reade, 16, and Keith Bennett, 12. Despite her criminal notoriety she had a ‘very conscientious’ attitude towards her jobs in jail and was put in charge of the kitchen on E wing at Holloway Prison in North London. Her  view that she was better than her fellow inmates quickly became obvious. ‘Myra is fundamentally a very arrogant woman and considers herself superior to the other members of her wing,’ said a 1968 report. She revelled in her celebrity status and put herself as being among the ‘elite’ lifers. For Christmas dinner in 1969 she and another lifer refused to join the others ‘through feelings of superiority’. And ten years into her sentence it was noted after a routine cell change how she would gather several ‘sycophants who will do all the cleaning, fetching and carrying she has become accustomed to’. However, most of the time she got on well with fellow inmates, despite her reputation. Victims: Pauline Reade, 16, left, was their first victim and John Kilbride was killed in 1963 . Murdered: Lesley Ann Downey, 10, left, and Edward Evans, 17, right . Twelve-year-old Keith Benett was abducted on his way to visit his grandmother in Manchester on 16 June 1964. His body has never been found . ‘Women have confessed their horror on learning they were to join a wing with Myra on it, only to admit later what a pleasant and easy woman she was to get on with.’ One prisoner subjected to an unprovoked attack while serving tea wrote to the governor to  praise Hindley. ‘I owed a special thanks to inmate M Hindley who literally threw herself between the attacker and myself whilst I was being kicked,’ she said. ‘Due to this unselfish assistance she suffered blows and kicks that were meant for me.’ As far back as 1974 the prison governor, who had hour-long monthly chats with Hindley, was sufficiently impressed to suggest  a ‘target date’ be set so that  ‘parole should be a practical possibility’. By 1977 Hindley’s obsession with course work – tackling subjects as diverse as The Age of Revolution, the 19th Century novel and its legacy, and 20th Century poetry – meant she put on weight through lack of exercise. After Hindley was transferred  to Durham Prison, a tutor remained sceptical about her motives for self education, saying: ‘Her outside contacts and studies are convincing her she is more able than I think she is. I admire the way she refuses to allow herself to become a cabbage. But I do not trust her. ‘She often appears to me to be a scheming woman, building up  contacts with anyone she thinks has influence.’ By 1981, a report concluded: ‘She has changed from the brassy blonde of more than 16 years  ago to the current picture of an intelligent, well-educated woman who possesses some taste and whose views seem culturally more attuned to middle-class values.’ Yet she never lost the ability to manipulate others. Jailed: Hindley was put in charge of the kitchen on E wing at Holloway Prison in North London and died in 2002 at Highpoint Prison, Suffolk . ‘She was cold and calculating and devoid of emotion, able to smile or cry as the need arose.’ By the time she confessed to the two further child murders Hindley was writing a book and keeping  up with ‘national and inter-national affairs by reading the Guardian and listening to the radio’, said a report. It added: ‘She has developed a particularly good relationship  with her personal officer and in fact rehearsed her confession to her before her formal interview with police.’ Hindley was transferred to Highpoint Prison, Suffolk, in 1998 and spent her final years in ‘unofficial segregation’ with a television, video recorder and word processor in her single room. She pursued a long campaign for parole which was always denied her by the courts and the Home Secretary.","Prison papers about Myra Hindley released early to national archives .

"By . Emma Reynolds . PUBLISHED: . 04:55 EST, 2 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:03 EST, 2 January 2013 . A high school football player who clashed heads with an opponent during a game thought little of the knock. But after hitting his shoulder during practice days later, he was left in a coma with a huge brain swelling and internal bleeding. Six years later, aged 23, he struggles to remember things from just hours earlier and cannot walk unaided. Cody Lehe, from Indiana, is one of dozens of promising young footballers to have fallen victim to the terrifying 'Second Impact Syndrome'. Scroll down for video . Horrific: Cody Lehe, 17, was left in a coma after a double head trauma caused his brain to swell and fill with blood (file picture) SIS is very rare and always happens to high school or college-age players, according to  Dr Michael Turner, whose case study on Cody was published yesterday in the Journal of Neurosurgery. 'It's probably something to do with the . immature brain, because our brain really keeps growing until you're 18, . 19 years old,' said Dr Turner. For years, doctors believed teenagers who . suffered from SIS had blood clots from their first concussions, which went unnoticed until the second impact triggered brain swelling and further . bleeding. But Cody had had a CT scan after the head clash, . the first to exist for an SIS patient between hits, which showed nothing. Dangerous: Second Impact Syndrome is thought to cause blood vessels to swell and push against the brain, causing the loss of ability to walk, talk and recall simple things . No one had been especially worried about Cody, because he had not passed or thrown up as a victim of concussion normally would. After taking . the second hit, however, the 17-year-old walked off the field and toppled . forward into another player, dizzy, his legs numb. Then he collapsed, his body shaking with seizures. Dr Turner now believes that Cody's brain sent a message . to the rest of his body for more blood, which filled the veins and . arteries in his head and caused his brain to swell against the skull, causing further injury and damage. The ambulance technicians told his mother Becky that they didn't think he would make it to the hospital, she told ABC News. Cody had to spend 55 days in the intensive . care unit - the same number as the one on his football jersey - and a further 43 in its rehab unit. He had suffered temporary cardiac arrest, hypertension, . pneumonia, renal failure and sepsis. He could not walk or talk. SIS occurs when a person - most often a teenager - sustains a second head injury before recovery from an earlier head injury is complete. The second hit causes the brain to swell catastrophically, but it is the first injury that makes the player a walking time bomb. If, within several weeks, the victim suffers a second head injury, brain swelling, internal bleeding and death can occur within minutes. Experts believe that after the second hit, the brain loses its ability to auto-regulate. Blood vessel walls become less stiff and expand like a garden hose that becomes fatter as it ages. If enough blood vessels swell, it makes the brain bigger, squashing tissue up against the skull. There is serious concern about this problem in sport because so many players suffer head injuries. Nobody knows the true number because they are often dismissed as 'dings' and 'bell-ringers'. Cody has regained the . ability to speak, but still lacks short-term memory. He can walk on a . treadmill for six minutes at a time with someone at his . side, but he can't balance on his own and depends on a wheelchair to get . around. 'For someone who wasn't supposed . to make it through, he's beaten all the odds,' said Mrs Lehe, adding that . she now sees a different side to her son that had previously been . reserved only for his school friends. 'He was a class clown. He was . hilarious, but we didn't see that much at home.' Dr Turner said Cody's case showed that athletes need . to get off the playing field if they've had head injuries. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has released guidelines . suggesting that players with signs of concussion should be removed from . play and not return until they have permission from their doctor and . show no symptoms with exertion. In August 2011, 22-year-old starting fullback Derek . Sheely died a week after collapsing at football practice at Frostburg . State University. His uncontrollable . brain swelling led doctors and his father to believe it was SIS. An estimated 1.7million people receive a traumatic brain injury, including concussions, each year, according to the CDC. Cody's mother Mrs Lehe added: 'I think the biggest thing is we have got to get the kids to understand to listen to their bodies. 'We have this gladiator mentality . out there,' she said. 'Be tough. Hang in there. Take one for the . team... We've got to change.' VIDEO: How a head knock could endanger your child's life .

That adds up to a staggering £676m nationally, according to the latest study. They know exactly what they like and don't like so if Santa brings something that's not on their list, they simply won't use it - regardless of cost. Bin it: Women will throw out millions of pounds worth of unwanted beauty products this Christmas . The average woman will throw away two Christmas beauty gifts, worth an average £26.36 and one in five admit they'll chuck out 'wrong' gifts that cost friends or relatives £60. If the cosmetics aren't right they'll bin them during the rest of the year - one a month on average. It may have cost a fortune, or taken weeks to find, but if it's the wrong shade, or not the preferred brand, it'll end up in the bin. Women shopping for themselves buy three new beauty products a month but stick firmly to the tried and tested brands they know and trust. More than seven out of 10 women say they continue to buy the same beauty products because of 'positive usage' whereas just 12.4 per cent buy on the recommendation of others. Fussy: Women know exactly what they want when it comes to beauty . A further 18.5 per cent buy the same beauty brands out of loyalty and some 24.7 per cent buy the same brands because of habit. The national study by teeth whitening brand BlanX did offer a glimmer of hope for Britain's menfolk though. If totally bemused by the sheer plethora of beauty products available in the marketplace, play it safe and plump for bath and body goodies - the No1 Christmas beauty choice among British women. Failing that, make-up comes in a close second and fragrance is third most popular - just be sure that you know which brand your lady prefers or you may as well stuff your hard-earned cash straight in the litter bin. Louise Mark, of BlanX, said: 'British women are very loyal to their favourite brands and tend to want to stick with the beauty products they know and love. 'They very rarely choose a new beauty product based on a recommendation from others and choose their make-up and other beauty essentials out of habit, loyalty and, most importantly, because it has had a positive result for them in the past. 'Men need to be aware that it is easy to get it wrong when buying beauty products for their ladies at Christmas and British women are not scared of being ruthless when it comes to their beauty regime. 'If it doesn't work for them, no matter how much it cost or who bought it for them, it's going to end up in the bin.

Escalating violence between between government troops and rebel fighters forced authorities to close the airport in Aleppo, Syria's largest city. Rebels have stepped up their attacks on airports in the province in an attempt to curb deadly air strikes by President Bashar Assad's forces. The Government-backed air force has been targeting rebel positions in recent weeks and attacking towns under opposition control. Scroll down for video . Ravaged: The burned out remains of an emergency vehicle in Aleppo, where violence has escalated in recent weeks with rebels specifically targeting Government-controlled air bases . Fatal: Fighting in Aleppo has intensified with rebel forces specifically targeting air bases. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said fighting led to closure of Aleppo International Airport on Monday . The rebels have been attacking three . other airports in the Aleppo area, including a military helicopter base . near the Turkish border. Videos online appear to show fighters shooting mortars, homemade rockets and sniper . rifles at targets inside the bases. Assad's ability to attack from above poses one of the biggest obstacles to rebel forces, who have much more limited weaponry and military capabilities. The rebels' attempts to capture Aleppo have led to an increase in violence in the embattled country, which has been locked in civil war for 21 months as opposition forces try to overthrow authoritarian leader Assad. The bloody war has resulted in almost 40,000 deaths so far. Control of Aleppo is seen as a key element of the war and rebel forces have been attempting to take control of the city since the summer, having captured large swathes of territory in the province west and north of the city. Concern: A girl looks up to the sky after hearing the sound of shelling in Aleppo. Rebels have stepped up their attempts to overthrow President Bashar Assad's forces in the city . Isolated: Children sit on school benches at Al-Tawheed school in Aleppo. The city has been a focal point of the bloody war in Syria that has reportedly killed 40,000 people . The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an anti-regime activist group, said the fighting around the base of Syrian army Brigade 80, part of a force protecting Aleppo International Airport, led to the closure of the airport late Monday. 'Heavy fighting is taking place around Brigade 80,' said Rami Abdul-Rahman, who heads the Observatory. 'The airport has been closed since yesterday,' he said. The Syrian government did not comment on the closing of the airport. Syria's national airline also canceled a flight to Aleppo because of fighting nearby on Saturday. Rebels have warned that they would target civilian as well as military planes using the Aleppo airport, saying the regime is using civilian planes to bring in supplies and weapons. There has also been heavy fighting in the Damascus suburb of Daraya, southwest of the capital. Threat: Rebel fighters launched a major offensive on Aleppo in mid-July but the city had remained in stalemate until recent weeks . Desperate: Children cutting a tree branches at a public park to be used for heating in Aleppo . Daraya is one of the closest suburbs to the capital and is on the edge of two important neighborhoods that are home to a strategic air base and government headquarters. Although the regime still tightly controls much of Damascus, its seat of power, rebels have been posing a stiffer challenge in the suburbs. In the past few weeks, there has been fighting near the capital's international airport that interrupted some flights. The road to the airport, just south of the capital, was also closed during the fighting. The Observatory and activist Mohammed Saeed, who is based near Damascus, said Syrian warplanes bombed Daraya on Tuesday. State-run news agency SANA said troops killed 'tens of terrorists' in Daraya and nearby areas. The regime refers to rebels as 'terrorists.' Keeping warm: Boys collect wood to be used for fire in Aleppo as winter threatens the city's impoverished and homeless . 'The regime is doing all it can to regain Daraya. The regime is dying to get back it back,' said Maath al-Shami, an activist based in the Syrian neighborhood of Mazzeh. He added: 'Daraya is the gate of Damascus for the rebels.' Amateur videos showed smoke billowing from Daraya from what activists said were the air raids. Another video showed a street covered with debris as fire raged on the second floor of a five-story building. In August, activists reported that between 300 and 600 people were killed in Daraya over several days in a killing spree by troops and pro-regime militiamen who stormed the town after heavy fighting and days of shelling. The Observatory and al-Shami reported sporadic shelling and clashes in southern neighborhoods of Damascus and the Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk on Tuesday. The Observatory said shelling and snipers fire killed two people in Yarmouk and two in another neighborhood.","Rebel forces targeting airports in attempt to curb President Assad's air force .

Accused: A police report said Marianne Porcaro's underwear rampage was sparked by her pregnancy and a six pack of beer . Police officers were called to the . hotel at 12.30am and were told that the she had been running around in . her bra and panties and knocking on doors of other guests, the report said.

James Bond was far from the suave, English gent portrayed in the 007 films, but rather a more troubled, heavy-drinking character, the new Bond author claims. William Boyd, the novelist famed for 'Any Human Heart', and responsible for coming up with the next Bond novel in the Ian Fleming series, said that Bond's true character, until now, had been underplayed. He told the Radio Times that in the Dr. No film, starring Sean Connery, Bond downed two bottles of bourbon, a bottle of champagne, a calvados and four dry martinis in one night. Scroll down for video . Time out in the tub: James Bond was a bigger drinker than we have been led to believe claims next Bond author William Boyd . Martini, shaken.... you know the rest: The real Bond was not the suave Roger Moore-type English toff at all (left), but rather 'nuanced and interesting', said Boyd. Daniel Craig, right, with a Martini in Quantum of Solace . 'In the films Bond is a cartoon character but in the novels he is far more troubled, nuanced and interesting', he said. It is the clearest indication yet that the author plans to steer away from what he described as the 'cartoon' portrayed on film and take Bond in a direction more in keeping with the character's true self. He pointed out that while the latest 007 film Skyfall sees Bond return to what is described as his childhood home in Scotland, the reality is that Bond actually grew up somewhere in Wiltshire, England. Skyfall does, however, hint at Bond's darker side when he is shown at the beginning of the film looking washed-up and drunk, downing his sorrows in a beachfront bar. Boyd admitted, however, that he deliberately avoided watching the latest film. The portrayal of Bond as an English toff is also flawed, claimed Boyd, who said: 'Bond’s father was Scottish and his mother was Swiss so he didn’t . have a drop of English blood in him. He’s not the suave Roger Moore-type . English toff at all.' While some might argue that Bond's Eton credentials justify his English gent persona, the fact, as Boyd pointed out, is that he actually got expelled from Eton after a fling with a maid and completed his schooling at Tony Blair's alma mater, Fettes in Edinburgh, Scotland. Realist: Bestselling Scottish author William Boyd said he was much more interested in creating a Bond that is a 'human' not a 'cartoon' Like Bond, Boyd was also educated in Scotland, at Prince Charles' former boarding school Gordonstoun, having spent his early life growing up in Ghana, Africa. He then went on to study and teach at Oxford University before abandoning it following the success of A Good Man in Africa, published in 1981. In April this year it was announced that he would would write the next James Bond novel, having accepted the privilege from the Ian Fleming estate. It is understood that the book will be set in 1969 and Bond will be middle-aged, at 45. Boyd’s Bond book will be published next year, 60 years after the publication of Fleming’s first Bond novel, Casino Royale. Fleming went on to write another 13 in the series, which has totted up sales of more than 100million. Speaking at the Hay Festival earlier this year, Boyd said: 'He is a middle-aged man, a middle-aged spy, and that’s one of the things that interests me. 'I’m a realistic novelist and what interests me about Bond is the human being. 'There will be no mountains filled with atom bombs or global plagues, no gadgets, no superpowers or preposterous enemies - there will be an entirely believable psychopath, not a preposterous psychopath. 'And similarly with love affairs - in my novel they will be entirely believable.” He added: 'The literary Bond is a far more interesting character than the Bond of the films, who is a sort of cartoon. Boyd is the latest of three writers to take up the challenge of . recreating the much-loved character. Sebastian Faulks released . Devil May Care in 2008 to mark the centenary of original author Ian Fleming’s birth while . Jeffery Deaver’s Bond novel, Carte Blanche, was published last year. Misportrayed: 007's Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig sipping Martinis in their tuxedos does little to portray the real Bond, constructed by Ian Fleming, believes William Boyd .

The Mail on Sunday’s campaign to end the scandal of bogus whiplash claims ended in victory last week, as the Government announced a tough crackdown on motorists who fake or exaggerate their injuries. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling announced that independent medical panels would soon assess the validity of cases – and that it would become easier for insurers to challenge claims in court. The reforms follow a series of Mail on Sunday reports exposing the activities of Britain’s 5,300 claims management companies, showing how they refer car-crash victims to no-win, no-fee law firms in exchange for cash. Getting tough: The Government plans to crack down on motorists who exagerate or invent whiplash injuries (file picture) Dodgy: How the MoS has highlighted the scandal . We also revealed that more than 700 such firms been shut down by the Government for malpractice. There has been a 60 per cent rise in personal injury claims related to road accidents since 2006, despite a 20 per cent reduction in reported collisions. Experts estimate that there are 1,500 whiplash claims every day, costing £2 billion a year and adding about £90 to every  motor insurance policy. Mr Grayling said honest drivers had been paying for a system open to abuse by fraudsters. ‘We are proposing action to support effective whiplash diagnosis by medical experts and to simplify procedures that will help to bring speculative  or fraudulent claims before  a judge,’ he said. The Association of Personal Injury Lawyers criticised the proposals, saying they would ‘cripple access to justice for vulnerable people’. Increase: There has been a 60 per cent rise in personal injury claims relating to road accidents since 2006 (file picture) But a spokesman for the Association of British Insurers said: ‘For too long, whiplash has been seen as the “fraud  of choice”. ‘More effective diagnosis of whiplash will help genuine claimants get paid out quickly  and reduce the scope for fraud, so helping to ensure that honest motorists do not end up footing the bill for the cheats.’ There will now be a three-month public consultation on the proposals, which are among a series of measures aimed at cutting legal costs and halting the growth of compensation claims in England and Wales. Ministers said the industry had promised savings arising from the whiplash reforms would be passed on to motorists. Premiums could fall by up to £50 a year if the clampdown is successful.","Justice Secretary Chris Grayling announced that independent medical panels will asses the validity of whiplash cases .

The New Year’s celebrations got off to a terrible start for many Lloyds customers who were unable to get their money out of cash machines or pay by card. Gremlins in the state-backed lender’s computer systems left many stranded without money as they prepared for the biggest night out of the year. Revellers also received a nasty shock when the credit in their current accounts appeared to have been wiped out. A terrible start to the New Year: Many Lloyds customers were unable to get their money out of cash machines or pay by card . The problems, which kicked off from 4pm, affected those with Lloyds TSB, Bank of Scotland and Halifax bank accounts. Halifax and Bank of Scotland are both part of the Lloyds banking group, which has 22million current account customers and received a £20billion bail out during the financial crisis. Frustrated consumers took to Twitter to complain. Steve J tweeted: ‘Cash machines don’t work, debit card refused (so no cashback). What a great time for computer problems. Thanks’. Brendan Clark wrote: ‘Lloyds TSB has gone down again. Completely unacceptable. New Year resolution. Switch to a better bank.’ Christina G said:  ‘I’m with #Lloyds (sic) my card was declined at train station, managed to get cash from cash point but receipt said my balance is £0!’ 'Unacceptable': Customers were outraged that they could not take out money from ATMs . Many also complained about their current account balances reading zero. Rachel tweeted: ‘Lloyds online banking isn’t working and has wiped my balances down to zero. I hope to God this is a late millennium bug and our debt is wiped.’ Lloyds claimed the problems were resolved within an hour. But the creaking computer systems of Britain’s biggest banks have been under the spotlight since millions of Royal Bank of Scotland and NatWest customers were locked out of their accounts due to a technical problem in June. It has set aside £125million to compensate customers. The latest glitch caps a calamitous year for Lloyds, which was forced to set aside another £1.4billion to pay compensation to customers mis-sold payment protection insurance. This takes the total amount set aside to £5.3billion. Lloyds apologised for the problem but failed to explain how it had happened. A spokesman said: ‘For a short period earlier this afternoon some customers experienced intermittent problems with certain functionalities of viewing their current account balances and payment transactions. ‘We were able to quickly identify the root cause and all services were fully restored within the hour.

Charlotte Hutton: 'It gave me financial independence' School leavers are to be urged to go straight into professional jobs as apprentices without getting a university degree. Oxbridge-educated skills minister Matthew Hancock has announced schemes to throw open the doors of the professions to non-graduates so that teenagers can train as lawyers, accountants and insurance brokers. He said youngsters who go straight from A-levels into training for high-flying City careers, can immediately receive a salary and many see a faster rise up the career ladder than graduates. Mr Hancock, who holds degrees from both Oxford and Cambridge universities, and worked as a Bank of England economist before entering politics, said that if he was leaving school today and had the option of an apprenticeship 'I would have considered it'. Auditors and accountants can now train straight from school at the professional services giant PricewaterhouseCoopers, while a law course for school leavers being designed with BPP, a chain of law schools in eight British cities, is set to begin in September. A scheme for insurance professionals is already up and running which allows them to qualify in three years – a year ahead of their peers who do a three-year degree and then must do a year of on-the-job training afterwards. Mr Hancock said: 'The idea is it will allow more people to think, at the age of 18, if I want to be a lawyer or an accountant I don't have to go to university to do it. 'Instead of three years of an undergraduate degree and a couple of years afterwards, you can qualify as a lawyer quicker and get paid for doing it.' 'We have started with these three professions but I see this as very much demand-driven and if any other professions come forward I'm all ears. These apprenticeships reflect the economy how it is now, not how it was 20 years ago.' However, Professor Les Ebdon, director of the Government's Office for Fair Access, said intelligent, motivated students would be best off going to university. Academic study, he told the BBC's PM programme, would broaden their horizons, hone their writing and debating skills and give them a professional network for life. 'We are trying our best to remove barriers,' he said. 'If you have the potential, you should look to university. It's the best career move you can make, and nobody regrets education.' Some professionals such as solicitors used to be able to do all their training on the job without taking a degree, although they still had to obtain professional qualifications. But such apprenticeship-style training was phased out several decades ago. Around 500,000 young people a year become apprentices in careers such as engineering and construction. Britain's biggest firms such as BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce have large apprenticeship schemes. But Mr Hancock said the aim was to broaden it out to white collar careers, with a £25million fund for professional apprenticeships set up by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. 'I have nothing negative to say about university, you learn an awful lot there, but this gives 18-year-olds more options, and that's especially important to ensure everyone who is bright has a chance to access the professions,' he said. 'It's a paid job – that's an important principle. Apprenticeships not only mean people are paid while they are learning but they learn faster and learn very practical skills for that job, which raises morale for the apprentice and everyone in the workplace.' Opportunities: Mr Hancock said a university education 'is not for everyone' but that all youngsters should have the chance to aim for 'valuable jobs' in areas such as a law, financial services and engineering . He said social mobility was the main . aim of the scheme, but that apprentices could also be a good 'export . market' as Britain has a strong professional services sector whose . employees are sought after in emerging markets such as China, India and . Brazil. From next year firms including KPMG, Jaguar Land Rover, Capgemini, IBM and Microsoft are planning schemes. Jane . Bolton, chief operating officer at the National Apprenticeship Service, . which delivers the schemes, said that in the past year increasing . numbers of high-achieving school leavers have given up university places . for on the job training. 'I . recently visited apprentices at Rolls-Royce, one of whom gave up a . place at Oxford to study maths,' she said. 'Another girl we had works . for BAE Systems. She got great A-level grades and was destined for . university but decided not to go. 'Apprenticeships . are no longer just for crafts and with the cost involved in going to . university, and the attraction of being employed and earning money from . the beginning, it is a  serious contender for some young people.'","Skills minister Matthew Hancock plans 'professional' apprenticeships .

The Chancellor George Osborne hailed the deal, signed in 2011, as the largest tax evasion settlement in UK history . Thousands of wealthy British investors hiding money in Swiss bank accounts will finally be forced to pay billions in unpaid tax under a deal that comes into force today. Under the settlement between UK and Swiss authorities, an estimated £5billion will be clawed back and handed to HMRC over the next six years. The deal, signed in 2011, was hailed as the largest tax evasion settlement in UK history by Chancellor George Osborne. However last night critics attacked the deal as shielding ‘criminal tax avoiders’ – because they will be allowed to remain anonymous to HMRC as long as they pay what they owed in the first place. The actual number affected by the deal is unknown because Swiss banks are notoriously secretive about clients – but they are likely to include anyone from investment bankers to celebrities and criminals. The rich, many of whom have been hiding their wealth for decades, will see unpaid tax deducted from profits on investments and savings at the end of May. At the end of May they will be given a final chance to disclose their affairs and pay what they owe. If they do not, the money will be deducted automatically by Swiss authorities and repatriated to the UK. The charge will be based on the amount of years the money has been hidden, the type of income and the prevailing tax rate in the UK and will range from 21 per cent to 41 per cent. It is estimated the move affects £40billion of assets held in Swiss accounts by British investors. But tax campaigner Richard Murphy said: ‘Honest taxpayers are seeing criminals who broke the law being allowed to wipe the slate clean.’ ‘They should be forced to pay penalties and hand back interest on money they have kept illegally.’ ‘A similar agreement was rejected by the German parliament in November due to concerns that tax evaders would be able to retain their anonymity.’",HMRC to claw back money British investors have hidden in Swiss banks .

Any petition posted on the site that attracts more than 25,000 signatures guarantees a response from the U.S. government. The petition was launched after Mr Morgan . repeatedly attacked pro-gun guests on his nightly CNN shows following . the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, in which 20 children and six . sadults died. He called Larry Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners for America, an 'idiot,' 'dangerous' and an 'unbelievably stupid man' after he argued . that more guns would cut crime. In another debate on gun control, an exasperated Mr Morgan shouted down . economist John Lott, author of More Guns, Less Crime and accused him of 'lying' over gun crime trends in foreign countries including Britain. Gun rights advocates, who have been forced on the back foot by public . outrage over the Connecticut school killings, were furious over the . attacks - particularly as they came from a foreigner. The petition on the White House website reads: 'British citizen and CNN . television host Piers Morgan is engaged in a hostile attack against the .

The signatures surpassed the 100,000 mark after Morgan published a 2,500-word piece in the Daily Mail in which he concluded that if the U.S. does not change its gun laws he would consider deporting himself . 'We demand that Mr Morgan be deported immediately for his effort to . undermine the Bill of Rights and for exploiting his position as a . national network television host to stage attacks against the rights of .

White House website and the administration has to respond if it collects . at least 25,000 signatures within 30 days. Morgan has made it clear in TV debates that he was not attacking the . Second Amendment, which gun advocates insist protects a citizen’s right . to bear arms. But the American establishment is usually terrified of doing anything . that could be deemed anti-constitutional and even Morgan’s on-air CNN . colleagues looked taken aback by the force of his anti-gun outbursts. Morgan, who also writes a column in the Mail on Sunday's Live magazine, has refused to  back down. Hitting back: Morgan has responded to the growing petition with a series of tweets .

Parents who parked outside their home as they carried their seriously disabled boy to their car were shocked to see they had been given a ticket. Karl Wade, 37, briefly left his Nissan Note people carrier in front of his house as he and his partner Rebecca Harbourne, 28, strapped splints to the legs of four-year-old Devon, who has cerebral palsy and cannot walk. When they emerged from the front door with their son minutes later, however, they found they had been issued with a £70 fine. Despite pleading with the warden to use some common sense, the ticket stood. The local council has refused to refund the fine, saying the couple had been warned parking on their road was to be suspended temporarily because the road was being resurfaced. Miss Harbourne said: ‘At a time of goodwill to all men, I don’t think they’ve shown a lot of heart.’ Devon is paralysed down his left side, can only crawl and has a mental age of 18 months. His parents, whose home does not have a drive, usually have no problem parking outside their front door so they can carry him to the car to take him to school. Mr Wade insisted he had been told he could park in the space by workmen. Despite his protests, the warden refused to back down and told him to get in touch with the council. Two subsequent appeals have been dismissed by Birmingham City Council. Mr Wade said: ‘They don’t seem to realise we have no choice. We are law-abiding people, but there was nothing else we could do.’ 'The car park at the back was blocked with vehicles.' Father-of-three Mr Wade, who had just . dropped his other sons Lewis, ten, and Devon's twin Dallas, at school, . said he has even taken pictures of other cars parked on the road at the same time which did not receive tickets - but to no avail. Refused: Birmingham city council has rejected two appeals from the couple over the parking fine but both have been rejected . A Birmingham City Council spokesman said the family's car was reported as 'obstructing' the resurfacing work. He said: 'Letters were sent to all the properties in Minstead Road advising of the roadworks and temporary parking restrictions. 'This was followed up with warning notices and the road was well marked with restriction signs. 'Miss Harbourne has had her representation against the ticket turned down but she still has a right to appeal to an independent adjudicator. 'Other vehicles did not receive tickets as they were parked on sections of the road that had already been resurfaced and were not obstructing the work.'","Karl Wade and Rebecca Harbourne had been fitting special splints to son Devon, four, when warden appeared .

A 12-year-old schoolboy suffered horrific injuries from a savage dog attack before being saved by a hero neighbour, who fought off the vicious animal with a metal tube from a vacuum cleaner. Louis Currie, 12, of Droylsden, Greater Manchester, could have died in the attack by the pit-bull type dog but for the bravery of Stewart McGuinness, 45, a mini-sweeper driver for Salford City Council. The animal sprang from a garden as Louis rode his scooter to a friend's house - tearing a chunk out of his leg and sinking its teeth into his arms and face. The boy was left in shock and bleeding heavily. Saved: Louis Currie, 12, (pictured left with his mother, Sarah) could have died in the attack by the dog but for the bravery of Stewart McGuinness (right), 45 (pictured right with the vacuum cleaner he used to fend off the dog) But he was helped to safety and the emergency services were called. Louis is now recovering at Saint Mary's Hospital in Manchester but could have lifelong scars and may need plastic surgery. His mother Sarah, who lives with Louis and his older sister Megan, 16, said: ‘Louis tried to climb onto cars and a van, but the dog wouldn't stop. Stewart got a Hoover pole and battered the dog. ‘In my eyes, he saved my son's life. Louis was very lucky. In most places the dog's teeth didn't go through major arteries or tendons - but there's muscle damage that needs to be fixed.’ Mr McGuinness said: ‘My partner Julie and I were sat watching the television when we heard a young child screaming outside. Julie looked out of the window and saw the lad being attacked by the dog. Attack: The vaccuum extension used to fend off the dog (left). A file picture of a pit bull is also seen (right) Horrific injuries: Louis, a Manchester City fan, is now recovering at Saint Mary's Hospital in Manchester but could have lifelong scars and may need plastic surgery following the attack on Sunday afternoon . ‘It was on top of him, biting him. My automatic reaction was to grab the first thing that came to hand, which happened to be the vacuum extension. I tried to force the dog off the lad. 'Louis tried to climb onto cars and a van, but the dog wouldn't stop. Stewart got a Hoover pole and battered the dog' Sarah Currie . ‘But he had him by the leg. It was vicious. It wasn't the nicest thing having to whack the dog with the pole, but I had no choice - it would have killed him otherwise. ‘Eventually I got the dog off and threw it over a fence into another garden. We locked all the gates, but we were still worried it would jump over the fence. It was a horrible dog - all muscle. ‘It was just so powerful that when I was hitting it with the pole, there was no reaction.

The company which leased the Deepwater Horizon rig to oil giant BP has been fined $1.4billion after admitting its role in the Gulf of Mexico disaster that triggered the worst oil spill in U.S. history. Swiss-based Transocean pleaded guilty to violating the Clean Water Act after its rig exploded in April 2010, killing 11 workers and spewing millions of barrels of oil into the ocean. The deal with the U.S. Department of Justice comes after BP agreed its own $4.5billion settlement with authorities back in November over criminal charges relating to the disaster. Disaster: The fire on board the mobile offshore drilling rig Deepshore Horizon following the explosion in April 2010 . The U.S. Department of Justice said Transocean admitted its crew members were 'negligent in failing fully to investigate clear indication that the Macondo well was not secure and that oil and gas were flowing into the well'. BP, which has long argued that it was not the only company responsible, said: 'In settling, Transocean has acknowledged that it played a significant role and has responsibility for the accident. Transocean is finally starting, more than two-and-a-half years after the accident, to do its part for the Gulf Coast.' Under the terms of the proposed deal, Transocean will pay its fine over five years, and the Department of Justice will not pursue further prosecution of the company. Blame: Swiss-based Transocean, which leased the rig to BP, has been fined $1.4billion after admitting its role in the disaster . Spill: Workboats are seen operating close to the Transocean Development Drilling Rig II at the site of the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico . Assistant attorney general for the US Justice Department's Criminal Division Lanny Breuer said: 'Transocean's rig crew accepted the direction of BP well site leaders to proceed in the face of clear danger signs - at a tragic cost to many of them. 'Transocean's agreement to plead guilty to a federal crime, and to pay a total of 1.4 billion U.S. dollars in criminal and civil penalties, appropriately reflects its role in the Deepwater Horizon disaster.' Halliburton, which was responsible for cementing the well, is the only company not to have settled over the disaster. BP said: 'Unfortunately, Halliburton continues to deny its significant role in the accident, including its failure to adequately cement and monitor the well.' The oil giant pleaded guilty to 14 felony . counts relating to the fatal explosion in November last year. The plea agreement . included 11 manslaughter charges, plus one felony count for obstruction . of justice relating to BP's false statements made to Congress about the . amount of oil leaking from the well.BP will pay $4.5 billion in fines and other fees to settle the charges - the largest payment of its kind in U.S. history. Last . month it was reported that BP was sending a team of investigators to . check if any further oil is leaking from the site of the 2010 spill. The . oil giant was set to investigate whether an oil sheen revealed by . satellite pictures was evidence of a possible new leak from the . containment dome put in place to secure the site, according to a CBS . News report. There were . more than 100 crew members on board the rig at the time of the explosion . on 20 April 2010, including seven BP employees and 79 Transocean team . members. Aftermath: Dead fish are seen stuck in oil in Bay Jimmy near Port Sulpher, Louisiana, in the months after the Deepwater Horizon disaster . Meanwhile the full environmental impact of the Deepwater Horizon disaster is still unknown almost three years later. Oil spewed into the Gulf of Mexico from the Macondo well for 87 days after the explosion before it was finally capped. Almost 70,000 square miles of the gulf were at one point covered in oil slick - an area roughly the size of the state of Oklahoma. More than 6,000 seabirds, 600 turtles and 500 dolphins were found dead as a result of the spill. Many . dolphins are still being found sick from apparent oil contamination. The full impact of the oil spill will not be estimated until the . government releases its Natural Resource Damage Assessment, which will . collect data from dozens of ongoing studies of the gulf.","Swiss-based Transocean's rig exploded in April 2010, killing 11 workers and spilling millions of barrels of oil .

A man who infected his former girlfriend with HIV could have passed the virus on to many more women, police have revealed. Photographer Leslie Pringle, 48, from Tynemouth, North Tyneside, was convicted of inflicting grievous bodily harm following a trial at Newcastle Crown Court and will be sentenced next month. He recklessly had unprotected sex with her despite knowing he was HIV positive. Police have now appealed to any of Pringle's former lovers to get themselves checked. They believe he had several former lovers in the North East and Yorkshire. Chief Superintendent Winton Keenan said: 'Given that Pringle may have had other . sexual relationships since he was infected we have a public duty to . publicise this case to ensure any other potential victims are made aware . and can seek advice. 'Anyone with concerns that they may be at risk should seek confidential advice from their local sexual health service provider.

'He breached her trust and showed . absolutely no regard for her personal safety by withholding the . information that he was HIV positive. 'Pringle knew he was HIV positive but . recklessly ignored the health advice he had been given by having . unprotected sexual relations with the victim.

Switzerland is the best place to be born in 2013, a new global survey laying bare the 'lottery of life' reveals. Babies born in the land-locked nation of just 8million are the 'luckiest' in the world according to researchers who also named Nigeria as the worst place to start life. Britain is ranked just 27th, behind the likes of South Korea, Kuwait and Chile, and well down on the 7th place it achieved in a similar survey 25 years ago. Wish you were there? Switzerland has been named the best place to be born in 2013 in a study by the Economist Intelligence unit, scoring countries out of a maximum of 10 . From what today’s newborns can hope to earn in 2030 to how happy a nation is, analysts from the Economist Intelligence Unit crunched the numbers on 11 different factors to decide where the luckiest babies will emerge this year. Switzerland tops the chart, scoring 8.22 out of 10, jumping from 13th place in a similar exercise in 1988. The league table has been branded ‘deadly serious’ by The Economist magazine, which suggests place of birth will become increasingly important as the world faces an uncertain future. ‘There is surely a lot to be said for boring stability in today’s (and no doubt tomorrow’s) uncertain times,’ the magazine said. Something in the air: Small mountainous countries like Switzerland (left) and Norway were highly ranked in the list of the nations newborns were luckiest to call home . The USA has fallen from the number one spot in 1988 to joint 16th while France, ranked second in 1988, drops to 26th, just ahead of Britain. Australia is second and Norway third, followed by Sweden and Denmark. Singapore, New Zealand, Netherlands, Canada, Hong Kong complete the top 10. The results of opinion polls on how happy people say there have been cross-referenced with hard facts like crime levels, wealth and health, to produce the table. Hard luck: Babies born in Britain this year are less lucky than those in South Korea, Chile and Taiwan, the study found putting the UK at 27th in the world . The EIU, a sister company of The . Economist, used 11 statistically significant indicators, including . geography, demography, social and cultural characteristics, public . policy, the state of the world economy and future income per head. The league table ‘earnestly attempts to measure which country will provide the best opportunities for a healthy, safe and prosperous life in the years ahead’, The Economist said. The study found people are living longer around the world while political freedoms have continued to spread, notably in north Africa and the Middle East as the Arab Spring takes hold. But family and community life has been hard hit in areas where unemployment has grown. In 1988 a similar study by the EIU put the USA top of the global league table . ‘Small economies dominate the top ten. Half of these are European, but only one, the Netherlands, is from the euro zone,’ The Economist said. ‘The Nordic countries shine, whereas the crisis-ridden south of Europe (Greece, Portugal and Spain) lags behind despite the advantage of a favourable climate. The largest European economies (Germany, France and Britain) do not do particularly well. ‘America, where babies will inherit the large debts of the boomer generation, languishes back in 16th place. Despite their economic dynamism, none of the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) scores impressively. Among the 80 countries covered, Nigeria comes last: it is the worst place for a baby to enter the world in 2013.’ The 1988 study, while also carried out by the EIU, was not entirely serious. It included a philistine factor for cultural poverty and a yawn factor to measure how boring a country was, which marked Switzerland score badly on both.","New index names Swiss babies as the 'luckiest' in the world .

'We have decided that no lawyer will stand up to defend the rape accused as it would be immoral to defend the case,' Sanjay Kumar, a lawyer and a member of the Saket District Bar Council, told AFP. It comes as the Indian government proposed to name a revised anti-rape law after the victim, a move her family referred to as an 'honour'.

Kumar said the 2,500 advocates registered at the court have decided to 'stay away' to ensure 'speedy justice', meaning the government would have to appoint lawyers for the defendants. Five men are expected to face charges including rape, murder and kidnapping in the Saket court, with the prosecutor likely to seek the death sentence.

A Royal Navy officer tried to tackle a junior rating who went on a murderous rampage onboard a nuclear-powered submarine before he was shot, an inquest heard today. Lieutenant Commander Ian Molyneux bravely rushed to tackle Able Seaman Ryan Donovan as he wielded the gun onboard HMS Astute while it was docked at Southampton, Hampshire, on April 8 2011. The inquest, at Southampton, was told father-of-four Lt Cdr Molyneux , known as Molly, heard the shots before rushing towards Donovan. Witnesses heard Lt Cdr Molyneux, 36, say to Donovan 'What have you done?', seconds before he was shot. The inquest was told Lt Cdr Molyneux would have fallen unconscious immediately. Donovan, 23, was jailed for life after pleading guilty to murder at Winchester Crown Court. The navigator yeoman also pleaded guilty . to attempting to murder Lieutenant Commander Christopher Hodge, 45, who . he shot in the stomach. Donovan's real targets, who he admitted . attempting to murder, were Petty Officer Christopher Brown, 36, and . Chief Petty Officer David McCoy, 37. His attack was only stopped when the leader of Southampton City Council, . Royston Smith, and its chief executive, Alistair Neill, heroically . wrestled the weapon from him. The inquest which resumed at . Southampton's Civic Centre today heard that Lt Cdr Molyneux suffered a single . gunshot wound to the top of his head, six inches above his right . earhole. Home Office . pathologist Dr Basil Purdue said the position Lt Cdr Molyneux was found lying suggested he was rushing forward to tackle the gunman. Heartbroken: Gillian Molyneux, pictured arriving at the Civic Centre in Southampton to hear the opening of the inquest . He . added that, at 6ft 2in, Lt Cdr Molyneux was a tall man and would have . had to lower his head forward in order to suffer the injury to the top . of his head. He said: 'It's not an unreasonable . presumption that he's throwing himself, rushing forwards, moving towards . him with his head down.' Dr Purdue added: 'It would have caused instantaneous . unconsciousness followed very, very shortly by death. 'The lieutenant commander would have known nothing about it.' The inquest heard that Lt Cdr Molyneux . was heard to be breathing, making a 'snoring' sound, as he lay on the . floor after being shot. Dr . Purdue said: 'It's upsetting and emotionally distressing that someone . horribly injured is still breathing but they are beyond help at that . stage. 'As soon as he received that wound, he would have been out of it completely.' Mark Mastaglio, a forensic firearms . expert, said the weapon used was a SA80 military high velocity rifle which fires . rounds at 940 metres per second and when in automatic mode can fire 800 . rounds a minute. A total of seven shots were fired during the incident, the inquest heard. Lt Cdr Molyneux's widow Gillian, who attended today's . hearing, has said previously that nothing could ever replace her . soulmate and father of Jamie, Arron, Bethany and Charlie and 'the . heartbreaking sadness for the loss of Ian'. Donovan had been drinking while ashore . and had volunteered for guard duty when onboard, because he admitted he . was intent on killing the two petty officers who had reported him for . disobeying a direct order to clean a part of the sub. Donovan was angry because he had been told he would not be . leaving the sub for an attachment on another vessel because of his . behaviour. Gunman: Able Seaman Ryan Donovan will serve at least 25 years after pleading guilty to Lt Cdr Molyneux's murder onboard the HMS Astute, right . The amateur rapper, who called himself Reggie Moondog, was given the weapon and 30 rounds by PO Brown. Soulmates: Gillian Molyneux and Lt Cdr Ian Molyneux . He turned the gun on him and CPO McCoy but the men dived for cover or fled. The . crown court heard that Donovan then shot Lt Cdr Molyneux before moving into HMS Astute's control . room, which was full of local dignitaries visiting the vessel on a . five-day goodwill visit to Southampton's Eastern Docks. Horrified onlookers saw Donovan come with the gun at waist height and shoot Lt Cdr Hodge with a 'wild' expression on his face. Donovan . was then wrestled to the ground by Mr Smith and Mr Neill and the gun . went off harmlessly for the seventh time during the struggle. When questioned by detectives, Donovan said: 'I just felt that everyone was out to get me.' In mitigation, Christopher Parker QC said that Donovan, from Dartford, Kent, was immature and not mentally ill but he could not handle stress. Sentencing, Mr Justice Field called the shootings a 'murderous onslaught'. The inquest, which has been held at the discretion of coroner Keith Wiseman so the full facts of Lt Cdr Molyneux's death could be heard, was adjourned until tomorrow.","Ian Molyneux was shot in the head by Ryan Donovan onboard HMS Astute .

But Wyll made his version, sung in a Norfolk accent, in half an hour with the help of his metal worker father Andrew, 54, in the garden of his grandmother's rural home in Bunwell, Norfolk. While the real song repeats the words 'Hey pretty lady', Wyll - who admits the song is a tongue in cheek look at the many stereotypes given to his home county - sings 'Hey inbred lady' as a cheeky reference to a joke that East Anglia people are inbred. The teenager pokes fun at Norfolk's love of a 'nice hot brew' Wyll admits the song is a tongue in cheek look at the many stereotypes given to his home county - including that residents enjoy drinking cider . He swaps the words to talk of his fellow countymen's love of a 'nice hot stew' His . song has the chorus: 'Cuttin' trees down, and drivin' tractors, that's . what I like, that's what I like, and that's just the way I Iike to live . my life - we got Norfolk Style.'

It rapidly became a hit around the world with people viewing it as far away as Australia and South Africa. Wyll's video was trending as the most . popular music video on YouTube on Sunday and Monday and by this morning . it had been viewed 254,361 times.

Pet hate: Radio 2 presenter Sir Terry Wogan bemoans his lack of ability to open a tin of sardines on BBC1's Room 101 . His wry observations on the absurdities and dilemmas encountered in life helped to turn Sir Terry Wogan into a household name. Now the 74 year old broadcaster has turned his attention to the daily battle his generation faces with difficult packaging. From the sardine tin that won’t open to the toothpaste enclosed in fortress-like plastic, Sir Terry does not hold back from voicing his frustration in the new series of BBC1’s Room 101. Discussing his pet hates with host Frank Skinner, Sir Terry said: ‘It’s food packaging in particular – with sardines or pilchards in a tin you put your finger in the ring thing, dislocate your finger and break your nails. ‘Then the damn thing comes away and you’ve got to get a tin opener anyway, all for a sardine. ‘Then there are those bottles where you have to press down the top before you can open them…’ And the kitchen isn’t the only place in the house Sir Terry faces the perils of packaging. He continued: ‘Taking things further it becomes very difficult to open things when you get to my distinguished age. ‘Has anyone tried to break into a toothbrush lately? ‘You’re in the bathroom and you think, ‘I’ll restore my dentures to their pristine glory’. I’ve got a new toothbrush here but can I open it?’ During the programme, which will be broadcast later this month (Jan 11), Mr Skinner is far from sympathetic to Sir Terry’s plight, telling him: ‘It’s made me realise why old people get up so early.’ With a career spanning five decades in showbusiness, Sir Terry has no designs to settle into retirement. Earlier this year he presented seven hours of live TV for the BBC’s annual Children in Need appeal and still has his own Radio 2 show Weekend Wogan. Bugbear: One of Sir Terry's pet hates is opening a tin of sardines . Sir Terry, who was knighted by the Queen in 2005, has been married to his ex-model wife, Helen for 47 years and they have two sons and a daughter: Alan, 45, Mark 42, and Katherine, 40. His rant on packaging comes just weeks after he urged diners to protest at the food provided by some five star establishments. Long-running show: BBC1's Room 101 host Frank Skinner listened to Sir Terry Wogan's pet hates . Recalling a recent Lord’s Taverners lunch at Grosvenor House, he described the turkey as ‘an indefinable lump of rolled white meat that could have been anything’. ‘It was,’ he tells me, ‘served with sprouts like bullets, soggy potatoes and a bread sauce that would have been at home on a plasterer’s tray.’ And the Irish-born broadcaster didn’t  spare other multi-starred establishments. ‘I went to a saints and sinners lunch at the Savoy recently and the turkey was unbelievable,’ ‘They churn out this stuff at Christmas and nobody ever complains. ‘They are afraid to make a scene. ‘Nobody ever thinks: “We’d better improve our standards.” According to the latest research,  more rubbish goes to landfill in Britain than in any other European country. With items such as shrink-wrapped coconuts and single bananas sold in plastic trays. The law on excess packaging was introduced in 1999 and appears to offer a simple route to outlawing waste. It says packaging should be limited to ‘the minimum adequate amount’ to ensure safety and hygiene. However, just a handful of companies have been prosecuted, while the maximum fine is just £5,000.","Sir Terry Wogan, 74, discusses his pet hates on BBC1 show Room 101 .

Shivering and scared, these helpless puppies were dumped by a busy main road after their owner apparently failed to sell them as Christmas presents. The five, 12-week-old English Bull Terrier cross puppies were found outside the Battersea Dogs & Cats Home's centre in Old Windsor, Berkshire, on New Year's Eve. They had been left without any food or water and their coats were filthy. Recovering: These puppies were found abandoned outside the Battersea Dogs & Cats Home's centre in Old Windsor, Berkshire, on New Year's Eve, after their owner apparently failed to sell them for Christmas presents . Staff at the rescue centre fear they were bred purely for Christmas presents, but did not sell in time. Centre Manager Kaye Mughal said: 'We found the puppies in a small plastic box by our gate, so they were clearly dumped deliberately. 'Given the timing we're worried they were bred as Christmas presents by someone looking to make a quick buck, but when they failed to sell they were disposed of. 'Dumping animals without food or water near a busy main road could have disastrous consequences, but thankfully we found these pups quickly, and they’re now recovering from their ordeal.' As they were discovered just hours before the New Year, Battersea staff decided to name them Midnight, Big Ben, Chimes, Bubbles and Fizz in recognition of that night's celebrations. And they wasted no time getting them into the warmth, giving them food, drink and a much-needed wash. Cared for at last: As they were discovered just hours before the New Year, Battersea staff decided to name them Midnight (pictured), Big Ben, Chimes, Bubbles and Fizz in recognition of that night's celebrations . Having been trapped in the box, the puppies were very dirty, smelly, and desperate to escape. The festive period always has an impact on Battersea, and between 24 December and 1 January the charity’s three centres received 96 dogs and 52 cats. They included 11 cats and 36 dogs at Battersea Old Windsor, half of which were strays. Mrs Mughal said: 'Many of these strays are genuinely lost, but others are cruelly dumped over Christmas. 'We pick up the pieces when people buy pets as presents. By March, the tiny puppies and kittens given as Christmas presents are becoming more of a handful, they've lost their initial charm and are then given up. 'When it comes to gifts, please stick to toys or chocolates but not animals, as these puppies’ heart-breaking story can testify.' A Battersea staff member with Big Ben: The five puppies will need to stay at the centre for at least seven days before they can be rehomed . Like all strays, the five puppies will need to stay at Battersea Old Windsor for at least seven days before they can be rehomed. Mrs Mughal said: 'They’re all lively, fun-loving pups who will make fantastic additions to good homes. 'Fizz is a confident girl who loves a fuss, and Big Ben is her bold brother. 'Chimes is the most sensitive, while Bubbles is the shy one, and follows his affectionate brother Midnight everywhere. 'They may not have had the best start in life, but Battersea will make sure 2013 sees a change in their fortunes.'

When children’s author Beatrix Potter dreamed up the character of Peter Rabbit at the start of the 20th century, she placed him in the setting she knew best - the villages and landscape of her beloved Lake District home. Now, 110 years after the first Peter Rabbit book was published, animators have gone back to the Lake District, to create a new adaptation as close to Potter’s vision as possible. The new CGI animation, to be screened on CBeebies this afternoon is based on 3,500 photographs of the landscape around Potter’s village of Near Sawrey. Re-animated: The new CGI animated version of Beatrix Potter's Peter Rabbit will premiere on CBeebies today . Original inspiration: Using 3,500 photographs animators have tried to come as close to Ms Potter's vision as possible - this tree inspired Peter's Burrow . Coming to life: The animated version of Peter Rabbit's world, including his Burrow, have been inspired by the village on which Beatrix Potter based her books . The team - producers Silvergate Media and animators Brown Bag Films - studied the Lake District’s forests, grassy hilltops, farmyards and woodland lanes. They photographed everything, started drawing sketches, working in the characters and their homes, and turned them into an animated world that is strikingly close to the real Cumbrian landscape. The animated designs of Peter’s burrow are based on a photograph of a gnarled tree on the banks of nearby Esthwaite Water - with an added green door. Mrs Tiggywinkle’s Laundry is set at the base of a stony outcrop on fells near Potter’s village. True life: This outcrop close to the village of Near Sawrey where Beatrix Potter lived became the base for Mrs Tiggywinkle's Laundry . Stage two: After studying the photographs for inspiration the animators began to sketch the scenes and dwellings for the new series . Last stop: The final animation for Mrs Tiggywinkle's Laundry for the latest adaption of the classic children's book . And Mr Tod’s Lair is placed in a pile of twigs and branches, built around a mossy tree stump in woods close to Near Sawrey. The homes of the other characters are set in real buildings and farms from the area. The special one-off Christmas episode will be shown at 4.30pm today  with a full series to follow in the Spring. Coming to life: It may look like a mossy tree stump to most people, but to the animators this was the natural choice for Tod's Lair . Foxy dwelling: Based on the tree-stump, Mr Tod's Lair began to take shape . Final result: Tod's Lair as it will look on the small screen premiere on CBeebies later today . The episodes will revolve around Peter Rabbit and his loyal friend Benjamin Bouncer, and the producers have added a new character - inquisitive, independent Lily Bobtail. Kay Benbow, controller at CBeebies said: ‘I grew up with these books and so I am delighted to welcome this heritage brand to CBeebies. ‘This witty, exciting and action-packed realisation is true to the original work of Beatrix Potter and we believe it will have a huge appeal for the older end of our audience.’","Village where Beatrix Potter lived inspire animators of Peter Rabbit series .

But seven months on from her ordeal - which saw her suffer two brain haemorrhages, a broken jaw and multiple fractures to her legs - she is once again walking. Miracle: Chantelle Serginson, from Middlesbrough, who has said it is a miracle she can walk again after falling 80ft from a hotel balcony. Pictured with mother Kimberley (right) and sister Jessica (left) The 25-year-old said: 'Things are going brilliantly. I should not be sat here having this conversation. 'I should at least be paralysed or brain damaged but I have been miraculous. 'Doctors said it would take me around 18 months to walk again but it's taken me around four-and-a-half months. 'I can't overdo it and I am still on medication but I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.' Miss Serginson had operations to have metal poles and pins inserted into her legs and hips plus metal plates in her jaw following her fall while on holiday in Magaluf in May.

She said: 'I have gone from a wheelchair to a walking frame to crutches. 'The first time my foot touched the floor I was sobbing. I can now walk to the shops but sometimes I need a piggyback back.'

'I am looking into college courses. I want to become a support worker and do something for people who can't walk. 'I know what it's like as I have been through it myself and want to help.'

British bank Standard Chartered Plc will reportedly be fined $327million (£203m) following allegations that it violated U.S. sanctions against Iran, Sudan, Libya and Burma. The U.S. Federal Reserve today said the bank will pay $100m (£62m) for providing 'incomplete responses' to examiners and having an inadequate sanctions compliance programme. This comes on top of the $227m (£141m) it is to forfeit in deferred prosecution agreements with the U.S. Justice Department and the New York District Attorney. 'Inadequate': Standard Chartered was accused of behaving like a 'rogue institution' in its New York transactions . Between 2001 and 2007, the London-listed bank carried out thousands of U.S. dollar transactions for parties affiliated with Iran, . Sudan, Libya and Burma, according to the U.S. Justice Department. In an explosive legal order, New York regulator Benjamin Lawsky claimed it 'operated as a rogue institution'. The U.S. suspects that Iran was using . its banks to finance 'terrorist groups' such as Hezbollah, Hamas and the . Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Findings include a memo sent in . October 2006 from the bank's U.S. chief executive to the group executive . director in London, raising concerns about the activities with Iran. The director allegedly replied: 'You . ****ing Americans. Who are you to tell us, the rest of the world, that . we're not going to deal with Iranians?' The U.S. Treasury Department also entered into a settlement to resolve allegations that the bank's London and Dubai offices violated U.S. sanctions against the four countries. The Treasury said it levied a $132m (£82m) penalty, but deemed that satisfied by the bank's payment to the Department of Justice. Recovery: Standard shares have recovered much of the ground lost in August, when it was hit by lurid claims it had exposed the U.S. to terrorists and drug kingpins by carrying out £160bn of secret transactions with Tehran . The federal-state settlements come several months after Standard agreed to pay $340m (£211m) to resolve a related case brought by the New York banking regulator. The bank, whose main operations are in Asia, was hit by lurid claims from the regulator that it had exposed the U.S. to terrorists and drug kingpins by carrying out £160bn of secret transactions with Tehran. Standard, which employs nearly 90,000 people worldwide and sponsors Liverpool Football Club, was initially threatened with losing its licence to operate within New York state when the scandal broke last summer. The 160-year-old lender said today that the New York settlement would push its pre-tax profit growth down to a 'mid-single digit rate' rather than in the double-digit range. Yet shares were up 1 per cent or 11.25p at 1,499.75p last week, with analysts saying that the news of how much the final payout was likely to be had removed some uncertainty around the impact of the scandal. The penalty is likely to be 'less costly than for some of its rivals', according to Richard Hunter from Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers.","The bank is set to pay £62m to the Federal Reserve and £141m to the Justice Department .

"By . Sue Mott . PUBLISHED: . 17:00 EST, 5 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:03 EST, 5 January 2013 . It was a shameless lie to the Duke of Edinburgh that pitched me into this. ‘And what sport do you do?’ he once asked sternly, glowering with apparent disapproval. No sports journalist could merely say ‘walking’ or just ‘swimming’ when Prince Philip was such an action-packed figure himself, carriage-driving well into his 80s. So on the spur of the moment I said: ‘Climbing.’ It was a wild and incontrovertible untruth. The only ascent I had ever made, apart from stairs, was Goatfell on the Isle of Arran, the summit of which is 2,867ft above sea level. Reaching the top left me feeling like Sir Edmund Hillary . . . until  I found I was sharing the achievement with a group of pensioners, a small girl in flip-flops and a large Dulux dog, all of whom had apparently rambled their way up with few signs of exertion. The only way is up: Sue Mott makes her ascent at the Castle Climbing Centre in North London . So this was the reckoning. Climbing, as a sport, is currently enjoying a huge boom in popularity. More than five million of us are now swarming up indoor climbing walls and cliff faces in our spare time, according to the annual Sport England Active People Survey, and leading gym chains have invested seven-figure sums installing climbing facilities. To the uninitiated, it might look risky, painful, vertiginous and a slow way to travel compared with, say, a cable car, but the statistics don’t lie. And it is not just big brutes in shorts getting involved, either. There has been a significant rise in women and children taking part, with 14 per cent of schools offering climbing as an activity. ‘It’s an adrenaline activity that’s also a workout,’ said Tony Ryan of the British Mountaineering Council, whose official membership is 75,000 – a quarter of them women. ‘People are climbing as part of their general fitness routine and are finding it much more exciting than going to a multi-gym. It’s not just about brute force – it requires technique, balance, flexibility and agility as well as engaging the brain.’ This may explain the number of women shimmying up the fibreglass rock faces at The Castle Climbing Centre in North London when I, with huge trepidation, went to repair my Royal fraud. On the rise: Five million Britons claim to be climbing - indoors or outdoors - in their spare time . Warning: if you are scared of heights, don’t even walk through the door. The facility is a converted Victorian water tower with walls rising on all sides, one of them rearing into the rafters to more than 40ft. They are pockmarked with small, screw-on ‘holds’ in different colours, some big enough (the comforting ‘jugs’) to accommodate both feet, some small enough to be virtually non-existent (the devilish ‘smears’). If you’re wise, you will book a five-hour training course first. Six of us quivering novices treat the instructor, Julie, as a lifesaver, because she is. We listen with riveted attention as she teaches us how to put on our harnesses and tie knots. Eventually, strapped in and sufficiently well-knotted, we are allowed to walk gingerly to our first man-made rock face. ‘OK, up you go,’ she says to the first poor guinea pig. In theory, someone is on the other end of the climbing rope and, if proper attention has been paid to the lesson, this person will act as a land anchor, preventing any accident occurring should the climber fall, faint or otherwise wimp out of their ascent. In theory. Preparations: Sue learns how to tie a climbing knot . Modern life is all about comfort, speed . and security. We don’t expect to be flung into a world where all . existence depends on finding the next tiny toe ledge. It’s inelegant, at . the very least. But then, with a lot of flapping of hands and flailing . of legs, you begin to inch your way upwards, and with each surge of . adrenaline comes a sense of achievement. While gravity is pulling one . way, sheer belligerence is coaxing you the other. Once past the point of no return – where you could just jump down safely of your own volition – you might as well keep going. The summit appears like a vision and the glow of triumph for reaching the top is really quite disproportionate to the accomplishment. Coming down is great. You just abseil, hoping your partner is doing all the right things in the right order. For a brief moment the newly hatched climber feels at one with the great Johnny Dawes (Julie’s ex-boyfriend, as it turns out), who made the first ascent in the Eighties of the notorious Indian Face route in Snowdonia. I have no idea what this means but his exploits are all over YouTube. Climbing is actually pretty safe. Academics at Oxford University have calculated the risk of death is statistically lower than for swimming, running, football and – believe or not – table tennis. This is good to know because by now the first-timer is either in love or will never knowingly be lured into a harness again. If you fit into the former category, there are 300 purpose-built, public-access climbing walls all over the UK, as well as nature’s own contribution, including the Plas Y Brenin National Mountain Centre in Wales, which runs courses. The outside version of the sport provides a whole new set of worries including wind, rain and caterpillars in crevices. For those who just fancy indoor walls as a workout, the results are spectacular. Three days after my ascent, every muscle fibre in my body was still aching, from fingertips to toenails. Clinging on for grim death is a terrific skeleto-muscular fillip, it seems. Few parts of the body are untouched by the ordeal, including the brain, which has been silently screaming: ‘No!’ for four hours. As shock therapy, it is without equal. If you’re looking to work off the inevitable damage done by festive food and drink, a trip to a climbing wall can be seriously recommended. And you may even find fame and fortune in the long run. Competition climbing is shortlisted for the 2020 Olympics. Then there is the social aspect. Relatively cheap to indulge as a passion  (The Castle charges £12 a visit for unlimited time, with shoe and harness hire on top), there is a huge variety of genders, ages and sizes in attendance. There’s nothing like making friends with someone as you plummet towards them off a boulder when that ‘crimp’ hold turned out to be no more than a ‘smear’. It may even be that romances blossom, as climbing clubs are a pool of like-minded, action-bent people, who are all literally roped together. castle-climbing.co.uk, thebmc.co.uk .","Sue Mott told Prince Philip she was a climber - and proceeded to turn the lie into the truth and learn how .

A New York Times journalist who has worked as a correspondent in China since 2000 has been forced to leave the country following the paper's report about the Prime Minister's family wealth. Chris Buckley, a 45-year-old Australian reporter known for his balanced reporting and rigor, flew out of Beijing with his partner and 12-year-old daughter on Monday after authorities failed to renew his annual media accreditation and residence visa before the December 31 deadline. He had sought to update his paperwork after leaving Reuters, a news agency and rejoining the Times in September. Despite numerous requests, authorities did not act in time and he has now flown to Hong Kong, The Times reported. Report: In October, the New York Times revealed Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao's family's wealth. A Times correspondent in China, Chris Buckley, has now failed to have his visa renewed . Requests to transfer visas in the country are usually processed within weeks and Buckley has reportedly received no official explanation about why he has not received his. The delay could be seen as retaliation for  an October 25 news report about the family wealth of the Chinese Premier, Wen Jiabao, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. The report revealed Mr Wen's relatives had acquired at least $2.7 billion in assets. Within hours of it being published, the powers-that-be in the Communist state blocked the paper's website both in English and Chinese. Searches for the publication's site . as well as the names of Mr Wen's family members were also barred on the . country's main microblog service with the Chinese government describing . the feature as a 'smear'. Kicked out: The New York Times (New York HQ pictured) said Buckley has now flown to Hong Kong . But it was just one in a series of foreign reports about how leading Communist Party families have acquired enormous wealth despite their professed socialist ideals. Bloomberg has also been blocked in China since a June 29 investigative report that close relatives of new leader, Xi Jinping, had accrued . assets of more than $1 billion. The refusal to allow Buckley to stay in the country comes despite Mr Xi's 20-year-old daughter, Xi Mingze, currently attending Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The failed visas also suggests a concerning double standard, where reporters from Chinese state media are given access to Australia and the U.S. - yet it does not appear to be fully reciprocated. The new . Beijing bureau chief, U.S. citizen Philip P. Pan, has also failed to receive accreditation, despite applying in March. 'I regret that Chris Buckley has been forced to relocate outside of . China despite our repeated requests to renew his journalist visa,' Jill . Abramson, the executive editor of The Times, said. Riches: Wen Jiabao, second right, and his family, son Wen Yunsong (left), wife Zhang Beili (second left) and daughter Wen Ruchun (right). The New York Times published a report about their wealth in September . 'I . hope the Chinese authorities will issue him a new visa as soon as . possible and allow Chris and his family to return to Beijing. I also . hope that Phil Pan, whose application for journalist credentials has . been pending for months, will also be issued a visa to serve as our . bureau chief in Beijing.' The Times noted that six other reporters in China have had their visas renewed for 2013 in a timely manner. David Barboza, who wrote the articles about Mr. Wen, was among these, they said. The New York Times article stated that the family of Mr Wen, 70, . known for his humble background - his mother was a teacher and his . father tended pigs - have accumulated most of their assets since Wen was . named vice premier in 1998 before his promotion to Prime Minister nine . years ago. The estimate of his family's wealth was made according to a review of corporate and regulatory records from 1992 to 2012. According . to the review, his widowed mother Yang Zhiyun, 90, has had just one . investment to her name - in a financial services company with assets . worth $120 million in 2007. Crackdown: China also blocked the English-language website of Bloomberg News after a June report into the wealth of the country's new top leader, Xi Jinping (pictured) Aside . from his mother, Mr Wen's son, daughter, younger brother and . brother-in-law appear to have made most of the money with their 'knack . for aggressive deal making,' as the Times describes it. The family has assets in . telecommunications companies, jewellers, tourist resorts, and banks . among other projects and the records show that family business ventures . received support from state owned corporations such as the nation's . largest mobile phone operator China Mobile. No holdings were found in Mr Wen's own name. The family also profited from . opportunities arising from state decisions according to the report - . though it is not known what role Mr Wen plays in those decisions. His wife Zhang Beili is a leading authority on jewellery and a state diamond company that she ran were privatised. Mr Wen stepped down as part of a transition of power on November 8.","Chris Buckley, 45, has worked as a reporter in China for 12 years .

Manchester United player Rio Ferdinand has provoked a backlash from football fans after asking New Year’s revellers to 'spare a thought' for him as he had to sleep in his team hotel.

Ferdinand, 34, born in Peckham, south-east London, was in the hotel ahead of United’s 4-0 win over Wigan Athletic at the DW Stadium on New Year's Day, in which he played 68 minutes to help keep his side top of the Premier League. The footballer was lambasted for the post by many of his 3.7million followers on Twitter, with Ben Randall saying: ‘Must be a hard life getting paid more in a week than most earn in a year.’ And another Twitter user, a Liverpool fan named @Scouselikebread, said: 'Will you spare a thought for the rest of the country struggling to make a living while you’re on 80k a week?'

A man has been charged with the murder of a music teacher who was stabbed to death on New Year's Day.

Greater Manchester Police said a . 45-year-old man also arrested in connection with the death has been . released on bail on suspicion of assisting an offender. Businessman Mr Kozak moved to Britain nine years ago and taught music to children at the Ukrainian Saturday School in Manchester. He was knifed after a fight apparently broke out at the flat shortly after 4.30pm. Paramedics alerted by a 999 call arrived to find Mr Kozak with fatal wounds. They took him to hospital but he died shortly afterwards . It is believed the alleged attack occurred at a top floor flat which had been rented out to two young women. Mr Kozak taught music to children at a Saturday school in his native homeland before settling in the UK in 2003. The former company director, who helped run a civil engineering firm, lived in Prestwich, Manchester with his 41-year old wife Helen. It is not known why he was at the murder scene. In a statement Mrs Kozak, 41, said: 'Yuriy was a loving husband, father and brother to us all. He loved his family and was a real home-body. 'Yuriy was born in the Ukraine but moved to Britain nine years ago and he was much loved by his local community. 'He used to be a music teacher in the Ukraine and taught children music at the Ukrainian Saturday School. He loved children and music was his passion. 'He played the piano and the guitar from a young age. 'Yuriy had a good sense of humour and he was always happy and smiling. He was always joyful and liked to make people happy. He had many friends and was very popular in the community. 'If anyone knows of any information that could help the police with their investigation into Yuriy's death, please contact them. We respectfully ask to be left in peace to grieve at our loss of Yuriy.' Kate Parkinson, 64, who lives in a council flat two storeys below the scene, said: 'We went out New Year's Eve to our local club and at around 2am we came home. 'There was nothing going on and we hadn't heard any noise like a party going on. We went to bed and were up pretty early. Crime scene: Police outside Cornwall House in Rodney Street in Salford. One man has been charged with his murder . 'The next day in the late afternoon I heard lots of talking outside and I pulled the curtains and police were everywhere, they told us 'go inside' and we did and locked the doors. I thought at first there was a madman on the loose. 'Then the police came round at 8pm asking if we'd heard anything. The flat was rented out to two foreign girls. I think they are Polish. I'm not sure how long they have been there. 'I can only assume that a fight has broken out. The girls were stood outside in their housecoats and nighties crying.

A flight instructor falsified documents so a millionaire could get a helicopter licence - just weeks before the businessman and his wife did in a crash, a court heard today. Inexperienced pilot Paul Spencer and his wife Linda died when their £250,000 black Gazelle helicopter crashed in woodland in the grounds of Rudding Park Hotel, near Harrogate, on January 26, 2008, where the couple owned a chalet. Mr Spencer had obtained his licence only a month earlier after learning to fly with instructor Ian King, who appeared at Leeds Crown Court today. Ian King, pictured right,  is accused of falsifying documents so Paul Spencer, left with wife Linda, could get a licence . King, 53, from, Wetherby, is accused of falsifying documents to have the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) grant a personal pilot’s licence to Mr Spencer on December 12, 2007. Paul, 43, and Linda Spencer, 59, who ran a . successful chain of craftware stores, died instantly when their . helicopter crashed moments after taking off. Martin Goudie, prosecuting, said documents found among Mr Spencer's personal possessions after his death revealed that he had not flown the correct amount of hours to achieve his licence. Mr Goudie said Mr Spencer's logbook, which was verified by the instructor, stated he had completed more than 51 hours of training, including the required ten hours of solo flight. However he said a personal flying sheet recorded a different set of hours, which would have left him unqualified to fly. He told the court: 'It is this document, which the prosecution says records the correct amount of hours flown. 'When you look at the solo hours flown - which is one requirement of being able to gain a licence - according to Mr Spencer’s records the amount totals 8.6 hours rather than the minimum requirement of 10.' The scene of the crash in Rudding Park in which Mr and Mrs Spencer died . The helicopter was also out of commission on a number of days when Mr Spencer was supposed to be training on it according to the official log submitted to the CAA by King in December 2007. 'That simply was a lie and he knew it was a lie and misled the Civil Aviation Authority to help Mr Spencer get his licence in quick time,' the prosecutor added. Analysis of the businessman’s on-line activity and phone records showed he was making calls and dealing with emails at many times when he was supposed to be in the air, the court was told. A Met Office expert was also used check the weather reports and found certain dates would have been unsuitable for flying, it was claimed. It was also alleged fuel receipts were also checked and again mismatches were found. The CAA only granted permission for Mr Spencer to begin his training on November 12 and King signed off on his pupil’s hours on December 5. King is accused of falsifying documents weeks before the fatal crash in West Yorkshire in 2008 . That left 'a very thin window of two to three weeks that the training was said to have taken place in,' Mr Goudie said. Mr and Mrs Spencer ran Country Baskets, a business which sold dried flowers and were regular visitors to the Harrogate hotel. They had made their home in a converted barn on the outskirts of Brighouse, West Yorkshire. The £250,000 helicopter had previously been owned by DJ Neil Fox. An Air Accident Investigation Board report into the tragedy concluded that the main contributing factors to the accident were 'the pilot’s lack of experience and probable inadequacies in his training.' King denies making false representations to procure a pilot’s licence. The trial continues tomorrow.

Dozens of badly burned books lay at the entrance. They were understood to have been piled up by the door when the fire began before being pulled away by fire crews trying to protect the front door.

Severe burning: The front door¿s brown wood was badly scorched and blackened by fire, with damage estimated at from £2,000 to £3,000, while the triple-arched porch and gravel driveway were covered in debris . A fire extinguisher on its side lay on a bookcase by the entrance. Dozens of books were left outside in the entrance as part of a charity scheme to fund the education of the cathedral’s boy choristers. The history of the Winchester Cathedral site dates back more than 15 centuries. The first holy building there became known as Old Minster and was built around 650 A.D. This soon became a cathedral and was the burial place for King Alfred the Great, King of Wessex, who died in 899 A.D. It was the priory church of monks by the 10th century before being demolished and replaced by a new cathedral in the 11th century. By the early 16th century, much of the cathedral that can be seen today was finished. Now it is the seat of the Bishop of Winchester and is home to daily prayers and sacred music. Members of the public donate books which are available for sale, either by volunteers manning the store or through an honesty system where money can be paid through a letterbox. The Dean of Winchester Cathedral, the Very Reverend James Atwell, was away on a post-Christmas break and not in the building at the time of the blaze, which happened at 7pm on New Year’s Day. Although the cathedral was largely rebuilt in the 17th century, some parts of the 12th century building remain - in particular the three-arched entrance portico where the fire was started. A Hampshire Police spokesman said: ‘A fire was discovered at the entrance to the Deanery, a building which dates back to circa 1150 and is part of Winchester Cathedral grounds. ‘The fire caused substantial damage to the doors and a number of antique books. The damage is estimated to be in the region of £2,000 to £3,000 to the doors and the value of the damage to the books is yet to be estimated.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Sean Clements due to appear today at Basingstoke Magistrates' Court .

Two little black pigs brought drama to the coastal town of Seaham after escaping from an allotment. Police raced into action as traffic was held up by the runaway pair, and one was last night under arrest after being found rooting for food in a waste bin. Pig hunt: Two of the animals went on the run yesterday but this one was caught after it stopped to raid a bin for a bite to eat . But its friend continued to show . officers a clean pair of trotters and, as night fell, the trail was as . cold as a frozen pork chop. The drama in Seaham, six miles south . of Sunderland, is reminiscent of the famous dash for freedom made by . Butch and Sundance – the Tamworth Two – in 1998. The story of the Tamworth Two was later made into a hour-long BBC television drama. They cheated the butcher’s knife by . going on the run from an abattoir, swimming the River Avon and . disappearing into a dense thicket. They were eventually caught but, . thanks to the Daily Mail, were given a reprieve from their death . sentence and lived out their days in an animal sanctuary. All went quiet in the sphere of . porcine escapology until Wednesday evening, when the two black pigs – . thought  to be Berkshire crossbreeds – made  a break from Hill Crescent . Allotments  in Seaham. One of the runaways was lassoed by . 37-year-old mother-of-three Shereen Temple, who found it in a back alley . with its snout in an overflowing bin. She is keeping it on her own . allotment until it can be reunited with its friend. Piggy dinner: This little hog was nabbed on Fox Street but his friend from the allotments is still on the loose . Neighbourhood sergeant Jim Peel of . said: 'The owner of the pigs normally whistles at them to get them to . come back. Everyone is keeping an eye out for the one which is still . missing.' Police officers were alerted to the . escapees after being called when one of the pigs was seen trotting along . the middle of the road heading towards the Dawdon Welfare Pub in the . town. Sightings of the new fugitives were reported on social networking sites as they caused mayhem around Seaham. Dan Johnson Stafford commented via Facebook said: 'Not every day you see a pig holding up the traffic lol.' Safe: The captured pig, nicknamed Porky, is now being looked after back at the allotments but is missing his partner in crime . Helpers: Painter and decorator Shereen Temple lassoed Porky with the help of her son Robert, 11 . Munching: It was this pig's prodigious appetite that caught up with it last night, and he is now being fed fresh fruit and vegetables among other delights . After capturing one of the pigs, Seaham Police tweeted: 'After struggling for 30 mins we caught the pig in Fox Street in Seaham.' Miss Temple, who helped to catch one of the runaway pigs last night. The painter and decorator helped to lasso the pig in a back alley after it was cornered by police. 'He was found in a back lane that was full of rubbish,' she said. 'He was scared when we found him, I tried to catch him but he scarpered down  the alley. 'I tried to lasso it once with a dog lead but it slipped away the first time  and the second time I managed to loop it around it's neck. 'The pig has been nicknamed Porky by some, everyone's talking about him.' Idyllic: The seaside town of Seaham is said to have been thrown into chaos by the fleeing pigs . Captured: The one pig intercepted was spotted trotting towards the Dawdon Welfare Pub . Shereen kept the pig in her allotment where she keeps 14 chickens. She also owns two horses which are kept in stables, enjoying fresh food including carrots, apples, grass roots  and some horse feed. 'He's having a good time digging up my vegetables and he's being kept  in the chicken shed for now. 'Apparently the other pig was seen near the allotments this morning, and he was caught but he got away before the officers came to rescue him. 'It's been quite exciting helping to catch them - we just want to reunite him with the other one - we don't know if it's his brother or not.' While the RSPCA took in the runaway pig, the other has still not yet been found. Police were made aware of a sighting of the other pig at Seaham Harbour around 11pm last night but when they attended, the pig could not be found. Another sighting was reported at around 8am this morning, but again when officers arrived at the scene, the pig had once again escaped. Parallels: This latest escape has reminded people of dynamic duo 'The Tamworth Two' Sundance, left, and Butch, who went on the run from an abattoir . Neighbourhood Sergeant Jim Peel said: 'We had a call around 8pm last night to say that there was a pig on the loose. 'It was running around the roads in Seaham. 'Two PCSOs and response officers attended and they chased the pig into a back alley where the pig was detained. 'That was it for about an hour until a second pig was reported to also be loose. 'About 11pm last night there was a second call saying that a pig was running around Strangford Road, Seaham. 'However when officers searched the area, no pig was found. 'Another call came in around 8am this morning to say that a pig had been seen on Mount Stewart Street in Seaham.

Sheriff Tommy Waddell says bond has been set at $150,000 for 34-year-old John - who was arrested on Monday after his release from hospital. He was treated for hypothermia and water inhalation. The accident occurred shortly after midnight on Saturday when John, his five children and three other adults — all crammed into a five-passenger Dodge Durango SUV — left the road and plunged into creek. Waddell says authorities they are awaiting the official toxicology report, which is expected today, but they are confident alcohol was involved. The victims were Dasyanna John, nine, Duane John, eight, Bobby John, seven, Quinton John, four, and Kekaimeas John, 18 months. Dianne Chickaway, 37, also died.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 10:49 EST, 8 February 2012 . Waste of money? Sheffield City Council is planning to spend £400,000 advising residents on changes to bin collections... after slashing 550 jobs . Council bosses agreed to axe 550 jobs - then decided to spend £400,000 advising residents on how to empty their bins. Sheffield City Council is planning to switch bin collections from weekly to fortnightly in a bid to save £1.6million over the next year. But the council revealed it could cost £1million to switch the service and another £400,000 in 'appropriate communication' with residents. Services are to be slashed as the council tries to find £55million in savings in the next financial year. Taxpayers will have to foot a £13million bill for the agreed 550 redundancies, most of which councillors hope will be voluntary. Union official admitted they had been consulted and said they were ‘satisfied’ with the decisions. Switching black bin collections will lead to 40 job losses at contractors Veolia and a total cost of £1m for 'changeover costs'. A further £400,000 will be spent on 'appropriate communication to ensure customers understand the changes'. Moving from a weekly to fortnightly bin collection is one of several  controversial . cost-cutting measures announced by the council in recent months. The move aims to save . £1.6million in this financial year and £2.4million in subsequent years. Cutting back: Sheffield City Council, based at the Town Hall (above), is slashing services to save £55million in the next financial year . Other cuts will be made to care and support services, arts and culture and grants for city centre events. Charges will be increased for services including use of parks and sports pitches and car park permits. In 2011/12, the council had to save £80m and cut around 800 jobs. It faces continued cuts until at least 2015/16 when the budget will have been reduced by £170m. Council leader Julie Dore confirmed the authority would accept the Government’s offer of a grant to freeze council tax next year - despite the long-term financial implications. Difficult decisions: Council leader Julie Dore (above) believes the local authority has been been dealt an 'unfair hand' by the Government . She said: 'I believe we have been dealt an unfair hand by the Government, but we have taken extremely difficult decisions to deliver a fair deal for the people of Sheffield. 'We have ensured that we have protected the most vulnerable and at the same time we have protected the services that the people of Sheffield rely on and enjoy.' John Mothersole, Sheffield Council’s chief executive, said the budget had been managed so that the heaviest burden fell on ‘back office’ functions like information technology services. He added: 'Services like adult social care will be reduced by five per cent, while IT will see a 26 per cent cut, human resources a 15 per cent cut and business strategy a 29 per cent drop. 'The job losses we are announcing are at the top end of the range we had anticipated, and we expect at least another year of cuts after this.' Mr Mothersole said the council would be forced to put £13m on one side to pay for redundancy settlements and faced higher bills because of increased demand for services and inflation. Rod Padley, of public sector union Unison, which represents 8,000 workers in the city, said union officials met senior councillors and officers each week. He added: 'We believe the council has done all it can to mitigate redundancy and maximise job opportunities for those under threat. The situation has been imposed on Sheffield by the Government.' The move comes after an announcement by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles that more than 70 councils intend to use a £250million government fund to end unpopular fortnightly refuse collections. Squeezed households across Britain will have to endure soaring council tax bills this year as local authorities continue to slash budgets. Up to a fifth are warning they may need to increase rates to protect services, despite the Government's offer of nearly £1billion to fund a freeze.","Sheffield to switch to fortnightly refuse collections....

Troubled sleepers can rest easy in a new hotel room which allows customers to sleep under the stars in the comfort of their bed. A 'secret technique' has been used to create the stunning ‘Night Sky’ at a dozen Travelodge hotels across the country. Each bespoke cosmic panorama has been created by artist Carl Marshall and his colleague who spent around three hours artistically transforming a standard white ceiling into a cosmic sky by hand painting individual shooting stars, milky ways and constellations of twinkling stars. Scroll down for video . Starry night: Guests at the Travelodge can enjoy a night under the stars in their new room . During the day, the ceilings look plain white but in darkness the stars appear to twinkle and the dust clouds seem to move mysteriously. Whilst the three dimensional effect of the ceiling also appears to fall towards the bed by around three feet, creating a sense of immersion. Carl Marshall created the ceiling by working in the dark wearing a UV headlight. He covered the ceiling with a base layer of special light-activated paint then used glow-in-the-dark paint that glows blue, green and aqua to add dust clouds, stars and their tails. The paintworks soaks up light during the daylight hours and glows in darkness. Mr Marshall from Euxton, Lancashire said: 'The exact technique I use is a closely guarded trade secret because it is so effective. 'It is a painstaking process as you have to position the colours perfectly to achieve a three-dimensional effect but the results are definitely worth it.

Travelodge created the UK’s first night sky panorama hotel rooms in response to findings from its latest sleep study which investigated the nation’s most desirable sleeping locations. Key findings from the study revealed the most desired kipping location for Britons is under a blanket of twinkling stars. Forty two per cent of adults choose a starry night sky backdrop as their most desired sleeping location in contrast to a tropical beach, rainforest and jungle.

Since the incident the Dixon family have been living separated from each other, in their respective parents homes - they have now decided to look for a new home as they are too afraid to go back to their house in Bradford, West Yorkshire, since the break-ins. Mr Dixon, 46, first noticed that the presents belonging to Elisha, six, Kieron, five, and Bethany, nearly two, were gone when he came downstairs on Christmas Eve. He said: 'The CCTV showed this lad breaking into our car on the drive. You can see him come and go six times. 'We had been buying presents throughout the year and our hall was like an Aladdin's Cave. All that was left was four or five gifts. 'When I realised somebody had stolen them I was gutted. We were really upset and couldn't believe it had happened.

Mr Dixon contacted Yorkshire Housing Association, owners of the property, about the alarm and front door lock but had been told his case was not a priority and it would take 28 days to deal with. West Yorkshire Police confirmed they were investigating the two break-ins at the property and are studying CCTV footage of a potential suspect. A spokesman for Yorkshire Housing said: 'Mr Dixon called us on December 24 to report a faulty alarm. 'We then booked this job in as a routine appointment.

We then informed Mr Dixon. 'On December 29, Mr Dixon called us again to say that the door handle is also broken due to another attempted burglary and he was concerned about the safety of the property as the alarm had not been fixed too. 'We advised Mr Dixon that there are a number of properties in the area without burglar alarms and as such we can't class this as an emergency, however we have pushed this job forward and we hope to have the alarm and door handle fixed in the first week in January.'","Burglar caught on camera breaking into Anthony and Sarah Dixon's house .

Filthy houses and flabby thighs are the things we'd most like to banish in 2013, according to new research. But although cleaning up and exercising more have been named Britain's top New Year's resolutions, most of us will give up both of them by February, as the average person sticks to their new life goals for a measly five weeks. Other top aspirations for this year include spending less money (26 per cent of respondents), dieting (21 per cent) and finding a new job (16 per cent). Scroll down for video . Some 29 per cent of British people plan to keep their houses spotless in 2013, the same amount who have made exercising more their New Year's resolution . Research by Vileda revealed that . 29 per cent of Brits plan to keep their house looking spotless next year - the same number that plan on exercising more. The top dreams for our personal lives include financial stability (46 per cent), losing weight (37 per cent) and going on an exotic holiday (22 per cent). Men appear to be more career focused than women, with 16 per cent dreaming of landing a new job and 14 per cent wishing for a pay rise. But despite 60 per cent of us making at least three resolutions each year, 49 per cent of Brits fail to stick to them for more than a month. Can you stick to your New Year's resolutions beyond February, or will you - like most of us - have fallen off the wagon by then? The older we get, the better we are at seeing our dreams through to fruition with 36 per cent of 45-54 years olds keep at least 2 dreams for at least 6 months. Londoners are most likely to make a list of their dreams, with 46 per cent of the capitals inhabitants setting themselves goals for 2013, the Welsh are least likely to make any with just 31 per cent pinpointing their aims for the coming year . Brits also have big dreams for their homes in 2013, with 45 per cent of the country claiming that they have plans to make improvements in at least one room of their home. The most popular rooms that will be getting a makeover next year are bathrooms (38 per cent), living rooms (33 per cent) and kitchens (32 per cent). Around 16 per cent of people say their top goal for 2013 is to find a new job, and 14 per cent of men would like a pay rise before the year is out . However financial concerns may scarper our plans for home improvement, with over half of respondents saying money would prevent them from following through with a re-vamp. When it comes to cleaning, the average Brit thinks they will probably only last six weeks at their new resolution. Some 6 per cent even said they'll probably give up their ambition in less than seven days, while an ambitious 12 per cent aim for more than four months. Although 46 per cent of people are dreaming of financial stability in 2013, researchers say the best way of sticking to your resolutions is to be realistic with your targets and not plan a 'complete overhaul' immediately . Lindsey Taylor of Vileda said: . ‘Exercising, dieting and giving up things such as smoking or drinking . are all traditional resolutions for the New Year. 'However, cleaning up the home is now . top of our agenda as well as cleaning up our lifestyles. Many of us . want a completely fresh and clutter-free start to the year and as they . say, a tidy house equals a tidy mind.’ Advising people on how to stick to their resolutions, she added: 'We all know it can be difficult to keep New Year's resolutions especially if we set ourselves challenging targets such as losing a lot of weight in the first month, or keeping a completely spotless home.Be realistic with your targets and don't plan a complete overhaul immediately.‘ . If so, you're a better person than most. Over two thirds of dieters will ditch their weight loss regime by the 15th of this month, according to a new poll. And weak-willed seven per cent of slimmers will give up by the end of day one. The optimum time for ditching the diet is around 11am on January 15th . with dieters claiming after two weeks and one day without any treats, . they often succumb during the morning coffee break.

How long will your diet last this year? But in the naughty corner, 21 per cent last just one week, and 34 per cent until only January 15. The survey of 750 adults by money saving website NetVoucherCodes.co.uk found that almost a third of slimming hopefuls (29 per cent) chose to join a slimming club, claiming this was the only way they were able to stay on track and keep the pounds off. Twenty seven per cent followed an online diet and weight loss plan, with the majority (43 per cent) choosing to watch what they eat, cutting out sweet and savoury treats and alcohol. Just one per cent opted to pay for a diet plan which includes ready prepared meals. One respondent said: 'Losing weight is one of my resolutions every year. Normally I watch what I eat but it never works. 'I get too tempted by the biscuits in the cupboard or even worse, end up finishing off my kids' meals before I have my own. 'This year I’m definitely trying a slimming club. Fingers crossed that’ll do the trick and losing weight will never again be on my list of resolutions.' Steve Barnes from NetVoucherCodes.co.uk, said: 'People do take weight loss seriously, especially after the excesses of Christmas and the New Year, but it seems most of us falter just after we hit the two week mark.

Victim in the family: Matt Sandusky was preparing to testify against his adopted father during the child sex abuse trial . Jerry Sandusky's own adopted son has dramatically accused him of abuse as a jury deliberates over scores of sex abuse charges against the former Penn State coach. A lawyer for Matt Sandusky said the man told authorities that the former Penn State assistant football coach abused him. Matt Sandusky is one of Jerry Sandusky's six adopted children. His lawyers, Andrew Shubin and Justine Andronici, issued a statement on Thursday naming Matt Sandusky and saying that the 33-year-old had been prepared to testify on behalf of prosecutors at his father's sex abuse trial. The statement says Matt Sandusky is 'a victim of Jerry Sandusky's abuse,' but doesn't go into specifics. NBC News reported that Matt Sandusky was to take the stand as a 'rebuttal witness' if Jerry Sandusky testified. Jerry Sandusky's defence team ultimately decided the 68-year-old former coach wouldn't speak in his own defence . Matt Sandusky's attorney's told the network: 'This has been an extremely painful experience for Matt and he has asked us to convey his request that the media respect his privacy,' they said. The statement came after jurors began deliberating 48 charges against the ex-coach. Prosecutors say Sandusky met the 10 sex-abuse victims through his charity, The Second Mile, which he established in 1977. Lawyers for Matt and Jerry Sandusky and . prosecutors did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Matt . Sandusky's lawyer says his client met with investigators very recently. Scroll down for video . New allegation: One of Jerry Sandusky's six adopted sons, Matt, has come forward through an attorney, saying that the ex-coach abused him too . Spouse: Jerry Sandusky and his wife Dottie, pictured Thursday outside the courthouse, were married in 1966, and have no biological children, but they adopted six times . Matt Sandusky went to live with Sandusky and his wife, Dottie, as a foster child and was adopted by them as an adult. Shortly after Sandusky's arrest in November, Matt Sandusky's ex-wife Jill Jones successfully obtained a restraining order forbidding the children from sleeping at their grandparents' home. At about the same time, details emerged that Matt Sandusky had attempted suicide just four months after first going to live with Jerry and Dottie Sandusky in 1995. He had come into the home through The Second Mile charity, and was first a foster child before being legally adopted. His name also came up last week during the testimony of one of Sandusky's 10 accusers. The man, dubbed Victim 4 by prosecutors, said Matt Sandusky was living at the Sandusky home on an occasion when he had stayed there overnight. When asked by prosecutors whether Jerry Sandusky ever engaged him in a soap battle in the showers, he recounted a time when he and Matt Sandusky had been playing racket ball. When they were done, he said, they went back to a locker room. Matt got undressed and got into the shower and then Victim 4 and Sandusky followed him in there, he testified. 'Me and Jerry came in. He started pumping his hand full of soap,' he said. At that point, Matt shut off his shower and left and went to another locker room to shower, the witness said. Asked by prosecutors about Matt's facial expression when the soap battles started, he replied: 'Nervous.' Jerry and Dottie Sandusky married in 1966 and have no biological children together, but adopted six times and have served as foster parents. The news comes just hours after a 30-year-old Ohio man became the first alleged Sandusky victim to reveal himself to the public, saying in an interview that he was sexually abused by Jerry Sandusky more than 100 times, starting when he was just ten. Travis Weaver said Sandusky preyed on . him after he and his brother went to a summer camp for the Second Mile, a . charity the coach founded and through which he is accused of cultivating . most of his victims. In the jurors' hands: Sandusky is pictured leaving court on Thursday after closing arguments in his child sex abuse trial . Coming forward: Travis Weaver is the first alleged victim of Jerry Sandusky to go public with his story of abuse at the hands of the Penn State coach . The revelation comes on the same day as a jury begins to deliberate Mr Sandusky's fate on 48 counts of sexual abuse charges. In closing arguments, his attorney said the accusers were liars who were hoping to cash in on legal settlements from the university. Mr Weaver is not one of the eight accusers who testified at trial, but he did tell his story to the grand jury that handed down the Sandusky's indictment, NBC News reported. An exclusive interview with Mr Weaver will air at 10pm Thursday on Rock Center. When asked what he would do if he ever met Sandusky again, Mr Weaver doesn't hesitate. Silence: For 15 years, Mr Weaver says, he thought he was Sandusky's only victim. That all changed last fall when the former coach was indicted on charges he abused other eight boys . 'I'd punch him in his mouth,' he said. 'There would be no reason to say anything. He knows what he did.' During the sex abuse trial, Sandusky's . lawyer Joe Amendola said the former coach is being railroaded by . overzealous investigators and prosecutors. He strenuously denied that . accusations and Sandusky has maintained his innocence since his arrest . last fall. Jurors in Jerry Sandusky's child sexual abuse case began deliberations on Thursday after his lawyer and a state prosecutor made closing arguments that followed seven days of testimony. The former Penn State University coach's attorney claimed all eight of Jerry Sandusky's accusers are lying about their sex abuse allegations in the hopes of winning big settlements from the college. Joe Amendola quoted Mother Theresa as he said his client had been railroaded by overzealous investigators and greedy witnesses. He told the jury that prosecutors' case 'doesn't make sense. Sandusky is accused of molesting eight boys over the course of 15 years in a case that shocked the nation and led to the firing of Joe Paterno, one of the most respected head coaches in college football history. When Amendola cited Sandusky's decades of charity work, he referred to the Mother Theresa  'Anyway.' It includes the line: 'If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives; Be kind anyway.' Amendola laid the blame for the allegations at the feet of state police investigators who he said coached the alleged victims into giving accusatory statements. Amendola . said the accusers were greedy an they lied about the abuse in the hopes . of winning big payouts from Penn State University so they could drive . new cars and buy big houses. Mr Weaver has also filed a lawsuit and is being represented by a well-known attorney who has specialized in sex abuse cases against the Catholic church. The abuse began in 1992, Mr Weaver told NBC's Rock Center, when he met Sandusky at a swimming pool at a camp sponsored by the Second Miles, which Sandusky founded to help at-risk young boys. 'It was like meeting my hero,' Mr Weaver said of Sandusky, who was once the top pick to replace legendary Penn State football coach Joe Paterno. The individual attention Sandusky gave Mr Weaver began innocently, but gradually grew more and more sinister, he said. It began with a shower in the Penn State football team's locker room. 'After the shower was over... he'd dry me off with a towel. He'd say he was trying to wrestle with me... and then it progressed into oral sex,' Mr Weaver told NBC. He always assumed he was the only victim, he said. He never imagined there have been other boys until Sandusky was arrested last fall. Mr Weaver also blasted Sandusky's wife, Dottie, who testified that she never saw or heard anything that would have made her think her husband was molesting boys. He recalled on incident when Sandusky performed oral sex on him in a bedroom across the hall from Mrs Sandusky. 'How could she not know?' Mr Weaver said. He man said the abuse continued for four years until he moved away to Ohio to flee Sandusky. Watch video here . Visit msnbc.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy .

More than 30 years after Jerry Hartfield's murder conviction was overturned he still sits in a Texas prison because two courts can't agree on what to do with him. A federal appeals court claims the 56-year-old is being illegally held since his conviction was overturned in 1983 and ordered a retrial, but the state argues otherwise, leaving both unsure what to do with his case. This spat between the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and state attorney general's office promises without found agreement a new series of legal proceedings potentially dragged out even longer before he could finally face trial. Stuck: Jerry Hartfield has remained behind bars for the last three decades despite his murder conviction's overturn in 1983 by a Texas court of appeals, pictured . He’s 'stuck,' according to his federal public defender, with Hartfield arguing his constitutional right to a speedy trial have been violated with the state failing to retry him while also not setting him free. 'It's one of those one-in-a-million deals,' Kenneth R Hawk II said of his client's imprisonment. 'When you see it, it's kind of breath taking.' Hartfield was 21 when he was convicted in the gruesome 1976 slaying of a 55-year-old ticket agent at a bus station in Bay City. Eunice Job Lowe was beaten with a pickaxe . and her body left in a bus station storeroom, where her 19-year-old . daughter found it. Waiting: After Hartfield's conviction was overturned, ordering a retrial in 1980, he's sat in a Texas federal prison waiting for that date which has still not come . Hartfield was convicted and sentenced to die, but in 1980, a Texas appeals court ordered a new trial, saying a potential juror had been wrongly excluded from the original trial because of her reservations about imposing the death penalty. Naming a previous case as an example of Hartfield's situation, his appeal states that the order for retrial 'only affected the sentence and not the determination of guilty. Nonetheless, Texas law at that time required an entirely new trial in such circumstances.' Eleven days later, then Gov. Mark White . commuted Hartfield's death sentence to life in prison. At that point, . both sides let the case lie for about 20 years. On Wednesday a federal appeals court . sent his case back to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals asking they . define the status of its ruling overturning Hartfield’s conviction. If . the Texas appeals court accepts the federal appeals court's request, it . could set off a new series of legal proceedings that ties up the . attorney general's office and drags out the case. State attorneys twice requested a rehearing on the appeals court’s decision, with the court rejecting their second request on March 4, 1983. Hartfield, described in court documents as illiterate and mentally impaired with an IQ of 51, got the ball rolling again in 2006, when he filed a handwritten writ of habeas corpus with the help of another inmate. The writ essentially said he should be retried or set free. It was rejected twice by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals before Hartfield submitted it in the federal court system. A judge there agreed with him. 'Hartfield's position is as straightforward and subtle as a freight train,' U.S. District Judge Lynn Hughes said. The state had claimed that Hartfield was legally serving the life sentence ordered by White. It said he had had one year under federal rules to file an appeal on any aspect of his case, and that year started when the retrial was ordered in 1983. Hughes disagreed, saying the clock on an appeal doesn't start until there's a conviction, and none exists in this case. 'The court's mandate was never recalled, its decision never overturned, the conviction never reinstated; yet Hartfield never received the `entirely new trial' ordered by the court,' he wrote. The state's appeal of Hughes' decision eventually ended up before a three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which described the state's defense of Hartfield's incarceration as 'disturbingly unprofessional' in its Wednesday decision. The panel had said in October that it couldn't make a formal decision on Hartfield's complaint that his constitutional right to a speedy trial has been violated because the issue hadn't been resolved yet by his state trial court in Wharton County, about 60 miles southwest of Houston. But the federal appeals judges left little doubt about their position, saying the state appeals court reversal 30 years ago meant 'there was no longer a death sentence to commute, and thus the governor's order could not have had any effect.' The state's request for a rehearing on that decision led to Wednesday's ruling. Hartfield, who is originally from Wichita, Kan., has been moved to a Texas prison hospital for an undisclosed illness and was not available for an interview. Hawk said he'd discussed the court activity with Hartfield but found it useless to write him. 'Because he can't read it,' he said.","Jerry Hartfield, now 56, was 21 when convicted for murdering a woman found beaten with a pickaxe .

Universities are closing courses to Britons while offering places in clearing to overseas students who pay tuition fees of up to £20,000 a year. Edinburgh, Manchester and Cardiff are among those taking advantage of rules which limit numbers of British students but place no restriction on recruitment from outside the European Union. Some have closed their doors to home applicants but will accept international students through clearing, which opens as A-level results are issued tomorrow. Controversial: Universities are closing courses to Britons while offering places in clearing to overseas students who pay tuition fees of up to £20,000 a year. Manchester, pictured, is one of those taking advantage of the rules . Others will offer more places to non-EU candidates through clearing or allow them a wider choice of courses. Clearing vacancies for Scottish universities show that, in some subjects, places are available for overseas students on six times as many courses as for home students. Critics said sixth-formers would be frustrated to learn that many universities had the capacity to take extra students but were turning away well-qualified British applicants. The system will seem particularly unfair to pupils who do better than expected in their A-levels but cannot get into the university they wanted, even though it is still recruiting. Despite a decline in applications linked to new £9,000-a-year fees, university admissions are still competitive, and as many as 150,000 applicants this year will be unsuccessful. Universities which exceed recruitment targets for home and European Union students face heavy fines, but they can take as many non-EU students as their facilities will allow. With international students paying market rates for their degree courses, usually £10,000 to £20,000 a year, they are critical to the financial health of many universities. One university vice-chancellor yesterday called for the immediate scrapping of student number controls. Professor David Green, of Worcester University, said: ‘Other countries across the world, from China, to India, to Brazil to the US, realise that the best guarantee of a prosperous future is to have a more educated population, yet we are using these number controls, which is crazy.’ Clearing listings on the UCAS website show that places are available on 149 history courses for international students, but on only 24 for home/EU applicants. On its website, Edinburgh University (above), which wants to recruit an extra 100 international students this year, says it 'may have a small number of clearing vacancies available for well-qualified non-EU international UCAS applicants' Only universities in Scotland have posted their vacancies, since exam results north of the border are issued earlier than in England and Wales. On its website, Edinburgh, which wants to recruit an extra 100 international students this year, says it ‘may have a small number of clearing vacancies available for well-qualified non-EU international UCAS applicants. 'We will not have clearing vacancies for other applicants.’ UCAS even has two search facilities on its website – one for home/EU students and the other for international applicants. Of universities which responded to our survey, Manchester said it ‘may be the case where a course reaches the home target... places remain available for international students only’. Loughborough, Essex, Cardiff, Brunel and Queen Mary, University of London, all made similar comments.","Edinburgh, Manchester and Cardiff are .

Baroness Warsi has broken ranks on gay marriage to warn it could have a string of 'unintended consequences' The minister for faith has broken ranks on gay marriage to warn that David Cameron’s controversial legislation could have a string of ‘unintended consequences’. In a letter leaked to the Daily Mail, Baroness Warsi suggests schools could be required to teach about same-sex unions, while individual priests and churches who refuse to conduct them risk being sued. Her intervention will embolden more than 100 Tory MPs who are threatening to vote against the legislation in the New Year. Writing to Culture Secretary Maria Miller, who unveiled the planned legislation on Tuesday, Lady Warsi raises a series of questions about the change in the law. She demands ‘clarity’ on how the new law will properly ‘protect religious freedom’ and asks: ‘What legal support will be afforded to churches and other places of worship if they’re challenged individually or as an organisation?’ Lady Warsi, who attends Cabinet and is also senior minister for the Foreign Office, asks what legal advice the Government has received in relation to the compatibility of gay marriage legislation with ‘domestic and European law’. Most contentiously, the peer, who held talks on the issue this week with Church of England leaders, asks: ‘What consideration has been given to the teaching of equal marriage in schools, both faith schools and non-faith schools?’ Her letter, sent after Mrs Miller outlined her plans to MPs, was copied to Education Secretary Michael Gove, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, Attorney General Dominic Grieve and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles. The Cabinet signed off the plans this week, but Lady Warsi’s letter suggests that serious reservations – understood to be shared by other ministers, such as Environment Secretary Owen Paterson – remain. Lady Warsi tells Mrs Miller that as minister for faith she has received a ‘large volume of calls in relation to this matter’ from groups seeking assurance ‘about a number of aspects of the policy’. She writes: ‘How will we ensure that the legislation will protect religious freedom? What legal protection will churches and other places of worship be afforded from challenges if they refuse to undertake same-sex marriage? ‘What legal support will be afforded to churches and other places of worship if they’re challenged individually or as an organisation?’ Lady Warsi also reflects concerns that schools could be required to teach children about same-sex marriage. Under the Education Act 1996, pupils must learn about the nature of marriage and its importance for family life and the bringing up of children. Exchanges between Government officials released under freedom of information laws earlier this year suggested that if plans to allow gay couples to marry are passed into law, same-sex marriage might also have to be added to the sex education curriculum. In a letter leaked to the Daily Mail, Baroness Warsi suggests schools could be required to teach about same-sex unions, while individual priests and churches who refuse to conduct them risk being sued . But the Education Department has repeatedly insisted that teachers will still be able to refuse to teach anything considered inappropriate to the religious or cultural backgrounds of their pupils. Colin Hart, campaign director of the Coalition for Marriage, a campaign group opposing same-sex ceremonies, said: ‘Baroness Warsi is absolutely right when she highlights that the Government has failed to even pretend to try to protect teachers and other public sector workers from the effects of their gay marriage proposals. ‘Only a couple of weeks ago, an education minister admitted that the Government still hasn’t a clue on the effects of their policy on teachers, schools and parents who hold traditional views on marriage. How many more months do they need?’ Mrs Miller’s attempt to broker a compromise, by promising a special legal ban on gay marriages in the Church of England, appears to have satisfied no one. Under Government plans unveiled on Tuesday, religious same-sex marriages will be allowed in civil venues and places of worship that want to opt in. But, as an extra safeguard in what the Culture Secretary called a ‘quadruple lock’, the legislation will also outlaw any such ceremony in the Church of England and the Church in Wales. However the Archbishop of Wales Barry Morgan said: ‘In my personal opinion, it’s a great pity it’s illegal for us not to even have the possibility to do it. It should be left for us to opt in or opt out.’ And gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said banning the Church of England from performing same-sex marriages could breach of EU law. Lady Warsi's letter is understood to have caused irritation at the departments for culture and education, where officials have repeatedly brushed aside suggestions that legalising same-sex marriage could have implications for what is taught in the classroom. 'Sayeeda wading into this in this way after the policy has been agreed is very unhelpful,' said one Whitehall source. Lady Warsi refused to comment.","Letter leaked to Daily Mail reveals Baroness Warsi is breaking ranks .

The death of dashing Matthew Crawley broke the hearts of millions of Downton Abbey fans on Christmas Day. But Dan Stevens, the actor who played him, already has  his next job lined up – playing a Guardian journalist in a new Hollywood film about WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. He will appear alongside his friend Benedict Cumberbatch, of Sherlock fame, who has landed the lead role of the controversial whistleblower. Stevens, who is currently on Broadway in the play The Heiress, told The Mail on Sunday in New York that ‘we’re in negotiations’ about the movie. Assange had a turbulent relationship with The Guardian when they collaborated over the release of 250,000 secret US diplomatic cables last year. Stevens’s character, who is called Ian, is based on Guardian deputy editor Ian Katz. Steven Spielberg’s Dreamworks Studio, which is making the film, has struck a rights deal with The Guardian, although a spokesman insisted that neither Katz nor editor Alan Rusbridger had personally benefited from the arrangement. Filming will take place next year – at the same time as the fourth series of Downton is shot, which may explain why Stevens had to quit the ITV period drama. He has previously said:  ‘There are some very exciting opportunities. Downton was a very monopolising job. I haven’t done as many films as I would have liked.’ Swedish beauty Alicia Vikander, 24, has also signed up for the film, which may be called The Man Who Sold The World. It is not being made with the blessing of WikiLeaks. But the studio has bought up the rights to two biographies of Assange – one by former WikiLeaks spokesman Daniel Domscheit-Berg and another by Guardian journalists David Leigh and Luke Harding. The studio behind the film has bought the rights to two biographies of Julian Assange (pictured) who is currently hold up in the Ecuadorian embassy . Monopolising: Dan Stevens said that his role in Downton Abbey (cast pictured) did not allow him to do as many films as he would have liked . All of the authors have fallen out with Assange, who is currently holed up in Ecuadorian Embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden to face sexual assault charges. WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said: ‘If the film reflects what is written in those books, it will provide a negative view of WikiLeaks with limited impartiality. Hollywood is not exactly the best reflection of contemporary history. ‘I don’t believe WikiLeaks or Julian has been contacted by Dreamworks, but I don’t expect any courtesy from any organisation within Hollywood.’ Last year, at least five film versions of the WikiLeaks story were said to be in development. In the Downton Christmas episode she played Edna, a flirtatious housemaid whose clumsy attempt to seduce a topless Tom Branson, the former chauffeur who has married into the Crawley family, led to her being dismissed from service. But such antics are tame compared with what MyAnna Buring gets up to in BBC1 crime drama Ripper Street, which begins tonight. Set in 1889 in the aftermath of the Jack the Ripper murders, it stars the Swedish-born actress, 28 – who played a vampire in two of the Twilight films – as Long Susan, a feisty brothel-keeper who is on the run from the law in America. Scarlet woman: MyAnna Buring with Charlene McKenna (left) in Ripper Street . Clumsy: MyAnna Buring played Edna, a flirtatious housemaide whose attempt to seduce a topless Tom Brason, led to her being dismissed from service . Susan and her ex-lover Homer Jackson, a renegade former US Army surgeon (Adam Rothenberg), have  a tempestuous relationship  and are forever arguing. The situation isn’t helped by the fact that Jackson,  a drunk and a gambler, is now sleeping with Rose,  a prostitute played by Charlene McKenna. Viewers first see Buring’s character as she watches through a peephole as Jackson makes love to Rose. In another risque storyline, Jackson discovers Susan has hired out Rose to a man who may be a murderer. Downton Abbey will thrive despite the controversial death of Matthew Crawley, the show’s writer Julian Fellowes has insisted. Lord Fellowes said the character’s demise shortly after he had become a father would mean a pivotal role for his widow Lady Mary in the fourth series of the ITV drama next year. ‘Mary is back on her own, establishing her rights as the guardian of her baby son, fighting to get the estate through the dark days of the Twenties, struggling to re-find her own life,’ said Lord Fellowes.","He will star alongside Benedict Cumberbatch who will play the lead role .

Council bosses have been slammed for spending more than £4,000 on a two-day 'workshop' at an historic castle. A group of 26 senior Conservative councillors and officers from Surrey County Council attended the away day at the 900-year-old Farnham Castle.

Up to 650 people face losing their jobs at Surrey Country Council as the auhtority struggles to save £200m over the next four years due to government funding cuts. Lib Dem councillor John Orrick said: 'It's quite staggering when you look at the situation when they're about to put up council tax. Chief Executive of Surrey County Council David McNulty defended the trip saying it was 'value for money' 'There are any number of areas £4,000 could have been better spent. It just seems remarkably ill-conceived and short-sighted. 'It's not their money - they haven't had to earn it. We have a duty to provide excellent services and value, and to not do so is almost a dereliction of duty.' Chief executive of Surrey County Council, David McNulty, said the workshop, which took place on November 5 and 6, allowed the organisation to 'develop our approach on complex issues'. He said: 'I was at the workshop. I am . satisfied that it was the least expensive way of delivering the type of . workshop that was required. 'Intensive workshops with a very . focused agenda are a recognised way of enabling organisations to develop . their approach on complex issues. 'The scale of the challenges facing . us make it more important than ever that time is invested in ensuring we . have the most effective approach to delivering our growing . responsibilities. 'The ideas that came out of this very . intensive workshop are already delivering savings and benefits to . residents that go way beyond the cost of the workshop itself. 'I believe that councillors and staff . at Surrey County Council are continually focused on value for money, . which is why we have made such strong efficiency savings over recent . years.' Communities Secretary Eric Pickles recently published a paper called '50 Ways to save: Examples of Sensible Savings in Local Government', which puts at number 20 'Cancel away days at posh hotels'. It says: 'Use a council-owned property to hold any away day. Or borrow a room from a neighbouring council at no cost, and offer a free room to them for their away day.' The 12th century castle was built by the grandson of William the Conqueror and features a keep, a banqueting hall and historic gardens .

Jailed: Mohammed Prince Islam, 26, and a 16-year-old accomplice were captured on film as they used a crowbar to break in to the house in Southampton . Peering menacingly through the french doors, this is hooded burglar Mohammed Prince Islam preparing to break into a house. Seconds later he and a young accomplice used a crowbar to smash the glass and sneak inside. Then they helped themselves to householder Mark Avery’s Playstation, games and other goods worth a total of £800. The pair thought they were in the clear because they had spotted and disabled a security camera outside the three-bedroom house Mr Avery shares with his mother in Southampton. But unknown to them, 42-year-old Mr Avery had switched on his computer’s webcam before he and his mother left for work that morning, and the whole break-in was clearly captured. Mr Avery said: ‘As I was leaving I decided to switch it on. I don’t know what made me do it, I just had a bad feeling. ‘And I’m glad I did, it cost only about £40 but the quality of the images was pretty good.’ Mr Avery, who had installed CCTV outside his home after being burgled twice previously, turned the footage over to police and both intruders were charged with burglary. Despite the clear evidence, 26-year-old Islam protested his innocence at Southampton Crown Court in July. He was convicted and bailed but failed to turn up for the next hearing in August, so Mr Avery, a sales supervisor who was recently made redundant, stepped in again to bring the offender to justice. He said: ‘My friends and I had seen . him brazenly walking around town at least ten times and had reported the . sightings to the police. Nothing happened, it was very frustrating.

He was re-arrested and jailed for 30 months in December. Judge Peter Ralls QC heard that . Islam, from Harefield, near Southampton, was under a community order for . drugs offending when he broke into Mr Avery’s £200,000 home. The judge said: ‘This was a targeted attack. The victim had been subjected to two previous burglaries. ‘Burglary is always unpleasant for a . victim and I am satisfied this was deliberately carried out by you with . planning and organisation. An immediate custodial sentence is the only . appropriate penalty.’ Sarah Jones, mitigating, said Islam had not re-offended, had been working and intended to lead a law-abiding life from now on.

Furious: Sorina Howarth is calling for the baby food to be taken off the shelves after Adam nearly choked on an orange pip she believes came from the jar . A mother feared her baby son would die after he turned blue as he choked on an orange pip she claims was in his baby food. Sorina Howarth, 23, of Fulham, West London, has called for the food to be taken off the shelves, after doctors told her six-month-old Adam could have died if he was two months younger. She had to rush her son to hospital after he almost choked to death on the pip just four days before Christmas. Sorina, who is four and a half months pregnant, is now concerned because little Adam is too scared to eat solid food and has gone back to drinking milk. The incident happened at her mother-in-law's home when she was feeding Adam the HiPP Organic jar of mango and banana. The mother-of-two said: 'I was feeding Adam and the rest of the family were in the other room. 'He was eating quite a lot and at the end of the second jar he started to gag, which sometimes means he has had enough. 'He coughed and then really started to choke and I was crying because he was turning blue. 'We rushed him to hospital and I was trying to make him swallow. He wasn't crying, which really scared me. 'The hospital found an orange pip lodged in his throat - it was a really large one. 'When it was removed I was absolutely furious. 'The baby food is from four months plus and the hospital said if Adam had been that age, he would have choked to death. 'I thought he was going to die - I just couldn't believe it.' Mrs Howarth called the company the day after and told them she wanted the product, which she bought in a Boots store in Fulham Broadway, taken off the shelves. But she said when a courier showed up at her flat to pick up the jar, he left after she asked him for identification. Demands: Mrs Howarth called the company the day after the incident and told them she wanted the product taken off the shelves. She said: 'When I spoke to the company, they said it wasn't necessary to take it off the shelves because it is a freak incident. 'I wanted the pip sent recorded delivery so the company could determine if it came from them, and was told they would send a courier to pick it up for me. 'I was in the shower when he showed up and had to answer the door in my towel. I was absolutely fuming because he joked I shouldn't have got dressed up for him. Terrified: Mrs Howarth said she thought her son was going to die after he turned blue while choking on a pip, which she believes came from the jar of baby food . Mrs Howarth sought legal advice and was told she does have a case, but has to prove the pip came from a HiPP jar of baby food, and stump up the money for hefty legal fees. She has now sent the pip to the HiPP in the UK and says they are going to send it on to Germany. She said: 'I don't want to win money from them, I just want the food taken off the shelves in case something like this happens again.' Case: The 23-year-old mother-of-two, who is four months pregnant, has sought legal advice following the incident, but says she does not want money from the company . She said her husband Adam had been left furious following the incident. She said: 'We were both just so shocked and terrified because we thought he was going to die. 'He doesn't eat baby food anymore and will only drink milk otherwise he gags, which I think is a mental issue.

Sheila Quadrini, the ex-wife of millionaire businessman Michael Quadrini, was tied up and doused in petrol during an attack at her Newcastle home . A woman subjected to a terrifying raid in her home has told how she thought she would be burned alive after her attackers tied her up and doused her in petrol. Sheila Quadrini, the ex-wife of a nightclub tycoon, was held hostage for more than an hour at her house in Gosforth, Newcastle, as a gang ransacked her luxury detached home. The 65-year-old was tied up during her ordeal and managed to struggle to a phone and dial 999 with her tongue after her attackers left. Police are still appealing for information since the incident which happened on December 6 and no arrests have been made as yet. Ms Quadrini has only just returned to the house  - which has been her home for the past 11 years  - almost a month on from the raid. She said: 'It felt like it went on forever. 'When someone is constantly throwing petrol over you and asking you where the lighter is you think you're going to be killed. 'They were in the house a long time, but it felt like forever. I do feel lucky to be alive.' Ms Quadrini believes she was targeted in a planned attack as she arrived at her home after a day at work at around 6.30pm. While the grandmother was disabling her alarm, she felt a gloved hand reach behind her and cover her mouth. She was forced into her living room by one of the gang as another two ran upstairs and searched through her belongings for valuables. Ms Quadrini said: 'I think they were waiting for me. 'I have a regular routine so they must have known what time I would come home. 'It had to be planned, it can't have been an opportunist thing.They tied me up, poured petrol on me and ripped off the jewellery I was wearing. 'They kept asking me: 'Do you smoke?' Millionaire businessman Michael Quadrini, was a Newcastle nightclub tycoon . The tycoon owned the Tuxedo Princess floating nightclub in Gateshead along with a string of bars and restaurants . Mr Quadrini and his floating nightclub. His company Absolute Leisure was valued at £15million ten years ago but ran into financial trouble in 2009 . 'At the time I thought it was a stupid question, but they must have been looking for a lighter. 'One of them stayed with me the whole time. He was like a raving lunatic. He just kept saying: ""Where's the money, where's the money? 'He stayed with me constantly while the others went through everything.' Ms Quadrini's attackers eventually fled with cash and jewellery leaving her still tied up and terrified. She managed to free herself by struggling out of her Ugg boots which were bound with rope and with her hands still tied she made it to an upstairs phone and dialled 999 with her tongue. She said: 'I waited until I heard silence and there was nobody there. 'I got my boots off and I was free to go up the stairs. I went into this sort of panic because you don't know if they are going to come back at that point. 'I would never have believed them. But you just do anything you can to get out of the situation. 'When I heard a voice on the other end of the phone I was so relieved. I thought I had come through it.' Ms Quadrini, who works part time in an office, was too afraid to return home and has stayed with relatives since the raid. The mother-of-one says she suffers flashbacks of the attack and was left shaken. She said: 'I was in shock for a long while. I was in disbelief. 'For the first two weeks after it happened I felt like I was living in a nightmare. 'I had to have people doing everything for me. 'It took me more than a week to come back. I have had friends and family staying with me the whole time. During the horrifying raid at her home, raiders left her trussed up for over an hour until she managed to dial 999 using her tongue . 'I haven't been in the house by myself since. It was like the sort of thing you see on the television. 'The thing that stays with me the most is when I was at the front door and a hand came round my mouth.' Mr Quadrini, whose family still run nightclubs in Leeds, said: 'I didn't want to come back home. 'It just didn't feel like home anymore. It just makes you feel very cold. But it is just something you have got to conquer. 'You have just got to put your life back together. Sometimes you can have all the security in the world and it makes no difference. 'There are high hedges all round my house, but sometimes privacy can work against you.' A spokesman for Northumbria Police said: 'Enquiries into this incident are ongoing and we would appeal for anyone with information to come forward.' Ms Quadrini's ex-husband Michael operated the Tuxedo Princess nightclub in the 1980s. The Quadrini's have one son and divorced in 1985, but Sheila remained involved with the business.

Two thieves have become the first people in Britain to be handed ASBOs banning them from metal detecting. Peter Cox and Darren West were given the unique punishment after they looted ancient coins from a Roman site belonging to English Heritage. The pair were caught by police who raided their homes and found a haul of coins from the Iron Age, Roman and mediaeval periods worth hundred of pounds. ASBO: Peter Cox, left, and Darren West, right, have been banned from using metal detectors . Ransack: A piece of land at Chester Farm in Northamptonshire which was dug up by the two thieves . Officers also discovered pottery, metal antiquities and maps of Chester Farm, the Roman settlement near Irchester in Northamptonshire which the thieves ransacked. Cox, 69, and 51-year-old West were arrested in the summer when they were seen illegally digging trenches on the land. When police searched their homes in towns near the historic site, they were able to match the tools they recovered to plaster casts of marks left in the soil. Experts from the British Museum helped to analyse and date the recovered items, which have not been officially valued, and link them to the site. Investigation: Police took casts of the marks made by Cox and West's tools at the historic site . Cox and West pleaded guilty to two counts of theft from a scheduled monument on December 19. They were each given 52-week suspended sentences and were ordered to pay £750 costs and £750 compensation. The thieves were also issued with ASBOs preventing them from using metal detecting equipment. The coins they discovered at the site are similar to the massive haul of 50,000 Iron Age items found in Jersey last year, the largest hoard of Celtic coins ever unearthed. Historic: Chester Farm was an important settlement throughout the Iron Age, Roman and mediaeval periods . Under the law of treasure trove, metal detectorists who find items of historic significance must report their discoveries to the authorities. An inquest is then held to determine if the items should be declared treasure, in which case they must be offered for sale to a museum so they can be preserved for the nation. The proceeds from the sale are then shared between the person who discovered the items and the owner of the land where they were found. Among the best-known items to have been declared treasure is the Staffordshire Hoard, a collection of 1,500 Anglo-Saxon items made from gold and other precious metals which was found in 2009. Chester Farm is best known as a Roman town, showing evidence of houses, a cemetery and even a temple to the local Romano-Celtic gods. It also contains remains of an earlier Iron Age settlement, and was later the site of a mediaeval village. The area has frequently been the target of thieves in the past, and a 16th-century farmhouse on the site was attack by arsonists in 2010. After the hearing, Mike Harlow, governance and legal director of English Heritage, said: 'The sentence sets an important watershed in the combat against illegal metal detecting and acknowledges its true impact on society. 'These are not people enjoying a hobby or professionals carrying out a careful study. They are thieves using metal detectors like a burglar uses a jemmy. 'The material they are stealing belongs to the landowner and the history they are stealing belongs to all of us. 'Once the artefacts are removed from the ground and sold, the valuable knowledge they contain is lost for ever.' CPS East Midlands senior prosecutor Mark Holmes said: 'This case is the largest scale operation we have prosecuted for this type of crime. 'It should serve as a warning to anyone else involved in this activity that it is a crime and if you are caught you face prosecution and a criminal record.'","Peter Cox and Darren West handed suspended sentences for theft .

The family of locked-in syndrome sufferer Tony Nicklinson has won permission to continue his right-to-die campaign by appealing against a High Court ruling that went against him. Mr Nicklinson, 58, died a week after he lost his legal bid to end his life with a doctor’s help. The father-of-two had been refusing food and contracted pneumonia after he was left 'crestfallen' by the court’s decision. Widow Jane Nicklinson, wife of late right to die campaigner Tony Nicklinson, with her daughters Beth and Lauren at their home in Melksham, Wiltshire. They have won the right to die campaign by appealing against a High Court ruling that went against him . Tony Nicklinson's wife Jane comforts him as he reacts to a statement revealing High Court judges decided not to allow him to ask a doctor to end his life on August 16, 2012. Mr Nicklinson suffered from locked-in syndrome after suffering a stroke . He died at his home in Melksham, Wiltshire, surrounded by family on August 22 last year. The family vowed to continue Mr Nicklinson’s campaign, and today it was confirmed that the Court of Appeal has given permission for his widow Jane to bring an appeal against the High Court decision. The appeal is being seen as an important test case on whether medical help can legally be provided to those seeking the right to die. Mrs Nicklinson has said that continuing the legal battle is likely to involve a long campaign, fraught with legal technicalities, but the family sees it as 'part of Tony’s legacy, we’re fighting for him, on his behalf'. The family vowed to continue Mr Nicklinson's campaign. Today it was confirmed that the Court of Appeal has given permission for his widow Jane to bring an appeal against the High Court decision . Mr Nicklinson was a keen sportsman until he was paralysed by a stroke while on a business trip to Athens in 2005. Three judges sitting at the High Court in London referred to his 'terrible predicament' and described his case as ‘deeply moving and tragic’. But Lord Justice Toulson, Mr Justice Royce and Mrs Justice Macur unanimously agreed it would be wrong for the court to depart from the long-established legal position that 'voluntary euthanasia is murder, however understandable the motives may be.' They said doctors and solicitors who encouraged or assisted another person to commit suicide were 'at real risk of prosecution'. Refusing judicial review, the judges agreed that the current law did not breach human rights and it was for Parliament, not the courts, to decide whether it should be changed. Appeal judges will now have to decide whether or not they agree with the High Court’s stance. Mrs Nicklinson tweeted today: 'I have been granted the right to appeal the High Court decision that went against us. Good news indeed!' Mr Nicklinson’s daughter Lauren said: 'We are absolutely delighted and it is a great start to the year.'It was a great surprise to hear the news. 'Our legal team is behind us and believes we have every chance of succeeding.'We hope that 2013 brings greater things for our campaign than 2012.' But Campaign group Care Not Killing said the law, as upheld by the High Court, did not need changing or clarification. Group spokeswoman Alistair Thompson said 'no one could fail to be moved' by Mr Nicklinson’s case, but added: 'The current law has been debated and voted on many times by parliamentarians, and as recently as last year. 'It exists to protect those who are sick, elderly, depressed or disabled from feeling obliged to end their lives. 'It protects those who have no voice against exploitation and coercion and acts as a powerful deterrent to would-be abusers. It does not need changing.'","Mr Nicklinson, 58, died a week after he lost his legal bid to end his life .

Labour's tax credit system left behind a ‘sorry story of dependency, wasted taxpayers’ money and fraud’, Iain Duncan Smith said yesterday as the row over plans to cap payments intensified. The Work and Pensions Secretary launched an outspoken attack on the complex tax credit system devised by Gordon Brown, saying it had been ‘wide open to abuse’, including by foreign criminals. The TUC’s new general-secretary Frances O’Grady said Mr Duncan Smith’s comments marked the return of the ‘nasty party’, while Labour accused him of making a ‘cheap  political attack’ on a scheme relied on by almost six million families. Outspoken: Iain Duncan Smith (left) launched an attack on Gordon Brown's (right) complex tax credit system . But Mr Duncan Smith insisted the tax credit scheme was ‘not fit for purpose’. He accused Labour of deliberately extending the payments to more people in a bid to win votes – warning that the ballooning budget had helped bring the public finances to ‘breaking point’. He said: ‘In the years between 2003 and 2010, Labour spent a staggering £171 billion on tax credits, contributing to a 60 per cent rise in the welfare bill. ‘Far too much of that money was wasted, with fraud and error under Labour costing over £10 billion. Even for those in genuine need of support, tax credits were not fit for purpose. ‘The system was haemorrhaging money while at the same time trapping people in a system where those trying hard to increase the amount of hours they worked weren’t necessarily better off.’ George Osborne last month announced plans to cap increases in tax credits to just 1 per cent . Ministers admitted they did not know how many foreigners were claiming tax credits. Treasury minister David Gauke recently said ‘nationality is not a condition of entitlement’ and was therefore not recorded. The Coalition has disclosed that tax credits are paid to almost 6,000 children living abroad. But it does not know how much taxpayers’ money is being paid to foreign-based families, who are entitled to the British handouts under European law. George Osborne last month announced plans to cap increases in tax credits to just 1 per cent, in line with restrictions on other working age benefits.Ministers argue that the cap is fair, given the modest increases in wages in recent years. But Labour has accused ministers of imposing a ‘strivers’ tax’ which will hit millions of low-paid workers, as well as the unemployed. Tax credits have long been seen as a major source of fraud and error. Critics claim it would be much cheaper to tax people less in the first place rather than working out complex ways to hand them back part of the money. Payments are based on estimates of income  for the coming year, and after 2008 HMRC did not attempt to reclaim overpayments of less than £25,000. That is set to be reduced to £5,000 under the Coalition, alongside moves to require proof of payments from those claiming for childcare.","Said tax credit system devised by Gordon Brown was 'wide open to abuse'

Same-sex couples in Maryland were greeted with cheers at New Year's Eve parties, as gay marriage became legal in the first state south of the Mason-Dixon Line on January 1. James Scales, 68, was married to William Tasker, 60, on Tuesday shortly after midnight by Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake inside City Hall. 'It's just so hard to believe it's happening,' Mr Scales said shortly before marrying his partner of 35 years.

Forever love: James Scales, left, and William Tasker, who have been together for 35 years, kiss after getting married shortly after midnight on January 1 . Six other same-sex couples were being married at City Hall. Ceremonies were taking place in other parts of the state as well. The ceremonies follow a legislative fight that pitted Governor Martin O'Malley against leaders of his Catholic faith. Voters in the state, founded by Catholics in the 17th century, sealed the change by approving a November ballot question. 'There is no human institution more sacred than that of the one that you are about to form,' Rawlings-Blake said during the brief ceremony. 'True marriage, true marriage, is the dearest of all earthly relationships.' Overjoyed: Shehan Welihinda, left, and Ryan Wilson celebrate at City Hall in Baltimore after getting married . Brigitte Ronnett, who also was married, said she hopes one day to see full federal recognition of same-sex marriage. Maryland, Maine and Washington state were the first states to approve same-sex marriage by popular vote in November, a development Ms Ronnett said was significant. 'I think it's a great sign when you see that popular opinion is now in favor of this,' said Ronnett, 51, who married Lisa Walther, 51, at City Hall. Same-sex couples in Maryland have been able to get marriage licenses since Dec. 6, but they did not take effect until Tuesday. In 2011, same-sex marriage legislation passed in the state Senate but stalled in the House of Delegates. For better or worse: William Countryman, right, adjusts partner Roy Neal's tie before they tie the knot . O'Malley hadn't made the issue a key part of his 2011 legislative agenda, but indicated that summer that he was considering backing a measure similar to New York's law, which includes exemptions for religious organizations. Shortly after, Archbishop Edwin O'Brien of Baltimore wrote to O'Malley that same-sex marriage went against the governor's faith. 'As advocates for the truths we are compelled to uphold, we speak with equal intensity and urgency in opposition to your promoting a goal that so deeply conflicts with your faith, not to mention the best interests of our society,' wrote O'Brien, who served as archbishop of the nation's first diocese from October 2007 to August 2011. The governor was not persuaded. He held a news conference in July 2011 to announce that he would make same-sex marriage a priority in the 2012 legislative session. True love: Thomas Rabe, right, places a wedding ring on Robert Coffman's finger during their marriage ceremony shortly after midnight . Commitment: William Countryman, left, and Roy Neal exchange vows as officiant Jason Caton looks on . He wrote back to the archbishop that 'when shortcomings in our laws bring about a result that is unjust, I have a public obligation to try to change that injustice'. The measure, with exemptions for religious organizations that choose not to marry gay couples, passed the House of Delegates in February in a close vote. O'Malley signed it in March. Opponents then gathered enough signatures to put the bill to a statewide vote, and it passed with 52 percent in favor. In total, nine states and the District of Columbia have approved same-sex marriage. The other states are Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York and Vermont.

And it was all because of a mistake made by the Oireachtas when it prepared guidelines on expenses. Under the expenses regime in place in 2010, it was made specifically clear that travel claims covered only a TD’s constituency. However, when new booklets were prepared following the election of March 2011, the word ‘constituency’ had accidentally been omitted. Internal emails obtained by the Irish Mail on Sunday reveal how the error was only spotted after controversy arose over the Socialist TDs. Deputy Higgins had faced calls to pay back in excess of €1,000 while a number of other TDs including Ms Daly and Ms Collins also admitted they had used their expenses to pay for travel outside of their constituencies. An email from Oireachtas staff member Cliona O’Rourke outlined how the problem had only cropped up when a new travel and accommodation allowance was being introduced for politicians. It said: ‘As all legislation and regulations... had specified travel as constituency travel, the information booklet, issued to members in March 2010, specified that “other travel” was constituency travel. ‘However, subsequent booklets – including those that issued to the new members after the election quoted the regulation directly and referred to “travel expenses which the member is obliged to incur in the performance of his or her duties”. Pressure: TD Joan Collins, left, was told to pay back cash she had claimed while Joe Higgins, right, was furious at press coverage he described as 'malicious' ‘The fact that the regulation excluded the word “constituency” when referring to travel has, in our view, raised a legal issue which may have to be clarified by the Attorney General.’ Ms O’Rourke said the Oireachtas believed that their intention had been clear and that the payment was meant only to cover constituency travel. She said: ‘Notwithstanding that fact, however, the regulation does not specify that position exactly.’ The Houses of the Oireachtas then sought legal advice and were told the regulation did only cover constituency travel. They issued a press release saying so, heaping further pressure on the TDs involved to reimburse the money. Socialist Party TD Joe Higgins was furious and wrote to Minister Brendan Howlin saying he had been the victim of ‘malicious’ coverage in the press. He wrote: ‘It is not fair that certain media interests can use a lack of clarity to launch gratuitous and malicious attacks on [individuals] for their own reasons.’ Separately, however, the Oireachtas had also sought assistance from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, who asked the Attorney General Máire Whelan for her advice. The Department said Ms Whelan’s opinion was that the Oireachtas’ position was untenable because the word constituency was ‘not explicitly stated’. The Houses of the Oireachtas said that they had taken the view that non-constituency travel was already covered by the €41,000 ‘leader’s allowance’ that is paid to each Independent TD every year. The travel and accommodation allowance can be claimed by all TDs and ranges from €12,000 for Dublin-based politicians to €37,850 for those furthest away from the Dáil. The allowances are to be cut under changes announced by Minister Howlin in the Budget, with lower rates applying to Senators.","Word 'constituency' omitted from revised guidelines in 2011 .

"By . Amanda Williams . PUBLISHED: . 05:20 EST, 3 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:37 EST, 4 January 2013 . Myra Hindley admitted that she was even worse and more wicked than her fellow Moors Murderer Ian Brady, it has emerged today. She even spoke of her 'love' for children and desire to work with old people if she was ever released. The child-killer said she was more 'culpable' than her partner-in-crime because she knew better and 'knew the difference between right and wrong'. Hindley's astonishing confession has been uncovered as secret details about the killer's time in a Suffolk jail were today revealed in prison files. Self-improvement: Moors murderer Myra Hindley turned herself from a 'brassy blonde' to an 'intelligent, well-educated woman' and even earned an Open University degree, pictured right, new files have revealed . It sees new light shone on her . clandestine trips to the county's hospitals, and her last views on the . brutal pair's notorious killings. Evil: Ian Brady who killed five children with Myra Hindley between July 1963 and October 1965 . Hindley, branded the 'most . hated woman in Britain', was jailed for life in May 1966 for the . barbaric murders of Lesley Ann Downey, 10, and Edward Evans, 17. She was also an accessory to the horrific murder of John Kilbride, 12, by Brady. In 1987 Hindley and Brady confessed to murdering Pauline Reade, 16, and Keith Bennett, 12. Hindley, who was at Highpoint Prison at Stradishall, near Newmarket, from 1998, died in 2002 aged 60. Her confidential files were supposed to have remained secret for another 50 years. But, due to intense public interest, . they have been released to the national archives and are now being . studied and ordered by Dr Tom Clark, a lecturer at the University of . Sheffield. The typed reports, handwritten notes . and prison correspondence, which Dr Clark has been working on for three . years, give a unique snapshot of Hindley through the eyes of fellow . prisoners, welfare workers, warders and chaplains. And prison documents, which include a . final psychological assessment made in the months before her death, . carry blood-chilling accounts of how she felt about the Moors murders, . which horrified the nation. The interviews reveal that although . Hindley believed Brady initiated the killings her attitude towards . involvement shifted from 'one of fear to one of a willing participant . who enjoyed the feelings of affinity with Mr Brady which involvement in . the offences afforded her'. Hindley also suggests she recognises . her own culpability by stating: '...although by the end I had become as . corrupt as Ian was, there is a distinction...I did not instigate...but I . knew the difference between right and wrong...I didn't have a . compulsion to kill...I wasn't in charge...but in some ways I was more . culpable because I knew better.' Victims: Pauline Reade, 16, left, was their first victim and John Kilbride was killed in 1963 . Murdered: Lesley Ann Downey, 10, left, and Edward Evans, 17, right . Twelve-year-old Keith Benett was abducted on his way to visit his grandmother in Manchester on 16 June 1964. His body has never been found . The document reports that Hindley was 'extremely tearful' as she stated 'I've affected so many people.' She said that coverage of the Soham . murders in August 2002 - when Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells, both 10, . were murdered by Ian Huntley  - had brought back 'painful memories.' Hindley added: 'I can see how the public perceive my offences since the Cambridge offences.' During the interviews her lack of . mobility is also noted, with the claim that her ability to 'engage in . direct physically aggressive acts' is reduced. Hindley, who was described in other . documents at the time as 'generally cheerful' and even 'houseproud', . appeared to be content with 'unofficial segregation' in her single room . at Highpoint. She states: 'I would like to stay . here...peace of mind...good staff...appreciation of mum's needs...told . may move to Foston Hall (in Derbyshire)...I do not want to go . there...too far for visits....prefer to stay here at Highpoint.' 'I've made my funeral arrangements for here in case I die in prison,' said Hindley. But the Roman Catholic convert still . hoped she would be released from prison to spend time with her family, . despite what she admitted was 'the real threat of assassination'. Hindley added: 'I would like to work . with old people...know I can~t work with children...but love . children...would like to be of some help to older people.' The documents, which include letters . to then Home Secretary Jack Straw, also chart Hindley's ailing health . and top-secret operations to take her to West Suffolk Hospital, Bury St . Edmunds, and Addenbrooke's, Cambridge. Letters dated December 21, 1999, and . addressed to senior members of the prison service, said Hindley would be . attending West Suffolk Hospital on December 30 as an in-patient for . between two and five days after suffering 'ill-health for some time'. Jailed: Hindley was put in charge of the kitchen on E wing at Holloway Prison in North London and died in 2002 at Highpoint Prison, Suffolk . The letter goes on to say that the . visit could not be 'out and back' because the 'media are on the scent' and the savage multiple child-killer was more at risk of an attack than . she was likely to escape. An accompanying document said Hindley . should be cuffed when travelling to the hospital and on a closeting . chain when moving from her bed 'mainly to prevent abduction, though . there is always a possibility of her attempting to escape'. The report, which stressed that . Hindley could not be relied upon to keep arrangements secret, added: 'It . is probably fair to say that neither she nor the staff who care for her . here have much real idea of the true risks of her visit to hospital.' Hindley suffered ill-health throughout . her 36 years in jail and suffered from the heart condition angina, high . blood pressure and brittle bone disease osteoporosis. Although the exact reason for her . visit to West Suffolk Hospital is not contained in documents seen, she . is known to have had heart scans and suffered a stroke while at . Highpoint - attributed to her heavy smoking - in January 2000. One document in the archive gives . details of 'Operation Charlton', the pre-planned admission of Hindley . into Addenbrooke's on January 13, 2000. The exercise was named after Hindley's . pseudonym, Christine Charlton, which was used at all times when . communicating with the hospital. The document, which includes the exact . route into the hospital, also explains how the prisoner should be . guarded by officers in civilian clothing. Hindley died in West Suffolk Hospital . in November 2002 from a serious chest infection that followed a . suspected heart attack two weeks before. She received the last rites from a Catholic priest.","Prison papers about Myra Hindley released early to national archives .

The club's own boats were unable to help as a result of the number of dinghies needing assistance and the rough weather. They notified the Humber Coastguard who asked Sunderland RNLI to launch its inshore lifeboats, Wolseley and MyJo. A Coastguard rescue team from Sunderland was also tasked to attend the incident to liaise directly with yacht club staff. Paul Nicholson, Senior Helmsman at Sunderland RNLI, said: ‘After launching we immediately made contact with the yacht club's safety boat crews to establish the whereabouts of each of the dinghies. ‘It was quickly confirmed that all dinghies were accounted for, but some needed assisting to the shore due to the poor weather conditions.’ One teenager was put on board a lifeboat and carried ashore after reporting pains in her shoulder. After a full check-up at the lifeboat station, she was allowed home, with no further medical treatment required. The two lifeboats helped all 11 dinghies to shore. Mr Nicholson said: ‘We regularly work with the yacht club to make sure we can work hand in hand with their own safety boat crews should an incident like this happen. ‘This meant that what could have been a very difficult incident to deal with went like clockwork. ‘It is important for all sailing clubs to have well-practised emergency plans to ensure that any escalating incident can be dealt with effectively.’ Water fun thing: A man and child on the seafront at Seaham as a giant wave hits the sea wall .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 17:53 EST, 31 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:18 EST, 1 January 2013 . Muhammed Rahim al-Afghani, who is being held with the most significant terrorism suspects in U.S. custody, has apparently gained extensive knowledge of western pop culture in Guantanamo's Camp 7 . An inmate who is imprisoned alongside 'high value' terrorism suspects in the most secretive of Guantanamo Bay camps has somehow learned about Gangnam Style, his lawyer has revealed. Mohammed Rahim al-Afghani, an Afghan man who became the last prisoner sent to Guantanamo after he was accused of helping Osama bin Laden elude capture five years ago, has written a series of letters to lawyer Carlos Warner, revealing a startling knowledge about western culture. Across the letters, he refers to Howard Stern, Fox News and the global video hit of South Korean singer PSY - hardly what you'd expect from a middle-age Afghan who has never been to the U.S. 'Dear Mr. Warner,' he wrote. 'I like . this new song Gangnam Style. I want to do the dance for you but cannot . because of my shackles.' In another letter, the multilingual Rahim . shows some familiarity with American slang. He tells his lawyer, most . likely in jest, that he has adopted a banana rat, a rodent commonly . spotted around the U.S. base in Cuba. 'Tell the guards to leave my . friend alone. They need to chillax.' South Korean rapper Psy has become a global phenomenon with his signature song and dance, 'Gangnam Style' The letters come as a surprise as little has been heard about Rahim since his capture. He was interrogated at an undisclosed location then locked away in Guantanamo's Camp 7, a  prison unit shrouded in secrecy that holds about 15 men who have been designated 'high value' detainees. The letters suggest that the prisoners in Camp 7, a group that includes five charged with aiding and orchestrating the September 11 terror attack, are not completely isolated from the outside world. To Warner, a federal public defender for the Northern District of Ohio, the letters humanize a man who he contends has been demonized by U.S. authorities, who allege he worked as a translator and assistant to bin Laden and other al-Qaida leaders. The lawyer says the letters demonstrate a surprising amount of resilience. 'It shows he's different and he's intelligent,' Warner said. 'Just think that he's doing this under all the restrictions that's he's under down there. He has an incredibly good sense of humor.' There have been letters released to the media in the past from other detainees at Guantanamo, often providing valuable information about the prison. Muhammed Rahim al-Afghan said that he cannot do Psy's signature moves because of his shackles . The Justice Department document says Rahim began helping the Taliban in the 1990s and that job morphed into working for al-Qaida. It cites two other prisoners and an undisclosed source identifying Rahim as a close associate of bin Laden. Rahim was captured in Pakistan in 2007 and turned over to the CIA, in whose custody he was subjected to prolonged sleep deprivation. He was transferred to Guantanamo in March 2008. In photos taken by the Red Cross at Camp 7, and obtained by the AP from the prisoner's family in Afghanistan, Rahim has a long flowing beard. In one, he smiles broadly at the camera. It is unclear how the prisoner learned so much of Western pop culture from Cell 7 in Guantanamo, located in Cuba . The first letters from Rahim released by Warner were in June, including one in which he disclosed that Majid Khan, a former Maryland resident who pleaded guilty to aiding al-Qaida, had acquired a cat at Camp 7, which AP reported at the time. The Pentagon and prison officials declined comment and said they could not discuss conditions of confinement for high-value detainees, although they added that prisoners are not permitted to have pets. Rahim al-Afghan was accused of helping the late Osama bin Laden go into hiding; here, bin Laden's house in Abbottabad, Pakistan . The rest of the letters came during or after subsequent visits by Warner, who had them cleared by the military before releasing them to the AP. None are more than a few sentences, and contain many typographical errors, which have been corrected for this story for the sake of clarity. In one, Rahim returns to the theme of his fellow prisoner's alleged cat. 'I want a dog,' he writes. 'I will train my dog to chase Majid Khan's cat.' Osama bin Laden was killed in his home on May 1, 2011 . In separate notes, he asks Warner to appeal for help from radio personality Howard Stern. 'If he is the 'King of All Media' he can help me.' In another, he criticizes Fox News' 'Fair and Balanced' slogan, writing that if that were true the channel 'would not have to say it every five minutes.' How he came by this information is not clear. A prison spokesman, Navy Capt. Robert Durand, won't discuss life in Camp 7 but he says that ""where satellite television and radio is available for detainees,"" they have access to a wide variety of channels in Arabic, Farsi, English, Russian, Spanish and other languages. The line-up, however, apparently does not include Howard Stern or Fox. With no Internet access, he could have picked up such information from other shows or through Warner, who has spent hours with him and delivered magazines such as Rolling Stone, Sports Illustrated and The Economist. The U.S. military will not say when or if Rahim will be charged. His name does not appear on the list of detainees who have been cleared for release from Guantanamo and his name was not among those mentioned as possible candidates for an exchange with the Taliban as part of a peace deal.","Mohammed Rahim al-Afghani accused of helping Osama bin Laden elude capture and sent to Camp 7 of high-security Cuban prison .

A company that runs a reward scheme to boost children’s behaviour by giving them iPods and cinema tickets is being scrutinised by the gambling watchdog for allegedly running an illegal lottery. Vivo Miles, the profit-making company which runs the scheme in hundreds of schools that allows pupils to amass points for good conduct that they cash in for products, began selling raffle tickets with prizes, including £300 iPads, in November. One parent was so alarmed her seven-year-old son had entered a raffle she complained to the Gambling Commission, saying it was illegal for under-16s to buy such tickets. Investigation: Vivo Miles is a profit-making company . which runs a scheme in hundreds of schools that allows pupils to amass . points for good conduct that they cash in for products . The Commission refused to comment on individual cases but said: ‘We take any complaint regarding children and gambling seriously.’ Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers union, said running a lottery  for children ‘sent out the  wrong message’. Vivo Miles’s managing director Adrian Burt said the raffles were a ‘trial’ that had been suspended and proceeds would go to charity. Nearly 500 secondary schools, one in six, are signed up to the company's reward scheme, which is intended to replace old-style rewards such as stickers, gold stars and house points. But the extent of incentives being offered in schools brought a warning last year that a generation of children is growing up expecting to be rewarded at every stage.

The Vivo Miles system is designed to mimic a bank account, with Vivos the currency or ‘payment’ for hard work at school. The card is meant to be similar to a bank debit card and comes with a PIN which pupils use to check their points balance. The team behind Vivo Miles says it teaches children personal finance lessons such as the importance of saving. But Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said the scheme amounts to ‘bribery’. ‘It misleads children into thinking anything which requires effort has to have a special reward,’ he said. ‘It takes away the incentive offered by education as an end in itself.","The company called Vivo Miles began selling .

An over-the-top instructional video has been released from a Homeland Security department on what to do if you are caught up in a mass shooting. The six-minute tape, complete with pulsating soundtrack and blood spatter, advises that the best way to survive is follow three steps - run, hide or as a last resort, fight. The clip was produced by the Houston Police Department in Alabama and published on November 5 by the state's Homeland Security department. It depicts the nightmare which unfolds as a sole gunman stalks employees in an office building. Scroll down for video . Taking a stand: Although the video advises to run or hide from a gunman first, it then suggests with this dramatic scene that you fight - as these 'employees' do with a fire hydrant, chair, coffee pot and belt . Fear strikes: The instructional video from the Department of Homeland security in Alabama shows what to do if a gunman opens fire in a public space, like this office . Run for your life: The video first suggests that if you can escape the shooting you should do so but not to let colleagues 'slow you down' The melodramatic video has attracted a flurry of comments on YouTube about gun control and a variety of survival tips. As the clip begins, a voice-over says: 'It may feel like another day at the office but occasionally, life feels like an action movie.' The camera then cuts between office workers happily chatting, working at their desks and answering phones to a man dressed in black, wearing sunglasses and carrying a backpack. The voice reminds members of the public: 'You have to be prepared for the worst.' The graphic content then shows the man in black removing a shotgun from his backpack and opening fire on a crowded reception area as employees drop to the ground, blood spraying across walls and people running away screaming. Desperate: An employee who escaped the building pleads with a passer-by for the use of his phone in the clip . Turn out the lights: One woman hides in the dark behind the photocopier as a shooter roams the halls in the safety video . Terror: The gunman tries doors in the office building as employees hide . The voice-over continues: 'If you are ever to find yourself in the middle of an active shooter event, your survival may depend on whether or not you have a plan.' The Homeland Security video suggests that there are three options for those caught up in the terrifying situation - run, hide, fight. The clip then shows several employees darting between office cubicles to find an escape route. However, the video reminds the public that although they should help others - 'don't let them slow you down with indecision'. Back in the building, other employees crouch behind tables and photocopiers, locking doors and turning off lights as screams and gunshots ring out. Hysteria: An actress weeps in the gun safety video for the Alabama Homeland Security Department . Flee: Actors playing office workers made a dramatic bid for freedom in the video . Drama unfolds: Employees gather in front of a fire truck following their terrifying ordeal . In . the final scene, a group of trapped employees decide to 'fight' as one . woman cries hysterically. The others arm themselves with a chair, fire . hydrant, coffee pot and leather belt as the gunman bursts in. At the end of the instructional video, shaken employees gather around a fire truck as the life-saving instructions flash across the screen once more. The video, which appears on Alabama's Department of Homeland Security website, was posted on YouTube on November 5. It comes with the disclaimer: 'An individual must use his/her own discretion during an active shooter event as to whether he/she chooses to run to safety or remain in place.' There has been a spate of deadly shootings across the U.S. this year culminating in the tragedy at Sandy Hook elementary school on December 14 where 20 children and six teaching staff were killed. To the rescue: Armed police arrive at the end of the safety video . Three life-saving steps: The video, made by Houston police department in Alabama, first advises those caught up in a shooting to flee . Follow orders: The second piece of advice, if you can't escape, is to keep out of sight . Last resort: If there is no other possibility, the department of Homeland Security suggests you commit to fighting the gunman .","Video was posted by Alabama Homeland Security on November 5, 2012 .

Towns and cities across Britain are drowning under mountainous piles of Christmas and New Year rubbish as some homes have not had refuse collections for up to three weeks. Bins are overflowing and streets strewn with boxes and black bags in a situation householders say is posing a health risk. Photographs taken today show roads in Bristol, Birmingham and Edinburgh all submerged in rubbish, strengthening the Government's argument that every home in Britain should have its waste collected weekly. Edinburgh: The bags and boxes of waste from the Christmas and New Year celebrations are growing . Birmingham: Some homes in this city have not had refuse collections for three weeks . Bristol: Detritus is piled outside some homes in the city in an image mirrored all over Britain . Councils have today been accused of being irresponsible as some cancelled collections over Christmas and the New Year to give their staff time off. As a result, to rectify the current chaotic situation, some have had to put on emergency collections to placate hopping-mad households. Furious residents living in the Harborne area of Birminham  - where house prices top £400,000 - expressed dismay as their bins have not been collected since December 16. While residents living in well-heeled Carless Avenue, accused Birmingham City Council of abandoning frontline services. The streets are paved with overflowing bins and piles of litter in the Levenshulme area of Manchester . Homes in Brighton face out onto roads lined with bin bags full of rotting rubbish, as the remnants of the holidays are yet to be cleared away . One homeowner said: 'It's shocking, really, you open your door and you're met with this sea of waste. 'It's really starting to smell a bit and I worry that the longer it's left there the more of a risk it will pose to families and their children. 'I appreciate that everyone needs some time off over Christmas but I don't know many people that get a three-week break. 'The council should have foreseen the inevitable problems of cancelling collections over Christmas when, traditionally, households accumulate even more rubbish.' Chaos: More than a dozen black bags full of rubbish forms a mountain of waste in Birmingham . The party is over: As Edinburgh starts 2013 the bottles and waste of the New Year celebrations are bagged up and waiting to be taken away from businesses on George IV Bridge . Dirty: Piles of rubbish litter Carlton Road in Birmingham where household waste in the area has not been collected since the Wednesday before Christmas . Stinky: Food, card and paper are left waiting for collection on this Bristol street . One large semi-detached house could not be seen at all from the road as black bin bags were piled high on the clipped grass verges. Meanwhile residents in nearby Bordesley Green battled their way through ankle-deep filth yesterday after strong winds caused dozens of bin bags to split, sending waste spilling across the pavement. The situation became so bad over Christmas that the council had to make an emergency collection due to the volume of complaints from locals. Messy: Litter is strewn all over this road in Birmingham, not helped because Britain has been battered by storms in recent weeks . Pile: Edinburgh is still recovering from its busy and legendary Christmas and New Year celebrations . Pensioner Pat Clarke, 68, said that the build-up of refuse has created a health hazard for her and other older residents. She said: 'I'm registered disabled and on crutches so it's a real nightmare when I go out there. 'There are lots of polythene bottles and if they get wet they become very slippery and if I accidentally put my crutch on one that's it and I go over. 'We haven't had any notification from the council about the changes - in previous years I've had a note through the door but I got nothing this year. 'I only knew they were coming when a neighbour phoned me to let me know.' Surrounded: Piles of rubbish litter surround this large tree in Crarless Avenue Birmingham . Waiting: The typical waste left from a good Christmas remains uncollected outside homes across Britain . Queue: This long line of bags is one of many dotted across the UK waiting to be picked up . A Birmingham City Council spokesperson . said: 'As is the case every year, there are some planned changes to the . refuse collection service over Christmas and New Year. 'This year there were no collections . scheduled on Christmas Day or Boxing Day, and this was widely publicised . well in advance of the festive period.

At least half the homes in Britain - 10million households covered by 180 local authorities - have lost their weekly collections and now have general rubbish taken away only once every two weeks. Rubbish dump: Birmingham council says they widely publicised the fact that collections would not be made over Christmas . Residents have been 'shocked' that the council did not provide a Christmas rubbish collection . The politician said in his vow to bring back weekly collections: 'I believe it’s a fundamental right for every Englishman and woman to be able to put the remnants of their chicken tikka masala in their bin without having to wait two weeks for it to be collected.' Once-a-week household rubbish collections came into law in 1875 to stamp out cholera and other plagues which claimed huge numbers of lives. They were maintained until after Labour’s 1997 election victory, when local authorities were encouraged to collect household waste and recyclable rubbish on alternate weeks.

More than 3,000 rejected gifts from ex-partners, mother-in-laws, and other relatives have been listed on eBay since Christmas.

An American Airlines flight from Brazil to Dallas was diverted to Houston on Wednesday after a 25-year-old passenger became ill and died aboard the aircraft, it was revealed today. Airport officials summoned homicide detectives to George Bush Intercontinental Airport just before dawn after learning that American Flight 962 was coming to Houston because of a medical emergency involving a passenger. The passenger, who was revealed to be Brazilian, was declared dead after the plane landed, authorities said. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: A 25-year-old woman became ill and died on a flight between Brazil and Dallas (stock photo) ‘There was no sign of trauma,’ and no foul play is suspected, Houston police spokeswoman Jodi Silva said. An autopsy will be done, she said. The name of the Brazilian passenger wasn’t immediately released, and American Airlines spokesman Matt Miller told MailOnline that the airline was unable to provide any further information about her. According to authorities, the Boeing 777 left Sao Paolo, Brazil, at 1:12 am with 220 passengers and a crew of 14 bound for Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. When the woman went into medical distress, the flight crew, along with a doctor who happened to be on board, began performing emergency procedures, and the plane was diverted to Houston. The plane landed in Houston at 6:34 a.m., left the city about 2½ hours later, and finally arrived in Dallas at 10:25am. An autopsy will be performed on the woman to discover the cause of her death, KTRK reported. Federal law requires a defibrillator on every flight with a maximum payload capacity of 7,500 pounds, a rule that covers major airliners, Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Laura Brown told the Associated Press. Diversion: The flight was diverted to the George Bush Houston airport . It also requires flight attendants to have CPR and defibrillator training at least once every two years. American Airlines flight 962 Wednesday from Sao Paolo (GRU) to Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) diverted to Houston (IAH) because of a medical emergency. AA962 departed GRU at 1:12 a.m. and diverted to IAH at 6:34 a.m. It left IAH at 9:05 a.m. and landed at DFW at 10:25 a.m. It was a Boeing 777 with 220 passengers and a crew of 14. Miller said every American flight has an extensive medical kit and an automated external defibrillator. Flight attendants must complete annual CPR and medical training approved by the FAA, he said. In addition, American is one of the few airlines with trained medical professionals on staff, Miller said. Doctors are on call 24 hours a day and available to work with flight crews. While on-board deaths are not unheard of, it’s not clear how many there are. The FAA does not keep track, Brown said. A Vanderbilt University study published in 2003 based on a review of an unidentified major airline showed 1.52 ‘medical diversions’ for every billion passenger miles flown. Another study published the same year from George Washington University put the number of deaths at one unidentified airline for all of 1999 at 0.1 per million passengers. http://eriebasin.com/a_blackopaldeco1012.html .","Brazilian national, 25, died on American Airlines flight from Brazil to Dallas-Fort Worth .

Controversial Queens Park Rangers footballer Joey Barton was burgled as he celebrated his son’s first birthday, it emerged today. The £80,000-a-week midfielder, who is currently on loan at Olympique Marseille in France’s Ligue 1, was hosting an animal-themed party for his son Cassius near the home of his partner’s mother. Barton, 30, and his partner Georgia McNeil, 25, were staying at the house of Denise McNeil, 52, in West Derby, Liverpool, for Christmas - but the thieves struck while the home was empty. Couple: Joey Barton (left), 30, and his partner Georgia McNeil (right), 25, were staying at the house of Denise McNeil, 52, in West Derby, Liverpool, for Christmas - but the thieves struck while the home was empty . They smashed windows to gain entry on the night of last Friday and broke Cassius’s toys he had just received for Christmas while they hunted for jewellery and money, reported The Sun. The burglars got away with a family safe and were said to be confident the act would go without a hitch because Barton was tweeting pictures from the party around 15 minutes’ drive away. ‘Joey had been staying over Christmas and it’s likely the thieves knew he was there,’ a source told the Sun last night. ‘He was tweeting pictures from the party while the robbery was in progress.’ Barton tweeted at 2:24pm last Friday: 'Littleman's 1st birthday today. That year has flown. Happy 30th to @taggerdutaggerr (Andy Taylor) as well. Made up your business partners coming to c u!’ Celebration: Joey Barton posted this photo of his son's first birthday cake on Twitter, hours before the burglary . He later posted two pictures at 6:56pm, with one showing a picture of three men wearing animal fancy dress - and another of a blue birthday cake for Cassius with a lion and two monkeys on top. More than a third of Britons have publicised that their property is empty by sharing their whereabouts on social media, a survey said. And almost 30 per cent of people regularly leave their home unsecured while popping out - with windows open and doors unlocked, the poll by insurers Quotemehappy.com revealed. Meanwhile more than three quarters of people in Britain regularly leave their property vacant without an active burglar alarm, it found. The company's trading director Henry Topham: ‘Many homeowners are leaving tell-tale signs that they’re away and their house is empty, making it even easier for burglars to strike.’ A Merseyside Police spokesman said today: ‘We can confirm we had a report of burglary in the early hours of the 29th of December. Nobody was in at the time. ‘It would appear that a safe containing jewellery, documents and cash was stolen. The only damage to the house that we could see was caused by it being broken into and there is no indication of any other damage.’ Barton has not yet commented on the burglary, but said on Twitter on New Year's Eve: 'Got to stop as my son is now starting to copy things/noises people say. #nomoreswearing' Marseille currently sit third in Ligue 1, and Barton has played 12 games on loan from the Premier League side - seven of which were in the league - scoring one goal and accumulating three yellow cards. Last week it was revealed he could stay . at the French side for longer than his 12-month loan as it is understood . QPR chiefs have encouraged him to terminate his contract by mutual . consent. Prolific tweeter: Barton mentioned that it was his son's first birthday on the afternoon of last Friday . Barton, a former Manchester City and Newcastle United player, arrived at Marseille last August after being banned for 12 matches in May for violent conduct when he was sent off in a fiery match. The player - also fined £75,000 by the Football Association - elbowed Manchester City player Carlos Tevez, kicked Sergio Aguero and then aimed a head-butt at Vincent Kompany in disgraceful scenes. Barton admitted last November that the money on offer at QPR persuaded him to join in August 2011, saying: ‘I did it because my partner was due to give birth - but I did not feel good about it.’ He developed a track record of violent . conduct after inciting a 10-man brawl when Manchester City faced . Doncaster Rovers in a pre-season friendly in July 2004 following a bad . challenge on a player. On loan: Marseille's Joey Barton seen during their Ligue 1 football match against Saint-Etienne on December 23 . In December 2004 he stubbed a lit cigar into the eye of a City player at the club’s Christmas party and was sent home from a pre-season tour of Thailand in June 2005 after a brawl in the team hotel. In May 2007 he assaulted another City teammate during training and in December 2007 attacked a 16-year-old boy near a Liverpool McDonald's after binge-drinking. He was later jailed for six months. But on a lighter note, he was ridiculed last November for conducting an interview in English with a bizarre French accent reminiscent of 'Allo 'Allo! after making his loan league debut for Marseille.

A girl left severely disabled at birth is being forced to fly to the other side of the world every month in a 'soul destroying' journey to qualify for medical compensation. Paige Carpenter was born in New Zealand 14 years ago but suffered horrific brain damage when she was starved of oxygen. The authorities ruled that mistakes made by a midwife were to blame and Paige was handed a massive payout package to provide care for the rest of her life. Paige Carpenter, pictured right with her mother Donna, has to fly to the other side of the world to qualify for her medical compensation . When her English mother Donna decided to return home to live in the UK in June 2010 the compensation money was halted. But Mrs Carpenter found a loophole in the legislation which means so long as Paige is present in New Zealand for just 24 hours once a month she still qualifies for the £1,000-per week compensation. Payments started in Jan 2011 as soon as they landed . Paige has now endured 11 round-the-world trips of 23,000 miles from her home in Great Bentley, Essex - the equivalent of flying further than the Moon which is 238,855 miles away. Amazingly, when the teenager, her mother and her mother's partner land - they are automatically registered as having been in the country - meaning they often return after just one night's stay at an airport hotel. Sadly nearly all of the money, which should be for wheelchair bound Paige's medical care, is instead spent on air fares and travel costs. Donna, 43, and her husband, Stephen Barnett, 47, have to accompany the teenager on the exhausting trips which often involve a journey time of up to 40 hours to get out there. Paige Carpenter, now 14, with her mother Donna Carpenter (left) when she was born and (right) Paige when she was three . Paige Carpenter pictured after having undergone surgery for an E.Coli infection when she was five . But Mrs Carpenter is determined to continue with the journeys in a bid to highlight Paige's plight and force the authorities in New Zealand to back down and just make the compensation payments without the gruelling condition attached. She said: 'Paige did not ask for this life and all this is about is giving her the care she so desperately needs. 'It's not so that we can be wealthy - we are not living a life of luxury from this money - it's about providing round-the-clock care for her.' Paige's conditions mean she is wheelchair-bound and she is only able to speak a handful of words. Mrs Carpenter - a former shop manager - is now Paige's full-time carer. She added: 'I don't know how long we are . going to be able to carry on doing the trips - they are soul destroying. I am in tears every time we get onto the plane. Paige has now endured 11 round-the-world trips of 23,000 miles from her home in Great Bentley, Essex . 'We have to have Paige lying across our laps because she is not able to sit upright. 'I was ready to quit after the first few journeys we made but Paige's brothers and sisters encouraged me to carry on, reminding me that we are doing this for her future, hopefully so she will still be provided for in years to come when we are no longer alive.' Financial support is restricted for people once they leave New Zealand, meaning the only way that Paige can get her full entitlement is by moving back out there. Mrs Carpenter, a mother of six, said: 'It is heart-wrenching for us. Paige needs 24/7 care and it is very difficult. 'We really do want to get the best care we can for her and improve the quality of her life but they are making it extremely difficult. 'Why should we have to be living in New Zealand in order to get the money she is entitled to? All of our support network is now here in England and moving back to New Zealand is simply not an option.' Paige was born at home in New Zealand but suffered perinatal hypoxia - meaning her brain was starved of oxygen at the critical time. The teenager, who can barely speak, also suffers from cerebral palsy and has a twisted spine. Mrs Carpenter hopes one day to be able to take her daughter to America for an operation to straighten it and relieve the pain she constantly suffers. The mother-of-six says she has been constantly having to battle the authorities in order to get the compensation Paige is due. She added: 'She is a fighter, so I am going to keep fighting for her. We were told she would never speak, but she recently started to say a few words. 'When she said 'mummy, I love you' it was one of the happiest moments in my whole life.' Mrs Carpenter has five other children - Lauren, 21, Tyler, 19, Madison, 16, Jake, 11 and Aiden, seven. Lauren takes responsibility for looking after her younger siblings when her mother and husband, a carpenter, head to New Zealand. The compensation money - to provide 'attendant care' stopped in July 2011 and Mrs Carpenter's New Zealand lawyer argued there was 'no logical reason' why Paige should not receive the same payment in the UK but the case was dismissed. A spokesman for New Zealand's Accident Compensation Commission said he was unable to comment on individual cases. He said: 'We provide a range of support for people with accident-related injuries. However, the Accident Compensation Act restricts the support to clients once they leave New Zealand.' There is discretion for the ACC to fund people living overseas, but factors such as cost and whether the care can be monitored are taken into account.","Paige Carpenter was starved of oxygen at birth in New Zealand .

A benefits cheat who claimed to be partially blind and disabled faces jail after being caught driving. Kelvin Kalloo, of Dunstable, Bedfordshire, claimed nearly £100,000 in handouts from Brent Council and Central Bedfordshire Council over six years before being caught by the authorities' investigators. The married 34-year-old was caught out after being spotted driving three different cars and working no a market stall in Watford, Hertfordshire, jurors at Harrow Crown Court were told last month. Benefit cheat: Kelvin Kalloo, of Dunstable, Bedfordshire, claimed nearly £100,000 in handouts from Brent Council and Central Bedfordshire Council over six years before being snared by the authorities' investigators . Kalloo told both councils he was partially blind and a car crash left him unable to walk unaided. But investigators from the councils found that he had 'no apparent issues with his sight', the court heard. They also found he was capable of walking without any help. Kalloo claimed £70,000 in benefits from Brent between 2002 and 2008 and £27,000 from Bedfordshire between 2002 and 2006. He also made a further fraudulent claim to Bedfordshire between 2009 and 2010 for £5,700. Kalloo claimed the payments in the form of direct payments for a carer to look after him, but the court was told that he opted to 'arrange his own care' rather than have the council provide it. The carer was in fact his wife – but Kalloo did not even need any help and was perfectly able to walk, drive and work without any assistance. He also owned four homes, which were rented out. He was arrested in October 2008 after investigators became suspicious and visited his home. Officials at both councils worked together after the arrest - and Brent's legal team eventually brought him to justice. They also found he had several bank accounts with thousands of pounds in them. Trial: The married 34-year-old was caught out after being spotted driving three different cars and working at a stall in a market at Watford, Hertfordshire, jurors at Harrow Crown Court (pictured) were told last week . Last week, after a seven week trial, Kalloo was found guilty of 10 counts of fraud. He will be sentenced on January 30. Brent Council's deputy leader Councillor .

"By . Neil Sears . PUBLISHED: . 11:52 EST, 3 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:19 EST, 3 January 2013 . Jailed: Charles Casey has been sentenced to nearly five years in a young offenders' institution for defrauding an elderly man of his life savings . A frail couple in their 90s were ‘robbed of their old age’ by a young conman who duped them out of £365,000 for bogus roof repairs. The bill – for work that was never carried out – amounted to more than the £350,000 value of their four-bedroom detached house. Fresh-faced Irish traveller Charles Casey, 21, was yesterday jailed for four years and eight months for swindling Ronald and Lucy Dew, 90 and 92. Casey was among a gang of eight  sentenced for building repair and driveway resurfacing frauds that netted them almost half a million pounds from pensioners in Berkshire and Devon. He began his fleecing of the Dews with a knock on the door, claiming they had a damp problem in their roof. Demands for cash escalated until the couple’s savings were gone. Retired quantity surveyor Mr Dew, married to former secretary Lucy for almost 70 years, said last night: ‘I feel very foolish to have been taken in by him. It has been two years of hell and he had robbed us of our old age.’ Mr Dew said he and his wife had hoped to spend their savings on trips to the ballet, theatre and opera – and had planned to leave a healthy inheritance for their daughter. Reading Crown Court heard that ‘heartless’ Casey – who also admitted conning elderly Edith Dobrijevic and her son Peter, 50, out of £100,000 in  Exeter – had begun making money from the vulnerable when he was 15. Between November 2007 and March 2008, he had been ‘the main money man’ in a £1million scam on a Bristol man with learning difficulties, for which he got away with a community service, which was later revised to a curfew. In 2010, shortly after the Dews had paid £17,000 for roofing work on their home in Wokingham, Berkshire, he knocked on their door. Calling himself ‘Jeffrey Andrews’, Casey told the couple the repairs had left their home suffering from damp and urgently needed dehumidifying. He asked Mr Dew to pay a deposit for machinery at a cost of £18,000, then demanded a further £18,300 for a more powerful machine. Casey cashed the cheques almost immediately. Reading Crown Court, pictured, where Casey was sentenced to four years and eight months for the 'cynical, sophisticated, heartless asset-stripping' When Mr Dew tried to get the deposits back, he was told he could ‘jump the queue’ by paying more. Daniel Fugallo, prosecuting, said Casey told Mr Dew that ‘if he divested himself of all he and his wife’s assets and put them over to him then all this, together with the deposits, would be returned to him. He was told to tell the banks none of this was to do with building work, but personal matters.’ Confused Mr Dew handed over more cheques. He also received calls from Casey’s partners in crime, one of whom claimed to be a ‘scambuster’, who told him not to call the police. In January 2011, Mr Dew agreed to hand over another £13,000 in cash – but was by then suspicious of Casey. As they discussed the situation, Casey demanded the money, which the pensioner refused to hand over, so Casey snatched the envelope from Mr Dew, which tore before Casey made off with the cash. Police were initially unable to trace the cocaine addict and father-of-one. Then in November 2011 Casey knocked on the door of the Dobrijevics, this time calling himself Anthony Fleet, shortly after they had paid £59,000 for paving on their driveway. He claimed they had been scammed but he could fix it, and got them to hand over £19,000 in cash and around tens of thousands more in cheques before they called police. Officers were at their home in April 2012 to arrest Casey when he drove round to collect a further £19,000. His fingerprints matched those on the remains of Mr Dew’s torn envelope. Casey admitted three money-laundering offences, two counts of conspiracy to defraud, and robbery. Judge Nicholas Wood said of the defrauding of the Dews: ‘It was a cynical, sophisticated, selfish, heartless asset-stripping of a gullible 88-year-old man causing great shock, divesting him of his life savings of £365,000.’ Casey’s seven fellow gang members were jailed in November, receiving terms of between ten months and two years and three months for having cash from the scams paid into their accounts.","Charles Casey, 21, told Ronald Dew his roof needed to be dehumidified .

A scorned ex-lover of Grammy Award-winning reggae artist Sean Paul has exposed the star's alleged 'severe erection problems' in a tell-all book, as she sues him for $80 million. Swede, Susanne Persson, who brags in court documents of having long 'Barbie hair' and an 'E-cup bra' size, claims Paul 'bribed Jamaican police' to have her deported from the country in June 2010 - something which drove her to attempt suicide. Getting intimate revenge, Persson filed a self-penned 120-page alleged exposé to support her Manhattan Supreme Court lawsuit, in which she claims that 'if (sex with Paul) lasts one minute, it is a good day.' The 11-capter work, titled: 'Irie Jamboree: My life in Jamaica as a jet set slave with the enormous secret of a love affair with Jamaica's perhaps most well known Dancehall Artist.' The cover features a childish drawing of Persson wearing a blue sari embracing a mohawked Paul, and reads: 'The Truth About Sean Paul's Cocaine Dealings, Lies, Murders and Erection Problems.' Inside, she claims: 'Ever since (Paul) started using cocaine regularly, he has had severe erection problems. If it lasts one minute, it is a good day.' According to The New York Post, Persson included her American Airlines itinerary from Kingston, Jamaica, to Stockholm, Sweden, on June 24, in the court filing.

Paul's lawyer, Tom Taveres-Finson, denied his client had his former flame kicked out of the country. 'He would not have the power to do that,' Taveres-Finson told The Post from Jamaica. Persson claims she tried to take her own life the day before she flew out, and then sent photos of her slit wrists to the reggae artist.

"By . Peter Allen . PUBLISHED: . 23:03 EST, 2 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:00 EST, 3 January 2013 . A gunman thought to have murdered three women in a rampage through an Alpine village is to be questioned about a similar massacre on a British family last year, it emerged today. Police in Switzerland are waiting to interview the 33-year-old psychiatric patient, named locally by his first name Cedric, thought to be responsible for last night's carnage in Daillon, in the Valais canton, 60 miles east of Geneva. The man, who has a history of threatening people with guns, is in a 'stable condition' in intensive care after being shot in the chest by a tactical police firearms unit last night. Scroll down for video . Echoes of last time: Three members of a British family and a French cyclist were shot dead in an Alpine beauty spot (pictured) last year, less than 100 miles from the site of the latest attack . Problems: Police had previously confiscated weapons from the gunman when he was put in a psychiatric ward . Bloodbath: Swiss police begin their investigation in Daillon today, after three people were shot dead and two injured in the village last night . Shocking violence: Police in the remote village this morning, after they were called to the scene yesterday at 9pm following reports of people lying shot in the street . Swiss general prosecutor Catherine Sappey said today: ''The man was known for having issued threats. Had they not stopped him he would have killed more people.' At around 8.30pm, the alleged killer, who is believed to have been thrown out of the Swiss Army for making threats with guns, stormed out of the Channe D'Or (Gold Pitcher) restaurant in Daillon following a heavy drinking session, and picked up two rifles from his nearby flat. He is then said to have used the weapons - a hunting gun and an antique military carbine used by the French Army in the world wars - to kill and maim those around him. Witnesses said he fired indiscriminately, first from his flat before turning his guns on a nearby lane and a multi-storey car park. His principal targets were apparently three women aged 32, 54 and 79 - all of whom he knew - while two men aged 33 and 63 were badly wounded. One, a retired police chief, is thought to be the suspected killer's uncle. The survivors were tonight 'critical but stable' after being airlifted to hospital in nearby Sion, the capital of Valais. Picking up the pieces: Forensics officers in the village, where the unnamed 33-year-old fired up to 20 shots at neighbours and the police . Tragedy: The gunman is a local resident known as a drug addict and former mental patient . The youngest victims of the 45-minute rampage, the 32-year-old woman and 33-year-old man, were a married couple with young children. The attack had disturbing similarities to the one in which four people including a British couple were shot dead by a mystery gunman in September, less than 100 miles away. British engineer Saad al-Hilli, 50, his wife Iqbal, 47, and mother-in-law Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, were killed alongside 45-year-old French cyclist Sylvain Mollier in an Alpine beauty spot close to the French village of Chevaline, by Lake Annecy. Police are largely baffled about what happened in the French attack, although they fear that the assailant might have been a crazed psychiatric patient with a history of threatening people with guns. Terrifying: Part of the pretty village is cordoned off after the killer was arrested and placed in custody . Gun collection: Swiss general prosecutor Catherine Sappey said 'at least two weapons were used' including a hunting rifle and an antique military carbine dating back to before World War Two . The Chevaline attacker is also thought . to have used an antique weapon, possibly an ex-military Luger handgun, . parts of which were found at the scene. As in Chevaline, those who died in . Daillon received clinical shots to the head and chest, while those . wounded received shots to the shoulder and pelvis. Zainab al-Hilli, the seven-year-old . who survived the Chevaline shootings along with her four-year-old sister . Zaina, suffered a shoulder wound. French prosecutor Eric Maillaud said . at the end of last year that a deranged gun enthusiast was high on his . list of possible suspects, explaining: 'We are looking for unbalanced . people - capable of extreme violence. People who have access to weapons - . hunters, collectors, shooting club members - some of whom could have . had psychiatric problems.' Senseless violence: A crowd forms at the scene where the brutal attack took place. An elderly couple thought to be related to the gunman are among the dead . Saddened: Jean-Pierre Gross, left, chief prosecutor of Valais County, speaks beside Robert Steiner, chief of police ad interim, at a news conference in Daillon today . Both French and Swiss police today . confirmed that the Daillon killer would be questioned about the . Chevaline atrocity, with a spokesman for the Valois force adding: 'Our . inquiry will investigate every element of the attack, including possible . links with nearby crimes.' Despite having psychiatric and drug . problems and no weapons licence, the Swiss attacker spent a number of . days in protective custody in 2005 for threatening people with guns, . which were later confiscated. He is said to have fired at least 20 shots in . Daillon, a picturesque village surrounded by vineyards, some at the . police who had come to arrest him. Local resident Marie-Paule Udry said . the unemployed man 'had drunk a lot' before the attack. He lived on his . own but under the surveillance of the local authorities, and received a . disability allowance. She said: 'We heard shots outside, dimmed the lights and hit the floor.' The Killer, named locally as Cedric, is said to have been kicked out of the Swiss Army for threatening people with guns, it has emerged. He is said to be the son of divorced parents and left home when he was 18. He spent a short spell in the military but was considered a danger and placed under psychiatric care in 2005. Cedric was described by one local as a ‘gun lover with an obsession with the army’. ‘Everyone knows him. He has no car so you often see him wandering around on foot,’ added the source. ‘He left home at 18 after his parents split up and has struggled ever since. ‘His dream in the army was to become an instructor, but he was soon thrown out. He became a waster - spending all his time smoking cannabis and playing video games.’ The source said Cedric had been in dispute with his ex-police chief uncle, who was one of his victims. A former classmate of Cedric described him as a mixture of ‘Rambo and boy scout’, saying that he once had a big collection of guns and knives which he kept at home. A Swiss police spokesman last night confirmed that the killer was now ‘stable’ and - despite his injuries - would ‘soon be in a position to speak’. Josette Dessimoz, who runs the Restaurant Alpes in Daillon, said: 'My sister-in-law heard shooting and went out on the street and was herself shot.' Weapons possession is extremely high in Switzerland, where soldiers are allowed to take guns home . Striking similarities: Police had been looking for a mentally unstable gunman living in the area in relation to the French Alps massacre of last year . Rules: Part-time soldiers in Switzerland can keep guns at home, as long as they are not fully automatic and ammo is restricted . Police arrived in Daillon after receiving reports of people lying in the streets following a spate of gunfire. They wounded the gunman after . initially finding it difficult to locate him in the dark, and he was . arrested and placed in custody by a special tactical team. Police spokesman Jean-Marie . Bornet said: 'At the moment there is incomprehension and shock here in . Valais. The toll is very, very heavy. It's a sombre start to the year . for the canton. 'It wasn't easy to . intervene in the darkness. The gunman turned his weapon on the officers, . who had to shoot him in order not to be injured themselves.' Arrested: The gunman was wounded after officers struggled to find him in the dark . Not the first time: The attack took place less than 100 miles from the French village where five people were shot dead by a mystery gunman last year . Armed and dangerous: Up to three million guns are in circulation in the nation of eight million . Nathalie Frizzi was walking her dogs when she heard gunfire, saying: 'There were people running around near the chapel. 'At first I didn't realise what was . going on. I thought children were shooting at cats and I called out for . them to stop. I am still shocked at the thought that I could have been . hit by a bullet.' Local authority chief Christophe Germanier said: 'The day was sunny here but the night black. What a terrible start to 2013.' Daillon has a population of just 400 people. The alleged killer moved there a number of years ago from the nearby town of Conthey. Gun ownership is widespread in Switzerland, with around a quarter of the eight million population carrying weapons. Army-issue weapons are used in the deaths of more than 300 people in Switzerland every year. A judicial investigation has been opened into the latest killings in Daillon, although none of the victims have yet been named. On guard: Army-issue weapons are used in the deaths of more than 300 people in Switzerland every year . Cordon: A policeman controls traffic on the road into Daillon following the shooting .

Petrified: Hayley Willetts was robbed at knifepoint in her flat, but later discovered it had been a cruel scam engineered by her own boyfriend . A young woman was subjected to an 'elaborate, frightening and cruel' hoax by her own partner who sent a friend to rob her at knifepoint because he wanted her cash. Petrified Hayley Willetts, 21, handed over her savings after an armed robber burst into her flat demanding money. The attacker even appeared to try to stab her boyfriend Gavin Fowler in the head to make the scam look as genuine as possible. He then took Fowler, 34, as a fake hostage before fleeing. When police arrested the suspect, Miss Willetts was devastated to discover that Fowler had staged the whole thing, a court heard. Prosecutor Tony Trigg said: 'He was in on it from the start and it was a cruel deception. 'What was taken might not have worth an awful lot of money but it was everything of value she owned.' The court was told how the thief pretended to kidnap Fowler leading him from the flat at knifepoint. Miss Willetts phoned the police reporting the hold-up at her flat in Ystrad Mynach, near Caerphilly, South Wales. But she was shocked when they told her they had caught the thief near her home and that it was her boyfriend. And Cardiff Crown Court heard he'd set up the bogus raid - and the the knifeman was his friend Anthony Darker. Mr . Trigg said: 'Fowler told his frightened girlfriend to calm down and do . everything Darker asked as he demanded her phone, money and jewellery. 'Keeping up the pretence, he said: ""If you don't listen, he will stab me"". She got her purse and handed over £5, but Darker told her it wasn't enough. 'He pushed Fowler, lunging at him with the knife and sticking it in the door, inches from his head.' 'Wicked men': Miss Willetts's boyfriend Gavin Fowler (left) arranged for his friend Anthony Darker (right) to raid his partner's flat in a scam to extract money from her . But Cardiff Crown Court heard how Fowler was never in any danger because he'd engineered the whole thing. Fowler and his accomplice left the scene with Hayley's mobile phone, television, DVD player, and a gold bracelet. And the scammer thought he'd got away with his ruse until he was arrested near the scene and officers found some of the stolen goods on him. Judge Stephen Hopkins QC said: 'This was an elaborate, frightening and cruel hoax. She was petrified and you are wicked men.' 'Scary memories': The flat in Ystrad Mynach, where the robbery took place. Miss Willetts says she has now left the home because of what happened there . Both Darker, of Cardiff, and Fowler, of Ystrad Mynach, were jailed for four years after they admitted robbery. After the case, Miss Willets said she since had to leave the flat. She said: 'I have since to leave the flat because it held too many scary memories. 'I can't believe they could be so cruel. I loved Gavin and I would have given him money if he had asked for it.'","Hayley Willetts, 21, handed over her savings to robber sent by her boyfriend .

He may be one of hockey's rising stars, but Detroit Red Wings prospect Riley Sheahan’s antics are raising eyebrows off-the-ice. Sheahan, 20, of Ontario, Canada, who now plays with the Red Wings minor league affiliate the Grand Rapids Griffins, was pulled over in a bizarre drunken driving arrest back on October 29. He later submitted to a breathalyzer test and blew a .30 - more than three times the legal limit - classifying him under Michigan's 'super drunk' law (.17 or higher). Busted: Riley Sheahan, pictured in his mugshot at left, and playing for Notre Dame at right, was charged with DUI last month under Michigan's 'super drunk' law . MLive.com reported that if there is anything more shocking than his blood-alcohol level, it was his choice of attire - a purple Teletubbies costume, that of Tinky Winky. Given the date of his arrest, it is likely that Sheahan was driving to or from a Halloween party, but that detail could not be verified. If convicted, he faces up to 180 days in jail and may be booted back to Canada. When he was pulled over by officers, he allegedly handed over the driver’s license of Brendan Smith, a teammate and fellow Red Wings prospect. Odd behavior: When Sheahan was arrested on October 29, he was reportedly wearing a purple Teletubbies costume, that of Tinky Winky . Police allege that Sheahan was using the 23-year-old Smith's ID so that he could drink alcohol. The arresting officer wrote in the police report: 'Riley is only 20 and I asked him if he had Branden’s (sic) ID so he could get in the bars. He shook his head yes and stated ""yea.""' MLive.com reported that Sheahan pleaded not guilty to the charges of DUI and providing false information to a police officer on November 6. His next court date is slated for December 13. When asked about Sheahan's arrest, Red . Wings general manager Ken Holland told the Detroit Free Press: 'I'm . aware that Riley was charged with a DUI. We're handling it internally.

Top dog: Apple CEO Tim Cook brought in $4.17million in 2012, down from $378million last year . Tim Cook may be at the top of the Apple empire, but the paycheck may not show it. The chief executive of Apple took a 99 per cent pay cut in his first full year in the job. Cook, who succeeded the late Steve Jobs, was awarded total compensation of $4.17million in 2012, down from $378million in 2011, Apple said in a federal filing today. The 2012 compensation package for Cook, who took over as chief executive in August 2011, also seemed a pittance compared with his 2010 pay, which was 14 times higher, when the executive served as chief operating officer.

The stock awards vest over many years. The 2012 package includes a salary of $1.4million and a non-equity bonus of $2.8million, according to the filing. Apple tends to grant shares to executives every other year. Cook's closest cohorts got big grants in 2012, including top hardware engineer Robert Mansfield, who got shares worth $83million. Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer and general counsel Bruce Sewell both got stock grants worth just over $66million, more than double the value of the grants they got two years ago, reflecting the zooming value of Apple's stock.

A former Melrose Place actress was today convicted of vehicular homicide after a drink-drive crash that killed a 60-year-old woman and left her husband severely injured. A jury Tuesday acquitted Locane-Bovenizer, 40, of a more serious charge, aggravated manslaughter, in a 2010 accident that killed Helene Seeman. Somerset County prosecutors said her blood-alcohol level was nearly three times the legal limit when the crash occurred on a dark two-lane road in Montgomery Township.

Locane-Bovenizer eventually asked, 'I’m sorry, am I getting a DWI?' Officer Wilkes added. Last month, Mrs. Seeman's husband Fred, who survived the crash, told jurors that he watched his wife die as he gave emotional testimony in court.

A popular New Jersey teacher has been dismissed for streaking around his apartment block. Mark Bringhurst, 40, was named 2011-12 teacher of the year at Winslow Elementary School, where he had been a fifth-grade teacher for the last eight years. But police charged Bringhurst for making a naked dash in March and, under new employment laws, he was sacked for acting 'in an improper manner.' On a streak: Mark Bringhurst (left), 2011-12 teacher of the year, lost his job for running naked through the parking lot at Greenwich Village Apartments (right) The Daily Journal reports that officers were called to Greenway Village Apartments in West Berlin, New Jersey, on the evening of March 21. A witness had complained that a naked man was running through the parking lot and he was worried about the safety of children in the area. The caller also stated that this wasn't the first time that the same nude man had sprinted through the apartment complex. The police tracked Bringhurst down to his car in the parking lot of an adult bookstore. At first he denied the charge, then admitted he had done it as a dare. The teacher apologized and said he had never intended anyone to see him. When the teacher asked to be reinstated in his job it initiated a battle between Bringhurst and the school district. Bringhurst did not dispute the facts of the incident, but claimed he was cooperative with the investigation, that he had sought help immediately after his arrest and that he was no longer in contact with the person that set the dare in the first place. In August, the Board of Education members voted for Bringhurst's dismissal and his sacking was made public earlier in December. This case is the first to use a new tenure law that is designed to reduce the amount of time it takes to resolve such disputes. School arbitrator Robert C Gifford wrote that Bringhurst 'exercised severely poor judgment on more than one occasion. His lack of judgment is not diminished by the fact that his conduct occurred outside the school setting.' School Superintendent Mary Gruccio claimed the district demanded his dismissal because 'his behavior cannot be tolerated by the Vineland public school district,' reported the Daily Journal. On their website the apartment block that Bringhurst streaked through claims: 'Greenway Village Apartments offers a relaxing atmosphere that allows you a peaceful alternative to your hectic, daily schedule. 'No matter how stressful your day may be, the serene surroundings of our community will show you how enjoyable it is to come home.'

Disgraced former Penn State coach Jerry Sandusky says he's trying to 'learn and grow' in prison and bemoans his trial lacked 'justice and fairness' in a newly-revealed handwritten letter. Sandusky, 68, has been sitting in the Pennsylvania jail cell since he was convicted of 45 counts of sexually abusing 10 boys over a period of 15 years while he served as the college football team's defensive coordinator. It was revealed during the widely-watched case that he met and groomed his victims through his charity, The Second Mile. Shamed: Jerry Sandusky, pictured on October 9, was slapped with a 30 to 60 year sentence in the child sex case . Reaching out: The letter, scrawled on both sides of a thin scrap of paper, is dated December 18 and addressed to The Citizens' Voice reporter Michael Sisak . The letter, scrawled on both sides of a thin scrap of paper, is dated December 18 and addressed to The Citizens' Voice reporter Michael Sisak. Sandusky opens the letter with an apology for the odd paper. He writes: 'Please excuse the paper and informality. I’ve had some problems with commissary which has delayed my response and created a paper problem.' Sandusky thanks Sisak for his interview request and says that although he 'has a lot to say,' he has been advised against it while he focuses on his appeal. But he goes on to explain his problems with his trial, explaining that it was conducted without 'justice and fairness' and how he is now trying to 'learn and grow' from his 'struggles.' Jaileed: Sandusky says in the letter that he is focused on his appeal and is looking to learn and grow from his 'struggles' Sandusky closes with a list of his goals that he 'mentally' tells himself. The first letter of each line spells out the word ENDURE. Earlier this month, it was revealed that Sandusky lives under tight restrictions in prison for his own safety, and housed outside of the general population . He is on hard routine after he asked for more prison privileges and then received threats from inmates. 'He is being housed in the appropriate facility in order to assure his safety,' said Susan McNaughton, press secretary for the Pennsylvania state Department of Corrections. She responded to questions from Reuters after one of Sandusky's lawyers complained that his client was confined to his cell 23 hours a day. Sandusky's attorney, Karl Rominger, said that his client is 'being treated like the worst of the worst in the state prison system in terms of his daily routine.' He said Sandusky is treated like extremely violent offenders, or those on death row. He was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison. The scandal sparked a national debate over child sex abuse, embarrassed the university and implicated a number of its top officials including legendary football head coach, the late Joe Paterno. There has been speculation that Sandusky would be threatened by other inmates in prison if he was given more privileges. Sandusky, who has maintained his innocence, is in a 1,800-inmate maximum security prison that serves as death row for the state. Rominger said he would like to see Sandusky transferred to a less restrictive prison that houses inmates who are less violent. Michael, . Please excuse the paper and informality. I’ve had some problems with commissary which has delayed my response and created a paper problem. I appreciate your interest in interviewing me. At this time there is much I would like to say. However, because of appeals, etc., I have been advised against it. It would also take some time here to make that possible. Our position in this could change in the future. Right now, our focus is on appeal. There is much to learn, issues and information, not presented. Nobody, who caused the case and reported it had the time or took the time to study the allegations, the accusers, the inconsistency and the methods. Justice and fairness were not a focus. If you want, stay in touch as this evolves. In the meantime, I’m trying to learn from, grow from and endure the struggles and circumstances. I talk to myself (only mentally) with a goal - mostly follow: . E - Embrace each day as a gift.N - Never surrender except to God.D - Don't let your situation get the best of you.U - Understand God's purpose and presence.R - Remain as positive as possible.E - Exercise your mind, body and spirit.

Nonchalant: UC Berkley junior Nadia Cho is not concerned about the media frenzy that was set off by her controversial column describing her sex romp on campus . A first-person account of her naked romp in the Library of University of California at Berkley has made Nadia Cho an overnight international sensation, but the psychology major hasn't shared the news with her parents yet. The Hawaii native, who . describes herself as bisexual, said that she hasn't told them . that she has been writing sex columns, though she suspects her . father may have caught wind of it what with the furor surrounding her much talked about  piece. ‘I'm not sure any parent expects this. But I mean, what can you do? I just don't talk to my parents about sex,’ she said. Cho, a junior at the prestigious California school, went from a virtual unknown to a branded sex expert after writing a column for her college paper about how she had sex all over campus. The article published in The Daily Californian caught the attention of global media outlets, among them the Daily Mail and the Huffington Post, which ended up hiring Cho as its newest sex columnist. But speaking to the San Francisco Chronicle this week, the petite 20-year-old dismissed her newfound exposure with a shrug and a sarcastic reply. 'Unless one day I'm going to work for Christians Against Masturbation, I think I'm fine,’ she said. While headhunters and job experts are busy warning young people to keep their online presence squeaky clean so as not to scare off potential employers later in life, Cho doesn't seem to worried that a Google search of her name yields the term 'sexcapade.' Berkeley Student Nadia Cho's Twitter Profile reads: 'i like coffee, cats, and ice cream. and being the sex on tuesday columnist at the @dailycal :)' Online history: While educators warn young people about keep their web presence clean for professional reasons, Cho, seen here apparently smoking pot, is not concerned that her sex escapade would harm her career . Cho's detailed account was part of her weekly column in The Daily Californian, Berkeley’s independent, student-run newspaper. Cho wrote . that she and an unnamed male student started their romp in Berkeley’s . library, Main Stacks, the day before Thanksgiving, when the campus was . ‘marvelously empty.' But other students were in the . library studying while the two performed and more than one student . walked by them in mid-act, Cho wrote. She and her partner then moved into one of Berkeley’s classrooms, as she graphically described. ‘Sex isn’t always about c****** and having orgasms. Sometimes it’s for s**** and giggles,’ she wrote. ‘Having expectations and goals can . ruin the fun of it. Besides, it’s probably not a good idea to ejaculate . in public places - just saying. Keep this in mind should you ever . attempt sex on campus.’ Cho wrote that her experience was inspired by a spring 2012 column for the paper, ‘Sex on campus: actually doable?’ Her response: ‘yes - having sex on campus is actually very doable, and it’s lots of fun. It’s also surprisingly easy.’ Not so private: The Main Stacks library at Berkeley University, where Cho says she and an unnamed male student had sex . After . graduating from college, Cho said she plans to go into research. She currently . works part time at a campus cafe and has never considered writing . professionally, she said. ‘I . don't want to be a sex columnist for my whole life. It has a time and a . place,’ she told the Chronicle. ’I don't regret publishing the piece. I intended to do . it. I don't really mind that people know I'm having sex. And who cares . if it's online - what isn't?’ Cho . was taken aback by the uproar over her piece. In her earlier Sex on . Tuesdays columns, she has addressed the etiquette of taking part . in a threesome, taking the stigma out of watching porn, and bisexuality, . but her writing has generated little reaction on campus.

Pulmonary hypertension is a serious medical condition . involving raised blood pressure within the pulmonary arteries - the blood . vessels that supply the lungs. It has a variety of causes: it can be inherited, related to other health conditions such as a hole in the heart, or the cause may be unknown. It can damage the right side of the heart, making it less . efficient at pumping blood around the body and getting oxygen to the muscles. In people with  pulmonary hypertension, the walls of . the pulmonary arteries are thick and stiff, making it difficult for them to . expand to allow more blood through. Alternatively, the arteries may be blocked . by blood clots which can also hinder blood flow.

Around 100,000 people were struck down with norovirus (pictured) over Christmas - and cases will continue to rise, experts have warned . Around 100,000 people were struck down with the winter vomiting bug over Christmas - and cases will continue to rise, experts have warned. Figures released today show the number of confirmed cases was 72 per cent higher than this time last year. The dramatic rise was attributed in part to an early outbreak of the illness which closed dozens of hospital wards as it swept across the country. A total of 3,877 laboratory-confirmed cases of norovirus have now been recorded in England and Wales - up on the 2,255 of last year. But the Health Protection Agency (HPA) said that for every reported case, an estimated 288 were not flagged up, meaning around 1.12 million people could now have contracted the illness this season. This is about 100,000 more than during the pre-Christmas period - until December 23 - when 1.01 million people were estimated to have come down with the bug. The number of reported cases dropped slightly during the Christmas week but this was in keeping with dips at the same time in previous seasons, the HPA said. John Harris, an expert in norovirus from the HPA, said: 'As we have seen in previous years there has been a dip in the number of confirmed laboratory reports owing to the Christmas and New Year period. 'However, in line with other norovirus seasons we will expect to see an increase in the number of laboratory reports in the next few weeks. During the two weeks up to December 30, there were 29 hospital outbreaks reported, compared to 70 in the previous fortnight, bringing the total for the season to 590. Cases of norovirus shot up earlier than expected this winter across Europe. But experts have been unable to determine why this is the case or predict whether numbers will continue to rise at the same rate. Although people can suffer from norovirus at any time of the year, activity increases in the winter months. Norovirus is no different from other viruses that circulate at this time of year, but it is incredibly infectious. It is the UK’s most common cause of gastroenteritis, and spreads easily when everyone is cooped up inside during the winter. One problem is that people do not . develop long-lasting immunity  – you are protected for only a few . months, so next winter you can easily get it again. The vomiting viruses, colds and flu tend . to peak in winter partly because people congregate inside, explains Dr . Ron Cutler, director of biomedical science at Queen Mary, University of . London. ‘Viruses can be picked up and passed on . often as a result of poor hygiene — which often means people just not . washing their hands,’ says Dr Cutler. ‘A get-together where people are in . close contact inside — for example, a concert in a closed venue, or a . church carol service — is the perfect environment for viruses to . spread.’ He adds: ‘The problem with viruses is . that in the first phase of infection there are no signs or symptoms — . and this can last for days, although normally people are contagious at . this stage so it can then be passed on to other people.’ Viruses also survive longer during . winter weather, thanks to the lack of sunshine and the damp weather . conditions, says Professor Ian Jones, a virologist from Reading . University. For norovirus, you need exposure to only . a small number of virus particles — between ten and 100 — to catch the . sickness compared with 10,000 particles to catch flu. ‘You only need to come into contact with . a single droplet from a sneeze — which can contain up to a million . virus particles — to become infected with a cold,’ says Professor Jones. Mr Harris added: 'Norovirus is very contagious, and anyone who has had it knows it is very unpleasant. 'If you think you . may have the illness then it is important to maintain good hand hygiene . to help prevent it spreading. ""We also advise that people stay away . from hospitals, schools and care homes as these environments are . particularly prone to outbreaks.' A Department of Health spokesman said: 'The NHS is well prepared for the winter. No A&Es have had to close so far this winter and we are providing additional funding to the NHS to help it cope with the added pressure that the winter brings. 'Flu and norovirus are typical at this time of year - that's why we are running the 'Catch It. Bin It. Kill It' campaign to remind people that one of the best ways to stop the spread of winter bugs is to Catch It, Bin It and Kill It when you cough or sneeze and wash your hands regularly. 'Our weekly published figures show the number of beds closed across the NHS due to norovirus symptoms is around 2.4 per cent. This compares to 2.9% of beds that were closed during the peak of norovirus cases last winter.'","Figures released today show the number of confirmed cases was 72 per cent higher than this time last year .

A toddler who had 70 per cent of her kidneys removed in her  battle with cancer has been given the all-clear. Rumeysa Kose had 27 gruelling courses of chemotherapy after a cluster of malignant tumours was found in her kidneys in April. Her father Osman, 33, had noticed lumps on the 16-month-old’s abdomen and took her to the doctors, who immediately admitted her to hospital to begin treatment. Touched: Football star Mark Owen was moved when he met brave toddler Rumeysa Kose at University Hospital of North Staffordshire . However, tests soon showed that the chemotherapy wasn’t getting rid of the cancer and doctors told Mr Kose that the affected organ ‘looked more like a tumour with a kidney on it than a kidney with a tumour’. In June, surgeons removed Rumeysa’s entire right kidney and a third of her left during a five-hour operation at Birmingham’s Children Hospital. After the operation the youngster was moved to University Hospital of North Staffordshire. And yesterday Rumeysa was finally allowed back home to Clayton, Staffordshire, where she can play with her four-year-old brother Huseyin. Her mother Esra, 31, said: ‘Because she was so young when she was diagnosed, as her mother, you often wish it was yourself who was ill. We’ve been told by the doctor that the cancer can come back, but hopefully it won’t.’ Mr Kose, a computing student, added: ‘If we hadn’t found the lump  on her tummy when she was having  a bath, I dread to think what would have happened.’ After her operation, the toddler, was moved to University Hospital of North Staffordshire. Just before Christmas she was visited by ex-England footballer Michael Owen who posed for pictures with her and promised to keep in touch with the family. He was touched by Rumeysa's plight as he handed out Christmas presents to youngsters at the children's centre at the hospital with other Stoke City players. Today her thrilled parents, Osman, 33, and Esra, 31, thanked the 33-year-old goal scorer for his support, saying they gave them a 'real lift'. Rumeysa has had to endure 27 rounds of debilitating chemotherapy that have left her unable to walk . He said: 'When the doctor told us what was wrong with Rumeysa I went into shock. 'The consultant spent five or 10 minutes trying to explain what was wrong with her to me and my wife, but I just couldn't hear what he was saying. 'I could see his mouth moving but there was no sound, I was just in shock. 'You would not have known there was anything wrong with Rumeysa, she was a happy smiley child, always laughing. 'If we hadn't found the lump on her tummy when she was having a bath I dread to think what would have happened. Rumeysa Kose and her four-year-old brother Huseyin . 'The treatment has left her so very weak, it is a strong chemotherapy leaving her legs weakened, she should have learnt to walk by now, but it is a huge effort for her just to crawl. 'When they did some tests they found the tumour was huge and the chemo wasn't getting rid of it all. 'They told me it looked more like a tumour with a kidney on it than a kidney with a tumour. 'So they had to go in and remove one kidney and a third of the other. 'The visit in hospital from Michael Owen was brilliant. 'You could see that everyone at the hospital got a lift from it. After 27 courses of chemotherapy, Rumeysa has been given the all clear . 'We had been through some real dark times, very bad, but talking to him and seeing him take an interest gave us such an emotional lift. 'He was absolutely lovely and though Rumeysa didn't know who he was the effect it had on the rest of us really helped her. 'Now she is still going to have a few more sessions of chemotherapy and may need a kidney transplant one day, but right now she is clear and that is wonderful. 'I just want to thank everyone who took an interest in my little girl, it was so heartwarming and helped us so much.' Speaking from training yesterday, kind-hearted Owen said: 'It is great news to hear that Rumeysa is well again, especially at this time of year. 'I loved visiting the children at the hospital and this news just tops it off perfectly.'","Sixteen month old Rumeysa Kose given all clear after an eight month battle .

An obesity ‘tsar’ should be appointed at every NHS trust to tackle a crisis affecting  millions, leading doctors say. They also want an individual appointed at government level to oversee the new health drive. A study by The Royal College of Physicians found that the UK is second only to the US for weight problems and the situation is getting worse. Crackdown: Leading doctors have advised that an obesity tsar should be appointed at every NHS trust to tackle a growing crisis . Yet treatment is still ‘inadequate’ adding to the annual £5billion cost of dealing with the issue. The Royal College said two out of three hospitals lack ‘joined-up’ services for patients who are obese or  overweight. Complications the patients face include heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, sleep disorders and gynaecological problems. The RCP said every NHS trust should have an obesity champion to co-ordinate services and improve staff training. Nationally, a government appointee should drive an obesity strategy across a number of ministries including health, the Treasury, education and sport. Complications: Obese patients face heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, sleep disorders and gynaecological problems . ‘The Government has failed to address this in a joined-up way which is essential if we are to make an impact,’ said the report. The obesity tsar or figurehead could come from the House of Lords and should be politically independent, according to RCP vice-president Professor John Wass. ‘In the US, Michelle Obama and the mayor of New York have made a big difference to how obesity is being tackled,’ he said. ‘Britain is getting bigger and whilst we try to prevent the increase in obesity, we must also prepare the NHS for the influx of patients presenting with severe complex obesity. ‘A patient may arrive at my hospital with coronary heart disease, but if the root cause of their condition is obesity, we must be equipped to deal with that root cause.’ The RCP says the NHS’s response to the problem has been ‘patchy’, with inadequate training for staff and poor education in nutrition. With an estimated 700,000 Health Service employees seriously overweight, they are setting a bad example to patients, it said. The inadequate provision of services is highlighted by a 93-fold variation in the rate of stomach surgery for obesity between different hospitals in England. The report recommends a systematic review of specialist obesity services – offered by just 37 per cent of hospitals – and the creation of multidisciplinary teams formed of physicians, surgeons, dieticians  and nurses. GPs should be able to raise weight issues with patients and ‘leave judgmental attitudes behind’. Around one in four adults – nine million in England – are obese, along with almost one in five children aged ten and 11. Professor Nick Finer, co-author of the report and a obesity specialist, said: ‘We need to see improved leadership on obesity at every level, from the appointment of a lead physician in every trust to the creation of a cross-governmental role.’ A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘We are taking action to help people keep a healthy weight and prevent them needing hospital care for obesity-related conditions. ‘The medical profession has a key role in providing advice and treatment to people who are overweight or obese and the Royal College of Physicians can help its members do this. ‘The NHS has a range of programmes in place to encourage weight loss.’","UK second only to the US for weight problems and situation is getting worse .

Diabetes sufferers are almost 50 per cent more likely to suffer a heart attack than the rest of the population according to new figures . People with diabetes are almost 50 per cent more likely to have a heart attack than the rest of the population, says a new report. It reveals for the first time the scale of complications affecting people with diabetes, who also have a much greater risk of potentially fatal conditions like heart failure, angina and stroke and of needing amputations. And it's not only those with type 2 diabetes - type 1 diabetes sufferers, a condition which develops in childhood, are also at a greater risk of heart attack. The findings come from the National Diabetes Audit which analysed the care of two million people with diabetes in 2010/11 in England and Wales. According to the report, 14,476 of those included in the audit had a heart attack during 2010/11, which is 4,694 more than expected. In 2010/11 - 45,000 people with diabetes suffered heart failure - 17,700 (65 per cent) more than the number expected (27,300). The report found people with diabetes are . at a 40 per cent higher risk of death than the general population, with . 65,700 diabetics dying in 2011 - when 47,000 such deaths were expected. People with diabetes are at a 40 per cent higher risk of death than the general population, with 65,700 diabetics dying in 2011 - when 47,000 such deaths were expected. The report estimates there were 22,200 excess deaths in England and 1,900 in Wales among people with diabetes. Around 2.8 million people have diabetes in the UK, while an additional 850,000 people are unaware they have it. The report included people with type 1 diabetes, which usually develops in childhood and is controlled by insulin injections, and type 2 - which is linked to unhealthy lifestyles and obesity. Nine out of ten people with diabetes have type 2 which occurs when the body gradually loses the ability to process blood sugar, leading to high levels which can damage body organs and years of ill-health. A diabetic is pictured using a lancet to test blood glucose levels. The study showed that both type 1 and type 2 diabetes sufferers are at risk of heart problems and health complications (file picture) The report estimates there were 22,200 excess deaths in England and 1,900 in Wales among people with diabetes. Women with diabetes were at a greater relative risk of death than men with diabetes: at 142 per cent for Type 1 and 40 per cent for Type 2 for women, compared to 130 per cent and 33 per cent respectively for men. Audit lead clinician Dr Bob Young said: 'These results highlight the huge impact of diabetes on disability and premature death. 'Some districts have appreciably lower diabetes related complications than others.' The audit for England and Wales is managed by the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) in partnership with Diabetes UK and commissioned by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP). Campaigners claim the health toll is the 'tip of the iceberg' as the audit does not include 10 per cent of people with the condition and those living elsewhere in the UK. Barbara Young, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said: 'It is a tragedy that a large proportion of these thousands of extra heart attacks could have been prevented simply through better education, treatment and care. 'We hope this report spurs the NHS into action to improve the current situation where fewer than half of people with diabetes meet the recommended cholesterol levels and a significant minority are not even having it measured.' A report from MPs last month found 24,000 people with diabetes die needlessly each year despite the NHS spending £3.9 billion on their care. There is an 'unacceptable postcode lottery' of care across the country, with massive variations, said the Public Accounts Committee. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said 'People with diabetes should be able to expect excellent care from the NHS and they will get it more consistently in future. 'I know there has been progress, but there is still unacceptable variation and we are determined to put that right.' Health secretary Jeremy Hunt says that people with diabetes will be able to expect more consistent healthcare from the NHS in the future . The UK has the fifth highest rate of type 1 diabetes, which develops in children, according to a charity . The UK has the world's fifth highest rate of type 1 diabetes, which develops in children, according to a health charity. Diabetes UK says 24.5 per 100,000 children under 14 in the UK are diagnosed every year with Type 1 diabetes which, unlike the other main strand, Type 2, is not linked to lifestyle or obesity factors. Of the 89 countries included in the charity's data, only Finland, Sweden, Saudi Arabia and Norway have higher rates than the UK. The UK rate is more than double that in France and Italy; and in Papua New Guinea and Venezuela, which have the joint lowest reported rates in the world, just 0.1 per 100,000 develop the condition a year. Scientists do not fully understand why there is such wide variation, but genetics is thought to play a role. Type 1 diabetes, where the body does not produce insulin, can lead to serious illness and even death if it is not diagnosed quickly. In the UK only 9 per cent of parents are aware of its symptoms and a quarter of the 2,000 children a year who develop diabetes are only diagnosed once they are already ill, according to the charity. Symptoms include; frequent urinating; excessive thirst; extreme tiredness; and unexplained weight loss.","The National Diabetes Audit analysed the care of two million diabetes sufferers in the UK .

'A thing goes off in your head that this is the end,' he told The Herald, adding that the life-changing event has deepened his faith and dramatically changed his outlook. 'I would say that I definitely became much more religious,' Kirk said. 'They say there are no atheists in foxholes, and this stroke put me into a very deep foxhole.

More than one in four Britons have the early signs of liver disease, according to the British Liver Trust . A booze-free January is not enough to repair the liver and keep it healthy, leading experts have warned. Aside from the fact that many of us simply resume old habits once the month is over, a fatty diet and sedentary lifestyle can be just as damaging, they say. A roadshow carried out by The British Liver Trust charity last year found that 28 per cent of people tested were showing the early signs of liver disease. If left undetected however, these . early signs could lead to permanent liver damage. Liver disease, now the fifth biggest killer in the UK, has increased in the past year as British culture continues to embrace the daily consumption of alcohol and unhealthy food choices, combined with a sedentary lifestyle, the trust said. With no early warning signs, and tolerance levels varying genetically, liver testing is critical to identify early signs of damage so people can make lifestyle changes to save their lives. The charity is calling on the Government to make . early liver screening available to everyone at risk in a bid to save one . million lives a year. It believes GPs should ask their patients more lifestyle questions and offer a simple liver function test, as they do for patients with suspected high blood pressure. The charity made its plea as it launched its second Love Your Liver awareness campaign, to be led by a nationwide roadshow of 'pop-up' liver health clinics. The trust's chief executive, Andrew Langford, said: 'Last year the Love Your Liver Roadshow found that one in four people tested were showing the early signs of liver disease. Caught at this early stage, lifestyle changes allow the liver to repair itself. 'Having an alcoholic drink every night, over-indulging in rich food too frequently and not making time for regular exercise are major contributing factors for liver disease.' A key issue is that many people don't realise that regardless of alcohol intake, a lack of exercise and a fatty diet can also cause cirrhosis and liver cancer . He told The Guardian: 'In the last five years, we have seen a real decrease in the age of death from liver disease. It used to be in the 60s, now it is 58, and by 2020 we would expect it to be about 50 if it follows this trajectory. Ten years ago, it was very unusual to see a 30-year-old in a liver unit awaiting a transplant. Now it is not uncommon.' One key problem is that many of us don't realise that regardless of alcohol intake, a lack of exercise and a fatty diet can also cause cirrhosis and liver cancer. These two factors also cause fat to build up in the liver. Mr Langford added: 'It is a myth that cirrhosis is always caused by alcohol. 'As everyone is affected differently, and symptoms are almost unrecognisable until the damage is beyond repair, the Government needs to take action to help people understand the damage they are doing. 'It's not about a quick fix in January, to repair the liver and keep it healthy, people need to follow our three-step plan all-year round: 1) Take two to three days off alcohol every week; 2) get regular exercise; 3) cut down on sugar and fat. 'Our Love Your Liver campaign offers free screenings to the public at a series of pop-up liver health clinics, offering free FibroScan tests which help identify the early warning signs and practical advice about how to love your liver. 'However, we can only reach a very small group of people and we're appealing for the Government to do more.'

The 59-year-old comedian may already have flown out of the country to Dubai after being released on bail yesterday. He was detained at Heathrow Airport on Wednesday after landing to take part in Celebrity Big Brother, before deciding to pull out of the reality TV show.

He was going to be on Channel 5's Celebrity Big Brother but at the last minute they agreed to re-jig its line-up at the last minute after talks with the comedian. 'Everyone has agreed that it's for the best,' a source from the TV station said. His solicitor said in a . statement that the comedian ‘vigorously denies’ the allegations, which . he said dated back about 25 years.

On his blog he wrote: ‘The Savile . witch hunt is going a bit silly now. We all are starting to speculate . and accuse ... even in jest. So no, I don’t know who’s next. ‘Everyone has had the nod. Everyone is . an expert. Just pick someone you don’t like and say it’s them. 'As odd . as he was, Savile can’t defend himself. The bloke’s dead for God’s sake.

Doctors are confident they can save the legs of a British couple crushed by a drink-driver in Bruges. Simon Huxtable, 44, and Deborah Dale, 34, were strolling through the picturesque Belgian city on New Year's Day when they were hit by a Mercedes being driven the wrong way along a one-way street, pinning them against the wall of a house. Ms Dale, the most seriously injured of the two, remains in a medically induced coma in hospital. Injured: Simon Huxtable, 44, and Deborah Dale, 34, were crushed by a car while on a romantic holiday in Bruges . The couple’s parents rushed to Belgium . after learning of the accident, and remain at their hospital bedsides. Foreign Office officials also are providing assistance. Doctors treating the holidaymakers had feared they would be forced to amputate their legs, but Mr Huxtable appears to be recovering from his injuries and medics are optimistic that his partner will also escape losing her limbs. Inspector Philippe Dankrey said: 'There is still a small percentage chance that they will have to amputate but it seems that they will be able to save their legs. It is very good news.' The couple, from Witney, Oxfordshire, are both in intensive care at St Jan's hospital in Bruges. Family members are at their bedsides. The pair had been staying at a hotel in the heart of the city when they set out for a morning walk on New Year's Day. As they crossed the top of a T-junction at 10.30am local time, they were struck by the Mercedes. Scene of horror: The Mercedes stands in the cobbled street where Deborah Dale and Simon Huxtable were crushed . The driver, who had been at a New Year's Eve party in the city centre, failed to stop at the junction and ploughed straight into the pair, pinning them against the wall of a house. Police believe he was travelling at more than 30kph - the speed limit in that area. Inspector Dankrey said: 'He drove a bit too fast and, as he had been drinking, he had too much alcohol in his blood. 'Then he hit the couple. They were squashed between the car and the front of the house. 'Neighbours heard the victims' screaming and came out of their houses to help.' A 22-year-old was arrested for drink-driving and causing injuries to two people. He was later released from custody and his driving licence revoked for two weeks. The first pictures of the couple emerged yesterday. Mr Huxtable, from Witney, Oxfordshire, had travelled to the historic Belgian city for a romantic New Year break with Miss Dale . 'There was blood everywhere. The lady’s legs were completely crushed.’ Miss Dale’s ex-partner Kevin Ruxton branded the Belgian criminal justice system ‘disgusting’. Mr Ruxton, a computer engineer from . West London, said: ‘It’s up to a judge to decide if this drunk . 22-year-old gets any kind of sentence, I think that is preposterous. It . seems too lenient.’ He added: ‘They were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. We are still in shock.’ A spokesman for the Belgian . police said the couple remained in a serious condition. ‘There is a . possibility that they may both have to have either one or even both legs . amputated,’ he added. Sister . Emmanuelle, a Catholic nun who witnessed the horrific scene, said: ‘I . heard a big bang and then I heard loud screaming. There were two people . lying on the ground screaming and waving their arms wildly. It was . terrible. ‘The people were screaming and screaming and shouting out in English. I tried to reassure them but I cannot speak English. ‘The driver got out of the car and asked . someone to call an ambulance. People were coming out of their houses . because of the noise . ‘Finally the injured people fell silent and stopped screaming. After what seemed like a long time the police and the ambulance arrived. Horrific: Witnesses to the crash said that they heard screaming while a retired doctor who lived nearby administered first aid . ‘I have not been able to sleep since. I can still hear them screaming.' A retired doctor, who lives next to the crash site, administered first aid on the couple while they waited for the ambulance. Witness Marleen Broeckeart said: ‘There was blood everywhere. The lady’s legs were completely crushed.’ A police spokesman told the Daily Mail: ‘The driver is a local man. He had borrowed his sister’s car to come to Bruges for a New Year’s Eve party. ‘The next day he was driving the wrong way along a small street in the centre of Bruges. ‘He was meant to turn at a T-junction but he went straight on and drove into the British tourists who were walking along the footpath. 'The Mercedes is a very heavy car and it pinned them against the front of a house and they were badly hurt. ‘The driver said he had been drinking and officers found he was over the legal limit. ‘He was arrested and he was banned from driving for 15 days, which is the normal procedure. A magistrate will decide in the next couple of months if there will be any further charges.’ Popular: The historic city of Bruges attracts thousands of British tourists every year . Miss Dale’s parents, Roger and Diana, were at their daughter’s bedside at the Sint Jan Hospital in Bruges. A hospital spokesman said: ‘They are very upset. They don’t want to talk about what has happened to their daughter. It is against hospital policy to discuss the medical condition of patients with journalists.’ Bruges, which dates from the 12th century and is a UNESCO world heritage site, is a popular holiday destination attracting tens of thousands of Britons every year. The small Old Town is characterised by its winding cobbled streets, meandering canals and pretty squares surrounded by distinct Flemish red-brick houses. However behind the picturesque architecture is a rich commercial history – Bruges was an important trading centre throughout the Middle Ages.","Simon Huxtable, 44, and Deborah Dale, 34, were crushed while out walking .

Presiding magistrate Carole Howard said Birtles had come close to being jailed, and added that she had been 'distressed' to hear about his behaviour. As well as paying £1,000 compensation, Birtles was given a six-month curfew, ordered to pay £85 costs and a £60 victim surcharge. Court: Lee Birtles was ordered to pay the penalty by magistrates in Barnsley . After the hearing Neil Bowles, chairman of the South Yorkshire Police Federation said: 'The payout is quite astonishing. 'But punishments like this are an essential deterrent to assaults on officers in any manner let alone a vile offence like this. The officer also had to await test results.' He later added: 'My initial reaction upon hearing the news of the size of the compensation award was surprise, but pleasantly so. 'We in the Police Federation have been calling for stiffer penalties for those convicted of assaulting police officers for as long as I can remember.' Mr Bowles concluded: 'We applaud that decision and hope that courts across the county and the rest of England and Wales follow suit.' Birtles said afterwards he had no expected to pay so much compensation and claimed he had not intended to spit at the officer. He said he had been pepper-sprayed as he was being restrained. 'I was spitting to get it out of my mouth as I was handcuffed and my eyes were pretty much glued together,' he insisted. 'I have apologised and I'm glad I didn't get a jail sentence but the amount of compensation is high.'","Lee Birtles spat at Sarah Botham in police station .

Its neat hedges and leafy streets convey an image of conservatism and Home Counties respectability. But commuter-belt Surrey was revealed yesterday as the biggest readers of ‘mummy porn’ erotica Fifty Shades of Grey than anywhere else in the country. Readers ‘just can’t get enough’ of the tales of bondage, according to senior council officials - who have branded their own county ‘Saucy Surrey’. Picturesque: But behind the leafy highways and byways, Surrey is a hotbed of sizzling S&M sensuality. The county has been revealed as the biggest devourer of the erotic Fifty Shades books . Libraries are lending more copies of the racy book and its two sequels than in other parts of the country. Borrowing in Surrey accounted for nearly 20 per cent of all UK loans of the three books last August. Erotic: Surrey County Council said the libraries had stocked up on EL James' Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed as demand grew . And more recent figures show demand for the trilogy shows little sign of slowing down, with Surrey’s libraries making up almost 16 per cent of all recorded national lending in October. Helyn Clack, Surrey County Council’s cabinet member for community services, said the libraries had stocked up on 200 copies of each of EL James’ Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed as they rocketed up the bestseller list. She said: ‘EL James’ books have really set the pulses racing in Surrey. ‘It seems our library-goers just can’t get enough of Christian Grey’s steamy antics. ‘While the trilogy of stories won’t suit every taste, we stock around 190,000 new books a year for people to choose from, including the latest from hugely popular authors like Ian Rankin and John Grisham.’ The three books – Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed – charts the complicated and racy relationship of young graduate Anastasia Steele and damaged business tycoon Christian Grey. Fifty Shades of Grey became the bestselling book in Britain since records began in August last year, surpassing Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows with sales of 5.3million copies. Smash: Author E L James has sold 3.8 million paper books and 1.5 million e-book copies of the first book in the trilogy . The 5.3million figure comprised 3.8million paper books and 1.5million e-books. The book has sold 65million copies worldwide. Tandridge in Surrey was last year named the housewife capital of Britain. The district has the highest number of housewives of anywhere in the country, a study found, making up 64 per cent of the district’s female population. The top ten areas for the highest number of housewives included several other districts in the county. Mrs James, 49, wrote for TV crime dramas Silent Witness and Wire In The Blood before she found fame with Fifty Shades of Grey. The book is due to be turned into a Hollywood film, after the screen rights to the novel were acquired by Universal Pictures and Focus Features in March.","County revealed to be biggest readers of the sexually-explicit trilogy .

Convicted: Murugasan Natarajan was jailed for six years after evading around £2 million in customs duty while importing garlic from China . A grocer who went on the run after he was caught smuggling garlic was named as one of Britain's worst tax criminals yesterday. Murugasan Natarajan, 57, dodged paying £2million in import taxes by smuggling tons of fresh garlic from China. He was one of 32 criminals named and pictured in a 'rogues gallery' of the worst tax cheats of 2012, compiled by HM Revenue and Customs. Natarajan, of Southall, West London, imported huge containers of fresh garlic without paying duty by telling Customs officials that the product was fresh ginger, which is untaxed. But inspectors noticed that the containers used for the shipments were too cold for ginger, yet the ­perfect temperature for garlic. When the containers were opened, hundreds of boxes of fresh garlic were found inside. Natarajan ran a grocery business, Perfect Imports And Exports, and planned to sell the garlic to wholesalers. He was arrested and released on bail, but went on the run and has not been traced. He was tried in his absence last month and given a six-year jail sentence. The 32 tax cheats named by HMRC on the photo-sharing website Flickr were all given jail terms last year. Their combined sentences exceed 150 years. They included jeweller Chaudray Ali, who evaded more than £7million in VAT payments by smuggling gold from the Gulf into Britain. Ali, 50, used couriers to collect gold jewellery from Dubai and take it to Frankfurt airport, where he would collect it. Goods traded between EU countries are not subject to VAT. Ali, of Hillingdon, West London, was caught and jailed for nine years. Tax adviser Roy Faichney, 54, was jailed for four years for his part in a £70million fraud. He was managing director of Vantis Tax . Ltd and profited from a fraudulent tax avoidance scheme sold to wealthy . customers, involving donating worthless shares to charities and then . claiming tax relief . Rogues gallery: These eight men were jailed in 2012 for their part in alcohol smuggling and phone smuggling frauds . The firm was dubbed the 'singing . accountants' after Vantis employees performed a version of the Gloria . Gaynor disco classic 'I Will Survive' at their annual conference, with . the lyrics changed to celebrate the scam. One verse went: 'They should have . changed that stupid law, they should have b***ered charity, but they . have left that lovely tax relief for folks to pay to me.' The HMRC gallery features a gang that . imported 20million cigarettes from Dubai without paying the £3.3million . duty by declaring them as baby toys. Another set up a factory in . Chesterfield capable of making 625million cigarettes a year. HMRC said . the plot was worth £131million in lost taxes. Message: Treasury Minister David Gauke says: 'tax dodgers are simply storing up trouble for the future' The site also featured four men jailed . for a total of 21 years and three months for one of the biggest alcohol . smuggling frauds ever uncovered in the UK - worth £50million a year. Treasury minister David Gauke said: . 'The Government is ­committed to closing in on tax evaders. Most people . play by the rules, but HMRC is cracking down on those who don't. 'We hope that publishing these . pictures will help get across that it always make sense to declare all . your income, and tax dodgers are simply storing up trouble for the . future.' The move comes on the heels of HMRC's July campaign, which published a list of the 'most wanted' tax avoiders in the UK. This FBI-style list, which received 660,000 hits last month, was published in the hope that members of the public will help in the effort to catch them. Both campaigns form part of the Government's £917million investment in tackling tax evasion. Mr Gauke added: 'We hope that publishing these pictures will help to get across that it always makes sense to declare all your income, and tax dodgers are simply storing up trouble for the future."" Others on the list include the managing director of a tax firm who got four years for a ""gentleman's agreement"" with his deputy to share the £4.5 million profit from a fraudulent tax avoidance scheme sold to wealthy customers. In his Autumn Statement last month, Chancellor George Osborne announced a further £77million will be put into cracking down on tax cheats. Ministers are unapologetic about the crack-down, saying that tax evasion and fraud has cost taxpayers around £10 billion a year. The government says its current plans can allow it to recover an additional £7 billion in lost tax revenue each year. Alcohol smugglers: .

In an attempt to make the trade appear legitimate, over 5,700 fake business transactions were created to claim large amounts of VAT. One company run by Ravjani, Future Communications, embarked on a complex scheme to defraud by positioning itself in trading chains where it exported phones from a chain that started from a missing trader. At the same time it also acted as an importer, allowing other traders such as Unique Distribution – a sister company – to seek significant VAT payments. Cigarettes scam: .

A mother-of two who became depressed when her husband told her he was gay has successfully sued her employers Holland and Barrett for slashing her sick pay. Olga Gofmane, a manager of one of the company's branches, moved out of the family home after her former husband brought his boyfriend to the house. When Holland and Barrett reclaimed her sick pay after she had been signed off work by a doctor, Mrs Gofmane was left with just £1.50 a month. She sued the company for breach of contract. The tribunal, at Reading, Berkshire, heard how the 34-year-old told had been diagnosed with clinical depression after the breakdown of her twelve-year marriage. Mrs Gofmane told an employment tribunal: 'To the latter part of 2011 I had to deal with extremely difficult personal circumstances and consequently I started to become physically and mentally unwell. The mother,  who came to Britain with her husband from their native Latvia, said: 'I have never suffered like this before and find it very difficult to deal with.' Despite her emotional and mental state she remained at work because she had to support herself and her children. Yet her personal circumstances led to her making mistakes at the Holland & Barrett branch she managed, in Newbury, Berkshire and her line managers launched a disciplinary procedure. They also criticised her over an alleged unauthorised absence when she took a Saturday off because her daughter was ill, despite her stating she had texted her area manager to alert her. When she did see a doctor, on March 20 last year, they advised her to go off work immediately and signed her off. A friend of hers called her line manager to break the news and the following day contacted the firm's HR department. Mrs Gofmane discovered her sick pay had been deducted when she received her payslip for April. She said: 'It can be seen from my payslips that my company sick pay was reclaimed, despite the company paying statutory sick pay. 'The net effect of deducting the sick pay was a salary payment to me of £1.50. The Holland and Barrett health food shop in Newbury, Berkshire, where Olga Gofmane worked as manager . 'I rang the HR department the same day. I was sure it was a mistake. I was at my wits' end and totally distressed at the prospect of not having my salary. 'I'm a single mother with two children, with rent and bills and food to buy and was totally panicking as to how I would manage financially.' The firm conceded that it had not sent a letter alerting Mrs Gofmane to the pay reduction. The panel heard that the desperate mother had to get an emergency loan from a friend in Switzerland and also went back to work early, against her doctor's advice. Holland and Barrett later paid the money, following a grievance brought by Mrs Gofmane, but the tribunal has now ruled that their actions were in breach of the contract. The judge ordered the company to pay the £77.40 pounds Mrs Gofman incurred in arranging the loan from her friend. At the same hearing the firm was exonerated of any disability discrimination against its employee, who had alleged she was unfairly treated because of her mental health problems. Judge Russell Hardwick accepted Mrs Gofmane's regional manager's argument, that she had suspended the worker because of her not adhering to company rules on reporting absence. Following the passing of the Equality Act 2010 people with serious mental health problems have greater protection under the law and Mrs Gofmane sued the firm, which she still works for, on the basis of disability discrimination. However, the judge stated the evidence of her having a disability was 'scant' and that even if they had considered that her mental health problems amounted to a disability, Holland & Barrett was unaware of it at the time it launched disciplinary proceedings and stopped her pay. Holland & Barrett contested the allegation of disability discrimination and of breach of contract, arguing that the depression had not been diagnosed at the time and she had not made them aware that she was ill.","Mother-of-two had her sick pay reclaimed after she was signed off work with depression .

Former sports teacher Keith Ruby was jailed for a series of sexual offences against a teenage boy . A top public school teacher was jailed today for 10 years after forcing a student to strip naked for 'physical tests' before subjecting him to sexual abuse. Keith Ruby, 35, inflicted years of abuse on to his teenage victim after grooming him while working as a rugby coach at a prestigious £28,000-a-year Quaker school. He subjected the boy, who was 13 when the abuse began, to intimate 'sports massages' and carried out sick 'physical tests' to ensure he was in peak condition. Ruby, who worked at Sidcot School in . Winscombe, Somerset, was arrested in 2011 when his victim, who cannot be . named for legal reasons, admitted the abuse to his horrified parents. The . teacher denied the offences but was found guilty of 16 charges of . sexual abusing the young boy over a two year period and jailed for 10 . years yesterday. Yesterday . Judge Graham Hume Jones said that Ruby was guilty of indulging his own . sexual gratification and the offences were an 'abuse of trust in the . highest measure'. He said: . 'In my judgement from the evidence you were indulging your own personal . ambition and your sexual gratification in your relationship with this . boy. 'Not only was this an . abuse of trust in the highest measure, it is not hard to imagine the . guilt felt by the complainant's parents on being duped by you.' The . court was told how Ruby forged a close relationship with the schoolboy . and his parents, and quickly became his main confidant. The coach gained the boy's trust when working at the school, and at a nearby rugby club, which the boy also attended. He . carried out sick 'physical tests' on the boy and gave him intimate . sports massages in the abuse - which did not take place on school . property. Ian Fenny, . prosecuting at Taunton Crown Court, said: 'He gained complete trust and . affection of a young, talented rugby player. He abused the relationship . for his own sexual advantage. 'As . a consequence he was able to seduce and groom the victim and that was . because he had considerable affection and loyalty towards him.' The . abuse reached its peak when the youngster, aged only 13, revealed that . he thought he was gay - it was then Ruby made his victim masturbate with . him and perform oral sex. Former teacher Keith Ruby, 35, leaves Taunton Crown Court. He has been jailed for 10 years after forcing a student to strip naked for 'physical tests' before subjecting him to horrific abuse . Sidcot School in Winscombe, Somerset, where Ruby worked. He was then arrested in 2011 . On one occasion, while on a rugby trip . to Canada, his victim awoke to find Ruby performing oral sex on him, on . another Ruby climbed into the bath with the teen and began to fondle . him. Judge Hume Jones heard how Ruby first met his victim, when he was aged only 12, after he became a pupil at Sidcot School and joined the rugby team. The talented youngster was also a member of his local rugby club where Ruby often coached. The former teacher at Sidcot School in Winscombe, Somerset, gained so much of the teenage boy's trust that he believed the actions were normal . Manipulative Ruby singled his victim out . after he began using techniques such as describing sexual matters to . evaluate his reaction and giving him 'physical tests' as a 'cloak to . mask his attraction'. The former teacher, from Biddisham, . Somerset, was even warned of his behaviour after other coaches began . getting suspicious but this . did not stop him. When his . victim admitted he was gay Ruby took his abuse to the next level, asking . the school boy if he would masturbate in front on him, with the coach . doing likewise. The . teenager complied with Ruby's requests, which also saw him perform a set act, after he was 'very much in the thrall and became highly flattered . by the attention'. My Fenny added: 'To have an adult prepared to engage in sexual actions was something he found alluding. 'There was a close bond of loyalty but this relationship was exploitative and it was wrong.' Ruby used this close bond and trust to work himself into a position of trust with the victim's family, who believed he was giving their son one-on-one sessions to further his rugby career. He denied all charges brought against him but was found guilty by a majority verdict on December 6. Ruby was handed 10 years behind bars . on the 11 counts of engaging in sexual activity with a child and five . counts of penetrative sexual activity with a child. An initial police investigation was . launched in February 2006 after allegation about the abuse came to light . but the teenager refused to co-operate, insisting nothing was going on. The investigation collapsed in July . 2006, but a fresh probe was launched in 2011 when the victim finally . admitted the abuse to his parents. Detective .

'In the most calculating fashion, Ruby groomed his victim to gain complete control over him. 'Such was his hold, it has taken six years for his victim to disclose the abuse he suffered at Ruby's hands. 'The sentence passed by His Honour Judge Jones today will ensure that Keith Ruby is finally behind bars for a minimum of 10 years and, as a managed sex offender for the rest of his life, will never work with children again.' During sentencing, Judge Graham Hume Jones, said: 'You abused the trust of a young boy and the trust of his parents, and you brought shame on them.' The school has said all the necessary safeguarding checks were made on Ruby. The judge said Ruby was regarded as an 'ardent and enthusiastic' sports coach who encouraged the boy in his favourite sport. He said: 'But you did this to indulge your sexual interests with this boy. In his evidence, the boy used the phrase 'hero worship' to describe his relationship with you. 'Having gained his trust you then gained the trust of his parents.' The court heard the boy's family was 'duped' by Ruby who entrusted their son into his care outside school for rugby matches and an overseas trip. He said: 'It is not hard to imagine how this boy's family feel after being duped by you. He worshipped and trusted you, and lied to the police to save your skin. 'Even then you met him again and abused him.' A spokesman from the school said: 'Our safeguarding procedures, both now and at the time of these incidents, are completely compliant and all necessary checks on the suitability of Keith Ruby to work with children were carried out by the school. 'However, unfortunately no vetting system can guarantee that every paedophile is identified.'","Keith Ruby, 35, inflicted years of abuse on to his teenage victim .

Cash-strapped town halls have hired temporary workers on deals worth more than £180,000-a-year. Senior stand-ins at councils in Basildon, Southend and Essex County Council are being paid up to £800-a-day, costing £8million-a-year. Critics rounded on the ‘enormous waste of money’ and claimed dozens of lower-paid jobs could have been saved instead. Some temporary staff have been in post for more than 18 months. Temporary workers at Essex County Council employed 162 interim staff costing £7.2million, including two temps paid more than £900-a-day . At Basildon Council, one executive director who remains in a job is paid £565-a-day and was among seven other staff who earned more than £300 a day. They were all hired through agencies. One interim executive director has been in post since August 2011 and is not due to leave until April 2013. In total, Basildon Council spent £501,000 . on temporary staff in 2011-12, while Southend's seven temporary . employees cost a total of £330,000. Mike Boyle, Southend council's interim head of adult commissioning, was paid £779 a day. Mr Boyle, who did not receive sick pay or holidays, was one of six temps at the authority who earned more than £300 a day in 2011-12. Essex County Council, which has cut almost 1,000 workers since 2009, employed 162 interim staff costing £7.2million.  Two of the temps were paid more than £900-a-day. Matthew Sinclair of the Taxpayers Alliance said the fees for temps was an 'enormous waste of money' Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the Taxpayer's Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers will be shocked that local authorities in the county are spending so much money on interim staff. ‘Temporary staff may be needed sometimes to fill roles in the short term, but these figures suggest they are being used for far longer than that by local authorities which is an enormous waste of money. ‘Councils need to explain why these staff were needed or to take action to deliver better value for our money.’ The local authorities insisted temporary staff are needed to cover sickness and vacancies in the short-term. But Claire Wymald, Unison branch secretary for Southend, said: ‘It is a concern for us that this work has been carried out through temporary staff when it could have been done through normal staff. ‘There could have been quite a few jobs that could have been saved if the council had not been expending on these interim posts. ‘There isn't really any evidence on the contrary that this benefits the council long term, so why don't they retain staff instead?’ A Basildon Council spokesman said: ‘We employ over 1,000 staff, the vast majority of whom are contracted on either fixed term or permanent contracts. ‘However it is sometimes necessary to employ a small number of interim staff to fill critical posts that require staffing immediately whilst a recruitment process is undertaken, to fill posts that are hard to recruit to, or to manage planned absences. ‘We currently only have four interim positions, and it must be remembered that these posts would still incur a cost to the council if they were covered by contracted staff.’ Basildon, Southend and Essex County Council are being paid up to £800-a-day, costing £8million-a-year . Both Basildon and Southend Councils said that short-term staff do not get sick pay or paid leave. Southend Council’s Sue Goodwin said: ‘We use interim managers for a range of purposes across the council but we do try to use them sparingly. ‘Interims are only commissioned to provide essential specialist advice and support if the council does not have the expertise in-house. ‘The council has been working proactively to manage its use of interims and over recent years we have used a very limited number of interim managers, primarily to cover for vacancies in critical posts or where we have gone through significant change.’ Essex County Council said temps helped with the council's cost cutting programme. A said: ‘ECC has completed the first part of an ambitious programme of transformation, we have saved £360m as a result. ‘This has meant we have needed additional professional expertise and capacity in the short term in order to achieve this. ‘Interim staff can be a cost-effective way of accessing professional expertise in relation to short-term or one-off pieces of work and helps the council complete complex projects for which we have no or insufficient in-house capacity or capability. ‘Rigorous controls are in place around the recruitment of these staff, who are recruited for short periods of time in the main for less than three months.’","Essex County Council ran up £7.2million bill for 162 temporary workers .

Keith Duell, 68, is already halfway through his six-day camp on Avon Beach in Christchurch, Dorset, wrapped in four layers of clothing to withstand the cold. The grandfather hopes his hardy perseverance will secure the beach's only long-term let beach hut when it becomes available on Monday.

Indeed, his stakeout has been made all the more bearable by his wife who visits him every day bringing homemade soup. Mr Duell, a former farmer from Burley, Hampshire, has also been visited by other family members in the evening who bring him dinner.

David Gauke said he is 'pleased' with how things were going despite the confusion . Tory voters will be the hardest hit when child benefit is axed for higher earners. Figures obtained by the Daily Mail reveal that the Conservative heartlands in the South East will be the biggest losers when the changes come into force on Monday. Nine of the top ten constituencies where most letters have been sent out warning that families will lose the benefit are in Conservative safe seats in London and the Home Counties. The revelations will reinforce the concerns of some Tory MPs that the Government is gratuitously offending its own supporters with the raid on child benefit. Yesterday, the Treasury admitted more than 300,000 taxpayers – out of an estimated 1.2million who are affected – have not yet been informed by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs that they are set to lose out. Despite the confusion, Treasury Minister David Gauke insisted he was pleased with the way things were unfolding. He insisted there is no obligation to contact people and said they could always get the information from the HM Revenue and Customs website instead. The Treasury has sent out 750,000 warning letters to families saying they could be affected by the cut and warning them that they have to complete a self-assessment tax form. But with just days to go before changes to the system on January 7, only 182,199 of those affected have opted out of receiving the benefit altogether, rather than fill in self-assessment forms. Yet Mr Gauke, Exchequer secretary to the Treasury, told Sky News that this was a ‘good response’ and ‘slightly more’ than expected. He said: ‘So far we are getting a good response – slightly more  people have opted out of child  benefit than we had expected and that suggests the message is  getting across even though not  everyone will have got a letter.’ But another 316,000 families, where one parent earns at least £50,000, may have no idea that they will be stripped of part or all of the benefit. At present, all parents with young children are given the benefit worth £20.30 a week for the first child and £13.40 for each subsequent child. For a couple with two children, it is worth £1,752 a year. But from Sunday, families where one parent earns between £50,000 and £60,000 will have the handout reduced. Families where one parent earns more than £60,000 will lose the benefit entirely. Unless parents opt to stop receiving the benefit entirely, those losing all or part of it will have to fill in a tax form. Of the 750,000 letters sent out the most – 169,000 – went to households in the South East, with another 132,000 to homes in London, 92,000 to families in the East of England and 62,000 to households in the North West. At the other end of the scale, just 13,600 were sent to homes in Northern Ireland and 18,000 in the North East. Two of the top ten constituencies with most people hit by the child benefit cut are home to Tory cabinet ministers, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt in South West Surrey and Home Secretary Theresa May in Maidenhead. The constituencies of Jeremy Hunt and Theresa May are among those that will be most hit by the cut . The only non-Conservative seat in the top ten is Twickenham, held by Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable. The first constituency outside the south of England to appear on the list of 651 constituencies, in 30th place, is Altrincham and Sale West, near Manchester, which saw 3,080 letters delivered. At the bottom of the list is Glasgow North East, where just 110 homes received letters. Speaking about the households who have not yet received letters, Mr Gauke said HMRC does not have the information necessary to contact people whose circumstances have changed over the past year. Chuka Umunna said one third of recipients who will lose out on child benefit will not be told and will get a 'horrible surprise' The minister, who has previously accused critics of the child benefit cut of ‘fiscal nimbyism’, added: ‘HMRC doesn’t normally write to everybody, every time there is a tax change that affects them. If people haven’t received a letter, that doesn’t mean they can’t visit the HMRC website. ‘After Sunday, if people haven’t opted out then they’ll need to make sure they are in the self-assessment system.’ A Treasury spokesman insisted the cuts were necessary, adding: ‘We have always been clear those with the broadest shoulders should carry the greatest burden when it comes to balancing the nation’s books. ‘Those liable for the removal of child benefit fall in the top 15 per cent of earners and nearly half of the households affected by this change have a household income of more than £100,000.’ But Labour business spokesman . described it as ‘extraordinary’ that a third of current child benefit . recipients who will lose out this year will not be informed by HMRC and . are ‘going to get a horrible surprise’. He . added: ‘You’ve still got this ridiculous situation where if you are a . one-earner family where one person is earning £50,000 you lose all of . your child benefit, but if you’re a two-earner family where each of you . is earning, say, £40,000, a combined income of £80,000, you get to keep . your child benefit. This is an extraordinary state of affairs.’","Families with one parent earning more than £60,000 will lose child benefit .

At least four cats have been killed and around 15 are currently unaccounted for after a cattery where the pets were being held burned down today. The fire is thought to have started early in the morning as the result of a faulty heater in one of the animal's pens, and swiftly spread to the cattery's main building. The owner of the Pinetrees cattery in Cannock, Staffordshire revealed that four of her own pets had died in the blaze as she wept over the deaths of the animals she was looking after. Scroll down for video . Aftermath: Police and fire officers were investigating the source of a blaze at Pinetrees cattery on Friday . Staffordshire Fire and Rescue spent five hours battling the fire on Friday morning, but a spokesman said the brigade was not treating the incident as suspicious. Two of the cats survived and were treated for smoke inhalation, but of more than 20 which had been staying at the site all the rest were either found dead or were missing in the aftermath of the blaze. Proprietor Lynn Durnall was emotional as she talked about the fire which had devastated her business. 'We've contacted those involved,' she said. 'It's very hard. 'Four of the cats that died belonged to us. I'm devastated.' Struggle: 35 firefighters were needed to bring the fire at the Staffordshire site under control . Her father Patrick Johnson described the horror of waking up to the disaster, and apologised to those who had entrusted their pets to the facility. 'We woke up to the flames coming out of the skylight,' he said. 'On behalf of my daughter, who runs the cattery, I'd like to say how sorry we are, because we all love our animals.' Pinetrees offers a year-round service to pet owners, who pay from £6 a day to give their cats access to 'heated chalets' and 'diet catering'. Visitors to the cattery's website today offered a steady stream of condolences in the wake of the accident. Devastated: The cattery's owner spoke of her sadness at the loss of four of her own pets . 'So sorry to hear about the fire on the news,' one well-wisher said. 'Our thoughts are with you, praying for you as you rebuild your business and hoping the moggies that ran into the forest are found.' Another wrote: 'So sad about the news, I would like to offer my volunteer services to help re-build, look after the cats and make it a special cattery again.' Local fire chief Dermot Hogan said the brigade had sent six crews to the fire, with a total of 35 people fighting to control the blaze. 'The building has been destroyed as it was predominately a wooden structure and we’ve been unable to confirm so far how many cats have died in the fire,' he said. 'A fire investigation was carried out to establish how the fire started and we believe an electrical fault within one of the pens is to blame.'","Pinetrees cattery devastated by fire in early hours of Friday morning .

One case in Glasgow shows a man's mobile knocked to the ground and apparently smashed by an officer. Another video, filmed during an arrest in Edinburgh, shows an officer marching towards the cameraman and smacking the mobile out of the way. The man involved claimed he was arrested immediately afterwards. Scroll down for video . A clip filmed in Glasgow shows a man's mobile knocked to the ground and apparently smashed by a Strathclyde officer . The first video uploaded in June 2012 shows a Strathclyde Police officer approach a group of men in Glasgow after a girl in a nightclub claimed they 'annoyed her'. During the 9 minute-long exchange, viewed by more than 1,300 users, the officer repeatedly tells the group: 'If you annoy somebody then it is a breach of the peace'. The individuals maintained annoying someone isn't illegal but the officer replied: 'If it causes an annoyance then it is an offence'. After about two minutes the officer says the group 'caused alarm'. The policeman also stated it is illegal to film people in public at which point one of the group started their own recording. The constable then lashes out knocking the phone out his hand where it can be heard smashing on the ground. The group can be heard asking 'if it's illegal, what about the paparazzi?' and questioning why photographers can take photos and films in public, but the officer does not answer. The man, named by others in the video as 'John', said: 'Why have you done that? That's criminal damage - you broke my phone.' The police officer approached the group of men, who asked why the paparazzi are allowed to take pictures but they are not . No apology is offered to 'John' and the officer only reveals his number as A403 and that he was based at the Stewart Street station in Glasgow. A Lothian and Borders Police spokesman said: 'We intend to look in further detail at the circumstances behind this incident in order to determine whether any action is required.' They were also unable to confirm if the uploader of the video was arrested.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:17 EST, 4 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:38 EST, 4 January 2013 . A number of leading British artists including Tracey Emin have lost tens of thousands of pounds after investing in a failed West End restaurant and hotel. The St John Hotel was launched in a blaze of publicity by celebrity offal chef Fergus Henderson, but went into administration after a series of high-profile misfortunes. While the premises has remained open under a new owner, its 'ambassador shareholders' such as Ms Emin and fellow artists Peter Doig and Sarah Lucas have lost their investments in the venture. Failure: The St John Hotel was founded by offal chef Fergus Henderson, left, and Tracey Emin, right, was one of many well-known investors in the venture . The 15-room hotel was spearheaded by Mr Henderson, known as the 'king of offal', and its restaurant was so well-regarded that it was awarded a Michelin star in the autumn. But a delay in the opening date, ongoing building work outside its Leicester Square building, and the slump in the hospitality industry during the Olympics meant that it was forced into administration in October, the Evening Standard has reported. The company that owned the hotel, St John Chinatown Ltd, sold the business to a Singaporean tycoon, and the hotel and restaurant are both still open. Full details of the saga emerged for the first time in a report to creditors drawn up by administrators Tim Dolder and Trevor Binyon, of corporate restructuring firm RSM Tenon. The document shows that shareholders — many of them 'well known' friends of the founders — stumped up a total of £2.25million to back the development, on what was the site of fish restaurant Manzi’s. Loss-making venture: St John Hotel and Restaurant in Leicester Square, London, has gone into administration . Henderson, founder of St John restaurant in Smithfield, is famed for his 'nose to tail' style of cooking. When . the hotel opened he described it as 'cheeky in a nice way', with a bar . that would serve all night and a kitchen 'like an 18th century man o’ war', adding: 'The spirit of the place is ""Yes"".' But . the administrators’ report reveals that the owners had already suffered . a disastrous catalogue of setbacks since first drawing up their plans . in 2007. They hired staff and took guest bookings for Christmas 2010 after the builders said the hotel would be ready in time. Michelin star: But the well-regarded restaurant was not enough to stop the company going into administration . In fact it was not fit to open until April 2011, and even then, further 'snagging' problems meant that only half of the rooms could be used. As a result the hotel lost £1.4million in its first trading year. In addition, Westminster council’s lengthy makeover of Leicester Square meant that 'builders' materials and site waste was regularly found outside of the premises, and at times the only view from the restaurant windows was that of the construction works.' The restaurant was also unable to use its outdoor seating terrace. Tough economic conditions, exacerbated . by the 'negative impact' on restaurants caused by the Olympics, pushed . the hotel into insolvency on 19 October, after the directors decided . they did not want to provide any extra funding. Involved: Sarah Lucas, left, and Peter Doig, right, also invested in the venture before its failure . The hotel is now out of administration under its new ownership.  It has remained open and traded profitably since October, with occupancy rates close to 90 per cent. However, a £2.98million shortfall at St John Chinatown Ltd means the original shareholders are unlikely to get their money back. They also included gallery owner Sadie Coles, ceramicist Jane Hamlyn, American painter Elizabeth Peyton, Littlewoods heir and art collector James Moores, and writer Guy Kennaway. Trevor Gulliver said they were being 'very supportive' despite the probable loss of their investments. He added: 'They are all grown ups, no one put in millions or hundreds of thousands.' The rest of the St John restaurant group was unaffected by the administration, he said. 'Everyone is quietly working through what has been a very difficult process to protect jobs and suppliers. The restaurant is still cooking well and the hotel is busy. It has improved the streetscape and it will still be a happy and successful building in 10, 20, 30 years time.' The new owner is Loh Lik Peng, a Singaporean hotelier who also owns a venue converted from Bethnal Green Town Hall. He bought St John Hotel for an undisclosed sum.","Top artists invested in Fergus Henderson's St John Hotel in the West End .

Jailed: Kevin Sherwood has been sentenced to 12 months in prison for defrauding two elderly couples . A fraudulent roofer has joined his two sons on a list of rogue traders after he was found guilty of conning £37,000 out of two elderly couples. Kevin Sherwood was sentenced to 12 months in prison and given an ASBO stopping him from taking advantage of pensioners. His sons, Danny and Kevin Jr, previously escaped jail despite being found guilty of ripping off elderly homeowners by charging hundreds of pounds for work they had offered to carry out for a token sum. Sherwood, 53, was hired by one couple to fix the fascias and soffits at their home, but managed to convince them the entire roof needed replacing. Edward Longcroft, 89, and his 81-year-old wife Barbara handed Sherwood £25,000 in savings which they had saved in case they ever needed to go into care. The workman went on to dupe a second couple out of £12,000 for unnecessary repairs to their roof of their bungalow home. He even drove his 85-year-old victim Alan Read to the bank five times to withdraw the money to pay for the job. The police were informed when Mr Read's son-in-law returned home from holiday to find him on the verge of a nervous breakdown over the scam. Sherwood, from Bournemouth, was found guilty of defrauding Mr Read and partner Margaret Williamson, 82. He was jailed for 12 months by a judge at Bournemouth Crown Court, who slammed him for taking advantage of an elderly couple. He also pleaded guilty to four charges brought by his local trading standards department for breaching building regulations during his work on the Longcrofts' home. Scam: Sherwood's sons Danny, left, and Kevin Jr, right, have also been convicted of conning pensioners . Mr Read said afterwards: 'I feel such a fool and an idiot really. I got sucked in, it was the biggest mistake of my life.' Mrs Williamson, a retired schoolteacher, added: 'I was disgusted that we had been taken in, it was awful.' Mrs Longcroft said: 'One of us will probably have to go into care and the money we spent should have been used for that. 'We get no compensation for what he has done to us and this is no deterrent to other cowboy builders out there.' 'I feel such a fool': Margaret Williamson and Alan Read spoke of their shame at being conned by Sherwood . Sherwood committed his crimes in September 2011 - five months after his son Kevin Jr tried to trick a vulnerable pensioner out of thousands of pounds after convincing him his garage roof was dangerous. He turned up at his victim's house one morning and offered to fix some tiles which had mysteriously fallen off in return for £50. Eventually, he charged the elderly man £3,700 for the straightforward work. He was given a nine-month suspended prison sentence and ordered to carry out 200 hours of community service. Later that year, his brother Danny, 29, avoided prison over a similar con after pleading guilty to carrying out work that was unnecessary. Duped: Edward and Barbara Longcroft gave Sherwood the money they had saved in case they needed care . He had told an 86-year-old woman he could fix a tile on her roof for a 'fiver'. But he later claimed the work was far more extensive than he thought, and took £80 in cash from her as well as a cheque for £700. In addition to being jailed, Sherwood Sr was given a five-year ASBO, requiring him to notify trading standards before entering into a contract with anybody aged over 75. Detective Constable Martin Farrington, of Dorset Police, said: 'Kevin Sherwood took advantage of a vulnerable elderly victim. 'I hope that this sentence sends a clear message that such actions will not be tolerated.'Andy Sherriff, trading standards manager at Bournemouth council, said: 'Mr Sherwood and his family are well known to us and his sons have been dealt with before.'","Kevin Sherwood sentenced to 12 months in prison after claiming thousands of pounds from elderly customers .

Tragedy: Dana Ferrari, 28, was struck by a train on the no.2 train track at 34th street on New Year's day in the early hours of the morning . The family and boyfriend of a young New Jersey women who was killed by a subway train after stumbling onto the tracks on New Year's day are reeling in shock with unanswered questions as to how she ended up there. Dana Ferrari, 28, a pediatrician's office employee, had travelled to Madison Square Garden with fiancé Blake Pupo and his brother to see a Phish concert on New Year's Eve but disappeared in the middle of the night's festivities. Witnesses at the 34th street subway station say they saw Miss Ferrari in the early hours of the morning staggering around the no.2 line platform before stepping onto the track and lying down. The New York Post reports that . according to law enforcement officials, it was too late by the time the . driver saw her and she was struck by the train just after 5 a.m. The . horrific news comes just days after an unsuspecting man was shoved . under a Manhattan subway train by a mumbling woman in a horrific hate . crime, and just weeks after a homeless man pushed a Queens father-of-one . onto the tracks after an altercation on the platform. According to the victim's sister, Leslie . Ferrari, 22, of Andover, Mr Pupo went to the bathroom during the . concert and when he returned his fiancée had gone. 'He’s a mess,' she told the Post. 'We’d like to have more answers. How did she get into the train station?' Family members cannot make sense of . the unspeakable tragedy, seeing no reason that Miss Ferrari would take . her own life. Her sister recalls a text message she sent to her at . midnight that read: 'happy new year! i love you'.

Dana Ferrari was identified by the CVS loyalty card attached to her keys that belonged to Mr Pupo. Train death: Witnesses saw Miss Ferrari staggering about the No. 2 subway platform at Penn Station 34th Street where she allegedly walked onto the track and lay down . Stumbling: Despite reports that the victim appeared intoxicated, the city Medical Examiner's Office is still investigating the bizarre tragedy . Raised in Newton, New Jersey, she had been engaged to Mr Pupo since 2009 and had lived in Dingman's Ferry, Pennsylvania with him and their dog. While her sister said that the medical examiner informed the family that the death was being treated as an accident, Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the city Medical Examiner’s Office, said the cause of death was still listed as 'pending further study.' 'We are doing testing and further investigation,' including toxicology tests, she told the New York Post. Loss: Dana (right) worked with her sister, Leslie (left) who said she had no reason to suspect anything was bothering her sister or that she would take her own life .

And in an attempt to stamp out one of the game's last remaining stigmas, a Premiership star has become only the third footballer to appear on the cover of the UK's leading gay magazine. West Ham United winger Matt Jarvis features on the front of February's Attitude and claims the sport is more than ready to welcome any footballing stars wanting to come out. Speaking out: In an attempt to stamp out one of the game's last remaining stigmas, Premiership footballer Matt Jarvis has become only the third footballer to appear on the cover of the UK's leading gay magazine . Optimism: Matt Jarvis, left, is pictured in action against Norwich City on New Year's Day. He claims the sport is more than ready to welcome any footballing stars wanting to come out . The married 26-year-old's appearance on the front of the magazine follows on from David Beckham and Freddie Ljungberg, who both appeared in the previous decade. Jarvis believes there would be no issue should any footballers decide to come out. 'It's everyday life,' he said. 'It's not something that's going to be a shock. 'I'm sure there are many footballers who are gay, but when they decide to actually come out and say it, it is a different story. 'It's one that I'm sure they've thought about many times. But it's a hard thing for them to do.' Jarvis feels the mechanisms are in place to help out any player who chose to take what would be a pioneering step. Stars: The married 26-year-old's appearance on the front of the magazine follows on from David Beckham, left, and Freddie Ljungberg, right, who both appeared in the previous decade . 'There'd be support everywhere within the football community, whether it be players, fans or within the PFA [Professional Footballers' Association],' he said. 'There would definitely be groups of people who would be supportive and help them through it.' No professional footballer has come out publicly in Britain since Justin Fashanu in 1990. Worrying: No professional footballer has come out publicly in Britain since Justin Fashanu in 1990 . The former Norwich, Hearts and Nottingham Forest player killed himself eight years later. The prejudices he faced after coming out as gay were cited at the inquest into his death. Changes in attitudes within football were highlighted following a recent study by the University of Staffordshire which suggested the majority of fans would welcome players coming out as gay. The study, as reported by The Independent, found that 40 per cent of fans blamed clubs and agents for keeping gay footballers under wraps. Attitude's editor, Matthew Todd, however, believes football has a problem with homophobia and needs to tackle it in the same way it is with racism. 'It's ridiculous that there are no openly gay players in professional football,' Todd said. 'There's rightly been a focus on ridding the beautiful game of racism, but there doesn't seem to be much effort to tackle homophobia. 'We know there are gay players – and fans who support the game religiously – so I hope this starts a discussion and is a small step in the right direction.'","Matt Jarvis features on the front of February's Attitude .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:15 EST, 4 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:24 EST, 4 January 2013 . Terrorist: Anwar al-Awlaki before he was killed last year . Within days of the 9/11 terrorist attacks the FBI suspected  American Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki had booked flights for the hijackers. The reason for the flights remains unclear, but 9/11 Commission report later noted that . the hijackers had used flights in the run-up to the attacks to test . security and surveillance. Awlaki, who was born in New Mexico, . had become the lead figure for al-Qaeda and the offshoot al-Qaeda in the . Arabian Peninsula in the years after Osama bin Laden went into hiding. 'We have FBI documents showing that the . FBI knew that al-Awlaki had bought three tickets for three of the . hijackers to fly into Florida and into Las Vegas, including the lead . hijacker, Mohammad Atta' Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, told Fox News. He . explained that the records seen by the news station, show the cleric 'was a central focus of the . FBI's investigation of 9/11. They show he wasn't cooperative. And they . show that he was under surveillance.' One . FBI investigative report indicates a credit transaction for 'Atta, . Mohammed -- American West Airlines, 08/13/2001, Washington, DC to Las . Vegas to Miami.' According to the Joint Congressional Inquiry into . 9/11, the . mid-August flight, was one of Atta’s numerous . and crucial surveillance flights. The CIA went on to assassinate al-Awlaki . in a drone attack because he was known to have preached to the 9/11 . hijackers and his videos were found across Britain in terrorist homes . and in an extreme bookshop used by the 7/7 attackers. Before his death, he was believed to . be responsible for persuading Nigerian terrorist Omar Farouk . Abdulmuttalab to conceal explosives in his underwear which he tried to . use to blow up a Detroit-bound plane on December 25th, 2009. He also played a role in the 2009 . Fort Hood massacre and the failed plot by Faisal Shahzad to detonate an . SUV filled with explosives on May 1, 2010. Relaisation: The FBI suspected within days of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that the American Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki may booked flights for the 9/11 hijackers . Other individuals identified by Fox News through the report show a credit card record for Satam al-Suqami who was one of the muscle hijackers on American Airlines . Flight 11, which slammed into the World Trade Center on Sept. 11 and “W. al-Sheri -- National Airlines, 08/01/2001, San Francisco to Las . Vegas to Miami.” This could be either of the al-Shehri brothers - Waleed and Wail -  the pair were also hijackers, according to the . 9/11 Commission report. Last month an MI6 agent who managed . to infiltrate al-Qaeda in a bid to kill Anwar al-Awlaki revelaed how he . was told by his British bosses they would not assassinate him because it . could be against the law. Terrorist . Anwar al-Awlaki was encouraging attacks on the West and also recruiting . young Muslims to carry them out but despite being able to murder him . Morten Storm was blocked by London, it has emerged. Storm . says he was told by his bosses in the UK: 'We do not involve ourselves . in encouraging people to participate in jihad and we don’t involve . ourselves in killings abroad. Our objective is to gather intelligence.' British secret services then cut Storm off completely when he approached the Americans instead, he has claimed. Claims: MI6 spy Morten Storm could have killed terrorist leader Anwar al-Awlaki but Britain said no, he says . A source told the Daily Telegraph that no spy can kill anyone without permission from the Foreign Secretary. Advice . says 'Lethal force' can only be used in those circumstances in an . 'emergency or crisis which causes danger to the UK or its citizens' - . which means it has not been used for decades, the source added. Storm . and al-Awlaki, who was a U.S. citizen and lived in the UK for two . years, became so close he was offered $250,000 by the CIA to find a wife . for Awlaki - who already had two - in an effort to track him down . To do this, Storm turned to Facebook, and found 'Aminah' - who said she was a fan of Awlaki. He . then orchestrated an exchange of video messages between the two, and - . despite an assassination order on Awlaki from the U.S. - they agreed to . marry. But while successful in its early stages, the rest of the CIA's plot was thwarted. Storm suffered a troubled childhood, drifting through drugs and into crime. In 1997, the Dane said that he converted in prison to Islam and upon leaving moved to Yemen to study the Koran. He added that in 2000 he married a Yemeni woman with whom he had a son named Osama. It is understood in 2006, he had a dramatic and unexplained change of heart and was turned double agent by the Danish intelligence service, PET. When Fox News asked the FBI for comment . on the documents Bureau spokeswoman Kathleen Wright said: 'The FBI . cautions against drawing conclusions from redacted FOIA documents.'","Reason for the flights is unclear, but 9/11 Commission report later noted that the hijackers had used flights in the lead-up to the attacks .

Under fire: BBC Trust finance chief Anthony Fry has rejected a request to hand the emails to MPs and has not read them himself . The BBC is facing pressure from MPs to publish emails that could show the broadcaster gave the opportunity to two of its performers to avoid tax. The messages came to light in an independent report into the corporation’s tax arrangements late last year following concerns about it paying some individuals through ‘personal service companies’. A Deloitte review carried out on behalf of the BBC found the broadcaster had taken into account ‘a range of tax outcomes’ for two people who were paid via personal service companies. It also criticised ‘inconsistency’ in the BBC’s approach to pay. It pointed out individuals with similar jobs were being paid in three different ways: some as staff, some as freelancers and others via the controversial companies. The BBC conceded the personal service deals gave ‘greater opportunity’ for avoiding tax and National Insurance payments. Since the report there has been pressure on the broadcaster to reveal what was in the ‘range of tax outcomes’ emails. The messages are understood to contain advice from one or more of its tax advisers. It is thought they were sent to BBC managers who were negotiating contracts with presenters. Conservative MP Richard Bacon, who sits on the Public Accounts Committee, said: ‘The issue is one about trust at the end of the day.’ He added: ‘If they have got nothing to hide then why keep them private… they could always redact the names, it is the information people are after.’ Stars: Broadcasters (left to right) Jeremy . Paxman, Chris Moyles, Emily Maitlis and Fiona Bruce are all thought to . have been paid via controversial service companies, but emails linked to . the practice won't be released . In comments to another newspaper he . added: ‘The emails should also be published because sunlight is the best . disinfectant. Public trust has fallen in the BBC and the best way to . restore it is to be open.’ Anthony Fry, chairman of the BBC . Trust’s finance committee, has so far resisted the call to reveal what . is in the emails. He has also not read the emails in question. At the end of last year, the BBC said . that more than 100 performers should be added to its books to avoid . suspicions of tax avoidance. It also said it would move away from its . policy of employing many of its on-air stars through their own service . companies. In the report the BBC had identified . 131 employees – either currently paid via the service companies or on . freelance contracts – who would be asked to go on the payroll and be . taxed at source. Refusal: The BBC paid Deloitte to trawl through the emails and they say they are happy there was nothing of note in them . This could mean stars such as Fiona Bruce and Jeremy Paxman are told to become employees. There is no suggestion either has used personal service companies to avoid paying tax. But it emerged that the broadcaster . faces a bitter battle with high-profile stars over plans to add them to . the staff payroll. Performers will be subjected to an ‘employment test’ to see if they have the ‘characteristics’ of a BBC staff member. A BBC Trust spokesman said: ‘Tax experts Deloitte were engaged to carry out a comprehensive review. ‘The Trust is satisfied that Deloitte . reviewed everything in the round, including the documents referred to, . and concluded that there was no evidence of tax avoidance and more . generally a high level of tax compliance.’","Corporation refuses request from MPs to see correspondence between BBC tax advisers and staff .
