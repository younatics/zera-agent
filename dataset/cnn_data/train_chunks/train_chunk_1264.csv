"There are already devices that track your steps, weight and calories, but the latest gadget flips health tracking on its head by monitoring how many cigarettes you have. Instead of encouraging people to smoke more, the smart lighter has been designed to shame them into quitting by revealing the true extent of their habit. Called Quitbit, the device resembles a Zippo lighter and each time it’s used, it records the number of cigarettes the user has had and how long it’s been since they last lit up. The Quitbit smart lighter, pictured, was created by a pair of Boston-based designers and resembles a Zippo lighter. Each time it is used, Quitbit tracks the number of cigarettes an owner smokes on a small LED, pictured, and will also flag up how long it's been since the user last lit up . Size: 2.6in x 1.6in x 0.4in (67 x 43 x 10 mm) Battery: Rechargeable Lithium Polymer; lasts one week, or a pack a day . Weight: 72g . Connectivity: Bluetooth Low Energy (4.0) Compatibility: iOS 5 and later and Android 4.3 and later . Prices: Kickstarter prices begin at $79 (£46), but Quitbit is expected to retail for $149 (£88) when it goes on sale in June . A companion app will also track this data over longer periods of time, and can be used to set goals. This app can also reveal how much money has been spent on cigarettes, or subsequently saved by cutting back, and helps smokers learn at what times during the day they are smoking the most. Progress can then be shared with Quitbit's community or with friends on Facebook and Twitter. Quitbit was created by Boston-based designer Ata Ghofrani. It lights cigarettes using a heating element, similar to car lighters, and the electronics count each cigarette that is lit. The lighter will also flag up how long it's been since the user last lit up, pictured. Quitbit lights cigarettes using a heating element, similar to car lighters. The developers claim the Quitbit will only track the user's smoking, meaning flicking the lighter or sharing it with friends won't impact the tracking . A small LED display on the front of the Quitbit shows the number of cigarettes, and the duration since the last cigarette. Ghofrani said he developed the Quitbit to only track the owner's smoking, meaning flicking the lighter or sharing it with friends won’t impact the tracking. He did not explain how the device does this, however. The lighter can also be put on a timer, . or programmed to work for set periods to help smokers cut back during . the day, for example. Quitbit, pictured, uses Bluetooth and is compatible with iPhone 4S, 5, 5S and Android 4.3 and above. Its rechargeable Lithium Polymer battery lasts one week, or a pack a day . A companion app, pictured, also tracks smoking data over longer periods of time and can be used to set goals, pictured left.

Quitbit uses Bluetooth and is compatible with iPhone 4S, 5, 5S and Android 4.3 and above. The Quitbit team was founded by Ghofrani and Kuji Nakano. The pair said: ‘[We] had the idea behind Quitbit when Ghofrani was trying to quit smoking last year. ‘When smoking before class, Nakano asked Ghofrani how much he smoked that day. ‘When he wasn’t sure [we] started to track their smoking and became frustrated with the existing ways to learn about their smoking habits.’ The pair have set up a Kickstarter campaign to fund production of the Quitbit. They are looking to raise $50,000 (£29,600) by 11 June and have currently achieved just over $10,300 (£6,100).","The Quitbit was created by a pair of Boston-based designers .

"Police are revealing more details about the grisly murder of four women in a Tulsa, Oklahoma, apartment yesterday, but admitted that they are not close to a suspect. Each of the women - including 23-year-old twins, had been shot to death in the crime-ridden neighborhood. The twins were identified as Rebeika Powell and Kayetie Melchor, and the other victims were Misty Nunley, 33; and Julie Jackson, 55. Innocent: Police lead two children to a police car after an unidentified 4-year-old was found unharmed among the dead bodies of four women . On scene: Sgt. Dave Walker, head of the Tulsa Police Department's homicide unit, leads an investigation into the mysterious deaths . Police initially said the victims were in their late teens and early 20s and that the boy who survived was age 4. Aside from the twins, did not say how the women knew each other or if they were related. Detectives and officers were 'beating the bushes' to figure out what happened, police spokesman Leland Ashley said Monday. He added: 'Right now, we have no clear-cut suspect. I don't want to strike fear in the community tonight, but we do have an individual or individuals who murdered four people. Do we know if there was a motive, like a jealous lover? We don't know that. We can't say if it was random or if someone knew [the victims].' According to reports, police and EMS . workers were called to the apartment near 61st Street and Peoria Avenue . at 12:36 p.m. after an unidentified person stumbled across the corpses. Heartland: Police told reporters that such violent crimes as uncommon to the Oklahoma city . At the run-down apartment complex, bed sheets or cardboard hang as improvised draperies in many windows behind a black wrought-iron gate. The guard shack is empty and signs read 'Curfew 10 p.m. for everyone, everyday' and 'Photo ID required to be on property.' Three of the units are burned out and boarded up with plywood. Riverwood has long been plagued by crime, and Tulsa police say there were two murders in the Fairmont Terrace Apartments in 2012. Residents say gunfire and break-ins are part of the pattern of their everyday lives. 'We're in the eye of the storm,' says Charles Burke, a 48-year-old construction worker. 'You're on your toes. You can't be too careful.' Neighbor Jamie Kramer, a 28-year-old mother of two young children, has lived at the apartment complex for 10 years. She said the crime seems to come in cycles and that things had been pretty quiet for several months until Monday. 'It escalates and goes back down, it escalates and it goes back down,' she says. 'Usually, it's bad when it gets hot.' Mystery: Officers have canvassed the area for witnesses but have yet to determine a motive or lead . Neighbor Ladawn Mack, a 25-year-old cashier, says she's used to seeing police cars in the street, and that Monday's quadruple homicide is enough to make her take extra precautions. 'We have a house alarm and I've always had a gun for my home,' Mack said. Resident Alexis Draite, 20, recently moved to Tulsa from Oklahoma City, believing it to be safer. Her strategy for staying alive: 'Lock the doors, lock the cars and don't stay outside longer than you need to.' 'The victims were shot multiple times,' Tulsa Police Officer Jillian Roberson told NBC News. Police immediately began canvassing the area trying to find any witnesses to the crime, aside from the child who is believed to have been in the residence when the shooting occurred.

"Sergio Aguero's father has revealed that the Manchester City striker 'would love to go to Barcelona' amid Spanish media reports that the Catalans have launched a £31million bid. Barcelona hope to tie up a deal for the 47-cap Argentina international and know that their opening offer is likely to be rebuffed outright by City. But new Barcelona head coach Luis Enrique is a keen admirer of Aguero and he will insist that the Catalans return with a higher bid if a deal could potentially be struck, according to Spanish website Sport.

Keen: New Barcelona head coach Luis Enrique is an admirer of Aguero and is driving the Catalans' bid . Aguero, 25, has a great relationship with Barcelona star Lionel Messi and Enrique is hopeful they can soon be club team-mates as well as fellow Argentine internationals. With Aguero under contract at City until 2017, the club would be unlikely to even consider selling their prize asset for anything less than the £36m they paid for him in July 2011. Aguero enjoyed a fine season at the Etihad despite injury, scoring an impressive 28 goals in 34 appearances as he helped City win the Premier League and the Capital One Cup double. Star: Aguero scored 28 goals in 34 games last season as Man City won the Premier League and League Cup . Dream team: Aguero could soon be in the same side as fellow Argentine Lionel Messi at Barcelona . And his father Leonel del Castillo does not believe that Manuel Pellegrini will allow his star striker to leave for the club he has always wanted to represent, such is his importance to the side. He told Spanish newspaper AS: 'He would love to go to Barcelona but Manchester City will make it impossible (for Aguero to go).'","Aguero's father claims his son has always wanted to play for Barcelona .

"Manchester City have tabled an opening bid of around £17million for Roma’s unsettled centre-back Mehdi Benatia, according to reports in Italy. The 27-year-old Morocco international is one of two alternatives City have lined up if they decide against pursuing first-choice target Eliaquim Mangala from FC Porto. And it appears the deal has progressed in the past 48 hours with reports that the Premier League champions have discussed personal terms with Benatia before making an initial approach to his club. Head boy: Manchester City have reportedly tabled a bid for Roma defender Mehdi Benatia (centre) Earlier this week the player hit out at Roma’s pay increase offer of £2.5m-a-year, with sources claiming that it is £1m-a-year less than he has been promised at City. Benatia has accused the Italians of reneging on an agreement made when he signed from Udinese for £10.5m last summer that guaranteed him a significant pay rise if Roma qualified for the Champions League. Barcelona and Bayern Munich have also been linked with Benatia who has refused to rule out a move despite having four years left on his current deal. First choice: Eliaquim Mangala is also on Manchester City's wanted list . ‘Roma have not kept their promises,’ he . said earlier this week. ‘They had told me that they would make me a new . contract offer if I had a great season. ‘But I have received an unacceptable proposal, less than €3m-per-season. I replied that I would not sign it. ‘I'm in love with Rome, I’m fine here but my mistake was to be too correct with the club and too honest. Undecided: Benatia has said he could leave Roma . ‘I never said that I wanted to leave. I only said that anyone dreams of teams like Real, Bayern and City. ‘My agent is doing his job, I could leave but I could also stay and finish my career in Roma. But I was disappointed with Roma – I deserved more respect.’ With City restricted by a £49m net transfer spend this summer as a result of breaching Financial Fair Play regulations, Benatia represents a cheaper option than Mangala who indicated recently that he would prefer a move to London with Chelsea. City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak has promised to move quickly on the club’s targets and Benatia is known to be on the list of possibilities. Roma insist he is not for sale and they do not need the money after qualifying for the Champions League this season on the back of selling Erik Lamela to Tottenham for £30m and Marquinhos – the player Benatia replaced – to Paris Saint Germain for £27m last summer. The club are expected to make their position clear at a press conference on Saturday.","Mehdi Benatia among Manchester City's transfer targets .

"It may have been hailed as one of the greatest achievements in human history, but that hasn't stopped internet pranksters poking fun at the Rosetta comet landing. Within hours of the Philae probe landing on the surface of comet 67P, social media users were busy mocking the European Space Agency's achievement. Using images from Bruce Wills film Armageddon, the Star Wars movies, and TV series The Clangers, internet users made light of the historic moment. What's the fuss about: Twitter users pointed out that while Philae may have landed on a comet two days ago, Bruce Willis landed on an asteroid way back in 1998 in the film Armageddon . Slam dunk: One internet prankster noticed and uncanny resemblance between the Philae probe as it detached from Rosetta, and this famous silhouette of Michael Jordan . We have a problem: This joker imagined the Rosetta probe encountering the rock-eating space worm found living on a comet in original Star Wars trilogy . One Twitter user also noticed an uncanny resemblance between a picture of the Philae probe disappearing into space and the famous silhouette of Michael Jordan going for a slam dunk. Twitter also saw the birth of the hashtag 'We can land on a comet but we can't...' mocking the comparatively simple milestones humanity has yet to pass. Included on the list was the ability to 'make Youtube to play after we lock our smartphone screen', 'order a McDonald's breakfast after 10.30am', and 'convince the check-out there's nothing unexpected in the bagging area'. Dropped a clanger: These early images of Philae landing on seem to suggest The Clangers was less a children's TV show, and more of a factual documentary . Spot the difference: One internet user points out the similarity between Philae and a cement mixer . You broke it: The craft carrying the Philae probe is pictured orbiting that picture of Kim Kardashian . And in line with her mission to 'break the internet' over the last few days, one image showed the Rosetta craft orbiting around Kim Kardashian's posterior. Scenes of wild celebration inside the ESA headquarters also provided web users with a source of amusement, with one fist-pumping scientist attracting a lot of attention. Dr Matt Taylor's eye-catching arm tattoos and odd dress sense also attracted a lot of attention online, though not all of it was positive, with some criticising his shirt as offensive to women. This scientist also got a lot of chuckles out of people on Twitter after the landing . Achievement: While the internet was suitably impressed with the feat of landing a probe on a comet millions of miles from Earth, some took the time to point out the lesser milestones we have yet to pass . Although there are plenty of Rosetta parodies circulating on the internet, the online community has been unusually reserved in its mockery, perhaps because the actual images coming from the Philae probe are so incredible, or because tech-savvy users are still in awe of space exploration. As for Philae itself, scientists are still puzzling over the best way to keep the probe alive after it failed to latch on to the comet on its first approach, bounced, and landed in a cave. To make matters worse, the probe is currently on its side, with one leg pointing out into space, meaning its main solar panels are without access to sunlight. Toying around: Another Twitter poster imagined what the Philae probe would look like made out of Lego - and it's surprisingly similar to the original . Dr Matt Taylor attracted a lot of comments online for his tattoo sleeves and bizarre fashion sense - thought his shirt did attract criticism for being offensive to women . Scientists now have 24 hours to figure out a way to get Philae upright before the probe battery dies, or risk putting it into hibernation until the comet comes closer to the sun in a few months. The team are considering using a 'hop' manoeuvre in order to right the probe, but gravity on 67P is several hundred thousand times weaker than on Earth, so the probe could bounce off into space. In the meantime, scientists have begun deploying instruments, have received data from temperature probes, and are planning to deploy a drill 'in very risky conditions' to collect soil samples. Philae is currently resting on its side on comet 67P causing a huge problem for scientists as its two main solar panels are in the shade, meaning it is running out of power . The team operating Philae now face either putting the probe into hibernation until the comet comes closer to the sun, or attempting a 'hop' manoeuvre in order to get it upright .","Philae probe landed on comet 67P two days ago after decade-long mission .

"Sheffield United left themselves open to more criticism on Friday night after their co-chairman said he was ‘angry and upset’ that they had been forced to withdraw their offer to allow convicted rapist Ched Evans to train with them. The League One club bowed to pressure on Thursday after their decision to welcome back their former striker sparked a furore, with Jessica Ennis-Hill demanding her name be removed from a stand at Bramall Lane should the club re-sign Evans, and four high-profile patrons resigning. But co-chairman Jim Phipps reignited the controversy on Friday night when he argued the decision was unfair on Evans, who was released from prison last month having served half of a five-year sentence for raping a woman in a hotel room. ‘I’m angry we are not able to get a chance to do for this footballer what should be done,’ said Phipps. Sheffield United chief Jim Phipps said mob-like behaviour prevented Ched Evans training with the Blades . Sheffield United co-chairman believes that the decision to do a U-turn is a defeat for principles . ‘I’m upset that we are not able to do what we wanted to do, but I acknowledge that my view is not the only view. My principles and the board’s principles are not the only thing that matter. ‘The influence of mob-like behaviour has made it difficult to take the simple step of allowing Ched to train. I will acknowledge that our decision to not let Ched train is probably a decision that will make it harder for him to get on with his football career. ‘The people who believe Ched should be punished for the rest of his life might call that a victory. I think of it as a defeat for the principle that punishment under the justice system should be left to those that are authorised by law. Jessica Ennis-Hill wanted her name removed from the stand named after her if Evans was offered a deal . Charlie Webster also stated on the BBC's Panorama that she would stand down as a patron of the club on the . Olympian Ennis-Hill (right) was one of the patrons of the club who openly criticised the club . ‘We are a community and family club and we had our people at each others’ throats and the promise was that things weren’t going to get better.’ Phipps’ view is sure to anger the supporters who took a stand over Evans, not to mention more than 150,000 people who signed a petition opposing the Welsh international striker’s return to football. Evans will receive support from the Professional Footballers’ Association in trying to find a club. Having made an application to the criminal cases review commission for an appeal against his conviction, it could be Evans has to wait until after that process has been completed. But in a statement the PFA insisted 25-year-old Evans has the right to ‘return to the job he is trained to do’. ‘We fully understand the opposing views to Ched’s return and clearly part of the issue related to him returning to the club he was previously with at the time of his imprisonment,’ said the statement. ‘It may be of benefit for Ched to look for a different club. ‘We do not agree society should impose different rules for footballers which go beyond the position of the law.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Convicted rapist Ched Evans was banned from training with former side .

"Women are having children later in life because they are spending longer in education, according to research. Finishing full-time education and training at an older average age is the main reason why people are having their first child later in life, scientists said. Researchers from the University of Southampton looked at women in Britain and France to try and explain the fertility trend. Career-minded: Finishing full-time education and training at an older average age is the main reason why people are having their first child later in life . Professor Maire Ni Bhrolchain, who conducted the study with Dr Eva Beaujouan, said: 'Later childbearing has been a major feature of fertility trends in recent decades, both in Britain and other developed countries. 'A large number of explanations have been suggested for the trend towards later parenthood, but our study is the first to show that the major influencing factor is that people have been staying on longer in education and training.' The average age of a woman having her first child in 2004 was 27, three years later than in 1974, when the average age was 24, the researchers said. During these three decades, young men and woman were progressively staying longer at school and also going into further and higher education in greater numbers - with women completing their education or training at an increasingly later age. In the late 1970s, young women were leaving full-time education or training at an average age of 18, but by 2004 this had risen by two years to an average age of 20. Professor Ni Bhrolchain said: 'The data we have examined shows that, in the past several decades, young people have been starting their full adult lives around two years later on average than in the recent past and this has meant family life starting later too.' The Southampton study focused on the period between the early 1980s and the late 1990s, during which time the mean age of women having their first birth rose by almost one-and-a-half years. During the same period, the time between women leaving full-time education and a first birth rose by only 0.6 years. This means that about three-fifths of the change in age at first birth in Britain is due to more time being spent in education and training. The figure is four-fifths in France. So longer education and training is the most important explanation for later childbearing, although not the only one. There are other contributory factors, the study claimed. Professor Ni Bhrolchain said: 'If we start the clock when young women leave full-time education or training, the delay to motherhood, compared across the decades, is much less than looking purely at the differences in their ages at their first birth.' To investigate the study, the researchers compiled and analysed data in Britain from the General Household Survey and in France from the Family History Survey. The study, called Fertility Postponement, is largely due to rising educational enrolment, is published in the journal Population Studies.","Finishing full-time education and training at an older average age is the main reason why people are having their first child later in life .

"Convicted rapist Ched Evans will not be returning to Sheffield United after the club retracted its decision to allow him to start training with them . Sheffield United have said convicted rapist Ched Evans will not be returning to train at the club following public outcry over the decision. Presenter Charlie Webster quit as a club patron over the decision, Jessica Ennis-Hill asked for her name to be removed from one of the club's stands, and two shirt sponsors had threatened to walk. Evans was released from jail last month after serving half of a five-year sentence for rape, but has refused to apologise to his victim or accept his guilt. In a statement, Sheffield United said: 'After ongoing and extensive deliberation, Sheffield United Football Club has decided to retract the opportunity for its former player, Ched Evans, to use the Club's facilities for training purposes, as was previously intended. 'The Club initially accepted a request from The PFA for Ched Evans to be able to train. The reaction to this has been at an intensity that could not have been anticipated when first announced. 'As noted in previous statements from the Club, the legal system of this country provides for both the punishment and the rehabilitation of every person who has been found guilty of a crime. 'Sheffield United will not be used to promote the view that professional footballers should be treated differently, as has been the wont of certain sections of the media and various commentators. 'In addition, we remain disappointed at some of the inaccurate reporting, misinformed views and commentary, as well as the actions of a minority of individuals on social media. 'Professional footballers must be treated as equals before the law. 'The club condemns rape and violence of any kind against women in the strongest possible terms. 'The club is aware that Ched Evans is pursuing legal recourse via the Criminal Cases Review Commission in the determination he has to clear his name. 'We trust that he will be afforded a fair hearing.' Scroll down for video . Presenter Charlie Webster (left) quit as a patron of the club after Ched Evans was allowed to start training again, while Jessica Ennis-Hill asked for her name to be removed from one of the stands . Speaking to MailOnline, Roz Hardie the chief executive officer of campaign group Object, said: 'We congratulate Sheffield United for listening to public opinion and reversing their previous decision. 'Ched Evans is an unrepentant convicted rapist . Footballers are critical role models for young men and women in particular. 'Offenders have a right to rehabilitation but Ched Evans had been set to return to top flight football when he has shown no remorse for his crime. 'Indeed he has used his profile to persistently claim his 'innocence' in the media and re-traumatise his own and many other victims.' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who is MP for Sheffield Hallam, tweeted: 'A sensible decision by Sheffield United regarding Ched Evans. Step in the right direction.' Charlie Webster, who resigned as a patron during the row, wrote on Twitter: 'Sheffield United have done the right thing by not letting Ched Evans train with them. It's the right thing for the club, its fans, its community and the victim. '(Sheffield United) is a great club with a fantastic history and now its future can be fantastic too.' Evans was accused of rape in 2011 after having sex with a 19-year-old woman, who cannot be identified, at a hotel near his home town of Rhyl, Denbighshire. Fellow footballer Clayton McDonald took the woman back to the hotel room before texting Evans, who arrived later. Evans had tried to claim the intercourse was consensual but a jury found otherwise. Mr McDonald was cleared of the same charge. Evans' girlfirend Natasha Massey (right), who was dating him at the time of the attack, has defended him and the pair are now engaged . Since his release  Evans has continued to deny his guilt and is appealing the judgement. Meanwhile the victim has been forced to change her name and move away from her home after Evans' supporters 'outed' her online, breaching her right to anonymity as a victim of a sex crime. Evans girlfriend Natasha Massey, who was dating him at the time of the attack, has defended his actions and the pair are now engaged. Her millionaire-businessman father is believed to be behind a PR campaign and website to have Evans cleared, and has said the former-footballer can have a job at his firm if sport will not welcome him back. DJ Nick Conrad was forced to apologise on air today after saying women should 'keep their knickers on' while discussing the Ched Evans case . The development came on the day that a BBC radio presenter who said women should 'keep their knickers on' while discussing the Evans case apologised on air. Nick Conrad, a talk show host on BBC Radio Norfolk, made the comments during a live debate about the issue. After criticism from some listeners and rape campaigners, he began this morning's show by saying sorry. He came under pressure on social networking sites for him to apologise on his programme. The 29-year-old said: 'I made it clear on several occasions that rape is an abhorrent and inexcusable crime and that women who are victims are in no way to blame. 'Some of my comments in one section of the discussion were ill-judged and were offensive to some. I apologise to anybody who was offended by what I said.' In his original comments, Conrad said: 'I think women need to be more aware of a man's sexual desire that when you're in that position that you are about to engage in sexual activity there's a huge amount of energy in the male body, there's a huge amount of will and intent, and it's very difficult for many men to say no when they are whipped up into a bit of a storm. 'And it's the old adage about if you yank a dog's tail, then don't be surprised when it bites you. 'Or you can't keep snakes in the garden and think they'll only bite your neighbours.' Rape Crisis England and Wales said Conrad's remarks were the latest example of a public figure making 'ignorant comments'. Some Twitter users compared him to a real-life Alan Partridge - a reference to the Norfolk-based comedy radio presenter's politically-incorrect comments. Conrad went on to suggest that feminists had 'hijacked' or 'jumped on' the debate and appear to be 'anti-men'. May 30, 2011: CCTV shows footballer Clayton McDonald meeting victim outside a kebab shop in Rhyl at around 4am, before taking a cab with her to a nearby Premier Inn. On the way he texts friend Ched Evans to say he's 'got a bird'. Mr McDonald and Evans both had intercourse with the girl, and at one point two other men tried to film it though a window. After waking up in the hotel room with no memory of the incident, the victim went to police, and later the same day Evans and Mr McDonald are both arrested. July 26, 2011:  Evans and Mr McDonald are charged with rape, which they both deny. April 11, 2012: Evans and Mr McDonald take the stand for the first time at Caernarfon Crown Court. April 20: Mr McDonald is acquitted of rape, while Evans is found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison. During the trial Evans told the court that he had gone to the hotel after getting a text from Mr McDonald, and let himself into the room where he found the pair having sex. He claimed to have watched them before having sex with the victim himself, while two other men watched through the window and attempted to film it. April 23: The victim is named for the first time online by supporters of Evans, who begin bombarding her with abuse that police will later compare to 'virtual GBH'. Officers subsequently take the unusual step of giving the woman a false identity and moving her to away from her home - protection usually reserved for high-profile murderers released from jail. August: Evans has request to appeal his conviction turned down, though this is later overturned by the Court of Appeal in London. November, 2013: Evans continues to deny guilt and recruits new legal team to help clear his name. October 17, 2014: He is released from jail after serving half of his sentence and returns home to Rhyl where a bouncy castle is pictured being delivered to his parents' house, but is later taken away. October 18: Reports surface that Evans has been offered a £500,000 contract to re-sign for Sheffield United, though the club later deny the rumours. November 11: After a request from the Professional Footballers' Association, Sheffield United agree to allow Evans to return to the club to train, but refuse to say whether he will be signed. The same day patron Charlie Webster, who was abused as a child, walks away from the club. November 12: Lindsay Graham, another club patron, cuts her ties with the club along with another unnamed patron as 150,000 sign petition saying Evans should not be allowed to play again. November 13: Jessica Ennis-Hill asks for her name to be removed from one of the club's stands, leading to abuse on Twitter. November 17: Karl Massey, the millionaire father of Evans' girlfriend Natasha Massey, says he will offer the former-footballer a job at one of his firms if the club will not have him back . November 20: Sheffield United confirm that they have withdrawn the offer to allow Evans to train at their ground. November 22:  The Ministry of Justice said while it cannot comment on individual prisoners, in general terms the terms of a sex offender's licence would render it near impossible to work abroad, scuppering any hopes that Evans may be signed overseas for the remainder of his sentence.","Ched Evans will not be allowed to train with former club Sheffield United .

"Tottenham pursuit of Argentine centre-back Federico Fazio looks to have been successful after Sevilla coach Unai Emery admitted he was resigned to losing his captain on Friday. The 27-year-old has a 10m euro buy-out clause in his contract and so Europa League holders Sevilla are powerless to stop his departure. Emery said before the season kicks-off against Valencia on Saturday: “There is no chance that he will be playing for us this weekend.' VIDEO Scroll down for A strong Tottenham squad prepare for Europa League qualifier . Show me the money: Tottenham have been told they must pay £8million to sign Federico Fazio from Sevilla . Pricey: The defender is under contract at Sevilla and they insist on Spurs paying his £8m release clause . 'He is one of the pillars of the team but we will just have to find another player to take his place. I’m happy for him. We want him to stay but this is what happens when you win things.” Spurs coach Mauricio Pochettino knows Fazio from his time coach La Liga side Espanyol. The former Under-20 Argentine international can play in holding midfield but it’s in the centre of defence that he makes best use of his impressive 6ft 4ins frame and where he helped Sevilla to European glory last season. Sevilla signed Fazio as a 19-year-old in 2007 from Ferro Carril Oeste and his imposing physique but elegance on the ball drew comparisons with Gerard Pique at Barcelona. Injuries have not been kind to him since then and his career stagnated before Emery arrived at Sevilla. Experienced: Fazio stands at 6ft 5ins tall and he has made 179 appearances for Spanish side Sevilla . International: The 27-year-old Fazio has played for Argentina, representing his nation on two occasions . This summer there were even questions asked of Barcelona by their supporters as to why they never looked at a player who would have cost them half as much as Thomas Vermaelen. He felt his form last season should have earned him a call-up to the national team and a place in the Brazil World Cup.

"He should have been enjoying the sweet smell of success. But instead Ed Miliband's local elections triumph turned sour today as he was pelted - with an egg. The Labour leader was on a victory walkabout in Southampton after racking up 776 new council seats - almost 100 more than expected - across the country. But the vote predictions weren't the only thing that was smashed when the large chicken egg cracked on the leader's shoulder. Scroll down to see the video . Watch out, Ed! A protester cracks an  egg the Labour leader's shoulder during a victory walkabout in Southampton this afternoon . It left a runny yellow mess down Mr Miliband's grey suit as his team scrambled to catch the culprit. The politician was giving a TV interview when the man in a hat pushed through the throng and slapped the egg on Mr Miliband's shoulder. The egg broke left a yellow mess dripping down Mr Miliband's jacket, which he quickly removed and gave to an aide as the man fled down the street. Mr Miliband finished the interview in just a shirt and tie, made an exit and went back to his car. The scene was similar to when Labour's former deputy PM John  Prescott was hit with an egg thrown by a protester in 2011 in Rhyl, north Wales. Success: Ed's all smiles as his victory meet and greet appears to be going to plan, with supporters out in force waving red balloons . Crack! The protester slams the egg onto the shoulder of the Labour leader, who had been celebrating local election victory . Lord Prescott responded with two quick punches to the man's face - and earned himself the nickname 'two jabs'. Mr Miliband's response was not quite as aggressive. After being hit and removing his dirtied jacket, Mr Miliband joked that the man was 'obviously not one of my fans'. The butt of all the yolks: Mr Miliband must have felt that finally things were going well for him after a troubled start to his leadership, but his success is overshadowed by the egg attack . Ouch: Mr Miliband looks at his shoulder in disgust as his aides scramble to catch the culprit who ran away down the street . He later Tweeted: 'For those . wondering about egg's origins, fairly sure it wasn't free range but . nothing can take away from cracking result in Southampton...' The fracas was just one of several ugly scenes and marred a jubilant day for Labour in which they took control of 32 councils. The first spats of violence began yesterday in Tower Hamlets when police at a polling station had to call reinforcements after a candidate alleged that he had been threatened by activists from rival parties. Chris Smith, standing for the Greens in the London Assembly elections, claimed that one activist threatened to 'punch his lights out' when he complained about the crowd handing out Respect and Labour leaflets outside St Matthias Primary, off Brick Lane. Officers spent the rest of the day guarding polling stations across the borrough after the Met launched a formal investigation into allegations of electoral fraud in the borough. Police were called in after reports of voter intimidation outside polling stations at previous elections. It was feared that activists were 'harassing' potential voters. Two jabs: Former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott throws a left hook at the protested in blue and white striped shirt who threw an egg at him in Rhyl, Wales in 2001 . Mess: Egg runs down Lord Prescott's shoulder and in his hair, in one of the first and most memorable political egg throwing incidents in British politics . The drama was followed by a fracas in Bradford between Respect Party followers and supporters of Labour, still angry about the humiliating by-election defeat inflicted on them by MP George Galloway. In yet more ugly election scenes, police were forced to break up a late-night election count dsipute in St Helens. A row broke out as Liberal Democrats in the Labour-controlled constituency suffered a series of setbacks, leading to disappointment for the party's leader on the council, Brian Spencer who lost his seat. According to witnesses at St Helen's Town Hall there was a confrontation between Mr Spencer and Labour candidate Mark Johnson, who fell across a table and landed on his mother. Tory chairman Baroness Sayeeda Warsi was branded a 'b****' by UKIP after linking their rise to a decline in BNP support . Labour councillor Andy Bowden said: 'As the results were coming in it was becoming clear the Lib Dems had lost quite a few seats.' He added: 'There were quite a lot of police in the room and at least two interjected and separated everyone.' Mr Bowden said Mr Johnson may have twisted his ankle and was giving a statement to police. It is understood police officers intervened, but no arrests were made. Lib Dem councillor Michael Haw said Mr Spencer, the council's ex-opposition leader, was upset at losing his seat. Another  row broke out late last night after Conservative Party co-chairwoman Baroness Sayeeda Warsi linked the rise of the UK Independence Party (Ukip) with the decline of the far-right British National Party. UKIP were tipped to do well as the results poured in this morning, with the BNP falling further behind. But Lady Warsi appeared to suggest the number of candidates fielded by the eurosceptics had risen in line with a fall in the number standing for the BNP - a link with provoked Ukip's spokesman to brand her 'a bitch'. Speaking on the BBC's election night coverage, Lady Warsi said: 'Where Ukip is fielding candidates this time that the BNP did last time but they're not this time, I think that will have an impact.' She added: 'There are members of Ukip who are from all sorts of political parties, but it is an interesting mix there in terms of the number of candidates.' UKIP spokesman Gawain Towler vented his anger at Lady Warsi's comments on Twitter, calling her a 'bitch' to his 1,700 followers, some of whom criticised his 'unparliamentary language'. The spokesman quickly deleted the post and and apologised, tweeting: 'Deleted, out of order on my part'. He later added: 'Shouln't (sic) have said that, apologise.'","Culprit scrambles away down street as stunned Ed carries on with speech .

"A man was sentenced to life in prison on Friday after being convicted of killing his mother and storing her dismembered remains in boxes in the back of her car. Ari Liggett, 26, was convicted last week of first-degree murder in the 2012 death of Beverly Liggett, 56. He had pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity but a court-ordered evaluation found him to be sane. Ari Liggett was convicted last week of first-degree murder in the 2012 death of Beverly Liggett, 56, after he poisoned her at their Denver home and dismembered her in the bath . Liggett poisoned his mother with a cyanide mixture and spent the next 24 hours getting rid of the evidence by dismembering her body in the bathtub before placing her remains in plastic tubs full of olive oil. Both were reported missing in mid-October 2012. Two days later, police in the Denver suburb of Greenwood Village spotted Liggett driving his mother's SUV and stopped him. Her remains were found in two plastic storage bins in the back of the vehicle. Liggett believed that he had been cut out of his mother's will. When he was questioned by police in 2012, the former University of Colorado student mentioned his mother’s will and said his ‘definition of right and wrong may be different from what others think', according to an affidavit. During the trial, prosecutors argued Liggett had an obsessive, years-long plan to kill his mother. They acknowledged Liggett's long history of mental health issues,  but they said that did not mean he was insane. Liggett poisoned his mother with a cyanide mixture and spent the next 24 hours getting rid of the evidence by dismembering her body in the bathtub of their suburban Denver home (pictured) They said he maintained a 'method to his madness' as he spent years buying chemicals and practicing his mixtures in the Centennial home he shared with his mother. Liggett repeatedly told officers they could not prove he was sane. He said he believed people were demons and that he didn't know the difference between right and wrong. Public defender Natalie Girard repeatedly described Liggett's actions as 'completely psychotic' and argued Liggett's mental illness was too severe for him to plan his mother's murder. The killer believed that his mother was about to cut him out of her will when he murdered her in 2012 .","Ari Liggett, 26, was convicted last week of first-degree murder in the 2012 death of Beverly Liggett, 56 .

"The Quebec coroner's office is conducting an autopsy on Naima Rharouity, a 47-year-old mother of two who was killed after a piece of clothing she was wearing became caught in an escalator at a Montreal train station. Tragic accident: Naima Rharouity died Thursday when her clothing strangled her after becoming stuck in an escalator . Rharouity was at Fabre metro Thursday morning when the accident happened. It appears that she was traveling down an escalator when she fell. An item of clothing became stuck in the mechanism and tightened around her neck, strangling her. Rharouity was the mother of two young boys aged eight and five. Her family called the death a 'horrific accident.' According to CTV, her husband had just left for Morocco to make arrangements after his mother died. The coroner's office is seeking to determine what led to Rharouity's death. She was wearing a hijab at the time of her death, but it is unclear which item of her clothing became stuck. 'The . investigators looked at the different views of the cameras of the STM . and they weren't able to determine exactly the sequence of events that . led to the death of the woman,' Constable Daniel Lacoursiere told CTV. Witnesses . told police they saw the unnamed victim struggling to free her scarf . after it got lodged in the teeth of an escalator on her way down to the . subway platform. ‘While she . was trying to pull up her scarf from the escalator, her hair got caught . too and from there, everything got tied up at the end of the . escalators,’ said Constable Jean-Pierre Brabant, of the Montreal police. Commuter Bassam Joubarani told CBC.ca he . saw two Good Samaritans rushing to the aid of the 48-year-old woman, . who was lying unconscious on her back at the bottom of the moving . stairs. Joubarani recalled seeing the trapped victim still breathing, with half of her body resting on the escalator. Tragedy: Workers remove the body of a 48-year-old woman after her scarf and hair got caught in an escalator at a Montreal subway station . By the time firefighters and EMS workers arrived on the scene, Rharouity went into cardiac arrest and was pronounced dead at the scene. Société de transport de Montréal (STM), the city's transportation authority, stated that all escalators in Montreal’s subway stations are up to code. Agency spokeswoman Isabelle Tremblay told Radio Canada that Thursday's freak accident is the first of its kind. An engineer employed by STM told The Gazette escalators are equipped with safety mechanisms that are supposed to bring the moving stairs to a halt in case someone falls or an object becomes lodged in the teeth. Each escalator in Montreal’s subway stations features a pair of 'stop' buttons at the top and bottom of the stairway. Rush hour death: The woman was strangled to death as she was descending an escalator to the subway platform at the Febre station on the blue line . It remains unknown at this time if someone tried to disable the escalator as the woman was trying to free herself. Investigators are planning to review surveillance video from the Fabre station to determine the circumstances surrounding the accident. They are urging people who witnessed the incident to come forward. This is not the first time that an escalator caused bodily harm and even death. In 1989, a 2-year-old girl lost four fingers when her hand got caught in the teeth of an escalator as she was trying to pick up a bag of raisins at another Montreal subway stop. In 2004, 16 students riding an escalator in a Montreal high school were injured when the moving stairs abruptly stopped. Last year, a man in Seattle was strangled to death when his shirt got caught in an escalator at a transit station. Global News reported that in August 2013, a 10-year-old girl’s foot was maimed after being caught in an escalator at a Macy’s department store in in Paramus, New Jersey.","Naima Rharouity, 47, died after an item of clothing she was wearing became caught in an escalator .

"A pub was at the centre of a race row after its white landlord 'blacked up' and a black barman dressed as a member of the Ku Klux Klan. The Queens Head came under fire after landlord Simon Tickner covered himself in brown makeup as part of a 'witch doctor' costume, while a black employee dressed as a racist Klansman - complete with a cross. Mr Tickner has been forced to apologised for the stunt and claims he had not intended to cause any offence. Race storm: The Queens Head in Brixton came under fire after pictures emerged which  show white landlord Simon Tickner 'blacked up' and a white barman dressed as a member of the Ku Klux Klan . To complete his Halloween outfit, Tickner wore a tinfoil hat and 'tribal' necklaces, for the fancy dress party thrown last weekend. The other man, who is as yet unnamed, was even seen to be throwing an apparent Hitler salute, in pictures which were posted on the Brixton pub's Facebook page. PR worker Nisha Damji complained when she saw the shocking images, and was sent back an offensive Facebook message from somebody using the pub's account. The message read: “Yo b***h. Ask my black clientele what they think and suck my d***.” Londoner Nisha said: 'To be called a b***h and to be threatened with sexual violence was utterly appalling. Defence: The Queen's Head's landlord defended the costumes, saying they were an 'absurdist joke' 'As well as the deeply offensive costumes and blackface, one of them gave the Nazi salute. It's not cool or edgy - It's is totally unacceptable in 2014.' Nisha added: 'Just because the Klansman was black, doesn't make it okay, and it definitely doesn't justify the Nazi salute. 'Brixton has a history of racial tension, and this is the sort of offensive situation can spiral out of control.' Jabeer Butt, deputy chief executive of the Race Equality Foundation, said: 'It's shocking. 'The people saying 'a black person dressing up makes it okay' are wrong too.' Tickner, 45, has since apologised for the shocking costumes and behaviour. He said: 'I think it was an absurdist joke, basically. 'My black barman dressed as a Klansman. It's an absurdist joke. Anybody who was offended I would like to apologise to. 'I literally have no cause to offend the black community. I've possibly got the most multi-racial pub in Brixton.' He denied posting the sexually offensive Facebook comment.

"A respected University of Pittsburgh researcher has been found guilty of first-degree murder by handing his wife a drink to boost her fertility - after lacing it with cyanide. Dr Robert Ferrante told his lab assistant to purchase 'the purest' cyanide on his corporate credit card overnight on April 15, 2013. Two days later, he prepared a drink of fertility booster Creatine for his wife, 41-year-old neurologist Dr Autumn Klein, who was desperate for a second child. By April 20, she was dead. On Friday, despite a lengthy legal battle in which he tried to claim Klein died of natural causes, Ferrante hung his head as prosecutors branded him a 'master manipulator' and the jury delivered a guilty verdict. It came after his near-perfect murder unraveled as police obtained evidence he searched cyanide poisoning on Google. His story also changed - from claiming he was upstairs when Klein drank the poison, to insisting he was downstairs. Guilty: Dr Robert Ferrante has been found guilty of first-degree murder by poisoning his wife Autumn Klein . Prosecutors said Ferrante concocted the plan to kill his wife after she pressured him to have a second child and because he may have feared she was having an affair or planned to divorce him. The jury deliberated for 15 hours over two days before agreeing with Allegheny County prosecutors that Klein had been murdered. It means he now faces a mandatory life sentence. Klein's relatives burst into tears upon hearing the guilty verdict. 'Justice for Autumn,' said her mother, Lois Klein, of Towson, Maryland, outside the courtroom later. The 66-year-old Ferrante denied poisoning his wife, insisting she died of natural causes. However, he changed his story a number of times and was found to have searched ways to cure cyanide poisoning online. His lawyers made the case that she might not have been poisoned at all, citing three defense experts who said that couldn't be conclusively proved. 'At a minimum we established very clear reasonable doubt,' defense attorney William Difenderfer said, referring primarily to testimony from celebrity pathologist Dr Cyril Wecht, who said he couldn't determine how Klein died because he thought a test that showed cyanide in her blood was unreliable. 'Master manipulator': Prosecutors said Ferrante has spent a year constructing his cover-up story . Motives? The jury heard Klein (right) wanted a second child and Ferrante (left) feared she might leave him . Ferrante said the cyanide he bought was for stem cell experiments he was conducting on Lou Gehrig's disease, because the toxin can be used to kill of neurological cells and thus simulate the disease in the lab. The key to the prosecution's case was a test on Klein's blood that revealed a lethal level of cyanide. The blood was drawn while doctors at UPMC Presbyterian hospital tried in vain for three days to save her life, though the results weren't known until after she died and her body was cremated. 'Justice for Autumn!': Klein's relatives wept and embraced as the guilty verdict was delivered . Jurors said they found the lab test showing the lethal level of cyanide in Klein's blood to be the most reliable test in evidence. They also said Ferrante's decision to testify may have been a mistake. Police said Ferrante told them he was downstairs in the kitchen and gave his wife a creatine drink before she collapsed, but on the witness stand Ferrante said he was upstairs when she got home, he didn't know if she drank anything and she collapsed after giving him a kiss on the cheek. The jurors said that Ferrante changing his story about where he was and what happened in his wife's final moments led them to believe he was lying. 'I think he had incredible coaches,' juror Helen Ewing said. 'I think he had a year to think about what story he wanted to tell.' Jurors also were moved by a recording of a 911 call Ferrante made while his wife was groaning, moaning and gasping for air in the background. Ewing said she was 'horrified' by Klein's suffering, while fellow juror Lance Deweese said, 'It got you in the gut. It got you in the heart.' Ferrante did online searches on cyanide poisoning and how it might be removed by the medical treatments Klein received or detected by a coroner after her death. He said that the queries were related to his research and that the other searches were made simply as he tried to understand the treatment his wife received. The life sentence is mandatory in any first-degree murder case. Prosecutors declined to pursue the death penalty because they said they found no aggravating circumstances that would have made it a capital offense.","Dr Robert Ferrante, 66, found guilty of murdering wife Dr Autumn Klein .

"Prince Charles is to spearhead the Government’s war on drugs when he visits Colombia later this month. The Foreign Office has asked the Prince and the Duchess of Cornwall to visit the South American country, one of the world’s largest producers of cocaine, to strengthen ‘co-operation in the fight against drugs and crime’ as well as expand trade links. During his four-day stay Charles will discuss co-operation between drug agencies in Columbia and the UK with President Juan Manuel Santos Calderon. Off to Mexico: Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall will visit Mexico and Colombia later this month . The Prince and the Duchess will then fly on to Mexico, where they will visit four cities and stop off at the Museo del Paste – or Pasty Museum – in Real del Monte, which celebrates the Cornish delicacy bought to the country in the 1820s by Cornish tin miners. Much of Mexico - and all of Colombia - will be new to Camilla who, despite having privately travelled to the area in the past, has never made an official trip. The couple's visit comes at the request of the British Government, following invitations from President Calderon  and President Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico. 'The visit will be a major boost to the bilateral relationship between the UK and these two dynamic and influential nations in Latin America,' a spokeswoman said. During the tour, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall will take part in a series of engagements, many of which touch on matters close to Charles' heart, among them youth unemployment and the environment. Success: The visit comes in the wake of Prince Harry's Brazil tour which saw him get a hug from a policeman . Prince Popular: Harry proved a big hit with the locals as he toured Brazil and Chile on behalf of the UK . Well travelled: With the exception of Kate, all senior royals will have visited Latin America following the tour . Trade and investment will also be high on the agenda, as will combating domestic and sexual violence, with Camilla taking a leading role in the latter. The couple will travel to Colombia first, arriving in Bogotá on the 28th October, and will get an official welcome from President Santos and his wife María Clemencia Rodríguez  at Casa de Narino, the following day. Other engagements in Bogotá will focus on traditional arts and crafts, historical architecture, organic food and wool, trade and investment and a celebration of the British Council’s 75th anniversary. They will also attend a peace and reconciliation ceremony to remember the victims of Colombia’s armed conflict, which still continues sporadically and has resulted in between 50,000 and 200,000 deaths. Happy memories: Prince Charles sports a Mexican straw hat during his first visit to the country in 1966 . Flying visit: Prince Charles' only visit to Colombia took place during his stint on HMS Minerva . The Duchess will also attend a high-level meeting for charities and government representatives attempting to combat sexual violence - another appalling feature of the conflict. Charles, meanwhile, will tour Macarena National Park in southern Colombia, before travelling to Cartagena with Camilla, where he is to deliver the concluding speech at the Health Of The Oceans international conference. Charles and Camilla will end their visit to Colombia with a sunset ceremony on board HMS Argyll, which will be moored in Cartagena. The Prince, having been a naval officer on his last visit to Colombia in 1974, will take part in this ceremony in his role as the Admiral of the Fleet. Happy return: The Prince of Wales returned to Mexico in 1970 before making a third trip to the country in 1993 . Convivial: For his four-day tour in 1993, he was welcomed officially by then-president, Carlos Salinas . Excitement: Like  Harry in Brazil, Charles was greeted by excited crowds all over Mexico during his third visit . After waving goodbye to Colombia, the couple will travel on to Mexico, beginning with a visit to the town of Real del Monte, which has had close ties with Cornwall for more than 150 years. Cornish miners arrived there from Falmouth in 1825 to help reinvigorate the Mexican silver mining industry. But they didn't only bring mining techniques. As well as industrial skills, the miners brought the Cornish pasty and football with them - both of which remain enormously popular today. Indeed, so close is the relationship between Real del Monte and Cornwall, it is twinned with the town of Redruth and boasts scores of civic ties. Good time: On his most recent visit in 2002, Charles indulged in a game of pool with some of the local children . Wonderful experience: During his last tour, Charles also played football and visited a butterfly sanctuary . The couple's first day in Mexico is also the Day of the Dead, a public holiday when people gather to pray for and remember friends and family members who have died, and visit their graves. Charles and Camilla will join the locals and mark the day by visiting the Cornish cemetery in Real del Monte, which contains the only known British First World War memorial in Mexico. The memorial, which pays tribute to a Cornish immigrant who died at the Battle of the Somme, will also be the scene of a wreath-laying ceremony in which both Charles and Camilla will pay their respects. Later, the couple will travel on to Mexico City, where they will receive an official welcome from President Enrique Peña Nieto and his wife Angélica Rivera at the presidential palace. On tour together: Since becoming Duchess of Cornwall, Camilla has accompanied Charles on scores of visits . Busy: Along with UK visits such as this one to Whitby, the couple have visited Australia, Canada and Jordan . Romantic: They also visited the Ashkardham Temple in Delhi during last year's tour of India . Other events will include a reception at the historical Antiguo Colegio de San Ildefonso to announce the Year of the UK in Mexico and the Year of Mexico in the UK in 2015 - a programme designed to promote collaboration in the fields of education, science and innovation, culture, and business. Later, in Campeche, the Prince and Duchess will visit the Edzna Maya archaeological site, which dates back to 400BC. During their tour of the site, they will learn about the renaissance of the site and meet some of the workers who have helped to restore the ruins. On their final stop in Monterrey, the business and industrial centre of northern Mexico, the couple will receive an official welcome by the Governor before undertaking a programme of events that will highlight the regeneration of the area’s historical sites.","The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall will visit Colombia .

"All her life, the elderly worshipper had been inspired by her church’s fresco of Jesus with his crown  of thorns. So when the plaster portrait began to crumble owing to damp, the woman in her 80s decided not to stand idly by. Without consulting the authorities at the Sanctuary of Mercy Church in Borjanos, southern Spain, she marched in with oil paint and brush, and started work on her own private restoration project. 'Restored': The image bears more resemblance to a character from Planet of the Apes than to Jesus after a woman in her 80's 'repaired' it without permission . Original: Elias Garcia Martinez's 'Ecce Homo', which has been admired by worshippers at the Sanctuary of Mercy Church in Zaragoza, Spain, for more than 120 years . Damaged: Moisture in the church caused the surface of the fresco, which has huge sentimental value, to deteriorate . Quite what she thinks of her  handiwork has not been disclosed. But her fellow worshippers are horrified. The 120-year-old fresco, Ecce Homo by . Elijah Garcia Martinez, has been transformed into something which looks . more like a movie werewolf. To add to the general embarrassment, a . local Catholic cultural foundation, the Centre for Borjanos, had . received a donation from the granddaughter of the artist which it was . about to spend on returning the fresco to its former glory.

"The TV watchdog has launched an investigation into ITV2 show On The Pull which failed to be recommissioned last week following a public outcry over central character Dapper Laughs. More than 68,000 people and 44 comedians signed a petition calling for the programme, featuring comedian Daniel O'Reilly, to be banned as it was giving a platform to 'everyday sexism'. Mr O'Reilly, 25, also saw his UK stand-up tour cancelled after telling an audience member she was 'gagging for a rape'. Appearing on BBC's Newsnight last week, the comedian said that he was retiring his Dapper Laughs persona and moaned that the complaints against him had 'wrecked his life'. Ofcom has launched an investigation into ITV2 show On The Pull which failed to be recommissioned last week following a public outcry over central character Dapper Laughs . He found internet fame on Vine and Twitter - leading to his TV show - as south London 'lad' Dapper Laughs, who engaged women in 'banter' in the name of comedy. The show, which aimed to teach men to be better at 'pulling', included stunts such as asking for women's numbers in the street and featured a catalogue of degrading catchphrases. Broadcast regulator Ofcom announced today that it is looking into whether the show fell foul of broadcasting rules and was offensive to viewers. A spokesman for the regulator said: 'Ofcom is currently investigating whether the repeated use of sexual references in this comedy series met generally accepted standards.' Laddish: Daniel O'Reilly was grilled on the BBC's Newsnight after 68,000 people and 44 comedians called for his ITV2 show Dapper Laughs: On The Pull to be axed for giving a platform to 'everyday sexism' While on Newsnight last week, Mr O'Reilly, from Clapham, south London, insisted repeatedly that Dapper Laughs was a 'character' and didn't reflect his real personality. He said: 'It's completely ruined everything that's going on with me as a comedian. 'The bad press and everything that's happened - it's wrecked my life to a certain extent.' At the time I didn't think that so many people would end up seeing it. In the end it became very popular and I kind of got a bit carried away with it, to be honest with you. 'It's wrong but, to me, I didn't see it as me who was saying it, I was creating this character and I was really pushing the boundaries with this character because it was popular. 'I thought that the people that were viewing it were saying this is ridiculous and laughing at it.' The ITV2 show Dapper Laughs: On The Pull - which claimed to teach awkward men how to talk to women - finished its first series on November 3. Mr O'Reilly, from Clapham, south London, insisted repeatedly that Dapper Laughs was a 'character' and didn't reflect his real personality . He said he took the decision to cancel the tour after deciding he did not want to perform as the character any more. 'I am not going to allow Dapper Laughs to represent me,' he said. 'I want the people out there to know that not only am I going to stop it, I am going to help it not being promoted.' His bids to defend himself previously led to even more anger. Defending claims the show encouraged rape, he told a live audience: 'If it was a guide to rape, I would have done one five-minute episode, come on and go ""Oi oi, I'm Dapper Laughs, go down the shops, get some rope, bit of duct tape, rape the b****, well done, see you later"".' He was later heard telling a female audience member she was 'gagging for a rape' before adding 'do you want to come backstage after, yeah? Bring two of your mates, you’ll need them'. An ITV spokesman said: 'We have given careful thought to the recent criticism of the character Dapper Laughs, which has focused on his activities outside of the ITV2 programme, whose content was carefully considered and complied. 'We have taken the decision that we will not be considering this show for a second series.' The ITV2 show Dapper Laughs: On The Pull - which claimed to teach awkward men how to talk to women - finished its first series on November 3 . Face-off: Daniel O'Reilly was grilled by the BBC's Emily Maitlis as he revealed he is retiring his 'character' EMILY MAITLIS: Dan O'Reilly, at best what you do is offensive, at worst it incites harassment and violence. DANIEL O'REILLY: Mm. No, d'you know what, from the beginning when I started the character Dapper Laughs it caught on really quick that that type of humour was really popular for a certain demographic of people... In the end it became really popular and I kind of got a little bit carried away with it to be honest with you. EM: When you see that now, what do you think? DOR: If that was the first time I'd seen that kind of comedy I'd think the character is not setting a good example, but at the time when we were doing it, it was getting so much praise from the audience it was being received by and growing and growing and growing... I thought maybe y'know these people could see that I'm, cos, saying that, obviously to me, it's like c'mon, that's not, that's not real, obviously I don't think that, but I, I'm taking the mick out of what I thought men think, d'you what I mean? EM: Right. So when you say you're giving advice to men on the pull and for example you say 'get your g*** out' to women, can you deny that would encourage men to do that on the street? DOR: Yeah potentially of course, you're right, it's, it's, y'know, it's wrong, but, to, well I'm not going to say but, but to me, I didn't see it as me that was saying that, I was creating this character and I was really pushing the boundaries with this character because it was quite popular. EM: So you agree that when you create this character and it incites sexual violence... DOR: I didn't think it did at the time, I thought the people that were viewing it were saying this is ridiculous and laughing at it. EM: You've said Dapper Laughs is an extension of yourself. He allows you to do things you wouldn't normally do and you blame it on him. Doesn't sound like satire at all, it sounds like an excuse. DOR: Well that's not the attitude that I did have with it. D'you know what, to be completely honest with you, it was great at the beginning for me, it's completely ruined everything that's going on with me as a comedian. EM: Just another line that came up, 'Just show her your penis, if she cries she's playing hard to get'. There's a bit in the film we saw where you're holding up a knife and you say 'Lift up your f****** shirt. Was that all just done in jest? DOR: No disrespect to you, looking at me now, do you think I'd go out and do that? I was creating, I was pushing the boundaries of that character. EM: But what you're saying is that women who say no don't mean no, and if people watching that think it's funny and they go and enact that, then that's the consequence... DOR: That makes me sad to think if someone had done that and I was responsible for that it's terrible. That's why this week with the bad press and everything that's happened, I've stopped and said, y'know, it's wrecked my life to a certain extent. EM: So you're feeling like a bit of a victim now, are you? DOR: I wouldn't say that, maybe a victim of my own mistakes.","Daniel O'Reilly is the man behind comedy persona Dapper Laughs .

She reportedly claimed: 'When we rebut his points, he resorts to saying, well, it was 40 years ago ... the girls were teenagers, not too young ... they weren't the worst kind of sexual offences etc.' Ms MacKean, who appeared on the BBC's Panorama documentary last night, said she believed Mr Rippon did not tell BBC1, which was planning to run Savile tributes, about the investigation.

"Facebook users who delete inappropriate or embarrassing images from their accounts - with the the benefit of hindsight - can now have peace of mind that the files will be permanently destroyed. Until recently, any pictures erased from an account would in fact . remain stored by Facebook and anyone who had the direct link . to that picture could therefore still view it. The news may come as some relief to young people in the throws of trying get a job or impress a new employer, knowing that many companies today show an interest in the social network accounts of their staff. Until recently any pictures deleted by an account holder would remain stored on Facebook's server and accessible with the correct link . Pictures now erased by an account user will be permanently wiped from the system within 14 days, but with a potential maximum delay of 30 days. They will be immediately removed from view on a user's account from the moment they delete the picture. 'It has taken them a very long time to do it because this change probably represents a huge engineering effort,' said Cambridge PhD student, Joseph Bonneau, quoted in The Sunday Times. It was three years ago that the 28-year-old discovered that pictures he had deleted from the site were still available for all to see if they had saved a link to them. 'The lesson hopefully to other companies is to build in privacy right form the start, because if you don't get it right first time, it can be a huge effort to fix,' he said. At a time when unemployment is high and job security is therefore a high priority for many, potential candidates may be considering how they come across from the information on their social network accounts. Research suggests that up to 91% of employers now use social sites such as MySpace, Twitter, Facebook, Flickr and LinkedIn to screen job applicants. Facebook, founded by Mark Zuckerberg, pictured, came under fire three years ago when users realised their deleted photos were still held by the company . As many as 69% say they have rejected candidates based on information on their accounts. There are also numerous cases of employees who have lost their jobs as a result of images or information posted on such social networking media, intentionally or not. Most notably, US Republican Anthony Weiner resigned after publicly posting a lewd picture of himself to a woman on Twitter, instead of privately sending the photo to her account. Also in the US, schoolteacher Ashley Payne, 24, was given the option of resigning or a suspension after a parent complained about a Facebook photo of her with a glass of wine and a pint of beer. She resigned. Some experts say that young people should be advised on the risks of sharing everything about their lives on publicly available social networks. Since Facebook floated on the stock exchange in May this year, some argue that improving glitches in the system, such as picture removal and deletion, will become more pressing concerns for the company as it seeks to be a more attractive media stock than its rivals.","Issue of accessible 'deleted' photos was first raised three years ago .

"Pope Benedict XVI may be looking forward to a well-earned retirement this week, but there is at least one thing he will surely miss about his current office - his flashy red shoes. New details of how he will be treated after his retirement on Thursday emerged today, as it was revealed he will take the title of 'emeritus pope' and will continue to be called 'His Holiness'. Although Benedict will no longer be allowed to wear the red leather shoes that are one of the most recognisable papal symbols, he will continue to wear the white robes which are associated with the Pope. Snappy dresser: Pope Benedict XVI wearing his traditional red shoes while meeting then Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams during his visit to Britain in 2010 . Losing out: His Holiness will no longer don his trademark footwear after he retires on Thursday . The pope's title and what he would wear have been a major source of speculation ever since Benedict stunned the world and announced he would resign on Thursday, the first pontiff to do so in 600 years. Reverend Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said Benedict himself had made the decision in consultation with others, settling on 'Your Holiness Benedict XVI' and either 'emeritus pope' or 'emeritus Roman pontiff'. In the two weeks since Benedict's resignation announcement, Vatican officials had suggested that Benedict would resume wearing the traditional black garb of a cleric and would use the title 'emeritus bishop of Rome' so as to not create confusion with the future pope. Benedict's decision to call himself emeritus pope and to keep wearing white will fan concern voiced privately by some cardinals about the awkward reality of having two popes living within the Vatican walls. Adding to the concern is the fact that Benedict's trusted secretary, Monsignor Georg Gaenswein, will be serving both pontiffs - living with Benedict at a monastery inside the Vatican and working in the new Pope's household. Stepping down: Benedict leading Sunday prayers for the last time before leaving his office . Benedict has made it clear he is retiring to a lifetime of prayer and meditation 'hidden from the world'. Pope Emeritus is a title that has been coined to cover the near-unprecedented presence of a retired Pope. The word 'emeritus' enables someone of status such as a professor who has handed over their position to retain their former rank in their title. The Pope has two days left before he takes the historic step of becoming the first pontiff in six centuries to step down instead of ruling for life. He will be known as 'pope emeritus Benedict XVI' or 'Roman Pontiff emeritus Benedict XVI', be addressed as 'Your Holiness', and be referred to as 'His Holiness Benedict XVI'. This means that after the election of the new pope next month there will be two men with the title 'holiness' in the Vatican at the same time. However, he still will be very present . in the tiny Vatican city-state, where his new home is right next door to . the Vatican Radio and has a view of the dome of St Peter's Basilica. In the absence of his red shoes, Benedict has taken a liking to a pair of hand-crafted brown loafers made for him by artisans in Leon, Mexico, and given to him during his 2012 visit. Mr Lombardi also elaborated on the College of Cardinals meetings that will take place after the papacy becomes vacant - crucial gatherings in which cardinals will discuss the problems facing the church and set a date for the start of the conclave to elect Benedict's successor. The first meeting is not expected until Monday, since the official convocation to cardinals to come to Rome will only go out on Friday - the first day of what's known as the 'sede vacante,' or the vacancy between papacies. In all, 115 cardinals under the age of 80 are expected in Rome for the conclave to vote on who should become the next pope. Benedict yesterday gave the cardinals the go-ahead to move up the start date of the conclave, abolishing the traditional 15-day waiting period. Preparations: A priest in St Peter's Square this week ahead of the Pope's retirement . Mr Lombardi also further described Benedict's final 48 hours as Pope. On Tuesday, he was packing, arranging for documents to be sent to the various archives at the Vatican and separating out the personal papers he will take with him into retirement. On Wednesday, Benedict will hold his final public general audience in St Peter's Square - an event that has already seen 50,000 ticket requests. On Thursday, the Pope meets with his cardinals in the morning and then flies by helicopter at 5pm to Castel Gandolfo, the papal residence south of Rome. He will greet parishioners there from the palazzo's loggia - his final public act as pope. At 8pm, the exact time at which his retirement becomes official, the Swiss Guards standing outside the doors of the palazzo at Castel Gandolfo will go off duty, their service protecting the head of the Catholic Church now finished.","Pope will be known as 'His Holiness' and will continue to wear white robes .

The 49-year-old rap mogul is still recovering after getting shot six times two months ago, and on Wednesday he was arrested for allegedly stealing the camera in an incident that left her with 'minor injuries'. Comedian Katt Williams has also been charged with felony robbery steaming from the alleged scuffle on September 5 in Beverly Hills, California, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office. Theft chart: Suge Knight was arrested in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Wednesday (pictured) for allegedly stealing a female photographer's camera last month . The founder of Death Row Records was detained in Las Vegas, Nevada, while 41-year-old Katt was arrested as he arrived at the Inglewood Courthouse in Las Angeles to face charges relating to a separate assault case. Beverly Hills Police confirmed to the MailOnline that while the arrests have been made, the investigation remains ongoing. In a statement, the District Attorney's Office said the incident occurred outside a recording studio just days after Suge was shot in late August during Chris Brown's Pre-VMA party at a Hollywood nightclub. Also arrested: Comedian Katt Williams, pictured in a previous mug shot from an unrelated case, has also been charged with felony robbery steaming from the alleged scuffle on September 5 in Beverly Hills, California . According to the District Attorney's Office: 'The two men are suspected of stealing the camera of an independent celebrity photographer on Sept. 5 outside a studio in Beverly Hills.' If found guilty, Suge faces significantly more time than Katt due to a previous assault with a deadly weapon conviction, the DA said. 'If convicted, Knight, who has a prior conviction for assault with a deadly weapon, faces up to 30 years to life in state prison. Williams faces up to seven years in custody.' From the scene: Photos from the day of the alleged incident show a woman nursing an injured finger . Investigations continue: Beverly Hills police are continuing to look into the alleged incident, which reportedly left the woman with 'minor injuries' Both men made bail, with prosecutors asking it to be set at $1 million for the record label founder and $75,000 for the comedian. Photos of the alleged incident show a woman nursing an injured finger, however, neither Katt nor Suge were pictured at the scene. Beverly Hills police Sgt. Max Subin told the LA Times that after coming out of the studio the comedian and hip hop mogul came across the photographer and allegedly chased the woman down an alley. Facing serious time: If convicted, Suge, pictured 2013, faces up to 30 years behind bars . The officer said Kat then grabbed the woman's camera 'forcibly' and she 'sustained minor injuries'. When police arrived on the scene, both of the stars had left, he said. Neither man has been charged with assault. Both Suge - whose real name is Marion - and Katt - real name Micah - have had their fair share of run-ins with police. When he was arrested on Wednesday, Katt was to face court over a July 15 incident in Inglewood when he allegedly pepper-sprayed a man and tried to hit him with his car. The comedian was charged with two counts of felony assault in addition to the use of tear gas. That same month, Los Angeles County sheriffs were called to the Comedy Store in West Hollywood after reports he pulled out a gun and smashed a car window. No charges were laid over that incident. Suge's rap sheet is a little longer, with the 49-year-old first arrested in 1992 on assault and weapons charges for which he received probation. However in 1996, he was arrested after security cameras at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas caught him and a group of other men beating a gang member. He was sentenced to nine years in prison for parole violation. He was imprisoned twice more for violating his parole after being caught consorting with gang members and then assaulting a valet in 2003. Suge has also been the victim of a number of serious crimes - and has been shot three times. Besides getting shot in August, Suge was also injured in 2005, when he was shot in Miami during another pre-awards party. Most famously he was hit by bullet fragments in 1996 in Las Vegas when he was sitting next to rapper Tupac Shakur during a drive-by hit on their car. Tupac did not survive. Tough year: On August 24, the rap mogul was shot six times inside Chris Brown's pre-VMA party at a Hollywood nightclub. It was the third time he had been injured in a shooting .","The 49-year-old rap mogul is still recovering after getting shot six times two months ago .

"Dangerous: Something as simple as deodorant could put mothers-to-be at risk of a miscarriage . A chemical found in dozens of household items may double a woman’s risk of miscarriage, researchers warn. Scientists said pregnant women should avoid canned food, stop heating food in plastic containers and even avoid touching cash register receipts. Researchers from the prestigious Stanford University in California found pregnant women with the highest levels of the chemical bisphenol A (BPA) in their blood were 80 per cent more likely to miscarry. They measured levels of the chemical – found in plastics and items including water bottles, sunglasses and CD cases – when the pregnancy was confirmed by the doctor. Lead researcher Dr Ruth Lathie said: ‘Until further studies are performed, women with unexplained miscarriages should avoid BPA exposure in an effort to remove one potential risk factor. ‘There are some simple things that people can do, but it’s impossible to avoid it completely. ‘Avoid anything that involves cooking or warming food in plastic as the chemicals leak out of plastic materials at a higher rate at higher temperatures. ‘Avoid canned food, avoid cooking or heating plastic and also avoid touching things that have high BPA resin – something as simple as a cash register receipt which is coded with resin that has BPA in it.’ Miscarriages are common and statistically one in three women in the UK will suffer one at some point during their lives. A spokesman from the Miscarriage Association said the US study was too small to draw any firm conclusions, and warned against causing further worry for pregnant women who are already told to avoid many products, including caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, raw eggs and pate. In another study, the US Government’s National Institute of Child Health and Human Development looked at the records of 501 couples who were trying to become pregnant between 2005 and 2009. All provided urine samples which were measured for levels of BPA and phthalates – another group of chemicals used in plastics. Warning: Researchers said miscarriage risks increased by 80 per cent when women came into contact with BPA . They were monitored for a year and kept diaries stating if and when they became pregnant. Oddly, the researchers found that high levels of phthalates affected men’s fertility but not women’s. Couples where the male partner had high recordings were 20 per cent more likely not to conceive within the year. Dr Linda Giudice, president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, said: ‘These chemicals are a cause of concern to all of us. 'We don’t know necessarily the exact biochemical mechanism [cause] but other studies point to the need to be aware of the use of these chemicals.’ The findings from the two studies follow a World Health Organisation move to ban phthalates and bisphenol A amid suggestions they also cause breast cancer, leukaemia, asthma and birth defects. The WHO said the chemicals had ‘serious implications’ for health, and a ban was needed to ‘protect future generations’. Elizabeth Salter-Green, of the campaign group CHEM Trust, said: ‘Both pieces of research highlight how vitally important it is for the UK Government to agree the need for EU measures to eliminate our exposure to all hormone disruptors. 'We could be jeopardising future generations as hormones are so fundamental to our ability to reproduce.’ The studies are being presented today at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine’s conference in Boston.","World Health Organisation aims to ban toxins causing 80% miscarriage risk .

"This awe-inspiring image shows Nasa's Curiosity Mars Rover as it drives across the red planet and was taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter satellite   - 200 miles above the surface. The car-sized robotic rover and the tracks it makes as it drives on the surface of the alien planet, 34 million miles away from Earth, are clearly   visible in this view from orbit, acquired on April 11 by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on NASA's orbiter, the largest   ever carried on a deep space mission. Scientists are using NASA's Curiosity Mars rover to probe a rock layer surrounding the base of a small butte (an isolated hill with steep sides) called   'Mount Remarkable'. Orbital: This Nasa image shows the Curiosity Mars Rover as it drives across the red planet and was taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter satellite . Route: A close up of the rover's tyre tracks, clearly visible from orbit . It may be a potential target for investigating using tools on the rover's robotic arm. Curiosity's science team refers to the rock layer surrounding the base of Mount Remarkable, which is about five metres high, as the 'middle unit'   because its location is intermediate between rocks that form buttes in the area and lower-lying rocks that show a pattern of striations - a series of   ridges, furrows or linear marks. Depending on what the mission scientists learn from a close-up look at the rock and identification of chemical elements in it, a site on this middle   unit may become the third rock that Curiosity samples with its drill. The rover carries laboratory instruments to analyse rock powder collected by the drill. The mission's first two drilled samples, in an area called   Yellowknife Bay near Curiosity's landing site, yielded evidence last year for an ancient lakebed environment with available energy and ingredients   favourable for microbial life. Eye in the sky: The image was taken by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on NASA's orbiter . NASA's Curiosity Mars rover used its Navigation Camera (Navcam) to record this scene of a butte called 'Mount Remarkable' and surrounding outcrops at a waypoint called 'the Kimberley' inside Gale Crater . Curiosity has been operational on Mars since August 2012 and is entering a key science phase of the mission . The rover's current location, where multiple types of rocks are exposed close together, is called 'the Kimberley'. Here and, later, at outcrops on the   slope of Mount Sharp inside Gale Crater, researchers plan to use Curiosity's science instruments to learn more about habitable past conditions and   environmental changes. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of Caltech in Pasadena, manages the Mars Science Laboratory Project for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. The project designed and built Curiosity and operates the rover on Mars.  Last week Nasa spoke out on the controversy surrounding a strange 'glow' spotted on Mars - and says it is either a shiny rock or a glitch in the   Curiosity rover's camera. Life on Mars? In this photo taken by the Curiosity rover a light of unknown origin can be seen in the distance . UFO blogger Scott Waring claimed that the new photograph taken by the rover suggests there are intelligent creatures living underground. However, Nasa investigated the image and found it was simply a trick of the light.  'One possibility is that the light is the glint from a rock surface reflecting the sun,' a Nasa spokesperson told MailOnline. 'When these images were taken each day, the sun was in the same direction as the bright spot, west-northwest from the rover, and relatively low in the   sky. 'The rover science team is also looking at the possibility that the bright spots could be caused by cosmic rays striking the camera's detector.' Nasa's engineers believe the glow may have been caused by sunlight reaching the camera's sensors through a vent hole in the camera housing. The rover's top speed is 1.5 inches (3.8 centimetres) per second. Curiosity is the fourth rover to visit Mars. It took around seven minutes to land on the Red Planet. The rover is fitted with 17 cameras. It weighs about the same as a Mini Cooper at approximately 2,000lb (900kg). Scientists considered 60 possible landing sites before deciding on Gale Crater.","Image was snapped using high-tech camera 200 miles above the red planet .

"One of the ‘beautiful women’ that Ferris Bueller actor Ben Stein revealed he had a ‘mad crush’ on in a bizarre essay he penned last month has hit back at the former Nixon speechwriter. In a column for The American Spectator, the former New York Times writer, who has been married to attorney Alexandra Denman for 45 years, wrote about women he met on a recent speaking tour in California. Among them was an 'absolute knockout young Eurasian woman', who Stein also referred to as ‘Lucia’ and a former ‘call girl’. One of the 'beautiful women' that Ferris Bueller actor Ben Stein revealed he had a 'mad crush' on in a bizarre essay he penned last month, Tanya Ma, (pictured with the actor, right) has hit back at the former Nixon speechwriter . Tanya Ma, a 24-year-old pregnant performance artist, told the New York Post that Stein gave her money and then begged to ¿touch¿ her even though she¿s pregnant . The Yale-educated former Nixon speech writer wrote that he was immediately smitten after first setting eyes on her at the San Francisco airport in the spring. She was ‘a stunningly beautiful, absolute knockout young Eurasian woman,’ Stein wrote, and ‘we have been in touch almost every day since.’ The woman, a 24-year-old pregnant performance artist called Tanya Ma, has now told the New York Post that Stein gave her money and then begged to ‘touch’ her even though she’s pregnant. ‘It’s much more than sexting, cyber-escorting or being a sugar daddy - it’s unhealthy and toxic behavior that needs to be exposed,’ said Ma, who lives in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Tanya, who admits she briefly worked as an escort in Chicago, said that she and Stein texted for about four months before he asked me to send him pictures. ‘He said he was very captivated and he just wanted to remember me. After a while, he started asking for more racy photos,’ she told the Post. In his June column for The American Spectator, Stein wrote about a never-ending string of beautiful women he met as he traveled. 'My main obsessions in my life are my . wife, my dog, my son and his family, my secret GF from Mississippi, and . any beautiful girl I meet,' he wrote. 'I am like a teenager. I get mad . crushes.' He . wrote that woman - now revealed by the Post as Ma - asked him to help her become a writer but he said there was little . he could do. After meeting, they texted daily before she revealed that she was . pregnant by a man she'd had a brief relationship with. Tanya, who admits she briefly worked as an escort in Chicago, said that she and Stein texted for about four months before he asked me to send him pictures . Married: He has been married to attorney Alexandra Denman for 45 years and insisted that she always knows about the women he meets and speaks to. He said there was no sexting scandal . 'I'll just be a single mom,' she texted him. 'Will you help me out?' He wrote: 'I am so pro-life that I can never say no in these cases but I am worried about it.' He wrote that he considered flying her to . his hometown of Los Angeles to go out for 'a lovely dinner' with him . and his wife - until she insisted on staying at the expensive Beverly . Wilshire. But Ma tells a different story and reportedly showed the Post texts in which Stein wrote that he wanted to touch and kiss. 'When you get here i want to hug and kiss you. I understand you don’t want to f–k me. But i want to touch you and kiss you,' read one text. She texted back: 'Ben, you may hug me and feel my baby bump, but anything more is too much for me. I’m not your girlfriend. Can’t we simply enjoy a conversation and meal? I’m pregnant.' Then Stein responded, 'Your note hurts my feelings. Insulting. Shows zero appreciation.' On Monday, Stein denied to The Post that he ever did anything untoward. 'She is a person I have only met for less than five minutes at an airport. I have never touched her, I have never had any sexual contact with her. I should get a medal for helping this woman,' he said. Speaking previously to Business Insider, he had claimed that the story had only surfaced because he made 'the unfortunate mistake of meeting a very . vengeful human being who’s very angry that she did not get to stay at . the Beverly Wilshire'. He added . that he has been writing 'or at least 40 years about the interesting . people I meet' and that his 'secret gf' line had simply been a joke. But he admitted that he had communicated with the women after meeting them and did sometimes send them money. 'They don't even remotely have to be romantically involved with me for me to help them or communicate with them,' he said. Still, he claimed that his wife knew everything about his flirtations and found the latest press coverage funny. MailOnline had reached out to Stein's representative for comment and was awaiting a response. Well known: He famously appeared in the 1986 movie, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, as Bueller's teacher .","Ben Stein wrote a bizarre American Spectator column in June describing the beautiful women he met while on a speaking tour .

"Foreign jihadists from more than 80 countries have flocked to fight in Iraq and Syria on an 'unprecedented scale', according to extracts of a UN report. Around 15,000 people have travelled to fight alongside Islamic State (ISIS) and other hardcore militant groups from 'countries that have not previously faced challenges relating to Al Qaeda,' it said. The study found a new breed of terrorist was being attracted by the extremist group's 'cosmopolitan' use of social media, pointing to examples when jihadists posted 'kitten photographs' on Twitter. Cute: A UN report says 'unprecedented' numbers of jihadists are flocking to join ISIS in part thanks to the terror group's love of posting kitten photos on Twitter like this one on an account called Islamic State of Cat . Big softy: This picture posted by the Islamic State of Cat shows a kitten next to two AK-47 machine guns . The UN study found a new breed of terrorist was being attracted by the extremist group's 'cosmopolitan' use of social media, pointing to examples when jihadists posted 'kitten photographs' on Twitter . ISIS leaders recognise 'the terror and recruitment value of multi-channel, multi-language social and other media messaging,' it added. The number of foreign jihadists travelling to fight since 2010 exceeds the cumulative total of the 20 preceding years 'many times', the Security Council study found. 'There are instances of foreign terrorist fighters from France, the Russian Federation and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland operating together,' the report said, according to the Guardian. Britain's top police officer, Bernard Hogan-Howe, estimated last week that five people a week were leaving the country to fight with ISIS. Security officials estimate there are currently around 500 British nationals fighting in Syria and Iraq. A cat takes a rest among the parts of an assault rifle . The UN report said ISIS leaders recognise 'the terror and recruitment value of multi-channel, multi-language social and other media messaging' Dozens have been arrested for preparing to leave to join the IS group or helping others to do so. France is also moving closer to adopting an 'anti-terrorism' law which would slap a travel ban on anyone suspected of planning to wage jihad. The UN warned that more nations than ever face the problem of dealing with fighters returning from the battle zone. The US Central Intelligence Agency last month announced figures showing that there were around 20,000 to 31,500 ISIS fighters active in Iraq and Syria, much higher than previous estimates. Around 15,000 people have travelled to fight alongside Islamic State (ISIS) and other hardcore militant groups from 'countries that have not previously faced challenges relating to Al Qaeda,' the report said . The UN found that foreign fighters preferred ISIS's use of social media and were put off by the more dogmatic communication tactics of Al Qaeda . A US security official estimated that there were close to 2,000 westerners among the 15,000 foreign fighters. Previous figures showed there were 7,000 foreign jihadists fighting in March and 12,000 in July suggesting 1,000 a month were travelling to fight, despite the launch of U.S. air strikes three months ago, although there is a lag of a few weeks in the figures. The report was produced by a committee that monitors Al Qaeda and concluded that the once mighty and feared group was now 'maneuvering for relevance' following the rise of the even more militant ISIS, which was booted out of Al Qaeda by leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. Despite the split, the UN concluded that the legal basis for US President Barack Obama's fight against ISIS was justified by its ideological congruence with Al Qaeda and considered the two groups as part of a broader movement. Huge support: Fighters from the Islamic State march through their stronghold of Raqqa in Syria . 'Al Qaeda core and Isil (ISIS) pursue similar strategic goals, albeit with tactical differences regarding sequencing and substantive differences about personal leadership,' the UN wrote. Obama has vowed he will not order a large force into combat in Iraq or Syria, relying instead on air power and local forces. But his 'no boots on the ground' pledge is coming under pressure amid growing calls for advisers and forward air controllers to deploy with Iraqi or Kurdish soldiers to help direct air raids and plan operations. The ISIS group's 'cosmopolitan' use of social media, 'as when extremists post kitten photographs', was attracting a new breed of foreign fighters who are put off by the more dogmatic communication tactics of Al Qaeda, said the report. The UN agreed with the Obama administration that 'core al-Qaeda remains weak', but argued that its demise had only paved the way for more bloody groups, for whom 'cross-border attacks - or attacks against international targets - remain a minority.'","15,000 fighters from 80 countries have flocked to fight in Iraq and Syria .

"Facebook has revealed that the majority of photos which users flagged as 'offensive' during 2011 are actually just unflattering . Facebook has revealed that the majority of photos which users flagged as 'offensive' during 2011 are actually just ones people are embarassed about. The company revealed that no matter how much you dislike a photo, it won't take it down simply because you don't like how you like - or even if you're caught doing something you want to hide. When Facebook investigates an 'offensive' post, it will take it down only if it proves to be genuinely offensive. The company's engineering director, Arturo Bejar, revealed in a radio interview that the majority of reports of 'offensive' pictures in 2011 weren't actually offensive, when the company investigated - they're just pictures that people don't like. People don't own the copyright to photographs other people have taken of them, even on Facebook, so the site will not remove an image simply because someone doesn't like it. 'So we usually sit down with the people who process the reports as . they come in,' said Bejar. 'We're going for . photo after photo, and they're reported for violence or . drug use or pornography. 'And we're looking at the photos and we're . there's absolutely nothing wrong with that photo. That photo is fine.' 'Then we noticed that the . person who was reporting the photo happens to be in the photo. And so we . began digging.' There are more than 250 million photos posted to Facebook every day. In the interview, on NPR's 'Talk of the Nation', Bejar spoke to someone who wanted a photo of them at a political meeting removed in case it offended their boss. He said that Facebook would not remove photos for that reason, and advised the user to contact the photographer instead. Last year, so many people 'misused' the option to report 'Offensive' posts that Facebook added another option to the page, to allow miffed users to message their friends and ask them to take the pictures down. In the new version of the page, users are given the option to flag a picture as 'I don't like this picture of me,' or 'This picture is harassing me' which will send a message to the person who posted it. Facebook claims that this move helps people resolve picture problems. The blog AllThingsD commented, 'The thing is, you don’t necessarily own the rights to a picture someone else takes of you, and Facebook accentuates the awkwardness of that situation.' 'Since Facebook users upload an average of more than 250 million photos per day, this is a way for the company to patrol its site without employing warehouses full of people scanning pictures for violence and nudity.'","250 million photos posted to site every day .

"Another Miss USA contestant has claimed she heard a fellow competitor name the pageant's finalists before they were announced, reigniting the debate over whether the competition was rigged. It comes after Miss Pennsylvania vowed to stand by her accusations that Karina Brez, who was representing Florida, recited the top five women after seeing a list of their names backstage. The latest accuser, who has spoken on condition of anonymity, said Miss Brez had appeared 'very, very flustered and upset' as the top 15 girls were announced. Scroll down for video . Accusations: Miss Pennsylvania Sheena Monnin (left) said Miss Florida Karina Brez (right) said she had seen a list of the Miss USA finalists before they were called. Now another contestant has said she heard the same . 'I thought it might be because she didn’t make the top 15 cut, but at that point she was able to reveal to me at least four of the five names who went on to be the top girls,' the contestant told FOX News. 'She couldn’t remember the fifth because she was so upset. Several of the girls then started hearing through the grapevine about a list; a lot of people were upset.' She added that she would stand by Miss Pennsylvania, who is being sued by Miss Universe Organization co-owner Donald Trump over her claims. 'A lot of the girls now are very upset . about how Pennsylvania is being treated and aggressively attacked by an . organization that claims to empower women,' she said. She added that other women are scared to come forward in case they also face lawsuits, but 'if they had to testify in court, I’m . sure the girls would do it'. Miss Pennsylvania's Sheena Monnin first accused Miss Universe Organization of rigging the competition when she resigned from her position last week. Battle: Donald Trump, the co-owner of Miss Universe Organization, said he would sue Miss Monnin for her claims. She appeared on Today, right, to say she would not back down . Bitter: Miss Monnin looks on (right) as Trump addresses the crowd at the competition this summer. He has now said he never believed Miss Monnin would take the crown and it is a case of sour grapes . In a Facebook post announcing her resignation, she wrote: 'Apparently the morning of June 3rd [Brez] saw a folder lying open to a page that said 'FINAL SHOW Telecast, June 3, 2012' and she saw the places for Top 5 already filled in. 'After the Top 16 were called and we were standing backstage she hesitantly said to me and another contestant that she knew who the Top 5 were. I said 'who do you think they will be?' She said that she didn't 'think' she 'knew' because she saw the list that morning. 'She relayed whose names were on the list. Then we agreed to wait and see if that was indeed the Top 5 called that night. After it was indeed the Top 5 I knew the show must be rigged.' Miss Universe Organization vehemently denied the claims and said that Monnin had cited the new rules allowing transgender contestants as her reason for resigning. Donald Trump also denied the claims and said he would sue Monnin, who he believed was suffering 'loser's remorse'. 'I did see her for about a second. I never felt that she had a chance,' he told Today. Despite these legal threats, Monnin is standing by her accusations. Top five: Monnin claims another contestant told her Miss Ohio, Miss Maryland, Miss Rhode Island, Miss Nevada and Miss Georgia would be the top five before they were even read out . Deserved? After the 51 contestants were whittled down, Olivia Culpo from Rhode Island was named the winner . Good answer: Culpo, pictured with hosts Andy Cohen and Giuliana Rancic, impressed during the Q&A round . Well, she didn't know: Culpo is surrounded by fellow contestants after being crowned Miss USA . 'I know what I heard, and I know what I in turn witnessed... so I’m prepared to continue to march forward,' Monnin responded on Today. 'I feel an injustice has been done, not only to the other people who were not in the top five, but to the thousands of pageant girls across the country who competed, believing this is an honest system.' But Brez has also come forward to deny she made the claims seriously. 'Backstage during the pageant, I did see a piece of paper with names on it and like most people in such frenetic circumstances, joked that they must be the names of the final contestants,' Brez said. 'It was a throwaway comment, in the stress of the pageant, and was never meant as fact. The list I saw didn’t even have the eventual winner on it.' Monnin told Today she believes Brez changed her story out of fear. 'She looked a little bit scared because . she had just seen something that would potentially, drastically change . the reputation of the Miss Universe Organization,' she said. 'This is a big deal.' Top . ten: Monnin said the contestant told her about the discovery as the top . 16 were announced. But organizers have said she resigned because she . was against the new rule allowing transgender contestants . Discovery: Monnin claimed the unidentified contestant saw the top five list backstage before the show . The top 15 girls are decided by preliminary judging in the days before the broadcast, and fan voting determines the 16th. The top ten, top five and winner are decided in the live show, a rep said. The scores for the competition are believed to be entered into a computer system as the show is live. These results are monitored and verified by Ernst & Young. 'In accordance with the rules of the competition, Ernst & Young's tabulation of the judges' votes which determined the final five contestants did not occur until after the evening gown competition had been completed,' a representative said. Judge Joe Jonas tweeted after the accusations: 'All I can say... Is the Miss USA competition was NOT rigged. Miss [Rhode Island] USA won fair and square.' The pageant named Ms Culpo, a 20-year-old cellist, the winner after she made it clear that she embraced all beauty queens - transgender or otherwise - during the interview portion. In the dreaded final question round, Ms . Culpo was faced with the most difficult question of the night: Would it . be fair for a person born a man to be named Miss Universe after becoming . a woman? Final rounds: But organizers said the contestant denied telling Monnin she had seen any such list . Rearly lovely: The pageant was held at the Planet Hollywood casino on the Las Vegas Strip . Ms Culpo never stumbled as she embraced the Miss Universe Organization's recent decision to admit transgender contestants. 'I do think that would be fair,' she said. 'But I could understand how people could be apprehensive to take that road.' It is an opinion that Monnin does not share. In her resignation email, she wrote: 'I refuse to be part of a pageant system that has so far and so completely removed itself from its foundational principles as to allow and support natural born males to compete in it. 'This goes against ever moral fiber of my being.  I believe in integrity, high moral character, and fair play, none of which are part of this system any longer.' Ms Culpo will represent the United States at the 61st Miss Universe pageant later this year. An American has not been named Miss Universe since Brook Lee won the title in 1997. See below for video .

"A Victoria's Secret worker who had acid hurled in her face said her jealous childhood friend who attacked her spent years trying to emulate her looks. Naomi Oni said Mary Konye was 'obsessed' with her, attempting to steal her boyfriend before deciding to 'destroy her'. Miss Oni, 21, said Konye - who will be sentenced next month after being found guilty of the acid attack at Snaresbrook Crown Court last week - copied her clothes and hairstyle, even mimicking the way she spoke, her laugh and walk. Naomi Oni said Mary Konye, who had been her friend since the age of 11, had become 'obsessed' with her, trying to emulate her looks, trying to steal her boyfriend before attempting to 'destroy' her . Konye was said to obsessively jealous of the victim's good looks and, after a previous argument between them, hatched a plan to attack her with acid . Naomi Oni, also 21, was scarred for life after Konye doused her with concentrated sulphuric acid near her home in Dagenham, Essex . She told The Sun: 'If I wrote texts, spoke, laughed or walked in a certain way, she'd do that too. And she'd say ""I look just like you, don't I?"" 'If police hadn't caught her, I'm sure she would have gone on to kill.' On December 30, 2012 Konye, also 21, disguised herself in a Muslim veil to stalk her friend as she left the Victoria's Secret store in Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, east London, where she worked. Shortly before Miss Oni reached her home in Dagenham, Essex, Konye doused her with concentrated sulphuric acid, leaving her scarred for life. Mary Konye (pictured) stalked her friend after becoming jealous of her looks, it was said . CCTV . footage obtained by police after the attack showed Konye in a niqab . following her as she left at the lingerie shop at around 11.30pm. Konye faces jail after she was found guilty of the acid attack at Snaresbrook Crown Court last week. Miss Oni suffered serious burns to her face . and chest, lost her hair and eyelashes, and required skin graft surgery . to cover the burns. Miss Konye's obsession with her victim began when the friends were 11 years old. But in April 2011 they fell out after Miss Oni discovered Konye was trying to steal her boyfriend, sending him anonymous texts claiming Miss Oni was sleeping with other men. Miss Oni said: 'She had copied my entire life - now she wanted my boyfriend.' Giving evidence in court Miss Oni described how, on her way home, she got off at her bus . stop in Dagenham and felt a ‘presence’ before turning to . see someone in a niqab. She . then felt a ‘massive splash’ as the acid was thrown at her, disfiguring her face, dissolving her hair and eyelashes . and burning her tongue as she screamed. Describing . how she felt after the attack, she said: ‘Am I a bad person? Why has . this happened to me? I work hard ... No one’s going to marry me now.’ Miss . Oni also revealed that when she told her alleged attacker what had . happened, her friend texted back: ‘OMG. Can’t believe it.’ Naomi Oni suffered serious burns to her face and chest, lost her hair and eyelashes, and required skin graft surgery to cover the burns . She also cried down the phone to Konye, who offered her support. Miss Oni said in court: ‘I just had my bandages removed and it was the first time I saw . my  face after surgery and I broke down and I had spoken to Mary that . night  and I was crying on the phone to her and she was on the phone to . me telling me, “don’t worry, you’ll be OK”.’ She added: ‘I was still on the phone to . my boyfriend and I felt a presence. I turned to my left and I saw . someone and a black abaya [cloak] or a black niqab. ‘I remember it facing me, staring. A presence directly looking at me. All I could see was eyes.’ She then said she felt the splash as the acid was thrown in her face and ran home shouting ‘acid, acid’. Naomi Oni, pictured after the attack, speaking in an interview in which she said she was attacked by a person wearing a veil covering their face after getting off a bus in Lodge Avenue, Dagenham, on 30 December . She said: ‘I immediately felt that someone was trying to kill me and so my instinct was to run as fast as I could to get home. ‘I . felt, it wasn’t burning, it was a dissolving type of sensation. It was . on my face and I remember,  as I had my mouth open screaming, it burnt . my tongue.’ Mary Konye was born on 20 February . 1992 in Newham, east London. Her father died when she was just two . leaving her mother a single parent looking after her only child. She gained eight GCSEs before studying for A-Levels in Sociology, Media, . Business and Psychology at St Angela's Ursuline School, a Catholic . secondary school for girls in Forest Gate. She . spent another year at Southgate College doing A-Level retakes before . winning a place at the University of Hertfordshire, studied accounting . and finance in business. CCTV footage obtained by police after the attack showed a figure in a niqab following her as she left work at the Westfield shopping centre in Stratford at around 11.30pm . Konye held down jobs in retail at New Look, Forever 21 and Next while studying. She . was one term and an exam away from earning a BA honours degree when she . was arrested last April for throwing acid over Miss Oni. When she first appeared in court last May she applied on bail on the basis she was a regular churchgoer. Naomi Oni was born just nine days . earlier than Konye on 11 February 1992 and had a far less turbulent . childhood than her friend. Miss Oni pictured before the attack . They became friends from an . early age and Miss Oni, blessed with good looks, was encouraged by Konye . to pursue a career in modelling and the fashion industry. Miss Oni was less successful in her education and she dropped out of sixth form. She . found a job at Victoria's Secret lingerie store in Westfield Stratford . City and worked there full-time until Christmas 2013. She would often be put on late shifts, finishing at 11.30pm at night. The aspiring make-up artist was being chased by several admirers and rowed with Konye about the attention she was getting. After Miss Oni fell pregnant she confided in Konye that her boyfriend at the time, was not being supportive. Konye told him to provide the support Miss Oni needed. But Miss Oni was angered after learning that her friend had interfered with her relationship and the pair fell out. Six . months later they made up, but by then Konye had told college friends . at Southgate that she wanted to throw acid over Naomi and that she would . wear a niqab to disguise herself. After becoming friends in year 8 at St Angela's Ursuline School they had a 'typical' relationship during their teenage years. Both admitted during the trial they would regularly fall out but then patch up their differences.","Mary Konye became obsessed with Naomi Oni copying her clothes and style .

"Sarah Palin, the tea-party-darling former Alaska governor who ran for vice president in 2008, is leaving the door open for a presidential run in 2016, but mostly hawking a soon-to-premiere TV show. As the final speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference near Washington, Palin praised conservative leaders and trashed President Barack Obama, including a political smack-fest hidden in a Dr. Seuss-style children's rhyme. 'I do not like this, Uncle Sam. I do not like his health care scam,' she recited in a sing-song voice. 'I do not like these dirty crooks, or how they lie and cook the books. I do not like when Congress steals. I do not like their crony deals. I do not like this spying, man. I do not like ""Oh, yes we can.""' The effort won her cheers of 'Run, Sarah, Run!' from some of the more than 1,000 activists who stayed at the CPAC event until the bitter end. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Ted Cruz, an . extended-play effort to tie Obamacare's defunding to avoiding a partial . government shutdown. At one point Cruz read 'Green Eggs and Ham' to his . children over live television at their bedtime. Palin . fed red meat to her fans, insisting that 'Hope & Change,' and 'Yes . We can' has become 'No You Can't' under President Obama. 'No you can't log on to the website, no you can't keep your health . care, no you can't make a phone call without Michelle Obama knowing,' she jabbed. In between . snipes at the president's 'dopey wobbling on the world stage' and his . pledge that he had al-Qaeda on the run – 'yea, possibly toward us,' she . said – Palin carped about the White House's economic record and . projected a GOP-led future recovery enabled by tea party insurgents. 'Their . agenda is failure and fiasco on steroids,' she said of the Democratic . Party. 'So America is counting on the GOP to get it right.'

Obama 'promised jobs for the jobless, but fewer people work today than when the peanut farmer was president,' she said, referring to President Jimmy Carter's 1970s economic malaise. 'He promised to heal the planet, stop the rise of the oceans,' Palin mocked. 'But the planet is not listening to ""Dr. Obama.""' 'The only thing rising in his la-la land is the Russian empire.' 'I'm probably being too hard on the president,' she sniped. 'After all, who could have seen this coming?' Palin made headlines this week after Russian Vladimir Putin sent troops across the Ukrainian border into the Crimea region – a development she predicted in 2008 as a consequence of an Obama presidency, to a chorus of head-shaking from foreign-policy journalists. Ted Cruz read from the children's classic 'Green Eggs And Ham' during his Senate filibuster in 2013 -- an event that Palin reprised with anti-Obama rhymes in place of Dr. Seuss' verses. Palin is expected to deliver a crowd-pleasing red-meat speech to close the Conservative Political Action Conference . 'I'm usually not one to Told-Ya-So,' she gloated on Facebook, . 'but I did, despite my accurate prediction being derided as “an . extremely far-fetched scenario” by the “high-brow” Foreign Policy . magazine.

Ted Cruz, who placed second with 11 per cent. On Friday night, Palin appeared on the Fox News Channel, fielding questions about whether she has presidential ambitions of her own following her loss two presidential elections ago as a vice presidential nominee. 'It depends on what it is that Americans really, really want in a candidate,' the politician-turned-media-gadfly told host Greta van Susteren. 'If . they want a fighter, if they want someone who can so respect our . exceptionalism, everything that makes America great, the promise of . America. And if we don't find that, then I would run.'

But when van Susteren cornered Palin on her own White House ambitions, she said 'I'll never say never.' 'At . this point in time,' she cautioned, 'I don't have a team of people, you . know, getting out there doing these poll-tested – whatever they do – to . let you know if you should run or not.

Four years later, she resigned her job as Alaska governor, citing the expense and distraction of fighting 'frivolous' ethics charges related to the firing of the state's public safety commissioner. Still, her statewide approval ratings never dipped below 53 per cent. Palin's name is everywhere at the CPAC event, from giving the annual event's final speech to promoting the April premiere of her new show 'Amazing America' on the Sportsman Channel. In another Fox News appearance in March, she slammed President Obama for what she said was a tepid response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine's Crimea region. 'People are looking at Putin as one who wrestles bears and drills for oil,' Palin told host Sean Hannity.

"The girlfriend of New England Patriots footballer Aaron Hernandez was in court today accused of lying about the disposal of evidence in the murder case against him. Standing just feet from relatives of Odin Lloyd, who was shot dead in June, Shayanna Jenkins pleaded not guilty to a single charge of perjury for allegedly lying to a Massachusetts grand jury. The 24-year-old, said to have a 'don't ask don't tell' relationship with Hernandez, is accused of lying at a hearing in August about where she threw a box he allegedly asked her to 'get rid of' after Mr Lloyd's murder, Bristol County Assistant District Attorney Patrick Bomberg said. Charges: Shayanna Jenkins has been accused of perjury in the murder case against Aaron Hernandez . Grief: Ursula Ward, whose son Odin was shot dead, wipes away tears in the Massachusetts court as she listens to Jenkins' testimony . Jenkins is also accused of falsely telling police that Mr Lloyd, who was dating her sister, dealt drugs, prosecutors said. She initially invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, but was later granted immunity for her testimony, Mr Bomberg said. Hernandez, 23, has pleaded not guilty to the murder on June 17 of Mr Lloyd, a 27-year-old semi-professional footballer from Boston. He is being held without bail. Mr Lloyd's body was found near the North Attleborough home Jenkins and Hernandez shared with their infant daughter, according to Boston.com. His mother, Ursula Ward, was seen to wipe away tears in the courtroom as she listened to testimony from Jenkins. In court on Tuesday, Mr Bomberg said that the day after Mr Lloyd was killed, Jenkins retrieved a box from the basement of the home she shared with Hernandez in North Attleborough, Massachusetts, put it in a trash bag, covered it with baby clothes and drove away with it. Accused: New England Patriots footballer Aaron Hernandez is facing murder and gun charges . Jenkins repeatedly told grand jurors she threw the box in a dumpster but couldn't recall where, according to Mr Bomberg. The attorney did not say what is believed to have been in the box. Hernandez's associate Carlos Ortiz, who is charged as an accessory in the case, has told investigators the professional footballer put firearms in a box in his basement after the killing, according to court records. Victim: Semi-professional footballer Odin Lloyd was shot dead in June . Prosecutors have said the murder weapon has not been found. Jenkins, who has turned up to support Hernandez at his court hearings, also allegedly denied asking her maids to sign non-disclosure agreements after Mr Lloyd's death, the Courant reported. The maids, who reported seeing guns at the house, later testified before the grand jury that Jenkins did ask them to sign documents, copies of which have been submitted as evidence, Mr Bomberg said. Defense attorney Janice Bassil said Jenkins answered every question asked of her before the grand jury and that prosecutors were overreaching with the perjury charge. She said there is no evidence Jenkins lied and that prosecutors sought the indictment simply because they didn't believe her. She called lead prosecutor William McCauley's questioning of Jenkins 'extremely aggressive' and heavy-handed. Ms Bassil described the relationship between Jenkins and Hernandez, who have a child together, as one of 'don't ask, don't tell'. She claimed that style of relationship, where couples share only parts of their lives with each other, was common among sports figures and entertainers. The perjury charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years. Prosecutors have asked the judge assigned to the Hernandez case, Susan Garsh, to recuse herself, saying she and Mr McCauley have a 'well-known and publicly documented history of antagonism' stemming from a 2010 murder trial he argued before her. Mr McCauley won a conviction in that case but was quoted in the press as criticizing Judge Garsh, saying she had unfairly limited or excluded evidence and exhibited antagonism. A hearing on the request is scheduled for Monday. Three others face charges in the Hernandez case. Ernest Wallace and Ortiz, who prosecutors say were with Hernandez and Mr Lloyd in a car on the night Mr Lloyd was killed, have been charged with being an accessory to murder after the fact. Wallace has pleaded not guilty and is being held on $500,000 bail. Ortiz is scheduled to be arraigned on Friday. Hernandez's cousin, Tanya Singleton, has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit accessory after the fact and criminal contempt. Prosecutors say she refused to testify before the grand jury even though she was offered immunity. Perjury: Shayanna Jenkins is accused of lying about helping to dispose of a box after Mr Lloyd's murder . Relationship: Jenkins was said to have a 'don't ask don't tell' arrangement with boyfriend Hernandez, the court was told . Hernandez has also been linked to an investigation into a double homicide in Boston in 2012. While investigating Mr Lloyd's death, police found a SUV rented in Hernandez's name at the home of his uncle, which was wanted in connection with those killings. Jenkins was released on personal recognizance . during her arraignment in Fall River Superior Court on a single perjury . count. Prosecutors had sought $5,000 cash bail. She is due back in court for a pre-trial conference on November 6.","Couple had 'don't ask don't tell' relationship arrangement .

"The White House and the Health & Human Services Department boasted Wednesday that 3.3 million Americans have signed up for private insurance coverage through marketplaces set up by the Affordable Care Act. But the administration still hasn't said a word about how many – or how few – of those signing up on the chronically ill healthcare.gov website have paid for their insurance, and are actually covered. A MailOnline analysis of publicly available totals from five states that run their own health insurance exchanges found that on average, just 66.5 per cent of enrollees in those states have paid premiums. If that proportion holds nationwide, the total number of Americans who are actually covered by private insurance because of Obamacare is less than 2.2 million. Bucking up the troops? President Obama has delivered speeches to groups of Obamacare enrollment advocates, but they haven't come through enough to breed widespread optimism about the Affordable Care Act . Political land mine: Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers Jason Furman caught reporters' spears last week after a Congressional Budget Office report found that millions of jobs would be lost because of the president's health care law . At least five states provide such statistics on their own enrollees, showing that the numbers are, or ought to be, generally obtainable. A quarterly report published Wednesday by HHS announced that 'to date, 3.3 million persons have selected a Marketplace plan during the first four months of the initial open enrollment period, including 1.4 million in SBMs [state-based marketplaces] and 1.9 million in the FFM [federally facilitated marketplace].' But HHS conceded that its numbers 'include those who have paid a premium and those who have not yet paid a premium, regardless of when their coverage begins.' 'Enrollment is measured as those who selected a plan,' an HHS press release confirms. Similar disclaimers are offered some 20 times in the HHS report, both in its text and in accompanying graphs. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services spokesman Aaron Albright told MailOnline that his agency hasn't 'prioritized' reporting payment statistics, but plans to 'once our automated . payment systems are completed and fully tested.' At least five states, though, have already figured out how to do it. Press releases from health insurance exchanges in the states MailOnline sampled, including populous New York and California, show that 966,312 Americans have selected Obamacare plans there. Of those, 642,979 have paid for at least one month of insurance coverage. The state-by-state number are all over the map. Eighty-five per cent of Rhode Island's enrollees have paid first-month's premiums. That percentage was about 75 in California, 66 in Nevada, 59 in New York and a dismal 51.5 per cent in the state of Washington. No longer to blame: Obamacare's disastrous early months were blamed on a deeply flawed website, but failure at the March 31 finish line will fall squarely on the White House . Spin cycle: White House press secretary Jay Carney took a break Tuesday night from defending Obamacare, escorting his wife, ABC News reporter Claire Shipman, to the State Dinner in honor of French President Francois Hollande . The Obama administration said 25 per cent of the national enrollment total are Americans between the ages of 18 and 34, a far cry from the roughly 40 per cent economics say must enroll in order to avoid a 'death spiral' for Obamacare. The program's economics depend heavily on the presumption that a flood of younger, healthier people will contribute premium dollars in order to offset the cost of medical care for the old and sick. But with minimal fines – starting at just $95 this year – and widespread recognition that the IRS can only collect the penalty from Americans who are due an income tax refund, many young people are opting out. And early technical glitches and wholesale disasters plagued healthcare.gov as well as some of the state-based exchanges. Oregon's, for instance, is still not functional after a nearly five-month delay. Consumers have until Feb. 15 to select a plan if they want to be covered by March 1. But HHS quietly announced this week that on Saturday, the deadline day, a Social Security Administration computer system used to screen applicants for eligibility will be offline for long-planned annual maintenance.","White House won't comment on payment statistics for Obamacare plans, relying on numbers of 'selected plans' as a proxy .

Million-dollar baby: Jennifer Huculak-Kimmel gave birth to her daughter Reece nine weeks early while on holiday in Hawaii last December . Huculak-Kimmel, suffering from a ruptured membrane, said she tried everything possible to get back to Canada with her husband. 'We looked at all avenues to trying to get medevac (an air ambulance) home,' she said. 'One medevac company would not fly me in my condition and the other one would only do it with a surgical team on board and still recommended me not travel.' 'I spent six weeks on bed rest and then baby Reece was delivered by emergency C-section on December 10th.' Her baby daughter had to be hospitalized for two months and the couple were hit with a $950,000 bill. Jennifer Huculak-Kimmel, from Saskatchewan, gave birth to her daughter Reece nine weeks early while on holiday in Hawaii last December. No insurance: Blue Cross denied payment and in a letter to the family wrote: 'We are unable to provide coverage for any medical expenses incurred for Ms. Huculak's baby' Huculak-Kimmel told CBC Radio the insurance company denied her coverage because it said she had a pre-existing medical condition. Huculak-Kimmel had a bladder infection four months into her pregnancy, which caused bleeding long before the trip. Blue Cross argued that earlier bladder infection made her pregnancy high-risk. She says, four days before her trip, her specialist gave her an ultrasound and cleared her to fly. 'He saw no reason for me not to go,' she says. 'He felt that my pregnancy was stable.' Huculak-Kimmel adds that when she bought the Blue Cross insurance, the salesperson told her she was OK to travel because she was less than 36 weeks pregnant. 'I guess we thought we had done everything right,' she says. Specialists in Hawaii told the new mother that there is no cause for a ruptured membrane, she says, although they speculated that the long flight could have been a factor. In a letter to the family Blue Cross denied payment and wrote: 'We are unable to provide coverage for any medical expenses incurred for Ms. Huculak's baby'. They added 'please note that Ms. Huculak's travel policy expired on Nov. 9, 2013.' Huculak-Kimmel told CTV News the Blue Cross pamphlet had no fine print explaining any rules for pre-existing conditions. She said the family is now trying to decide if they should fight Blue Cross, declare bankruptcy.","Jennifer Huculak-Kimmel gave birth nine weeks early while on holiday in Hawaii last December .

"Liquid refreshment: Experts say water is the only liquid our bodies need to hydrate . Drinking water instead of fizzy drinks could dramatically reduce your chances of developing Type 2 diabetes, scientists say. Researchers from Harvard University are presenting new evidence which shows replacing sugar-sweetened drinks with water can lead to weight loss and help reduce the risk of Type 2 diabetes by seven per cent. Professor Frank Hu, from the Harvard School of Public Health, said: 'There is convincing evidence that regular consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is associated with increased risk of obesity and diabetes, and emerging evidence that these beverages increase the risk for heart disease. 'To reduce risk of obesity and cardiometabolic diseases, it is important to reduce consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and replace them with healthier choices such as water and unsweetened tea or coffee.' More than 2.8 million people in the UK have the chronic condition of diabetes, while another one million have it without realising, according to NHS figures. People who develop the Type 2 condition lose the ability to break down glucose into energy, which causes blood-sugar levels to rise. The immediate symptoms of hyperglycaemia include feeling thirsty and drowsy. It can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which can eventually cause unconsciousness and even death. Diabetes raises the risk of heart disease by up to five times. Over time it can cause sight problems and nerve damage leading to foot ulcers. Patients are encouraged to exercise more and eat a healthier diet to help control the condition. Diabetes UK says 10 per cent of total NHS spending goes towards treating the condition and its complications. The International Chair on Cardiometabolic Risk (ICCR), which conducted the research, says more than 100,000 people are diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes every year, with 26 million Brits projected to be obese by 2030. ICCR scientific director, Dr Jean-Pierre Despres said: 'The epidemic prevalence achieved by abdominal obesity can be explained by our sedentary lifestyle and poor nutritional habits, among which an overconsumption of sugar-sweetened beverages plays a significant role. 'Until recently, these beverages have escaped the scrutiny that low-quality foods have received, but as our research shows, this certainly should not be the case.' Kinvara Carey, general manager at the Natural Hydration Council, said: 'With the rising concern about obesity rates, it is useful to remind people of simple steps that can help us all towards a healthier lifestyle. 'Taking notice of what we drink can be just as important as watching what we eat. Water is the only liquid our bodies need to hydrate. It contains no calories or other added ingredients and, as such, is one of the healthiest ways to hydrate.' The findings were published today at the Sustaining the Blue Planet: Global Water Education Conference in Montana, USA.

"Chinese doctors claim to have diagnosed a new mental illness - porn traumatic stress disorder. The condition was defined after examining the case of a teenager who says his life was ruined by being exposed to pornography from the age of five. Lei Chung, 16, used to live with his mother and father in a tiny one bedroom flat in the city of Dongguan in southern China's Guangdong Province. Lei Chung, 16, has been diagnosed with what doctors say is a new mental illness - porn traumatic stress disorder. The condition was defined after the teenager said his life had been ruined by being exposed to pornography from the age of five . He claims that at the age of five, he would lie awake at night and stare at his father using the computer on the table next to his bed to watch porn movies. He told doctors: 'I tried not to look, but there were always these noises - and when I did look I couldn't get the images out of my head.' He claims that when he asked his father not to watch such material, he had beaten him, and the situation at home had become even worse. The images have haunted him ever since. It is reported that despite starting out well at school, he was unable to get the graphic images out of his head. As a result, his school work suffered, leading to him eventually dropping out. He was also unable to get a job because the porn images had constantly been floating around in his mind. His despair at the graphic images inside his mind led to him quitting school and trying to commit suicide . In the end he tried to commit suicide, but was persuaded out of it by a friend who urged him to seek medical advice. Doctors have now confirmed the pornographic films that have haunted the boy through his life are to blame for his suffering. However instead of post-traumatic stress disorder, they have branded it porn traumatic stress disorder. Doctor Yi Tu, who has been treating Lei, said: 'It is a clear case proving that the exposure of young children to pornographic material before they really have the capacity to understand it is seriously damaging to their mental health. 'Parents should take steps to make sure children are not exposed to this sort of imagery and especially not at such a young age.'","Lei Chung, 16, from China, had to share a bedroom with his parents .

"A Russian footballer has been heavily criticized for hiring a muzzled bear wearing a tie to perform at his two-year-old son's birthday party. Midfielder Kirill Kombarov, 27, currently plays for FC Torpedo Moscow on loan from Spartak Moscow in the Russian Premier League. But he is now the focus of media attention because of photos he posted on the internet of his son's birthday party, which show a live bear performing while wearing a tie and muzzle. The huge bear was hired from a local circus for Russian footballer Kirill Kombarov's son's birthday (pictured) Timofei, aged 2, even posed for photos with his mother and father while sitting on it like a horse . The footballer hired the bear from the Stepan Nikulin circus after seeing it perform on television and deciding it would be the perfect way to make it a birthday party to remember for his youngest son. Kombarov he is the identical twin brother of footballer Dmitri Kombarov, who plays as a left-back for Spartak Moscow. The bear has already appeared in several films and the circus confirmed it did make it available for private parties. The pictures show the massive bear fitted with a muzzle and, in one of them, the boy Timofei is seen riding on the back of the gigantic beast. It includes the caption from the footballer himself, saying: 'Happy birthday Timofei.' But the pictures generated massive criticism for the 27-year-old player, based in the Russian capital Moscow, who has failed to impress so far in the current season, scoring no goals in seven matches, but nevertheless managing to notch up two yellow cards. One Twitter user Ivan Abdulov posted: 'A great role model for the fairer treatment of animals.' Another, Isolde Yevdokimova, said: 'Foolish - bears are not house pets.'

"Arsene Wenger will subject his players to a video nasty of their 3-1 Champions League home defeat by Monaco after admitting it was painful to watch what has been described as one of Arsenal’s worst performances in his 17 years at the club. With Gary Lineker leading the criticism, calling the display ‘beyond amateurish’, Wenger says he will go over the basic defensive errors with the team, with Arsenal caught three times on the break. On Sunday, Wenger’s team take on Everton, fresh from their Europa League triumph on Thursday, and though Arsenal have won five out of the last six Premier League games, the team will have to win over a potentially mutinous Emirates Stadium.

Wenger conceded that reviewing the Monaco game was difficult given the number of basic errors his team had made. ‘I haven’t shown the tape to the players yet,’ he said. ‘I have watched it myself. It is always hard. It is hard to see that you make mistakes.’ Wenger insisted he would maintain his focus, dismissing Lineker’s analysis as over the top. ‘The comments are always extreme, he said. ‘I let people talk and I don’t talk too much. What is important is to give a strong response. ‘I love to win and when I don’t win I’m hurt. But the defeat hurts more than the criticism.’ In a further blow, Wenger revealed that Jack Wilshere has had fresh surgery to relieve some irritation on his injured ankle, so he will be out for at least two weeks.

Wenger added: ‘The match on Sunday is a different competition and it is important we continue our run in the Premier League.’ Striker Olivier Giroud will be under pressure after a series of misses.

"This is the terrifying moment a  Russian politician thought she was going to be burned alive when she was surrounded by masked men and covered in oil. Irina Komissar, 31, the former official of internal politics and information in the city of Zaporozhye, south-eastern  Ukraine, had just stepped out of her car when she was suddenly approached by a group of men wearing balaclavas and army camouflage. In their hands, they carried what appeared to be a flammable liquid. Scroll down for video .

Miss Komissar, who is visibly terrified, is then held while they cover her with the oil and tip a bag of feathers over her head. Recording the whole incident on a mobile phone, they then left the scene and later posted the video online.

"Chelsea failed to win for only the third time in the Premier League season as Sunderland held Jose Mourinho's men to a goalless draw at the Stadium of Light.

Disciplined without being spectacular and played his part in gaining the point. Sunderland forward Connor Wickham was a constant menace against Chelsea . Jack Rodwell 6.5 . Showing signs of improvement after sluggish start to season. Nipped by opponents on couple of occasions and was strong in the tackle. Connor Wickham 7 . Best attacking threat, escaping down the left on numerous occasions. Was denied by Courtois with stinging drive in second half. Did well. Steven Fletcher 6 . Afforded precious little of the ball but worked manfully before withdrawal midway through second half. Subs . Jozy Altidore 6. On 62. Was a handful and might have forced a winner late on.

"A NSW state Labor Party candidate could be dumped just five days after being pre-selected after comments were published in which he appeared to warn female migrants about the risks of reporting domestic violence to police. Susai Benjamin has the backing of ALP heavyweights for a seat in western Sydney but his candidacy has been called into question over an article that appeared in the Law Society Journal in March 2012, in which he said there was a misunderstanding among women who had recently arrived in Australia that police act as counsellors in domestic abuse cases. 'For example, some wives think that they can call the police, and the police will come and warn their husbands not to be violent, but instead the police, when they come, arrest and charge them,' Mr Benjamin said. 'This leads to a total breakdown of the family relationships.' Newly endorsed Australian Labor Party candidate Susai Benjamin is facing a backlash over his comments on domestic violence . Mr Benjamin, a solicitor and barrister, is part of the Toongabbie Legal Centre in Sydney's western suburbs, a community-based legal centre which provides free legal advice and information 'to those who cannot afford to pay private lawyers and for those who do not know where to go when they encounter a legal problem'. At first Mr Benjamin called the matter 'just a storm in a tea cup' and refused to recant the views he expressed in the article. But on Monday, he told Daily Mail Australia that 'my position is that domestic violence is not acceptable under any circumstances'. 'It's just that for some communities we need better education about the role of police and how they act in terms of domestic violence,' he said. 'People should report domestic violence to police, no ifs or buts, but sometimes they are told they should not have called them about an argument and then it is too late to make alterations.' Advocacy groups say Western Sydney has one of the country's worst rates of domestic violence . His reported views have caused dismay within his own party and anti-domestic violence campaigners. Mr Benjamin's pre-selection for the seat vacated by former NSW Premier Nathan Rees was backed by Labor Party heavyweights including federal MPs Laurie Ferguson and Julie Owens, and State MP Lynda Voltz, who come from the party's Left faction. Mr Ferguson, however, remains a staunch supporter despite the controversy. 'It's true that some cultural differences do not translate here and I don't agree with some of the comments he made,' Mr Ferguson said. 'Yes he could have chosen his words a bit better but while he said them (the words) he definitely would not practice those things himself. 'This is just an internal agenda issue - all part of a smear campaign by his detractors but he has been re-endorsed by the executive. 'He has very strong support within the rank and file.' Mr Benjamin was pre-selected unopposed for the seat but has yet to be formally advised of his endorsement. He expects that to occur within the next day. 'With any political party, there are some people who vote for me, some who won't - that's the nature of the business, some love you and some hate you,' he said. 'There was the chance for others to nominate but I was the only one. It has been a four-month process and the party has come to the conclusion that I should be endorsed. 'There are people in the party who wouldn't like me to be the candidate.' Karen Willis from Rape and Domestic Violence Services Australia says Mr Benjamin's comments are 'out of step with the rest of the community' Labor Party sources have confirmed that his candidature has gone before both the internal Candidate Review Panel and an Administrative Committee and they say he would have been axed had he not had the support of some of the country's most influential ALP politicians. A party insider has told Daily Mail Australia: 'Just about everyone in the party agrees this (his pre-selection) is not a good idea. 'Several senior party members have made it clear they are very uncomfortable with his pre-selection on the basis of his views and want to get rid of him somehow without upsetting those who backed him in.' Karen Willis from Rape and Domestic Violence Services Australia said his comments 'are not in keeping with the views of the majority of his party colleagues'. 'More particularly though these views are totally out of step with the broader community. 'He obviously does not understand it is quite simply a criminal act, there is no excuse for domestic violence. 'What is of most concern is that he is seeking to represent an area which suffers some of the highest levels of domestic violence in this country,' she said. This controversy comes just a week after drama gripped Victorian politics. Liberal Party member Jack Lyons was forced to resign from his seat in Bendigo West after racist and sexist comments posted on social media were brought to light, while Aaron Lane stepped out of the running for Western Victoria after homophobic comments on Twitter posted by the endorsed candidate were discovered.","Comments made by Susai Benjamin in 2012 have put his pre-selection for a NSW state seat in jeopardy .

"A man who claims Chicago police tortured him until he confessed to a rape he didn't commit walked out of jail smiling Wednesday, a free man for the first time in 30 years. Stanley Wrice, 59, gave a thumbs up as he was released from the Pontiac Correctional Center after Cook County Judge Richard Walsh overturned his conviction this week saying officers lied about how they treated him. The ruling was just the latest development in one of the darkest chapters of Chicago Police Department history, in which officers working under former Lt. Jon Burge were accused of torturing suspects into false confessions and torturing witnesses into falsely implicating people in crimes. Freed: Stanley Wrice, 59, is all smiles and is greeted with applause as he walks out of Pontiac Correctional Center on Wednesday after serving 30 years for a crime he confessed to after being tortured by police . Big smiles: Wrice has been granted a new trial after a judge ruled that officers who performed his 1982 interrogation lied about their conduct. Here, Wrice smiles with his layer Heidi Linn Lambros, left, and his daughter Gail Lewis . Not alone: Wrice was sentenced to 100 yeas in prison in 1982 after he says two former officers beat him with a flashlight and a 20-inch piece of rubber ¿ the same weapons, lawyers say the two implicated cops used on others . Wrice has insisted for years that he confessed to the 1982 sexual assault after officers beat him in the groin and face. And a witness testified at a hearing Tuesday that he falsely implicated Wrice in the rape after two Chicago police officers under Burge's command tortured him. Wrice was sentenced to 100 years in prison. One of Wrice's attorneys, Heidi Linn . Lambros, said that when Walsh's ruling was announced, Wrice 'squeezed my . hand and looked at me with tears in his eyes and said he owed me a . dollar,' a reference to the bet she made with Wrice recently that she . would have him home by Christmas. Past: It is the latest development in one of the darkest chapters of Chicago Police Department history, in which officers working under former Lt. Jon Burge, pictured, were accused of torturing suspects into false confessions . Now . that Walsh has ordered Wrice's release, it will be up to a special . prosecutor to decide whether to retry him. The special prosecutor did . not return a call seeking comment Tuesday evening. With . his release, Wrice will join a number of men who in recent years have . been released from prison because they were tortured into confessing at . the hands of Burge's men. Dozens . of men - almost all of them black - have claimed that, starting in the . 1970s, Burge and his officers beat or shocked them into confessing to . crimes ranging from armed robbery to murder. Ongoing: Stanley Wrice walks free after 30 years, accompanied by his son-in-law Cashell Lewis, left, and his attorney Jennifer Bonjean. The officers implicated in the case refused to testify at Tuesday's hearing, citing their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination . Thumbs up: Wrice drove away into a world that has changed in innumerable ways since he was put away in 1982 . Wrice testified Tuesday that two former officers beat him with a flashlight and a 20-inch piece of rubber - the same weapons, Lambros said, that others have said the two used on them to get them to confess to crimes or implicate others in crimes they did not commit. The officers refused to testify at Tuesday's hearing, citing their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. No Chicago police officers have ever been convicted of torturing suspects, but Burge was convicted in 2010 for lying in a civil suit when he said he'd never witnessed or participated in the torture of suspects. He is serving a 4 1/2-year sentence in federal prison for perjury and obstruction of justice. Chicago also has paid out millions of dollars to settle lawsuits in cases related to Burge. The torture allegations also were a factor in former Illinois Gov. George Ryan's decision to institute a moratorium on the death penalty in 2000. Gov. Pat Quinn abolished the death penalty in 2011. Emotional: Wrice appeared to wipe away tears as he stood on the free side of Pontiac Correctional Center for the first time in 30 years on Wednesday . Top of the world: Wrice had only a box of possessions with him as he walked out of prison on Wednesday. Wrice joins a number of men who in recent years have been released from prison because they were tortured into confessing at the hands of Burge's men .","Stanley Wrice was released Wednesday from an Illinois prison after 30 years .

"Britain's winters are getting colder because of melting Artic ice changing global weather patterns, the Met Office has claimed. Forecasters are concerned that high . levels of ice melt in the Arctic in recent years could be behind Britain’s increasingly bitter and longer winters. The organisation’s leading climate . change expert, Dr Julia Slingo, is to convene experts from around the . world to establish whether this explains why Britain has been . experiencing the coldest temperatures for almost 100 years. Springtime in London: April snow showers in Kensington Gardens come amid Met Office claims that high levels of ice melt in the Arctic in recent years could be responsible for Britain's bitter winters . Jet streams are belts of fast flowing air found in the atmosphere which are formed near air masses with significantly different temperatures. They are responsible for moving weather around the latitudes. The Polar jet stream affects the UK, and tends to be further south in the winter and further north in the summer. Recently, the jet stream has been further south - which is why the UK has experienced wet summers. This winter, the jet stream split in two - part of the belt was at the bottom of the Mediterranean, and the other part was sitting at the north of the UK. A band of high pressure blocked its path meaning the cold weather conditions stuck. Figures released yesterday revealed that the temperature in Aberdeenshire fell to -11.2 degrees Celsius on April 2 – this is the lowest recorded April temperature for almost 100 years. The news comes just after it was revealed that Britain also experienced the coldest March since 1962. Dr Slingo is concerned that shrinking sea ice in the Arctic could be responsible. ‘If this is how climate change could manifest itself, then we need to understand that as a matter of urgency,’ she told ITV News. There are a number of theories as to how melting Arctic ice could affect British weather. One view is that the warming of the Arctic has the effect of reducing the jet stream – the fast-moving river of warm air which controls our weather patterns – and that this could cause Britain to be subjected to longer periods of unmoving weather, such as the cold weather that has recently affected the country. This winter, the jet stream split in two - part of the belt was at the bottom of the Mediterranean, and the other part was sitting at the north of the UK. This caused the prolonged period of very cold weather . If the Arctic experiences rapid ice melt then a large amount of very cold water is released into the ocean. This cold water can disrupt the normal path of the jet stream which usually keeps Britain much warmer than its latitude suggests it should be. As a result, we can be subjected to much colder weather than normal. Dr Jennifer Francis, a research professor at the Institute of Marine and Coastal Sciences, told ITV News that the UK's geographical position makes it particularly vulnerable to changes in the Arctic. The Met Office is organising an urgent meeting of climate change experts to discuss whether melting Arctic ice is changing Britain's weather . Britain experienced the coldest March since 1962 with temperatures across the country failing to reach average figures .","Dr Julia Slingo at the Met Office calling a meeting of world climate experts .

"Joe Ledley hailed the courage of his Crystal Palace captain Mile Jedinak following the death of Australian Test batsman Phillip Hughes. Socceroos skipper Jedinak paid his own personal tribute to compatriot Hughes before Palace's 1-1 draw at Swansea on Saturday when he carried out a cricket bat, which he placed along with a ball and a pair of caps on the touchline. Hughes, 25, died on Thursday after being struck on his head by a ball while batting for South Australia in a Sheffield Shield game in Sydney. Crystal Palace's Australian skipper Mile Jedinak walks out with a bat at the Liberty Stadium . Crystal Palace captain Jedinak held a cricket bat to celebrate the life of his fellow countryman . Jedinak lays a cricket bat on the pitch in tribute to Australian cricketer Hughes . Jedinak made the poignant pre-match tribute and then scored from the penalty spot - his fifth goal in eight games - as Palace fought back to earn a prized Barclays Premier League point at the Liberty Stadium. 'Everyone in Australia is devastated by what happened, especially Mile being the captain of the Australia football team,' said Jedinak's midfield colleague Ledley. 'That goal obviously meant a lot to Mile and we're all behind him. It's been a difficult time for him but to go out there and play like he has done is fantastic. 'He's determined as ever and it didn't affect his performance at all. He's done exactly the same in training because he's a strong guy and personality and he's been strong all week.' Palace endured a torrid opening spell when Swansea's superiority was complete and finally reflected on the scoreline after 15 minutes when Wilfried Bony netted his sixth goal in seven Premier League games with a sharp shot on the turn. But Palace levelled 10 minutes later when Jonjo Shelvey's clumsy challenge on Marouane Chamakh allowed Jedinak to score from the spot and Neil Warnock's side grew into the game after that. Joe Ledley, pictured celebrating alongside Jedinak, praised his captain following his crucial goal . 'We did the same against Liverpool, we didn't start that well but we ended up coming into the game,' Ledley said. 'They had a good start but from there I thought it was 50-50 and on another day we could have gone on and nicked it on the counter-attack. 'It was a good point for us and that's what we needed after beating Liverpool. 'But everyone's determined and works their socks off here - the back four, midfield, wingers and strikers. 'Everyone in the team knows they've got to put a shift in or they'll be off, so every week we need to go out there and perform.' Palace's fightback means Swansea have now lost 13 points from winning positions this season but defender Neil Taylor insists that worrying trait has not damaged dressing-room morale. Neil Taylor (right) hopes his side can get back to winning ways when Swansea host QPR on Tuesday . 'This is football, it always has to go one way,' Taylor said. 'This is a stat that people can talk about but this is the way it can go. You just carry on, it's not the fact of managing the game. 'We've just scored early and we should have made it two or three, but we didn't and that's it.' Swansea are at home again on Tuesday night when they entertain a Queens Park Rangers side who climbed off the bottom of the league on Saturday with a 3-2 victory over Leicester. 'If we play well and win then this result is forgotten about,' Taylor said. 'It won't be an easy game but it's a home game and hopefully we can go one better than this one. 'Our play in the first half was unbelievable and if we'd finished a couple of those chances we would have been out of sight. 'We need to capitalise on our chances because at 1-0 games are never finished and you have to try and get another one.'","Mile Jedinak scored Crystal Palace's equaliser against Swansea .

"Iran is rolling out a domestically-produced version of its own drone following the capture of a U.S.-made Scan Eagle last December, state television has claimed. According to reports, the country's military has successfully reverse engineered the avionics to replicate the U.S. drone and is producing them on a mass scale. According to Rear Admiral Ali Fadavi, Commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps Navy, the Iran's Naval and Aerospace Division has already deployed the home-brew models. Claims: Iran's military said it had downed a U.S. Scan Eagle drone, similar to the one pictured, which is a low-cost unmanned surveillance craft . His comments regarding the production . start up reportedly came on December 17, less than two weeks after the . drone was supposedly captured of the Iranian coast on December 4. The Revolutionary Guards said they had . brought down a ScanEagle - one of the low-cost, long-endurance aircraft . with a 10ft wingspan which is operated by the U.S.. Rear Admiral Ali Fadavi told the Fars . news agency in December that the drone had conducted several . reconnaissance flights over the Gulf in recent days. Rear Adm Fadavi said that 'such drones are usually launched from large warships. Shockwaves: Claims that the Iranian Arms had managed to create its own squadron of drones based on technology copied from a 'downed' U.S. spy plane is likely to cause acute embarrassment for the Americans . At the time, a spokesman for U.S. Naval Forces Central Command in Bahrain said the U.S. Navy had no record of any recently lost ScanEagles. A month before this claimed downing of the drone, the U.S. said Iranian warplanes had shot at a its surveillance drone flying in international airspace. Iran said the aircraft had entered its airspace. A year ago, Iranian TV broadcast pictures of an American RQ-170 Sentinel surveillance drone that Iran said had been brought down using electronic warfare. The US said it had malfunctioned. Iran rejected a U.S. call for the return of the drone. It subsequently claimed to have developed its own unmanned drone.

A source close to the Tory donor told the Daily Mail: ‘Lord Ashcroft is still a Tory but, he wonders, is Cameron?’ The source, himself a Tory donor, added: ‘Ashcroft does not agree with Cameron’s liberal approach to Conservatism. He thinks Cameron is too easily distracted by fringe issues which only the metropolitan elite care about, such as gay marriage. ‘He believes Cameron is unwilling to focus on the issues that matter, like cutting taxes and sorting out immigration, and therefore will not be able to deliver a clear Tory majority next time. A lot of the donors agree with Ashcroft that there is no strategic vision. What does Cameron’s Government stand for? Cameron seems oblivious to our concerns so it’s no wonder Ashcroft has stopped giving financial support. In fact he stopped writing cheques before the last election.’ In another blow to Mr Cameron, his local Chipping Norton party chairman, Cicely Maunder, quit her post and tore up her party membership over his promotion of gay marriage. 'Distracting influence': Lord Ashcroft was ignored when he warned that the appointment of Australian-born Lynton Crosby (pictured) as the PM's election guru would be a 'mistake' Lord Ashcroft has urged the party to . drop issues such as gay marriage, and focus instead on wooing the . ‘suspicious strivers’ – voters who would naturally be Conservative but . feel the party has been taken over by those out of touch with their . concerns. And last year the . businessman was ignored when he warned that the appointment of . Australian-born Lynton Crosby as Mr Cameron’s election guru would be a . ‘mistake’. Straight-talking Mr Crosby, who is credited with helping Boris Johnson secure a second term as London Mayor, would prove to be a ‘distracting influence’, Lord Ashcroft said. Lord Ashcroft’s largesse has helped the party secure a series of marginal seats by master-minding their strategy and providing support to candidates. A source close to the billionaire businessman said: ‘He feels he has done his bit.’ However, he is still eager to provide support for individual candidates whose values he admires and will continue with his polling work and philanthropy. Under Mr Cameron’s leadership of the party, Lord Ashcroft donated £4million between 2006 and 2009, becoming the party’s biggest donor. In total he has given more than £10million. The Tory leadership has played down his withdrawal of funding, saying that he had not donated for the last few years. But Michael Dugher, Labour’s vice chairman, said his withdrawal of financial support was ‘a damning vote of no confidence’ in the Prime Minister. It comes as the chairman of Mr Cameron’s local party executive committee has quit in protest at the Government’s promotion of same sex marriage. 'Unwilling to focus on issues that matter': A source said that Lord Ashcroft thinks the PM is 'too easily distracted by fringe issues 'which only the metropolitan elite care about, such as gay marriage' Yesterday Mrs Maunder, 64, said: ‘I left . after 34 years because of David Cameron’s support for gay marriage. I . have no choice but to feel strongly about it as a Christian believer. Other members walked out too. I’ve had a lot of support.’ She added: ‘ I renewed my party subscription a week before I resigned and received my membership card but I’ve now binned it. I’m a lifelong Conservative like my family before me. I’ve served the party half my life. I’ll be a non-voter now. It’s very sad. ‘I haven’t had a chance to talk to Mr Cameron about it but maybe I’ll see him shopping.’ She added: ‘I’m not anti-gay people at all. I fully agree with civil partnership rights. But most gay people will tell you that’s all they wanted and they don’t want gay marriage.’ A Tory source pointed out that Mrs Maunder was one of 22 branch chairs in the local association.","Businessman Lord Ashcroft has given the Tories £10million in support .

"A toddler was nearly blinded after a pet hawk ripped his face with its  talons as he played in a park. Two-year-old Alfie Hall was in a playground with relatives when a Harris hawk named Bonnie swooped on to his head. Her razor-sharp talons cut his cheek,  narrowly missing his eye, and severed part of his left ear. Alfie’s mother Elysia, 23, said  doctors had to glue the ear back together. Terrible: Covered in blood with scratches and tears all over his face, brave Alfie Hall just after being attacked by a hawk as he played . Recovery: Still bearing the scars of the attack, Alfie is beginning to get over the attack . She said: ‘There was blood everywhere. The bird ripped several chunks out of his head, including a big gash . right next to his eye which needed stitches. 'The doctors told us he was . lucky not to lose his sight. ‘Alfie was totally shocked, his eye was swollen and I could see his ear was badly injured too. ‘We called an ambulance and they whisked Alfie off to the hospital, where he was given anaesthetic and kept in overnight.’ Miss Hall, from Church Crookham, . Hampshire, said Bonnie ignored the calls of her teenage owner and . ‘dive-bombed’ Alfie as he stood in the park in a council estate in . Farnborough. But the hawk’s owner, Scott Brewer, . 18,  yesterday denied the bird had deliberately attacked Alfie and . insisted she was safe around children. He said: ‘If she had meant to attack . him, the extent of his injuries would have been a lot worse. 'Their . talons lock into place, so she could have ripped his face off if she . meant to.’ Mr Brewer said he had twice warned a . group of children, including Alfie, not to bother Bonnie while she was . feeding minutes before the incident. ‘She can get a bit grumpy and try and nip you, but she would never draw blood,’ he said. He believes the two-year-old hawk caught the toddler with her talons accidentally after mistaking his head for a landing post. On the defensive: Owner Scott Brewer with Bonnie the hawk . Attacker: A teenager lost control of his Harris Hawk (pictured in the wild), which then went for the toddler's face and ears . Innocent: Alfie and mum Elysia were at this Hampshire play area when the devastating attack happened . He said: ‘He was the same height as . the railings where she normally sits. 'She does land on people’s heads . sometimes. It’s something birds do because it’s the highest point.’ Bonnie, who has a wingspan of 3.5ft and can fly at 45mph, has been raised from 16 weeks old by Mr Brewer. Named after 19th-century  US naturalist Edward Harris, the hawks can have a  wingspan of up to 5ft, with the females about a third larger than males. They are nicknamed the wolves of the sky because they hunt in ‘packs’ They eat rabbits, rats and birds but are themselves hunted by great horned owls . The oldest recorded life  span of a wild Harris hawk is 12 years and seven months. But this can increase to 25 years in captivity. Until the incident in September, he . exercised her for an hour every day at the park. He added: ‘Kids would . come out every day when I was in the park with her and I’d have 30 . children around me. 'I’ve had really young children, even babies, stroke . her. She’s never attacked anyone before.’ Mr Brewer, who is unemployed but . dreams of opening a sanctuary for birds of prey, has had an obsession . with birds all his life. His family have three European eagle owls, a . barn owl and another Harris hawk, which they keep in aviaries in their . large garden. Mr Brewer was arrested for assault two days after the incident but released without charge. He has been banned from flying Bonnie . on council land, so now takes her to private woodland where she is free . to hunt for rabbits and pheasants. An RSPCA spokesman said there was no law governing where pet birds of prey can be flown. He added: ‘Any wild animal kept as a . pet is a challenge and owners have a responsibility to ensure they can . provide for their needs. 'Hawks are wild animals and not domesticated. They have a very specific diet of raw meat and need to be given lots of space.’","Alfie Hall was with his mother Elysia when the Harris Hawk swooped and tore at his face .

"Arsenal have again returned robust financial results in their latest published figures, with turnover increased to £148.5million and an overall profit before tax of £11.1m. The Gunners, who sit third in the Barclays Premier League, have seen their off-field revenue streams based around the 60,000-seater Emirates Stadium continue to improve over the six months ended November 30 2014, which has in turn released more funds for record player purchases of £93.7m including the likes of summer acquisitions of Calum Chambers, Mathieu Debuchy, David Ospina, Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck. The increase in turnover, up some £12.6m from the same period in 2013, was part grown by the club's new kit partnership with Puma, while cash reserves now stand at £138.8m, up from £120.6m. Arsenal's majority shareholder Stan Kroenke (centre) watches Arsenal at the Emirates . Things weren't going so well on the pitch on Wednesday night however, as Arsenal lost to Monaco . Former Tottenham striker Dimitar Berbatov netted against the Gunners in a 3-1 defeat by the Ligue 1 side . Arsenal, whose only long-term debt is against low-interest fixed-rate bond repayments for their stadium, expect to be 'fully compliant with all of the requirements of both the Premier League and UEFA financial regulatory regimes'. Chairman Sir Chips Keswick said: 'Our commitment to investment in the squad was evidenced by a record level of expenditure on players joining the club. 'Crucially, this investment remains at a level which is consistent with our principle of affordability and which is financially sustainable in accordance with the applicable regulatory regimes. Arsenal won their first major silverware for nine years during that period when they lifted the FA Cup . Arsenal brought in Alexis Sanchez last summer for £30million from Barcelona . 'On the field, the team has produced some strong results and the squad is looking fit and better balanced. 'However, we need to find our best form on a more consistent basis as we approach, what I hope will be, an exciting end to the season.' On Wednesday night, Arsenal saw their hopes of progress through to the quarter-finals of the Champions League left in doubt following an unexpected 3-1 home defeat by Monaco. It is understood manager Arsene Wenger will again be fully backed by the board as he looks to further strengthen the squad in the summer transfer window to mount a sustained challenge for honours.","Arsenal release financial figures for six months ending November 30 .

"Victor White III died in March while handcuffed in the back of a deputy's car at the sheriff's station in New Iberia, Louisiana . A 22-year-old African-American shot himself in the chest when his hands were cuffed behind his back, a coroner has ruled. Victor White III died in March while restrained in the back of a deputy's car at the sheriff's station in New Iberia, Louisiana. Louisiana State Police initially reported that Mr White shot himself in the back when his hands were cuffed behind him. But this contradicts the final report of the Iberia Parish coroner, released six months later, which states that Mr White was shot in the chest, not the back. He and a friend, Isaiah Lewis, 24, were searched by police at around 11.30pm on March 2. After officers found cocaine and marijuana, Mr White was transported to the patrol centre to be questioned by narcotics detectives. He died of a gun shot wound after a bullet entered his right chest, perforated his left lung and heart and then exited under his left armpit, the coroner's report states. Mr White was left-handed, according to family members. A forensic pathologists found gunshot residue in the wound and cuts were seen on Mr White's face. Dr Carl Ditch ruled that White shot himself, and declared his death a suicide on Monday. In a statement, he said: 'Although the decedent was handcuffed at the time with his hands to his back, due to his body habitus (type), the pathologist and investigators agree that he would have been able to manipulate the weapon to the point where the contact wound was found.' Dr. Maranda Kles, a forensic expert with UL Lafayette reviewed the autopsy and coroner's statement. Louisiana State Police initially reported that Mr White shot himself in the back, but a coroner's report states he was shot in the chest and declared that it was a suicide . She explained the bullet entered on the right lateral or side part of the chest and exited on the left. When asked, how it might have been possible for White to manoeuvre and retrieve the gun, she said: 'If there was some give in those handcuffs that allowed for movement in the arms over to the side, movement of the hands it could have been possible. 'The further the gun is away from the body, the larger the spread of that pattern. If you have no stippling, it typically means you have a very close or contact wound which means the gun was pressed against the skin or in very, very close proximity, millimeters from the skin.' Mr White's father, a Baptist minister and former substance abuse counselor, has expressed anger at the verdict, which he believes is physically impossible. Dr Carl Ditch ruled that White shot himself and said: 'Although the decedent was handcuffed at the time, the pathologist and investigators agree that he would have been able to manipulate the weapon' Reverend Victor White II, 53, said: 'You can't make me understand how my son took his left hand, when he was handcuffed behind the back, and shot himself. I don't believe a thing they're saying at this point.' His son had begun saving for an apartment with his long-time girlfriend and their infant daughter before he died on either March 2 or March 3. Family members say he had no history of depression and was trying to decide whether to go to community college or apply for a more job  on one of the  Gulf of Mexico oil rigs. A justice for Victor defence fund started by his parents has raised $3,700.","Victor White III, 22, died while handcuffed in a deputy's car in Louisiana .

"A retired engineer and his wife have been savagely beaten in their home by intruders five years after moving to Australia. Ken Ainscough, 76, was hit on the head, resulting in bleeding on the brain, while his wife Rosalind, 71, is being treated for a fractured skull, and both are now receiving round-the-clock medical care. Two men are believed to have smashed their way into the couple's two-storey home in a wealthy suburb of Adelaide. The couple have lived in the house for the last five years after moving there from Blackburn, Lancashire, to be closer to their daughter, Lisa. Attacked: Ken Ainscough, 76, and his wife Rosalind, 71, who moved to Adelaide, pictured above, five years ago, were attacked in their home by two hooded burglars . She said: ‘They were due to receive Australian citizenship soon, but they’ve been left traumatised by this. ‘It . is just absolutely terrible. There’s no way you should attack old . people,’ she told Channel 10 news as she stood outside the couple’s . house. ‘They were just in their own home. ‘My . father tried to hold the door shut to stop them coming at them because . he saw them. They just barged in and attacked them over the head. ‘They are old people and they did not need to hit them over the head like that. They could have just pushed them to the side.’ She said that despite their injuries, her parents remembered details of the attack vividly. Her mother, she said, was ‘feeling terrible this morning – worse than yesterday. 'She is just sick and suffering from nausea and she can’t get out of bed as she can’t walk.’ A fresh start: The couple sold their multi-million pound scuba diving business in Blackburn, Lancashire, pictured, to start a new life in Australia . Police Inspector Tim Scammell of . Adelaide police said one of the men was armed with a long knife while . the other was believed to have had a sawn-off shotgun. The . couple were believed to be wealthy, Mr Ainscough selling his . multi-million pound scuba diving equipment business in Blackburn before . he and his wife emigrated to Australia. They . purchased their home in the district of Burnside in 2004 and, said . their daughter Lisa, looked forward to a happy retirement. But their dreams were smashed when their dog began to bark at 12.30am, warning that intruders had got in. Lisa . said her father tried to hold the door of their bedroom closed, but the . men forced it open and he was hit over the head, falling to the ground. When . his wife tried to help him, she was also attacked. They managed to . raise the alarm and were rushed to the Royal Adelaide Hospital for . emergency treatment. Inspector Scammell described the attack as a ‘particularly violent and senseless act’, especially as the assailants, believed to be in their 20s, escaped with only a small amount of money.’ It comes as a former air ambulance boss has been killed in a road crash in Australia - just weeks after emigrating Down Under. Harold Chapman was former chairman of the Cornwall Air Ambulance Trust. His wife Pamela, who was also a trustee of the charity, was seriously injured in the accident.

While contestants of the BBC television show failed to impress in one of the episodes with their confectionery brand, which was criticized for having too many product offerings, little Mollie Price has concentrated on British sweets and American candy. She is now celebrating the launch of her third shop called 'Mollie's' in the Welsh market town of Welshpool. Sweet success: Mollie, aged six, pictured in one of her three confectionery shops . In recognition of her business achievements she has been declared one of the youngest entrepreneurs in the UK. With the help of her mother Becky, she recently opened her third store in Shrewsbury’s Pride Hill Shopping Centre to add to two existing branches on Welshpool High Street and in Newtown’s Bear Lanes Shopping Centre. Her mother says Mollie - who organises and selects all of the stock for each of the branches - is now determined to expand her empire. Becky said: 'It might sound crazy but . believe Mollie is the real brains behind the operation. It was Mollie’s . idea to set up the shop. She used to love going to pic n mix places and saw there was a gap in the market for it.' All of the stores are organised and stocked by Mollie . Good work ethic: According to mother Becky (right) Mollie works in one of the stores every Saturday . 'She works in one of the stores on Saturday and wakes up at 5am every Sunday ready to go to our wholesale suppliers in Birmingham to restock. She asks her friends to test the sweets to decide which ones are good. 'She has plans to expand the business and we might be setting up a new store. She’s definitely leaning towards a career in business and she has plans to take over the sweet shops when she’s older. It’s been a great learning experience for her.' Honouring her favourite film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Mollie has included a plethora of Wonka products. And at the entrance to the shops are two large tin soldiers standing . guard named after her two brothers Alfie . and George. Becky adds: 'If she doesn’t think an idea will work she will say so. By listening to Mollie we are making sure our shops appeal to all ages.

"The American news anchor who sensationally quit her job at state-funded Russia Today on air earlier this month has spoken out for the first time about her bold decision and how the channel’s coverage of President Putin sending troops into Ukraine was the final straw for her. After working out of RT's Washington, DC bureau, for two and a half years, Connecticut-born Liz Wahl said she knew she had to quit. ‘I’d looked the other way as the network smeared America for the sake of making the Kremlin look better by comparison, while it sugarcoated atrocities by one brutal dictator after another,’ she told Politicio Magazine. Scroll down for video . Connecticut-born Liz Wahl who sensationally quit her job at state-funded Russia Today on air earlier this month has spoken out for the first time about her bold decision and how the channel's coverage of events in Ukraine that was the final straw for her . When Russia invaded Ukraine, she said she finally came to see just how dangerous a propaganda tool the network was and so she resigned live on TV as a form of protest. In closing statements during her 5 p.m. broadcast on March 5, Wahl said: ‘I cannot be part of a network funded by the Russian government that whitewashes the actions of Putin.’ ‘I am proud to be an American and believe in disseminating the truth. And that is why, after this newscast, I am resigning.’ Afterwards as Wahl got up from the anchor chair and started to gather her belongings, she said her heart was racing as she was told her Russian news director wanted to see her in his office. Despite misgivings about joining a network funded by the Russian government, Wahl joined Russia Today in September 2011 after it was pitched to her as a channel that would take on the 'stories the mainstream media ignores' ‘He asked me why I did it, as though I had some reason other than the one I had just announced on live TV. I explained that it really was because of the propaganda RT was pushing about Ukraine,’ she said. Wahl then left the building and is currently searching for work opportunities with media organizations more dedicated to reporting the truth. She had joined Russia Today in September 2011 despite misgivings about working for a news network funded by the Russian government, after she was told she would be allowed to take on ‘stories the mainstream media ignores’. Wahl said she was given no indication that the news would be influenced by Russian politics, but she found it strange that almost all the on-air presenters were American, while her news director was Russian. No sooner had she started, than colleagues warned her that she would need to let go of any preconceived notions and her journalistic principles. Wahl has accused the state-funded Russia Today of deliberately smearing America in order to make the Kremlin - and Putin - look good . During her first week in the job the Occupy Wall Street movement began in New York City’s Zuccotti Park and her Russian news director announced that it was going to be their top story. The network’s coverage deliberately sought to portray America as a country in the midst of a popular uprising, she said and they ‘continued to suck it dry’ even after the numbers of protesters had dwindled. At the same time, she noted that protests in Moscow about alleged election fraud were all but ignored by the network. In her resignation, Wahl spoke about how personal the developments in the Ukraine were to her. Wahl's . grandparents had emigrated to the United States from Hungary during . that country's revolution in 1956 because of the threat of Soviet . forces. In the wake of her on-air resignation, Wahl appeared on The Colbert Report with Stephen Colbert . In an interview with the Daily Beast, Wahl said the Kremlin's influence over RT was not overt but 'in order to succeed there you don't question'. She said: 'In a way you kind of suppress any concerns that you have and play the game.' 'It actually makes . me feel sick that I worked there. It’s not a sound news organization, . not when your agenda is making America look bad,' she said. In the wake of Wahl's resignation, the network responded with a statement posted on their website. 'When . a journalist disagrees with the editorial position of his or her . organization, the usual course of action is to address those grievances . with the editor, and, if they cannot be resolved, to quit like a . professional. 'But when someone makes a big public show of a personal . decision, it is nothing more than a self-promotional stunt. We wish Liz . the best of luck on her chosen path,' the statement read.","Anchor Liz Wahl quit her job on live TV earlier this month to protest Russian President Vladimir Putin's incursion on Ukraine .

Simone, 20, is now signed to Models 1 and will grace the August cover of plus size fashion magazine, SLiNK. She is also now the face and body of new luxury denim line . Beauty in Curves. Scroll down for video . Simone Charles' winning Instagram picture was 'great, and in person she had star quality too' The competition required wannabe models to enter via uploading Instagram 'selfies' online and became the largest of it's kind, eclipsing 'straight' social media modelling comps as more than 5,000 girls size 12plus entered their pics. At 5ft 10inches tall Simone she has a gorgeous hourglass figure (bust 44 waist 36 hips 43) and her bikini-clad selfie got the judge's attention immediately. 'This is an amazing opportunity for normal people to enter the modelling industry,' said Simone. 'I am celebrating my incredible win with my family. Everyone's really excited and appreciates what a big deal it is for me. 'I've done a little bit of amateur modelling in the . past  for small scale fashion designers, and won a plus size modelling contest, Miss Curvaceous, in 2012.' But her Models 1 win is her biggest break yet and Simone is preparing herself for what's to come. 'I have a few model friends who help me . with questions I have about the industry and what to expect. Everyone's . really supportive, and they remind me to not forget what I've come from. 'My dream is to be the face of clothing brand with a high reputation which is respected worldwide. Someone like Gucci or Prada.' Simone is currently at university studying Psychology, the career she was planning before modelling came in to her life. 'It's something I enjoy - being a confident woman. I would like to be inspiration, someone people look up to. 'When . I was growing up, social media wasn't as widespread, we didn't have as . much access to bold, confident women who could inspire us to showcase . our bodies and talents. Now you can follow curvy models on Instagram and . feel inspired. Simone stands 5ft 10inches tall and has a perfect hourglass figure (bust 44 waist 36 hips 43) 'When I was younger all I had was my school friends to compare myself to, and many of them are a lot smaller than me and that made me feel insecure. 'I admire plus size models such as Denise Bidot. 'Coco Rocha is also inspiring, and Tyra Banks in terms of her fierceness and ambition - she's so bold and sure of herself.' 'I'd like to be the woman I wish was around when I was younger. One who works with what she's got. She's curvaceous and not shy about it. I want to be like that for girls who don't have that. I'd love to be a role model.' Simone is 'always on Instagram': 'I spend three hours a day scrolling through it. That's how I came accross the Models 1 contest. I follow them and saw they posted pictures about their Instagram model search so I applied. 'I used a picture taken while I was on holiday, I had a bit of a glow. It already had about 130 likes before I submitted it and I knew it was one of me best angles - I know how to work with that.' Simone poses up with four of the finalists and issues of SLiNK mag . 'When I was younger all I had was my school friends to compare myself to, and many of them are a lot smaller' Out of a record breaking 5,600 entries on Instagram, a panel of judges from Models 1, SLiNK Magazine and denim brand Beauty In Curves chose Simone Charles as the winner of this highly coveted contract.

Baum, Editor of SLiNK says: 'Having interviewed the finalists I was . really impressed and touched by their passion to create more diversity . within fashion and their understanding of the complexity of body image . amongst women. Their personal struggles were inspiring.' Alice . Dogruyol, Founder of Beauty in Curves says: 'When I created BC Jeans I . had a body just like Simone's in mind, a beautifully curvy hourglass . figure. I am thrilled to have found such a gorgeous woman and can't wait . to shoot her wearing BC Jeans. The fashion and media industries have . been dominated by one ideal for so long and it is time for more diverse . body shapes to be admired.

'I can snack on cheese all day, a couple of blocks is no problem, then for dinner I'll either eat pizzas or make Mexican food.

"Twitter has refused to close the accounts of London rioters who used the service to spread unrest and insisted that Tweets must 'continue to flow'. The US-based company said that 'freedom of expression' was essential and that information would be 'kept flowing'. Social networks have faced criticism for allowing rioters and looters to incite violence and public disorder across the country since riots began last Saturday in Tottenham. Twitter and BlackBerry Messenger were used by rioters and police have signaled that they will trawl people's accounts to find offenders. Targeted: Government spooks will track to the riot ringleaders' mobile phones to hunt down those responsible for the organising the violence . But Twitter refused to take their own . action against offenders. A spokesman told the Telegraph that a blog . post on the issue earlier this year was still relevant. Eight people in Cheshire had been arrested on suspicion of encouraging rioting via social media. A 20-year-old man from Northwich has been charged with intentionally encouraging the commissioning of an offence and is due to appear before magistrates. A 13-year-old boy from Warrington was released on police bail pending further inquiries. Two 22-year-old men from Warrington, a 23-year-old man from Chester and a 24-year-old man from Runcorn continue to be questioned. Two other males, both from Warrington and aged 17 and 18, were released without charge. 'Our goal is to instantly connect . people everywhere to what is most meaningful to them. For this to . happen, freedom of expression is essential,' it says. 'Some tweets may facilitate positive . change in a repressed country, some make us laugh, some make us think, . some downright anger a vast majority of users. We don't always agree . with the things people choose to tweet, but we keep the information . flowing irrespective of any view we may have about the content.' The revalation came as . Government spies have been drafted in to track riot ringleaders who . have been using encrypted instant messages on their BlackBerry . smartphones to avoid detection. Experts at the GCHQ listening station . in Cheltenham have joined forces with Scotland Yard to hunt down . hundreds of criminals suspected of masterminding some of the worst . looting. They are tracking communications over the internet and mobile phones that organised the mass rioting. The . development came as calls grew for the service to be shut down after it . played a key role in helping mobilise looters involved in the riots . across London. Mike Butcher, a technology journalist and digital adviser to Boris Johnson, said it was 'unbelievable' that the BBM service had not been disabled. Looter: Pictures put on Twitter showed some of the rioters using shopping trolleys to carry away stolen items including TVs and mobile phones . Messages on the service, along with . posts on Twitter, helped spread the locations of riots like wildfire and . brought hordes of teenagers together to attack neighbourhoods . throughout the weekend. However, . there are difficulties intercepting the instant and virtually . untraceable messages sent via BlackBerry Messenger, known as BBM, to . private networks of one or more people. Unlike social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, messages sent through BBM cannot be traced back to the sender. They are also encrypted, adding to the handset’s popularity among security-conscious business chiefs and criminals alike. Mr . Butcher described the BBM service as 'text messaging with steroids', as . Blackberry itself denied reports it had planned to disable the . messenging service. Mr Butcher had tweeted last night: 'It is unbelievable that @UK_BlackBerry is not shutting down BBM right now.' He . told the BBC Today programme this morning: 'Mobile phones have become . weaponised in their capability of spreading information about where to . target next. Intercepted: GCHQ employs some of the most skilled experts in intercepting messages and they may be able to recover information from phones . 'There is . evidence that BBM is an encrypted, very secure, safe, fast, cheap, easy . way for disaffected urban youths to spread messages for their next . target. 'It's like text . messaging with steroids - you can send messages to hundreds of people . and once it's gone from your phone it cannot be traced back to you.' GCHQ was brought in to trace the messages after senior officials designated bringing rioters to justice a ‘national priority’. Home Office sources said ‘several hundred’ ringleaders had already been identified by police intelligence staff. ‘Many of these people are part of . organised criminal gangs,’ said an official. ‘We know who they are and . we can see who else they are talking to. We are using all the resources . at our disposal. This is a national priority.’ Asked . if GCHQ was involved, a Downing Street official added: ‘All the usual . sources are being used to make sure the police have the information they . need. The idea is to round these people up and publicise who they are. We want to arrest them or spook them into staying off the streets.’ GCHQ employs some of the world’s most skilled experts in intercepting and recovering electronic communications. Police technical experts may also be able to recover incriminating information from the mobile phones – even the BlackBerrys – of suspects. This could include a record of their messages as well as photographs and internet searches. It is also possible undercover agents may have been able to infiltrate message networks. Research in Motion, the firm behind the BlackBerry, said it would ‘engage with the authorities’. This brought threats from hackers against the company. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Stephen Kavanagh, of the Met, said: ‘A lot of people who are seeing these BlackBerry messages are forwarding them to the police.’ A BlackBerry spokesman suggested that the company may help police trace those responsible for stirring up violence. He said: ‘We feel for those impacted by the riots in London. We have engaged with the authorities to assist in any way we can.’","Police will trawl accounts to find offenders .

"An obese mother-of-two who lives on benefits says she needs more of taxpayers' money to overhaul her unhealthy lifestyle. Christina Briggs, 26, from Wigan, says she hates being 25 stone but she can't do anything about it because she can only afford junk food. Meanwhile, exercise is out of the question because she doesn't have the funds to join a gym. The single mother told Closer Magazine: 'It's not easy being overweight and on benefits. If I was well off, I'd be able to buy fresh food and afford a gym membership. Scroll down for video . Only food she can afford: Christina Briggs' cupboards are full of junk food because she says she can't afford to eat heathily . She insists she can't get a job to gain more money because she's needed at home to care for her children . 'I tried swimming but it cost £22 a month and it meant I had to cut back on my favourite pizza and Chinese takeaways.' Unemployed Christina gets £20,000 in benefits a year and lives in a council house with her two children by different fathers, Helena, 10, and Robert, two. She left school as a teenager after falling pregnant with her daughter following a one night stand. The family feast everyday on takeaways, chocolate and crisps as Christina says they can't afford low fat foods. As a result, the mother is currently a dress size 26. She has been warned by her GP that her health is in danger because of her size - medical complications relating to obesity include heart disease and diabetes. Christina is desperate not to leave her two children without a mother and doesn't want her size to take her to an early grave. But she insists 'it's not my fault – healthy food is too expensive'. Wants a cash incentive: The mother, pictured with her children Helena, 10, and Robert, two, says the government should give her money to lose weight and pay her for every pound she loses . Read Christina's full story in this week's Closer magazine, on sale now . She feels her only hope is for the government to give her more money so she can afford to buy fruit and vegetables and join a gym. She also believes she should be paid to lose weight as that would give her the motivation to fight the flab. She told the magazine: 'I need more benefits to eat healthily and exercise. It would be good if the government offered a cash incentive for me to lose weight. I'd like to get £1 for every pound I lose, or healthy food vouchers. 'If the price of healthy food was lowered that would help, too. I need help, but I need it from the government.' She added that she can't get a job to gain more money because she's needed at home to care for her children, especially as her daughter has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and issues with her kidneys. She explained: 'There's no way I could get a job. I don't feel bad about the taxpayer funding my life and my child's medical problems, because I don't treat myself or buy anything excessive. I just get enough money to live on - the taxpayers should help fund my diet.' Closer magazine is on sale now .","Christina Briggs, 26, from Wigan, says she hates her large size .

Andrew Whyte, 39, from Southsea, Portsmouth carries the Lego man in his pocket where ever he goes, just in case the perfect picture opportunity arises. He said: 'I started the project because I am a really compulsive photographer and I feel like I have to take pictures at the time. 'I am used to taking pictures but not showing them to people so by introducing the Lego character into a scene it takes a on a whole new meaning as I am telling the story of the character.'

"A full 318 days after the Obama administration's medical insurance overhaul website's glitch-prone launch, taxpayers visiting healthcare.gov for critical information are instead encountering 'Lorem ipsum' – Latin-language filler text used by graphic designers as a placeholder when they don't yet have meaningful information to publish. The nonsense words appear when users reach Web pages dedicated to 'why health coverage is important,' 'how to appeal a Marketplace decision,' 'health coverage for military veterans' and the unemployed, and 'who's eligible to use the Marketplace.' In all, MailOnline found 13 mission-critical pages on the site that provided no meaningful information – just 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet ...' Other affected areas of the site include 'reporting income and household size,' 'health coverage for immigrants,' what to do 'if you have Medicare,' 're-enrolling in the Marketplace' and 'Health coverage for incarcerated people.' And users looking to 'Renew or Change a Plan' are met with a trio of online mini-chapters consisting only of the words: 'Add bite content here.' Nearly a year after its troubled launch, some critical pages on the healthcare.gov website still spout gibberish text . The Illinois Obamacare exchange's website seems to have caught its own case of 'Lorem ipsum' flu from the Department of Health and Human Services . Key vote: Rep. Danny Davis explained to constituents why he voted for the Obamacare law by publishing a stretch of dummy text . The Weekly Standard first reported a few of the anomalies Friday morning. Shortly after MailOnline completed its search, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began pulling the pages down. Now users navigating to the previously unfinished pages are met with a message: 'Sorry, we can't find that page on HealthCare.gov.' We've recently reorganized our site, and that may explain it. It's also possible that you mistyped the address. Google's robust automatic cache recorded copies of the flawed pages, but by noontime those, to, began to disappear. The search giant's corporate headquarters did not respond to requests for comment. But a flustered official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, speaking on condition of anonymity, conceded that the resulting picture didn't look good. It's 'something that should never have been left hanging for this long,' said the official, who is not authorized to speak publicly. '[Our] tech teams scrambled mid-morning. What can I say?' More problems: As President Barack Obama golfs his way across Martha's Vineyard, he'll be dismayed to learn that Americans who can't understand Latin nonsense words still aren't getting critical information from his health insurance website . Infected: Back-end programming code includes the silly text too . Victims' Wrongs Caucus: A bipartisan congressional group is communicating gibberish . Asked what the consequences the agency could see for for leaving Americans in the dark for so long about basic elements of the Affordable Care Act's services, he said it would be handled quietly but did not classify it as a high priority. For centuries, typesetters and graphic designers have used Latin-style nonsense words like these to plan their pages long before writers have decided what to communicate. The beginning of the text dates back to at least 45 B.C., but the rest is completely meaningless: . Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sumenda potius quam expetenda. Ut optime, secundum naturam affectum esse possit. Quid iudicant sensus? Cum salvum esse flentes sui respondissent, rogavit essentne fusi hostes. Ita nemo beato beatior. Duo Reges: constructio interrete. Quo modo autem philosophus loquitur? Et si turpitudinem fugimus in statu et motu corporis, quid est cur pulchritudinem non sequamur? Sin tantum modo ad indicia veteris memoriae cognoscenda, curiosorum. Dici enim nihil potest verius. Sint ista Graecorum; In his igitur partibus duabus nihil erat, quod Zeno commutare gestiret. 'We'll fix it, sure. In our own time,' he told MailOnline. 'We're really focused on the back-end of the site right now, getting insurers paid and making sure collected premiums are being assigned to the correct accounts.' Temporarily inserting 'Lorem Ipsum' text – meaningless but standardized strings of Latin – into the Obamacare website appears to have been a common practice for code monkeys as well as art directors. One lengthy page of javascript language computer code, designed to implement the health insurance registration process, still includes at least 17 separate snippets of 'Lorem ipsum.' Some state-level Obamacare exchanges also suffer from the same problem. The Get Covered Illinois website includes a page – full of 'Lorem ipsum' – intended to help consumers choose their insurance plans. Congress, too, has its share of lazy Web coders who have left a trail of the placeholder words in their wake. Rep. Danny Davis, . an Illinois Democrat, provides his constituents with an online . explanation of the rationale behind his decision to vote in favor of the . Affordable Care Act. Its entire contents are 'Lorem ipsum' words. Another Democratic lawmaker, Rep. David Price of North Carolina, has published three paragraphs of the text in place of a press release. Staffers of Arizona Democratic Rep. Ed Pastor and California Republican Rep. John Campbell appear to have made the same error. The website of the Congressional Victims' Rights Caucus, a group founded by Texas Republican Rep. Ted Poe and California Democratic Rep. Jim Costa, includes a 2012 press release that consists of nothing but the dummy text. Military veterans, too, are stung by the nonsense copy on Healthcare.gov . Covering their tracks: HHS began pulling down its dummy text-filled pages after reporters starting sniffing . Another plagiarized graduate thesis in Congress? No, just nonsense text disguised as a press release . The Office of General Counsel (OGC) of the House of Representatives, too, features online press releases and one op-ed that are little more than 'Lorem ipsum. The OGC is the office that will soon file House Speaker John Boehner's landmark federal lawsuit against President Barack Obama, inspired by the White House's changes to the Obamacare law. And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Some savvy Web designers have devised ways to use dummy text without leaving a trail of breadcrumbs in case the fake words remain there longer than intended. Tricks include the use of online custom text generators which provide endless paragraphs of real-looking but nonsensical words based on limited dictionaries tailored to specific interests. One assembles text that reads like a page from a Samuel L. Jackson movie. The output from another reads like the stylings of the artist formerly known as Snoop Dogg. There's a text generator for hipster language like 'Vinyl flexitarian pour-over farm-to-table, street art meggings slow-carb put a bird on it scenester chambray shabby chic.' Yet another capitalizes on the popularity of pork bellies. 'Bacon ipsum dolor sit amet pork loin tenderloin short loin,' was the beginning of its output on Friday afternoon.","Graphic designers use Latin-like nonsense text to temporarily plan pages before writers finish writing .

"She is France's most famous dominatrix, has written several books on sexual submission, and now lives in a chateau in Normandy with a female submissive 31 years younger than her. But for 50 years of marriage Catherine Robbe-Grillet, now 83, submitted herself to the sexual slavery of her husband, Alain, who drew up a contract for her setting out rules for kinky torture sessions. Though she never signed the so-called Contract of Conjugal Prostitution, Catherine willingly participated in Alain's every fantasy, including being whipped, slapped, bitten, scratched, chained up and blindfolded. Catherine Robbe-Grillet (left) willingly submitted herself to sexual slavery at the hands of her husband Alain (right) who drew up a contract for her outlining the rules of their kinky bondage sessions . The contract has now been translated and printed in Vanity Fair, and lays bare exactly what Catherine's demanding husband expected of his bride, with the promise of 20,000 francs (£4,500) if she obeyed. According to the contract, which was drawn up in 1958, a year after the couple married in Paris, Catherine would have to present herself at a set time and place, dressed however Alain demanded, and willing to do whatever he asked of her. The sessions, which could last for a maximum of two hours, were to be purely for his benefit. Catherine was expected to be obedient and willing to please, but nothing more. Alain says he will allow her to take pleasure from whatever he is planning, but that all other emotions must be hidden except fear, pain and disgust, which she is allowed to show only for the briefest of moments. Alain makes it clear that the various 'postures' he wants her in 'will nearly always be humiliating', she will be 'relentlessly' slapped and bitten for as long as he likes, though she may beg for mercy if it is hurting her too much. Fame: Alain was a famous French film maker and novelist while Catherine also published books on sado-masochism under the pseudonym of Jeanne de Berg . Any marks left afterwards will be temporary, he says, and last only for a few hours. Catherine can also expect to be scratched 'preferably in the most sensitive areas' but can rest assured that her husband won't cause any 'conspicuous' bleeding. The couple remained married until 2008, when Alain passed away. Catherine now lives in Normandy with a female submissive 31 years her junior . Alain may also use chains to hold Catherine's body in various degrading positions, and while they may uncomfortable or painful he expects her to hold them for as long as he likes, though again she may beg for release. When she arrives and before she leaves Catherine must kneel in front of him to show his dominance, but otherwise she must 'remain exposed and open to him at all times' and ready to change position at the slightest command. Finally, after he is finished with her, Alain says his wife will be dismissed 'without further ado' and that she must leave the room without speaking. The erotic contract echoes the Mistress Contract, drawn up by an anonymous American couple 'She' and 'He', which laid out rules for an affair which started in 1981. She would, she wrote, perform ‘mistress services’ for him, becoming his ‘sexual property’ and providing ‘companionship’ unless she was ‘indisposed or travelling’. In return, like Alain and Catherine, She expected to be paid in return for becoming the sexual property of He. Unlike She and He however, Alain and Catherine remained happily married until 2008 when Alain, who was also a film director and author, died. During that time Catherine published several books on sado-masochism working under the pseudonym of Jeanne de Berg. After her husband's death, she became involved with a 51-year-old woman from South Africa and the pair moved to Normandy, where Catherine took on the role of the dominant partner. She still eagerly participates in sex session, and recently hosted a bizarre party in which four different scenarios were acted out involving a hotel, chambermaids a bellboy and several people playing hotel guests.","Alain and Catherine Robbe-Grillet married in 1957 in Paris .

"It is hard to know who our real friends are sometimes in the fast-paced modern world of virtual friends and virtual social networks. Now criminals are trying to blur the lines even further by posing as friends on the streets of Manchester so that they can take advantage of people who have been drinking to excess. Greater Manchester Police have warned that criminals are targeting inebriated people on nights out and convincing them that they are their friends before mugging them. The Manchester police have released CCTV footage of people falling victim to the so-called hugger-muggers as a result of excessive drinking.

"State hospital: Isabella Guzman, pictured, will now head to the states' mental hospital for evaluation and treatment after stabbing her mother to death last August . A Colorado teenager who was accused of stabbing her mother 151 times last summer will not be going to jail after having had her insanity plea accepted by the court. Isabella Yun-Mi Guzman, 19, is accused of killing her mother in their Aurora home in August 2013. Last December she pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity and was sent to a state mental hospital for an evaluation. At a court hearing on Thursday, a judge reviewed the results of that mental evaluation and ruled that Guzman is not guilty by reason of insanity. She has been sent to the Colorado Mental Health Institute of Pueblo. Judicial District Attorney George Brauchler said, 'Look, the job of the district attorney is to pursue justice. And at first blush, when you look at this case, you see a horrific and violent murder by a daughter towards her mother. I've never seen a person with that many stab wounds. She stabbed her over 150 times.  So you want that person to be held accountable. 'But our system is a system that is not just conviction-laden or prison-laden, but justice-bound, and you have to look at this component, which is mental health,' Brauchler stressed. Brauchler said the State Hospital had a longer than normal opportunity to review Guzman's mental health. 'They had an opportunity to administer and tweak the drugs that might affect her psychology,' he said. 'The end conclusion was that she suffers from a mental illness that kept her from being able to form the ability to know right from wrong -- both legally and morally.' During testimony, Dr. Richard Pounds said Guzman was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. 'There were obvious signs of hallucinating,' Pounds said. 'She was staring into space, having conversations with people who were not present, and she was laughing at herself.' When asked how long Guzman might be at the State Hospital, Brauchler said, 'For an indeterminate period of time.' No jail: Isabella Guzman will not go to prison, but will be sent to the State Hospital in Pueblo for treatment . 'It will be until these state doctors determine that she is no longer a risk or threat to herself or the community. It could be a year, two years. It could be the remainder of her life,' Brauchler added. 'These are tough decisions on their face,' Brauchler said, 'because you have someone who committed such a violent act of murder against a completely innocent and defenseless woman. Her mother was in the shower when she stabbed her 151 times. But, we're not in the business of just locking up everybody who has transgressed the law… We punish people who make decisions to do wrong when they knew better and could have done something differently.' Brauchler said that, in this particular case, he's convinced, based on the evidence he's seen, that Guzman did not know right from wrong. 'I was convinced of it,' he said. 'And in the interest of justice I had to take these steps.' It was originally reported that Guzman had stabbed her mom, 47-year-old Yun Mi Hoy, 79 times in the face and neck, but court testimony indicated she actually stabbed her mother 151 times in total, including 35 times in the face and 51 times in the neck. She then finished her off by beating her with a baseball bat. What lurks beneath: Guzman appears like any normal teenager in this picture from her Facebook profile . How could she? In the horrifying attack, Guzman stabbed her mother in the face, neck, arms and torso on Aug. 28, 2013. She also beat her with a baseball bat . According to the affidavit, Isabella had grown 'more threatening and disrespectful' towards her mother leading up to her death. It's still unclear what exactly her mother was worried about, but neighbors had called the police in the past when they saw men jumping over a fence into the family's backyard. Those men were later discovered to be Isabella's boyfriends paying her a visit. The day before her mother was killed, Isabella spit on her mother and sent her an email threatening: 'You will pay.' Earlier on the day of the attack, Aurora police officers came to their house on a report of a family dispute. Officers said they found no hostility or rage at the house. Hidden rage: Aurora police officers came to their house on a report of a family dispute. Officers said they found no hostility or rage at the house . They warned Guzman, who was 18 at the time, that her mother could kick her out of the house for her behavior. It seemed to calm Guzman down and she stayed in her room most of the day, her stepfather, Ryan Hoy, said. Mrs Hoy had grown so scared of her daughter, that she called on her ex-husband, Isabella's father Robert Guzman, to speak to the teenager. Just three hours before Mrs Hoy way murdered, Robert Guzman paid a visit to the house his daughter lived in with his ex-wife and her new husband, Ryan Hoy. As they sat in the backyard, he explained the importance of respecting your elders, and truly believed he had gotten through to her. 'In the conversation, I thought that I made progress,' Mr Guzman said, 'but obviously it didn't do nothing, because hours later, this thing happened.' Then at 10:11 p.m., the stepfather called 911 to report that the teen was beating his wife in a locked bathroom. Mrs Hoy's husband Ryan Hoy was home when the fight broke out. He says his wife had just returned from work around 9:30pm when she went upstairs to take a shower. Mr Hoy was eating when he heard a thumping sound upstairs and his wife calling his name. He ran to the upstairs bathroom, but Isabella quickly shut and locked the door and he noticed blood streaming under the door. Insane: Guzman had a contentious relationship with her mother, Yun-Mi Hoy, who had been concerned enough with the teen's threatening behavior to call police . Not guilty: A judge declared Isabella insane and she has been sent to a state mental hospital for evaluation . Soon after, Isabella emerged from the bathroom and walked out holding the knife, staring straight forward as she passed her stepfather and went downstairs. Mr Hoy tried to revive his wife but knew she was already dead by the look in her eyes. When police arrived they officially pronounced Mrs Hoy dead. Aurora police officer Frank Fania described the scene as 'pretty gruesome'. Pretty gruesome: Police arrived and found Mrs Hoy already dead, having suffered 78 stab wounds to the neck and face . Isabella had since left the scene of the crime, and wasn't tracked down until noon the next day. After the killing, police say Guzman fled the home. She went to a woman's restroom at a nearby H Mart, washed her hair in the sink and changed her clothes. They say she told employees that she had been raped in Denver and asked them not to call police, because they would send her back home and she was in fear of her father. When police tracked Guzman down the next day, she told them they had the wrong person. She said she was Samantha Gonzales from Cincinnati, Ohio. Police held up her ID card, but the teen said, 'It looks like me, but it's not.' Eventually police discovered Isabella leaving the parking garage. Witnesses watched as three police officers pulled out guns and ordered the teen to the ground, and took her into custody. Shocked: Isabella's father Robert Guzman had spoken with his daughter just three hours before the killing, on behalf of his fearful ex-wife .","Mother, Yun Mi Hoy was discovered stabbed 151 times in the face and neck .

"A 17-year-old boy has been sentenced to 23 years behind bars for fatally shooting a retired police dog during a burglary. Ivins Rosier was convicted in May for breaking into the Florida home of a trooper and shooting the officer's five-year-old German Shepherd two years ago. Drake, a former drug-sniffing dog, was euthanized five days later. Rosier, who was 16 at the time of the incident but tried as an adult, was sentenced on Friday on charges of animal cruelty, armed burglary and shooting into an occupied building. Convicted: Ivins Rosier, 17 (pictured left and right) was tried as an adult in the November 2012 burglary and shooting . Victim: Retired police dog Drake, a five-year-old German Shepherd, died five days after being shot several times in November 2012 . Palm Beach Post reported Circuit Judge Robin Rosenberg said she handed Rosier a tough sentence as she was bound by sentencing guidelines. According to police, Rosier was one of three teens who broke into Florida Highway Patrol Trooper Robert Boody's home on November 18, 2012. Rosier, who had a history of run-ins with the police, is the first to be tried, according to Palm Beach Post. Sun Sentinel reported . that Rosier confessed to police he was the one who shot the dog. During the two-day trial, patrol . officer Boody cried as he told the court about returning home from work . to find Drake, who he adopted in 2010, wounded. Drake suffered broken limbs, bullet wounds in his head and jaw, . massive blood loss and lethal damage to his esophagus. 'He was in obvious pain,' Boody said, according to Sun Sentinel. Convicted: Ivins Rosier, 17, pictured at the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office courtroom in West Palm Beach on November 30, 2012, after being accused of breaking into a Florida trooper's home and shooting his police dog .

'If . you shoot that dog and he dies, that's murder of a law enforcement . officer,' DiMola pressed Rosier in the interrogation video. Meanwhile, Rosier's . attorneys, Jack Fleishman and Rachel Preefer, asked Judge Rosenberg to . sentence the teen as a juvenile with a six-year prison terms. However she said she didn't feel that was appropriate after the court heard Rosier had faced previous juvenile charges for grand . theft, battery, lewd and lascivious molestation and false imprisonment. During . the November 2012 shooting, he was wearing an ankle monitor for a . previous burglary charge which officers used to link him to the crime scene. Rosier told Rosenberg he was misunderstood and blamed his problems on drug and alcohol addiction. 'The . vicious ruthless person that I’ve been portrayed to be, that’s not who I . am, that’s not who I’ll ever be,' Rosier said.","Ivins Rosier was tried as an adult in the November 2012 attack .

"A brain-dead two-year-old Brooklyn girl's organs will not be donated after a family dispute kept her on life support. A New York Organ Donor Network spokeswoman tells The New York Times that organ and tissue donation 'can only occur when there is agreement amongst family members'. The parents of Thaiya Spruill-Smith were in disagreement over whether to donate her organs after the toddler was declared brain dead on Friday. Police say her stepfather violently shook her, resulting in injuries that proved fatal. Tragic: Thaiya Spruill-Smith, two, was taken off life support on Saturday after suffering a brain hemorrhage. Her organs will not be donated following a family dispute, the New York Organ Donor Network has confirmed . David Adams has so far been charged with assault, but prosecutors say the charges will be upgraded. On Monday, a judge ordered Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center to keep the child on life support for at least another day to keep her organs alive until the girl's parents resolved their dispute. Her mother, Teoka Spruill, 24, wanted her organs donated; the father, Terrell Smith, 26, objected. 'She was born with that, she's going to be buried with that, her body, her eyes - it's what makes her her,' Smith told the New York Times from Thaiya's hospital bed in Brookdale Hospital, New York. 'My daughter was born with that, and she's going to lie down with the same thing.' Speaking separately, Spruill told the paper: 'I just think it would be a blessing for someone else's family.' There will be an autopsy on Thaiya's body as her death is the subject of a criminal investigation. Her death certificate will state Friday as her date of death, regardless. The parental dispute is reportedly the latest in a series spanning Thaiya's lifetime, as Smith claims he made repeated attempts to save her from Adams, who he claims was abusive. The two-year-old was rushed to Brookdale Hospital in Brooklyn, New York, shortly before 7am on Thursday after her  mother noticed she was struggling to breathe. Despite numerous operations, doctors concluded Thaiya's injuries were too severe to overcome and she was taken off life support. It has since emerged that Thaiya may have been the victim of months of abuse at the hands of her stepfather that was investigated by New York City social services. Relatives have made emotional tributes to the 'smart' and 'sweet' girl as her mother's husband David Adams, 25, appeared in court charged with inflicting the fatal wounds. Anger: Her father Terrell Smith says she was being systematically abused by her mother's new husband . 'Thai, she was like the sweetest little girl ever, like you wouldn't have problems with her ever,' Shayne Smith, Thaiya's uncle, told Time Warner Cable. 'She was very smart - very, very smart.' According to court documents, Adams admitted to shaking Thaiya when questioned. And police sources say there are records of a similar shaking incident in the household last month. Judge Michael Gerstein plans to upgrade Adams' charge from assault to attempted murder once Thaiya's autopsy has been carried out, the New York Daily News reported. Adams, who married Thaiya's mother in March, wept before prosecutors in court as they told him the two-year-old had died. 'He was shocked. He was very, very upset,' defense attorney Joseph Sieger told the New York Post. Smith said social services took custody of the little girl for a week while they investigated Adams for abuse. She was returned and the case was dropped, he said. The ACS has refused to confirm or deny Smith's claims due to confidentiality restrictions. Paramedics were called to the home in the Brownsville area of Brooklyn shortly before 7am on Thursday. According to Smith, she had already had the injuries for days. Spruill, Thaiya's mother, is the half-sister of Tiona Rodriguez, who was caught carrying her dead baby son in a plastic bag in Victoria's Secret last year, then aged 17.","Thaiya Spruill-Smith, 2, died on Friday after 'being violently shaken by father on Wednesday'

"More than 500 Roma people, including more than 70 children, have been evicted from a makeshift camp in Paris. Police stormed the camp in the suburb of Saint-Ouen this morning, forcing out 250 people. Another 300 who were warned of the evacuation left last night. It comes amid a fierce crackdown on gipsy sites by French police, and polls which say more than four-fifths of French people want the camps destroyed. Evacuated: Two Roma children walk through a camp in northern Paris which has been evacuated by police . Crackdown: The camp had more than 500 people living in it. More than half left before this morning's action . Workers at the camp from the state-owned railway firm SNCF, which complained the site was on their land . Bleak: The camp was by the side of train tracks leading to Paris' main station, the Gare du Nord . The authorities moved in after France's state-owned railway company SNCF complained about the state of makeshift shacks by train tracks on their property. Dilapidated huts built out of fragments of doors and wooden panels were destroyed, leaving litter, gas canisters and childrens' buggies on the wasteland. Inhabitants were offered temporary housing, although none accepted, police claimed. The evacuation passed without incident this morning, the police statement added. Many Roma people in France live on vacant lots, lacking running water or electricity. Evacuated: A police officer at the Roma camp in the suburbs of Paris. It was evacuated peacefully today . Dismal: The French interior minister Manuel Valls called the country's Roma camps 'slums' but sparked outrage by saying gipsy communities should leave France and return to places in eastern Europe . Abandoned: A child's buggy and other household items - including a panther ornament - in the Paris camp . Forlorn: The camp is now abandoned and its inhabitants have moved on, leaving possessions in their wake . There are an estimated 20,000 in France, a population that remains stable despite attempts by both Socialist and conservative governments to return them to their homelands. Half that number were forced out of informal settlements in the first half of 2013, according to a report by Amnesty International, which says forced evictions should be banned. France has launched an especially fierce crackdown on Roma camps in recent months. The country's biggest site in Lille, which numbered 800 people, was emptied completely in September. French Interior Minister Manuel Valls has said the Roma deserve to be thrown out of France because they fail to integrate, bringing crime and mafia-style gangs with them. He said in September: 'I approved the dismantling of these veritable slums that represent a danger both for the people of Roma origin, but also of course the people who live in working-class neighborhoods. 'We don’t have the obligation to welcome these populations; we need to say it clearly and calmly. It is not about stigmatizing a population, but facing the truth.'

"Flying ace: Captain Mike Stephens with his spitfire plane during World War Two . A collection of medals awarded to a World War Two flying ace shot down a German bomber while he was one fire have sold for almost £100,000. Group Captain Mike Stephens was awarded an immediate Distinguished Service Order for his aerial heroics carried out when his plane was badly damaged and set on fire. Injured in both feet and with much of his engine and half his cockpit shot away, Grp Cpt Stephens prepared to leap from the flying wreckage. But when the Luftwaffe pilot who had attacked him flew ahead, he calmly climbed back into his Hurricane fighter-bomber and shot the enemy Messerschmitt down. It was only then that he jumped to safety, while on fire. He beat the flames out as he parachuted to the ground before landing just 300 yards from the German front line. He hobbled towards friendly lines in the Western Desert before being picked up by Polish troops. The action, in December 1941 over Acroma, Lybia, was one of many acts of heroism carried out by the 'ace' who bagged an estimated 22 enemy craft during the war. As well as the DSO, he won the Distinguished Flying Cross with two bars. Now the medals as well as other mementoes including his log book, photographs and a flying helmet with oxygen mask have been sold by his son. And the price well exceeded the pre-sale estimate of £30,000 to £50,000 pounds. The hammer price paid was £78,000 and with premiums went up to £93,600 pounds. David Erskine-Hill, of Dix Noonan Webb medal specialist auction house that sold the group, said it was bought by an agent for a collector. He said: “The strong price paid for the decoration fully reflected an extraordianry war-time career.” Cpt Stephens' medals: The Distinguished Service Order medal, far right, was among the haul that sold for almost £100,000 at auction . The episode for which Grp Cpt Stephens received the DSO was identical to one carried out by legendary Wing Commander Eric Nicolson, who received the Victoria Cross for it. Grp Cpt Stephens’ war is as astonishing as any of the aces who fought in the skies and he ranks in the top dozen for kills, but the speed with which he got was astonishing. His career was also unique because he was admitted to three informal RAF ‘clubs’ for wartime pilots. They were the Caterpillar Club, for those who baled out with a parachute; the Goldfish Club, for those who baled out into water; and the Flying Boot Club, for those who came down in the desert and had to walk to friendly lines. Mr Erskine-Hill said: 'The remarkable wartime career of Mike Stephens epitomises the sustained gallantry displayed by the young pilots of Fighter Command. Brave: Cpt Stephens (second left) in front of his spitfire with fellow flyers. His Hurricane bomber was written off after the crash over the Libyan desert in which he performed his heroics . This time he made it back: Cpt Stephens inspects damage to his spitfire following a sortie in December 1941, shortly before the mission in the Hurricane, which didn't make it back . 'It was a career encompassing several hundred combat sorties and the award of four decorations for gallantry - only 15 airmen received the combination of a DSO and DFC with two Bars in the 1939-45 War. 'A fighter ace three times over and, on account of having to take to his parachute on two occasions, once over water, he was also a member of the Caterpillar, Flying Boot and Goldfish Clubs. 'Most notable of his wartime combats was the occasion on which he was wounded when his Hurricane was set ablaze by an attacking Me. 109 over the Western Desert - as he was in the process of baling out his adversary overshot his crippled aircraft. Memories: A sketch of Cpt Stephens in his uniform, left, and right, with his wife on Investiture Day . Family tradition: The much decorated Stephens brothers Richard (left) and Jack (centre) with Captain Stephens (right) 'So Stephens regained his cockpit and shot it down, before taking to his parachute in burning overalls, a remarkable act of gallantry witnessed by Polish troops on the ground. 'A little over a year earlier, at the height of the Battle of Britain, Flight Lieutenant Nicolson had been awarded the VC for an identical act of bravery, though on this occasion Stephens was rewarded with an immediate DSO. He was just 22 years of age.' Grp Cpt Stephens graduated from RAF Cranwell, Lincs, in 1939 and was posted to France where he was quickly in the thick of the action, shooting down enemy planes. History: A collection of mementos and photographs also included in the auction that belonged to Cpt Stephens. The entire lot fetched almost £100,000 . Cpt Stephens' flying helmet with oxygen mask, which were also among the medals that were auctioned . Returning from his final sortie in France he had six inches shot off one of his propeller blades but landed the unsteady machine at the airfield. He was told that he couldn’t take off with the propeller damage and the plane would have to be destroyed. But the plucky pilot had six inches taken off the other end of the propeller and made it back to Britain. Grp Cpt Stephens then went to Turkey and north Africa where he continued to shoot down enemy planes and survive close shaves himself. In October 1942 he volunteered to go to Malta and remained lethal in the skies but came close to death, as his logbook records. Close call: Cpt Stephens' picture of a crashed spitfire at Skellingtons air strip. Like Cpt Stephens did when battling the Messerschmitt, the pilot of this would have ejected . War heroes: Mike Stephens (second right) with fellow flyers from the 185 squadron. The picture was also included in the auction . Relaxing: Cpt Stephens (right) with fellow flyers from a bomber squadron . He wrote: 'Squirting 109 good and proper, got him smoking when a Spit (Stead) pulled up in front of me, so had to stop. Shot the port wing off another at 7,000, then later was bounced by a 109 who damaged my engine. 'Flew on a little way and then had to bale out. Trouble with dinghy, picked up after 3 hours. Moral - know your dinghy drill!' What he didn’t add was that the dingy operation was made difficult because he kept his left hand in the air throughout because he was wearing a watch his parents had bought him and didn’t want to break it. In May 1943 Stephens was awarded his third DFC and returned home and saw no further action. He retired from the RAF in 1960 and worked in the aero-engines division of Rolls-Royce in Paris. He retired with his late wife Violet to the south of France before they returned to live out their days in Britain. Grp Capt Stephens died in 2004 aged 84.","Group Captain Mike Stephen climbed back into his Hurricane fighter-bomber to shoot down a German Messerschmitt with moments to spare .

"A trio of Chilean engineering students may have found a way to thwart even the best bicycle thief with the world's first 'unstealable bike.' The design, called the Yerka, looks like most bikes on an average city street, but the bottom tube of the frame can be split into two parts and wrapped around a pole. It is then secured to the pole or tree using the seat post to connect the arms, and locked shut. Scroll down for video . The design, called the Yerka, looks like most bikes on an average city street, but the bottom tube of the frame can be split into two parts and wrapped around a pole . 'The three of us have always been bike enthusiasts since kids, we love to use them as transportation or as a simple way to have fun,' Juan José Monsalve told Fox News. He created the bike with partners Cristóbal Cabello and Andrés Roi. 'Sadly, Andrés had two of his bikes stolen in a short period of tim, Monsale added. 'A few years ago we took an engineering design class at Adolfo Ibáñez University here in Chile and were asked to solve a problem to an actual commute. Using Andrés’ experience as a starting point we started to throw ideas to the table trying to solve this problem, and finally came up with something very similar to what we have today.' The company is working on prototypes that will connect combination locks to your smartphone via Bluetooth. Cristobal Cabello poses for a picture with the Yerka Project, a prototype for an unstealable bike at a bicycle trail in Santiago, Chile . While they call it the world's first unstealable bike, critics say the lock could be picked or the bike easily destroyed. 'Remember how people used to open those ubiquitous cylinder locks with a Bic pen? Any lock can be picked and the bike stolen,' said Lloyd Alter, the managing editor at the website TreeHugger.

"Car giant Volvo is developing 'no death' cars that drive themselves and are impossible to crash – ready for launch in showrooms within eight years. The computerised vehicles will  be fitted with high-tech sensors and will 'refuse to be steered' into other objects. Volvo says they will be  on sale to customers by 2020, but that some of the life-saving technology will be incorporated into its vehicles even earlier – from 2014 – it says. Scroll down for video . Key elements of the Highway Code are to be re-written to stop driverless cars bringing gridlock, pictured Volvo S40s have been  fitted with dozens of sensors allowing it to monitor pedestrians and other traffic . Sensors will also work at high speeds, ensuring the car is a safe distance from surrounding vehicles . Ford’s global  chairman Bill Ford . Jnr,  great grandson of automotive pioneer Henry Ford, announced earlier . this year that motorists will soon be able to tell their car ‘switch . to auto-pilot’. He stressed that much of the . technology was already being developed, trialled and tested at Ford . engineering and  research  centres, such as at Aachen in Germany and . Dunton in Essex. Mr Ford predicts: . Volvo's head of government affairs . Anders Eugensson said: ‘Our vision is that no one is killed or injured . in a new Volvo by 2020.’ Swedish-based . Volvo  - now owned by China's Geely group - said the first versions of . its crash-free cars would meant for driving in towns at a maximum speed . of 31mph. It . is part of the race by leading car manufacturers including Volvo, Ford . Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Vauxhall and even Google to build fully automomous . ‘Robo-cars’ that can drive themselves – like the one which actor Will . Smith drove in the sci-fi movie ‘I, Robot.’ The . biggest hurdle is not the technology which is largely developed – but . public acceptance of it and and issues of who would be liable if a . crashproof car did actually crash: the driver or the manufacturer? Volvo’s . Mr Eugensson said;’We have tested prototypes on thousands of miles of . test drives on public roads in Spain and on the company's test track in . western Sweden. ‘The car of the future will be like the farmer's horse.' 'The farmer can steer the horse and carriage but if he falls asleep the horse will refuse to walk into a tree or off a cliff.’ The . 85-year-old company - which has always prided itself on producing the . world's safest cars and developed the three-point seat-belt - said it . hoped to launch the first vehicles in 2014 at speeds of up to 31 mph – . for use in heavy urban traffic -  with totally accident free vehicles at . higher speeds by 2020. Moves . are already underway to amend international law under the Vienna . Convention on Road traffic which would remove current blocks on fully . autonomous vehicles. he convention, which underpins EU and UK law, says the driver must be in control of the vehicle at all times. New technology means that need not be the case. Volvo . has had 50 engineers working with automotive partners such as Ricardo . U.K. on the new crash-proof car technology over the last several years. Its . prototypes have run thousands of miles of test drives on public roads . in Spain and on the company’s test track in western Sweden. Marcus Rothoff, head of developing . Volvo’s driver assistance technology said: 'We are convinced this is the . future and we want to get there first’. Volvo has built some of the collision sensors into its current S40, and plans to have more advanced systems in cars by 2014 . For sceptics who say it’s pie in the . sky, industry experts and bosses  point out that the same was said of . satellite-navigation, air-bags, self-parking car systems, sensors which . ‘see’ white lines and  keep vehicles in their motorway lanes, collision . avoidance and  autonomous cruise control that brakes automatically the . car if it comes to close to the vehicle in front - all of which are . features on cars  sold in showrooms today. Mercedes-Benz’s next generation . flagship  S-Class which goes on sale next early year. Incorporates a . self-braking system that operates at speeds of up to 124 mph on German . motorways, as well as in towns. US internet search engine Google has also been testing its own prototype of a self-driving car since 2010. Volvo . is also working on a system  to enable motorists  to safely  and . legally read, send e-mails make phone calls or have a snooze while . driving at the wheel under a new ‘commuter car ’ system it  has . developed. It turns convoys of vehicles into self-driving ‘road-trains.’ The Swedish car maker’s project . permits  lines of up to six cars dive autonomously almost bumper to . bumper  while driver switches off, does some office work, reads a book . or has a snooze while letting the road-train convoy  take the strain. Each car’s braking, acceleration . and steering is instead all controlled electronically by a lead  truck – . driven by a professional driver -  at the head of the line. The truck uses  radio signals to control the cars behind it. All the vehicles are fitted with  a . special computerised control unit fitted to their engine management . systems to tell the car when to accelerate, brake and steer without any . input from the driver. Once a vehicle is ‘locked on’  to . the convoy a system of lasers and sensors helps keep the cars a safe . distance from one another. The technology has been developed for Volvo by British firm Ricardo. Drivers can signal their intention . to leave the convoy and resume control of the car by simply pressing a . button on the dashboard. Volvo has spent the last three . years working on the Safe Road Trains for the Environment project known . as SARTRE – in a play on the name of the French existentialist . philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre who famously and here fittingly  said: . ‘Hell is other people’ and ‘Man is condemned to be free. ’ Volvo has begun testing the driverless-car technology. Here, a driver drinks tea as his car automatically drives itself, keeping a safe distance from the lorry in front . It has been made possible thanks to £5.1million of funding from the European union. Experts say self-drive cars are potentially safer because they take the risk of human error out of motoring. Volvo says the car train is ideal for lengthy motorway journeys. Not only do drivers make better use of their time, but the smoother journey cuts fuel consumption by 20 per cent.","Vehicle will be fitted with sensors that can detect potential collisions and take action .

"At least two of the three men involved in a possible Al Qaida plot to pull off an attack coinciding with the 10th anniversary of 9/11 are believed to be U.S. citizens or have U.S. travelling documents. Their primary mission is to explode a car bomb in either New York or Washington, but if that proves impossible, they have been ordered to simply cause as much destruction as they can, one U.S. official said. Word that al-Qaida had dispatched would-be attackers reached U.S. officials midweek. Duty: New York Police Department  tactical police officers stand guard near the New York Stock Exchange . A CIA informant who has proven reliable in the past approached intelligence officials overseas to say that the men had been ordered by newly minted al-Qaida leader Ayman al Zawahri to mark the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks Sunday by doing harm on U.S. soil. The news comes as a massive security operation was under way in New York and Washington D.C. prompted after U.S. spy networks intercepted communications from an Al Qaeda operative in Pakistan. The 'chatter' indicated plans to attack the capital and New York on the 10th anniversary of 9/11, a senior security source indicated tonight. The news comes as thousands of anti-terror officers will flooded the streets tonight and radiation detecting boats were . patrolling the water as America was put on heightened alert of a terror . strike to coincide with Sunday's grim milestone. Heightened patrols: A New York Police Department Hercules team on patrol near Penn Station in New York . Sources revealed the terror cell . has been instructed by al Qaeda and could be targeting subways, tunnels and bridges around Manhattan, but other big . cities, including Los Angeles and Chicago, are also on red alert. Speaking on condition of anonymity, one U.S. official said on Friday there was reason to believe the threat may be linked to al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahri. Zawahri took the reins of al Qaeda after Osama bin Laden was killed in May in a U.S. raid in Pakistan. The intelligence received this week included possible threats of attacks targeting subways or commuter trains as well as possible car bomb attacks in New York or Washington, U.S. officials said. Freedom: Mayor Bloomberg said he was riding the subway as normal today to assure his residents that New York was prepared for any terror attack . New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said: 'We have to be concerned. Terrorism is theater and this is a stage, right now probably the world's biggest stage.' Some senior officials however have poured cold water on the al-Zawahiri link, saying he has had only limited involvement in al Qaeda operations, knowing he is the primary U.S. target after the killings of Osama bin Laden in May and top al-Qaida strategist Abu Abd al-Rahman Atiyyat Allah last month. 'Bin Laden was more involved in al Qaeda operations than al-Zawahiri,' a senior official said. 'He's too busy trying to stay alive.' Regardless, the White House believes some element of al Qaeda is behind the threat — just not al-Zawahiri himself. More dog patrols:  A New York Police Department  member holds his dog as he patrols near Columbus Circle . New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg today rode the subway to work in a bid to assure his residents that New York is prepared for any terror attack. He reiterated that the threat was 'credible' but said there . was 'no reason' for Americans to 'lock ourselves in our houses and lose . the freedoms that the terrorists want us to give up.' 'Are we increasing it a little more? Yeah,' the Mr Bloomberg said on his weekly WOR radio show. 'But there's a . limit on how much you can have because you can't have a cop on every . corner.' Without giving specific details of the new threat, the mayor said it was being taken seriously because it wasn't 'outlandish'. And after getting off the train near . the Brooklyn Bridge, Mr Bloomberg urged New Yorkers to just: 'Go back to . work. And leave it to the professionals.' His words came as Vice . President Joe Biden said that while intelligence on a potential terror . plot against U.S. cities came from a credible source, there is 'no . certitude' an attack has been planned. Mr Biden said he and President Obama . had been briefed on intelligence developed by the CIA that three men may . have entered the country with the intent to launch a vehicle-bomb . attack. Salute: USS New York passes the World Trade Center as it arrived in Manhattan on Thursday . 'We do have talk about using a car . bomb. We've been told that was an intention... from a credible source,' Mr Biden said on Good Morning America. 'But we do not have confirmation . of that. We don't have a smoking gun.' However, a source told the New York Post: 'It does feel more operational than most of the others we’ve had that have been more aspirational.' The information, which came from chatter . picked up overseas by the CIA, said the attack would occur on the 10th, . 11th or 12th, another source told the paper. Federal officials said yesterday that three . individuals - one believed to be a U.S. citizen - entered the country . last month by air with 'intent' to carry out a terrorist plot against . Washington, D.C. or New York. Police sources told reporters the . individuals are believed to have come to the U.S. via Afghanistan or Pakistan with . at lease one stop in another country, possibly Iran. Business as usual: New Yorkers gather outside a gallery for Fashion Night in Soho as the Tribute in Light sends twin beams to the heavens in the background . Patriotic: One World Trade Center is bathed in red white and blue as it lights up the New York skyline . The FBI and Homeland Security . Department issued a joint intelligence bulletin last night to law . enforcement around the country urging them to maintain increased . security and be on the lookout for suspicious activity. 'There is specific, credible but . unconfirmed threat information,' the head of the FBI's New York . division, Janice Fedarcyk, said. 'As we always do before important . dates like the anniversary of 9/11, we will undoubtedly get more . reporting in the coming days.' Mr Bloomberg told . reporters the city's observance of the attacks will go on as planned. In Washington, law enforcement . officials said they were working 12-hour days indefinitely, and Police . Chief Cathy Lanier said unattended cars parked in unusual locations . risked being towed. Intelligence officials have warned of 'lots of chatter' on jihadi websites about the imminent anniversary of 9/11, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, pictured, said yesterday. The department will be at a heightened level of readiness as the U.S. commemorates the anniversary but, she said, nothing yet warrants raising the terrorist threat status. CNN reported Ms Napolitano as saying: 'We don't have something that would reach that standard, but we still have lots of chatter out there. And we take every bit of that seriously and are tracking it down.' She said the anniversary would likely be an 'iconic' day for al Qaeda. But despite the heightened level of threat she declined to give out details of security preparations. 'I don't want to give those (details) out because I don't want to tell the bad guys exactly what we're doing,' she said. 'But I think it's fair to say that in addition to asking citizens to be vigilant and so forth, that we have ourselves leaned forward and have made sure that we are doing all that we can from the DHS perspective.' Briefed on the threat information . yesterday morning, President Obama directed U.S. counter-terrorism agencies to redouble their efforts, a White House . official said. A White House official yesterday told . ABC: 'The President was briefed on this specific threat information this . morning and has been updated on it throughout the day. 'The United States government has . already significantly enhanced its security posture in advance of the . 9/11 anniversary to protect the country against possible terrorist . threats. 'Nevertheless, the President directed . the counter-terrorism community to redouble its efforts in response to . this credible but unconfirmed information.' As of late last night, there were no . plans to change Mr Obama's travel schedule on Sunday in light of the . threat, the White House said. The president is scheduled to mark the . September 11 anniversary with stops at New York's Ground Zero, the Pentagon . and Shanksville, Pennsylvania. He also will deliver a speech on Sunday night at a memorial concert at the Kennedy Centre in Washington. The Department of Homeland Security, . which said only last week that there was no credible information that al . Qaeda was plotting an attack around the September 11 anniversary, . declined to offer details on the threat. It cautioned that there were always threat reports before important dates like the anniversary of the September 11 attacks. Spokesman Matt Chandler said: . 'Sometimes this reporting is credible and warrants intense focus, other . times it lacks credibility and is highly unlikely to be reflective of . real plots under way.' 'Regardless, we take all threat . reporting seriously, and we have taken, and will continue to take all . steps necessary to mitigate any threats that arise.' A second law-enforcement source played . down an ABC News report about missing rental trucks - saying the . vehicles had been recovered and there was no connection to terrorism. At the press conference Mr Bloomberg spoke about . additional precautions being taken in the event potential threats were . confirmed. The mayor said intelligence agencies have been on 'heightened alert' as the anniversary of the 9/11 . attacks approaches. He advised New Yorkers not to change their daily routines but to be vigilant in reporting anything suspicious. Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said . heightened security measures would include increased bag inspections on . the city's mass transit system, increased deployment of radiation . monitoring equipment, increased focus on landmark, houses of worship and . government buildings and increased bomb sweeps of parking garages and . other locations. On alert: New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Commissioner of the New York City Police Department Raymond Kelly enter a news conference to discuss a new terrorist threat .

"The National Council for Civil Liberties placed a recruitment advert for new members in the house  magazine of the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange, it emerged yesterday. Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman and her MP husband Jack Dromey say PIE was banished before she became the NCCL’s legal officer in 1978. But disturbing new evidence contradicts this claim – and reveals further embarrassingly close ties between the NCCL and the paedophile group campaigning to legalise sex with children. Scroll down for video . Sick: The NCCL ran a the appeal for members next to a picture of a young boy in what appears to be a PE kit . Fees: The advert in PIE's in-house magazine listed membership prices . The Mail can reveal that: . ■ In 1979, an edition of Magpie, PIE’s official journal, carried the NCCL appeal for new members in an appalling ‘Year of the Child’ edition. ■ Former health minister and NCCL general secretary Patricia Hewitt shared a conference platform with PIE leader Tom O’Carroll in 1977. Details of the new links came as O’Carroll claimed the two women ‘didn’t even try’ to remove the paedophile group from the NCCL in case it harmed their careers. The three senior Labour figures all held key roles in the council – which astonishingly granted ‘affiliate’ status to the group of predatory paedophiles that was calling for the age of consent to be cut to just four. When Miss Harman earlier this week belatedly expressed ‘regret’ – but refused to apologise – for PIE being allowed to forge links with the NCCL, she said the paedophile group ‘had been pushed to the margin’ before she began working there. Yet, during the year after she took up her post, the NCCL advert appeared in PIE’s April journal. It ran inside a shocking 24-page special edition of the magazine – the cover of which shows a picture of a young boy wearing only a small pair of shorts as he plays tennis. On an inside page the council’s advert appears alongside two more pictures of young boys in provocative poses, including one in what appears to be a PE kit, sitting down with his legs apart. It invites Magpie readers to ‘join the NCCL’ and boasts that the organisation is ‘working to protect and extend human rights in the UK’. The appeal for new members and donations was published after a feature titled: Child porn, a heterosexual viewpoint. The journal, sent to PIE members, included news on paedophiles, articles on child porn and cartoons mocking assaults on children. These depicted abuse in a scout master’s tent, naked children and adults queuing up outside a bedroom for an ‘assault course’. The ‘year of the child’ edition – a distasteful twist on the UN designating 1979 as the ‘International Year of the Child’ – came with a ‘contact page’, which members could use to get in touch with other paedophiles, share images and advertise for children to abuse. Harriet Harman has expressed regret that a civil liberties group she and her husband Jack Dromey MP worked for in the 1970s had links with a pro-paedophile campaigning group . Miss Hewitt shared a platform with PIE founder O’Carroll at a gay rights conference organised by the NCCL. The former Labour minister appeared with him at the one-day event entitled ‘A Fairer Deal for Homosexuals’ and organised by the council’s Gay Rights Committee. A cutting from the left-wing Morning Star, said Miss Hewitt ‘spoke of the council’s work on gay rights over the past two years’. An item in Magpie from May 1977 confirms that O’Carroll addressed the NCCL conference. Under the heading ‘Notes and news’, it states: ‘Tom O’Carroll, our secretary, was one of two speakers talking about the treatment of sexual offenders in prison at the one day-conference organised by the Gay Rights Committee of the NCCL on May 14th.’ O’Carroll condemned the practice of chemical castration of paedophiles during a discussion at the event. A file about the conference in the archives of the NCCL – which later became the respected pressure group Liberty – at the Hull History Centre contains a paper O’Carroll prepared on chemical castration, which was due to be included in a booklet by the council published in 1978. Conference: Former Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt (left) shared a platform with leader of PIE Tom O'Carroll . But Miss Hewitt objected to the essay’s inclusion and said the group should be trying to destroy the myth that ‘gay men are also paedophiles’, not add to the confusion by ‘including a paper about the treatment of paedophile offenders in a pamphlet on gay rights’. In a memo in June 1978, she reported encountering opposition to her decision to pull O’Carroll’s work from her own gay rights sub-committee. It states that the NCCL Executive Committee would have to decide whether or not to include O’Carroll’s work in the pamphlet. A copy of what appears to be the final version in the file does not contain O’Carroll’s piece. Documents from both groups also reveal how, in the first half of 1977, the NCCL went in to bat for PIE when the vile group believed it had been slighted by a judge during his sentencing of a man convicted of blackmailing one of its member. Edited extracts from the correspondence reprinted in Magpie show how the NCCL described it as a ‘campaigning’ organisation. The letters were apparently written by Nettie Pollard, NCCL’s gay rights organiser. Speaking to the Radio 4 Today Programme O’Carroll said: ‘At the time Harman and Hewitt couldn’t just kick us out, or they could but they didn’t try. The reason was their careers in the NCCL depended upon them not rocking the boat too much.’","Abuse group leader, Tom O'Carroll said: they didn't try and make us leave .

"A second daughter of a 'fagin' mother who ran a lucrative family business selling goods online that the family stole from shops has been jailed. Dawn Bainbridge led a 'family business' which involved her and her daughters stealing thousands and thousands of pounds-worth of clothes from high street stores across the North which they then sold on Facebook. Their company, 'Designer Goods North East', took more than £7,000 in online payments in just four months, had detailed sales records and a debtors' book. Caitlyn Bainbridge, left, has been jaild for 16 months for being involved in a family business where goods were stolen from high street stores then sold online; her mother, Dawn, right, was the ringleader . In a note seized by police, Bainbridge's daughter Caitlyn Bainbridge, 19, boasted of making £100 a week and dreamed of going it alone. At Newcastle Crown Court last month Judge Sean Morris jailed Bainbridge, 47, for 30 months and her 21-year old daughter Claire for 20 months. Then yesterday Caitlyn, 19, was sentenced to 16 months jail. Judge Morris told her: 'This was a professional, criminal family firm. 'You played your part, you were the banker, you were the marketer, you went out on some trips as well. 'Thousands and thousads of pounds worth of goods were taken in professional, planned shoplifting expeditions and professionally marketed by you on your own Paypal account and with money being withdrawn to distribute amongst the directors of the firm, your mother and your older sister.' When police raided the family home in West Rainton, County Durham, in March, they recovered goods stolen from Next, House of Fraser, Marks and Spencer and elsewhere worth nearly £7,000 . At Bainbridge's sentencing the court was told she was the 'mother and leader of the criminal firm'. The judge said: 'You are the villain of the piece. It's your fault your daughters are in court. Some mother.' Jamie Adams, defending Caitlyn, said: 'The whole scenario is reminiscent of something Dickens would write about. 'Fagin comes to mind in the form of her mother.' The family stole from stores in Leeds, Bradford, Guiseley, York, Knaresborough, Harrogate, Stockton, Bishop Auckland, Durham, Gateshead and Edinburgh. Their operation was uncovered by an investigator for high street chain Next, who bought clothes and proved them to have been stolen. When police raided the family home in West Rainton, County Durham, in March, they recovered goods stolen from Next, House of Fraser, Marks and Spencer and elsewhere worth nearly £7,000. But still the thieving continued. Police seized a further £900-worth of stolen goods in June.

"Tough new Alabama immigration laws are forcing even legal migrants workers to flee the southern state over fears they will be deported. Regulations introduced last week seen as the toughest in America have caused a mass exodus in the state, which experts say could cripple Alabama's economy. A staggering one quarter of commercial building workers are thought to have left the state since tight regulations were introduced. Exodus: Tomato farmer Kassi Cruz picks tomatoes alone on a farm in Alabama after dozens of Hispanic workers did not show up for work for fear of being deported . Staying away: Casey Smith, a potato farmer, said just five of his 25 staff turned up for work following the strict immigration rules introduced last week . Masses of legal Hispanic workers are leaving Alabama because family members and friends don't have the correct paperwork and they fear they could be jailed. Many are fleeing to Tennessee or Washington, while those who are staying are 'trying not to go out as much'. Under strict rules brought in last week, schools have to check the immigration status of newly enrolled children. Immigration laws in Alabama also allow police to ask for papers showing citizenship or immigration status during traffic stops if they have a 'reasonable suspicion' that the person may be in the country illegally. As a result, over 800 Hispanic pupils have either withdrawn or not returned to state schools, while an estimated one quarter of the commercial building work force has left since last week. Elsewhere, one fruit farmer told how just eight of a near 50-strong workforce returned to work last week. Rick Pate, the owner of a commercial landscaping company in Montgomery, lost two of his most experienced workers, who were in the country legally. Mr Smith's sweet potato-picking workforce in Cullman, Alabama, is one of many to have been dramatically reduced due to immigration rules . School's out: Flowers School in Montgomery, Alabama, is one of many to have seen Hispanic pupils stay away . He said: 'They just feel like there is a negative atmosphere for them here. They don't feel welcome. I don't begrudge them. I'd feel nervous, too.' Commercial construction is a more than $7 billion-a-year industry in Alabama. The law targets employers by forbidding drivers from stopping along a road to hire temporary workers. It also bars businesses from taking tax deductions for wages paid to illegal workers and makes it a crime for an illegal immigrant to solicit work. A federal judge has temporarily blocked those sections of the law so she can study them more. Legislators said the law would help legal residents suffering from nearly 10 percent unemployment. One of the bill's authors, Republican Sen. Scott Beason, defended the legislation by saying he expected short-term problems, and that he has received 'thank you' calls from two people who replaced illegal immigrants who fled their jobs. 'We have the best law in the country and I stand by what we've done,' Beason said. However, on Chandler Mountain in north Alabama, tomato farmer Lana Boatwright said only eight of the 48 Hispanic workers she needed for harvest showed up after the law took effect. Those who did were frightened. 'My husband and I take them to the grocery store at night and shop for them because they are afraid they will be arrested,' she said. Farmer Chad Smith said his family farm stands to lose up to $150,000 because there are not enough workers to pick tomatoes spoiling in the fields. 'We will be lucky to be in business next year,' he said. Many tomato crops in Alabama have rotting fruit due to legal workers staying away from their jobs . The huge reduction in the workforce is set to have a damaging effect on Alabama's economy . The financial toll will vary by area, and experts said it's too early to make predictions. In Tuscaloosa, there is still a lot of rebuilding to be done after Alabama's killer tornadoes in April. Without the Hispanic workers to help out, it will take even longer for neighborhoods to be fixed up. Blake Corder, the president of the Home Builders Association of Tuscaloosa, noted that the workers had left the area and he even lost a few renters in the past week. Likewise, schools are worried about their students who have suddenly stopped showing up for class. Out of 34,000 Hispanic students, 2,285 were absent Monday. That number increased from Friday by a few hundred. The figures show seven out of every 100 Hispanic children were out of school, even though state school officials have tried to assure parents that they won't release their names to police and that no child will be denied an education due to legal status. Builders have complained they can't find replacement workers and delays in projects are expected. Russell Davis, executive vice president of the Home Builders Association of Alabama, said: 'Once the economy picks up and construction returns to normal, the impact will increase. 'There is going to be a void. No question.'","Hispanic fruit pickers 'frightened to come to work'

"Two prisoners were beheaded and at least another one died after being thrown off the roof in a riot that erupted Sunday in a prison in southern Brazil, authorities said. Inmates of the penitentiary in the city of Cascavel took at least two agents and several other inmates hostage in the uprising, said military police Capt. Ricardo Pinto. He said negotiations for better conditions in the prison were still under way 12 hours later. Prisoners set some objects on fire and were using metal poles to cause damage to the 928-bed prison that housed more than 1,000 inmates at the time. Inmates rioting for better facilities in a Brazilian jail killed four fellow prisoners, decapitating two of them, and took two guards hostage, officials have said .

Screen grab from Globo News television showing inmates holding a hostage  on the roof of the penitentiary in Cascavel, Parana state . Riot: Police in Brazil say rioters in a jail in the southern city of Cascavel have killed three fellow inmates and injured several others as part of a violent push for better conditions. Pictured here is a nearby prison in Parana . Authorities initially said two men were decapitated, and later learned of a third prisoner who was also killed after he was thrown off the building. The three men were not identified. The revolt began before sunrise when a prison guard was captured during breakfast, Pinto said. Dozens of the prisoners climbed onto the building's rooftop, with their faces covered with white fabric. Local media images showed at least 30 rebellious inmates shouting while they beat men held with ropes around their necks, or whose hands were tied behind them.

The rioting inmates waved banners emblazoned with the initials PCC for a criminal prison gang formed in the 1990s. Jairo Ferreira, a lawyer for the prison guards' union, told local news site CGN that at one point the inmates put the decapitated head of one victim on the lap of a custodian who was initially held hostage and later freed. Relatives arriving at the prison to visit inmates waited outside as night fell, trying to get information about their loved ones. Ferreira said the prisoners rioted to demand better food and medical care in the prison. Police Capt. Pinto said the revolt may also have been related to the recent convictions of two prisoners.","About 80 percent of penitentiary in Cascavel taken over by prisoners .

"Police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann want to question British ex-pat Robert Murat, a Portuguese newspaper reported yesterday. Scotland Yard detectives want to speak to several potential witnesses including Mr Murat, who was previously questioned by Portuguese police after Madeleine vanished in 2007 just before her fourth birthday, the newspaper Jornal de Noticias reported. Mr Murat, 41, who has always denied any involvement in Madeleine’s disappearance, said neither he nor his lawyer had been contacted by police, but said he would co-operate if contacted. Robert Murat pictured in Praia da Luz, in August 2007. Mr Murat has said he would have no problem speaking to police again if they wished . He told the Guardian: ‘My conscience is clear and I have no problem speaking to police again.’ His lawyer Francisco Pagarete told the Daily Mail: ‘My client has not been sent any notification from any official. If the police want to talk to my client it is ok, he will talk to them.’ Mr Murat was named as an arguido – a person of interest or suspect - during the Portuguese investigation seven years ago, as were Madeleine’s parents Kate and Gerry McCann. All three were later cleared when the Portuguese investigation ended in 2008. Scotland Yard launched its own investigation and its inquiry team travelled to Praia da Luz to conduct searches and observe Portuguese police interviews. The Operation Grange inquiry team has reportedly asked Portuguese police to question four potential witnesses, including Mr Murat. Mr Murat lived only a few hundred yards from the holiday flat where Kate and Gerry McCann's (pictured) daughter Madeleine disappeared . Madeleine McCann (pictured left and right) went missing in 2007, aged three. The case has become one of the most high profile missing children cases in Britain's history . The property consultant lived in Praia da Luz in 2007, only a few hundred yards from the McCanns’ rented holiday flat where Madeleine vanished. Mr Murat was later paid £600,000 in libel damages by 11 British newspapers, including the Daily Mail, and the broadcaster Sky over reports which falsely alleged there were strong grounds for believing he was involved in her disappearance. A Scotland Yard spokeswoman refused to comment on the Portuguese article and said the force would not give ‘a running commentary’ on its investigation.","Police want to speak to ex-pat Robert Murat, Portuguese paper claims .

"Miracle baby: Anna Binks with her long-awaited daughter Esme . This is the miracle baby - born after ten years and ten fertility treatments. Esme Binks was born five months ago after a lengthy battle which cost her mother Anna a staggering £35,000. Anna, 34, has undergone ten tries at IVF treatment in the last decade - but says it has finally been worth it to have her miracle daughter. Anna, who works for Macmillan cancer support, and lives in Hull with husband Phil, 40, a fireman, said: ‘It has been an incredible emotional battle to have Esme and there were plenty of times when I thought I would never be a mum. ‘She has cost a lot of money, but she has been worth every penny. She’s our miracle daughter.’ Anna’s battle began back in 2002, when she began trying for a baby with her former partner. She said: ‘He had some fertility problems and then I also found out that I had blocked fallopian tubes too, so I knew that we needed to have treatment.’ Anna had a first IVF attempt at a fertility clinic in Hull, but it didn’t work. She then underwent a course of artificial insemination, but again that did not work. She said: ‘I had been so hopeful the first time that it would work, and when it didn’t, it was devastating. Then when the second attempt failed too, it was heartbreaking. But I was determined to carry on. I wanted to have a baby more than anything in the world.’ Happy family: Anna and Phil Binks are thrilled to have Esme in their lives . Emotional: Esme was born ten years after Anna first started trying for a baby . She then had a further five attempts from November 2005 until April 2007. But she failed to fall pregnant. She said: ‘The doctors couldn’t understand what was going wrong. My embryos were always top quality yet nothing was happening. They eventually advised me to consider adoption as they didn’t think it was going to happen for me.’ Anna then went to CARE Fertility in Nottingham for help. She had another course of fertility treatment - her eighth - but it also failed. She said: ‘They had given me hope and told me not to give up, but it was still devastating to fail again. I’d had eight fertility treatments by now, and nothing. I thought I would never be a mum, but something inside me wouldn’t give up. Pretty in pink: Esme was born at Hull and East Yorkshire Hospital in January . 'I tried everything - supplements, acupuncture, and I read somewhere that wearing orange knickers encouraged fertility so I did that too. I was so desperate to try anything that may help.’ She had her ninth course of fertility treatment in July 2008 and fell pregnant, but devastatingly she miscarried the baby at 11 weeks. She said: ‘That was the lowest point. After all these years of trying, I had finally fallen pregnant, only to lose my baby. It was heartbreaking.’ Anna split with her partner and met her husband Phil 12 months later. They married in June 2011 and decided to have one last try at IVF. She had funded her previous attempts by selling her house and taking out loans. Dedication: Anna said that she funded her fertility attempts by selling her house and taking out loans . She said: ‘It was going to be my last attempt. We’d had some money for our wedding, so we decided to use that. I’d been trying for so long and had been through so many treatments. If this didn’t work, I had to finally accept that my battle was over and I was never going to be a mum.’ In April last year  Anna had her tenth course of treatment at CARE Fertility, and two weeks later she discovered she was pregnant. She said: ‘I was thrilled, but I was worried in case I lost this baby too. All the way through the pregnancy right up until I gave birth, I was still petrified that I was going to lose her.’ Esme arrived into the world at Hull and East Yorkshire Hospital in January weighing a healthy 7Ib11. She said: ‘It was the most amazing moment of my life when she was born and I held her in my arms for the first time. After ten years, ten fertility treatments and £35,000 I finally had my miracle daughter. Lucky: 'I would love to try for a brother or sister for Esme,' Anna said, 'but I would definitely have to win the lottery first!' ‘I just couldn’t stop crying, I couldn’t believe she was finally here. Phil was really emotional too.’Esme is now five months old and has a healthy appetite and loves a hearty sunday dinner. Anna added: ‘She is absolutely perfect and every day I look at her and think how lucky I am. I would love to try for a brother or sister for Esme, but I would definitely have to win the lottery first!’ Dr Phillip Lowe, from CARE Fertility, said: 'I see many couples with complex fertility problems – but Anna and Phil have the biggest set of case notes I’ve ever seen! It is extremely unusual to wait ten years to become pregnant. We were absolutely delighted to hear that Esme had arrived safe and sound after all this time.'","Anna Binks waited ten years to fall pregnant after ten fertility treatments .

'I began to focus on macro (extremely close-up) photography around 20 years ago, and snails are amongst my favourite things to photograph. 'They're fascinating creatures but the main reason I like to take pictures of snails is because they move so slowly there's no danger of them running off while i'm trying to take a picture.

"With a collection of watches worth almost £500,000, many would assume they belonged to a Russian oligarch. But Russian president Vladimir Putin has a collection of timepieces worth almost six times his official annual salary of £72,000.

The . video, titled 'Watches of a Kleptocrat' shows Mr Putin saying he would . continue with his battle against corruption in a video from 2007. It goes on to contrast the Russian president's watch with a £225 watch that President Obama has been seen wearing.

"Ofcom will investigate Rowan Atkinson’s foul-mouthed Comic Relief parody of the Archbishop of Canterbury, it announced today.

In his sketch, Mr Atkinson dressed as Church of England leader Justin Welby to give a mock fireside homily. At one point he said: ‘Jesus said love your neighbour and let’s be perfectly clear, because there’s a lot of misunderstanding about this, it doesn’t mean s*** your neighbour. He hates that, he absolutely hates that.’ He added: ‘When I was a young man – and I stress a heterosexual young man with quite a few girlfriends, though no tongues, obviously, teenagers beware – charity was much less fun than it is now. ‘However, behind the fun, or a**ing around as I like to call it – God doesn’t mind swearing, you know – behind the fun there is a more serious message.’ At the time, a BBC spokesman said Comic Relief is ‘known for pushing at the boundaries of comedy alongside heartfelt appeal films’ but added: ‘To any viewers we may have offended, we apologise.’ Yesterday, an Ofcom spokesman said: ‘Ofcom can confirm that it is currently investigating whether the use of offensive language on Comic Relief: Funny for Money was justified by context and whether the BBC applied generally accepted standards in the programme.’ Ofcom also ruled an episode of Alan Titchmarsh’s ITV chat show had breached broadcasting regulations.

"The Guardian has provoked anger after publishing an article that labelled the poppy artwork a ‘UKIP-style memorial’. Armed forces charities accused the left-wing newspaper of trying to politicise the tribute to those killed during the First World War. They sprang to the defence of the installation, called Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red, after the online article by a former Turner Prize judge described it as ‘trite, fake, and inward-looking’. An aerial view of the Tower of London showing the poppy installation called Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red. The Guardian has provoked anger by publishing an article that labelled the artwork as a 'UKIP-style memorial' In a provocative critique, author Jonathan Jones wrote: ‘The crowds come to remember – but we should not be remembering only our own. It’s the inward-looking mood that lets Ukip thrive. But that’s probably an overinterpretation, because the spectacle of all these red poppies is emptier than that. ‘In spite of the mention of blood in its title, this is a deeply aestheticised, prettified and toothless war memorial. Describing his preferred style of tribute, he wrote: ‘A meaningful mass memorial to this horror would not be dignified or pretty. It would be gory, vile and terrible to see. The moat of the Tower should be filled with barbed wire and bones. That would mean something.’ Social media users described the article as ridiculous, disrespectful and missing the point. In a provocative critique, former Turner Prize judge Jonathan Jones called it 'trite, fake and inward looking . And armed forces charities emphasised the way in which the artwork had caught the public’s imagination. Help for Heroes said it would not dignify an article that ‘tried to politicise a memorial’ with a response. A spokesman for armed forces charity SSAFA said: ‘The fact that hundreds of thousands of people have visited the installation to date, with many more expected as we head towards Remembrance, demonstrates how strongly the installation has resonated with the general public.’ A spokesman for the Historic Royal Palaces, which organised the memorial, said: ‘We have seen and read the article. It’s his opinion and we have nothing more to say about it. We’re just pleased with the way the public are responding to it – and that’s what’s more important to us. ‘We think it is incredibly evocative and we’ve seen people looking at it and being moved to tears just thinking about loved ones who died and the impact of war itself.’ Twitter user Jonny Wild wrote: ‘There are no words to express how disrespectful Jonathan Jones’ poppy article in the Guardian is – ridiculous piece of journalism.’ Journalist Ruth Green from Northern Ireland tweeted: ‘I saw the poppy installation last week. On so many levels Jonathan Jones has missed the point.’ But armed forces charities have emphasised they way in which the artwork has caught the public's imagination . Another user, tweeting under the name ‘Kemp1886’, said: ‘That Guardian article on the Poppy memorial is filth. Not remotely surprised though. No wonder circulation is so low.’ The article was published on what is thought to have been a record day for visitors at the memorial so far, with police brought in to help control the crowds. Visitors yesterday reported long queues to catch a glimpse of the memorial, but most were pleased to see so many keen to pay their respects. Sheila Bainbridge, 85, made the journey from Nottingham with her daughter, granddaughters and great-grandchildren. The President of the Women’s Section of the Royal British Legion in Radcliffe-on-Trent, whose late husband Sgt Laurie Bainbridge fought for the Royal Air Force on D-Day and helped liberate the Belsen concentration camp, said the sight was worth the wait. She said: ‘We don’t mind driving all the way down here and queuing to pay our respects.’ Undeterred by the crowds, her daughter Lynn Slater, 61, said: ‘It took us four hours to get here, we aren’t going to stop now.’ Visitor Angie Adriaanse, 65, from Wimbledon, told The Daily Mail: ‘I have never seen so many people.’ And one mum quipped: ‘I think the whole world has come today.’ Ray and Sue Smith, who travelled from Devizes, said it took them 30 minutes to get a good view. The couple said it was nice to see so many people take an interest, but Mr Smith, 68, said: ‘They are overwhelmed with crowds, they haven’t really planned how to cope.’ Millions of visitors have been to the installation including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry . Retired property developer Graham Barnes, 88, who travelled from Henley-on-Thames, said: ‘(The display) is staggering, very moving, and a wonderful way of commemorating the number killed in that war.’ And he said the crowd did not surprise him, adding: ‘We are a patriotic nation.’ Adela Everiss, 34, from Hillingdon, said she would be returning with her family early on Saturday to avoid the crowd, adding: ‘It is just too busy.’ Hayes man Alan Hammond, 82, said: ‘It is a bit chaotic.’ While his wife Jane, 81, added: ‘It is lovely, it really is, but you do have a job to see it.’ The millions of visitors to the installation include the Queen two weeks ago and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in August. Artist Mr Cummins, 37, yesterday revealed he had lost a finger making one of the poppies - which were sold for £25 each - when his hand was crushed by an industrial roller. The artwork – entitled Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red - has been slowly filling the moat around the Tower since July with the help of 8,000 volunteers. It is expected to raise more than £11million for charity before it is taken down the day after Armistice Day on November 11, when the final poppy is planted.","Guardian published an article labeling the artwork as a 'Ukip-style memorial .

"A farmer created a stunning tribute to his late wife by planting 7,000 trees in the shape of a guitar. Pedro Martin Ureta's labour of love is a memorial to Graciela Yraizoz, who loved the guitar and asked him to design the instrument on their farmland in Laboulaye, Argentina. But, tragically she died in 1977 while carrying their fifth child before it could come to fruition. Tribute: Pedro Martin Ureta used cypress and eucalyptus trees for the guitar in memory of his late wife Graciela . So, after her death, Mr Ureta and their four children planted every tree individually to create the stunning wood. The guitar stretches for two thirds of a mile and is so large that it has to be seen from the sky but Mr Ureta has never seen the full design because he is afraid of flying. He started the project in 1979, two . years after Graciela died. She suffered a ruptured cerebral aneurysm . during her fifth pregnancy and died aged just 25. Graciela first suggested the idea after flying over land and noticing that a farm looked a bit like a milking pail. Their son Ezequiel, 36, said his father was too busy at the time with work to take her plans seriously. However, after she died Mr Ureta said he regretted not fulfilling her wish. Daughter Soledad told the Washington Post: 'He used to talk about regrets, and it was clear he regretted not having listened to my mother about the guitar.' Mr Ureta's children said he regretted not taking Graciela's idea seriously and so spent years cultivating the forest as a memorial to her and he and his family planted each of the 7,000 trees individually . The tribute has been captured by satellite images but Mr Ureta has not seen it because he is scared of flying . She said once they started the . project all the children including elder brother Ignacio and sister . Maria Julia, would line up three meters apart and plant the trees where . they stood. The family used cypress trees to create the star-shaped sound hole and the . outline of the instrument and planted rows is composed of cypress trees to form the strings. They had to replant the saplings many . times because they were eaten by hares and wild guinea pigs but . eventually the trees began to grow. Maria Julia, 39, told the Washington Post: 'It was the closest thing possible to having my mother alive.' Although Mr Ureta, now 70, who also has an . 11-year-old daughter with his second partner Maria de los Angeles Ponzi, . has never seen the full scale of the forest from the sky, he has seen . the pictures. Labour of love: Winston Howes planted thousands of oak trees but left a heart as a tribute to his wife Janet . A farmer in the UK created a similar tribute to his wife, who died suddenly in 1995. Winston Howes planted thousands of oak saplings in a six-acre field in Wickwar, Gloucestershire, but left a heart-shaped meadow in the middle with the point facing towards his wife Janet's childhood home. It has since grown into a peaceful oasis where he says he can remember his wife of 33 years.","Argentine farmer Pedro Martin Ureta created the cypress and eucalyptus tree forest as a memorial to his wife Graciela Yraizoz who loved the guitar .

"Dorothy Simpson, 84, telephoned her family from the hospital because she could not breathe, and died 20 minutes later . A great-grandmother died after she made a desperate phone call to her family to tell them she could not breath because hospital staff failed to care for her. Dorothy Simpson's son rushed to Royal Bournemouth Hospital but when he arrived 20 minutes later she was already dead with an alarm still sounding. Hospital bosses have today admitted a catalogue of errors and apologised following the 84-year-old's tragic death. An investigation revealed failings in care and Chief Executive Tony Spotswood has now written to her family to say sorry. 'It is clear from our investigation that you and your family had a very poor experience whilst your mother was under our care, and for this I am extremely sorry,' he wrote. Mr Spotswood, admitted her son, Jim, . 'found her alone, with the observation machine alarming and sadly it . appeared that your mother had very recently passed away'. Mrs Simpson, a great-grandmother who lived at Hengistbury Head, Dorset, had telephoned her family to say she could not breathe and was getting no help from hospital staff. When one of her sons arrived at Ward 3 less than 20 minutes later, she had passed away and was alone, with an alarm sounding. The hospital's inquiry admitted Mrs Simpson 'should not have been left on her own at any stage'. It also said there was a 'delay in obtaining antibiotics in liquid form' and a reduced number of nurses on the ward at one point close to when she died. Apology: Bosses at Royal Bournemouth Hospital in Dorset have apologised to the family of distressed Dorothy Simpson because of her poor treatment . Failings: Royal Bournemouth Chief Executive Tony Spotswood has apologised to the family, but Mrs Simpson's son Steve, right, says they are 'very angry she was let down by professionals who just let her die, on her own' Mr Spotswood said there has since been a change in leadership on Ward 3 and a 'very experienced' ward sister has since been recruited. He also said staff encouraged her . to wear an oxygen mask less than an hour before she died on Saturday, . July 27, but she refused to do so. An action plan has been devised to address communication and attitudes of staff, as well as extra training and an electronic system is also being introduced to allow patients' observations to be recorded centrally. Mrs Simpson's son, Steve, said: 'She was an old lady with a terminal lung illness but that day, because of all the failings, she died before her time. 'I am very angry that she was let down by professionals who just let her die, on her own.' Mrs Simpson suffered from end stage lung disease and her family had been told she was unlikely to survive more than a few months.","Dorothy Simpson's son rushed to Bournemouth Hospital but was too late .

"A Missouri judge ordered the state on Monday to set free a man who was convicted of robbery in 2000 but never sent to prison until a clerical mistake was discovered last year. Cornealious 'Mike' Anderson was 23 when he was sentenced to 13 years in prison for his role in the robbery of a fast-food restaurant's assistant manager. He told The Associated Press last month that he waited, and even asked about going to prison, but the order never came. In the years since his conviction, Anderson started his own construction-related businesses, married and had children. He also coached youth football and volunteered at his church in Webster Groves, Missouri. Scroll down for video . A free man: A judge ordered Cornealious Anderson (left) out of jail today. He was arrested last year when it was discovered he was never sent to prison for a robbery conviction in a clerical mistake. Pictured above with wife LaQonna and daughter Nevaeh, 3, after his release today . Family man: When summons never came to report for jail, Anderson went on to live a life dedicated to his family. Pictured above leaving court Monday morning . Reunion: Anderson embraces his grandmother Mary Porter after being released from custody on Monday . Nightmare over: Anderson, his grandmother (left), wife LaQonna (right) and daughter Nevaeh walk down the stairs and out of court today . Judge Terry Lynn Brown lauded Anderson's 'exemplary' behavior during his 13 years of freedom before the arrest. ""You've been a good father. You've been a good husband. You've been a good taxpaying citizen of the state of Missouri. 'That leads me to believe that you are a good man and a changed man.' As the judge announced his decision, about 10 of Anderson's relatives broke out in sobs and cried. Anderson stared straight ahead but dabbed tears from his eyes. Afterward, he hugged his toddler daughter tight. The hearing lasted about 10 minutes. The judge said rather than Anderson being granted parole, he would get credit for the 4,794 days between when he was convicted and when he was arrested last year. Mistake: If he served his full sentence, Anderson would have been released last July. That's when authorities realized the clerical error and brought him to prison . Anderson's plight drew international headlines last month. An online petition on change.org includes more than 35,000 signatures urging the state to set him free. Even Attorney General Chris Koster seemed inclined to find a solution to resolve what he called a 'difficult situation.' Anderson, 37, had never been convicted of a serious crime before the robbery. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison for the holdup, then told to wait for orders that would specify when and where he was to report to prison. But the orders never came. Anderson suspected that his case had been overlooked and asked his former attorney what to do.

So Anderson went about his life, never trying to conceal his whereabouts or identity. He married, divorced, married again. He raised three children of his own and a stepchild, owned and operated three construction businesses. He coached his son's youth football team in Webster Groves, and he ran the video operation at his church. In July, Anderson's sentence was supposed to end. It was then that someone at the Missouri Department of Corrections realized he had never been put behind bars. Eight U.S. marshals arrived one morning at his home in a middle-class neighborhood and took him away. He was in prison by noon that day, and has remained behind bars ever since. The Missouri judge decided to free Anderson based on his life after his convicted. Pictured on the right his his wife LaQonna . Koster said last month that his goal was to suggest a way for the court to balance the seriousness of Anderson's crime with the clerical error made by the justice system and Anderson's conduct since the robbery. 'All three factors deserve recognition in resolving this difficult situation,' Koster said. Anderson's attorneys filed an appeal in February calling his imprisonment unfair and unjust. They had also asked Gov. Jay Nixon to commute the sentence or grant clemency.

"Real Madrid and Barcelona are the world’s most popular sports teams measured by social media followers, with each of the Spanish giants approaching 100million Facebook and Twitter fans combined. Madrid’s galaxy of stars including Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and James Rodriguez have helped them to attract almost 82m ‘fans’ on the world’s most popular social network, Facebook, plus almost 15m Twitter followers for a combined following of 96.75m across the two dominant social platforms. Barcelona’s array of talent including Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez have helped to garner them slightly more Facebook fans than Real but a few fewer Twitter followers, hence second place overall. Real Madrid are the world's most popular sports team when considering Facebook and Twitter fans . Luis Suarez, Neymar and Lionel Messi have helped Barcelona attract almost 83million Facebook likes . Although those two big clubs are way ahead of any rivals, England’s Premier League is collectively the best represented in the world’s top 10 most popular clubs. As our exclusive chart of the top 30 most popular teams shows - and Sportsmail looked at all sports sports teams across every nation, at club and international level - Premier League clubs fill five of the top 10 places. Manchester United are at No 3 in the world, followed by Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool at No 4, No 5 and No 6, and Manchester City are at No 10. United are approaching 70m Facebook likes and Twitter followers combined, well clear of Chelsea (46m) in the slot behind them. Madrid’s galaxy of stars including Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo have helped them to attract almost 15million Twitter followers . Ronaldo will no doubt have boost his club's popularity following his third Ballon d'Or success . Manchester United are at No 3 in the world with almost 70million social media fans . Jose Mourinho's Chelsea side are fourth in our list, but are some way behind Madrid and Barca . Football teams dominate the top 10 and indeed the top 30. The only non football team in the top 10 are the LA Lakers of NBA basketball at No 9. Football teams fill 17 of the 30 slots, with four of those being the national teams of Mexico (in 15th place), Brazil (16th), Germany (28th) and England (30th). There are seven NBA teams in the top 30, three teams from the NFL in America, two from Major League Baseball and one Formula One team, Mercedes. The Premier League cemented its reputation as being by far and away the most valuable league in Britain earlier this week when announcing new TV domestic deals for the 2016-19 seasons worth £5.136 billion. The only non football-team in the top 10 are the LA Lakers of NBA basketball . Lewis Hamilton's Formula One success has helped his Mercedes team to accrue more fans . But the league is also hugely popular overseas, and the global followings of the biggest teams are indicated in this survey of social media followings. This list also effectively confirms basketball - or specifically the NBA - as the second most popular global game, after football. Two Turkish clubs make the top 20 in our chart, with Galatasaray at No 13 with a combined 18.4m followers on the two platforms, and Fenerbahce in 14th place with 14.45m. Galatasaray's passionate online support mean the Turkish side are currently 13th in the top 30 list . England are one of four national teams to feature in the the top 30 most popular sports teams in the world . This shows two things; that the Turkish giants are fanatically followed at home, but also that they have worked hard for a number of years to be ‘early adopters’ of social media. Both have been at the forefront of using social media to promote themselves and expand their fanbases for several years. The country breakdown for teams in the top 30 comprises 12 teams from the USA, six from England, two each from Spain, Germany (Bayern Munich and the national football team), Turkey and Mexico (Chivas plus the national football team), and one each from Italy (Milan), Brazil (the national football team), Britain (Mercedes) and Argentina (Boca Juniors).","Real Madrid are the world's most popular sports team on social media .

"The body of a mystery man found down a well by gardeners last week was dumped there two years ago, police revealed today. The corpse is of a white man who was assaulted and bound before being thrown down the well in Warlingham, Surrey, tests have confirmed - although a cause of death could not be established. Detectives have vowed to find the killers, and a forensic team will be at the scene for another month as they hunt for clues. The well has been partly demolished and water samples taken for analysis. Scroll down for video . Probe: Police have launched a murder investigation after the body of a man was found down a well in Surrey . Grim task: Officers from the Underwater and Confined Space Search Team during the recovery operation . Aerial view of the scene: The well was 2ft wide, 7ft deep and the water was approximately 4ft deep . A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: . ‘A post mortem examination which took place on Sunday, 17 November did . not provide a cause of death and further tests are being conducted. ‘However, . the examination did reveal that the body - confirmed to be of a white . male - has sustained injuries consistent with an assault prior to being . placed in the well. Cleaned: A police specialist diver being washed down after leaving the scene . ‘It has . also been established that the body was bound up before being placed in . the well by a third party. Detectives now believe the body had been in . the well for around two years.’ He . added: ‘Officers continue to investigate the circumstances surrounding . the murder of a male whose body was discovered in a well in Warlingham. ‘Police . were called after workmen discovered the body in a well outside an . address in Audley Drive, Warlingham at around 13:50hrs on 15 November. ‘Specialist officers, including Metropolitan Police divers, attended the scene and recovered the body.’ Detective . Chief Inspector Cliff Lyons, who leads the investigation, revealed: . ‘Our enquiries continue to try and establish the identity of this male. These enquiries have included reviewing missing person reports but this . process may take some time. ‘I . would like to thank the public for their positive response to our . appeals so far and specifically those in the local community who have . been supportive throughout the disruption caused by police and media in . their neighbourhood. ‘Given . the complex nature of this investigation, it is likely that forensic . work at the property will continue for a further month as we attempt to . secure all available evidence.’ Tents: The body was found in the narrow shaft of a well outside this house on Audley Drive in Warlingham . Gardeners working at the house, set within an acre of land, spotted the body in the well in Surrey . The . investigation has so far seen the well where the body was found partly . demolished and water from within the well taken for forensic . examination. 'It . has also been established that the body was bound up before being . placed in the well by a third party. Detectives now believe the body had . been in the well for around two years' Metropolitan Police spokesman . Forensic work will continue on the well, the house and outbuildings at the property to establish as much evidence as possible. DCI . Lyons added: ‘While our work continues to establish the facts of how . this male came to sustain his injuries and his body end up in the well, . our focus is also on finding out his identity. ‘This . is someone’s son and my team owe it to him and his family to find out . the truth and bring those who committed this atrocious act to justice.’ Seven . men, aged between 21 and 27, have been arrested on suspicion of murder. They were interviewed and subsequently released on bail on Sunday until . a date in late December. The arrested men are all Polish car wash workers who live at the house. One of the men said: ‘I want to clear my name. There has been a big mistake. We don’t know nothing. We just live there.' Specialist divers, pictured, were called to the scene and were assessing how to remove the body without destroying any evidence . Evidence found by the divers at the scene indicated that the body had been placed in the well, police said . George Anastasi, owner of both the property and car wash, said he was ‘completely shocked’ when he heard of the discovery. Rory Mulholland, 21, who was working at the property with 17-year-old Jack Duncan said following the body's discovery: ‘There was quite a lot of trash in the garden. ‘I assumed whoever owned the house was clearing the house out and getting it renovated and it was the end of their tenancy. We spotted a big blue tarpaulin at the bottom of the well. ‘We were curious to see what it was. Jack turned the tarpaulin over with a length of kitchen drainpipe and then we noticed the outline of a person. ‘You could see the shape of someone’s legs and a bottom. Then we flipped the tarp over again and I saw someone’s upper thigh. It was definitely a man. I’ve never smelt anything like it.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Body found on Friday by two gardeners at house in Warlingham, Surrey .

"The headmistress of the Indian school where 23 primary school pupils were killed by lunch contaminated with pesticides is on the run, as police claim she forced a reluctant cook to serve up the food. Authorities say the cook had warned Meena Devi, head of the rural school in the eastern state of Bihar, that the cooking oil may have been contaminated. She had complained that the oil looked strange and gave off a foil smell when heated, but her concerns were dismissed. Mass tragedy: Villagers stand around the burial . mound of a child in front of the school where she was fed contaminated . food. Police said the school's head had ignored warnings from the cook about the food . 'The headmistress said ""continue cooking and serve the food to the children"",' said Police Superintendent Sujeet Kumar. Soon after the potato curry and rice was served at the school in rural Chappra, Bihar, one of India's poorest states, pupils started complaining of stomach cramps, then began to vomit and collapse. Ninety minutes later, the first victim died on the way to hospital. Death came so quickly for some that they died in their parents' arms while being taken to hospital. Dozens of other children are being treated for food poisoning. Authorities discovered a container of pesticide in the school's cooking area next to the vegetable oil and mustard oil, but it wasn't yet known if that container was the source, said Amarjeet Sinha, a top official in Bihar. 'It's not a case of food poisoning. It's a case of poison in food in a large quantity, going by the instant deaths,' Mr Sinha said. Grief: Women mourn the death of their children who died after consuming the contaminated meals . Family members of a school girl (not pictured) mourn her death: Twenty-three youngsters died after eating the food, and dozens more remain in hospital after suffering sever poisoning . More answers are expected on Friday, when a forensic laboratory is to issue the results of its tests on the dead children, the food and the uncooked grain stored by the headmistress in her house, he said. Police were searching for the principal, who fled after the students started falling sick, Sinha said. The cooks, Manju Devi and Pano Devi, told The Associated Press that the principal controlled the food for the free daily lunch provided by the government at the school. She gave them rice, potatoes, soy and other ingredients needed to prepare the meal for Tuesday lunchtime and then went about her business. As the children ate, they started fainting, the cooks said. Villagers stand next to mass graves of the schoolchildren who died: Authorities discovered a container of pesticide in the school's cooking area next to the vegetable oil and mustard oil . A villager walks past the graves: A forensic laboratory carried out tests  on the dead children, the food and the uncooked grain stored by the teacher in her house . The clothes and shoes of a victim, placed by her family members on her grave: Post-mortem reports on the children who died have confirmed that insecticide was either in the food or cooking oil . Abandoned: A villager looks back towards the locked house of the headmistress of a school, who fled with her family after children started dying. The cooks said that the teacher controlled the food for the free daily lunch . The two cooks were not spared either. Local farmer Ajay Kumar's 5-year-old daughter was among the victims. He was in his house, which is about 100 metres from the school, when he heard screams from neighbours saying the children had fallen ill. 'I rushed there and all the kids were on their backs or clutching their stomachs or vomiting. I picked up my girl and took her to the local hospital right away,' Ajay said. Parents hitched rides or took public transport to get to the hospital, which is about nine miles from the village, he said. Medical staff told them they had no medicines to give them. His daughter died shortly afterwards, writhing in pain on the floor. When Reuters visited the village, there were at least 18 burial mounds, many in a large field opposite the school. Some contained multiple bodies and villagers could not agree on how many children were buried in them. Many parents said they buried their children's toys and clothes in the graves. Manju Devi, 30, ate some of the food and fainted. Her three children, ages five, eight and 13, fell ill as well. All were in stable condition Thursday. While Pano Devi, 35, didn't eat the tainted food, her three children did. Two of them died and the third, a four-year-old daughter, was in the hospital. 'I will stop cooking at the school,' she said. 'I am so horrified that I wouldn't grieve more if my only surviving child died.' Mr Sinha said one of the cooks told authorities that the cooking oil appeared different than usual, but the principal told her to use it anyway. Doctors treating the children said they suspected the food had been contaminated with insecticide. Media reports said the cooking oil may have been stored in an old pesticide container, but there was no independent confirmation of this. 'The minute the children were brought in, we smelled this foul odour of organophosphorus,' said Dr. Vinod Mishra, a doctor in the medical team treating many of the children at Patna Medical College Hospital in Bihar's capital, Patna. Organophosphorus compounds are used as pesticides, which are widely available and are sold under a variety of different brands. Dozens sick: Schoolchildren receive treatment at a hospital after falling ill soon after eating free school meals . Treatment: The meal was cooked in the school kitchen, but school authorities stopped serving it as children started vomiting . The free midday meal was served to the . children Tuesday in Gandamal village in Masrakh block, 50 miles north . of Patna, the Bihar state capital. Those . who survived the poison were unlikely to suffer from any serious after . effects from the tainted food, said Patna Medical College hospital . superintendent Amarkant Jha Amar. 'There . will be no remnant effects on them. The effects of poisoning will be . washed after a certain period of time from the tissues,' Mr Amar said. He . said that the post-mortem reports on the children who died confirmed . that insecticide was either in the food or cooking oil. He said . authorities were waiting for lab results for more details on the . chemicals. Horror: A father mourns as he holds his dead daughter today inside an ambulance, outside a hospital in Patna, in the eastern Indian state of Bihar . Location: It was not immediately clear how chemicals ended up in the food in a school in Masrakh, near Patna in Bihar, although one official said the food may not have been properly washed before it was cooked . India's midday . meal plan is one of the world's biggest school nutrition programs. State . governments have the freedom to decide on menus and timings of the . meals, depending on local conditions and availability of food rations. It . was first introduced in the Sixties in southern India, where it was . seen as an incentive for poor parents to send their children to school. Since . then, the program has spread across the country, covering some . 120million schoolchildren. It's part of an effort to address concerns . about malnutrition, which the government says nearly half of all Indian . children suffer from.

"Manchester United have received a major boost in their efforts to sign Oscar Borg after the highly-rated youngster rejected a contract at West Ham. The winger has been on trial with the Old Trafford club over the last couple of weeks, playing in a friendly game for the Under 18 side against Trafford last week. He has also travelled with United’s youngsters to compete in the Milk Cup in Ireland, starting both of the club’s games so far. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Oscar Borg showing why he's been dubbed the new Gareth Bale . One to watch: Manchester United are keen to sign Oscar Borg after he rejected a contract at West Ham . In good company: Borg has been compared to Real Madrid winger Gareth Bale . Sportsmail understands that he has turned down the opportunity to sign professional terms with east London club and favours a move to United. There is also considerable interest from other clubs, however. Borg, a left-sided winger or full-back has been compared to Gareth Bale due to his floppy hairstyle and direct approach down the left-flank. He would be available for just a nominal fee, thought to be in the region of a £250,000 in compensation as he has not been signed up a scholar, despite emerging through the club’s famed academy system. Future stars: Manchester United have won their first two games at the Milk Cup . The 16-year-old completed his GCSE’s at the John Fisher School in Surrey this summer and is now understood to be considering a life-changing move to Manchester. West Ham confirmed that Borg is training at United with the club’s knowledge but declined to comment on his contract situation.

"A young Norwegian woman has been sentenced to 16 months in jail after she reported a rape in Dubai. The 25-year-old was in the United Arab Emirates on a business trip when she was raped and reported the assault to the local police. Dubai police did not believe her, and instead took her passport and jailed her on suspicion of having had sex outside marriage. Sentenced: The 25 year old Norwegian woman was raped on a business trip and thrown in a Dubai jail . The Norwegian woman reported the sexual assault in March this year, after which she had to spend days in a cell before she was allowed to use a telephone. With the help of family members, the Norwegian consulate was able to negotiate a release and she has been living under the protection of the Norwegian Sailor’s Church until her sentencing this week. 'I received the harshest sentence for sex outside marriage, harshest sentence for drinking alcohol and on top of that I was found guilty of perjury,’ the woman told Verdens Gang. ‘It is a terrible situation she is in,’ said Gisle Meling, the priest at the Norwegian Sailor’s Church. ‘We are very surprised and had hoped it would go another way, but we live in a country which has a justice system which draws its conclusions with the help of Sharia law.’ Dark side: Having been detained in Dubai since the assault in March, Ms  Dalelv has now been found guilty of sex outside marriage, drinking alcohol without a licence and perjury and was jailed for 16 months . She was sentenced to one year and four months in jail but as Norway has no extradition treaty with Dubai, her future is uncertain. The young Norwegian woman's story is not unique. Earlier this year Australian Alicia Gali, 27, spoke of how she was thrown in a Dubai jail for eight months after she reported a rape. Miss Gali was working at hotel chain Starwood when her drink was spiked in the staff bar. She awoke to find that three colleagues had raped her, but when she went to a hospital for help, they turned her over to the police and she was charged with illicit sex outside marriage. Under UAE law, rapists can only be convicted if either the perpetrator confesses or if four adult Muslim males witness the crime. Under the Sharia-influenced laws, sex before marriage is completely forbidden and an unmarried couple holding hands in public can be jailed. Foreigners jailed in Dubai are deported immediately after completing their sentences.","Norwegian woman, 25, was in Dubai on a business trip .

"A Chinese man has reportedly fallen into a coma after suffering an electric shock as he plugged in his iPhone 4 to charge - less than a week after a bride-to-be died answering her Apple smartphone. Wu Jiantong collapsed at around 10pm on Monday after connecting his iPhone 4 to a charger at home in Beijing. He'd had the phone for two years. 'He shouted 'electric shock' and then fell to the floor,' Wu's sister told Xinhua news agency, adding that she felt a slight shock herself when she tried to unplug the faulty charger, which she said was not official Apple hardware. An Apple spokesman said: 'It was with great sadness we learned through press reports that a Beijing customer was injured while using a ""knock off"" or counterfeit charger and we are looking into this further. 'Our customers' safety is very important to us and we have carefully designed all Apple products to meet government safety standards. We recommend our customers only purchase Apple products from Apple or authorized Apple resellers.' It comes a week after an air . stewardess was killed by an electric shock when she answered a call on . her iPhone 5 while it was recharging on a wet third-party charger. Grief: Wu's sister, left, cries as she waits for news in the hospital in Beijing next to the phone which was said to have electrocuted him through a faulty, third-party charger, right . News of the death of Ma Ailun, 23, was . posted on the internet by her sister, prompting criticism of Apple . among the country’s millions of iPhone users. ‘I want to warn everyone else not to make phone calls when your mobile phone is recharging,’ her sister wrote. Miss Ma, who was due to marry in . August, was said to have bought her iPhone 5 in December from an . official store in her home town in Xinjiang province. Her  brother told a Hong Kong newspaper the phone had been handed to Chinese authorities for examination. There were also safety warnings about . the millions of cheap copycat phones and chargers on the market. Apple . products sell out quickly in China, the demand fuelling the factories . churning out fake iPhones, iPads and iPods. In 2011, 22 fake Apple stores were uncovered in one Chinese city, Kunming, alone. Apple promised to investigate the death – a blow for the technology company in its second largest market after the US. It declined to say if it was investigating an isolated case or if it was considering a product recall. The safety scare is the latest incident to blight the company’s reputation in China. In April, Apple apologised to Chinese . consumers and changed iPhone warranty policies, following criticism of . its after-sales service. Two years ago conditions at some of the factories making Apple products were blamed for a spate of  worker suicides. Miss Ma's brother, Yuelun, told Apple . Daily that the family believe she died from an electric shock while . answering a call and that the phone and its accessories have been handed . over to the Chinese authorities.

Celebration: Greg Parker leaves the Apple Store on 5th Avenue after buying the new Apple iPhone 5 in September . Jubilant: An employee riles up his coworkers outside the Fifth Avenue store to celebrate the new gadget . Her sister then wrote on social networking site Weibo: 'I want to warn everyone else not to make phone calls when your mobile phone is recharging.' She said Ma had bought the iPhone in December at an official Apple store . and was using the original charger to recharge the phone when the . incident occurred. Apple, said it had launched a 'thorough . investigation', adding: 'We are deeply saddened to learn of this tragic . incident and offer our condolences to the family. Apple's mobile gadgets have a generally good safety record with few serious defects reported since the first generation iPhone was launched in 2007. However, as smartphones become more powerful, with larger batteries needing more electricity to power them, there have been growing reports of dangerous malfunctions that have dogged the firm in recent years. February 2013 - Marketing manager Shibani Bhujle, from New York, claimed the battery of her iPhone 4S spontaneously melted, oozing acid that destroyed the handset. January 2013 - An Oregon fire crew blamed an apartment blaze on an overheated MacBook battery which dropped onto a mattress. December 2011 - An iPhone 4 reportedly began . emitting smoke in a plane cabin on a flight to Australia. December 2011 - It was reported that an iPhone 4 was . plugged in to charge overnight in Brazil when it began to emit smoke and sparks as . its owner slept nearby. November 2011 - Apple recalled all . iPod Nanos amid fears the batteries on older models were prone to . overheating and catching fire. In 2010, a man in northeast China . was killed by an electric shock when making a phone call with a handset . that was being recharged with an unauthorized charger, according to the . China Consumers Association. In 2008 a . 3G owner claimed his phone overheated in his pocket and burned his leg . while he was asleep. But Apple is not the only smartphone maker to have come under fire for faulty gadgets. Just last week, a Swiss teenager suffered second and third degree burns when her Samsung Galaxy S3 apparently exploded in her pocket. In May, a Reddit user posted pictures on the site of his charred Galaxy S3, claiming he was 'awoken by a loud noise and a . weird squeaking sound' to find it smouldering by the side of his bed. 'We will fully investigate and co-operate with authorities in this matter.' China’s popular social media chat . sites, called Weibos, were flooded with posts urging fellow iPhone users . not to make calls while charging their phones. And many warned to only use original chargers and avoid plugging in cheap copy chargers which are widely available. 'Be sure to select only qualified, certifiable  products -  the best is the original because safety is most assured. Don’t buy fake chargers!' warned poster Zhao Chao. Apple products are  popular in China but new items are quickly cloned by the country’s infamous copy merchants who produce look-a-like fake phones, laptops, iPads and iPods, which are often hard to distinguish from originals. Mobile phones have a relatively low . electrical output of between 3 to 5 volts - much less than the 36 volts . it takes for a person to feel a shock. But experts say if the charger or the circuit has a problem, such as a broken wire, it can lead to a shock of 220 volts. Johnny Sin Kin-on, a professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, told the South China Morning Post: 'There is a risk using an electrical device while its installed battery is being charged, be it a shaver or a phone.' The iPhone 5's much-vaunted launch . last September saw thousands of Apple fans queue for days outside Apple . stores across the world to be the first to get their hands on the . state-of-the-art gadget. Grinning customers were greeted with . cheers and high fives from staff as they walked into stores ready to . grab the latest hotly-anticipated smartphone. It costs between £529 and £699 in the UK and $199 and $399 in the US, depending on the amount of memory, has a . larger screen and is lighter and slimmer than previous models. The news comes as it was revealed today that Apple has fallen off the top ten list of best-perceived brands . in 2013. The tech firm - known for its trailblazing innovation - lost its charismatic front man Steve . Jobs in 2011 and then faced a chorus of disapproval over allegations of child . labor in its supply chain, not to mention long-reported harsh conditions . in its Chinese factories. Most recently, the brand was convicted on . Wednesday of conspiring to raise and fix the price of e-books in an . attempt to dominate the market leader, Amazon.

"Six of the children killed in the shooting massacre at Sandy Hook school were gunned down as they made a brave escape attempt, it emerged today. The first-graders had been hidden in a closet by teacher Victoria Soto when the first gunshots rang out at the elementary School in Newtown on Friday morning. When the gunman entered the classroom looking for the children, he came face-to-face with 27-year-old Miss Soto who tried to throw him off by saying the children were in the auditorium at the other end of the building. However six of the children then tried to run from their hiding place and were shot dead by the gunman. Miss Soto and a teacher's aide were also killed. Scroll down for video . Courageous: Jesse Lewis, six, broke free from his hiding place when the gunman burst into his classroom but was gunned down. His teacher Victoria Soto (right) was shot dead protecting her students . The remaining seven petrified first-graders were later found in the closet by first responders at the Connecticut school. Neil Heslin told the New York Post that his son Jesse Lewis was one of the children who tried to make a run for it. Mr Heslin said: 'I wish my kid stayed put. But that’s Jesse. I can see him making that choice and just doing something. My boy died the way I would have died if I was in that position.' He added: 'Jesse grew up on a farm. He’s tough. That would be my little guy to try to get out of there.' Miss Soto had worked at Sandy Hook Elementary for five years. Soto was a highly regarded young teacher who was popular with her pupils. One young student, Jacob . Riley, told MailOnline that Soto was known for chewing gum in class - something not . usually allowed for teachers. He said he had often teased her about her . habit and she had playfully teased him back. Selfless: Victoria Soto, 27, had tried to get the gunman out of her classroom by saying the children were at the auditorium at the other end of the building . 'She . took her kids, put them in the closet and by doing so she lost her life . protecting those little ones,' Soto's cousin, Jim Wiltsie, told ABC News. 'She was found huddled over her . children, her students, doing instinctively what she knew was the right . thing. I'm just proud that Vicki had the instincts to protect her kids from harm,' he continued. 'It brings peace to know that Vicki was doing what she loved, protecting the children and in our eyes she's a hero,' he added. A deeply distraught 10-year-old boy who is a former student of Miss Soto described her as 'really nice and funny.' Four teachers were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School . trying to save their students from gunman Adam Lanza. The other three teachers have been identified as principal . Dawn Hochsprung, 47, school psychologist Mary Sherlach, 56, and Lauren Rousseau, 30. Devastated friends of Rousseau said she was having 'the best year of her life' after landing her first full-time teaching job only months ago. Twenty-eight . people died in the shooting rampage, including 20 young children, the gunman who took . his own life and his mother Nancy Lanza, who was shot before the school massacre. When . Lanza started firing at the school in suburban Newtown, Connecticut, . some teachers dove under tables - but Mrs Hochsprung and Mrs Sherlach didn't hesitate. Hero: Vicki Soto, 27, was trying to shield her first grade students from the gunman when she was shot . Murderer: Adam Lanza, killed himself after murdering more than two dozen others, including 20 school children . They ran into the hallway to confront the danger and were murdered execution-style as a result. Diane Day, a school therapist, told the Wall Street Journal that she and several other teachers were in a meeting with Mrs Hochsprung and Mrs Sherlach when the shooting began. 'We were there for about five minutes chatting and we heard, ""pop pop pop,""' she said. 'I went under the table.' The . principal and the school psychologist had other ideas. They jumped out . of their seats and ran toward the sound of the gunfire. 'They didn’t think twice about confronting or seeing what was going on,' Ms Day added. Rabbi Shaul Praver told MSNBC that Mrs Hochsprung and Mrs Sherlach were killed execution-style. Tributes for all educators poured in on Friday night. Former school superintendent John Reed told the Connecticut Post that Mrs Sherlach was warm and cared deeply for her students. 'If . there ever was a person, by qualifications and personality, to work . with children, to be a school psychologist, it was Mary,' he said. She . was married with two grown daughters in their 20s and enjoyed . gardening, reading and the theater, according to her school biography.

Devastation: Sandy Hook Elementary School, home to 700 students, was attacked by a crazed gunman on Friday . Friends and neighbors said it was immediately clear to everyone she knew that she loved her students and her school. 'I don’t think you could find a more positive place to bring students to every day,' she had recently told a local newspaper. Another tale of heroism came from an eight-year-old student who said a teacher pulled him from the hallway as bullets rang out. 'I saw some of the bullets going down the hall that I was right next to and then a teacher pulled me into her classroom,' the boy told CBS News. 'It sounded like someone was kicking a door,' he said of the piercing sound of the gunfire. His relieved mother agreed, saying that the teacher saved her son's life.","Six children tried to escape and were shot dead; the seven who stayed in hiding survived .

"A New York woman has told how she got a piece of platinum jewelry inserted in her eye to set herself apart from the crowd even though the American Academy of Ophthalmology warns against the procedure. Kristina Kovalevskya is the first New Yorker to visit Dr Emil Chynn at Park Avenue Laser Vision to get a 'cute' heart-shaped sequin, measuring 3.5mm, placed on the white of her of right eye ball. 'I’m a person who likes . extremes...I want to keep it in my eye as long as possible. I like it, . but I’m planning to swap it out. I really want to try a new design. Every girl wants to try something new,' she told Blackbook. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Kristina Kovalevskaya is the first woman in New York to have a platinum heart embedded in her eye . A platinum heart seen surgically embedded in Kristina Kovalevskaya's right eye . According to Harvard and NYU-trained Dr Chynn the eye jewelry procedure has been done hundreds of times in Europe and in Los Angeles, but never before in New York. Ms Kovalevskaya was one of his first clients. To start the process he injected anesthetic into her eye to numb the area. Then he made a small incision to make room for the piece of jewelry. “The procedure involves making a very tiny incision in the clear covering of the eye, or skin of the eye,' Dr. Chynn explained. 'The platinum is then inserted. I don’t have to suture it up because it’s so small and it just closes up after three days.' Using forceps he positioned the tiny flat stud into position on Ms Kovalevskaya's eye membrane. She wanted it set pointing diagonally. Minutes later she was handed a mirror to admire her new accessory and given the go-ahead to go home. The doctor holds his patient's eyes open with forceps . The doctor makes a tiny incision and divides the pocket between the sclera and the white of the eye before straightening the heart with forceps . Though it may sound scary, Dr Chynn insists the procedure, which was invented by a Dutch eye surgeon and introduced in 2004, is actually pretty safe. 'It's . a very thin piece of platinum that's designed for insertion on the top . of the eye, it's not in the eye so there's no risk of blindness or . anything at all,' he says. 'She . could have a little bit of local bleeding. That could go away in a . couple days or couple weeks. She could have an infection but we'll . prevent that with antibiotics.' But the jewelry has not been FDA approved and the American Academy of Ophthalmology is warning consumers about the dangers. The procedure may seem simple but requires special preparation by the doctor . Going under the knife, especially on the eyeball, can pose substantial health risks such as bleeding and infection . In a statement to Fox 5, the medical body said there is not 'sufficient evidence to support the safety or therapeutic value of this procedure.' It urges consumers to 'avoid placing in the eye any foreign body or material that is not approved by the FDA.' Wayne Bizer, D.O., a comprehensive ophthalmologist from Ft. Lauderdale, Florida previously warned: 'My concern would be that it might cause foreign body granuloma or scar tissue. 'The implant could also allow bacteria to . get beneath the conjunctiva causing a serious vision-threatening . infection or possibly erode the sclera, the white part of the eye.' Kovalevskaya is the first woman is New York to have the procedure done . Kristina Kovalevskaya checks out the platinum hearts embedded in her eyes as Dr Emil Chynn looks on on . Kovalevskaya decide too get a heart in her eye because she says, 'I'm already a star.' And if she gets bored of her heart-shaped implant it can be swapped it for something different. 'You can switch from a star for Christmas, for example,' Dr Chynn states on his website, adding that each swap incurs a $1,000 fee. In addition to putting hearts in women's eyes Dr. Chynn has been contestant on The Millionaire . Kovalevskya loves her new eye bling and Dr.Chynn hopes to find love on Millionaire matchmaker .

"One of Portland's trendiest areas might soon be home to a tent city. If this were another town, the owners and developers of high-end homes and condominiums would scream to high heaven about diminished property values. But this is Portland, where the citizens try their best to be tolerant of everything except intolerance - and gluten. Protesting: Developers and some residents are angry at plans to move the Right 2 Dream Too homeless camp in Portland, Oregon, to a parking lot under the west ramp of the Broadway Bridge . Opponents of a city plan to put 100 people under a century-old bridge in the Pearl District are carefully choosing their words when complaining about the prospect of new, down-on-their-luck neighbors. Rather than express concern for their financial investments, they have criticized the city's expedited process and worried for the welfare of those willing to live in a parking lot under the west ramp of the Broadway Bridge. Tiffany Sweitzer, the president of Hoyt Street Properties, a realty and development firm that - over the course of 15 years - has helped transform a dying industrial area into a sparkling urban neighborhood, said 'throwing a bunch of people under a bridge' should not be the city's solution to helping the estimated 2,000 residents who sleep outside each night. 'It's embarrassing, because that is not how you would treat anybody,' she said. Mayor Charlie Hales and city commissioners plan to decide October 16 whether to move the camp to the Pearl District from its current home near the entrance to Chinatown. If approved, a coalition of property owners promises to sue. The camp known as Right 2 Dream Too (R2D2) was established in October 2011 during the Occupy Portland movement. Four years earlier, the city forced an adult bookstore to close because of code violations. The building was later demolished and the lot remained empty for three years until the aggrieved owner allowed the homeless to lease the property for $1 a year. Each night for two years, roughly 100 people have slept on prime downtown real estate - in tents shielded from passers-by with a barrier of old, colorful doors fashioned into an artsy wall. During that time, landowner Michael Wright racked up more than $20,000 in fines because of violations associated with operating a campsite without a permit. He responded with a lawsuit. Tent City: The Right 2 Dream Too homeless camp is currently next to the Chinatown gate in Portland . To extract Portland from this mess, city Commissioner Amanda Fritz brokered a deal in which the fines would be waived, the lawsuit dropped and the homeless campers sent to the Pearl District. It all happened in a matter of weeks, angering homeowners and developers who say the city was so desperate to settle Wright's lawsuit that it bypassed zoning laws. Fritz, a former psychiatric nurse, acknowledged that the camp is not the ideal answer to homelessness. She said there is not enough money to provide housing to all, and R2D2 has provided a much safer alternative than the street. 'It's been an option that's been better than nothing,' she said. Scores of people spoke for and against the proposal at a recent five-hour hearing. Though some older women testified their safety would be jeopardized, most Pearl District residents completely ignored quality-of-life and financial issues and repeatedly griped that the city did the deal in secret and delegitimized the zoning code. Not everyone in the neighborhood is rich, they added, and the fight has been unfairly cast as the greedy against the homeless, or 'us against them.' 'It's a sad, confrontational, divisive atmosphere because communication was intentionally closed,' said Julie Young, a retired social worker who lives in the Pearl. Besides condominiums and the low-income apartments for older residents, there are businesses nearby and a Marriott is scheduled to open next year. Those who have spoken to the potential financial impact of R2D2 say hotel guests won't want to stay near a shantytown and commercial rents could fall by more than 15 percent. Home: The camp was established in October 2011 during the Occupy Portland movement and is home to about 100 people . Ziba Design spent $20 million to build its headquarters in the Pearl District. Its real estate adviser, Greg Close of Wyse Investment Services, said in a phone interview that his client represents a large Chinese apparel manufacturer that is considering Portland. 'What does my client tell the executive of that manufacturer when it asks: 'How can we trust you, Ziba, with our brand when we come to Portland and see you invested $20 million next to a homeless camp?' ' Homeless people, meanwhile, ask their prospective neighbors to give them a chance. R2D2 has an excellent safety record, and supporters say the camp - they call it a rest area - has helped people get back on their feet and into permanent housing. 'We're not there to bring property values down,' said Ibrahim Mubarak, the R2D2 leader. 'We're there to get people from sleeping on your sidewalk. We're there to stop people from sleeping in the doorways. We're there to stop the drug dealing; we're there to stop the drug use by our friends.'","Developers and residents protesting plan to move homeless 'tent city' into trendy Portland area .

"George Lucas has spent £9million on buying and restoring an Italian convent. Although the Star Wars director bought the property in 2009, the purchase has only just become public. The inhabitants of Passignano sul Trasimeno, in Umbria in central Italy, kept Lucas's presence a secret until last week. Tucked away: George Lucas's villa is all but hidden from view in Passignano sul Trasimeno, Italy . George Lucas: The Star Wars director kept his Italian holiday home secret for two years . The Hollywood legend's new home was built in the 16th century as a Capuchin convent, and occupied by monks until 1966. By the time Lucas bought the property, it was worth £5.2million. He has spent several millions more on renovating the buildings, with only the 13th century church remaining unchanged. Renovations included a billiards room, swimming pool and even a spa. He is believed to have invited some of his Hollywood friends round for a tour a few weeks ago: Robert De Niro, Steven Spielberg, Ron Howard and Francis Ford Coppola all stayed together at the convent. While they were there, Lucas showed . them his latest film - a documentary about the property's restoration, . screened in the building's new cinema. Locals . are reluctant to talk about Lucas, who rarely ventures outside his . grounds, barring an occasional walk on the shore of Lake Trasimeno, . which is overlooked by the town. Passignano: Lucas's new home overlooks Lake Trasimeno, where he can sometimes be seen walking with bodyguards . However, they did reveal that the . director and his wife sometimes order enormous quantities of ice cream . from the village, to cater for parties. 'For . us it means work,' said one Passignano resident to an Italian . newspaper. 'The presence of these gentlemen is useful to the community.' The mayor of the village, Claudio Bellaveglia, was more forthcoming, according to the Sunday Times. 'We respected his wish,' he said. 'If we'd betrayed him, we'd have behaved like provincials.' The . mayor added that he had been invited to the convent for the first time . since his childhood, and was particularly impressed by Lucas' cinema. The next Lucas production to hit the big screen will be Red Tails, scheduled for a release next year. It tells the story of the Tuskegee Airmen, the first group of African-American pilots to fly in combat squadron during World War Two.

"It is an issue that arouses high emotions. But the Archbishop of Canterbury’s opposition to gay marriage provoked a response from a fellow man of the cloth that was anything but holy. Not only that, the outburst was recorded on Facebook for all to see. So outraged was the Rev Marcus Ramshaw after Justin Welby spoke in the House of Lords against the proposed same-sex marriage law that he condemned him on the social networking site as a ‘w*****’. Row: Rev Marcus Ramshaw (left) turned on the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and called him a 'w****r' after he spoke against gay marriage in the House of Lords (right) this week . Row: Rev Ramshaw called on the Archbishop to resign and called him a w****r in this post on Facebook . He also went further, describing the choice of Archbishop Welby to lead the Church of England as a ‘massive mistake’. The church has since admonished him – by leaving another Facebook message under his original posting. On Monday Archbishop Welby said the . Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill would effectively abolish the . traditional institution of marriage, which he said was a cornerstone of . society. He said it would create ‘different and unequal’ forms of marriage. In response Mr Ramshaw, who like the . Archbishop trained for the priesthood at Cranmer Hall, Durham, called . for a petition urging him to resign. He wrote: ‘What really upsets me is . nasty people such as Justin Welby robbing me of my faith in the church, . he does not speak in my name and I think he is a w*****, but I’m not . going to stop being a Christian or a priest.’ Rant: Rev Ramshaw then called for a petition to force Welby out of the job at the top of the Church . The posting came to the attention of church officials, one of whom admonished Mr Ramshaw in a follow-up posting. The Rev Arun Arora, director of . communications at the church’s headquarters in Westminster, wrote: . ‘Clearly you are upset with the political stance of the C of E . leadership. Defence: Justin Welby was defended by his PR team who said: 'Whilst I am sure this will be water off a duck's back for Archbishop Justin, I don't think calling someone a w***** is the best way of engaging' 'However that is no justification for your language and . vitriol. Calling another Christian a w***** doesn’t work for me as a . priestly response. ‘I hope you might find time to reconsider the expression of your anger and delete some of these posts.’ Mr Ramshaw replied: ‘I will. I don’t . know you at all but I see you are director of comms, please specify . exactly what you wish me to withdraw and I will oblige.’ Mr Arora responded: ‘How about removing the line about Justin “a w*****”?’ He later added: ‘Any right minded person would find a priest calling his archbishop an onanist to be utterly outrageous.’ Mr Ramshaw, who is not currently . licensed to officiate because he is a full-time carer, said later: ‘Why . is the church, after the whole women bishops debacle, now excluding . people who actually want to get married? ‘I suspect many bishops, clergy and laity support gay marriage but we do not have a vote.’ Last night Mr Arora said: ‘The issue . of same-sex marriage is an emotive one. 'There are a variety of views . within the Church and much of that debate takes place online. ‘While I am sure this will be water . off a duck’s back for Archbishop Justin, I think it was right to . challenge Marcus’s approach.’ The Bill passed the Lords on Tuesday . by a voting ratio of 2-1.

"Dr Mirza Tariq Ali, 39, who fled the country after being charged with violent disorder  has become a senior leader of the Taliban in Pakistan . A British surgeon who fled the country after being charged with violent disorder during an extremist rally has become a senior leader of the Taliban in Pakistan, it has been claimed. Dr Mirza Tariq Ali, 39, who practised on the NHS, has appeared in a chilling recruitment video for the terrorist organisation, urging foreign jihadists to join him. He has also edited an online English-language jihadist magazine, called 'Ihya-e-Khilafat', Revival of the Islamic Caliphate, aimed at recruiting Muslim youths from the West. The surgeon was convicted in the first-ever successful prosecution for Islamic sectarian violence in Britain after he was seen hitting a bystander over the head with a pole at a Central London rally in 2013. But he skipped bail and was found guilty in his absence at the Old Bailey and sentenced to 15 months. He was then struck off by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) after a hearing in Manchester. It was previously reported that he was fighting as a jihadi in Syria. But it has now emerged that he has become a mouthpiece for a Taliban splinter-group under a new name - Dr Abu Obaidah Al-Islamabadi, according to the Sunday Telegraph. Wearing a black turban, he was seen in a video clip, saying: 'Allah blessed me with the passion of Jihad. I left Britain with an intention to go to Iraq and join Islamic State, but I was arrested on the way and sent to prison in Croatia.' The extremist magazine which he helps to edit publishes contact details for  potential jihadi youths and advises them not to use  home computers which might be tracked by intelligence agencies. In one article, Dr Tariq Ali said: 'The Muslims of Pakistan should support only those Mujahideen who are fighting to implement Shariah in Pakistan and striving to make this land a part of emerging global Khilafat (Caliphate). The NHS surgeon (left) has appeared in a chilling recruitment video for the terrorist organisation, urging foreign jihadists to join him, alongside an editor of an extremist magazine (right) 'Muslims of Pakistan should save themselves from the trap of the secular government which claims to be a Muslim [government] but keeps benefiting from its alliance with Kuffar (Infidels). 'The Muslims of Pakistan should also be aware of the misguided religious politicians who continue to paint democracy as Islamic.' In a recent interview he revealed he was captured on his way to join the Islamic State led by Abu-Baker Al-Baghdadi in Iraq. Dr Tariq Ali has edited an online English-language jihadist magazine, called 'Ihya-e-Khilafat', Revival of the Islamic Caliphate, aimed at recruiting Muslim youths from the West . It is not clear where he was when he was captured, but he revealed he was jailed in Croatia. After his release from Croatia, Dr Tariq Ali reached Pakistan and joined the Movement of Pakistani Taliban led by Omar Khalid Khorasani. He worked as a doctor in the Pakistani army before arriving in Britain in 2004. The extremist then trained at a London teaching hospital and worked shifts in the capital and Cambridge. While based in the UK he was associated with pro-jihadist groups led by leading British Islamist Anjem Choudary. Police and security services are now facing embarrassing questions over how he was able to skip his bail. He was held twice by police and in November last year was briefly imprisoned for breaching his bail before evading the Metropolitan Police and MI5 and travelling abroad. Another terrorist suspect believed to have been planning a suicide bomb plot abroad fled the UK in recent months in the back of a lorry despite having his passport seized. The 26-year-old, of Somali origin, had known associations with terror organisations dating back to 2008 and lived a few streets away from Ed Miliband. David Cameron has pledged to prevent British jihadists from returning by cancelling their passports for two years. But the case of Dr Tariq Ali highlights the damage that can be caused by extremists who evade the British justice system.","Dr Mirza Tariq Ali has become a senior leader of the Taliban in Pakistan .

"Electronic cigarettes contain carcinogenic chemicals that make some as harmful as normal tobacco, a new French study has claimed. The report comes after government plans announced in May this year to ban electronic cigarettes from public places in France. Now monthly magazine 60 Millions Consommateurs (60 Million Consumers) has branded the devices as 'far from the harmless gadgets they're sold as by manufacturers'. Electronic cigarettes contain carcinogenic chemicals that make some as harmful as normal tobacco, a new French study has claimed . The magazine - which reports the findings of the National Consumers' Institute - said it tested ten different rechargable and disposable models for carcenogenic and toxic properties. Editor Thomas Laurenceau wrote: 'We detected a significant quantity of carcinogenic molecules in the vapour of these cigarettes which have thus far gone undetected. 'In three models out of ten the levels of the carcinogenic compound formaldehyde come close to those of a conventional cigarette. 'The highly toxic molecule acrolein was also detected in the vapours of e-cigarettes, sometimes at levels even higher than in traditional cigarettes.' The report also criticised certain models for lacking child-proof safety caps because nicotine levels contained in the liquid content of an electronic cigarette could be lethal to children. Mr Laurenceau added: 'It's not a reason to ban them, but a good reason to control them.' Toxic levels of various molecules were found in some of the e-cigarettes meaning they could be just as dangerous as traditional cigarettes. Image shows lung cancer cells . French Health Minister Marisol Touraine announced in May that the ban on smoking in public places would be extended to cover electronic cigarettes, and that they would be subject to the same controls as tobacco. The move has sparked outrage among sellers and users of the battery-powered devices which contain liquid nicotine that is turned into a vapor when inhaled. Ms Touraine said: 'The e-cigarette is not an ordinary product. 'We need to apply the same measures as there are for tobacco. 'That means making sure it cannot be smoked in public places, that its sale is restricted to over 18s and that firms are not allowed to advertise the products.' E-cigarettes are currently legal to use in bars and restaurants and all other public places, where traditional smoking has been banned for five years. A ban would harm the booming e-cigarette industry in France, where around one million people now use the gadgets, vendors insist. Darren Moon, the English owner of online store Vapshop.fr, said: 'If they ban it in public or in the workplace, I'll be closing my store, or moving it somewhere where there aren't restrictions like that. 'Twenty percent of our business is selling disposable e-cigarettes to restaurants, clubs, bars and hotels. So if there's a workplace ban, I'd have to start firing people.' E-cigarettes were first invented in China in 2003, as many nations began imposing bans on smoking, and are aimed at giving the user a similar sensation to smoking a cigarette. In March this year, health expert Professor Bertrand Dauzenberg told France's Europe 1 radio that e-cigarettes could have the opposite effect that is designed for. He added: 'These electronic cigarettes could also lead children to start smoking and sale should be banned to minors. 'However for heavy smokers, I believe these will reduce the health risks, but the best way to quit smoking is the patch or chewing gum.'","Findings from the National Consumers' Institute said it tested ten .

"Chinese authorities have exposed some of the 007-style gadgets that students have been caught using to try and cheat their way through tough university entrance exams. Security staff in Jinlin, Jiangsu and Guangdong provinces have revealed students are using sophisticated radio vests in order to receive help from someone outside the hall. Pupils take pictures of the tests using a button-hole camera hidden in a pen or watch, then use a copper antenna loop stitched into their clothing to beam it out of the hall to someone sitting with a receiver. Chinese authorities have revealed techniques used by pupils to cheat tough university entrance exams. This system uses a copper antenna (top) to beam images out of the exam hall, then a cheap mobile connected to a hidden earpiece (bottom right) to get answers back, with batteries to power the ensemble (left) Students take pictures of test papers and questions using button-hole cameras hidden in pens (pictured, camera circled) which are then sent to someone outside the hall using an antenna . Police display receiver equipment used by somebody outside the exam hall to pick up the pictures. That person then looks up the answer, before reading it back to the student . The helper then looks up the answer . to the question, and relays it back to a mobile phone hidden on the . pupil in the exam hall.The speech is picked up via the mobile, then sent . on to a hidden earpiece. Police . in Hubei, Shandong and Hebei provinces have busted a number of . suspected criminal groups helping senior year students to cheat on the . National Higher Education Entrance Examination. The exam, known as the 'gaokao', takes place on June 7 and 8 this year, and will be taken by 9.5million children hoping to get into universities across the country. Education is highly valued in China, with many parents sending their children miles each day just to go to school, and many are afraid they will be harshly punished for failure. 'Education and police authorities will continue to investigate crimes including stealing and selling examination papers, leaking information to exam sitters, providing equipment designed for cheating, and cyber attacks on exam websites,' said an education department spokesman. The mobile is connected to a hidden earpiece which allows the pupil to listen to the answer without attracting attention from exam invigilators . The whole kit can be concealed inside something as small as a vest, with the antenna stitched into the neckband and everything else tucked into pockets or down trousers . Authorities in China say they have rumbled criminal gangs manufacturing these systems for students. They favour cheap mobile handsets as they are easier to dismantle and then rebuilt including the antenna and earpiece . He warned that cheating students would . be stripped of the enrollment qualification for a period ranging from . one to three years. Parents involved will also be seriously punished. Earlier this week it was revealed how one Chinese school has become a place of pilgrimage for anxious parents and children who come to pray there. The school has an outstanding academic record, which has led to superstitions among locals that praying there will help pupils pass exams. The school also has a huge 'tree of knowledge' that stands inside the grounds, which people think has magical powers to make children excel in tests. Another, slightly more sophisticated, system sees the camera hidden in a watch (bottom left) which then transmits wirelessly to a receiver (in the box) with a person feeding answers back through and earpiece (right, in the small white box) Exam invigilators have now been equipped with radio signal detectors and hand wands they can use to scan students during tests to see if they are broadcasting data to someone outside the hall . A much less sophisticated system has pupils writing on their hands with ultraviolet pens, then using a tiny black-light hidden in a different pen to reveal the answers in the exam hall .","Authorities in China released pictures of gadgets used to cheat exams .

"He's back! 'Deadbeat dad' Terry  Turnage owes at least 17 women child support in both Tennessee and Arkansas . A man dubbed 'deadbeat dad' for owing child support on 25 children to 15 different women is now wanted in another state for owing money on three more kids he fathered. Terry Tyrone Turnage was wanted two years ago in Memphis, Tennessee, because he owed thousands in back child support for the care of dozens of children. Turnage, believed to be in his late thirties, has popped up again in Forrest City, Arkansas, where he owes money to at least two women, and probably a third, for children they claim were fathered by him. The exact number of children he has fathered and the exact number of women involved remains unclear. Paula Stewart, 22, who has a two-year-old son by Turnage, told WREG this week: 'Everybody tells me, ''What you doing talking to him?'' '''How you didn’t know he had all these kids?'' Uh duh, I’ve been in school. I wasn’t out like that.' A second woman, Miesha Davis,  found out the father of her son was 'famous' after a conversation with the child support office. She believed that her little boy was number 26 and that Turnage had a child by another woman between her and Miss Stewart. Turnage is known in Forrest City as a club owner who drives expensive cars and has the nickname TYB, which reportedly stands for 'Take Your B*****'. He recently threw a 700-person birthday party over two days at his club where he boasted about spending hundreds of dollars on top-shelf champagne. Both Miss Stewart and Miss Davis went to the club event saying that they just went 'to have a good time' and not to see Turnage. Scroll down for video . Miesha Davis (pictured left) and Paula Stewart (right) were dumbfounded when they realized that the father of their toddler sons had dozens of children from previous relationships . Turnage, who owes at least 15 women child support in Tennessee has now shown up in Arkansas where the list of mothers waiting on child support from him is growing . During a recent child support hearing in Forrest City, Turnage did not show up for his appointment. In 2012, a girlfriend, who had spent nearly eight years with Turnage, said her 'knees buckled' when a prosecutor at family court told her that the father of her child had 20 other children. 'During the whole relationship, I only knew of four children,' Latoya Shields told WREG in 2012. 'At that time, three years ago, my child was the 21st child. Yeah, that would be overwhelming for anybody.' The father of a reported 26 children recently threw a 700-person birthday party over two days at his club where he boasted about spending hundreds of dollars on champagne . Turnage is known in Forrest City as a club owner who drives expensive cars and has the nickname TYB, which reportedly stands for 'Take Your B*****' In May 2012, Turnage filed a petition at Shelby County Juvenile Court to lower his child support payments for the mothers of his children - but never turned up to the hearing. Miss Shields said the dad has shown little interest in his daughter. 'She calls him and it's a ""hi"" and ""bye, see you later"" type of situation,' she said. Miss Shields has only ever received checks from him between $6 and $9 dollars. He was ordered by a judge to pay her $259 dollars a month. A phone number linked to Turnage was disconnected on Thursday when called by MailOnline. Latoya Shields said in 2012 that 'her knees buckled' when she found out that Turnage, the father of her child, had at least 20 more kids .","Terry Tyrone Turnage was wanted two years ago in Memphis, Tennessee, because he owed thousands in back child support to dozens of children .

"A former North Korean counter-intelligence officer has claimed that Kim Jong-Un is no longer in control of the nation and is now just a 'puppet leader'. Jang Jin-sung, who used to be an influential officer in Kim Jong-il's propaganda division, made the sensational assertion at a September conference in Holland attended by several elite exiles, it's been reported. The capital, Pyongyang, meanwhile, has been placed into lockdown with even the elite banned from entering or leaving, according to a respected news site. This adds weight to Jin-sung's claim, as a North Korean expert said that this kind of measure is only put in place when a coup has taken place - or is suspected. A former North Korean counter-intelligence officer has claimed that Kim Jong-Un is no longer in control of the nation . Jang Jin-sung, who used to be an influential officer in Kim Jong-il's propaganda division, said Kim Jong-Un was actually overthrown in 2013 . Jin-sung said that Kim Jong-Un was actually overthrown in 2013 and that the political strings in North Korea are being pulled by the powerful Organization and Guidance Department (OGD), which used to report directly to Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-Un's father. North Korea is currently embroiled in a sort of civil war, he said in his speech. Some officials want to keep the communist status quo, he said, others are open to elements of capitalism being introduced. He told Vice News: 'On one hand, it's people who want to maintain a regime monopoly. On the other hand, it's not like people are fighting against the regime, but in a policy sense they want to take advantage to get influence. It's not actually consciously civil war, but there are these two incompatible forces at play.' Remco Breuker, a professor of Korean Studies at Leiden University in the Netherlands, which hosted the conference, backs-up Jin-sung's statements. He told the news site: 'The real power resides within that one department, the OGD, that was groomed to bureaucratic perfection by Kim Jong-il. It serves him [Kim Jong-Un], but it more serves the legacy of Kim Jong-il. Those don't always coincide.' Jin-sung believes that the current North Korean regime will collapse in the near future and that Kim Jong-Un could be replaced by one of his brothers, either Kim Jong-nam, 43, or Kim Jong-chul, 33. Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs, told The Telegraph that the current lockdown in the capital - revealed by the New Focus International news web site this week - could mean that the regime has become dangerously unstable. He said: 'This sort of action suggests there has either been an attempted coup or that the authorities there have uncovered some sort of plot against the leadership. 'If it is a military-backed coup, then the situation in Pyongyang will be very dangerous and I have heard reports that Kim has been moved out of the capital.' State media acknowledged for the first time last month that Kim Jong-Un, who assumed power in North Korea when his father died in 2011, was suffering from 'discomfort' due to unspecified health reasons, prompting speculation over what ails him. North Korea, founded by the young Kim's grandfather when a post-Japanese colonised Korean peninsula was divided into North and South in 1945, is a hereditary dictatorship - making the health of its leaders an especially sensitive subject. Kim, who is 31 and frequently the centrepiece of the state propaganda machine, has not been photographed by official media since appearing at a concert alongside his wife on September 3. Footage from an event with key officials in July showed him walking with a limp. Hungry, sir? Kim Jong-un inspects a dining room at Seoul Ryu Kyong Su 105 Guards Tank Division of the Korean People's Army in North Korea . Obese Kim is believed to have sprained then fractured his ankles during a gruelling tour of military bases and factories in shoes with Cuban heels to give him a little more height. He is pictured walking surrounded by weeping members of the Korean Children's Union . It was reported that he has piled on so much weight that he has fractured both his ankles and remains in hospital after an operation. The leader of the impoverished nation is estimated to have ballooned to 20 stone as a result of fine wining and dining - putting enormous pressure on his feet and legs. A source who has recently returned to the South Korean capital, Seoul, from the North said Kim is still in hospital under guard from his personal protection team. Obese Kim is believed to have sprained then fractured his ankles during a gruelling tour of military bases and factories in shoes with Cuban heels to give him a little more height and a physical appearance of more authority. The leader got a taste for Swiss cheese while a student in Switzerland - and is understood to love it so much that he imports vast quantities, despite Western sanctions. 'He has become noticeably overweight since he came to power,' said the un-named intelligence official. This is not the first time Kim Jong Un has been missing from public view. For most of June 2012, six months after coming to power, state media failed to report on or photograph him for 23 days. He resurfaced the next month at a dolphinarium.","An elite exile from North Korea said Kim Jong-Un was ousted in 2013 .

"A student who fractured her spine leaping into an African waterfall has taught herself to walk again. Deven McAlister was on a gap year adventure when she  dived into the water striking the rocky bottom of the plunge pool. The impact crushed her spine, breaking it in two places and left her needing emergency surgery. The brave 19-year-old endured intensive physiotherapy and strength training to get back on her feet. Brave teen: Deven McAlister,19, has battled to walk again after she fractured her spine diving into a plunge pool during a gap year adventure in South Africa . 'I was in and out of consciousness,' said the teen, recalling the accident in January this year. 'I've been told by my friends that I was in a lot of pain. I remember being in an ambulance and then the hospital, but it's all a blur.' Miss McAlister was  traveling through Mpumalanga, in the east of South Africa, as part of her year out before starting university, when the accident happened. The x ray pictured on the left shows Miss McAlister's fractured spine before she underwent surgery to repair the damage. Medics placed six pins in her vertebrae (pictured right) During a visit to a waterfall with her travel companions in January this year the teen  dived from a ledge into the pool below. She was carried back to the top of the cliff by her new friends and taken by ambulance to a local A&E. She was 10 days into the 10 week adventure. Doctor's in the remote safari resort initially believed she had only suffered muscle damage and despite her excruciating pain she was encouraged to stand and walk. The following day she was transferred to a private hospital for more scans and they discovered Miss McAlister had suffered a compressed fracture and dislocated the T12-L1 part of her spine. The keen hockey player endured a week in intensive care before she finally had surgery on her back. Surgeons placed six pins in her back as part of a spinal fusion to repair the damage. 'This was very hard to deal with as I was in a foreign country without my family,' said Miss McAlister. Pictured with an elephant in South Africa before the accident that left Miss McAlister with a fractured spine . 'Before my operation I was on a lot of drugs and I can barely remember anything other than my friends visiting me in hospital. 'My mum and dad had to fly out to South Africa. I remember bits of them being there. It was tough.' After the surgery the young woman from Bowness, in Windermere, Cumbria, faced the daunting prospect of learning to walk again. 'I had been lying down for weeks so when I sat up I felt really ill. I felt like I was walking on water. 'Every day it was about doing a few more steps and eventually going up the stairs.' She was discharged from the African hospital after just a week of demanding physiotherapy. Her proudest moment came when she was able to push her own wheelchair out of hospital. 'It's a memory that will stay with her forever,' said Miss McAlister. 'I had missed two and a half weeks of my volunteer program already and I was desperate to complete it to the best of my ability,' she said. 'It took a lot of time and effort, doing daily exercises which before the accident were so simple and after so exhausting.' Miss McAlister had to miss some of the activities, but she managed to complete the 10 week placement. When she returned home she her to put her university plans on hold, and has spent the past 11 months regaining as much fitness, strength and flexibility as possible. 'Since the accident I have reconsidered what I want to do,' she said. 'It's completely changed my life. I've always done a lot of charity work but it's completely opened my eyes. I want to do more.' Learning to walk again was like 'walking on water,' said the pretty teenager, who had intensive physiotherapy . 'The hardest bit is I've spent a lot of time getting my fitness back. 'A lot of people think 'how can you move on from an injury like that?' But I get on with it and turn it around. 'I know I am very lucky,' she said. 'I have had to build all my muscles up again but I am as strong as I have ever been.' Deven McAlister is planning to take part in a grueling London to Paris cycling challenge to raise money for spinal injury research . Miss McAlister is now planning to push her recovering body to the limit by completing a grueling 300 mile London to Paris bike ride to raise money for Nicholls Spinal Injury Foundation. She will be joined by her cousin, Becky Anderson, in April for the mammoth cycle and the pair are hoping to raise £3,000. 'The work the charity do is amazing,' Miss McAlister said. 'Without the knowledge gained and shared through research I would not have recovered as well as I have. 'At the moment they are supporting scientists to find a cure for paralysis - to think that there could be a cure for that is just crazy. 'The charity was set up after a man around my age broke his neck while also on a gap year. It is so close to home.'

But Senator Lambie also flagged she would be independently minded, saying her party's leader and founder Clive Palmer did not 'control' her. 'We've all got a head on our shoulders.' Former rugby league giant Glenn Lazarus, who is also a Palmer United Party senator, said ahead of two-day 'senator kindy' for the new senate team that it felt like being 'back in the front row'. The new senators have spent the morning filling out paperwork and being briefed by the Senate procedure office on how to be sworn in, electing a president, basic rules of debate and the legislative process. NSW Liberal Democratic Party senator David Leyonhjelm will be taking notes on how to amend bills and separate them out of packages of legislation. Senator Leyonhjelm wants to separate the second round of tax cuts and welfare payments out of the carbon tax repeal package so they can go ahead as planned by Labor. On Thursday evening, the new senators will have dinner with the Senate Deputy President Stephen Parry, who is expected to be elected President on Monday.

"Grinning from ear to ear, this picture shows little Leo Hargreaves was rather happy with his world – even before he was born. And his parents believe their son may be the happiest baby in Britain as he hasn’t stopped smiling since. The remarkable image was taken from an ultrasound scan at 31 weeks. Happy: A 4D scan of Leo Hargreaves inside his mother's womb at 31 weeks revealed he was smiling . His mother Amy Cregg, 24, said: 'My partner Leighton and I were absolutely shocked - even the people who did my scan were amazed. 'But that was just the beginning. After he was born, he was always smiling - even in his sleep.' Now nearly five months old, Leo has been dubbed the happiest baby in Britain. The image is a 4D scan - increasingly popular with expectant parents to get a glimpse of how their child will look. Rather then the grainy ‘flat’ images produced by the 2D scanners usually used by the NHS, a 4D machine stitches together pictures taken from a variety of angles to create clear three-dimensional images. Leo's parents say since his birth the baby, dubbed the happiest in Britain,  has not stopped smiling . These are then recorded on video – the fourth dimension. Ms Cregg, from Accrington, Lancashire, said she has already had modelling companies approach her trying to capture Leo’s smile. The rehabilitation support worker said: 'I’ve been walking in the park and had people come up to me and say ""What a gorgeous baby"". 'I’d be interested in him doing modelling but only when he’s older.' A spokesman for the company that performed the scan, at Babybond Ultrasound Direct in Burnley, said: 'Our sonographer who scanned Amy and her gorgeous baby was overwhelmed at her smiley baby throughout the entire scan. Content: Now five months old, Leo even smiles in his sleep and was described as the 'smiliest' baby his mother's sonographer had ever seen . Attracting attention: Leo's parents, Amy Cregg and Leighton Hargreaves, say they have already had modelling companies approach them about Leo’s smile . 'I think we can safely say that he is the smiliest baby we’ve ever seen. 4D scans are a highly developed form of traditional ultrasound where very high frequency sound waves are used to produce images of what is inside the body. As with older forms of ultra-sound, sound waves a emitted from a transducer, or probe, which is placed on the mother's abdomen and then moved to 'look at' areas in the uterus. These sound waves bounce back off the foetus, helping to create a 'picture' of the child on a screen. 4D scans use the same frequency of sound waves as in a normal ultrasound. But the sound waves are directed from many more angles, producing a 'real-time' video of the foetus as it moves and allowing scientists to say the images are in four dimensions.","4D scan of Leo Hargreaves taken 31 weeks into mother's pregnancy .

"After weeks of fresh sea air, endless sunshine, and having every whim catered for, it’s little wonder many cruise passengers return home with a sinking feeling. But it appears they’re weighed down by more than simply post-holiday blues. Most cruise passengers gain a pound a day in weight during a two-week holiday at sea, according to a poll – coming back a stone heavier than when they left. All-you-can-eat: Passengers blame the high-class but often calorific dining facilities on board the ship for the extraordinary weight gain . Their broader waistlines are hardly a . surprise – given the relaxing onboard lifestyle plus mountains of food . available round the clock. Many respondents reckoned they put on . more weight cruising than they do at Christmas, having enjoyed the . high-class, but often high-calorie and ‘all you can eat’ dining . facilities offered on most modern vessels. The findings of the study, by . independent cruise travel agents Bonvoyage.co.uk, are unlikely to . encourage anyone watching their weight to sign up for a seaborne . adventure. Tempting: Cruise dining often sees passengers indulge in bigger meals than they're used to . They surveyed 1,281 Britons who had . been on a cruise and found 52 per cent said they put on up to a stone . during a two-week holiday. One in 11 (9 per cent) put on around . 4lbs while a further 6 per cent were even worse and put on up to 18lbs. Pugh: 'I'll break it gently. Some people might think you've been on a cruise' More than eight in ten (84 per cent) admitted they ate a lot more than . normal as they sailed the oceans and 31 per cent admitted  they ate . double their normal calories. And more than four in ten (41 per cent) struggle to shift the extra weight once they got home. Steph Curtin, cruise development . manager of Bonvoyage.co.uk said: ‘I am as guilty as these respondents . when it comes to indulging when on a cruise holiday, as the delicious . food and drink on offer can be difficult to say no to. ‘This is particularly the case when on . an all-inclusive cruise, where you know that all of the tempting food . on offer has already been paid for.’ Most cruises contain a wide variety . of eateries, from fine-dining restaurants to fish and chip-style . takeaways. Many provide ‘midnight feasts’, while restaurants often stay . open until the early hours to indulge guests. Control: It can be hard to say no at the cruise ship buffet lines . Some ships have recognised . the difficulties for passengers and have begun to offer healthier . alternatives. Passenger Rosalie Nunn, 27, from . Lincoln, joined a world cruise last year and was surprised to find a . tailor on board whose main job was to adjust clothing that was becoming . too tight. She said: ‘The tailor said most people will leave the ship at . least one dress size bigger. ‘One lady who is a regular cruise-goer . said she brings larger-sized clothing to accommodate the inevitable . weight gain.’ She added: ‘The results don’t surprise me – the food is . constant and you’ve got to be well restrained to resist it.’ Celebrity chef: Marco Pierre White has restaurants on board four of the P&O cruise fleet .","Tempting food and drink sees seaborne holiday makers gain a pound every day .

"Nurses at a world-leading children’s hospital have been so stressed and exhausted that patient safety was at risk, a shocking report reveals. An internal inquiry at Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool found staff had fainted in operating theatres or been ‘physically and mentally’ unable to perform procedures because of long hours and a ‘culture of fear and bullying’ by management. The report, leaked to The Mail on Sunday after the hospital was forced to release it under Freedom of Information laws, found that some nurses had contemplated suicide and many were distressed after being forced to cover high levels of sickness absence. Nurses at Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool have fainted in theatre after being overwhelmed by a 'culture of fear and bullying', according to a shocking new report . The nurses complained that the number of staff on sick leave was higher than those available to work.

"A law student accused of targeting Tony Blair as part of a Mumbai-style terror plot also wanted to join forces with the sons of radical cleric Abu Hamza to commit an armed robbery, a court heard. Erol Incedal, 26, is on trial charged with planning an act of terrorism, either on individuals or a wide-ranging Mumbai-style attack. He is also charged with possessing a bomb-making manual on a memory card. Mr Justice Nicol told jurors at the Old Bailey that sketches and notes found at his family home related to plans for an armed robbery and used code words such as 'tennis rackets' for guns. An artist sketch of Erol Incedal (centre), who has appeared on trial at the Old Bailey, accused of planning  an act of terrorism, as well as sketching out plans to work with the sons of Abu Hamza on an armed robbery . 'He was friends with three sons of the radical cleric Abu Hamza - Hamza, Sufyan and Yaasir - who used to carry out frauds and armed robberies on post offices,' said Mr Justice Nicol. 'The defendant sketched out some ideas for armed an robbery he would propose to the Hamza brothers.' The sketches had a number of coded words including a hand-written diagram around the word Jamal which was also to do with the robbery plan, according to the defendant, the court heard. Incedal attributed some notes interspersed with course work to his idea to set up a butcher's shop in London like a successful store his uncle had in Spain. But his uncle refused to help fund the plans. The judge told the jury: 'The defendant told you he wrote these notes during the course of his lectures and seminars and that's why they appear in his course notes. They were written in the latter part of 2011. Mr Justice Nicol told the court that Incedal wanted to join forces with Abu Hamza's sons. He also reminded the jury of the 26-year-old's troubled childhood . 'He did not share the ideas with the Hamza brothers or anyone else. He did not commit a robbery or make a positive decision to do so. He last saw these notes in the early part of 2012. The prosecution do not accept his explanation for these notes.' As well as the proposed heist, the Turkish-born defendant also had money woes and had been caught cheating with the wife of a violent brother-in-law, the court heard. At the time, the South Bank university law and accountancy student had trouble providing for his wife, whom he married at the age of 17, and their two children, the judge said. Incedal previously told the jury that had affairs with a number of women, despite his marriage to Kadeejah Baluch who he shared a home with in Unity Court, south east London. The judge said: 'He had affairs with a number of women. One was the wife of his brother-in-law. Her husband discovered what was going on and he was very angry. He (Incedal) was frightened of what his brother-in-law might do. 'He had a violent reputation and allegedly killed one man already. He was in prison in Oman awaiting trial for credit card fraud.' The defendant was also asked about his political beliefs. Incedal believed resistance to foreign intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan was 'justified' and supported rebels against the Assad regime in Syria. However, Incedal said he believed terrorism in the UK was 'illegal, immoral and contrary to Islam' and could lead to Muslims being harmed, the court heard. The judge, who was summing up Incedal's evidence, also reminded the jury of his troubled childhood. He was born in 1988 in Turkey where his father had been a member of the Turkish communist party and died when he was very young. His sister was a member of the PKK and was killed in fighting too, the court heard. His mother, who was from the Syria/Iraq region, brought Incedal and his siblings to the UK when he was just one year old. His brother had been detained in a mental hospital and Incedal was excluded from primary school and almost excluded from secondary school, the judge said. At the age of 12 he was convicted of attempted theft but a year later he became interested in Islam and joined the Tableeghi Jamaat religious movement, travelling with them to Greece, New York and Bangladesh. The trial, which is being partly heard behind closed doors, continued in a private session.

"It's been six days since hackers broke into the cloud-based storage systems of more than 100 celebrities and exposed private, mostly-naked pictures of them online. And finally online noticeboard Reddit have disabled the page that allowed people to view, post and share the images, with at least 400 shots of different actresses and athletes - among them Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence, model Kate Upton and reality star Kim Kardashian - said to have hit the internet. In banning the offending forums, Reddit CEO Yishan Wong suggested the delayed response was a freedom of speech issue, despite the invasions of privacy being lamented as criminal. Wong described Reddit as 'the government of a new type of community' rather than a company running a website, according to Recode. Scroll down for video .

The site was one of the primary destinations where nude photos of celebrities like Jennifer Lawrence (right) were being shared . The headlining forum to be close was called 'The Fappening', which was created solely for the cache of leaked celebrity photos. 'While current US law does not prohibit (Reddit) linking to stolen materials, we deplore the theft of these images and we do not condone their widespread distribution,' Wong wrote in a blog post. 'Nevertheless, reddit’s platform is structurally based on the ability for people to distribute, promote, and highlight textual materials as well as links to images and other media. 'We understand the harm that misusing our site does to the victims of this theft, and we deeply sympathize.' Wong does not immediately address shutting down The Fappening, however vistors to the site are now greeted with a message from Reddit saying the page has been banned. Wong went on to essentially say what happens on the site is the responsibility of the user, and not the site itself. 'We uphold the ideal of free speech on reddit as much as possible not because we are legally bound to, but because we believe that you - the user - has the right to choose between right and wrong, good and evil, and that it is your responsibility to do so.

Sharing such photos would be considered child pornography. 'Fap' is a slang term used in online communities for masturbating. Reddit is owned by Advance Publications, which also owns Vogue publisher Condé Nast.

"'Oiling the wheels of terror': Former home secretary David Blunkett has accused the Gulf kingdoms of not doing enough to stop terrorist funding . Gulf States must take action against citizens who are funding terror across the globe, former home secretary David Blunkett has said. Countries including Qatar, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are tolerating and even protecting funders of the so-called Islamic State insurgent group, Mr Blunkett claimed. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph he said: 'It is the money made through the sale of oil in what are substantially oil-rich fiefdoms which is oiling the wheels of terror. 'It is being used to purchase the armaments and facilitate the sophisticated communication of Isil (Islamic State) militants and others.' The Gulf states had long handed money and weapons to Sunni Islamist factions in the rebellion against the largely secular Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, in the hope that his overthrow would lead to a Sunni state. It was thought such a reordering of power break Shia Iran's link to the Mediterranean. But althought it is claimed that they have not officially funded Islamic State terrorists, there are deep religious and political sympathies between the group and powerful figures in the Gulf states. And Qatar and Saudi Arabia, in particular, are notorious for using their vast oil wealth to support and promote hardline Islamic teachings known as Wahabbism . Now however they face a potential backlash from the very doctrine they have helped create, with hardline Islamists decrying what they see as corruption in the royal families of the Gulf states. Last week Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi called for attacks against the rulers of Saudi Arabia, saying his self-declared caliphate was expanding there and in four other Arab countries. Baghdadi urged supporters in Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, to take the fight to the rulers of the kingdom, which has joined the U.S.-led coalition in mounting air strikes against the Islamic State group in Syria. 'O sons of al-Haramayn...the serpent's head and the stronghold of the disease are there...draw your swords and divorce life, because there should be no security for the Saloul,' Baghdadi said, using a derogatory term to refer to the leadership of Saudi Arabia. Haramayn is a reference to the two holiest places in Islam - both of them in Saudi Arabia. Direct donations are understood to be only a small part of the IS income stream now. U.S. Treasury official David Cohen, who has investigated the group's finances, last month estimated it was earning about $1million a day from black market oil sales alone. It also generates cash from criminal enterprises such as extortion, bank robbery and kidnapping for ransom. Only a small amount of its funding is believed to come from outside donors. Saudi defense minister Prince Salman bin Abdel-Aziz: Saudi Arabia is one of the countries taking part in military action as part of the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria . Recalling his time as home secretary after the September 11 terror attacks on New York's Twin Towers, Mr Blunkett said he had been surprised to learn that names which appeared on US sanctions lists, subjecting those suspected of funding terrorists to asset freezing and travel bans, did not feature on UK lists. While Mr Blunkett welcomed David Cameron's recent announcement on a Bill which would include powers to cancel the passports of UK nationals who travel abroad to fight for IS, he said preventing money reaching 'our deadliest enemies' is an even more important matter. Mr Blunkett said: 'Pressure needs to come not just from the UK and the US, but from all those nations committed to providing a stable and secure world in which trade can flourish, poverty can be reduced and freedom from fear can be secured.'","Oil-rich states are 'oiling the wheels of terror' says Mr Blunkett .

He said: ‘Countries sharing the currency must be able to refinance a large part of their debt under the same conditions.’ Such a bond would allow Europe’s . poorer countries to raise money cheaply, because French and German . financial muscle would act as a guarantee. Soros told Germany's Der Spiegel magazine that Portugal and Greece leaving would not kill off the euro - or the EU. Debt-stricken Greece and Portugal are struggling to implement eurozone and International Monetary Fund-mandated reforms by slashing spending and raising taxes in exchange for financial aid. European shares experienced slight gains as investors focused on tomorrow’s meeting between France and Germany to deal with the current financial crisis in the region. President Nicholas Sarkozy and Chancellor Angela Merkel have taken leading roles in the debt crisis and will hold talks and a press conference in Paris. Soros also suggested the time had come for eurozone members to accept the introduction of eurobonds. 'Whether you like it or not, the euro exists. And for it to function properly, countries sharing the currency must be able to refinance a large part of their debt under the same conditions,' he said. Berlin is opposed to the introduction of such bonds, but Soros suggested Germany, as Europe's strongest financial partner, should be responsible for defining the rules for its introduction. Soros, who made over $1billion by betting against the British pound in 1992, also said he had no intention of playing the market against the common european currency. 'I am certainly not betting against the euro, because the Chinese have a huge interest in an alternative to the dollar and will do everything possible to help Europeans save it,' he said. Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Nicholas Sarkozy (pictured here in December last year) have taken leading roles in the debt crisis and will hold talks and a press conference in Paris. Both Greece and Portugal, along with Ireland, have been granted multi-billion EU-IMF rescue loans to prevent them from defaulting on their huge debts. Despite Berlin’s resistance to the idea of eurobonds, today one of Germany’s leading economic associations came out in favour of the move, claiming all other avenues had been exhausted. BGA export association president Anton Boerner said: ‘What is the alternative? 'The alternative is the markets attack Italy, then France, we lose our AAA rating and then it's our turn. This is a downward spiral that would lead to a worldwide depression. 'What have we achieved then? We'll end up paying [for the crisis] three times over. This way we pay just once.' The head of the centre-left Social Democrats, Sigmar Gabriel, has also backed the idea, telling German public television station ARD late on Sunday that eurozone countries should be able to raise 50-60 per cent of their funding through such joint issues if they agreed to certain conditions. Sarkozy (left) was pictured this weekend at a lunch with crew members of the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle during a visit aboard the ship in Toulon. Merkel, right, attended a ceremony commemorating the 50th anniversary of the construction of the Berlin Wall . 'States that use eurobonds would have to agree to give up a degree of sovereignty over their own budgets,' Gabriel said. After unveiling tougher austerity plans in return for European Central Bank help, Italian Economy Minister Giulio Tremonti said a common eurozone bond would stop markets forcing high-debt economies in the bloc to the brink. 'We would not have arrived where we are if we had had the eurobond,' he said on Saturday. Merkel and Sarkozy are instead expected to discuss improving economic governance in the eurozone. Officials have suggested they could agree to introduce regular meetings of eurozone leaders - a longstanding French demand - and enlarge the role of European Council President Herman van Rompuy to make him a spokesman for the euro. These steps could bring greater policy discipline in the 17-nation currency bloc, which has regularly sowed confusion in the markets by talking with disparate voices, but are unlikely to assuage market concerns about the high debt and deficit levels of certain countries in the bloc. Yields on Italian and Spanish bonds fell back to around five percent last week after the ECB intervened in the market to support them. The ECB is due to publish data detailing how many bonds it bought in the week up to last Wednesday. Both German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble and Economy Minister Philipp Roesler gave interviews over the weekend in which they spoke out against eurozone bonds and debt collectivization. Conservative German newspaper Die Welt, however, reported that the government was no longer ruling out the idea. Merkel, whose popularity has sunk to its lowest level in nearly five years according to recent polls, could face a revolt within her coalition and Germany's broader economic policy establishment if she agreed to joint bond issuance. Her coalition partners, the Free Democrats (FDP) and the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), are seen as dead-set against the idea. The leadership of the FDP have set a meeting for Wednesday to discuss their stance on the euro crisis, which will be chaired by Roesler, a party spokesman said. German media reports have said a working group within Merkel's own Christian Democrats (CDU) has been studying the idea of eurobonds in greater detail, suggesting some may be open to it. But leading members of the party have ruled it out in clear terms in recent weeks and other northern European member states, such as the Netherlands and Finland are also vehemently opposed. Boerner of the BGA said, however, that eurobonds may be the only solution that can prevent the markets from launching new assaults on eurozone members. 'We must show the markets that we are ready to use the appropriate tools, and that means eurobonds signed off by Germany,' said Boerner. 'We need eurobonds with strict conditions attached. We need this and we need it fast.' On the up: After the drama of last week, the FTSE made marginal gains today .

"David Cameron was under pressure to hand back a £160,000 donation from the wife of a Russian oligarch last night, following his call for sanctions over the fate of flight MH17. Tory sources last night indicated the party intends to keep the donation, which was made earlier this month by banker Lubov Chernukhin in return for the chance to play the ‘ultimate tennis match’ against Mr Cameron and the London Mayor Boris Johnson. The donor is married to billionaire oligarch Vladimir Chernukhin, who was Russia’s deputy finance minister during Vladimir Putin’s first term as Russian President. David Cameron is facing calls to return money bid in an auction to play him and Boris Johnson in a game of tennis, won by Lubov Chernukhin . Mr Chernukhin was also a director of Russia’s national airline Aeroflot and is a former chairman of the country’s state development bank. He received Russia’s Order of Honour from Mr Putin a decade ago. Former Tory Treasurer Lord Ashcroft last night questioned whether the party should still be accepting Russian money. In a message on Twitter he said: ‘Should the Tory Party suspend taking donations from companies owned by Russians?’ Labour MP John Mann said Mr Cameron should ‘put his money where his mouth is’, return the money to Mrs Chernukhin and cancel the tennis match. Mr Mann said: ‘He has got to hand the money back – it is one of the easiest sanctions that can be imposed. ‘I am sure the Prime Minister will recognise he cannot accept this money – he cannot possibly be seen to be consorting on a tennis court with individuals who have been part of Putin’s inner circle, and he should not be taking their money. ‘After all that he has said it would be truly shocking if Mr Cameron and Boris Johnson kept this money for the Tory Party.’ Commons Speaker John Bercow also appeared to allude to the row yesterday during Mr Cameron’s statement to MPs on the MH17 crisis. In a comment that annoyed Tory MPs, Mr Bercow drew attention to the ‘frequency of the Prime Minister’s tennis playing’. The tennis match was auctioned off at a lavish Tory fundraising dinner at London’s plush Hurlingham Club earlier this month, which was attended by the Chernukhins. According to Electoral Commission records Mrs Chernukhin was once declared an ‘impermissible’ donor when she tried to give the Tories £10,000 in April 2012. This means that at the time she did not meet the criteria required to make a donation to a British political party. Lubov Chernukhin is married to billionaire oligarch Vladimir Chernukhin, who was Russia’s deputy finance minister during Vladimir Putin’s first term as Russian President . However since then Mrs Chernukhin, who is understood to be a Conservative Party member, has since made three donations worth a total of £5,500, which have all been accepted. Tory sources would not comment directly last night on whether the tennis match would go ahead. But they insisted there was no reason not to accept the donation. A spokesman said: ‘All donations to the Conservative Party are fully and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission and published on their website.’ The Conservatives, in common with Labour, refuse to release details of those who attend their fundraising events. But a leaked list from last year’s Tory summer ball revealed it was attended by a number of wealthy Russians. These included Vasily Shestakov, an MP in Russia’s parliament who is an old friend of President Putin and his long-term judo partner. He co-wrote several books on the sport with the Russian President including Learn Judo With Vladimir Putin. Also present were billionaire banker Andrei Borodin and his model wife Tatanya Korsakova, owners of Britain’s most expensive home, the £140 million Park Place, near Henley-on-Thames.","Banker Lubov Chernukhin won auction at Conservative party fundraiser .

"He seemed somewhat out of place amid the traditional, old-fashioned ceremony of Changing the Guard. But this heavily armed soldier in combat fatigues proved every bit as much of an attraction to the camera-wielding tourists at Horse Guards Parade in London yesterday. Troops with machine guns have been deployed alongside their red-clad sword-bearing comrades as a security measure following the shooting of a ceremonial guard outside the Canadian parliament. On guard: Armed soldiers carrying assault rifles were seen on the streets of Westminster yesterday as the military boosted security measures in the aftermath of the attack on the Canadian parliament last week . Duty: Soldiers from The Blues and Royals dressed in camouflage uniforms and carrying assault rifles were photographed walking past tourists gathered outside the entrance to Horse Guards Parade yesterday . Thousands of visitors gather at Horse Guards Parade in Whitehall each morning to witness Changing the Guard. The entrance, part of the Buckingham Palace estate and open to the public during the day, is usually guarded by two men in tunic on horseback and two on foot. But the buildings are also the headquarters of the Army’s London District and provide accommodation for soldiers in the Queen’s Life Guard, a unit which carries out ceremonial duties and performs on state occasions. Attraction: Although popular with tourists, Horse Guards Parade is a working military barracks where soldiers, including The Life Guards - one of whom is seen in here the red tunic - live and work . Vigilent: As with other military bases, soldiers are permanently on guard at the entrance but since Monday these troops from the Household Cavalry Regiment have been more prominent . Senior officers made the decision to deploy armed troops there after Corporal Nathan Cirillo, 24, was shot dead by an Islamist fanatic a week ago while on unarmed guard duty at the National War Memorial in Ottawa. His killer, Muslim convert Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, was shot dead by Kevin Vickers, the Sergeant-At-Arms, when he stormed the parliament, firing a shot into the door of the room where Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper was hiding in a cupboard. Yesterday, a senior Army source said: ‘A decision was made by the local commander. They’ve probably looked at what happened in Canada and thought, “I’ll stick someone out there with a rifle as a bit of a deterrent in case anyone has got bad ideas”. ‘It’s a long time since there was an armed guard at Horse Guards Parade.’ Threat: The UK's terror threat level was raised from 'substantial' to 'severe' - meaning an attack is highly likely - in late August amid fears of a terrorist strike linked to Islamic State or another extremist group . Alert:  The MoD said security security arrangements were regularly reviewed at all of its establishments . A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ‘The MoD routinely reviews the security arrangements at all of its establishments. Clearly we do not comment publicly on the substance of these.’ The security review comes as Westminster is on high alert in case of a terrorist attack on Parliament. MPs are being told to consider fitting their constituency offices with panic buttons and designating a ‘safe room’ in their homes. They are also being briefed on the security plans in case of an attack on the Commons. ‘In the event of an incident involving firearms or other weapons, the police will take operational control. Firearms officers are deployed on the parliamentary estate and will respond to such incidents,’ the advice says. ‘If you hear gunfire, move away; but consider barricading yourself and others in a room if danger is close.’ Scotland Yard is already reviewing the Prime Minister’s security after a jogger ran into David Cameron on Monday as he left Leeds Civic Hall, sparking a major alert. Last night a Metropolitan Police spokesman declined to comment on whether police security arrangements had been stepped up in the wake of the Canadian attack.","Soldiers with assault rifles seen outside entrance to Horse Guards Parade .

"Over: Freud, 50, and Ms Murdoch, 46, who have two children, are expected to be granted a decree nisi this week. Above, the couple  together last year . The 13-year marriage of public relations guru Matthew Freud and Rupert Murdoch’s daughter Elisabeth has ended – less than a year after a family feud over Tony Blair’s relationship with Murdoch’s ex-wife, Wendi Deng. Freud, 50, and Ms Murdoch, 46, who have two children, are expected to be granted a decree nisi this week. The precise cause of the breakdown is not known, but well-placed sources say a long-running row between Freud and his media mogul father-in-law was a factor. One source described a ‘war of attrition’ between the two men. Elisabeth got caught in the crossfire when her husband sided with Blair after her father filed for divorce from Ms Deng after her reported ‘crush’ on the former Prime Minister and his discovery that the pair had spent weekends together without his knowledge. The Freuds – who are worth £250 million between them – have been dubbed ‘the ultimate media couple’. He grew his publicity business by advising everyone from the Department of Health to Spice Girl Geri Halliwell – while she founded the TV production company Shine, whose programmes include MasterChef. Their 22-bedroom Oxfordshire country home Burford Priory was once seen as the unofficial social headquarters of the Chipping Norton set, which included David and Samantha Cameron, former Sun editor Rebekah Brooks and Top Gear’s Jeremy Clarkson. Freud has also been close to Tony Blair since before he became Prime Minister – a friendship which has caused conflict with his father-in-law. Murdoch accused Freud of cultivating Ms Deng to deliberately antagonise him, and of sending him ‘crazy 3am emails’ making wild allegations. Murdoch was furious when Freud, great-grandson of Sigmund Freud, the pioneer of psychoanalysis, banned him from his 50th birthday party last year at which Tony and Cherie Blair were star guests. The first public sign that the Freuds’ marriage was on the rocks came in July this year when Blair threw a 60th birthday party for Cherie at their home in Buckinghamshire, attended by high-profile figures from politics, the media and showbusiness. The Freuds were assigned seats at Cherie’s top table but failed to turn up, leaving two starkly empty spaces. They also holidayed separately on different boats in the Mediterranean: Ms Murdoch with an old girlfriend, Freud apparently unaccompanied. A family friend said last night: ‘Matthew and Elisabeth were deeply in love but no couple could survive the emotional pressures they have been under in recent years.’ They met in 1997, when Elisabeth had been married for four years to Elkin Kwesi Pianim, a financier of Ghanaian origin, and was pregnant with his second child. Freud was married to Caroline Hutton – known as ‘Pidge’ – with whom he already had two sons. Ms Hutton, who was devastated by the break-up, went on to marry the 9th Earl Spencer, brother of Diana, Princess of Wales. The Freuds’ courtship was passionate. When former New Yorker editor Tina Brown hosted a restaurant dinner for them in London, a guest recalled them being ‘all over each other’ – and so keen to leave together that the supper came to an abrupt conclusion. Scroll down for video . Before the rift: From left, Rupert and Elisabeth Murdoch, Wendi Deng and Matthew Freud in 2008. Sources say a long-running row between Freud and his media mogul father-in-law was a factor in his marriage's breakdown . But in 2000, after Ms Murdoch had given birth to her and Freud’s first child, Charlotte Emma, the couple briefly separated, plunging Freud into a deep gloom which only lifted when they were re-united in 2001. They married at Blenheim Palace that year and went on to have a second child, Samson, now seven. Also in 2001, Ms Murdoch founded Shine which has since expanded into a multi-million-pound TV company, taking over other outfits such as Kudos, makers of Spooks and Broadchurch. Freud is the son of former Liberal MP Sir Clement Freud, and the brother of the radio presenter Emma, who is married to Love Actually director Richard Curtis. His uncle was the late painter Lucian Freud, and his cousins are the novelist Esther and designer Bella. Friends: Matthew, left, with former Prime Minister Tony Blair. The PR guru sided with Blair after his father-in-law filed for divorce from Ms Deng after her reported ‘crush’ on the former Prime Minister . After leaving Westminster School, he became a press officer for the RCA record label and by the age of 20 he was running his own company from a small flat in West London. Now called Freud Communications, it is worth £100 million and advises firms including Walkers Crisps and KFC. He became a member of Blair’s inner circle, especially close to Peter Mandelson who appointed him to work on the Millennium Dome. But Freud’s dealings with Rupert Murdoch have been described as ‘wary’ from the outset. According to one account, Murdoch ‘kept him at arm’s length’ for the first two years of his relationship with his daughter, before reluctantly agreeing to work with him on a minor project. Tension between the pair burst into the open in 2010 when Freud launched an outspoken attack on Roger Ailes, the boss of Fox News, the Right-wing US TV network owned by Murdoch’s News Corporation and one of Murdoch’s closest personal and business allies. Freud accused Fox News of an ‘horrendous and sustained disregard of the journalistic standards that News Corps, its founder and every other global media business aspires to’. According to some reports Freud was reportedly encouraged by Ms Deng and Elisabeth to attack Ailes as part of a family power struggle over the future of News Corps. It prompted a withering response by Ailes who said: ‘I was told Sigmund Freud had a vasectomy in 1927 – obviously not soon enough.’ But relations between Freud and his 83-year-old father-in-law finally disintegrated in the aftermath of Mr Murdoch’s discovery of Blair’s relationship with Ms Deng. The Mail on Sunday revealed last November how the former Prime Minister’s meetings with Ms Deng at Murdoch’s US homes and a note suggesting she had a ‘crush’ on him were key factors in his decision to file for divorce. Friends of Blair have always insisted there was no affair. And when Freud backed Blair, it led to a tit-for-tat war with Murdoch, climaxing with Freud banning his father-in-law from his 50th birthday party at Burford Priory, but inviting the Blairs. Power couple: Their 22-bedroom Oxfordshire country home Burford Priory was once seen as the unofficial social headquarters of the Chipping Norton set, which included David and Samantha Cameron. The ban came after Murdoch similarly snubbed Blair by banning him from a US media summit. Murdoch revealed his hurt at the 50th party rebuff via a source who said at the time: ‘Rupert is particularly upset that Matthew and Elisabeth held a party at exactly the time when rumours were circulating about Wendi and Blair. Rupert wasn’t invited but Blair was. That was a very public V-sign to Rupert.’ The source added: ‘Freud has been sending crazy 3am emails to Rupert making all sorts of accusations. Elisabeth is stuck in the middle and it has had a devastating effect on her relations with Rupert.’ The extent to which Elisabeth had become dragged into the battle was painfully clear in an extraordinary, and in hindsight, pointed statement issued by Freud. As the war of words intensified, he said last December: ‘I will be eternally grateful to Rupert Murdoch for producing Elisabeth, who is practically perfect in every way. On the rocks: Elisabeth was recently seen out without her wedding ring. The first public sign that her marriage was in trouble came in July this year . 'Our views differ quite dramatically on a number of subjects professionally and I regret that this has caused my relationship with him to be sometimes conflicted. ‘But we have had good times as well as bad times, we both love his daughter and his grandchildren, if not always each other. I do not believe anything else is terribly important.’ His ‘not always each other’ aside about Murdoch underlined the depth of animosity between them. His declaration of love for ‘practically perfect’ Elisabeth suggests he was committed to his marriage. Murdoch has rarely talked about his warring family or his relations with Elisabeth. However, in July, in a cryptic tweet, he wrote: ‘Asked is my daughter friend of David Cameron? Don’t know, but hope not. Really not my business.’ Freud has been fiercely protective of his wife. When the London Evening Standard wrote a front-page story in 2011 about her selling Shine to her father’s 21st Century Fox for £415 million, giving her a personal profit of £130 million, Freud was so angry about the ‘Sold to Daddy’ headline, he threw a glass of wine over editor Geordie Greig (now editor of The Mail on Sunday), at a party. Last week it was announced that Ms Murdoch was preparing to stand down from Shine after 21st Century Fox said that it would merge it with companies including Endemol, the makers of Big Brother. The wine incident was not Freud’s only hot-headed social outburst. In 2010 he was at Annabel’s nightclub in Mayfair when actor Hugh Grant was asked if he would like to meet Freud – even though they had a history going back 20 years. Grant declined and is said to have used an expletive about Freud. The PR guru, who was within earshot, then smeared chocolate cake down Grant’s shirt, and Grant punched Freud in the face. Despite such occasional volatile outbursts, Freud is undoubtedly generous. Friends say that when first wife ‘Pidge’ broke up with Charles Spencer, Freud was ‘highly supportive’. They say he is a devoted father to the children he shares with both ‘Pidge’ and Elisabeth. Freud made his fortune from providing crisis management to the rich and famous. But his skills do not appear to extend to resolving crises in his own marriage.","Elisabeth Murdoch and Matthew Freud have been married for 13 years .

"When the Sydney mother of four brothers who fled Australia to join Islamic State (IS) militants received a one-line text message from her sons that they had arrived safely in Syria she thought it was a cruel joke. The message read: 'We made it to Bilad al-Sham, we will see you in Paradise.' It emerged on Saturday authorities had tracked the brothers - who lived in south-west Sydney - as far as Turkey and alerted the family last week. Scroll down for video . More Australians have slipped through the cracks and fled overseas to join the fight with Islamic State . But it was believed they had crossed the border and ended up in Bilad al-Sham - a region in Syria. Family friend and Muslim community leader Dr Jamal Rifi told AAP the family had thought the message was a joke. 'The family didn't know what to make of it... They got scared and deleted the SMS,' Dr Rifi said. The mother even went to Sydney airport the next day to pick up her sons who were meant to have been on a holiday in Thailand, but they never arrived. The sons, 17, 23, 25 and 28, are believed to be the latest group of young Australians who have joined IS militants in Syria. The mother has pleaded with them to come home, 9News reported. 'My sons, you are dear to us,' she said in a statement. 'You are good at heart. You have done nothing wrong. 'We want you back. I can't stop crying day and night. We love you all.' One of the boys had told his mother he won a trip to Thailand and was taking his brothers, who all lived at home with their parents in Sydney's western suburbs. It is understood the teen was studying for his HSC at a public high school and the older brothers had stable jobs before they left. Unlike some before them, the siblings were 'clean-skins' and had not been on any watch-lists that would have alerted immigration controls. Dr Rifi said the family had no inclination the boys were at risk of joining IS. 'The boys are simple boys,' he said. 'They are religiously involved but not hardline or radical.' Dr Rifi said social media was playing a big role in the recruitment of these young Sydney men but there had to be someone manipulating the situation face-to-face. '... and providing contact information through the networks and how to cross the border,' he said. The four boys, one of whom still attended school, lived at home with their teenage sister, according The Sunday Telegraph. Their family home have been searched by police. Earlier this week on Thursday, Australian Federal Police commissioner Neil Gaughan told a parliamentary committee that the group of four that managed to leave the country this week were 'not on anyone's radar', The Guardian reported. 'We got wind of it after the fact, but the fact is there are still people travelling,' said Gaughan, the national manager of counter-terrorism for the Australian Federal Police,' he said. Authorities argue they need more tools to monitor suspects and prevent them from being radicalised . Many foreign fighters have already left the country including Mohamed Elomar (pictured) Authorities were alerted last Saturday when the family contacted a member of a local community after they failed to hear from their boys since they fled the country, News Corp reported. On Saturday, Immigration Minister Scott Morrison confirmed the family was seeking his help but unfortunately, it was too late. 'Australia has lost yet another four young kids. This is why we are so adamant in trying to prevent people leaving to join these foreign fighters', Mr Morrison told The Daily Telegraph. It follows the disappearance of 'ginger' jihadist Abdullah Elmir from his Bankstown home in Sydney's south-west in June and made his way to the Middle East. The 17-year-old gained notoriety when he declared that ISIS will not stop their murderous campaign 'until the black flag is flying high in every single land' in the YouTube video. According to The Daily Telegraph, counter terrorism officers have been deployed to all Australian international airports. This comes just days ahead of the G20 summit to be held in Brisbane, which will be attended by a large number of world leaders. Khaled Sharrouf is also fighting with IS militants in the Middle East, and made headlines when he posted a photo of his young son brandishing a severed head . Australian Federal Police commissioner Neil Gaughan speaking at the investigation into new legislation in Canberra on Thursday . Police commissioner Neil Gaughan also told the committee he believed federal police officers needed greater controls urgently, so they were better able to track the movements and interactions of suspects. 'But the fact is there’s still people travelling and regardless of what we’re doing, we’re not stopping that so we need some other tools,' he said, according to the Telegraph. Though he did not reveal from where or to what destination the group travelled, Gaughan said officers are now virtually powerless to stop them unless they resurface elsewhere. 'Unfortunately, once they get into Syria or into Iraq, there is nothing the AFP can do except wait for them to basically pop their head up somewhere on the way back.' Gaughan was speaking at an investigation into new legislation which aims to give security agencies power to issue control orders on people who are enabling or supporting terrorism. He also revealed that authorities were struggling to keep up with the sheer number of people being radicalised in such a short time - often less than six months. Authorities said the ability to put restrictions on who suspects can communicate with and where they can go would allow them to greatly reduce the change of an attack on home soil. There are now more than 60 Australians known to be fighting in foreign conflicts.","Four brothers from Sydney's south-west left Australia to travel to Syria .

"Roberto Martinez has called criticism of Arsene Wenger 'incredible' but is aiming to turn up the pressure on Arsenal's under-scrutiny manager. While Wenger endured a week to forget in Europe, Martinez and Everton found some form with a 3-1 dismantling of Young Boys Berne setting up a Europa League last 16 clash against Dynamo Kiev. Monaco's 3-1 victory at The Emirates has put Arsenal on the brink of Champions League elimination and plunged Wenger back into the spotlight but Martinez feels the criticism is baseless. Everton boss Roberto Martinez has called criticism of Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger 'unbelievable' The Gunners boss has been heavily criticised after his side fell to a 3-1 defeat against Monaco on Wednesday . Romelu Lukaku, pictured celebrating his second goal against Young Boys, has the potential to go right to the top according to his manager . Even still, he is aiming to give Wenger's detractors more ammunition by leading Everton to what would be just their second Barclays Premier League victory of 2015 on Sunday. 'You see the reaction and you see what Arsene Wenger has done and it is just incredible,' said Martinez. 'The way that he has changed the way we prepare teams in this country is unbelievable. 'He will be one of those managers that you will not appreciate how much you miss him until he has gone. He has got incredible experience. I just don't understand that sort of debate.' Everton have been progressing smoothly in the Europa League but their form in the Barclays Premier League needs to turn and Romelu Lukaku will have a key role in making that happen. The Belgian scored five times against Berne over two legs and Steven Naismith said: 'He has got great coaches behind him and the will to improve. He'll definitely do all he can to get at the top.'","Arsenal face Everton at The Emirates on Sunday afternoon .

"The devastating impact of typhoon Saola was captured on CCTV when a man was swallowed by a sinkhole after rain-sodden road beneath him gave way. The startling footage shows the Taiwanese pedestrian walking along a street in Tapei on Wednesday morning when suddenly the section of road opens like a trapdoor, pulling the man downwards. According to CNN the incident happened near the Temple of Sansha. Unaware: A man walks along the street in Tapei near the Temple of Sansha yesterday morning . Gone: A split-second later the sodden ground suddenly opens up and the man falls into the giant hole that has emerged . Torrential rain caused flooding and landslides across Taiwan today - killing five people and injuring 15 as Typhoon Saola skirted the island's east and north coasts heading towards China. The military helped more than 1,000 people flee from the less-populated mountainous north and east of the island while main cities including the capital, Taipei, shut down as more than five feet of rain battered the country. Normally busy streets in the capital were deserted except for cleanup crews clearing off trees and branches felled by the storm overnight. The Defense Ministry mobilized 48,000 soldiers to help mitigate the storm's impact.

Earlier in the day in the northeastern county of Ilan, rescuers were using rubber boats and amphibious vehicles to help hundreds escape flooded homes. They were also seeking to locate at least six stranded residents, cut off from the rest of their farming community when flood waters overwhelmed a small bridge. About 100 domestic and international flights were cancelled, train services disrupted with schools, shops and roads were closed. The National Fire Agency said that five people had been killed, including a policeman who drowned in a swollen river, and 15 others injured. Two people are still missing.

"From pulling petals off daisies to counting letters in people’s names, people have used many dubious methods to work out whether they have a future with someone they fancy. But now a new home test claims to tell the difference between a fleeting fling and a relationship that could mean a couple live happily ever after, by using a combination of genetic and psychological tests. The kit offers an ‘affordable way to test chemistry and compatibility long before a life-changing commitment is made, between a couple,’ according to Ontario, Canada-based firm, Instant Chemistry, which devised the tests. Happily ever after? Instant Chemistry, a new home test, (pictured) claims to tell the difference between a fleeting fling and an enduring relationship using a combination of genetic and psychological tests . The CAD$149 (£81) test comprises two ‘quick and non-invasive’ tests. Instant Chemistry collects a DNA sample from an individual  using a cheek swab and identifies the genetic make-up of part of their major histocompatibility complex (MHC/HLA) and serotonin uptake transporter (5-HTTLPR). Both people in the relationship must stow their spit in provided tubes and send the samples to the company so that it can analyse DNA. The results are shown in an ‘IC BioCompatibilty Score’ which is used to assess the person’s compatibility with other individuals based on their IC BioCompability Score. Analysis of the genetic make-up of two individuals can help determine whether they will experience physical attraction and compatibility when they meet for the first time. Or if the couple is already together this assessment can help determine strengths and weaknesses in overall compatibility in order to improve relationship success, the company said. Scientists test for six gene variants in the HLA system that are associated with increased physical attraction and relationship success. They also analyse ‘serotonin uptake transporter,’ which is associated with emotional response and marital success. Couples who have taken the test can log in to a secure online portal, complete the personality test and look at their compatibility results. The company claims to have come up with the first ever at-home compatibility test that is backed by scientific and psychological research – but it comes at a cost of CAD$149 (US$164; £81). The kit comprises three tests including one that compares the genetic strands of two people to report on their long-term compatibility and chemistry. ‘Through intensive research scientists have found that long-term relationship satisfaction stems from two constants – your DNA and core personality – and how those match up with your partners,’ said Dr Sara Seabrooke, chief science officer of Instant Chemistry. ‘The science behind Instant Chemistry’s kits is based on this research. By combining biological and psychological tests, we can determine how compatible you are with your partner and provide ways to offset incompatibilities, for example changing a small habit.’ The Couples Kit contains two biological tests, one based on relationship satisfaction and the other on long-term chemistry. The . Relationship Satisfaction test, which is backed by research from . University of California, Berkeley, determines how two people’s brains . process serotonin, revealing differences in their emotional reactions to . varying situations. Serotonin is associated with relationship success and marital success. The . second biological test, called Long-Term Chemistry, is based on 20 . years of research and looks at how well partners’ genetic makeup . complements each other. People taking the test send away a sample of their spit and let the scientists carry out the two biological tests, as well as taking an online personality test. They can log in to the company's website to see how they are compatible in different ways - an example is pictured . The kit comprises three tests including one that compares the genetic strands of two people to report on their long-term compatibility and chemistry. Artwork of DNA is pictured . This information can be used to look at key components of DNA, such as how partners react to scent - a proven way to determine how physically attracted partners will be years from now, the firm explained. Finally, a couple can do an online psychological compatibility test to identify each other’s personality traits and what they mean in terms of stability and happiness in a relationship. ‘Combined with the biological tests, Instant Chemistry is able to determine the underlying compatibility of partners and recognise what will help a relationship to further grow,’ the company claims. If compatibility is lacking, Instant Chemistry provides ways to detect conflict before it arises and advice on ways to improve a relationship. Wedding bells? 'Combined with the biological tests, Instant Chemistry is able to determine the underlying compatibility of partners, and recognise what will help a relationship to further grow,' the company claims.

"Yemen says it has foiled an audacious Al . Qaeda plot to blow up oil pipelines and seize key ports, as US special . operations forces reportedly prepare for action in the country. Security forces thwarted a plan by terrorists to take over oil and gas export facilities and a provincial . capital in the eastern part of the country, a government official said . today. Rajeh Badi, press advisor to Yemeni Prime Minister Mohammed Salem Basindwa, said the plot involved dozens of Al Qaeda militants dressed in Yemeni army uniforms storming the facilities on the night of the 27th of the Muslim month of Ramadan, which was on Sunday. The plot was apparently discovered after . US intelligence officers intercepted a conference call between senior . leaders of Al Qaeda. Scroll down for video . Sanaía International Airport in Sanaía, Yemen: American and British diplomatic staff were urged to leave Yemen before news of the foiled terror plot emerged today . The political temperature has hotted up in the Yemen in recent days and there is a heavier military presence on the streets . More than 20 operatives were involved in . the call, which mainly involved Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, and . Nasser al-Wuhayshi, the leader of Al Qaeda’s affiliate based in Yemen, . according to The Daily Beast. Badi said: 'The plot aimed to seize . the al-Dabbah oil export terminal in Hadramout [province] and the Belhaf . gas export facility, as well as the city of Mukalla [Hadramout . provincial capital].' He said the bid was prevented by . Yemeni forces deploying extra troops around the targeted facilities and . banning anyone from entering.[related] . News of the foiled plot emerged after the United States evacuated some . American diplomatic staff out of Yemen and told nationals to leave the . country immediately after warnings of potential attacks that had . prompted Washington to shut missions across the Middle East. Britain, France, the Netherlands and Norway also closed their embassies . in Sanaa and some evacuated their staff.

Exodus: Western citizens make their way to the airport after the State Department ordered the evacuation of all non-essential personnel . Bomb fear: Al Qaeda terrorists may have developed a new liquid explosive that can be applied to clothing and is completely undetectable by current airport security systems . Yemen, one of the poorest Arab . countries, is the base for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), one . of the most active branches of the network founded by Osama bin Laden, . and militants have launched attacks from there against the West. It emerged today that officials are . investigating the theory that Al Qaeda terrorists could try to bring . down planes using an undetectable explosive soaked into their clothes. The . organisation’s bomb-makers are reportedly developing an ‘ingenious’ system whereby shirts and trousers drenched in the explosive could be . ignited when dry. Mastermind: The new explosive is believed to be the work Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri known as Al-Qaeda's bomb-maker in chief . It would . be undetectable under current security measures and remove the need for . terrorists to mix liquid explosives on board, security sources told the . American TV network ABC News yesterday. The latest threat to air passengers is . one of the reasons behind the current global terror alert, according to . two senior US government officials. British bomb expert Sidney Alford . confirmed that the new method was possible using easily available . chemicals, but pulling it off would be tricky as the soaking process . would dilute the explosive. He said: ‘The clothes act as a diluent and reduce the power of the explosives.’ However, igniting treated clothes . could be done simply with a match. Passengers are allowed to carry a . single box of safety matches or a cigarette lighter on flights. The new explosive has reportedly been . developed by the notorious bomb-maker Ibrahim al-Asiri of Al Qaeda in . the Arabian Peninsula, who made the device used by convicted ‘underwear . bomber’ Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab in his attempt to blow up a plane on . Christmas Day in 2009. Other reports have suggested that Al-Asiri is developing bombs that could be sewn under the skin of terrorists. The level of ‘terror chatter’ being . monitored by security services has been described as one of the most . serious threats to American and Western interests since the 9/11 . attacks. In response, the Foreign Office last . night evacuated all staff from the British embassy in Yemen. The U.S. State Department, based at the White House, Washington (pictured), has instructed its embassies and consulates in the Muslim word that would normally be open on Sunday to close this weekend amid reports of an unspecified threat . Checkpoint: A policeman searches a car at a post close to the U.S. embassy in Sanaa, Yemen . Those . posted in Sana’a, the capital – including ambassador Jane Marriott, who . has only been there a month – were told to return to the UK because of . ‘increased security concerns’. The US also ordered all non-essential . personnel at its Yemeni embassy to get out, and American citizens still . in the country were flown to safety by military aircraft. Dozens of Al Qaeda operatives are said . to have streamed into Sana’a in the past few days, forcing the . country’s military to use ‘extraordinary and unprecedented’ security . measures to protect official buildings. At the same time, at least four . suspected terrorists have been killed in an American drone strike in the . eastern Marib region of Yemen. The drone fired a missile at a car carrying the four men, setting it on fire and killing all of them, the officials said. On Sunday  20 US embassies and consulates were closed after conversations between two senior al-Qaeda figures. The U.S. Embassy in Amman (pictured), the capital of Jordan, is among those closed . In Kabul, Afghanistan, where thousands of U.S. troops remain stationed, the U.S. Embassy (pictured) will also be closed this Sunday . Speaking . on condition of anonymity because they are not allowed to talk to the . media, the officials said they believe one of the dead is Saleh Jouti, a . senior Al Qaeda member. It's the fourth drone attack in the past week to hit a car believed to be carrying Al Qaeda members. On . Sunday  20 US embassies and consulates were closed after conversations . between two senior al-Qaeda figures, including top leader Ayman . al-Zawahiri,  were intercepted. Western embassies in the capital of Sanaa are also being protected. The State Department said in a travel . warning that it had ordered the departure of non-emergency U.S. government personnel from Yemen 'due to the continued potential for . terrorist attacks' and said U.S. citizens in Yemen should leave . immediately because of an 'extremely high' security threat level. 'As . staff levels at the Embassy are restricted, our ability to assist U.S. citizens in an emergency and provide routine consular services remains . limited and may be further constrained by the fluid security situation,' the travel warning said. Electronic communications were picked up several weeks ago . between Ayman al-Zawahri (left) - the head of the global terror network who . succeeded Osama bin Laden - and Nasser al-Wuhayshi (right) The BBC reports that the White House and the US state department say the current threat comes from al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), but have refused to release further details. The UK Foreign Office said in a statement: 'Due to increased security concerns, all staff in the British embassy have been temporarily withdrawn and the embassy will remain closed until staff are able to return.' Several European countries have also temporarily shut missions in Yemen. Known as Al-Qaeda's bomb-maker in chief, Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri is believed to be behind a range of explosive devices including pant bombs and liquid explosive implants which contain no metal parts making them virtually undetectable. Al-Asiri, 31, who is linked to the Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) group, was reported to have recruited his own brother Abdullah al-Asiri as a suicide bomber in a failed 2009 attempt to assassinate Saudi Arabia's Deputy Minister of the Interior. An early version of his pant bomb was used in the the 2009 Christmas Day bomb plot, when a Nigerian man attempted unsuccessfully to detonate the device aboard a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. An updated version, which incorporated fail-safe triggers and used a new kind of explosive that was even harder to detect was supplied for a terrorist attack in May last year to mark the anniversary of Osama Bin Laden’s death. That plot was foiled when the suicide bomber turned out to be a double agent and handed the device to the FBI . He is also believed to have been behind an intercepted pair of explosives-laden printers that were mailed from Yemen to the U.S. in 2010. In September last year he was reported as having been possibly killed in a drone strike together with other AQAP suspects but a Yemeni government official later denied the claim. He is currently considered to be one of America's most wanted men. 'He’s the main guy,' said one counterterrorism official. 'He’s the top of any list.' Al-Asiri has been described as a critical component of al Qaeda's activities in Yemen and his death would be a significant blow to the organization.","Security forces uncovered plans for an attack in the poorest Arab country .

"The grand jury that did not indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson was focused on whether he might have acted in self-defense when he shot and killed unarmed teenager Michael Brown. But the case raises another question: Could Wilson have avoided getting into a spot where he had to make that split-second, life-or-death decision? Departments around the country have in recent years stepped up their training in de-escalation — the art of defusing a tense situation with a word or a gesture instead of reaching for a weapon. Scroll down for video . Protests:  U.S. police departments around the country have in recent years stepped up their training in 'de-escalation' the art of defusing a tense situation with a word or a gesture instead of being confrontational . Calm: Ferguson police officers try to calm down a crowd near the scene where 18-year-old Michael Brown was fatally shot by a police officer . Shooting: Police are trying to learn lessons in the wake of Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson (left) for shooting dead Brown (right) It could, in fact be used in the future to better train police officers to calm situations down, particularly in the wake of Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson shooting dead Michael Brown. Supporters of a calmer police response include the Justice Department. They suggest that this will improve trust and understanding between police and residents, curtail the unnecessary use of force and improve the safety of officers and civilians alike. Cambridge, Massachusetts, Police Commissioner Robert Haas said: 'We haven't taught officers to just walk away.' 'But if the only reason a person is acting up is because you're standing there ... isn't that a viable approach?' Haas and other law enforcement officials said they didn't want to second-guess Wilson's actions because they weren't in his shoes at the time of the August 9 shooting. Aggressive: Police officers stand near a crowd gathering by the scene where 18-year-old Michael Brown was fatally shot by a police officer in Ferguson, in future officers may be trained to act with more restraint . But, many said, the case should accelerate a national discussion about police culture and the potential for broader training in de-escalation. This is considered to be especially important in dealing with people in mental health or drug-related crises. In Missouri this month, a federal law enforcement team held training with St. Louis-area police, including top commanders from Ferguson, on how unintentional bias affects police work. That approach goes hand-in-hand with de-escalation. Jenny Durkan, the former U.S. attorney in Seattle who led the effort to curb excessive uses of force by city police said it was important for each to consider the other's perspective. 'In every police encounter, the officer and the civilian bring with them and see the world through their experiences.' 'The more these views diverge, the more they immediately see the other as a threat.' According to Wilson's grand jury testimony, Brown and a friend were walking down the middle of the street when he drove up and asked them to use the sidewalk. When they declined, he suggested it again. Brown allegedly responded by cursing at him, according to Wilson said. He said he backed up his vehicle to confront Brown, who was carrying stolen cigars. Brown shoved the vehicle's door shut as Wilson tried to open it, and then attacked the officer through the door's open window, Wilson said. The officer began shooting, then got out of the car, chased Brown, and fired some more when Brown turned around. 'My job isn't to just sit and wait,' Wilson told ABC News. Solemn: Six members of Michael Brown's family sit around the table in Ferguson on Thursday night and set out a seat for the slain teen at Thanksgiving dinner . In its investigations of police agencies, the Justice Department has singled out poor de-escalation tactics. In a July report on the Newark, New Jersey, department, the DOJ faulted a 'pattern and practice of taking immediate offensive action. This was done rather than acting within the bounds of the Constitution and displaying the 'thick skin and patience' needed for the job. In Seattle and in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the DOJ blasted police for too quickly using flashlights, batons or stun guns as weapons when force could have been avoided. In Seattle in 2010, an officer killed a Native American woodcarver who had crossed the street while holding a small knife and a block of wood. The officer got out of his car, and when the carver — who turned out to be hard of hearing — didn't immediately drop the tool as ordered, he was shot. Like Wilson, the officer wasn't charged criminally because of the high bar for such prosecutions against police, but the case helped spur the federal civil rights investigation of the department. Protests: Protests raged in  Ferguson as people reacted to the death of the teenager . Heavy handed: Police wearing riot gear point their weapons before arresting a man in Ferguson . A consent decree overhauled the department's training, putting a premium on de-escalation and bias-free policing. The DOJ has already launched a similar investigation in Ferguson. Seattle police spokesman Sean Whitcomb said in practice, de-escalation can take many forms. Sometimes it means that multiple officers respond rather than one, because the larger presence can make excitable subjects realize they're outnumbered. But for an officer, it can also mean calmly introducing yourself, listening to what someone is saying and simply relating to the person. The use of body-worn cameras can also help, experts say, because both officers and civilians tend to behave better when they know they're being recorded. 'If we can use language and presence to get people to comply with lawful orders, we can consider that a win,' Whitcomb said. Still, reducing tension can be easier said than done. In a 2012 report from the Police Executive Research Forum it describes challenges in utilizing de-escalation techniques. It said a younger generation of officers accustomed to communicating through text messaging and social media may be less adept in the personal communication skills needed. And some officers worry about giving away the upper hand. A group of Seattle police officers sued over the department's new use-of-force policy. They said while they too want to prevent excessive uses of force, the policy is overly complicated and could endanger officers by requiring them to hesitate before using force. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit, but the officers have appealed. 'Traditional police training reinforces that you must always display a very strong, assertive presence,"" said Sue Rahr, executive director of Washington state's police academy. 'But if the officer reacts to a challenge as most human beings would — by challenging back — the situation is going to devolve.'","Departments around the country are training officers in de-escalation .

"A rabbi on a seaside holiday accidentally drowned while performing his daily ritual bathing in the sea. Jewish Orthodox Dov Berish Englander, 47, got into difficulties while performing a mikveh - a full body immersion in water to gain ritual purity. The rabbi was on holiday from London and staying at the scenic seaside town of Aberystwyth in West Wales when tragedy struck. Tragic: Jewish Orthodox Dov Berish Englander, 47, was on holiday from London and staying at the scenic seaside town of Aberystwyth in West Wales when tragedy struck . Rabbi Englander walked in to the sea for an early morning ritual bath on Thursday, but soon got into difficulties. A guest at a hotel overlooking the bay rang 999 after seeing him struggling to stay afloat. A lifeboat and rescue helicopter were sent to the scene and lifeboat crew pulled the rabbi from the water. Emergency: A guest at the Glengower Hotel raised the alarm shortly after 08:00am on Thursday . Paramedics tried to resuscitate him but he was declared dead at Bronglais General Hospital, Aberystwyth. Rabbi Berish Englander, from Stamford Hill, north London, was described as 'highly respected' for his religious knowledge and charitable work. He was staying at the seaside resort of Aberystwyth - a popular destination for strictly Orthodox families. A member of the Jewish Orthodox community, who was on holiday in Aberystwyth and knew Rabbi Englander, paid tribute to him. Paramedics tried to resuscitate him but he was declared dead at Bronglais General Hospital, Aberystwyth . He said: 'He was an extremely righteous and very, very prominent and respected rabbi in our community. 'He was a good example to all. He was the kind of man you would take your children to meet, to use him as an example to the children. 'He was very kind and generous and gave an enormous amount of money to charity. He will be missed by everyone who knew him.' Police said they are not treating the incident as suspicious. In June, Satmar Chasid Rabbi Chaim Breisch died after struggling in a rough sea off Broadstairs, Kent.","Jewish Orthodox Dov Berish Englander, 47, got into difficulties while performing a mikveh - a full body immersion in water to gain ritual purity .

"'All dressed up with only a hotel room to go to' was the provocative theme for Marc Jacob's autumn/winter 2013 catwalk spectacle for Louis Vuitton. And in a three minute promotional video for the collection, entitled 'Ladies of the Night', models Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne and Georgia May Jagger are seen posing along the Rue du Pont Neuf in Paris in the most minimal pieces. Now the video has come under fire by a leading French daily newspaper for 'promoting prostitution'. 'It is an extremely shocking representation of women,’ said Dominique Attias, a leading lawyer who signed a letter criticising Louis Vuitton published in French left-wing newspaper Libération. Scroll down for video . Model of the moment Cara Delevingne is seen provocatively walking the streets at night in the new short film . The model in heels and a fur coat poses seductively against a wall . Georgia May Jagger also stars in the night-time video, wearing a Louis Vuitton lingerie dress . The letter published in the newspaper with a circulation of over 140,000 slammed the Gallic fashion . house for 'assimilating luxury with the world’s second most profitable . criminal activity after drug trafficking'. It was also signed by Chantal . Jouanno, a former centre-right minister, Laurence Rossignol, a Socialist . Senator, and the Scelles Foundations Against Sexual Exploitation, . reported the Times. Accompanied by haunting piano music, the . film shows Cara walking the dark streets of Paris as if waiting to be . picked up or on a 'walk of shame' home. Meanwhile model Magdelena Frackowiak . flashes her derriere as she walks down a Parisian alley in just a fur . coat and heels while other raunchy scenes see a model flashing her chest . in the back of a car. The short film also stars a a scantily-clad Edie Campbell, Saskia de . Brauw, Isabeli Fontant and Lily McMenamy as it cuts from the outdoor . scenes to the models stomping on to the . catwalk in this season's Paris Fashion Week show. There was a melancholy note to Marc Jaconbs' autumn/winder 2013 show at Paris Fashion Week showcasing his new collection. It encapsulated, in the designer's own words, 'an attitude of getting dressed up only to find the most glamorous destination is one's own hotel room', reported Grazia. The film shows the models in the sexy new range and various states of undress in the Paris streets . Mrs Attias said Louis Vuitton had . 'portrayed women’s bodies as an object and prostitution as something . that is playful and enjoyable'. 'This is very damaging because we are . trying to fight the idea, to which some young women in France . subscribe, that prostitution is banal, and just a way of getting money . to buy some new clothes,' she said. Louis Vuitton has declined to comment . on the controversy, however the Times reported that a source close to . the fashion house said that it had never authorised the prostitution . video. The film was made for Love, the . British fashion magazine edited by Katie Grand, a stylist who works as a . consultant for Louis Vuitton. Grand told Grazia magazine: 'I knew the character was [director James Lima's] kind of woman, she was French and a lady that enjoys the night time.' A credit at the end of the video . offers 'special thanks' to Mr Jacobs, implying that he approved it, . although the source in Paris claimed that was not the case. The video circulated on the internet as Jacobs announced that he had taken a role as a pornography baron in a movie, Disconnect. Mrs Attias described the video as . 'devastating for the image of women' but also criticised Louis Vuitton’s . Paris show, which featured models in what appeared to be hotel . corridors. 'What indecency, what ignorance, what . indifference to play with the fantasy of chic pornography: the social . condition of the immense majority of people who prostitute themselves is . in no way enviable, and in no way happy.

"A substitute teacher at a Chicago school addressed a group of 13-year-olds using the N-word and referring to them as 'slaves'. Mea Thompson and three of her friends say the teacher at first referred to them as 'African-American', which the girls objected to as they are not of African heritage. The female teacher then used the N-word, which the group claim she then repeated throughout the class, referring to them as 'slaves'. Shocked: Eighth-grade-students Mea Thompson and Zaria Daniel say the substitute teacher called them the N-word during a social studies class at their school in a Chicago suburb . The incident took place at a middle school in Carol Stream, a suburb to Chicago, earlier this week. Four students, all 13, say they were busy working on a project about the Cold War during a social studies class headed by the teacher. The students say the teacher approached them and referred to them as ‘African-American’ ‘All four of us that were sitting there got offended because none of us are from Africa. I’m Jamaican. So we said, “Can you please not call us that?”’ Mea Thompson told NBC. ‘She continued to call us that and said, “It’s the politically correct term.” Then she said, “Well, back then you guys would be considered the N-word”.’ Following complaints, the substitute teacher was interviewed about the incident and confirmed the girls claims were true . According to Thompson and classmate Zaria Daniel, the teacher used the N-word throughout the class and referred to the group as 'slaves'. The girls say one student left the classroom in tears. Following the girls’ complaints, the substitute teacher was interviewed about the incident and confirmed that what the girls claimed was true. A spokesperson for the school district has said the teacher will not be asked back to the school.

"This weekend sees the first blockbuster sporting weekend of 2015 with football, rugby, boxing, and cricket all on the agenda. Fancy doing a 24 hour marathon of watching all the sport? Well, Sportsmail has put together a guide of how to do just that. Good luck. Saturday 28 February . 10.30pm Carl Frampton vs Chris Avalos . The 24 hours of sport starts with the super-bantamweight fight between Carl ‘The Jackal’ Frampton and American challenger Chris Avalos. The fight is live on ITV which is a boost for the sport as there is potential for a wider audience. Carl Frampton (centre) will be  defending his IBF super-bantamweight world title vs Chris Avalos on Saturday . 10pm - 6am England vs Sri Lanka . Once the ‘Fighting Pride of Belfast’ has kept his unbeaten record intact (hopefully), switch over to Sky Sports' World Cup channel and watch Eoin Morgan’s England face Sri Lanka in Wellington. Unless Frampton gets the job done early, then you are likely to miss a few overs, and if England are batting then maybe a few wickets. But after two defeats in a row for England, they got back on track against Scotland. Now they will look for a second win to push them closer to a place in the quarter finals. If the worst happens and England collapse then you may have a chance for a full fry up, but just a bowl of cereal if this goes the distance. England will be hoping to secure their second win at the Cricket World Cup when they face Sri Lanka . Sunday 1 March . 6am to 7.30am – Either 90 minutes of shut-eye or just have a hearty breakfast to set you up for a return to the sofa . 7.30am - 9am Match of the Day repeat . With live sport dominating proceedings on Saturday night, it was inevitable that there would have to be a sacrifice, but worry not, as Match of the Day is back on BBC1 on Sunday morning. So if you have managed to avoid finding out the scores from Burnley vs Swansea and Stoke vs Hull then now is the chance to catch up and watch the highlights with Gary and the boys. Or, if you fancy something different, Sportsmail's Neil Ashton hosts Sunday Supplement on Sky Sports 1 from 8am. Match of the Day will be repeated on BBC 1 during Sunday morning if you miss it on Saturday night . 9am - 12noon filler Pakistan vs Zimbabwe/Valencia vs Real Sociedad/make a sandwich . If you are really determined to see through a full 24 hours of sport, then you will have to choose between World Cup cricket or La Liga action for your next helping. David Moyes takes his Real Sociedad side to Valencia, in what will be a tough test for the former Manchester United manager against a  side pushing for the Champions League. Pakistan go into their game with Zimbabwe bottom of Pool B and without a win from their two games. Zimbabwe have not fared much better, with their only win coming against UAE. There is plenty of time to make a midday snack to keep you going. Pakistan (left) go into their Cricket World Cup clash against Zimbabwe sitting bottom of Group B and winless . 12noon - 2pm Liverpool vs Man City . The real action gets going at midday when two of the Premier League’s heavyweights meet at Anfield. Both Manchester City and Liverpool suffered disappointing defeats in Europe in the week and will want to respond with a good performance in the Premier League. With Chelsea not in league action this weekend, City know a win will see them cut the lead at the top of the table to two points. While Liverpool will want to narrow the gap between them and the top four. Liverpool and Manchester City will both want to forget their European hangovers when they meet on Sunday . Worried someone might interrupt your weekend of sport by trying to watch the EastEnders omnibus? Worry no more with this brilliant case which is being given away on Twitter by Capital One. Click here for more information and follow @CapitalOneUK . 2pm - 4pm Arsenal vs Everton/Norwich vs Ipswich . There will hardly be any time to put the kettle on between the two Premier League games, because as soon the game finishes at Anfield then Arsenal will be kicking off against Everton in London. The Toffees may be England’s last representatives in the Europa League, but they are struggling domestically. In fact they have not won at Arsenal since January 1996. To give you some idea how long ago that was, it was the same week that George Michael’s Jesus to a Child knocked Michael Jackson’s Earth Song off the top of the charts. Make sure your batteries in your remote control are fully charged because they will be working overtime. If you fancy a break from the Premier League then flick over to Sky Sports 3 and watch a very tasty East Anglia derby between Norwich and Ipswich. Both teams a going well and pushing for a promotion with the Tractor Boys just one point above the Canaries. With the top of the Championship so tight, a result in this game could go a long way to deciding which side is better placed for promotion. Olivier Giroud (second right) scored a late equaliser as Arsenal drew at Everton in the reverse game this term . 3pm - 5pm Ireland vs England . There will be more channel hopping required here as this will be the busiest part of the day, because over in Dublin the two unbeaten sides in the Six Nations go head to head when Ireland face England. With the Grand Slam up for grabs both sides will be determined to win, and for England it will be a chance to get revenge for missing out on the title last year as Ireland triumphed. George Ford will prove a key player for England if they are to beat Ireland in their Six Nations clash on Sunday . 4pm - 6pm Capital One Cup final . Next to Wembley and there is more channel hopping required. Stick with the rugby on BBC1 if England are winning or switch to Sky Sports 1 for Capital One Cup final if they are losing. London rivals Chelsea and Tottenham go head to head for the first piece of domestic silverware of the season. Jose Mourinho is yet to win a trophy in his second spell at Chelsea and is desperate to put a cup in the trophy cabinet. Spurs have already beaten Chelsea this season and will hope for a repeat of the 2008 final when the north London side came out on top thanks to a Jonathan Woodgate winner. Jonathan Woodgate's goal gave Tottenham a 2-1 win vs Chelsea after extra-time in the 2008 League Cup final . 6pm - 8pm Sevilla vs Atletico Madrid/dinner . Had your fill of English football? Luckily Sevilla v Atletico Madrid is served up next on Sky Sports 5. You would be forgiven for taking a break to make some food at this point, but this should be a decent game between third and fifth. After the Capital One Cup final the attention switches over to Spain where Atletico Madrid travel to Sevilla . 8pm - 10pm Real Madrid vs Villarreal / PSG /Monaco . Finish off the marathon with Real Madrid vs Villarreal on Sky Sports 5. If you are in danger of nodding off then Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale are sure to keep you awake a little longer. But once that is done, go to bed, you deserve it and more than likely have work in the morning! Your Sunday evening viewing is concluded with the option of watching Real Madrid host Villarreal at 8pm .","Carl Frampton fights Chris Avalos for the IBF super-bantamweight title .

"Three hunters are trying to make amends for causing an outcry after they killed a rare albino moose considered sacred by the indigenous Mi'kmaq people. The hunters, who have not been named, shot the animal in the Cape Breton Highlands of Nova Scotia in Canada during a recent trip to the area. They claim they did not realise that their trophy would spark outrage among the Mi'kmaq, who believe albino creatures to be 'spirit' animals. Backlash: The indigenous Mi'kmaq communities in Nova Scotia, Canada, are incensed that hunters shot this moose recently. The hunters originally posted this photo on Facebook. Since the backlash, it has been taken down . Slaughter: The hunters have apologized and are trying to make amends for killing the rare albino moose considered sacred by the indigenous Mi'kmaq people . Their calamitous error was spotted by Jim Hnatiuks, when the trio brought the carcass of the dead creature . into his hunting and taxidermy store in Lantz for it to be mounted. He said: 'The hunters are saying ""we wouldn’t have shot the moose if we had known it meant that much."" 'They thought they had a . successful moose hunt. It was odd that they shot a white moose, but to . find out ""wow"", there’s a lot more behind it.' Mr Hnatiuks insisted the hunters were unaware of the implications of killing the rare Spirit Moose. Blunder: Their calamitous error was spotted by Jim Hnatiuks, when the trio brought the carcass of the dead creature into his hunting and taxidermy store in Lantz for it to be mounted . They are returning the hide so the Mi’kmaq can perform a sacred ceremony. Chief . Bob Gloade, of the Millbrook First Nation, said: 'We’ve received full . cooperation from the hunters and from Mr Hnatiuks as well and, during . the ceremonies next week, they’re actually willing to participate. First Nation communities voiced their anger after photos of the hunters posing with the moose appeared on social media. Mr Hnatiuks is now acting on behalf of . the hunters to ensure the moose is disposed of in a manner . considered respectful by the Mi'kmaq. Sacred: Albino creatures are considered to be spirits by the indigenous Mi'kmaq people . 'It shows a willingness to cooperate and an ability to show respect to not only the Mi’kmaq people but also to the culture and history.' While it is not illegal to shoot a white moose . during the hunting season the Mi'kmaq believe it breaks an unwritten rule surrounding a cultural belief held by them for generations. Mr Gloade said the only protection open for the sacred animals is tradition, but he is hoping for legislation to protect spirit animals from being hunted. He added: 'To recognise the importance and significance to the Mi’kmaq people is the next step moving forward and it’s a way of building better relationships between the aboriginal and non-aboriginal community.'","The 'spirit moose' was shot during a hunting trip to Cape Breton Highlands .

"Live gaffe: BBC radio football commentator Brenner Woolley branded Ipswich Town fans the 'great unwashed' in a live broadcast of the Blues' 2-1 win over Wolves . A BBC radio football commentator who branded Ipswich Town fans the 'great unwashed' in a live broadcast has been forced to apologise. Brenner Woolley, who's reported on Ipswich games for more than 10 years at the station, scored his embarrassing own goal when he thought he was off air. He made the howler in the half-time break in the clubs' 2-1 win over Wolves at Portman Road on Tuesday night (Nov 4). But Woolley's derogatory comment was picked up by supporters listening to the online worldwide live match commentary service provided by team's 'Player' service on the club's website. They were not broadcast over the normal airwaves. Nick Gibbs, editor of The Ibiza Sun newspaper, said Woolley blundered as he discussed the post-match telephone call-in show with co-commentator and ex-England star Mick Mills. Mr Gibbs, who was listening in, said Mr Woolley said: 'I'll give you these headphones at full-time so you can hear the great unwashed!' He said their chat, supposed to be private, could be heard for about 10 minutes during the half-time interval. Other angry fans, known as the Tractor Boys, have called for the broadcaster to  apologise at the next game. One, named Martyn wrote on Twitter: 'I think Brenner Woolley should be made to stand in the middle of the pitch, at halftime on Saturday, and apologise to the fans.' BBC Radio Suffolk have confirmed that Woolley used the term 'great unwashed'. A BBC Radio Suffolk spokesman said: 'We have spoken to Brenner and made clear to him that these comments are unacceptable. 'Brenner accepts this and has apologised.' Ipswich fans, known as the Tractor Boys, have called for commentator Brenner Woolley to apologise on the pitch after he branded them the 'great unwashed' in an on air blunder (file picture) Brenner Woolley made the half time blunder as Michael Jacobs of Wolverhampton Wanders took on Tyrone Ming of Ipswich on the pitch . The station is thought to have launched an urgent investigation into the blunder. Woolley joined BBC Radio Suffolk from Sheffield-based Hallam FM in 2001. Managed by Mick McCarthy Ipswich Town Football Club was founded in 1878 and play in the Football League Championship. The club's fans are known as the Tractor Boys. Mr Gibbs said he did not take Woolley's comments 'too seriously'. Brenner Woolley has angered Ipswich Town fans after branding them the 'great unwashed' during a live broadcast . 'It was good half-time entertainment and, aside from hearing Norwich were losing, was better than the usual half-time round-ups. 'I was hoping Mick Mills would start singing along to the Tannoy music but alas he must have been eating his sandwiches. 'Football call-in shows are renowned for attracting some pretty odd characters and if that's the worst name they get called 'off-air' they've got off pretty lightly,' he laughed. 'That said, if you make a gaffe in the media you deserve a bit of banter back. 'The Ipswich Town Player is a great service enabling those of us around the world to listen to Radio Suffolk's live match commentaries. 'Perhaps in the next broadcast Brenner will say hello to the ITFC supporters branch in Ibiza, all eight of us, and the rest of Ipswich's 'great unwashed' around the world.'","Brenner Woolley has reported on Ipswich Town games for over 10 years .

"Allegations: Bo Xilai, who hoped to join the Chinese Communist Party's politburo in Beijing, has been accused of being involved in the death of Mr Heywood . The Chinese politician whose wife is accused of the alleged murder of British businessman Neil Heywood drew up three different cover stories for the planned killing of his own police chief, it has been claimed. Bo Xilai, then a rising star of the Chinese Communist Party who hoped to join its powerful politburo in Beijing, was apparently trying to prevent the police chief, Wang Lijun, from revealing that Mr Heywood had been murdered. Mr Wang took shelter at the US consulate in Chengdu in February, where he told diplomats that Mr Heywood was poisoned by Mr Bo's wife, Gu Kailai. The police chief reportedly told them Ms Gu had confessed to the killing. The . latest allegations against Mr Bo suggest that he was much more deeply . involved in silencing Mr Wang than was previously thought. Hong . Kong magazine New Way has claimed in an investigation that Mr Bo drew . up three false explanations to hide the planned killing of Mr Wang, . having already allegedly arrested and tortured several members of the . police chief's inner circle. Jiang . Weiping, a Chinese journalist now living in exile in Canada after being . jailed for reporting on Mr Bo, said details of the plot had been . confirmed to him by sources in Chongqing, the city where Mr Heywood was . allegedly murdered. Mr . Jiang told the Sunday Telegraph that Mr Bo invented scenarios to explain . Mr Wang's death and to play down any suggestions that he was involved. The first story was to blame the killing on the local mafia as revenge for police efforts to fight crime in the city. The second was to pretend Mr Wang had committed suicide to escape being punished for corruption. The third fake explanation was suicide caused by Mr Wang's depression. Accused: Bo Xilai's wife Gu Kailai (left) is said to have confessed to being present when British businessman Neil Heywood (right) was poisoned. The pair had allegedly had an affair . Questions: Chinese officials are investigating . whether Mr Heywood was poisoned with cyanide after falling out with Mr . Bo (right) and his wife Gu Kailai (left) Mr Bo opted for the third . explanation, the magazine claimed, because the first was too difficult . and the second would undermine his push for national power. His aides are said to have forged Mr Wang's medical history to suggest the police chief suffered from depression. They . are also believed to have leaked a supposed hospital certificate on the . internet in an attempt to spread the word that Mr Wang was mentally . unstable. The magazine . claimed that five members of Mr Wang's circle were interrogated - with . two of them dying under torture - and others were put under . surveillance. Mr Wang became aware that his life was in danger and went to the US consulate, the report continued. Chris . Johnson, the former chief analyst of the CIA, said: 'It does seem that . his intention was not to defect but to find a safe haven because he . realised that the gig was up in Chongqing and he needed to get out of . there as quickly as possible. 'For Bo's enemies, Wang is golden. It certainly won't just be Neil Heywood's death that he is telling them about.' The new allegations are the latest of many to emerge since Mr Heywood, 41, died in suspicious circumstances six months ago. The body of the Old Harrovian business ‘fixer’, who had known the Bo family for a decade, was found in a hotel in Chongqing last November. It has been alleged that he was murdered apparently to stop him disclosing secrets of Mr Bo's wealth transferred out of China. Suspicious: The reception area of the Nanshan . Lijing Holiday Hotel in Chongqing, China, where British businessman Neil . Heywood was found dead . Ms . Gu, who had allegedly had an affair with Mr Heywood, is said to have . told Mr Wang that she was in the hotel room during the ‘gruesome’ poisoning. Mr Wang reportedly told U.S. diplomats . that Mr Heywood was held down in a Chongqing hotel room in November and . forced to drink cyanide. Mr Heywood had, before his death, been raising cash to build an £80million shopping centre dedicated to British goods. Mrs . Gu is alleged to have started an affair with him after she was denied . ‘any normal passion’ from her husband, said Wang Kang, a Chongqing scholar . with contacts inside Mr Bo's circle. They . are even said to have visited Britain together and occasionally shared . an apartment in the seaside resort of Bournemouth, which was registered . to Mrs Gu. Target: Bo Xilai is said to have drawn up three cover stories for the planned killing of police chief Wang Lijun, pictured . Mr Heywood's death ended the political . career of Mr Bo, who was sacked from his post after it was claimed he . had wire-tapped senior Communist Party leaders. The wire-tapping network was reportedly discovered when anti-corruption . officials detected a phone call made to Chinese President Hu Jintao was . being bugged. Mr Bo's son Guagua read Politics, Philosophy and Economics at Oxford's Balliol College. He later studied at Harvard University in the U.S. but is now believed to be in hiding. Bo Guagua has tried to play down reports that he enjoyed a playboy lifestyle at Oxford. He said his academic record was ‘solid’ and he had earned a string of top grades.

"The newest version of Grand Theft Auto allows players to experience sex with a prostitute from a first-person perspective. What's more, players of the massively popular video game may also then beat the woman up. It's all made possible in the revamping of the 2013 game for the newer Playstation 4 and Xbox One consoles. Scroll down for video . Outrageous: The newest version of Grant Theft Auto V lets players have sex with a prostitute from a first-person perspective for the first time . Re-release: The re-release happened Tuesday and now makes the game available for PS4 and Xbox One console users and in first-person at the touch of a button . Even more shocking? Players also get to brutally murder their escorts in order to take back the money they paid for sexual services . Big $$$: The game made $1 billion in its first three days on the market last year, now makers Rockstar Games are looking to get even more out of the lucrative and always controversial game . Previous to this new version, which launched Tuesday, prostitutes did exist in the game, but the player's sexual encounters with them was not explicitly visible. Now, with new first-person mode, there's no hiding it. 'Picking up a prostitute in first person in Grand Theft Auto V is a legitimately upsetting experience,' wrote @AlecJKM on Twitter. And Alec wasn't the first, nor will he be the last, who will think so. Not with players' new ability to watch from behind the wheel of their stolen car as a prostitute performs oral sex on them. The player may then experience in first-person the act of having sex with that prostitute as she moans and says some very X-rated things. The icing on this controversial cake is the ability players have to then gruesomely murder their prostitute and take back their money. As shocking as all that may be, though, this isn't Rockstar Games' first time trying to gin up sales using sex and violence. The company has always offered players the chance to live like sex-crazed murder hungry criminals. And its always worked out quite well for them. Grand theft Auto is, after all, the best selling game of all time. In September of last year, after the first iteration of GTA 5 was released, it made a billion dollars in just three days. Players may  experience in first-person the act of having sex with that prostitute as she moans and says some very X-rated things. The game immediately became controversial after its Tuesday release, just as most previous versions of the game have . What will happen now that the game has become even more realistic? Rockstar probably had a good idea leading up to Tuesday's re-release. 'It's a very intense, in-your-face experience… literally,' says Rob Nelson, the Animation Director on GTA 5, told gaming site IGN. 'Obviously, we felt like one of the most compelling things you could do to make an experience people have had before feel different was the new first-person mode.' 'This new mode gives players the chance to explore the world of Los Santos and Blaine County directly through the eyes of their character, revealing all the world's glorious details in an entirely new way,' Rockstar said.","The scenes are reportedly in the new upgraded version of the $2billion game for Playstation 4 and Xbox One .

"President Obama has moved closer to military intervention in Syria, after stating that the alleged chemical attack by the Assad regime last week warranted a 'serious response.' Obama said time was running out for Assad to allow UN weapons inspectors to view the site of the alleged attack near Damascus, where as many as 1,300 people died on Wednesday. A government source said Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron agreed all options should be kept open, while taking a clear stance that the West will not abide by chemical weapon attacks on innocent civilians. WARNING: Graphic content . President Obama appeared on CNN's 'New Day' on Friday to discuss the alleged attack, saying it was a 'big event of grave concern' that requires American attention . 'They reiterated that significant use of . chemical weapons would merit a serious response from the international . community and both have tasked officials to examine all the options,' a British government spokesman told the Guardian. Obama had spoken at length to Cameron on Saturday, in a conversation that led him to believe Assad was most likely behind the chemical attack. His move towards a more serious response comes as four battleships move within striking range of Syria, which has been locked in a deadly civil war that has claimed more than 100,000 lives since 2011. Obama was said to be 'gravely concerned' by the attack and increasing signs that it was carried out against Syrians by Assad's forces. 'The fact that President Assad has failed to co-operate with the UN suggests that the regime has something to hide,' a spokesman said. The spokesman added that the President and Cameron, 'Reiterated that significant use of . chemical weapons would merit a serious response from the international . community'. 'They agreed that it is vital that the world upholds the prohibition on . the use of chemical weapons and deters further outrages.' The . tougher stance comes as U.S. defense secretary Chuck Hagel told . reporters in Kuala Lumpa that Obama was still considering whether to use . military force. He . said the Administration had to account for several factors, including . intelligence on the Syrian attack, legal issues and the level of . international support for a military response. Prepared: Chuck Hagel, right, says the President has ordered the Pentagon to prepare potential military options . Obama had previously warned a chemical attack would signify Assad had crossed a 'red line'. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel declined . to discuss specific force movements but said Obama had asked the . Pentagon to prepare military options for Syria. U.S. defense officials told The Associated Press that the Navy had sent a . fourth warship armed with ballistic missiles into the eastern . Mediterranean Sea but without immediate orders for any missile launch . into Syria. U.S. Navy ships . are capable of a variety of military actions, including launching . Tomahawk cruise missiles, as they did against Libya in 2011 as part of . an international action that led to the overthrow of the Libyan . government. 'The Defense . Department has a responsibility to provide the president with options . for contingencies, and that requires positioning our forces, positioning . our assets, to be able to carry out different options - whatever . options the President might choose,' Hagel told reporters traveling with . him to Asia. Hagel said the U.S. is coordinating . with the international community to determine 'what exactly did happen' near Damascus earlier this week. According to reports, a chemical attack in a suburb of the capital killed at least 100 people. It . would be the most heinous use of chemical weapons since Iraqi leader . Saddam Hussein gassed thousands of Kurds in the town of Halabja in 1988. Hagel . left little doubt that he thinks the attack in Syria involved chemical . weapons, although he stressed there is not yet a final answer. In discussing the matter, he said, 'it appears to be what happened - use of chemical weapons.' Escalation: Angela Kane, the UN's high representative for disarmament, arrives in Damascus, Syria on Saturday to press President Bashar Assad to let UN investigators look into the reported chemical attack . Four battleships have been moved to within striking range of Syria as President Obama weighs his options following a reported use of chemical weapons against citizens on Wednesday . UN . disarmament chief, Angela Kane, arrived in Damascus on Saturday to . press the Syrian government to allow UN experts to investigate the . alleged chemical attacks. Obama . remained cautious about getting involved in a war that has killed more . than 100,000 people and now includes Hezbollah and al-Qaeda. He made no mention of the 'red line' of chemical weapons use that he marked out for Syrian President Bashar . Assad a year ago and that U.S. intelligence says has been breached at . least on a small scale several times since. 'If . the U.S. goes in and attacks another country without a UN mandate and . without clear evidence that can be presented, then there are questions . in terms of whether international law supports it - do we have the . coalition to make it work?' Obama said Friday. 'Those are considerations . that we have to take into account.' Obama . conceded in an interview on CNN's 'New Day' program that the episode is . a 'big event of grave concern' that requires American attention. He . said any large-scale chemical weapons usage would affect 'core national . interests' of the U.S. and its allies. But nothing he said signaled a . shift toward U.S. action. U.S. defense officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss ship movements publicly. But . if the U.S. wants to send a message to Assad, the most likely military . action would be a Tomahawk missile strike, launched from a ship in the . Mediterranean. For a year . now, Obama has threatened to punish Assad's regime if it resorted to its . chemical weapons arsenal, among the world's vastest, saying use or even . deployment of such weapons of mass destruction constituted a 'red line' for him. A U.S. intelligence assessment concluded in June chemical weapons have been . used in Syria's civil war, but Washington has taken no military action . against Assad's forces. U.S. officials have instead focused on trying to organize a peace conference between the government and opposition. Obama has authorized weapons deliveries to rebel groups, but none are believed to have been sent so far. Calling Assad a 'thug' and a 'murderer,' John Kerry declared, 'History would judge us all extraordinarily harshly if we turned a blind eye to a dictator's use of chemical weapons.' 'Evidence': Secretary of State John Kerry said images like these contributed to the U.S. assessment that chemical weapons were used in Syria . In his first comments on Syria since the alleged chemical attack, Obama said the U.S. was still trying to find out what happened. Hagel said on Friday that a determination on the chemical attack should be made swiftly because 'there may be another attack coming,' although he added that 'we don't know' whether that will happen. After rebels similarly reported chemical attacks in February, U.S. confirmation took more than four months. In this instance, a UN chemical weapons team is already on the ground in Syria. Assad's government, then as now, has rejected the claims as baseless. Obama also cited the need for the U.S. to be part of a coalition in dealing with Syria. America's ability by itself to solve the Arab country's sectarian fighting is 'overstated,' he said.","President Obama said to be weighing military options after warning Assad chemical weapons use would be crossing a 'red line'

"Everton have advised fans to delay making any travel arrangements to next month's Europa League match against Dynamo Kiev. Friday's last-16 draw paired Britain's last representatives in the competition with the Ukrainian team. The Toffees are scheduled to host the Ukrainian outfit in the first leg on March 12 before making the away trip a week later. However, trouble flared at Dynamo's round-of-32 second-leg victory over Guingamp in Kiev on Thursday. The game was suspended for around 10 minutes by referee Martin Strombergsson towards the end. Everton supporters have been urged to wait before booking trips for their Europa League clash in Kiev . The Merseyside club's travelling support will have been keen to book flights before prices inevitably go up . UEFA announced on Friday it was opening disciplinary proceedings, with Dynamo's list of charges including crowd disturbances, field invasion by supporters and the setting off/throwing of fireworks and objects. The disciplinary case is set to be dealt with by UEFA next Wednesday and as a result Everton are urging fans to hold fire making any bookings. A statement from the club read: 'Everton is advising any supporters considering booking travel to Kiev to wait until our official allocation, and the ticketing criteria, have been confirmed. This is likely to be early next week. 'We are also aware of the discussions between Dynamo and UEFA over safety and security matters following the incidents in the stadium during the round-of-32 fixture against Guingamp and will provide any updates on this as soon as possible. 'Details on tickets and official travel packages will appear on evertonfc.com in due course. This is likely to be on Monday March 2.' Dynamo Kiev supporters came to blows during the Europa League game against Guingamp . Dynamo Kiev's fans began fighting among themselves and the referee had no option but to halt the game . Boss Roberto Martinez had earlier said: 'At the moment there is a UEFA investigation going on and we don't know any more details from that point of view. 'We are going to take every step as it comes and wait for instructions. 'At the moment it is just about concentrating on the first leg and seeing how the investigation goes with UEFA.' Martinez - whose side sealed their last-16 place with a 3-1 home victory over Swiss side Young Boys on Thursday, triumphing 7-2 on aggregate - also said he was 'very excited' by the prospect of the Dynamo tie, which he expects to be tough. Players for Dynamo had to intervene and now there could be sanctions from UEFA on the club . Roberto Martinez said that the draw against the Ukrainian league leaders was an exciting one . 'It is a draw that we are very excited about,' the Spaniard said. 'Dynamo Kiev are a top team - they are unbeaten in and top of their domestic league, ahead of teams we know about well in terms of being strong in Europe, like Shakhtar Donetsk and Dnipro. 'They have some well-known players and play in a phenomenal facility. Their ground is special. 'In that respect, it is what we expected - a tough team. 'You always prefer to play at home in the second leg, and unfortunately that is not going to be the case, but there is nothing we can do in that respect.' Everton supporters gather in Wankdorf ahead of their game against Young Boys in the last round . Martinez was speaking at his press conference to preview Sunday's Barclays Premier League clash with Arsenal, and he expects Toffees striker Romelu Lukaku to be fit for the game at the Emirates Stadium. Lukaku came off early in the second half of Thursday's match, but his manager played down suggestions a hamstring problem might keep him out this weekend. Martinez said: 'Rom is fine. Yesterday was just making sure that we didn't accumulate too much work. 'The hamstring is fine, he has trained well this morning and I don't expect it to be a problem for the weekend.' UEFA will deal with Dynamo's disciplinary case on Wednesday, and that will make the situation more clear . Everton fans show a banner supporting their side on their previous European trip to Switzerland last week . Everton have John Stones and Aaron Lennon, suspended and cup-tied respectively on Thursday, available, but remain without Aiden McGeady, Steven Pienaar, Tony Hibbert (all knee), Bryan Oviedo (hamstring) and Christian Atsu (illness). Martinez said: 'Aiden McGeady has been working really well this morning, but just individually, not with the group, and it is exactly the same with Tony Hibbert. He will be a couple of weeks. 'Steven Pienaar is joining the group, but I don't think he's ready to be in the squad. 'Bryan Oviedo has started his recovery, but it could be between three and four weeks before he can join the group. 'Christian has flu symptoms and is going to be out of this squad, but I expect him to be available for the next game (Stoke away next Wednesday).' Romelu Lukaku is available for Everton despite being substituted for Arouna Kone on Thursday night .","Everton have drawn Dynamo Kiev in the last 16 of the Europa League .

"Somalia's al-Shabaab group has banned samosas after ruling the popular snacks are 'offensive' and too Christian. Militant Islamist fighters last week used vehicles mounted with loudspeakers to announce the bizarre ruling across the regions of the war-torn country it controls. The extremist group has offered no official explanation for the ban on the triangular snacks, which are commonly cooked up and served across the Horn of Africa. 'Offensive': The samosa is said upset militant Islamists due to a supposed resemblance to the Christian Holy Trinity . The bizarre ban comes just days after militants linked to Al-Qaida in Somalia refused to let some aid workers into the country as tens of thousands suffered in the nation's massive famine. Aid groups including the UN Food Programme say they were not given permission by militants to provide aid in the country, where it has been warned that 800,000 children could die from starvation. It is now thought islamist militants have taken offence at the three-sided samosa's supposed resemblance to symbol of the Christian Holy Trinity. Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper today reported that residents of the Somali town of Afgoye, 20 miles south of the capital Mogadishu, had confirmed the samosa ban had been imposed. The fried snacks, usually filled with spicy meat or vegetables, have been served for centuries in the East African country. But the newspaper said locals believed al-Shabaab leaders had decided the triangular shape was not compatible with their strict version of Islam. The unexpected move means Somalis could now expect to be punished if caught cooking, buying or eating samosas, known locally as sambusas. The ban is the latest in a string of authoritarian rulings introduced by al-Shabaab, a violent Islamist organisation linked to al-Qaeda and classified by several countries as a terrorist group. The . word 'samosa' derives from the Persian 'sanbosag'. It is referred to as . 'sambusak' or a similar variation in most parts of the Arabic-speaking . world. The snack is thought to have . originated in Central Asia before the 10th century and was introduced to . the Indian subcontinent around 1300 by traders in the region. Records from the 14th century . describe a 'small pie stuffed with minced meat, almonds, pistachio, . walnuts and spices', served before the third course. The snack, popular in South Asia for centuries, then gained popularity when bought to India by Muslim traders and soldiers. The crispy meat-filled samosa made today was then made around campfires and saved by travelers as snacks for long journeys. The extremist army has taken command of several provinces of Somalia and is fighting the country's official government for total control. However it has been widely criticised for its strict enforcement of Shariah law and unmerciful treatment of the population. Resemblance: Islamic militants say samosas look like the Christian Holy Trinity . At the weekend the organisation sparked outrage after saying it would refuse to allow overseas aid agencies into drought-hit parts of Somalia. The UN last week declared a famine in two parts of the country and warned millions face death from starvation. Al-Shabaab had previously suggested it would allow foreign agencies to bring in vital food aid to prevent its people from dying. But on Friday the group denied the . famine even existed and accused Western governments of inventing the . crisis as a propaganda tool. The organisation also warned foreign agencies were still banned in the regions of Somalia it controlled. Experts . have warned the group's refusal to acknowledge the food crisis could . cause millions of unnecessary deaths as people struggle to find food . amid a devastating drought. The . reported ban on samosas is the latest in a string of bizarre rulings . from the organisation, which has been likened to the Afghan Taliban. Earlier this year the group introduced a blanket ban on the playing or watching of football. It . has also previously ordered men to grow beards and warned it will take . action against anyone caught wearing tight-fitting clothes. Not allowed: Samosas have been banned in many small towns near the Somali capital of Mogadishu .",Militants believe triangular snack 'resembles Christian Holy Trinity'
"This is the little boy who could be killed by a nursery rhyme. Tiny Jayson Hart, aged nine months, was born with a rare heart condition that means his heart could stop at any minute if he is shocked or startled. It means his mother Kelley Hart, from Hockley, Essex, cannot read him favourite nursery rhymes, such as Ring a Ring o' Roses, in which there are sudden loud noises. Scroll down for video . The condition means him mother Kelley, 25, cannot read him favourite nursery rhymes in which there are sudden loud noises . Jayson was born in November 2013 with Long QT Syndrome. It is a rare inherited heart condition which increases the risk of . irregular heartbeats, which can lead to fainting and sudden death. Miss Hart, 25, who also has the condition, said: ‘We have to be very careful with Jayson. We can’t sing any loud nursery rhymes to him and we have to be very careful with some of them if there are any sudden loud noises or clapping. 'We have to read things to him very gently and only clap very quietly and slowly. ‘He can’t have any squeaky toys, no loud rattles and we have to keep him away from balloons, so he can’t go to children’s parties where there are balloons. Anything with a loud noise can stop his heart.’ Jayson was diagnosed at birth with the condition. The young boy's condition can be . triggered by a change in temperature meaning he cannot run into the sea or . jump into a cold swimming pool. The family have not got a telephone or a doorbell as even these loud sudden noises could also fatally shock him. He is also unable to go on fairground rides. Jayson Hart was born with Long QT Syndrome, a rare heart condition, which means his heart could stop if he is shocked or startled . Miss Hart, who lives with partner Greg . Allen, 27, a construction worker, was diagnosed with the condition at the age of 10, after she fainted several times. She said: ‘I collapsed the first time . when I was swimming in a local pool. 'I’d . just pushed off from the side of the pool when everything went black. I . came round to find myself lying on the edge of the pool with a foil . blanket wrapped around me. 'I was told that I’d passed out in the water and had sunk to the bottom of the pool before being hauled out. ‘Mum rushed me straight to the doctors . but it took six months of tests to finally found out what was wrong with . me. And I collapsed several further times during those months.’ Miss Hart was diagnosed with Long QT . Syndrome and was fitted with a pacemaker, which will restart her heart should it . stop. Long QT syndrome is a rare and serious heart condition. It occurs in about 1 in 2,000 people. The syndrome can cause fainting as well as episodes of an abnormally rapid heart rhythm, called arrhythmia. The arrhythmia happens because the electrical activity of the heart is disrupted. These episodes may be provoked by any sort of adrenalin rush through the body, often caused by a shock or start. Not everyone with long QT syndrome will experience arrhythmia, but when it does happen it can be fatal. LQTS can be genetically inherited, but it can also be caused by some medications which patients might be taking for other medical conditions. She and Mr Allen were thrilled when she fell pregnant, but were . worried that their baby would inherit the deadly condition. She . said: ‘We were just terrified that the baby would inherit it from me. When Jayson was born by caesarian section we were thrilled, but then . when he was only a day old, tests confirmed that he had the condition . too. 'We were devastated. I was glad that they had discovered it early, . but terrified about what the future meant for him.’ Jayson’s condition is currently being controlled by medication, but he may have to have a pacemaker fitted as he grows older. But the family still have to be careful not to give him a sudden shock. Miss Hart said: ‘My mother was babysitting recently and a glass shattered and the shock of the noise made him turn blue. 'Mum picked him up and the colour came straight back, but we can never be too careful with him.’ Miss Hart added: ‘He can’t do anything that would cause adrenaline to surge around his body, so that also means that he can’t go on an fairground rides. 'When its bonfire night we will have to fit him with special sound proof ear muffs as the loud bang of the fireworks could prove fatal.’ Both his parents have been trained in CPR, although so far they have not needed to resuscitate him. Miss Hart added: ‘Greg and I are always on red alert in case anything happens and we have to save Jayson’s life. 'We have to be so careful and constantly be on the look out for things that could shock him. We try to let him live as normal a life as possible, but it can be difficult.’","Young Jayson Hart inherited Long QT Syndrome from his mother, Kelley .

"Ed Miliband attempted to boost his prime ministerial credentials yesterday when he met Barack Obama at the White House – albeit for just 25 minutes. In the high-stakes meeting, known as a ‘brush-by’, the two men discussed the situations in Ukraine, Gaza, the Scottish referendum and the cost of living crisis, said Labour officials. A chat and all-important photo-opportunity with the U.S. president is seen as electoral gold dust for a British opposition leader. Meeting: Ed Miliband was officially in Washington to meet national security adviser Susan Rice but Barack Obama dropped in for what is known as a 'brush by' Labour officials were reportedly . terrified of a repeat performance of Gordon Brown’s hapless attempts to . get together with Mr Obama in 2009. After five unsuccessful requests, Mr . Brown had to make do with a humiliating five-minute chat in the . kitchens of the United Nations headquarters. Fearing failure again, party officials kept the Miliband visit secret until after he arrived in Washington on Sunday. There . had been worries Mr Miliband would also be shoved off the presidential . agenda by more pressing world events and his rejection of military . intervention in Syria last year. However, the meeting may have been helped by the presence of several ex-Obama aides on the Labour election team. Mr . Miliband missed the chance to respond to an urgent statement in the . House of Commons on action against Russia following the crash of MH17 . for the trip, which was kept secret and only confirmed by his office . after he arrived in the US. He . said in an interview on arrival that he wanted to be prime minister . next year, and felt it was important to discuss ‘the many pressing . issues our country faces’ with the U.S. ‘Whether . you think about trade and jobs or terrorism and climate change, we’ve . got to work with the United States’, he told ITV News. ‘As . somebody who wants to be the prime minister in less than 10 months’ time, it’s important I’m here talking to key figures in the . administration about the many pressing issued that our country faces and . indeed the world faces’. He . denied his scuppering of military strikes on Syria, in a dramatic vote a . year ago, had cooled relations with the U.S., as claimed last week by a . former presidential adviser. As . to whether he had pleaded for a meeting with the president, he said: . ‘No, this is about saying that I’m determined to engage with the United . States at all levels of the administration.’ He . also revealed he had not seen his brother David – who he challenged for . the Labour party leadership –  and now lives in New York who he said . was on holiday with his family ‘some distance’ away. Mr Miliband and President Obama met at Buckingham Palace in May 2011, when he warned Labour can only win the next election if he embraces a more optimistic vision for Britain's future . Damian McBride (left), a former spin doctor to Gordon Brown, insisted the Labour leader was wasting his time . Talks . between an opposition leader and the US President can be a high-stakes . affair which has been described as a ‘job interview for being prime . minister’. Mr Miliband – who . met Barack Obama in London last year –was anxious to avert the disaster . suffered by Gordon Brown in September 2009. The . then prime minister was snubbed five times by Mr Obama when they both . attended a UN summit in New York, and they eventually held a bizarre . meeting in a UN kitchen. Neil . Kinnock’s meeting with Ronald Reagan just before the 1987 election . turned to disaster when the president then went public with deep . concerns about his views on nuclear disarmament. Mr . Miliband also gave a speech to the Center for American Progress think . tank in Washington, calling for sanctions against Russia to be . tightened. Several former . Labour insiders said he had ‘wasted time’ trying to win cheap political . kudos. Former Labour spin doctor Damian McBride warned that the . ‘charade’ served nobody’s purposes and Mr Miliband later told ITV that . he had not ‘pleaded’ for a meeting with Mr Obama. And . with poor timing for Mr Miliband, Tony Blair yesterday blasted the . Labour leader’s anti-business agenda – and warned his enthusiasm for . state control was at odds with public opinion. Gordon Brown was snubbed by President Obama five times in 2009 before being granted a chat while walking through a kitchen at the United Nations . The . former Prime Minister suggested Mr Miliband had learned the wrong . lessons from the financial crash and suggested he should tone down his . anti-bank rhetoric. In a . warning to Mr Miliband, who has embraced some Old Labour principles such . as price controls and nationalisation, he said: ‘Old ideas in new . clothing are still old ideas – and are visibly so when undressed by . reality.’ He told the . Blairite group Progress that the Labour leadership was wrong to think . the public has ‘fallen back in love with the state’.","Labour leader travelled to Washington for talks with the President .

To be fair the players didn't make the game easy for the match officials by pressurising them to caution and dismiss fellow professionals.

"Disturbing: Maddy Jackson, 4, sporting the new must-have accessory - removable breasts for toddlers . Barely out of nappies, four-year-old Maddy Jackson is already on the road to womanhood. Sporting fake C cup breasts and padding on her bottom, she is the latest shock contestant on Toddlers and Tiaras, the U.S. reality show revealing the surreal world of beauty pageants. In an attempt to mimic her curvaceous icon, country singer Dolly Parton - who is known for her ample cleavage - the toddler is shown sporting detachable bust and butt enhancements, before performing live on stage. With the extra padding concealed under her Barbie pink Lycra catsuit, Maddy's tiny frame is transformed into an hourglass silhouette. Barely able to string a sentence together, many will be shocked by the images of the peroxide blonde trying to emulate the appearance of a woman in her late 20s. When questioned on NBC's Today show, her mother Lindsay, who entered her first pageant contest when she was nine months old, defends the enhancements used by her daughter. She tells presenter Savannah . Guthrie: 'To some people, it's over the top, to us it's just what happens... It's just normal. When she wears the fake boobs and the fake butt, it's just like extra bonus.' But others seems less convinced and Maddy's stylist Michael Booth believes the attire is a step to far. Interviewed backstage at the competition, where hundreds of young hopefuls battle it out to be crowned beauty queen, Michael said: 'I wasn’t a big fan of the outfit with the boobs in it. She’s very young, but hopefully the judges will perceive it in good taste.' Other young contestants also seem perturbed by her appearance, as they watch Lindsay rearrange her daughter's fake breasts and one even probes the chicken fillets before Maddy crosses her arms defensively.

Maddy's grandma, Barbara also defends the beauty pageant world, which is primarily concerned with contestant's external appearance, explaining that the cash prizes can be put towards expensive schooling fees and dozens of toys for the children. The show has caused outcry with many who believe that it could influence youngsters to adopt similar behaviour and campaigners have even set up a Facebook group, 'Take ""Toddlers And Tiaras"" off the Air!' in a bid to have the plug pulled on the show.

Despite criticism Lindsay is happy for her child to be glamourised and states that her daughter thoroughly enjoys it as a hobby and can stop competing at any time.

"Harry Redknapp will be reunited with Jermain Defoe in January with the striker set to make a permanent switch from FC Toronto. Defoe, who has scored 19 times for England in 55 appearances, came close to joining Rangers in the summer as his MLS switch went sour. The 32-year-old was persuaded to move to Canada from Tottenham in January by Toronto's then-manager Ryan Nelsen, a former team-mate of Defoe's at Spurs.

Defoe and now-QPR manager Harry Redknapp collect Barclays Premier League player and manager of the month awards while the pair were together at Tottenham back in August 2009 . But Defoe has been unsettled at the club since Nelsen was sacked in August and Sportsmail understands he will make the move back to England in January. The London Evening Standard report that Defoe will sign a three-year contract at Loftus Road worth around £90,000-a-week. Redknapp gave Defoe his West Ham debut in 1999, signed him for Portsmouth in 2008, and again for Spurs a year later.

"This is the amazing moment where a baby bear runs from the woods onto the green of a golf course and begins performing circus tricks. Two other baby bears remain on the edge of the green as their more adventurous sibling makes his way to the flag. The bear quickly reaches out to the flag and rears up onto his hind legs. The adventurous baby bear approaches the flag marking the pin with a certain degree of trepidation . The bear grasps the pole with his paw as two of his more nervous siblings watch from the edge of the green . After about one minute, he starts pulling down the flag and begins dancing around in a circle. Then he changes to a forward and back motion. The bear was spotted by Andi Dzilums as he played with friends at the Fairmont Hot Springs' golf course in British Columbia, Canada. Mr Dzilums said: 'It was a once-in-a-lifetime thing to see this amazing baby bear playing like all kids do!' At one stage the bear pulls the pole down towards the ground and attempts to chew on the red flag. He then releases the flag which springs up at some considerable speed. Soon the bear starts climbing on the pole before beginning his unusual dance routine and swinging around . The bear then decides it wants to play with the flag and pulls down on the flag bending it over . Standing on his hind legs, the bear begins to swing around on the pole before trying to bite the red flag . Having lost interest in the flag, the bear then spots one of the player's golf balls which was lying a tricky 12-foot putt from the hole. The bear bounds over to the bright yellow ball and takes it into its mouth before retreating to the edge of the green. The video, which was posted on YouTube, has been viewed almost 625,000 times. Eventually the bear gets bored playing with the pole and instead decides to investigate the yellow golf ball . Unfortunately for the golfers, the bear picks up the ball and trudges over to the edge of the green .","Andi Dzilums was playing a round of golf with friends when he saw the bear .

"Rest in peace: Diane Disney Miller, 79, daughter of Walt Disney, the only biological child of Walt Disney, died November 19, 2013 in Napa, California from injuries sustained in a fall . Diane Disney Miller, the well-respected philanthropist and daughter of Walt Disney, has died at her home in Napa, California. She was 79 years old. Her death Tuesday was confirmed by The Walt Disney Co. The cause was complications from a fall in September, according to the Los Angeles Times. ‘As the beloved daughter of Walt Disney and one of his inspirations for creating Disneyland, she holds a special place in the history of The Walt Disney Co. and in the hearts of fans everywhere,’ Robert A. Iger, the company's president and CEO, said in a statement. ‘She will be remembered for her grace and generosity and tireless work to preserve her father's legacy.’ Miss Miller, the eldest and only biological daughter of Walt and Lillian Disney, was born December 18, 1933. In later life, she remembered her father as a man who was caring and patient with his children. ‘He'd take me and my sister Sharon to the merry-go-round at Griffith Park and stand there all day waiting until we were ready to go,’ Miller told the San Francisco Chronicle in 1998. ‘As he stood there, he kept thinking there should be more for parents and children to do together, and the idea for Disneyland was born.’ Mickey Mouse's girls: Walt Disney (center) with adopted daughter Sharon Disney (left) and Diane (right), who was born in 1933 .

Happy memories: Diane Disney Miller, seen as a young girl riding in a teacup with her parents in 1955, described her father as a man who was caring and patient with his children . Disney Miller married professional football player Ron Miller in 1954. He went on to serve as the company's president in 1978 and chief executive a few years later. Ron Miller was ousted from the company in 1984, paving the way for the new executive team of Michael Eisner, Jeffrey Katzenberg and Frank Wells, who helped transform a sleepy theme park and animation company into an entertainment giant with hit movies, TV shows and new theme park attractions in Orlando, Florida, and Paris. Miss Miller, a respected philanthropist, also played a key role in the completion of the Frank Gehry-designed Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, a project started with a $50million gift from her mother. In 1997, she bucked project leaders like Richard Riordan, the mayor at the time, and the billionaire Eli Broad, who said Gehry's firm lacked the experience to execute the plans for the building's unusual curved polished steel design.

At a crucial point, Miller threatened to withhold the roughly $20million remaining of her mother's gift if Gehry was not kept on. ‘She was the turning point,’ Gehry told the Los Angeles Times in September. 'I wanted something that would bear my father’s name, that would come from his wealth but not be commercial,' she told the Times in September during a gala celebrating the 10th anniversary of the concert hall. Miss Miller also founded the Walt Disney Family Museum, which opened in 2009 in San Francisco's Presidio, as a tribute to her family's legacy. Grand tribute: Miss Miller (left) also founded the Walt Disney Family Museum, which opened in 2009 in San Francisco's Presidio .

She is survived by her husband, Ronald, who owns the Silverado Vineyards Winery in Napa Valley, as well as seven children and 13 grandchildren.","Miss Disney Miller, Walt Disney's sole biological daughter, has died from complications after a fall in September .

"Google has created an 'artificial brain' from 16,000 computer processors, and sat it down with an internet connection. But, there's a certain grim inevitability to the fact that the YouTube company's creation began watching stills from cat videos. The team, led by Google's Dr Jeff Dean, used the 16,000 processor array to create a brain-style 'neural network' with more than a billion connections. There's a certain grim inevitability to the fact that the YouTube company's creation began watching stills from cat videos . Recognising faces: Google was able to pick out the characteristics of face and label images correctly . The team then fed it random images culled from 10 million YouTube videos - and let it 'learn' by itself. Unsurprisingly, the machine focused in on cats. 'We never told it during the training, . ‘This is a cat,'' said Dr. Dean. 'It basically invented the concept of a . cat.' 'Contrary . to what appears to be a widely-held intuition, our experimental results . reveal that it is possible to train a face detector without having to label . images as containing a face or not,' says the team in a paper published this week. 'We also find that the same network is sensitive to other high-level . concepts such as cat faces and human bodies.

"Pope Francis today lay prostrate in the centre of St Peter's Basilica in the Vatican to commemorate Jesus' death by crucifixion. During the 'Passion of the Lord' service in the Vatican, Pope Francis heard from the Vatican's official preacher who condemned huge salaries claiming people were cursed by the 'hunger for gold. Fr Raniero Cantalamessa, who is the 'preacher of the pontifical household' used the story of Judas and the 30 pieces of silver to criticise modern society's obsession with status. Pope Francis lies before the altar in St Peter's Basillica at the Vatican during the Celebration of the Lord's Passion on Good Friday . Good Friday is the only day in the Roman Catholic calendar where no mass is said, instead the Passion of the Christ is celebrated . The congregation attending the Celebration of the Lord's Passion on Good Friday heard that large executive salaries were similar to Judas accepting the 30 pieces of silver to betray Jesus . The marathon service which tells the story of Jesus' crucifixion and death is one of the only times in the year when the Pope listens while another cleric preaches. According to Reuters, Fr Catalamessa told worshipers: 'Behind every evil in our society is money, or at least in part. 'The financial crisis that the world has gone through and that this country (Italy) is still going through - is it not in large part due to the cursed hunger for gold?' he said. He added: 'Is it not also a scandal that some people earn salaries and collect pensions that are sometimes 100 times higher than those of the people who work for them and that they raise their voices to object when a proposal is put forward to reduce their salary for the sake of greater social justice?' Since his election, Pope Francis has returned to inequity in society and the system of huge financial bonuses for senior executives. Pope Francis will later lead a candlelight 'Way of the Cross' procession around the colosseum in Rome. Tomorrow, he will say mass in St Peter's Basilica before delivering his 'Urbi et Orbi' (to the city and the world) message to the world's 1.2 billion Roman Catholics. Later this month, Pope Francis will canonise Pope John Paul II and Pope John XXIII. It is the first time that two former popes will be made saints on the same day.

"Top military officials have been warned not to have sex with attractive women in Russia or China in case they are spies, it has been reported. A leaked document says agents of the FSB, Russia's intelligence service and successor to the Soviet-era KGB, could attempt to lure British officials into bed and then blackmail them. The document, the Ministry of Defence Manual of Security, warns senior officers that the FSB, could gain valuable intelligence by exploiting 'knowledge of marital infidelity or sexual activity the target may wish to hide'. Scroll down for video . Not who she seems? Top military officials have been warned not to have sex with attractive women in Russia or China in case they are spies, it has been reported. Picture posed by model . The KGB used 'honey traps' like this extensively during the Cold War, using both men and women to target those they believed to have valuable information. The Communist East German security services targeted young men to seduce middle-aged West German secretaries working for senior officials. So convincing were these young men that one woman who was told her lover had been a spy that she refused to believe it, stating: 'He did really love me.' One senior military official told the Sunday Times how a very attractive blonde woman in her early 30s approached him in a St Petersburg hotel and began chatting about how she loved vintage British sports cars - the man's hobby. She flirted with him and he suddenly became suspicious and left suddenly. He said: 'I think i said something very awkward like ""sorry, it's my bedtime"" and scarpered. I put it down as a close shave.' A Ministry of Defence spokesperson refused to comment on the report. Russian spy Anna Chapman (left) was deported from the US in 2010 while Katia Zatuliveter was accused of being a Kremlin agent who had an affair with Liberal Democrat MP Mike Hancock while working for him in Parliament . In 2010 Russian Katia Zatuliveter was accused of being a Kremlin spy after it emerged she had had an affair with Commons Defence Committee MP Mike Hancock. She denied the claim and later won an appeal against deportation from the UK. The scandal came after a ring of 10 Russian spies were rounded up and deported from the US. One of the spies, Anna Chapman, had lived and worked in London before marrying and gaining a British passport. In 2009 an American diplomat in Moscow was embroiled in a sex scandal after footage apparently showing him with a prostitute was released on the internet. The married envoy, a second secretary, was named as Kyle Hatcher by two Russian newspapers which reported unconfirmed claims that he was a CIA undercover agent. Russian newspapers were apparently tipped off about the footage, suggesting that the FSB was behind it. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow complained to the Russian Foreign Ministry about the tape and the State Department said the video was a fabricated montage that includes some real footage of Mr Hatcher, a married diplomatic liaison to Russian religious and human rights groups. Meanwhile, Britain’s spy chiefs have launched a recruitment drive for Russian-speaking agents amid mounting tensions with the Kremlin. MI5, responsible for protecting the UK against terror attacks and other security threats, has placed an advert on its website calling for Russian language specialists to apply. The drive comes amid warnings of a new Cold War between Russia and the West as tensions continue to rise over the military stand-off in Ukraine. Up to 50 Russian spies are said to be operating in Britain, with ex-MI5 boss Jonathan Evans claiming there has been ‘no decrease in the number of undeclared Russian intelligence officers in the UK’ since the end of the Cold War. The new recruitment campaign is being run jointly with Government’s eavesdropping centre GCHQ, which gathers intelligence for the Government and Armed Forces by tapping phones and monitoring the internet.","Russian security services 'may use honey traps to blackmail personnel'

"Armed police arrested a man suspected of giving a machine gun to children after this shocking image was taken at a school playground. 'Ashamed' parents ignored youngsters' revelations that a man with a gun had been in the Morton playground, Leics, and dismissed their children's stories. The next morning a mum-of-three was sent this harrowing picture - apparently taken at the park at about 6pm the previous day - showing a man brandishing an automatic gun. Horror: Armed police arrested a man suspected of giving a machine gun to children after this shocking image was taken at a school playground in Leicester . Children ran home to tell their parents about the man - who had even given the weapon to an eight-year-old boy to hold. Armed officers surrounded the play area and eventually arrested a 57-year-old man in Brighton Road, Northfields, in connection with the incident after 'imitation' firearms were recovered. The 26-year-old mum, who did not want to be named, said: 'When the picture was sent to me on Tuesday morning I just could not believe my eyes. 'I felt so shocked and worried but also guilty because my eight-year-old daughter had been at the playground when it happened and told me there had been a man with a gun. 'She said he had even given it to a boy to hold. I am ashamed to say I didn't really pay any attention to her, but after I saw the photo I called the police. 'They came round and I showed them the photograph.' The mum said that later that day she saw armed officers descend on the area. The terrifying incident happened at Merrydale Infants School in the Northfields area of Leicester . She said: 'It was about 5pm and I looked over to see armed police everywhere. There were cars and vans and lots of officers with guns. 'They arrested a man on a street not far from the playground. They also searched his house.' The mum said police took a statement from her and chatted to her daughter. She said: 'They asked her to draw the gun but she couldn't. She did draw the big shiny gold bullets in a magazine, though. 'When I saw her drawing I was shocked. No eight-year-old girl should be exposed to this. It's awful.' Another parent, who lives opposite the playground, said: 'My son told me he had seen a man with a big gun with bullets in, but I thought he was making it up. Then I saw the photograph. 'All the parents around here are scared. None of us want to let our children out. 'The police arrested a man but then let him out. We don't really know what is going on.' Merrydale Infants School, in Claydon Road, Northfields, sent a letter to parents on Wednesday telling them about what had happened. A Leicestershire Police spokeswoman said: 'Police received a call at 9.10am on Tuesday from a member of the public who reported that a man had been seen in the area of Longleat Close in Leicester the previous day carrying what was believed to be a firearm. 'Following police inquiries, armed response officers stopped a man in the area of Brighton Road, who was arrested in connection with the incident.

"Manchester United winger Wilfried Zaha will head back to the club for pre-season determined to break into the first-team fold as the Louis van Gaal era dawns at Old Trafford. Zaha is yet to be informed whether he will be a part of Manchester United’s pre-season tour of the USA but he is hopeful that he will be included in the group as the club head across the Atlantic to warm up for the new season with matches against LA Galaxy, Roma, Inter Milan and Real Madrid. He is expected to learn his fate in the coming weeks once Van Gaal touches down in Manchester after Holland’s involvement at the World Cup, but Sportsmail understands that Zaha’s preference would be to remain with United next season. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Goal-fest from Ravel, Zaha and Sterling during England U21s training . Praying: Zaha wants another chance at United despite a disappointing start to his career at the club . Subbed: Zaha makes way for Wayne Rooney during a poor display in the Capital One Cup against Norwich . The former Crystal Palace wide-man endured an immensely disappointing first season at Old Trafford under David Moyes, where the England under-21 international failed to start a single match in the Barclays Premier League before being loaned out to Cardiff City in January. Zaha was Sir Alex Ferguson’s final signing as Manchester United manager, joining the club in a £15million deal and on a five-and-a-half year contract. United will not be keen to give up on such a significant investment so early in his spell at the club. However, there is also a recognition that work will need to be done to resuscitate the winger’s Manchester United career after a debut campaign fraught with tension. Challenge: Zaha has struggled to make the step up at United since joining from Crystal Palace . Despite impressing on the club’s pre-season tour, relations between Zaha and United became increasingly strained last season, with former manager Moyes showing little faith at all in the 21-year-old. Although the player felt that he was not being given a fair chance by Moyes, the consensus from United insiders was that Zaha had failed to adapt to the very highest standards expected by the club. Moyes felt that his contribution on the training ground was below the level that he demanded and senior figures became concerned around December that there was little sign of improvement. Experience: The attacker was shipped out on loan to Cardiff but could not save them from the drop . For all the defects in Zaha’s game, however, supporters and certain coaches began to question why Zaha was not handed an opportunity in the first-team when established regulars such as Antonio Valencia, Ashley Young, Nani and Shinji Kagawa so often produced below-par performances, as United slumped to 7th place in the Barclays Premier League and crashed out of both the Capital One Cup and FA Cup in January. Van Gaal is expected to take guidance from assistant manager Ryan Giggs over his young players but Zaha’s raw pace and ability to take players on may appeal to a manager whose teams are known for attacking with speed and on the counter-attack. However, after also struggling for form under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at Cardiff, Zaha has work to do to convince the United hierarchy that he can make a positive contribution at Old Trafford. Waiting game: Zaha is eager to impress Louis van Gaal ahead of United's pre-season tour of the US .

"A new roller coaster promises to terrorise thrill-seekers in a whole new way after it was designed with the help of psychology experts and scientific researchers. Alton Towers' Smiler opens in May, with plunging drops of up to 98ft and maximum speeds of 53mph. But it is the roller coaster's psychological effects that are set to push thrill-seekers to their limits, and the designers promise to 'blur the line between illusion and reality'. Scream if you want to go faster: The Smiler will feature five 'tricks' that it plays on the mind . Fear injection: Huge needles and hypnotic swirls all combine to distract and disorientate . Are you ticklish? The 'Tickler' looks more like a car wash than a tickling stick . Katherine Duckworth, one of the team who came up with the concept for the ride, explained: 'This ride will put not just your body but also your mind through its paces. 'We want people to get off the ride and not know what is real. 'There are five different mind effects, which are all designed to mess with your head. You shoot towards giant syringes, spinning hypnotic wheels, and flashing lights, among other things.' These props are more than just background scenery. Each is a psychological trigger, set to keep the passengers on edge by disorientating and misleading them. The ride blasts towards huge needles and what looks like a drive-through car wash but, of course, the threat they present is only in the mind. But while worrying about whether you are about to be impaled on a giant spike, your brain isn't preparing you for the huge drop just around the corner... Blinding: Strobe lights will dazzle you... alongside other secrets that are set to catch out passengers . 'There is more track per square metre than any other ride in the world,' adds Katherine. 'It is twice the size of Nemesis and each ride lasts two minutes and 45 seconds. This is a very big roller coaster ride. When you get off, you wont know what is real.' Researchers from New Scientist magazine were involved in Smiler's design. They found anticipation is a key factor in ensuring a thrill and that they worked best when presented as stories or narratives. As such, Smiler even comes with its own back-story - that it was created by the Ministry Of Joy, a secretive organisation that has been conducting top secret experiments on mankind for years. New Scientist editor Jeremy Webb said: 'All the experiences we use to generate thrill involve an element of fear. 'The emotion is triggered by either something physical, such as pain, or a mental one - most commonly the anticipation of danger. 'Thrill is a combination of fear and the euphoria we experience after everything has ended. Under construction: The Smiler roller coaster at Alton Towers opens in May . Set to put a smile on your face: The £18million ride vows to be unlike other roller coasters due to its psychological trickery . Researchers from New Scientist magazine helped provide psychological insights which inspired the design . 'It is like a good play or horror movie when the excitement builds and your heart starts pumping and then everything is OK at the end. 'Rollercoaster designers believe the best possible thrill is created by testing people both mentally and physically. 'Physically, The Smiler will be a better ride than ever but there are going to be those added mental components too. 'Once the 'coaster is opened, Alton Towers will certainly want to be able to say it's the most thrilling ride in the world.' John Wardley, a ride consultant at Alton Towers, said: 'The Smiler is set to be one of the most thrilling rides in the world. 'To heighten the feeling of excitement we needed a ride with a variety of mental cues. 'The Smiler will be different from other traditional rollercoasters in that it will combine intense physical effects along with unique mental elements.'

'We have decided not to speak of the transfer market with regards to Paul until after the World Cup,' Pogba's agent Mino Raiola said to Italian TV station Rai Sport. 'But I can calmly say that his future will still be at Juventus, where he feels very happy.' Pogba currently has two years left on his contract at Juve, who want to extend that. The Golden Ball winner at the 2013 Under-20 World Cup was a regular feature in Antonio Conte's side as they successfully defended their Serie A title last season. Fantasy: Pogba signed himself for Chelsea on Football Manager, but his agent says he will be staying at Juve . Eyes on the prize: For the time being Pogba is focussed on France's World Cup campaign in Brazil . He made 36 appearances in the league, scoring seven goals and setting up another seven in the 2013-14 campaign. The 21-year-old is currently on international duty with France, where he started in two of his team's three group games at the World Cup in Brazil.","The midfielder has been linked with some of Europe's top clubs .

"The boxing legend Muhammad Ali is so ill from Parkinson’s that he can barely speak, his brother has said. The three-time world heavyweight champion was diagnosed with the disease in 1984 but his condition has gradually deteriorated and he is now mostly housebound. He was too ill to attend a premiere of a film about his life last week and his condition meant he could not take part in the production of the movie either. Scroll down for video . Muhammad Ali is said to be so ill from Parkinson's that he can barely talk, according to his brother Rahman Ali . His brother Rahman, 71, attended the screening of I Am Ali in Hollywood, and told The Sunday People: ‘I have not been able to talk to my brother about this because he is sick. ‘He doesn’t speak too well. But he is proud that we are here for him. He has given this film his blessing.’ While his daughter Maryum, 46, who was also at the premiere, said her father would love the film and it will make him laugh and cry. Her sister Hana, 38, is planning to show the legendary boxer the new movie at his Arizona home later this month. Rahman Ali (third right) with brother Muhammad's daughters at the I Am Ali premiere on Wednesday . Directed by Clare Lewins, the documentary movie gives unprecedented access to Ali’s personal archive of ‘audio journals’ as well as interviews with his family and boxers Mike Tyson and George Foreman, and put together to tell his life story. Nicknamed the Louisville Lip for his infamous wit, Ali remained active for several years after his diagnosis and made a moving appearance at the Atlanta 1996 Olympic Games where he lit the flame. However, the sporting icon, who retired from boxing after suffering several strokes, was seen looking particularly thin and frail at the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony where he was helped across the stage by wife Lonnie. Ali looks on as referee Zack Clayton counts out George Foreman in their title bout in Zaire in Octobe 1974 . Ali pictured at the Sports For Peace Fundraising Ball in London in 2012 (left) and in his heyday in 1974 (right) In February 2013 his brother Rahman said Ali was so crippled by the degenerative brain condition that has afflicted many ex-boxers, he might not survive until the summer. He also made claims that the family had been barred from seeing Ali, who is estimated to be worth more than £50million, and could only speak to him on the phone. Rahman said his brother was ‘a prisoner in his own home’ and he is being gravely mistreated by his wife because ‘she is more interested in Ali's money than his well-being’.

"Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia believes American society is eroding in party because women are using the 'F-word' and also thinks social media is 'strange.' The court's longest-serving justice - appointed in 1986 - has opened a window into the man behind the robes - a conservative icon who has helped push the ideas of orginalism and textualism into the legal and political mainstream. In a recent wide-ranging interview with New York magazine, he offered several insights into his personality - along with a few unorthodox opinions. Conservative: Antonin Scalia, 77, has become an icon for conservatives since his appointment in 1986 . Among his more fascinating comments are: a law using flogging as a criminal punishment would be constitutional, that there is a reasonable legal basis for some discrimination against women - like in combat - and that the Devil is still very much at work in the modern world. The 77-year-old Scalia, raised in Queens, New York, by an Italian-American mother and a Sicilian immigrant father, said that he believes American society is sliding downhill. He is perhaps most concerned about the 'coarseness' that culture has taken on. 'You can’t go to a movie - or watch a television show for that matter - without hearing the constant use of the ""F-word"" - including, you know, ladies using it... If you portray it a lot, the society’s going to become that way. It’s very sad,' he lamented. He also said that while there is no legally-acceptable reason to discriminate against someone on the basis of their race, there can be legal justification to discriminate against someone on account of their sex. 'If there’s a reasonable basis for not ­letting women do something - like going into combat or whatnot...' he thinks it could be Constitutionally acceptable. Outspoken: Scalia offered several opinions during a recent interview, including his belief that there are 'intelligent reasons' to discriminate against women . The newest session of the U.S. Supreme Court opened today with a docket that includes numerous cases that are likely to prove contentious and controversial yet again. Among the cases selected to be heard this session are: . The court has not yet been affected by the government shutdown, though Chief Justice John Roberts said the justices might be forced to pause their work after October 11. '...there are some intelligent reasons to treat women differently. I don’t think anybody would deny that.' He added: 'And there really is no, virtually no, intelligent reason to treat people differently on the basis of their skin.' Scalia was appointed by President Ronald Reagan and joined the bench in 1986 - five years before the first web page was published on the Internet. That revelation might help explain his opinions on social networking. 'I don’t know why anyone would like to be 'friended' on the network. I mean, what kind of a narcissistic society is it that ­people want to put out there? ""This is my life, and this is what I did yesterday?"" I mean … good grief. Doesn’t that strike you as strange? I think it’s strange,' he said. Scalia also added 'suspects' that he has gay friends - though he insists he doesn't 'hate' gays. He said he realizes he could end up on the wrong side of history on the gay rights issue, but he doesn't mind - or on other conservative issues he champions. 'You know, for all I know, 50 years from now I may be the Justice Sutherland of the late-twentieth and early-21st century, who’s regarded as: “He was on the losing side of everything, an old fogey, the old view.” And I don’t care,' he said. Scalia also volunteered that, as a devout Catholic, he believes in the Devil at that the Devil is still at work in the world. He said the Devil doesn't possess people like he is depicted as doing in the Gospels - he's 'smarter' now. 'What he’s doing now is getting people not to believe in him or in God. He’s much more successful that way,' he said. When the New York magazine interview expressed surprise at him talking about the Devil, Scalia said he was offended. 'You travel in circles that are so, so removed from mainstream America that you are appalled that anybody would believe in the Devil! Most of mankind has believed in the Devil, for all of history,' he told New York magazine writer Jennifer Senior.","Scalia, 77, is a conservative icon on the court and the longest-serving justice - appointed in 1986 .

"At White Hart Lane on Sunday, Mauricio Pochettino has to make the biggest decision of his short career as head coach of Tottenham: Emmanuel Adebayor cannot play. The striker's lack of commitment at Villa Park last Sunday, when he was dragged off after 58 minutes, was not just an affront to his team-mates, it was an insult to the sport itself. For Pochettino to make his mark at Spurs, to show the players that he really is the boss, Adebayor cannot be in that team to face Stoke City. Emmanuel Adebayor sits on the ground after failing to score against Aston Villa on Sunday . Adebayor was awful at Villa Park on Sunday and his place in the Tottenham team must now be in doubt . The Tottenham striker (centre) sees a chance saved by Villa keeper Brad Guzan when clean through . Time on pitch: 58 minutes . Goals: 0 Shots: 2 On target: 2 . Touches: 32 (see touch map below) Passes: 25 Completed: 20 (80 per cent) Challenges: 5 Challenges won: 1 . Lost Ball: 8 times Recoveries: 0 . Fouls: 1 Offsides: 1 . To make a decision as big as this, to tell a 30-year-old forward who has played for Monaco, Arsenal, Manchester City and Real Madrid, that he no longer justifies his selection will not be easy. Sure, he could play against Stoke at the weekend, he could add to his tally of two goals for Spurs this season and everyone can pretend all is well with the world again. It wouldn’t last. Adebayor’s dwindling number of supporters will often stand up for him and tell you ‘he is unplayable on his day’. It has been an awful long time since anyone has been able to say that about the Togolese striker. A couple of years, or more, perhaps. Adebayor's heat map against Aston Villa - he was a peripheral figure in that match . Adebayor was replaced by Harry Kane after 58 minutes at Villa Park and the change galvanised Tottenham . Tottenham fans' favourite Kane (right) hares off after scoring the winner against Villa in added time . In 2009, when he was still at Arsenal, he scored the best goal of his career inside El Madrigal during a Champions League clash with Villarreal. Adebayor's touch map against Villa - he touched the ball just 32 times . Adebayor, then one of the most feared and accomplished strikers in Europe, still regards that overhead kick as one of his personal favourites. It has not always gone so well. In the past three seasons, since his permanent move to London from Manchester City after a spell on loan at White Hart Lane and time at Real Madrid, he has scored 24 goals. Not good enough. His two this season were one in the 4-0 rout of QPR at White Hart Lane and a header in the 2-1 home defeat against Newcastle. For the long-term health and benefit of this Tottenham team, Pochettino has to stand up to a senior player and show that he is prepared to take the big decisions. Adebayor went through the motions last Sunday, plodding around the pitch until the Spurs fans singing ‘Harry Kane, he is one of us’ finally got their way. By that stage Adebayor had touched the ball just 32 times and failed to round Brad Guzan when he was put through one-on-one with the Villa keeper. Adebayor’s heart just doesn't seem to be in it anymore and that attitude is transmitting itself to the rest of the team. Roberto Soldado, who scored a beauty at Villa Park in their win there the previous season under Andre Villas-Boas, looks shot to bits alongside him. Christian Eriksen, shunted out to the right at Villa when he should be playing in a central role, is a far better player than his form suggests. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino (right) must now drop Adebayor for the weekend's clash with Stoke . Since he moved permanently to Tottenham, Emmanuel Adebayor has not impressed... Adebayor on loan (2011-12) Matches 37 Goals 18 . Adebayor permanently (August 2012-present) Matches 70 Goals 24 . Younes Kaboul, the captain, Etienne Capoue, Danny Rose and Kyle Naughton are among those suffering in this Spurs team when they play in the Premier League. The momentum is with the youngster Kane, a striker with the fraction of Adebayor’s ability. He has the heart of a lion, though. When he replaced Adebayor, his striking work-rate galvanised this Tottenham team. It would be a brave man to argue that it was anything other than the presence of Kane, sprinting everywhere and hustling Villa defenders, that brought Spurs back into this game. In the final minute he showed some admirable qualities when he told Erik Lamela, another substitute, that he would be taking the free-kick that led to Tottenham’s winner. Adebayor (second left) heads in one of his two goals this season, in the 2-1 defeat by Newcastle . Adebayor scoring one of the finest goals of his career, for Arsenal against Villarreal in 2009 . Kane knows he is on to a good thing and his endearing celebration in front of the Spurs fans in the Doug Ellis Stand only adds to his allure. He is a talismanic figure. There is an enthusiasm about his game, a first class attitude and a desire to play, whatever the circumstances or the adversity. Sadly those days are over for Adebayor. Last season, after being isolated by Villas-Boas, the re-integration process began under Tim Sherwood. He responded with a few goals, scoring 14 by the time Sherwood was sacked by Spurs chairman Daniel Levy at the end of the season. Getting a full 90 minutes out of him these days is not easy and Pochettino has to address this growing problem. The fall-out, of course, could run into days, if not weeks, if Adebayor reacts badly. We have been here before with him. Sherwood spoke of ‘managing men’ when he replaced Villas-Boas, but the Spurs forward should be able to manage himself after the clubs he has played for. In January, it is time for Pochettino to tell him to find another.","Mauricio Pochettino must jettison Emmanuel Adebayor against Stoke .

"If you've had enough of drinking substandard instant coffee but don't have the time to rustle up a cappuccino at home, the world's smallest coffee maker could be just what you're looking for. The tiny gadget can deliver a perfect shot of espresso in just 30 seconds and all you need to make it work is a microwave. The Piamo is made from food-safe plastic and includes three parts - a cup, a coffee chamber and a water holder. Microwave ready: The tiny Piamo makes the perfect shot of espresso in just 30 seconds . The cup forms the base of the gadget and the other parts stack on top. When heated in a microwave, the water becomes steam which is then forced through the coffee. After 30 seconds, espresso drips into the cup and once drunk, everything can be put straight into the dishwasher. The Piamo is the brainchild of coffee connoisseur Christoph Meyl, from Munich in Germany, who came up with the ingenious invention in frustration at the lack of coffee-making facilities at his office. With his nearest coffee shop too far away and with just a microwave available at work, desperate Christoph conjured up a solution of his own - fittingly, over a cup of coffee. Christoph is hoping it could spell an end to the ancient hot drinks machines and cheap instant coffee abundant in offices around the world. Piamo is being financed by German crowdfunding website StartNext and if successful will be sold for £60. Handy: Inventor Christoph Meyr hopes to put an end to instant coffee and ageing machines in the office . Clever: The gizmo includes a cup, coffee chamber and water holder and can be put to work with a microwave . Inventor: German office worker Christoph Meyl has had enough of drinking instant coffee at work . 'The idea stems from my love of espresso,' explains Christoph. 'I work in a large building with more than 600 people and on my floor there is a small kitchen but it only has a microwave in it, and the nearest coffee shop is too far away. 'One evening during a coffee with my brother Hendrik, I [moaned] about my situation at work. 'He suggested I take an espresso pot to work, but there is no stove at work to heat it on. 'We were talking about the fact there is only a microwave and an idea was born - an espresso maker for the microwave. He continued: 'We started our adventure and the journey began. 'We came up with several prototypes and tested them over thousands of espressos until we came up with the finished product. 'Our goal is to provide coffee lovers with an espresso maker you can use anywhere that has a microwave. 'Piamo creates a fresh cup of delicious espresso within 30 seconds. It is a great alternative for the office, at home or for travelling.'","The Piamo is the brainchild of German inventor Christoph Meyr .

"A third of honeybee colonies did not survive the winter following last year’s wash-out summer, a survey of beekeepers has revealed. The level of colony losses across England is more than double what it was last year, up to 34% from 16% in 2012, the British Beekeepers Association (BBKA) said. The results reflect poor weather last summer, which frequently prevented honeybees from foraging and gathering pollen, and reduced the amount of food available from flowering plants, as nectar production is temperature dependent. A third of honeybee colonies did not survive the winter following last year¿s wash-out summer . As a result there was inadequate nutrition for bees, especially during late summer when the specialised bees which take the colony through winter are born. The poor weather also hit mating for new virgin queens, causing their colonies to die out. It is the worst set of results since the BBKA started its annual survey of members to see how honeybee colonies were faring over winter six years ago. The poor weather also hit mating for new virgin queens, causing their colonies to die out . Beekeepers in the south west were worst hit, with more than half (53%) of colonies lost, while all areas of England saw significantly higher losses than last year, the survey showed. And the situation may have worsened since the survey was completed at the end of March, as bees have continued to face bad weather and the late arrival of spring. David Aston, chairman of the BBKA, said: 'Those honeybee colonies which have survived the winter and are now prospering have done so in the main due to the careful nurturing through the winter by beekeepers who have spent much time and effort feeding and carrying out frequent checks on hives, incurring significant additional expense meeting the need to continually feed their bees. 'The training and education of beekeepers to be able to adapt their beekeeping practices to help their honeybees cope with this period of changing weather patterns is a high priority for all beekeeping associations.' Honeybee colonies which are suffering from poor nutrition become more vulnerable to disease and other stress factors. If colonies are smaller as a result of the poor summer, they can also find it harder to survive the winter as they cluster together in cold weather and can starve if the smaller cluster is not close to food stores within the hive.","The level of colony losses across England is more than double what it was last year .

"On one of the coldest days in decades, the last thing you would want to do is head out on a 29 mile walk.

Officer and a gentleman: Officer Andy Blimline gave James $80 to pay for his cab ride home after coming to cour in freezing temperatures having walked 29 miles overnight . Long walk to freedom: James walked 29 miles in subzero temperatures for his court appearance . The man told Lilburn Police Officer Andy Blimline that he received a ticket for a crash, but his car was totaled, so he began his journey to court at 1 a.m. The man who had been identified only as James, was afraid a warrant would be issued if he didn't show up. 'No way to get up there, so I walked,' he told Channel 2 news. The man asked to only be identified as James. 'As soon as the air hit my lungs it took my breath away because of the wind. That was the major thing, the wind,' James said. Christmas spirit: When cops saw how far James had walked for his court appearance in atrocious conditions, they clubbed together to pay for his cab fare home . Police said they aren't sure how he survived the 8-hour journey. Officer Andy Blimline was inside the courthouse when James came in, huffing and puffing from the cold. 'I was just joking with him, and I said, 'What, did you run here?'' Blimline told HLN. 'No, I walked,' James replied. Temperatures on Tuesday morning plunged to 6 degrees, with Wind chills making the air feel like 10 degrees below zero - the coldest temperature since February 1996.

At first he said no, but I told him I wouldn't take no for an answer.' James adamantly refused, but Blimline the officers chipped in to pay for the $80 ride.

"Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal will head straight into his new Old Trafford role after the World Cup and his settling-in period has been made more straightforward after he bought a house in nearby Cheshire. While Van Gaal has been away at the World Cup in Brazil managing his native Holland, he has left domestic matters in the hands of his wife Truus, who has selected a property for the family. Van Gaal’s wife has been spotted house-hunting in the Alderley Edge area in recent weeks and Sportsmail understands that the Van Gaals’ put down a deposit on a property around ten days ago. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Manchester United target Vermaealen trains alone in fitness bid . Done deal: Louis van Gaal has already bought his house in Cheshire . On the ball: Van Gaal's wife Truus (centre) has been searching in the area for a few weeks . On the ball: And she appears to have found her dream home . The new United boss will move into the plush area in Cheshire that is known as the Golden Triangle, with Hale, Wilmslow and Alderley Edge among the most exclusive and glamorous areas in the north-west. Van Gaal will be close by to star players such as Wayne Rooney, David De Gea and Juan Mata. The Dutchman is determined to have no distractions once he begins his new job at Old Trafford and this news follows Sportsmail’s revelation on Sunday that Van Gaal has decided not to take a holiday following the World Cup. Instead, he will go into his role at Old Trafford within just a couple of days. The Dutchman has been in charge of the Netherlands for the World Cup in Brazil but despite the intense nature of the tournament, it is understood that Van Gaal has informed United officials that he will not require a break, even if Holland reach the final of the competition on July 13. United fly out to the United States for their pre-season tour on July 17 but Van Gaal would not return to Europe until July 15 if his team were to compete in the final of the World Cup in Brazil. Neighbour: Van Gaal will be living near the recently returned Wayne Rooney . Proximity: As well as his new No 1 keeper David de Gea . It could mean that the Dutchman has less than 48 hours between leaving South America and assuming full responsibilities as manager of Manchester United. There is also the possibility that United will present Louis van Gaal in a press conference before the club head off to the USA for glamour games against LA Galaxy, Roma, Inter and Real Madrid, meaning that the 62-year-old could have an exhausting schedule lying in wait. It is also expected that United will have a host of commercial events in store once they land in the USA. Van Gaal, meanwhile, has been in constant discussions with executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward during his involvement with the World Cup and he is understood to be delighted with the progress United have made in the transfer window, after the club this week sealed the signings of midfielder Ander Herrera and defender Luke Shaw. Both new players will join up with the squad on the tour of America while players who exited the World Cup in the group stages, including Danny Welbeck, Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata, David De Gea and Shinji Kagawa will be expected to be available to play from the second game of the tour. Van Gaal had initially expected to be without the club’s England stars for the majority of the trip as it is normal practice for World Cup players to be given a four-week break following their elimination from the tournament. VIDEO Luke Shaw signs for Manchester United . Additions: Man Utd have already added Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw to the squad . Allies: Van Gaal with Robin van Persie in training . However, Van Gaal will now have a chance to meet the majority of his squad far earlier as the players have been informed that they must be ready to play against Roma in the second game of the tour in Denver on July 26. Despite Holland’s involvement in the latter stages of the World Cup, striker Robin van Persie is understood to be keen to head out on the pre-season tour to be alongside close ally Van Gaal. However, it is expected that he will be encouraged to take a proper break to recharge his batteries ahead of the new season. Upon returning to Manchester, Van Gaal’s first port of call will be to have discussions with new assistant manager Ryan Giggs as the pair look to shape their squad as they embark on their debut campaign in charge at Old Trafford.","Van Gaal buys his house in Cheshire ahead of move to Manchester .

"Former senator John Edwards launched a verbal attack on his mistress Rielle Hunter when he found out she was pregnant, calling her a 'crazy slut', his former aide testified today. Taking the stand for the second time, Andrew Young told the court Edwards was 'very angry and concerned' when he found out about the baby in 2007 and told Young there was only a one-in-three chance the baby was his. He also told the court about the intricate system of check writing used to hide funds given to Edwards my millionaire Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon, which he said 'felt and smelled wrong' even though he was assured it was all legal. Family support: Former U.S. Senator John Edwards arrives with his daughter Cate at the federal court house in Greensboro today for the second day of his trial . Second testimony: Andrew Young, left, the federal government's key witness in the criminal campaign finance case against  Edwards, arrives at court today . It also emerged today that Edwards' secret weapon in the trial is his Harvard law graduate daughter Cate - . who was said to have been whispering legal advice in her father's ear . throughout jury selection and opening statements - in which the . prosecution called him a 'master manipulator'. When Andrew Young returned to the witness stand today, he said he worried about secretly using money from wealthy donors to support the former U.S. Senator's pregnant mistress during the candidate's 2008 presidential bid. 'It just all seemed crazy. It felt and smelled wrong,' he said. Young is the federal government's key witness in the criminal campaign finance case against Edwards, who failed to capture the Democratic presidential nomination. The former aide was granted immunity from prosecution for his testimony. Young told jurors how he coordinated three-way phone calls between himself, Edwards and Hunter to keep the affair secret from Edwards' wife, Elizabeth. Hunter also met up with John Edwards at hotels on the campaign trail, Young said. Hunter for a time worked as a videographer for Edwards' campaign, but she lost her job after Edwards' wife found out about the affair. Key witness: On his second day on the stand, Andrew Young, said Edwards assured him the money coming from wealthy donors was legal . Young said he and Edwards tried to . figure out where they could get money to support her and eventually . settled on heiress Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon, an Edwards admirer who is now . 101. Mellon had offered to help Edwards . with campaign expenses after he took a beating in the press for his . expensive haircuts. Young said he did not tell her the money would be . used to cover expenses for Edwards' mistress, who had threatened to go . public about their relationship. 'I told (Mellon) that we had a . non-campaign expense that would benefit Mr Edwards, and we needed her . help,' Young told the court. Cate Edwards is seen as the secret weapon in her father's trial . Mellon eventually wrote seven checks . totaling $725,000 to her interior decorator. The decorator then sent the . checks to Young's wife to co-sign using her maiden name, Young said. In the checks' memo lines, Mellon used descriptions such as 'chairs' and 'antique Charleston table', government exhibits showed. Edwards says he did not know about . the money from Mellon, but Young said the two men discussed seeking the . payments and whether the arrangement using the decorator and Young's . wife was legitimate for a presidential campaign. 'He said it was completely legal, that it was a non-campaign expense,' Young said. He has not yet discussed how other payments from campaign finance chairman Fred Baron came about. Edwards' defense is expected to go . after Young's credibility during cross-examination. During opening . statements on Monday, the defense said Young pocketed most of the donor . money and used it to help bankroll a $1.5 million home for his family. Young thought Edwards was his 'ticket to the top', the defense said. When things soured, he recruited others to testify against Edwards in the criminal prosecution, according to the defense. The defense also tried to undermine him yesterday by revealing that he had a one-night stand with another witness in 2007. Violation of federal law: Andrew Young pictured with his wife Cheri contacted three witnesses in the John Edwards criminal trial to ask about their possible testimony said the judge in the trial yesterday . Possible defence witness: Rielle Hunter, the former mistress of John Edwards, enters the federal courthouse in Raleigh, North Carolina, Thursday, August 6, 2009 with the pair's child Frances Quinn Hunter . U.S District Court Judge Catherine C. Eagles said that former Edwards aide Andrew Young slept with a young . campaign employee and also contacted three other witnesses in the past . two weeks to consult with them about their planned testimony. Prosecutors say Edwards, 58, . manipulated Young into soliciting more than $900,000 from two wealthy . donors to hide the affair and pregnancy, and avoid destroying his . campaign. John Edwards leaves the federal court house after his second day on trial, which is expected to last six weeks . They say Young was so dedicated to . Edwards that he agreed to falsely claim paternity of mistress Rielle . Hunter's baby at Edwards' request. According to the New York Post, Cate Andrews sat directly behind her father yesterday in the federal . courtroom in Greensboro, North Carolina. Edwards and his attorneys consulted . with her at least six times in the 45 minutes it took to whittle down 45 . jurors to the final 16, almost making her the fourth member of his . legal team. Cate was also active during Edwards . campaign for presidency in 2008. She temporarily gave up practicing law . after her mother Elizabeth died from breast cancer in December 2010. She now runs the Elizabeth Edwards Foundation, which provides educational opportunities to underprivileged children. The judge ruled that lawyers for Edwards . could mention the improper contact to . jurors in opening arguments on Monday, but barred them from using the term . 'witness tampering' or telling the jury that Young had a one-night . stand with one of the other witnesses in 2007. 'It wasn't just a marriage on the . line,' said prosecutor David Harbach. 'If the affair went public it . would destroy his chance of becoming president, and he knew it. ...He made a . choice to break the law.' The judge seated 12 jurors and four alternates Monday morning. The panel is . made up of nine men and seven women drawn from central North Carolina, the . state that elected Edwards to serve one term in the U.S. Senate. Each had already given Edwards' campaign the maximum . $2,300 individual contribution allowed by federal law. Edwards denies having known about the . money, which paid for private jets, luxury hotels and Hunter's medical care. Prosecutors will seek to prove he sought and directed the payments to cover up . his affair, protect his public image as a 'family man' and keep his . presidential hopes viable. Heiress: Bunny Mellon, right, is one of the wealthy donors who allegedly provided Edwards with almost $1million to cover up his affair . Motherly love: Edwards helps his mother Bobbie Edwards as they leave the federal court house today where she supported him in his trial . It is alleged as part of this, Young and his wife invited the pregnant . Hunter to live in their home near Chapel Hill and later embarked with her on a . cross-country odyssey as they sought to elude tabloid reporters trying to . expose the candidate's extramarital affair. Former aide Young later fell out with Edwards and . wrote an unflattering tell-all book, 'The Politician.' And just recently, Young and Hunter ended a two-year legal battle over ownership of a sex tape the . mistress recorded with Edwards during the campaign, agreeing to a settlement . that dictates that copies of the video will be destroyed. While Young is expected to be a witness for . the prosecution, the defense is likely to call Hunter to testify. After years of adamant public denials, . Edwards acknowledged paternity of Hunter's daughter, Frances Quinn Hunter, in 2010. The girl, now 4, . lives with her mother in Charlotte and is visited frequently by Edwards. And despite rumours Edwards and Hunter were looking to get married, a recent sighting reported to the New York Post claims the one-time secret romance is no more. The old flames were seen eating together at . Rooster's Wood Fire Kitchen in Charlotte where they often take their . daughter Frances Quinn, four, and apparently looked far from a couple in . love. A staff member at the restaurant said: 'They . didn't seem romantic. You would think that they were a married couple . if you didn’t know them. He sat across from her in a booth.' Hunter's publicist Rosemarie Terenzio confirmed the couple see each other often but not romantically. She . told the Post: 'No, she wasn’t ever engaged to him. They see each other . often. They raise Quinn together and they do so extremely amicably.'","Former Democratic presidential contender called a 'master manipulator'

"Victoria's Secret new Perfect Body campaign, which features ten very slim, tall models in its new Body bra line, came under some serious scrutiny last week. The brand faced a backlash  amid claims it's 'body shaming' and is promoting unrealistic, negative body images by suggesting the 'perfect' body is tall and slender. Today, fashion retailer JD Williams  spoke out against Victoria’s Secret's latest marketing campaign branding it exclusive and misguided. Scroll down for video . Hitting back: In response to Victoria's Secret's 'perfect body' campaign, JD Williams has launched a #PerfectlyImperfect campaign to promote body confidence for all women, of all ages, sizes and shapes, which they say promotes beauty as a source of confidence . The campaign, promoting the hashtag #PerfectBody and claiming to provide the perfect fit and comfort, has been accused of using a toxic combination of super slim models and expert airbrushing to create an image of perfection unattainable for most women. In response, JD Williams, a brand that Lorraine Kelly designs a range for, has launched a #PerfectlyImperfect campaign to promote body confidence for all women, of all ages, sizes and shapes. They say their campaign includes an image with a crucial point of difference - the models range from a size 10 to size 16, which they say promotes beauty as a source of confidence. The brand hopes that by asking women to share their #FavouriteFlaw on social media channels they will be inspired to share the things they love about themselves and encourage others to look at their own bodies in a positive light - in a celebration of real beauty. Original campaign: The Victoria's Secret campaign, promoting the hashtag #PerfectBody and claiming to provide the perfect fit and comfort, has been accused of using a toxic combination of super slim models and expert airbrushing to create an image of perfection unattainable for most women . Ed Watson, a spokesperson for the retailer, said: “We have a responsibility as a retailer to promote positive body image to our customers and that means being representative of women in the UK.' Susan Rigland, CEO of eating disorder charity BEAT, added: 'We are delighted to see JD Williams taking such a positive stance against the negative influence of the ""perfect fit"". We know perfection doesn't come in one size or shape, and how harmful it can be to pretend it does. 'We know that fashion has what it takes to get real and get in touch with what people want- images that show real health, real beauty and real lives.' People have objected so strongly to the Victoria's Secret campaign that a petition has even been fronted by British students Frances Black, Gabriella Kountourides and Laura Ferris via change.org, demanding an apology from the American underwear company. Petition: People have objected so strongly that a petition has even been fronted by British students Frances Black, Gabriella Kountourides and Laura Ferris via change.org - and it has over 20,000 supporters . The trio write: 'Every day women are bombarded with advertisements aimed at making them feel insecure about their bodies, in the hope that they will spend money on products that will supposedly make them happier and more beautiful. 'All this does is perpetuate low self-esteem among women who are made to feel that their bodies are inadequate and unattractive because they do not fit into a narrow standard of beauty. It contributes to a culture that encourages serious health problems such as negative body image and eating disorders. 'Victoria’s Secret’s new advertisements play on women's insecurities, and send out a damaging message by positioning the words 'The Perfect Body' across models who have exactly the same, very slim body type. 'This marketing campaign is harmful. It fails to celebrate the amazing diversity of women’s bodies by choosing to call only one body type 'perfect'. 'Victoria’s Secret is hugely popular among young women, and they have a crucial responsibility to not use harmful and unhealthy ideas to market their products. We would like Victoria’s Secret to take responsibility for their irresponsibility. 'We’re asking them to change the advertisements and pledge not to use such marketing in the future.'

"To some, the Des Plaines Oasis is just a glorified food court with hungry truckers and greasy snacks. But for 21-year-old Kevin Walters, the glass pavilion straddling the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway in Illinois means so much more - he claims it's the site of his conception. So when news broke that the highway rest stop would close on Sunday after more than 50 years to make way for new roads, the Crystal Lakes resident handcuffed himself to a door in protest. 'It is a weird story, I must . admit,' Walters said, according to CBS Chicago. 'About 21 years ago, my parents were . at a Phil Collins concert here in Chicago, and one thing led to another.

"Lighting storms are impressive displays of nature's power - but up until now scientists hadn’t realised that they could also sculpt mountains. A team of researchers from Johannesburg recently discovered that a single lightning bolt could, for example, blow . three to 10 cubic metres (100 to 350 cubic feet) out of bedrock. This . goes against the current assumptions that the peaks above 3,050 metres . (10,000ft) tend to break down over hundreds of thousands of years. Lighting storms are impressive displays of nature's power - but up until now scientists hadn't realised that they could also sculpt mountains . The discovery was made by Professor Stefan Grab while studying the Drakensberg mountains in Lesotho, southern Africa. Previous theories claim that water melting and freezing inside cracks causes the rocks on mountains to break into pieces as they expand and break off. The Wind River Range, the Sierra Nevada and the Rocky Mountains were thought to have been shaped in this way, for example. But unlike these formations, Professor . Grab believes that lightning was the main cause behind the creation of . the mountain landscapes in southern Africa . In Lesotho's Drakensberg mountains, for instance, the team found that a single lightning bolt could blow three to 10 cubic metres (100 to 350 cubic feet) out of bedrock . New research done on the Drakensberg mountains in South Africa debunks previous suggestions that cold temperatures played a dominate role in mountain formation . The hit: Lighning strickes the rock surface. The heat - which is around 27760 ºC - vapourises water that is stored in the cracks. The explosion: The force of the vapourised water explosed the rocke, moving 10 tonnes of debris as far as 10 metres (30 feet) away. New cracks help to continue the process of weathering. In Lesotho's Drakensberg mountains, for instance, the team found that a single lightning bolt could blow three to 10 cubic metres (100 to 350 cubic feet) out of bedrock. This goes against the current assumptions that the peaks above 3,050 metres (10,000 feet) tend to break down over hundreds of thousands of years. His team used a compass to prove their theory. ‘A compass needle always points to magnetic north,’ said Professor Grab's colleague Professor Jasper Knight. ‘But . when you pass a compass over a land’s surface, if the minerals in the . rock have a strong enough magnetic field, the compass will read the . magnetic field of the rock, which corresponds to when it was formed. ‘In the Drakensburg, there are a lot of basalt rocks which contain a lot of magnetic minerals, so they’ve got a very strong magnetic signal.’ If a compass is passed over an area where a lightning strike occurred, its needle will suddenly swing through 360 degrees. ‘The energy of the lightning hitting the land’s surface can, for a short time, partially melt the rock and when the rock cools down again,’ added . ‘It takes on the magnetic imprint of today’s magnetic field, not the magnetic field of millions of years ago when the rock was originally formed.’ Because of the movement of continents, magnetic north for the newly formed rock will be different from that of the older rock around it. Professor Knight and Professor Grab mapped out the distribution of lightning strikes in the Drakensburg and discovered that lightning significantly controls the evolution of the mountain landscapes because it helps to shape the summit areas with this blasting effect. Previously, angular debris was assumed to have been created by changes typical of cold, glacial environments, such as fracturing due to frost. Water enters cracks in rocks and when it freezes, it expands, causing the rocks to split apart. ‘Many . people have considered mountains to be pretty passive agents, just . sitting there to be affected by cold climates over these long periods of . time,’ said Professor Knight. ‘This . evidence suggests that that is completely wrong. African mountain . landscapes sometimes evolve very quickly and very dramatically over . short periods of time. These are actually very sensitive environments . and we need to know more about them.’ Previously, angular debris was assumed to have been created by changes typical of cold, glacial environments, such as fracturing due to frost . The research team also attempted to quantify how much debris was moved by such blasts, which can cause boulders weighing several tonnes to move tens of metres. The stability of the land’s surface has important implications for the people living near the mountains. ‘If we have lots of debris being generated it’s going to flow down slope and this is associated with hazards such as landslides,’ said Professor Knight. Mountains are also inextricably linked to food security and water supply. In Lesotho, a country crucial to South Africa’s water supply, food shortages are leading to overgrazing, exposing the rock surface and making mountain landscapes even more vulnerable to weathering by lightning. Professor Knight hopes the research will help to put in place monitoring and mitigation to try and counteract some of the effects. ‘The more we increase our understanding, the more we are able to do something about it,’ he said.","Previous theories claim mountains break down over thousands of years .
This is said to be due to temperature changes in the mountainous rock .
Scientists now believe mountains in Africa were shaped by lightning .
They proved their theory by monitoring changes on a compass needle .

"Boxing legend Muhammad Ali has hit back at rumors that he is so ill he can barely speak, by tweeting a photo of his smiling self along with the words 'don't believe the hype.' The photo was posted online on Tuesday and features the three-time world heavyweight champion posing beside two women. 'Don't believe the hype. Feeling great earlier today at @BoarsHeadResort. #AliSelfie,' he tweeted. The Boar's Head is a 573-acre country estate and resort in Charlottesville, Virginia. Scroll down for video . Smile like you mean it: Boxing legend Muhammad Ali has hit back at rumors that he is so ill he can barely speak, by tweeting this photo along with the words 'don't believe the hype' Ali was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1984 but his condition has gradually deteriorated and he is now mostly housebound. Rumors about his ill-health grew after he was considered too ill to attend a premiere of a film about his life last week. His condition had meant he couldn't take part in the production of the movie either. His brother Rahman, 71, attended the screening of I Am Ali in Hollywood, and told The Sunday People: ‘I have not been able to talk to my brother about this because he is sick. ‘He doesn’t speak too well. But he is proud that we are here for him. He has given this film his blessing.’ Rahman Ali (third right) with brother Muhammad's daughters at last week's I Am Ali premiere . While his daughter Maryum, 46, who was also at the premiere, said her father would love the film and it will make him laugh and cry. Her sister Hana, 38, is planning to show the legendary boxer the new movie at his Arizona home later this month. Directed by Clare Lewins, the documentary movie gives unprecedented access to Ali’s personal archive of ‘audio journals’ as well as interviews with his family and boxers Mike Tyson and George Foreman, and put together to tell his life story. Nicknamed the Louisville Lip for his infamous wit, Ali remained active for several years after his diagnosis and made a moving appearance at the Atlanta 1996 Olympic Games where he lit the flame. However, the sporting icon, who retired from boxing after suffering several strokes, was seen looking particularly thin and frail at the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony where he was helped across the stage by wife Lonnie. In February 2013 his brother Rahman said Ali was so crippled by the degenerative brain condition that has afflicted many ex-boxers, he might not survive until the summer. Ali looks on as referee Zack Clayton counts out George Foreman in their title bout in Zaire in Octobe 1974 . Ali pictured at the Sports For Peace Fundraising Ball in London in 2012 (left) and in his heyday in 1974 (right) He also made claims that the family had been barred from seeing Ali, who is estimated to be worth more than £50million, and could only speak to him on the phone. Rahman said his brother was ‘a prisoner in his own home’ and he is being gravely mistreated by his wife because ‘she is more interested in Ali's money than his well-being’. However Ali’s daughter May May said she had spoken to her father that morning and he was fine, watching the Super Bowl at home in Arizona wearing a Baltimore Ravens jersey. 'He's fine, in fact he was talking well this morning,' she said in a telephone interview with CBS at the time. 'These rumors pop up every once in a while but there's nothing to them.' Muhammad’s son, Ali Jnr, said in January that he believes there is ‘no chance’ his father could survive another year. ‘I just want, hope and pray to God that this awful disease takes my dad sooner rather than later. Take him away from all the suffering he’s in.’ Ali, who was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 1984,  with wife Lonnie at an NFL game in New Orleans last year .

"New details have emerged about questionable recruitment practices at the US Military Academy at West Point, where prospective students were taken by a VIP party bus to a bowling alley, offered drinks and watched as two cheerleaders locked lips. The school has acknowledged the claims, which were first outlined in a news article published by the Gazette of Colorado Springs Sunday. Officials at West Point said the academy self-reported the recruitment violations to the National Collegiate Athletic Association, disciplined 20 cadets and reprimanded two officers, along with football coaches, for promoting underage drinking. Make out session: An internal report has revealed that two West Point academy cheerleaders (not pictured in this file photo) who were aboard a party bus with recruits in January made out with each other . The superintendent of the academy, Army Lt. Gen. Robert L. Caslen Jr, released a statement taking full responsibility for the incident. ‘I am fully committed to the values of West Point in all of our cadets and in all of our programs, and will ensure they are upheld to the highest of standards,’ Caslen stated. Accountability: The superintendent of the academy, Army Lt. Gen. Robert L. Caslen, Jr released a statement taking full responsibility for the incident . The rowdy, alcohol-soaked road trip took place back in January when 14 recruits boarded a party bus along with members of the football team and two cheerleaders, and headed down to the Palisades Mall in New York. The road-trippers made a pit stop at a bowling alley equipped with a bar, where the prospective students reportedly consumed large quantities of alcohol. The cadets allegedly ordered towers of beer for the recruits to drink, mostly paid for by booster money. Some attendees reportedly downed seven drinks in just 90 minutes. Two military police officers escorted the 'party bus' during the incident. The officers were later reprimanded following an internal investigation. On the way back to West Point, the internal report obtained by The Gazette described a 'club-like' atmosphere aboard the party bus, complete with loud music, flashing strobe lights and passengers dancing in the aisle. At some point during the ride, two cheerleaders began making out with one another, and also kissed a football player and one of the recruits. In addition to the boozy trip, the NCAA learned from the internal report that cheerleaders and female cadets had been set up as 'dinner dates' for recruits - a claim that has been disputed by Lt Gen Caslen. West Point spokesman Theresa Brinkerhoff said the academy did not publicly detail the incident at the time because it was handled 'administratively', the New York Daily News reported. The specific punishments for the officers, players and coaches have not been revealed, but no football players were kicked off the Army team, nor were any suspensions announced. Ms Brinkerhoff told the NCAA two members of the football staff had been removed from team activities for a week following the misbehavior. 'I believe those involved in this incident have learned from their mistakes, corrected their behavior accordingly, and will have the character to be the leaders our Nation expects of its West Point graduates,' Caslen said in the statement. West Point's top officer also took issue with allegations that booster money was used during the raucous outing. Caslen insisted that cadet host funds were distributed according to NCAA regulations, but the handling of those funds resulted in NCAA violations. The Army general added that the 54-seat charter bus used was escorted by a single New York state police officer in compliance with state law and that no military police escort was ever utilized. Star: The football players involved - which include Army starting quarterback Angel Santiago (above, number 3) - are expected to play against the Air Force Academy at West Point's Michie Stadium on November 1 . In a statement, Ms Brinkerhoff, speaking on behalf of the nation's oldest military academy, said that the cadets involved had been dealt with harshly. She told USA Today: 'Although seen as a minor infraction by the NCAA, the U.S. Military Academy takes this very seriously and adjudicated this at the highest level of the disciplinary code. 'We adjudicated this under Article 10 of the Cadet Disciplinary Code and all cadets appeared before the Commandant's Disciplinary Board.' The players involved, among them Army starting quarterback Angel Santiago, are expected to play against the Air Force Academy at West Point's Michie Stadium on November 1.","Cadets and two coaches have been disciplined at U.S. Military Academy .

"Fishermen in the EU are to be banned from the practice of removing sharks' fins before throwing the creatures back into the sea to die. Experts say 'shark-finning' is both cruel and a waste of resources. European Union nations today said they want all boats in their waters and EU-registered boats anywhere in the world to land sharks with their fins attached. The proposals still need the support of the European Parliament before they can become law. Some 75 million sharks a year are killed for the use of their fins only, with the EU being the biggest exporter . EU fisheries chief Maria Damanaki said the law would 'ease control and help us eradicate shark finning,' which she called cruel to the animals and a vast waste of resources. Sharks are vulnerable to over-exploitation because they mature late and give birth to small numbers of young at a time. Shark fins are in high demand in Asia for soup and alleged cures. Damanaki said some 75 million sharks a year are killed for the use of their fins only, with the EU being the biggest exporter. As a result, the hammerhead shark is as good as extinct in the Mediterranean Sea. Under current rules, the EU still has exemptions and special permits for the practice, and the enforcement is so convoluted it is prone to fraud. Damanaki has compared shark finning to killing elephants for their tusks only. Shark fins are in high demand in Asia for soup and alleged cures. A Blue Shark is pictured . The measures to better protect endangered sharks are part of an overall EU policy to promote sustainable fisheries after decades of overfishing have brought many popular species in the Atlantic and Mediterranean to the brink of commercial extinction. The meeting of the 27 fisheries ministers also sought support for a ban on the practice of discarding fish back into sea because they fail to meet qualifications or are commercially undesirable. The European Commission says up to half the whitefish and 70 per cent of the flatfish caught by fisheries are thrown overboard again. Damanaki and several member states want a wholesale ban on the practice but have been struggling to get everybody on board. France and Spain are said to be opposing a full ban. 'I'm worried that some countries may want to go slowly while others go fast,' said British Cabinet Secretary Richard Lochhead. 'Hopefully common sense will prevail.'",Proposals still need support of European Parliament before they become law .
"A police report has revealed the sickening sexual assaults Mama June's eldest daughter allegedly suffered at the hands of her boyfriend when she was just eight.

McDaniel was sentenced to 10 years behind bars after pleading guilty to child molestation. He left prison in March and has reportedly been seeing Mama June again. The abuse came to light after Anna told her elementary school teacher that her stepfather had assaulted her. She was able to describe the assaults in graphic detail, the report notes. The molestation was carried out multiple times between April and October 2002, according to the report. It took Anna months to speak out about the abuse because McDaniel had threatened to kill her if she told, RadarOnline reported. 'Anna stated that Mark told her not to tell because he would not like her anymore,' Beach continued. 'Anna advised she got tired of holding it in and had to tell.' Speaking to the National Enquirer in 2012, Anna's ex-boyfriend said: 'Anna told me that McDaniel threatened that if she ever told her grandparents what happened to her, he’d kill them and her.'

In June 2003, McDaniel was indicted for child molestation, aggravated child molestation and aggravated sexual battery in Henry County but the case was soon dropped. He was then indicted in Spalding County for rape, child molestation, aggravated child molestation, enticing a child for indecent purposes and aggravated sexual battery. Grand jurors accused McDaniel of showing Anna sexually graphic videos, fondling and sexually assaulting the girl, RadarOnline reported. As part of a plea deal, McDaniel only plead guilty to aggravated child molestation and was sentenced to 10 years. Anna, who is now 20 and married with a two-year-old daughter, revealed to People magazine that when she told her mother what McDaniel had done to her, June did not believe her. 'A week or so after it happened, I talked to Mama and she was upset, crying and saying, ""I don't believe you, I don't believe you, why would you do this to me?""' she remembered. Ignoring the scandal: Honey Boo Boo, left, and her sister, Jessica 'Chubbs' Shannon, right, are seen on Tuesday as they head out with their parents, Mama June and Sugar Bear . Day together: Sugar Bear and Mama June, both pictured today, split up earlier this year amid reports he had cheated on her - but reports this week suggest she actually cheated on him with McDaniel . 'And I was like, ""Mama, he did that to me and I can't do anything about it. You were never there to see it. You were always at work"".' After the assault, she moved to her grandmother's house and she only returned to live with her mother shortly before Here Comes Honey Boo Boo began, People reported. 'Me and Mama realized we needed to put this behind us and get our relationship back on track and that's what we did and that's what we have been doing,' she said. She said she doesn't know whether to believe reports that her mother is back together with McDaniel but, if it is true, 'I'm hurt'. Mama June has denied that she is dating the child molester. 'The statement of me dating a sex offender is totally untrue,' she said in a video posted at the weekend. 'I would not ever, ever, ever, ever put my kids in danger.' Moving on: Anna, left with her husband and right with their daughter, said she is hurt by reports that her mother could be back together with her abuser - and that they will not be allowed to come near her child . But photographs show June and McDaniel looking for houses in Griffin last month, while another image shows him touching her daughter, Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Shannon, who is just nine. Despite her protests, TLC has announced that they were cancelling the series because of Shannon's relationship with McDaniel. A friend of Alana's father, Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson, told MailOnline that he is gearing up for a custody battle after learning that Mama June has allowed McDaniel to come into contact with her. On Monday, RadarOnline reported that Child Protective Services in Georgia have opened an investigation into whether any crimes have been committed involving Mama June's three minor children - Alana, Lauryn 'Pumpkin' Shannon, 14 and Jessica 'Chubbs', 17.","Anna 'Chickadee' Shannon told police in 2003 that she had done the 's word' with Mark McDaniel, her mother's boyfriend .

"Mitt Romney has made millions of dollars through a tax loophole in the Netherlands, it was claimed today. The Republican presidential candidate received the money through his continued involvement with Bain Capital, the private-equity company he established in 1994 before launching his political career. Mr Romney received a severance deal when he departed the firm in 1999 that paid him in capital gains tax rather than a salary, according to a report by the website Follow The Money and Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant. This means that the GOP candidate would have to pay significantly less tax. Thumbs up: Mitt Romney greets supporters while boarding his campaign plane after a rally at Orlando Sanford international airport in Florida today. It was today claimed that he has made millions of dollars through a tax loophole in the Netherlands . It has also emerged that Mr Romney and his wife Ann were allowed to continue investing in Bain until at least 2009 and were still receiving tax-free income in 2010 and 2011. The Netherlands connection is complicated but boils down to the country offering huge tax breaks to multi-national firms such as Bain, which is reported to have avoided $100million (80million euros) in dividend taxes there. Bain managed this by, in 2004, investing in the Irish pharmaceutical company Warner Chilcott. At the time it was registered in Bermuda, but it moved to Ireland five years later after Barack Obama's administration cracked down on the island's tax breaks. In 2010, Bain moved its interest in Warner Chilcott to Dutch firm Alter Domus, which provides administrative services for multi-national companies. If a Dutch company owns more than 5 per cent of the shares in another firm, then that firm is exempt from paying capital gains tax. The report claims that there is a discrepancy between Mr Romney's tax filings in the U.S. and the tax-exempt shares worth $450,000 that he donated to his son's charity the Tyler Foundation in 2011. Big business: Mr Romney received a severance deal when he departed Bain Capital in 1999 that paid him in capital gains tax rather than a salary, it is alleged . The investigators came to their conclusions by studying Bain's tax returns, Mr Romney's own tax filings and Dutch Chamber Of Commerce documents. According to an investigation by Bloomberg News published last month, Mr Romney has benefited from a now-outlawed loophole that enables him to use the tax-exempt status of the Mormon church to reduce his own tax bill. Then the chief executive officer of Bain Capital, he set up the arrangement in June 1996, the year before Congress clamped down on the practice. As someone whose arrangements were already established, he was allowed to keep them in place. Called a charitable remainder unitrust, it is one of several strategies Mr Romney has adopted to reduce his tax bill. Such tax avoidance is legal and common among very rich people but it has been turned into an issue by the Obama campaign. In the second presidential debate, President Barack Obama slammed Mr Romney for paying 'lower tax rates than somebody who makes a lot less'. In this case, Mr Romney used the tax-exempt status of Mormon Church to defer taxes for more than 15 years. While Mr Romney will benefit, the trust will probably leave the church with less than what the law now requires, according to tax returns obtained by Bloomberg this month through a Freedom of Information Act request. Charities don’t usually owe capital gains taxes when they sell assets for a profit and trusts like Mr Romney’s permit funders to benefit from that tax-free treatment. Mr Romney has donated tens of millions of dollars to charities, principally the Mormon church.","GOP candidate receives the money through his involvement with Bain Capital, the private-equity company he established in 1994 and left in 1999 ."
"With the current president a product of an interracial marriage, it's easy to forget how recently miscegenation was taboo in the United States and how mixed-race couples still face hardships today. Photographer Yael Ben-Zion illustrates the modern challenges facing these couples in new book 'Intermarried'. The origins of 'Intermarried' go all the way back to 2007 when she was working on a different project, and interviewed former opera singer Beatrice Rippy at her home, coming across some family pictures. ""Frames"" Photographer Yael Ben-Zion first started Intermarried in 2009, inspired by family photos she encountered interviewing a former opera singer who had married outside her race at a time when the practice was banned in 20 states . 'Her late husband Carroll Hollister, was a piano player, and from the many family photos in her apartment, I realized they were intermarried.' Out now: Ben-Zion's latest book is available for order on Amazon . While they didn't initially talk about Rippy's marriage, the idea stuck with Ben-Zion and a few years later she decided to start Intermarried. When Intermarried started to take shape, Ben-Zion asked Rippy about her marriage to Carroll in the 1950s, when interracial marriages were banned in more than 40 U.S. states. 'In response, she put on her great smile and told me that they always did things their way.' Unfortunately, Ben-Zion was never able to sit down with Rippy for a long interview about her marriage since she passed away soon after. Thankfully though, Ben-Zion was able to speak with many more couples, starting by first contacting a parenting group in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Upper Manhattan. Many of the couples identified themselves as mixed and allowed Ben-Zion into their homes to take pictures of their families and the spaces they shared together. For some, the act of marrying someone outside of their race or religion meant offending their family. Take Jeff and Ilana Previdi for example. Jeff is Catholic and Ilana Jewish and when they first married her mother and sister refused to attend the wedding. While Jeff's family showed up for the big day, they were just as critical of the union. ""West Side Story"" Families angered: When Catholic-born Jeff Previdi married his Jewish wife Ilana, her parents refused to attend the wedding and his parents were concerned the children would be Jewish . ""The Little Prince"" Translation: Mixed-race families allowed Ben-Zion into their homes to document their living spaces. Above two versions of the children's book 'The Little Prince', one in Hebrew and the other in French . ""Morena and Blankito"" Mother and son time: Joselin Athanasios and her son recline on the couch at home . 'When Jeff told them he wanted to marry me, they did not support it and expressed concern that they would have Jewish grandchildren.' While both families were concerned about the religious background of any possible grandchildren, it was little Annabel's birth in 2006 that actually brought them together in the end. Jeff and Ilana's mothers met for the first time at the hospital the day their daughter was born. For other couples the 'mixing' is less dramatic. Kari Steeves and husband David Sklar celebrate both Hanukkah and Christmas, which means double the presents. ""Hanukkah candles and Advent wreath"" The upside of having parents with both Christian and Jewish backgrounds? Double the presents during holiday season . ""Murphy bed"" Family time: An interracial couple recline on a Murphy bed with their young child . ""I'm the French + Scottish"" Fusion: The child in the picture above describes himself as part French, part Scottish . And while Aditi Thapar was born in India, and her husband John Leahy back in the U.S. - they still find many commonalities between their respective upbringings. 'Despite our upbringing across the world, there were a remarkable number of similarities. It is pretty scary how similar out parents are and how similar our experiences were growing up,' John said. Overall, Ben-Zion hopes her latest book will create a 'platform for thinking and talking about issues that are very personal but have cast social and political implications'. Intermarried is available to order on Amazon. ""Baptism"" Shared faith: While Ewelina and her husband Richard come from different continents, they share a Catholic faith . ""Sari scarf and doll house"" Despite being raised in India and Oregon respectively, Aditi Thapar and John Leahy say their parents are similar and they share many of the same experiences growing up . ""Drawing rings"" No diamonds: Jeanne Verdoux and Scottish husband John Gibson drew rings on their fingers when they got married .",Yael Ben-Zion started compiling the book after coming across family photos of an intermarried family .
"There is confusion over who developed a new computer super-virus after some programmers today reportedly said the coding was the same relatively simple language as found in video games like Angry Birds. The suggestion contradicts theories put forward by other experts who only yesterday said the virus, known as The Flame, was so sophisticated it had to have been developed by some of the world's top brains at the U.S.'s National Security Agency. To guard against the virus the United Nations is issuing its 'most serious warning', but now some say element of the virus - known as malware -  are baffling. Simplistic: Experts have today raised question marks over the sophistication of new computer bug Flame, saying sections of the code used to produce it are the same as that used in video games like Angry Birds . According to msnbc reporter Bob Sullivan the program requires 20 megabytes - a comparably large size for a computer virus and an indicator of sluggish coding. Furthermore unlike the computer bug Stuxnet, Flame has so far failed to make a security breach comparable to hacking into a nuclear power plant. Most notably sections of the code were used the Lua programming language which is almost whollly used to create video games such as the hugely popular Angry Birds. Warnings have previously been put out claiming that the virus has the capability to cripple nations and the bug has been used to hack into computers in Iran. The sophisticated spyware – said to be about 100 times the size of most malicious software – also hacked other machines in the Middle East, including Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and Egypt. Lua, which was developed in Brazil, is generally considered to be a simple computer language, developed for the primary purpose of scripting video games. According to an Israeli programmer, quoted by msnbc, it was 'weird' to imagine the Lua language being used as a tool for spying. He said the code was so 'ordinary' it looked like the efforts of an 'average programmer'. Dangerous? This screen grab taken shows a section of code from the computer virus known as The Flame. program of the computer virus known as Flame . The language was named Lua after the Portuguese word for moon and reflects the idea of it being used as a subsidiary form of coding to attach satellite projects to bigger bits of software. Marcus Carey, who worked as a security analyst at the National Security Agency for eight years, said Lua was quite commonly used to power mobile applications such as Angry Birds. Mr Carey dismissed suggestions that the virus had been released by a government to spy on other nations. However, this view is contradicted by those such as Moscow-based . internet security firm Kaspersky Lab ZAO who has claimed that Flame was crafted at the . behest of a national government. Finger-pointing in Israel's direction, fuelled by the fact that the majority of cases so far discovered were in Iran, have not been strongly disputed as yet, but some believe the middle-east nation lacks the capacity to launch such an cyber attack. The argument appears to boil down to two schools of thought. Some say Flame's authors were being exceedingly clever by using an unusual programming language to develop a deadly piece of malware in an attempt to confuse hi-tech security systems. Others say those behind the superbug were amateurs who did little to do much to cover their tracks.","Cyber experts refute claims that code is spy tool .

"An ambitious mother who has one son and one daughter with albinism says she is certain both of them will be stars, and is encouraging them to believe they can do anything to which they set their minds. Lisa Needham, 43, and her husband Jim, 50, from Wolverhampton, both have the recessive gene for albinism, and of their three children - Matthew, 14, Jessica, 11, and Ben, seven - the youngest two are albino. But despite being devastated when they first discovered their children were affected by the genetic disorder which affects the skin, hair and eyes, the proud parents now feel that it's good to be different, and make sure they let their children know it frequently. In fact, both youngsters have begun to excel when it comes to sport and amateur dramatics, with Jessica eyeing up the stage and Ben keen to one day find himself in the Paralympic swimming pool. 'Meet the family' in video below... Jessica and Ben, both of whom suffer from albinism, at home with their mother Lisa . After Jessica was born, her parents decided to have another child, thinking that since they already had one daughter with albinism it might be nice for her to have a sibling with it as well . Lisa said: 'You go straight from thinking you have a child with nothing wrong who is going to run the country or play for Man United and then you discover there is a problem. 'You then start to think they're not going to go to school, have friends, get married, and will look and behave differently. 'But you soon realise that they can lead the way and will almost certainly achieve everything they set out to do.' Lisa and Jim are now confident they have prepared their son and daughter for their lives ahead. Their resolve to act was strengthened when they saw the TV documentary The Undateables, which featured an albino case study who could not find love. Matt, Ben, Jessica with their parents Lisa and James at their home in Wolverhampton . Despite being devastated when they first discovered their children were affected by the genetic disorder which affects the skin, hair and eyes, Lisa and Jim now feel it's good to be different . But it has been a difficult road and Lisa admits she was worried about how they would cope. They had no known relatives with the condition and were shocked when doctors gave them the news four weeks after Jessica left hospital. They already had an older son, Matthew, 14, who was born without albinism and had no indication they both carried the recessive gene. They later learned that Ben and Jess both have inherited oculo-cutaneous albinism which affects the hair, skin and eyes. It means Jessica has very poor eye-sight - especially in strong light - and must wear factor-50 sunscreen in sunny weather. The Needham family, Matt, Ben, Jessica with their parents Lisa and James at their home in Wolverhampton . Jessica loves singing and climbing, while Ben is a keen swimmer and keen to eventually swim in the Paralympics . Jessica is a keen performer and loves singing on stage . But the bubbly youngster has surprised everyone with her determined attitude to achieve in running, climbing and horse riding. Matt and Ben with their dad Jim in the garden at home . She also has ambitions to enjoy a career on stage and earlier this year performed with her school at the Royal Albert Hall. Jessica, who has just started secondary school, said: 'It was quite awkward at first to make friends at school because everyone was asking about my eyes and why I was so pale. But I told them why and they understood. 'Most of the hobbies I have are the same as everyone else's. I don't try to be different and I try to do everything I am capable of doing. 'I think my best skills are being up on stage and singing in front of people. When I'm up on stage I don't get stage-fright because I can't really see the crowd so don't get nervous. 'My mum and dad used to take me to the pantomime and I used to always wish I could be up there acting so since I started my stage school I have just tried to push myself forward instead of standing back and go for a singing part even if I doubt whether I should or not. 'Being a singer has been my dream all my life and I want to make it happen. So what I need to do is keep pushing myself forward and don't stand back from anything that could get in the way.' After seeing her flourish, Lisa and Jim decided to have another child, despite the possibility of the baby also having albinism. Eldest brother Matt holds baby Ben while sitting beside Jessica . Ben, left, suffers from albinism, but his older brother Matt, right, does not . They said albinism was already a big part of their lives and 'having another child with the same condition could only be a good thing'. Albinism is becoming more and more rare and the chances of a random couple having a child with albinism is one in 17,000. But confirmed carriers of the recessive gene will then have a one in four chance with future children. Jim recalls the nurses reaction to Ben's 'shocking, white hair' when he was born by caersarian - even though he had asked the medics not to mention anything to Lisa. He said: 'I just held Lisa's hand and said 'it will be OK'.' Little Jessica Holding her baby brother Ben shortly after his birth . Ben, pictured, and Jessica have to remain very covered-up when on holiday and always wear Factor 50 so they don't burn, as their skin is very sensitive . They took exactly the same approach with Ben, who is a keen swimmer with Paralympic aspirations. And the witty youngster has also have developed a close circle of friends and a close bond with their 'protective', older brother Matthew, 14, who was born without albinism and runs for the county. However, Lisa and Jim's main worries are yet to come as Jessica gets older and approaches her teenage years and become more self-conscious. Lisa said: 'My biggest fear of having a little girl with albinism was her looking different. I remember thinking to myself I can cope with her being blind but I couldn't cope with her looking different and people laughing or make fun. But Jess in fact has grown up not looking different to everyone else, but positively more beautiful. The comments we often get are 'look at her beautiful hair'. Big brother Matt is very protective of his younger siblings who both have albinism . Jessica running in a school sports race . However, Jess was a bit unhappy on their family holiday to Majorca two years ago when she had to wear a full UV swim suit to protect her skin at any time before 5pm. Lisa added: 'They will definitely become more self-aware the older they get but I had tried to assure them that it is quite good being different. 'It can get you further on in life because you will be noticed more. I tell them: 'If you want it, it is out there so push yourself further'. 'Being different is all part of that, so hopefully they have the grounding to use what they have got and take it forward.' Jessica as a baby dressed as Snow White . Albinism affects production of melanin, the pigment that colours skin, hair and eye, according to the NHS. People with albinism have a reduced amount of melanin or no melanin at all. Depending on the amount of melanin a person has, they may have very pale hair, skin and eyes, but some may have brown or ginger hair and skin that can tan. People with albinism usually have a number of eye conditions such as: . What causes albinism? Albinism is caused by a lack of the pigment melanin, which usually gives hair, skin and eyes their colour. In albinism, cells that produce melanin do not work because of genetic mutations (faulty genes). Different genes are responsible for the different types of albinism. Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is the most common type of albinism. Several different genes have been identified that may cause OCA.Diagnosing albinismAlbinism is usually obvious when a baby is born. As albinism can cause a number of eye conditions, your baby’s eyes will need to be examined to see how they are affected. They may be referred to an ophthalmologist (a doctor who specialises in diagnosing and treating eye conditions) for these tests.Treating albinismAlbinism itself does not need treatment, but the associated skin and eye problems it can cause do. Jess has to wear very strong sun cream when on holiday . A child with albinism will need regular eye tests and it is likely they will need to wear glasses or contact lenses to correct vision problems such as short-sightedness, long-sightedness and astigmatism. A person with albinism will need to take extra care in the sun. Without melanin in their skin, ultraviolet (UV) rays in sunlight can easily damage their skin (sunburn).OutlookAlbinism does not get worse and the condition does not alter a person's life expectancy. However, people with albinism have an increased risk of developing skin cancer. Babies with albinism often appear to have severe vision impairment, but their vision rapidly improves during the first six months. However, vision does not reach normal levels and the child will need extra support at school. They will otherwise do well in normal schooling. Albinism does not affect a child’s intelligence, but may affect their social development. For example, if they are bullied because they look different, they may find it difficult to make friends and play with other children in a group. This may be partly due to a tendency to invade other children's personal space by getting very close to see. They may also need help finding their friends across a crowded playground. Young children with albinism may also appear clumsy because their reduced vision can affect their ability to learn certain actions and movements, such as picking up an object or learning how to crawl. As the child develops, and with aids to help their vision, this should improve. The three Needham siblings on holiday .","Lisa and Jim Needham live in Wolverhampton with their three children .

Katie Medley (right) went into labor while her husband Caleb Medley (left) fought for his life after being shot in the Colorado movie theatre massacre . Katie Medley, who is quoted on a . fundraising website set up by friends, said someone entered through an emergency exit at the bottom of the theater and threw something over their heads. 'I thought it was a prank at first, or someone playing along with the movie because it happened during a fight scene,' she said. But then he opened fire and her husband was shot. 'I didn't know how he was, because . there was so much blood, but he was still moving, and he kept running . his fingers through his hair,' she recounted. She said her husband was the fourth . victim removed from the theater after police arrived. They put him in the back of a police car and drove him to hospital. Happier times: Caleb and Katie went to the Dark Knight Rises as one final date before the birth of their son . Fears: Caleb had won a stand up comedy contest days before he was shot in the face in the massacre . She added: 'I did not get to see him . again because the police were keeping me, and I did not find out if he . was still alive until they released me at about 4am.' The couple's friend, Michael West has set up a website dedicated to raising funds for Caleb to help out the family with the spiraling medical costs. The website has already raised over $186,000 and has a target of $500,000. 'Caleb doesn't have any insurance, so I put together a website,' said an emotional West. 'We talk to him because we know he can hear us and we tell him that he needs to get better because he needs to be a dad.' On Monday, as Caleb lay in critical . condition at University of Colorado Hospital, Katie was delivering their . son. She had changed the delivery location so she could be close to . him. Katie Medley's father, David Sanchez, . said his daughter and son-in-law had been waiting for a year to watch . the premiere of The Dark Knight Rises.

"The latest spell of warm, spring-like weather will continue throughout the weekend as temperatures are predicted to hit 19C tomorrow well over double the March average of 9C. Forecasters say the weather on Sunday will continue to be dry and warm for the south-east - with lengthy spells of sunshine. The pleasant weather in the south will continue well into next week - but north and westerly areas will see cloudy conditions and maybe even rain on Monday and Tuesday. The spell of warm weather in the south is expected to last until at least the end of the month. It is in stark contrast to this time last year when winter rolled on until the middle of the month. Blizzards left motorists stranded in 15ft snow drifts in Cumbria, while Belfast was blacked out after a storm hit the city’s power network, and temperatures plummeted to -6C (21F). York basked in the early 'summer' sunshine as forecasters said temperatures will reach 19C this weekend and the warm weather is set to last to the end of the month . A deer frolics in Richmond Park as warm weather hit the capital. Supermarkets said sales of burgers, sausages and barbecues have soared in recent days . Now pear trees at RHS Wisley in Surrey are in full blossom a month earlier than usual, which experts say is a sign that it could be an excellent year for all fruit. RHS fruit expert Jim Arbury said: ‘This is one of the earliest I can remember pears coming into blossom and might mean an early fruit harvest all round.’ While the past three months have been remarkably wet, the unseasonably mild temperatures have meant plants and wildlife were ready to wake when the good weather arrived. The early flowering is a big boost for butterflies and bees at the end of their winter hibernation. Retailers are also poised to take advantage of the unseasonably warm weather. Asda said sales of shorts have jumped 300 per cent in the past few days, barbecues are being snapped up and even sales of swimwear have risen 9 per cent.

A Met Office spokesman said the warm conditions - the south of England is forecast to be hotter than Cairo and Algiers this weekend - were a far cry from last March when the average temperature for the month was just 5.1C. Forecaster Nicola Maxey said: 'We are looking at temperatures in the mid to high teens, reaching 19C on the south coast tomorrow, with just showers of rain in the north west of Scotland.' Sunday will be dry and sunny, although a little cloudier than Saturday, and temperatures should stay relatively high until early next week, when they will drop back to 10C or 11C. A Waitrose spokesman said: 'This weekend’s mild temperatures are reflected in our sales figures, with burgers up 121 per cent, sausage sales also up 38 per cent, and a 700 per cent increase on our sales of garden plants compared to this time last year.' Managers at Tesco said they were expecting a rush on sausages, ice cream and berries, while at Marks and Spencer they said ice cream sales had already doubled on this time last week.

"Secretary of State John Kerry said on Wednesday that National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden 'has done great damage to his country' and if he were really a 'patriot' he would 'man up' and come back to the U.S.. Kerry was asked on the Today show about an interview Snowden did with NBC's Brian Williams in Moscow, Russia that airs in full tonight and was released in part last night. After Williams asked Snowden why he was in Russia, Snowden told Williams he should ask the State Department that question. Snowden said he never intended to stay there but was forced to because the government decided to 'revoke my passport.' Asked about Snowden's comments, Kerry told Today show host Savannah Gutherie that 'for a supposedly smart guy, that's a pretty dumb answer, frankly.' Secretary of State John Kerry told the Today show on Wednesday that if Snowden should come home and face the music. 'If he cares so much about America and he believes in America, he should trust the American system of justice,' Kerry said . Snowden leaked thousands of NSA documents last summer to reporters at British-based publication The Guardian. The former CIA technical analyst and defense contractor gave the reporters permission to print his name, saying 'I have no intention of hiding who I am because I know I have done nothing wrong.' 'My sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them,' Snowden told them. Within a week of publicly revealing himself as the source of the information, the U.S. Department of Justice charged Snowden with espionage, and a week later the State Department revoked his passport. Snowden was already in Hong Kong when he shared copies of NSA files with The Guardian. He had planned to travel to Ecuador but was detained during a layover in Russia. Without a passport, Snowden was unable leave the airport, and he ended up living there for more than a month. The Russian government eventually granted him temporary asylum, and he has been living there since last August. Snowden must reapply for asylum in Russia by the end of July if he wants to stay there. As of March, Snowden was seeking permanent asylum in European countries, but his efforts have been to no avail. On Wednseday Secretary Kerry said the U.S. would be 'delighted' to have Snowden back. 'If Mr. Snowden wants to come back to the United States today,' Kerry said on Wednesday, 'we'll have him on a flight today.' 'He should come back. That's what a patriot would do,' Kerry said. 'A patriot would not run away,' Kerry said. 'A patriot would stand up in the United States and make his case to the American people.' 'He can come home but he's a fugitive from justice, which is why he is not being permitted to fly around the world. It's that simple. And he knows it.' Kerry said Snowden 'stole an enormous amount of information' but it should be up to a court to determine if Snowden has engaged in wrongdoing. 'If he cares so much about America and he believes in America, he should trust the American system of justice,' Kerry said. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney made similar comments on the matter Wednesday morning to reporters traveling with the president. Carney reportedly said Snowden 'faces felony charges here in the United States and he ought to return here to face these charges.' In his first interview with a U.S. TV . network since leaking information from the NSA, Edward Snowden said many of the terms used . by the Obama administration to describe him were 'misleading' In his first interview with American media since fleeing the country, Snowden told Williams that he had a much larger role in U.S. intelligence than the government has acknowledged. ‘I was trained as a spy in sort of the traditional sense of the word, in that I lived and worked undercover overseas - pretending to work in a job that I'm not - and even being assigned a name that was not mine,' Snowden said in a portion of the interview that was broadcast on Tuesday. Snowden said that in his role at the NSA he 'developed sources and methods . for keeping our information and people secure in the most hostile and . dangerous environments around the world.' 'So . when they say I’m a low-level systems administrator, that I don’t know . what I’m talking about, I’d say it’s somewhat misleading,' he continued. On the Today show, Secretary of State John Kerry said he thinks Snowden's 'confused.' 'I think it's very sad,' Kerry said. Snowden's full interview with Williams airs tonight at 10 p.m. Eastern.","Edward Snowden gave his first interview to an American news outlet for a special that airs tonight .

"Trish Sen allegedly scratched the pilot's arms after being refused one last drink . A woman was restrained by a flight crew and forcefully taken off of a plane on Christmas eve after being refused one last drink. Trish Sen, 39, was on her way from Los Anegles, California to Fort Lauderale, Florida when she exhibited aggressive behavior and was met by local law enforcement upon arrival at around 6:00 am. She was then taken to Broward jail and released at $1,000 bail. ABC news reports that there was a dispute over what had actually happened on the flight. Some reports say Trish became angry after being refused a drink. Other reports say that she literally scratched the pilot. Sen says that she was merely trying to get back to her seat when the flight crew 'attacked her.' 'I was not drunk.' she told CBS. The police report details Sen's interaction with the pilot of the aircraft. 'He was scratched on both arms while trying to restrain suspect Sen who was disruptive and failing to comply with the flight crew's instructions while in flight. I did observe numerous scratches on the victim's arms,' the police report said. Jet Blue also released a statement, 'On December 23, a customer onboard Flt 100 LAX-FLL exhibited aggressive behavior and had to be restrained. Local law enforcement met the aircraft upon arrival. We are cooperating with law enforcement's investigation.' Sen went to the Fort Lauderdale court on Christmas day where she showed the judge the bruises up and down her arms.

"A jury on Friday convicted a 31-year-old man of killing and raping a University of New Hampshire college student following a trial filled with lurid details of sexual domination, experimentation and violence. The jury in Strafford Superior Court found Seth Mazzaglia guilty of first-degree murder in the death of 19-year-old Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott of Westborough, Massachusetts, in October 2012. The key witness, 20-year-old Kathryn McDonough, was Mazzaglia's girlfriend when she lured Miss Marriott to their apartment. She testified that Mazzaglia, a karate instructor, wanted another woman to join their sexual escapades, which included bondage and discipline. Scroll down for video . Defendant Seth Mazzaglia enters the courtroom with defense attorney Melissa Davis today in Dover, New Hampshire. He was found guilty of the 2012 murder of 19-year-old Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott, who was a student at the University of New Hampshire . Defendent Seth Mazzaglia, right, is lead from the courtroom on Friday after being convicted of first-degree murder. He will be sentenced to life in prison without the chance of parole . McDonough first told investigators that Marriott died during rough sex between the two women that involved restraints. After getting immunity from prosecution, McDonough changed her story and said Mazzaglia strangled Miss Marriott then raped her. Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott of Westborough, Massachusetts was choked to death by Seth Mazzaglia in 2012 . Mazzaglia was found guilty of one count of first-degree murder that stated he strangled Marriott 'before, after or while' sexually assaulting her. He also was convicted of conspiracy to falsify evidence and conspiracy to tamper with witnesses. He will be sentenced to life in prison without the chance of parole. Jurors began deliberating on Wednesday, after hearing 19 days of testimony. McDonough was on the stand for ten of those days. The trial hinged McDonough's credibility. Mazzaglia did not testify. McDonough initially told investigators that she killed Marriott during consensual sex but later said she made up that story because she loved Mazzaglia, thought they still had a future together and wanted to protect him. Defense lawyers, though, painted her as an opportunistic liar who killed Marriott then changed her story when she found out she could cut a deal and get less time in prison if she pinned the crime on her ex-boyfriend. The deal was conditioned on her testifying truthfully. In court, she testified that Mazzaglia . was the sexually dominant partner in their relationship and became . angry when she left for nearly two weeks at theater camp without . recruiting a sex partner for him. As what she called punishment, Mazzaglia told her to lure a woman - Marriott - to the apartment on October  9, 2012.

"Conservative firebrand Pat Buchanan insists that God is now on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s side. The bombastic pundit's claims in a rambling diatribe posted to a conservative website that Russia is the 'third Rome' and the West ‘is Gomorrah.' ‘Putin is planting Russia’s flag firmly on the side of traditional Christianity,’ Buchanan wrote in the op-ed published by Human Events, adding that his recent speeches echo those made nearly 20 years ago by Pope John Paul II – in which the pontiff also criticized the West. The 'third Rome': Former Republican presidential candidate Pat Buchanan (left) believes that Russian President Vladimir Putin (right) and God are on the same page in their fight against Western hedonism and opulence . Buchanan’s pro-Putin essay claims that Moscow is ‘the third Rome,’ a claim that goes back to the 12th century and the Byzantines, and the West is the source from which evils such as gay marriage tolerance, abortion acceptance and devil worshiping emanate. ‘Many Euro-Atlantic countries have moved away from their roots, including Christian values,’ he writes Putin said in a recent speech. ‘Policies are being pursued that place on the same level a multi-child family and a same-sex partnership, a faith in God and a belief in Satan. This is the path to degradation,’ Putin espoused. Buchanan also claims that Russia’s hostile takeover of Crimea is also part of the divine plan. ‘Western leaders who compare Putin’s annexation of Crimea to Hitler’s Anschluss with Austria… believe Putin’s claim to stand on higher moral ground is beyond blasphemous,’ writes Buchanan. ‘But Vladimir Putin knows exactly what he is doing.’ Fallen star: Buchanan's outspoken views saw him fall from rising star and Republican presidential candidate to being fired recently by MSNBC . The former-Republican-presidential candidate explains that Putin is ‘entering a claim that Moscow is the Godly City of today and command post of the counter-reformation against the new paganism.’ The fired former MSNBC commentator’s latest defense of the former Soviet strongman is using religion as the cloak for Russia’s military dagger. ‘The West’s capitulation to a sexual revolution of easy divorce, rampant promiscuity, pornography, homosexuality, feminism, abortion, same-sex marriage, euthanasia, assisted suicide,’ are the evils Buchanan believes Putin is fighting against. Moscow is the base from which the ‘cultural, social, moral war’ with the West is to be waged, claims Buchanan. Man of God: Buchanan claims Putin (pictured) is creating a new base of Christian values in Russia . ‘Where Russia’s role, in Putin’s words, is to “prevent movement backward and downward, into chaotic darkness and a return to a primitive state,’ he argues. Russia’s ‘flag planted firmly in the ground,’ according to Buchanan, is ‘a ban on homosexual propaganda, a ban on abortion advertising, a ban on abortions after 12 weeks and a ban on sacrilegious insults to religious believers.’ Proof of Russia’s new role as the arbiter of taste, according to Buchanan, is that the ‘World Congress of Families VII will be held in Moscow, Sept. 10-12.’ He even suggests Putin, despite rumors of marrying his mistress and having a secret family, might even give the keynote speech.","The former Republican presidential candidate wrote an opinion column that claims Putin is leading the fight against Western hedonism .
Russia's annexation of Crimea is part of Putin's master plan to fight the moral war against the west, Buchanan claims .
The former communist country's ban on 'homosexual propaganda' is cited as proof the battle is being won, according to Buchanan ."
"As we take our virgin steps into space, there is one thing that could always put a cap on our ambitions. Despite our desire to explore the stars, we are limited by travelling at less than light speed - and even if we managed to match that pace, we would still be listing our voyages from star to star in years, centuries or millenia. But, in what could be a huge breakthrough, theorists from Nasa say there is 'hope' that we can achieve faster-than-light travel, after physicists found a theoretical possibility for warp speed travel. Space time mapped out: Teams at NASA are exploring ways to warp the universe to enable faster than light travel. Pictured is a model of how a ship, enclosed in a space-time 'doughnut', could reach the stars . While nothing can break the speed of light, scientists have long considered the fantasy of warp speed travel, where spaceships could bend space and time on itself to move through loopholes in space. Equations based on the laws of relativity have allowed warp speed in theory: but the energy required to make it happen would require the energy-mass of a Jupiter-sized planet. Mexican physicist Miguel Alcubierre's theories are the most practical, mooting a ring around a sphere-shaped spaceship, which would contract space in front of the ship, and expand space behind it. This would allow faster-than-light travel - if astrophysicists could harness planet-sized energy or sip power from a supernova. The 100 year star ship symposium is investigating various means by which we can travel to the stars, hoping to find a happy medium between practical and far-fetched methods . But according to Space.com, Harold 'Sonny' White, from NASA's Johnson Space Center, told the 100 Year Starship Symposium, a gathering of scientists, writers and philosophers in Houston, that new theories could allow Man to reach such speeds with less energy. He told his audience that, instead of enclosing a space-ship in a space time-bubble, a craft could sit within a 'doughnut' shape - which means the warp drive could be powered by a mass the size of a spacecraft like the Voyager 1 probe - the equivalent size of a small car. He told Space.com: ''The findings I presented today change it from impractical to plausible and worth further investigation. 'The additional energy reduction realized by oscillating the bubble intensity is an interesting conjecture that we will enjoy looking at in the lab.' White and his team are experimenting with a mini-version of a warp drive in their laboratory, using laser to try to warp space and time in miniature. He said his 'humble experiment' was 'trying to see if we can generate a very tiny instance of this in a tabletop experiment, to try to perturb space-time by one part in 10 million.'","NASA suggests new model which could reduce energy requirements for warp-speed travel from planet-sized to car-sized .

"Once seen widely as a currency attracting criminals, its reputation is now soaring - not to mention its price. But users have reported several alarming recent thefts of Bitcoin, the digital currency taking the world by storm. Invented in 2009, the global currency's anonymity and lack of control from any government makes it ideal for digital entrepreneurs, but also a prime target for hackers. Vulnerable: Real-world bitcoins pictured in April. Hackers have attacked sites hosting the digital currency . In the most recent attack hackers stole 1,295 bitcoins worth more than $1 million from one of the world's biggest sites, the Coindesk news site reported. The criminals attacked the servers of the Denmark-based Bitcoin Internet Payment System (BIPS), wiping its data. They weakened the site by launching a catastrophic denial of service attack - where a server is bombarded with data until it collapses - before stealing the virtual currency. Chief executive Kris Henriksen said the attackers may have been from Russia and neighbouring countries, Coindesk reported. He wrote on the Bitcoin Forum: 'Please be advised that attacks are not isolated to us and if you are storing larger amounts of coins with any third party you may want to find alternative storage solutions as soon as possible.' Soaring: The value of Bitcoin in dollars has more than quadrupled in November. Source: CoinDesk Price Index . Security breach: Kris Henriksen, chief executive of the Danish Bitcoin Internet Payment System, said his site suffered a catastrophic hacking attack. He added: 'Several consumer wallets have been compromised' A statement on the firm's website said: 'BIPS has been a target of a coordinated attack and subsequent security breached. Several consumer wallets have been compromised and BIPS will be contacting the affected users. 'As a consequence BIPS will temporarily close down the wallet initiative to focus on real-time merchant processing business which does not include storing of Bitcoins. Suddenly the world is fascinated with Bitcoin - which has soared in value since the start of November. It is currently worth about $1,100 per coin and yesterday one coin was worth more than an ounce of gold for the first time, it's claimed. And it is hitting 'real life', with a cash machine in Vancouver, Canada, and a sushi restaurant in San Francisco dispensing and accepting the currency. The virtual money - whose value is determined by no government, instead by a peer-to-peer network of mainly anonymous users - was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. But that is not his real name - he, too, was anonymous. The inventor released the coding for his currency in open-source form, and users can now create their own bitcoins. It happens through a process called mining, which forces computers to solve algorithms so complex that the amount of power they take up limits how much currency can flood the market. Its value works just like any undefinable commodity, with the same potential pitfalls. In one of the most famous price bubbles, tulips took on enormous value in 17th Century Amsterdam with lovers of the flowers remortgaging their houses - before the price suddenly collapsed. 'BIPS will consider to reintroduce the wallet initiative with a re-architected security model.' Angry users of the currency took to forums to protest at the loss of their money, including an anonymous user who lost 90 bitcoins (about $100,000). The user said people who were affected should file a class-action lawsuit. He admitted Bitcoin was the 'wild west' of currency but said: 'I think it's reasonable, fair, and legal for the affected individuals to get together and try to negotiate as a group for some kind of compensation.' Meanwhile Czech website bitcash.cz had its entire balance stolen - which last month was estimated at about $100,000. A statement on the firm's website said: 'On November 11, in the evening, there was a security breach on our server. 'The unknown attacker managed to convert the entire... balances in users' wallets.' It also comes after Australian site TradeFortress claimed $1.3 million of Bitcoin were stolen three weeks ago - just as the currency's value began soaring. Several sites which have fallen victim to the hackers, including TradeFortress, have been forced to deny accusations of an 'inside job'. Such was the case with the Polish website Bidextreme, which put a long statement on its website last week. It said: 'It is understood that in this situation you expect a detailed explanation, but we cannot make public information such as what data has been lost, what has been recovered, at what stage the proceedings [are] because it will harm the investigation. 'Your speculation, allusions and often accusations directly, not having the slightest basis in reality and posted on the forum are very hurtful, bring chaos and anxiety, as well as damage [our] image.' We understand your bitterness, but . please refrain from drawing conclusions and issuing extrajudicial [action] until . the end of proceedings.' Global: Nara Sushi, a restaurant in San Francisco, has begun accepting Bitcoin despite the controversy . Meanwhile in a separate issue, an entrepreneur who makes physical bitcoins - Mike Caldwell, from Salt Lake City, Utah - suspended all new orders on Thursday over unspecified 'regulatory issues'. A statement on his blog said: 'For the time being, I have suspended accepting new orders, pending resolution of some concerns I have as to regulatory issues. 'I am anticipating a possibility of having to prequalify buyers, and am holding off taking orders until I know for sure.'","More than $2m stolen from Danish, Polish, Czech and Australian sites .

"A British firm has produced the first 'petrol from air', it emerged today - in a pioneering scientific breakthrough that could end mankind's reliance on declining fossil fuels. Air Fuel Synthesis in Stockton-on-Tees, Teesside, claims to have made five litres of petrol since August using a small refinery that synthesises the fuel from carbon dioxide and water vapour. Experts have hailed the incredible breakthrough as a potential 'game-changer' in the battle against climate change and solution to the globe's escalating energy crisis. Last year, British researchers claimed that they had also found the 'holy grail' of the green economy by producing petrol from air for the first time. Air Fuel Synthesis in Stockton-on-Tees, Teesside, made petrol using a small refinery that synthesises the fuel from carbon dioxide and water vapour . While the company is still developing their process and still need to take electricity from the national grid, it believes it will eventually be possible to power the synthesis entirely from renewable sources. Within two years it hopes to build a commercial-scale plant capable of making a ton of petrol a day and expand into producing green aviation fuel to make airline travel more eco-friendly. The technology involves mixing air with sodium hydroxide, then electrolysing the resultant sodium carbonate to release pure carbon dioxide. This is then reacted with hydrogen electrolysed from water to make a hydrocarbon mixture, with the reaction conditions varied depending on the type of fuel desired. The fuel that is produced can be made ready for use in any petrol tank with the addition of the same additives currently added to fuel. Alternatively it can be blended directly with gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel. Development stage: The company claims to have made five litres of petrol over the past few months, but they hope to move to a commercial-scale plant producing a ton a day within two years . This diagram illustrates the pioneering process for creating petrol from water . Peter Harrison, the company's chief . executive, revealed the breakthrough at a conference at the Institution . of Mechanical Engineers in London this week. 'We . are converting renewable electricity into a more versatile, usable and . storable form of energy, namely liquid transport fuels,' he told the . Independent. Air is blown into a tower filled with a mist of sodium hydroxide solution. The carbon dioxide in the air reacts with some of the sodium hydroxide to form sodium carbonate. This sodium carbonate is then electrolysed to release the carbon dioxide, which is collected and stored. A dehumidifier condenses water out of the same air passed into the tower, with this condensed water then passed into an electrolyser where it is split into hydrogen and oxygen. The carbon dioxide and hydrogren are reacted together to make a hydrocarbon mixture, with reaction conditions varied depending on the kind of fuel required. The product can then be mixed with the same additives used in current fuels to ease starting, burn cleanly and avoid corrosion problems. Otherwise it can be blended directly with gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel. 'We think . that by the end of 2014, provided we can get the funding going, we can . be producing petrol using renewable energy and doing it on a commercial . basis.' Extracting carbon dioxide from air - . effectively removing the principal industrial greenhouse gas from the . atmosphere - has been described as the 'holy grail' of the emerging . green economy. However, recycling that extracted carbon dioxide into fuel usable in existing engines has the potential to transform the world's environmental and economic landscape. Mr Harrison said he planned to be producing petrol on a commercial basis using renewable energy by the end of 2014. Within the next 15 years the company is aiming for a refinery-scale operation, he said. He added: 'You have the potential to change the economics of a country if you can make your own fuel.' AFS already has the backing of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. Tim Fox, the Institution's head of energy and the environment, said: 'It sounds too good to be true, but it is true.' Mr Fox said AFS's small pilot plant, which he had visited, used well-known principles with the innovation being that they have made it happen as a process. 'It uses well-known and well-established components but what is exciting is that they have put the whole thing together and shown that it can work,' he added. While the company claims to have used carbon dioxide extracted directly from the air in their reaction, it is mainly using industrial sources of the gas until it is able to improve the performance of 'carbon capture.' As yet the process is considered too expensive to be commercially viable, with the extraction of one ton of carbon dioxide costing as much as £400.","Institution of Mechanical Engineers hails the process as a potential 'game changer' in battle against climate change .

"A man suspected of strangling a young mother to death and then posting images of her dead body online before eluding authorities following a high-speed chase has turned himself in. David Kalac handed himself over to police in Wilsonville, Oregon around 9pm, NBC News reports. The 33-year-old was charged Wednesday with the second-degree murder of Amber Lynn, whose naked body was found by her son after he returned to their Port Orchard, Washington home from school on Tuesday afternoon. Scroll down for video . Gave up: Accused killer David Kalac handed himself over to police in Wilsonville, Oregon (he's pictured here after the arrest) around 9pm after an allegedly incriminating, and stomach-turning, post on 4Chan followed by a high speed chase . Wanted: David Kalac, 33,  was charged Wednesday with killing Amber Lynn, right, who was found dead inside her home on Tuesday. Her son found her body after he returned home from school . Scene: She was found murdered inside her Port Orchard, Washington home, pictured, on Tuesday afternoon - just half an hour after the killer apparently posted grisly images of her naked body online . Police previously spotted Lynn's missing gold 2001 Ford Focus in Portland in the early hours of Wednesday and saw Kalac behind the wheel, KOMO reported. They tried to pull the driver over, but he sped away and led police on a high-speed chase before he was last seen swerving into oncoming traffic. The car was last seen speeding southbound on Barbur Boulevard in Portland and passing Taylors Ferry Road. Authorities had a warrant out for his arrest for second-degree murder in the grisly killing in Kitsap County on Tuesday. On Tuesday, a 4chan user photographs just before 3pm apparently showing the woman's lifeless nude body on a bed with red marks around her neck. 'Check the news for Port Orchard Washington in a few hours,' said a 4chan message, viewed by MailOnline. 'Her son will be home from school soon. He'll find her, then call the cops. 'I just wanted to share the pics before they find me. I bought a BB gun that looks realistic enough. When they come, I'll pull it and it will be suicide by cop. 'I understand the doubts. Just check the f***ing news. I have to lose my phone now.' Friends: Police have said that the killing did not appear to be random and that the victim had been targeted . Terrifying: Images that apparently show the woman's body were posted online and show her nude on a bed inside the home with red marks around her neck. Authorities are looking into the images . In another graphic message, the poster added that 'it's way harder' to kill someone 'than it looks in the movies' and described the struggle with the woman. The woman's son returned home and found the body. He called police at 3.26pm. Time stamps on the images and posts show they were shared between 2.56pm and 3.06pm. Created in 2003 by a 15-year-old high school student from New York City, Christopher Poole, 4Chan was originally meant to be a forum to discuss Japanese anime and post photos. The image board site soon grew to by much more, and quickly became one of the biggest websites in the world. The biggest difference between 4Chan and other websites however is that it allows commenters and contributors to post anonymously, giving many free reign to do things they would not do otherwise. While this has led to the site producing some amusing and funny pranks, many are horrific and have led to the arrest of the person or persons who created them. LOLCats – The Internet obsession with cats actually began back in 2005 when one 4Chan commenter decided to post as a photo of a cat waiting for Caturday. It all took off from there. Rickroll – In 2007, a fake link to the trailer for the video game Grand Theft Auto IV was posted to the site after the website of the game’s publisher, Rockstar Games, crashed. Instead of seeing a look at the highly anticipated new game, eager fans were instead taken to the YouTube page for the Rick Astley music video “Never Gonna Give You Up.” Steve Jobs Death – In 2008 members on the site spread a false rumor that Steve Jobs was dead, causing Apple stock prices to plummet a whopping 10% in one day. Send Justin Bieber To North Korea – Justin Bieber has long been a target for the site, and in 2010 he wanted fans to tell him where they wanted him to go on his My World Tour. 4Chan users hacked his site, and the overwhelming winner was North Korea. The Canadian did not ultimately make the trip. Jessi Slaughter – In what may have been their most vicious attack to date, members of 4Chan began to cyberbully an 11-year-old girl after claiming she was having a relationship with an older man. They posted her address, called her house, and spread false rumors and reports about her and her family. The threats got so bad that the young girl was put in police protection at one point. Trayvon Martin – In 2012 a 4Chan hacker and white supremacist falsely claimed they had hacked into Trayvon Martin’s email and Facebook accounts after his murder, posting emails and photos that were supposed to back up the false claim that Martin was a drug addict and dealer. Cutting For Bieber – In early 2013, a member of 4Chan created an elaborate Twitter hoax in which they urged fans of Justin Bieber to cut themselves so the pop star would stop smoking weed. Soon, the hashtags #cutforbieber and #cuttingforbieber amassed numerous photos of fans who claimed to have slashed their wrists and forearms over Bieber's drug use. Taylor Swift's Biggest Fan – In 2013 Taylor Swift, like Bieber, wanted fans to help her out with her next contest. She was looking for her biggest fan, and 4Chan made sure the winner was a 39-year-old man named Charles who wanted to ‘sniff Taylor’s hair.’ The contest was ultimately cancelled. Celebrity Nude Leaks – Nothing 4Chan has done has had a bigger impact however than the leaking of hundreds of nude photos of celebrities in 2014, something that eventually led to the FBI getting involved. Victims included A-list stars like Jennifer Lawrence, Gabrielle Union, Kim Kardashian and Rihanna. Police are investigating the photos' connection to the case, the Kitsap Sun reported. Sheriff's Deputy Scott Wilson confirmed that the photos appeared to have been posted anonymously on the image-sharing website just before 3pm. He said officers take the photos seriously but 'we're unable to confirm whether those photographs are of this victim'. KIRO reported that, following the 'suicide by cop' claim, extra officers were stationed around the crime scene for protection. Wilson said officers don't believe the killing was random and Lynn and Kalac's Facebook pages show they are friends on the website. Have you seen this car? The woman's gold 2001 Ford Focus, like the file image above, is missing . 'It's a suspicious death and appears to be a homicide,' Wilson told the Kitsap Sun. 'This is not a random target of opportunity where somebody decided to kick in a door and kill somebody.' Neighbors told Q13Fox that the woman and her son moved to the home just a few months ago. None saw or heard anything suspicious at the house. Sheriff's officers are still trying to locate the woman's missing car, a gold 2001 Ford Focus which has two doughnut spare tires on the back wheels. The Washington license is 495-YLY. Authorities are asking anyone who sees the woman's car or knows of its location to contact the Kitsap County Sheriff's Office on 911 or 360-308-5400.

"'No need for notes': ABBA star Bjorn Ulvaeus is backing Sweden's move towards a cashless society after his son was robbed three times . Sweden was the first European country to introduce bank notes in 1661. Now it's come farther than most on the path toward getting rid of them. 'I can't see why we should be printing bank notes at all anymore,' says Bjoern Ulvaeus, former member of 1970s pop group ABBA and a vocal proponent for a world without cash. The contours of such a society are starting to take shape in this high-tech nation, frustrating those who prefer coins and bills over digital money. In most Swedish cities, public buses don't accept cash - tickets are prepaid or purchased with a cell phone text message. A small, but growing number of businesses only take cards and some bank offices — which make money on electronic transactions — have stopped handling cash altogether. 'There are towns where it isn't at all possible anymore to enter a bank and use cash,' complains Curt Persson, chairman of Sweden's National Pensioners' Organization. He says that's a problem for elderly people in rural areas who don't have credit cards or don't know how to use them to withdraw cash. The decline of cash is noticeable even in houses of worship, like the Carl Gustaf Church in Karlshamn, southern Sweden, where Vicar Johan Tyrberg recently installed a card reader to make it easier for worshippers to make offerings. 'People came up to me several times and said they didn't have cash, but would still like to donate money,' Tyrberg says. Plastic fantastic: Vicar Johan Tyrberg stands next to a credit card machine in the Carl Gustaf Church in Karlshamn, southern Sweden, to enable worshippers to donate money without having to carry cash . Bills and coins represent only three per cent of Sweden's economy, compared to an average of nine per cent in the eurozone and seven per cent in the U.S., according to the Bank for International Settlements, an umbrella organization for the world's central banks. Three per cent is still too much if you ask Ulvaeus. A cashless society may seem like an odd cause for someone who made a fortune on 'Money, Money, Money' and other ABBA hits, but for Ulvaeus it's a matter of security. After his son was robbed for the third time, he started advocating a faster transition to a fully digital economy, if only to make life harder for thieves. 'If there were no cash, what would they do?' says Ulvaeus, 66. The Swedish Bankers' Association says the shrinkage of the cash economy is already making an impact in crime statistics. End of the print run? Kronor bills and coins make up just 3 per cent of the economy . The number of bank robberies in Sweden plunged from 110 in 2008 to 16 in 2011 — the lowest level since it started keeping records 30 years ago. It says robberies of security transports are also down. The prevalence of electronic transactions — and the digital trail they generate — also helps explain why Sweden has less of a problem with graft than countries with a stronger cash culture, such as Italy or Greece, says economics professor Friedrich Schneider of the Johannes Kepler University in Austria. 'If people use more cards, they are less involved in shadow economy activities,' says Schneider, an expert on underground economies. The flip side is the risk of cybercrimes. According to the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention, the number of computerized fraud cases, including skimming, surged to nearly 20,000 in 2011 from 3,304 in 2000. It's no surprise that Sweden and other Nordic countries are at the forefront of this development, given their emphasis on technology and innovation. For the second year in a row, Sweden ranked first in the Global Information Technology Report released at the World Economic Forum in January. The Economist Intelligence Unit also put Sweden top of its latest digital economy rankings, in 2010. Both rankings measure how far countries have come in integrating information and communication technologies in their economies.","Nation was first in Europe to bring in notes in 1661 .

"He was tall with limbs of steel, definitely the strong, silent type. And when he lifted her up in his arms her heart pounded with excitement. Linda Ducharme knew her parents would never approve of her latest boyfriend - it was a 40ft tall ferris wheel after all, but then they say love knows no bounds. Mrs Ducharme first encountered the Skydiver ride, which she named Bruce, in 1982. She was instantly smitten and ran away to join the carnival just so she could be with him. Object of affection: The Ferris wheel, name Bruce, who Florida woman . Linda Ducharme married last year  after a 30 year romance . Intimate: Mrs Ducharme with Bruce, the ferris wheel she fell in love with in 1982 before rescuing from a scrapyard and marrying . Their relationship has certainly had it's ups and downs. Mrs Ducharme, 55, who has also fallen in love with a airplane and a train, lost contact with Bruce in 1986 before tracking him down to a Kansas scrapyard years later and nursing him back to health. The couple were married by a non-denominational preacher last year in Florida -  a state which prohibits same sex marriage - and this year they renewed their vows. Mrs Ducharme, who kept her maiden name, is one of a small number of people who consider objects lovers, a condition known as objectum sexuality. She recalls how the first time she got on the ride, she was left breathless. Young love: Mrs Ducharme with Bruce the ferris wheel, some time in the . early 1980s before he was damaged in a storm and put out of action . I do: Mrs Ducharme hold her hand to Bruce as they are married by a non-denominational Preacher in Florida - a state which prohibits same sex marriages . She told the New York Daily News: 'I got this weird feeling I can’t explain. 'My heart was pounding as we went up the platform and got on the ride. I felt like I was being taken by this ride. In recent years a number of people suffering with objectum sexuality have hit the headlines with their own unusual relationships. Erika Eiffel married Paris's Eiffel Tower in 2007 while Eija-Riitta Eklöf Berliner-Mauer is believed to be the first person to go public with the condition, when she announced her love for a Swedish red fence. It is thought Berliner-Mauer was first person with objectum sexuality to marry the object of their desire, getting hitched to the Berlin Wall in 1979, unofficially adding Berliner-Mauer to her surname. Eva K from the Netherlands falls in love with words and phrases – as well as a hydraulic flood barrier and a floating crane in the past. 'My goal is to spend the rest of my life and grow old with him.' Mrs Ducharme's previous relationship with a train had ended when she was caught locked in an intimate embrace with it and fired from her job as a conductor. Speaking on Logo TV's What!?: Animism show she recalled: 'I was seen in a romantic embrace with a train and subsequently, I was fired.' Mrs Ducharme said her parents were strobngly against her relationships. 'My mother’s reaction was completely off the wall; she was a very religious person,' Ducharme explained. 'To her, I was an abomination to God and she wanted to change that … she really thought I was demon possessed.' Tragedy struck in 1986 when Bruce was damaged by a storm and sent to Kansas for repairs. The couple lost contact and Mrs Ducharme spiralled into depression. 'I was completely alone,' she said. 'I felt that I was dying from the inside. I was very, very lonely.' But 25 years later a friend tracked Bruce down to a scrap yard on the other side of the country 3,000 miles away. Mrs Ducharme, who kept her maiden name, is one of a small number of people who consider objects lovers, a condition known as objectum sexuality . Mrs Ducharme immediately set off to track down her lost love. She recalled: 'I was carrying pizza to him — Bruce smells pizza and there’s the love of his life returning to him. 'It felt like I never left him.' Bruce has now been restored and Mrs Ducharme hopes to get him operational again soon. At their renewal ceremony in Florida last year, small group of friends gathered round as the preacher said: 'I tie you, flesh to steel.' Mrs Ducharme added: ''My goal is to spend the rest of my life and grow old with him and eventually get a piece of land where we can just be all by ourselves.'","Linda Ducharme, 55, has a condition known as objectum sexuality .

"A bright, articulate A-level student jumped to her death after battling an anxiety disorder which her mother fears was triggered by years of bullying. An inquest heard Lauren Johnson, who wanted to be a clinical psychologist or a vet, masked her symptoms for three years before taking her own life in June in Accrington, Lancashire. Her mother Dawn said her daughter was 'systematically and horrendously abused' by bullies since the age of 14, but bottled up the devastating emotional consequences. Tragedy: Lauren Johnson, 17, battled an anxiety disorder for three years before taking her own life . Speaking after the inquest Lauren's mother, who has worked as a mental health nurse for 20 years, said: 'The bullying was a significant factor in Lauren's mental illness - prior to that she had a normal childhood normal upbringing. 'The experts said she was systematically and horrendously abused by bullying but she internalised it. In my view, without the bullying she would not have developed mental health issues and she would not have died. 'The therapist said the bullying was systematic but we could never get to the bottom of it. There was no report from school because they didn't know anything about her troubles because she just absorbed it and took it on the chin rather fire back at anyone. 'She maybe took that torment on herself until the point came when she became really unwell with it. The bullying had stopped by that time but the damage was already done. We tried to talk to her about what happened but it was too painful for her.' The inquest yesterday heard Lauren, from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, began displaying mental health issues in 2011 which were first put down to 'social anxiety'. Bright: The teenager wanted to go to university and dreamed of being a psychologist or vet . She was later diagnosed with a psychosis-like personality disorder, and eventually told her mother Dawn about her bullying ordeal. Doctors prescribed medication but the teenager 'didn't want to be reminded that she was unwell', the inquest heard, and developed insecurities about being admitted to a psychiatric unit. She self-harmed, including on one occasion in a public toilet, and police were called out when she was found standing near railway bridges and viaducts. Last June Lauren was due to be interviewed as a volunteer on the mental health and children's wards at Burnley General Hospital ahead of applying to university. Her mother's final words to her were to wish her good luck. But instead of attending the hospital, she walked to a car park in nearby Accrington. PC Graham Walsh spent half an hour trying to talk Lauren down, but she jumped from a ledge. He said: 'She wouldn't let me come to her. It was impossible to try and grab her.' The teenager, who was studying maths, chemistry, biology and psychology A-levels at Bacup and Rawtenstall Grammar School, suffered fatal head injuries and was pronounced dead at Royal Blackburn Hospital. A suicide note was found on her laptop. The inquest heard Lauren had been seen by several psychologists and had been to hospital many times. Dr Adam Joiner said he saw Lauren six days before she died, adding: 'She was wearing make up and fashionable clothing, and seemed happy. 'She seemed interested in the reform of her diagnosis and we discussed how treatment and recovery were possible. 'She explained she did not enjoy her recent hospital admission in an adult ward and her intention to avoid further admissions.' But Lauren's mental health worker Carla Nightingale said: 'Lauren had the intelligence to be able to work out what people wanted her to say and project that image.' Lauren's mother told the inquest: 'I always had a gut feeling that one day she wouldn't be with us. 'I've waited for that phonecall or knock on the door. I kind of saw it that if she did not get the help she needed, one day that would be inevitable. Coroner Michael Singleton told the inquest at Accrington Town Hall (pictured): 'Lauren was a very intelligent and clearly articulate young lady, a young lady who had a personality disorder' 'It is very difficult to cure a mental health problem and Lauren kept a lot to herself and tried to manage it very much herself. Because she tried to manage it herself, she ended up in crisis a lot of time when she wanted to kill herself. Sometimes she lacked insight into how low her mood was.' 'Lauren was good at masking things and would try and mask her symptoms so people would think she was okay. I did air my concerns and said I found it hard to judge that risk. 'It was really inconsistent. Her behaviour had become erratic. She would try and mask it and put make-up on and present as very cheery.' Lauren's death has already prompted the launch of a charity in her memory, Lauren's Place, to help young people with mental health issues. It also prompted a petition and protest march supported by thousands calling for action to make the site where Lauren died 'safe or knock it down'. Coroner Michael Singleton told the inquest at Accrington Town Hall: 'Lauren was a very intelligent and clearly articulate young lady, a young lady who had a personality disorder which seemed to have various diagnosis at various times. 'Clearly Lauren's mother, working in mental health had some insight into problems and appropriate help was sought at an early stage. 'It seems to me that the nature of Lauren's mental health and her intelligence and insight into it always meant it was always going to be a very difficult situation to manage.' He recorded a verdict of suicide.

"A senior Scientologist has condemned the controversial religion's leader for turning the organisation into an autocratic, heavy-handed fundraising machine. Debbie Cook, one of the most respected members within the Church, sent a shock email denouncing chairman David Miscavige to 12,000 Scientologists just minutes after midnight on New Year's Day. She accuses him of turning the Church, which numbers celebrity followers including Tom Cruise and John Travolta, into a tyrannical regime in direct conflict with the doctrine laid down by founder L Ron Hubbard in the 1950s.

"Azrum Begum, 54, from Bradford, West Yorks, was admitted to Bradford Royal Infirmary for routine gall bladder surgery, but later died from multiple organ failure after a series of errors in the operation . A mother who died due to a series of errors following a routine operation was told by nurses to 'stop being a baby and grow up', an inquest heard. Azrum Begum, 54, from Bradford, West Yorks, died in 'astronomical pain' after a routine operation turned into a disaster when surgeons left holes in her stomach, the hearing heard. Her grieving family said she was told by nurses to 'stop being a baby and grow up' before dying in hospital of multi-organ failure two days after gall bladder surgery. They added that staff, annoyed by Mrs Begum's cries of pain, refused to give her more medication and switched off her bedside bell to reach medical staff. The mother of three had two holes in her stomach muscle caused by a pen-like instrument used in surgery at Bradford Royal Infirmary. Ms Begum's son Mohammed Faraz told the inquest: 'She was in astronomical pain. 'Because of her rheumatoid arthritis she has a high pain threshold but she was behaving like a child.' It was not until the morning after the operation that nurses alerted staff and an urgent CT scan was ordered, the hearing heard. Communication breakdowns meant Mrs Begum's surgical team were not informed the mother was being kept in hospital because of pain, meaning she did not get a post-operative review after surgery. Meanwhile, Mrs Begum's urgent scan was delayed by hours after a porter couldn't find her after she was moved to another ward. Coroner Dominic Bell said there had been a catalogue of deficiencies in care given to Mrs Begum in her last hours. Surgeons repaired the holes in her stomach, which the coroner concluded were most likely caused by surgical instruments in her previous operation. Bradford Teaching Hospital Trust's interim director Dr Robin Jeffrey expressed deep regrets for the way Mrs Begum was treated at Bradford Royal Infirmary. He said: 'I'd like to express our sincere regrets to the family for how this has turned out.' Bradford Teaching Hospital Trust's director Dr Robin Jeffrey said the Trust had learnt a number of lessons and made changes since Mrs Begum's death - such as better checks on patients recovering from surgery . Dr Jeffrey said the Trust had learnt a number of lessons and made changes since Mrs Begum's death in November 2012 from multi-organ failure. Changes included supervising trainees, more observations and better checks on patients recovering from surgery. Recording a narrative verdict, Dr Bell said there had been a number of deficiencies in care but added he was satisfied with investigations since carried out by the NHS Trust. He said: 'I'm also satisfied that the deficiencies in care were identified and that they have been appropriately addressed with remedial action. 'I see no requirement on my part to take any further action.' Following the inquest, Mr Faraz said: 'We feel we have got more information about lessons learned and changes made than the Trust made us privy to before. 'We are happy about that and that the Trust has said it will meet us again.' Speaking today, Mrs Begum's eldest son, Mohammed Ayaz, said: 'It was like the Nurses were calling my mum a wimp. 'One nurse even said to her, 'Come on now, I've had this operation and it wasn't so bad'. 'My mum had a high pain threshold because she has suffered with arthritis for the past 30 years, she has had operations in the past. 'She said to me that she has had operations before and has not known pain like this, but the nurses assured me it was normal and so I said to my mum that it was normal. 'But I was wrong, and the medical professionals were wrong. 'My mum was going in for a routine operation and she ends up coming out dead. 'Mum just wanted the operation over with, she was looking forward to going on holiday visiting her mum in Pakistan, she should not have died.'","Azrum Begum, 54, went to Bradford Royal Infirmary for a routine operation .
