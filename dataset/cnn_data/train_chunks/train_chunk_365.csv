"Gleneagles, Scotland (CNN) -- If you're a U.S. golf fan, or Tom Watson, look away now. After a heavy defeat to Europe in the Ryder Cup, it's time for soul searching and reflection.

"(CNN) -- Mark Ronson is one of the best connected men in the music industry. The 34-year-old producer and DJ has collaborated with some of the biggest names in music, producing Amy Winehouse's 2006 ""Back to Black"" album, reworking songs from seminal British bands The Smiths and Radiohead and working with Kanye West and Duran Duran among other musical luminaries. Coming from a wealthy family in Manhattan, Ronson grew up with music and celebrity at the kitchen table before making his name as a DJ on the New York club scene in the early 1990s. Moving our from behind the decks Ronson took to producing other artists and has picked up awards for his work in the studio including a Grammy for Best Producer in 2008. A rare thing for a producer, he's almost as well known as some of the big name musicians he works with, but Ronson's latest project sees him taking the stage with his new band The Business Intl. For Ronson it's not such a radical departure from his previous work or how he sees himself. ""I think we live in an era certainly where it's not unusual to be many things, especially in music,"" he told CNN. ""Now I'm in a slightly more unique position of actually being an artist in the front of my own record and putting them out as well producing them, but it seems to all fit."" Described by his childhood friend Sean Lennon as ""very driven... you wouldn't think he's so ambitious from meeting him because he's so relaxed,"" Ronson is taking his varied career and lifestyle in his stride. CNN talked to him about his musical identity and being the man with the golden Rolodex. CNN: Do you think of yourself as the master of collaborations? Mark Ronson: I just think that because my own albums are more collaborative affairs...I've got this tag of master collaborator, but I don't think it's necessarily true. If this was a report card from school, it would say ""Plays well with others."" That's one of the things that helps and more importantly I grew up liking such a wide range of music that I love working in different genres. Not being stuck in one genre definitely widens the palette of the kind of people you can work with. CNN: Are you affected by fame? MR: I'm sort of lucky to live in New York where I live a pretty anonymous lifestyle anyway. I'm a bit more aware of it when I come [to London] and sometimes I think I'm almost naive to think it doesn't exist. I'd still like to think that I could just live the same life I did 3 years ago, going on the Tube, or going to see a band and walking around the front to watch and realizing that I'll probably just have to stand here and take pictures with people's camera phones, which is fun. I'm not mobbed, nobody really cares that much about my life and I just get to live it how I would otherwise. CNN: Do you see yourself as responsible for making Amy Winehouse a star? MR: I definitely didn't make Amy a star. I helped her find a great sound that really fitted well with what she wanted to do. In her songs there's a lot of heartache and remorse and regret and fire that was in a lot of music, jazz and soul of the '50s and '60s. And it was also that we gave it a modern twist... I added drums from hip-hop; I wanted to make a modern soul record that if RZA from Wu Tang heard he would've wanted to sample it. So if anything, I think Amy is more responsible for me being where I am than maybe the other way around. Watch Mark Ronson talking about Amy Winehouse's ""Rehab"" CNN: Are you a pragmatist or a pessimist? MR: I'm a pragmatist. The first record I produced was for this artist Nikka Costa. It was on MTV, there was this hype about it and everyone thought it was going to be this big thing and it came out and it really didn't do anything. And I thought that was a really good lesson in a way because it lets you know that no matter how many people come out telling you it's going to be great, it could easily come out and do nothing. CNN: You're thought of as the man with the golden Rolodex. Is that true? MR: The only people I know really that are bold faced names who are considered ""celebs"" are musicians. It's not likely you open up my phone and see Kiera Knightly and Jude Law. These are just musicians that I work with and a few of them happen to be famous, so people go, ""Oh, your famous friends!"" They aren't really, they are just co-workers anyway. CNN: Were contacts the key to your early success? MR: It's just not even worth arguing with that because it's so far away from the truth. I can't run around refuting the fact that I came from a comfortable upbringing. But the fact that I had any help and connections getting into what I did is well, it's just not true. One of my favorite ""old skool"" hip-hop records is ""I Know You Got Soul"" by Eric B. and Rakim, and it's got a classic line, ""It's not where you're from, it's where you're at"" which always applies in hip-hop. I was just a good DJ who got better because of an enthusiasm for music and playing out. Once people became aware of me outside that more insular hip-hop scene they were kind of like ""Oh, how did he get here? Must be because of his parents."" And they have to find something to say and that was one of the criticisms they chose.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- ""Never wear your makeup to bed,"" implore the beauty editors. But Dolly Parton was never one for following conventional advice on looking good. Dolly Parton has no plans to step out of the spotlight: "" I hope to just fall over one day in the middle of a song."" She sets her own standards, from her striking sculptured hair to the bright lashings of eye shadow caked on a face that she has admitted in the past owes a lot to modern surgery. ""I know I'm a bit over-exaggerated; I wear too much makeup, too much hair,"" the singer-songwriter and theme park co-owner told CNN's Revealed. And it's not just for the stage or public appearances. The truth, Dolly told CNN, is that when she's in California or New York ""where anything could happen"" she goes to bed with her makeup on. ""I think I'm not going to wash my face until morning, and then I'll clean it off and I'll put it on in case I have to get up in the middle of the night,"" she said. ""If I go out in public, people expect me to look a certain way and if you say 'There's Dolly' or whoever it may be, you expect to see them in the way that you see them, the way you know them.""  Watch Dolly Parton on a photo shoot for a magazine cover » . Dolly's dedication to her image has helped push the small town country girl up the ranks from gifted singer and songwriter to international icon complete with her own Dolly-branded theme park. Parton introduced herself to the country music charts in 1967, at the age of 21, with her debut album ""Hello, I'm Dolly."" A successful partnership with Porter Wagoner, the host of the television show of the same name, put her on the national stage. Forty albums have followed, including a succession of No. 1 hits, awards and high-profile performances on television and film. ""She is so full of life and spirit and she loves playing jokes on people and she likes to keep you on your toes, but musically I have never met anyone who can walk out on stage and consistently sing as in tune and proper and right as Dolly Parton does,"" her sometime duet partner Kenny Rogers told CNN. She recently wrote the score for ""9 to 5: The Musical,"" a stage version of the 1980 comedy ""Nine to Five,"" a film she not only starred in but for which she also composed the award-winning title song. The musical was nominated for four Tony Awards this year, but failed to win any. After a disappointing four-month run, the curtains are set to close on September 6. Perennially upbeat, Parton later said she ""couldn't have asked for a better experience on my first Broadway show."" In 1986, Parton's megastar status was confirmed with the opening of her own theme park ""Dollywood."" In 2001, a water park, ""Dollywood's Splash Country,"" opened next door. Both are in Pigeon Forge, a small town at the foothills of Tennessee's Great Smoky Mountains National Park where Parton famously grew up as one of 12 children crammed into a three-room cabin. Dolly is without doubt the town's most successful daughter. Every year, for the past 24 years, locals have lined the streets to wave and cheer as Parton rides atop the leading float in the Dolly Parton Annual Parade of Pigeon Forge. This year was no different. Her float was transformed into a snowy scene, complete with fir trees and a log cabin from which she waved at well-wishers, many wearing T-shirts emblazoned with her photo.  See photos of the 2009 Dolly Parade » . One man even had her image etched onto his back in a large tattoo. ""It's just the magic she brings you and that heart-warming feeling. The music just blows you away, blows my mind away, I just love it,"" he told CNN. The locals' love of Dolly is hardly surprising. She's a one-woman PR machine for Pigeon Forge, and through ""Dollywood"" is Sevier County's biggest employer. You don't want to upset your boss. Many members of the extended Parton family are on the payroll at ""Dollywood,"" and entertain the park's 2.5 million visitors when the main attraction can't be there. One of them is Bill Owens, her uncle, who is credited with taking the young Dolly Parton out of the Great Smoky Mountains and into the big smoke. ""I took Dolly to Nashville when she was very young,"" Owens told CNN. ""I've worked with her since she was 10 years old, when I heard her singing. We'd take the wagon back and forth to the radio stations and the minute she graduated we was (sic) gone the same day to Nashville."" It would be easy to say she never looked back, but that isn't true; she's always looking back. ""I always thought when I was young, if I ever made it -- and I hoped I would, and dreamed that I would -- I thought I would love to be able to come home and do something special to honor my family,"" she said. ""You always want your people to be proud of what you have accomplished."" Parton told CNN she's accomplished everything that she set out to do, and she has no plans to ever step out of the spotlight. ""I don't want to retire, I hope to just fall over one day in the middle of a song and that's how I want to go -- with a smile on my face hopefully.""

"(CNN) -- It is always with a sense of great anticipation that I get ready for the thrilling spectacle that is golf's Ryder Cup. To see it come ""home,"" not only to Scotland, where the game was first played, but to Gleneagles in particular, where the first ""international"" match was played between the best professionals of Great Britain and their U.S. counterparts 90 odd years ago, makes it all the more significant. It has the makings of a battle royal. Let's hope it becomes one. We want this one going down to the wire, with memorable golfing moments, good gladiatorial combat and most of all, exemplary sportsmanship. A whiff of sulfur never goes astray in sporting combat, but let's hope it doesn't get out of hand. Nine Ryder Cups have been played since Tom Watson last captained America to victory at the Belfry in 1993, and Team Europe has won seven of them. Given Europe's strong record over the last two decades, the burning question is how will Team USA perform under the captaincy of the great Watson? Before a competitive ball is struck, this is already becoming a battle of pure passion versus arch professionalism. The American setup is businesslike and has always has been. They do things by the book, dotting every ""i,"" crossing every ""t"" and clinically going about their business with ruthless efficiency. Ryder Cup veteran Jim Furyk embodies this very style. Like the winter sun, he's brilliant but cold. The Europeans, on the other hand, play with a heart and passion that is very difficult to define. Every other year, they unite like a band of brothers. It's a bonding exercise. Personal egos go out the window, while unity and a musketeer's ""all for one, one for all"" mentality embodies the team dynamic. It's visceral. Think of Seve Ballesteros and Nick Faldo -- usually arch rivals on the course -- hugging and crying in each other's arms at Oak Hill in 1995 and you'll know what I mean. Hard to explain, but it is there and it's the fuel for the engine that is European team golf. This year's captain Paul McGinley personifies that team dynamic. Never the greatest player, he was an achiever nonetheless and never afraid to dream big. Hewn from the heft and brawn of Gaelic football back in his native Ireland, McGinley is a team player through and through. From his earliest representative days as a golfing talent, his greatest experiences have been as part of a collective, playing for Leinster, and Ireland, and making the Walker Cup amateur side in 1991. Winning the World Cup for Ireland in 1997 alongside Padraig Harrington exemplified that shared experience perfectly. Since becoming a Ryder Cup hero in his debut in 2002, the Dubliner has not been part of a losing team, either as a player or vice-captain. But can he handle the ""favorites"" tag? It's going to be fascinating to see what the team will deliver for him. Conversely, Watson is a bona fide legend of the game who is also a teak-tough, battle-hardened competitor. At 65, he still has the power to stop the game's elites in their tracks when he starts hitting balls on any range. He is the most successful British Open champion of the modern era in golf and one of the greatest match-players of all time. He clearly loves the Ryder Cup and absolutely hates the way the matches have gone against Team USA over the last 19 years. Like any great gladiator, the losses annoy him beyond belief, hence his absolute desire to win this one back. The question is, however, whether he can fire up these boys in red, white and blue. Some of the team are young enough to be their captain's grandsons -- will it be ""my way or the highway?"" Can he go deep with his team in terms of connection or will it be tough love from the elder statesman? This truly is a fascinating prospect, with so much at stake. In the end, it may only be a game. But in truth, it is in actual fact, much more important than that altogether. ""Olé"" or ""USA""? Let the games begin!","Ryder Cup begins at Gleneagles in Scotland on Friday .

"(CNN) -- The week started with all focus on golf's latest child prodigy, but it has ended with a former wonder kid finally fulfilling her great promise. Michelle Wie claimed her first major title Sunday, winning the U.S. Women's Open at her 11th attempt. Now 24, she triumphed by two shots from fellow American, Stacy Lewis, holding her nerve as the world No. 1 made a final-round charge. ""Oh my God, I can't believe this is happening,"" an ecstatic Wie was quoted as saying by the PGA website in the aftermath of her victory. ""Obviously, there are moments of doubt in there,"" she continued, referring to the prospect that she might never win a major.""(But) I had so many people surrounding me. They never lost faith in me. That's pushed me forward."" This mental fortitude was on display as Wie overcame a double-bogey at the 16th hole, bouncing back with a birdie at the next and closing with a par to sign for a level 70. Lewis also dropped a shot at 16, but finished with two birdies to card a four-under-par 66 that left her level for the tournament. She finished one ahead of Northern Ireland's 22-year-old Stephanie Meadow, who birdied her last hole to take third place in her professional debut ahead of South Korea's Amy Yang. Most of the talk at the start of the tournament, which was played at Pinehurst -- also host of the men's equivalent the previous week -- was on 11-year-old Lucy Li. The American was the youngest qualifier to start the event, but missed the halfway cut after carding two rounds of 78, though she impressed many with her mature attitude. Wie first competed in an LPGA event when she was 12, then turned pro when she was 15 and also played in several men's tournaments while still a teenager. At age 16, she made the cut at the 2006 SK Telecom Open men's event in South Korea, reportedly receiving a higher appearance fee than the winner took home. Before this week, she had won four titles on the LPGA Tour -- but her best result in a major was runner-up at the Kraft Nabisco Championship earlier this season, and as an amateur at the 2005 LPGA Championship. Red hot Streelman wins Travelers . On the men's PGA Tour, Kevin Streelman birdied his last seven holes in a row to overtake Sergio Garcia, K.J. Choi, and Aaron Baddeley and claim a sensational Travelers Championship victory at TPC River Highlands Sunday. The 35-year-old was way off the pace as he headed on to the back nine but made birdie on the 411-yard par-four 12th to signify the beginning of a red hot charge that would see him claim the outright lead on 15-under-par at the last. Streelman had to wait for Choi and Garcia to finish their rounds but the chasing pair couldn't make birdie at the 18th sealing a remarkable triumph for the American. The win marks first time a player has ever birdied the last seven holes of a tournament to win a title on the PGA Tour. ""(It was) just one of those days where I felt I couldn't miss,"" a delighted Streelman told CBS after reaching the club house. Choi and Garcia finished joint second on 14-under-par while Baddeley ended the day a shot further back in fourth at 13-under-par. America's Brendan Steele and Ryan Moore tied for fifth at 12-under-par. Ilonen holds on in Cork . Finland's Miko Ilonen held off Italy's Edoardo Molinari to win the Irish Open at Fota Island in Cork by a single shot. Ilonen had led the tournament from the opening day but suffered a late scare on the par-five last after driving a wayward tee-shot into the trees. The 34-year-old composed himself, however, and closed out with a bogie to finish at 13-under-par and win by the slimmest of margins. Sweden's Kristoffer Broberg and English duo Matthew Baldwin and Danny Willett finished the day tied for third on 11-under-par behind second placed Molinari on 12-under. Home favorite Graeme McDowell, meanwhile, failed to secure a much desired first win on Irish soil as a poor putting display ensured he ended the tournament in sixth position at 10-under-par.","Michelle Wie wins the first major title of her career at U.S. Women's Open .

"(CNN) -- With her sumptuous voice and glamorous looks, Russian opera star Anna Netrebko is one of the most popular ambassadors of classical music today. Discovered by maestro Valery Gergiev when she was aged 22, cleaning the floors of the Mariinsky Theatre in St Petersburg, Netrebko has grown to become one of the world's greatest living sopranos. Since the Cinderella-like beginning of her career, the Russian diva has charmed audiences at major opera houses across the world, including New York's Metropolitan Opera, Milan's Scala and London's Royal Opera House. Along the way, Netrebko's charm has helped her build a celebrity status rivaling that of a pop star. The 39-year-old soprano has her own music videos and is a global ambassador for luxury jeweler Chopard, while Playboy magazine has placed her in its ""sexiest babes of classical music"" list. Netrebko opened up to CNN's Revealed about her first steps, her bubbly personality and how motherhood could transform her career. CNN: How did it all begin, what was your first job in an opera house? Anna Netrebko: Don't ask me to tell you about cleaning the floors -- it wasn't really a job. We were young, we wanted to spend a lot of time in the theater. It was very easy for us to watch performances -- opera, ballet, concerts -- we didn't have to pay for any of that. Working there as a cleaning lady was very convenient. I worked for two years when I was in my first years of studying. That was enough. CNN: Magazines like Playboy said you were sexy -- what did that say about the stereotypes of opera and how your image challenged them? AN: This is very hard to say -- I would say if you cannot really sing, they will not take you seriously. They might bring you up to Mount Olympus for a few days but after that, if you're nothing you'll fall down. Your good looks and craziness will not help you in this particular profession because this profession is very serious. There were a lot of people who said I didn't have a voice and I didn't have talent -- it's just a flash around me. But you know what? I took it in one ear and threw out of another one. How can you prove what you really are? You have to work -- that's what I did. I continued doing my photo shoots but I've always been very serious -- all my colleagues will tell you that. CNN: How does your image help make opera more popular, more accessible? AN: I don't know if I'm helping to bring classical music to a wider audience -- maybe, I don't know. But still, the audience has to learn to love classical music, not the image but the music itself; this is what's important. CNN: You have a bubbly personality. Do you think that opera people feel you have to have a strict personality? AN: No! I am who I am but of course there are responsibilities. I have to be careful -- I cannot party all night and then be destroyed for a few days because I practically don't have a few days to rest. There's very little time to get yourself together. CNN: Why do you think you get picked to play these young roles? AN: In opera, it's everything about the voice and possibility. I have a lyric soprano [voice] so I can sing certain roles and usually they are the young girls. If I had a dramatic soprano [voice] I would sing Tosca -- all these serious dramatic heroines. CNN: When do you think you'll make the transition to older roles and how do you feel about it? AN: Oh, I have to, soon.  It's natural. My voice is changing and I also want to try something new. I don't know what happened to me, but I think after the baby my voice suddenly became big. Sometimes I'm reading critics saying the voice is too big, she has to do more dramatic repertoire. Maybe this is what I'm trying to do, slowly, because if you move too fast you can destroy your voice. It's happened many times with lots of singers so I have to be careful. CNN: Does the pressure ease off when you become a star? AN: No, the pressure of being good at a performance will never go away. Because to go on Mount Olympus is one way, and fast, but to stay there is very hard. It's just a few years really, a few golden years of your career you can really stand at a very high level.

"(CNN) -- Tom Watson has learned plenty in the 21 years since he was last captain of the United States' Ryder Cup golf team. But there is one new-fangled invention the eight-time major winner can't quite get his head around. Watson does in fact have his own Twitter account with almost 59,000 followers, but he's a social media novice compared to the likes of current Ryder stars Bubba Watson and Ian Poulter -- posting just over 100 times in 21 months. ""I've learned that it's very difficult to tweet,"" the 65-year-old told CNN's Living Golf show ahead of the biennial tussle between Europe and the U.S. at Gleneagles in Scotland this week. ""I can't get my fingers to do it fast enough or put the right hashtag -- it's hard to do stuff like that."" It will also be a tall order to wrest the Ryder Cup from European grasp -- the subject of his first official tweet back in January 2013. Whereas once golf's most enduring team contest was a virtual American whitewash, now it is their continental cousins who rule supreme. The U.S. has won just one Ryder Cup since 1999, and last time out in 2012 suffered a humbling that became known as the ""Miracle of Medinah"" when Europe somehow overturned a 10-6 deficit on an exhilarating final day. What better skipper to have at the helm, then, than Watson, who won three and drew one of his four appearances as a player, and was the last man to mastermind a U.S. triumph on European soil back in 1993? With a new-look team containing three rookies, the five-time British Open winner is the ideal man to school his newbies in the process of handling unprecedented levels of pressure. ""Being a captain, I'm a stage manager,"" Watson says of his role as captain. ""I try to provide everything the players need -- from the physical part but also the mental part. The mental part is important, to keep the players positive. ""Make them understand that I understand what they are going through. Be a go-to guy if they have something they need to talk about under the high pressure situation of a Ryder Cup. ""It's the highest pressure, I think, in all of golf. There are situations where you may get above your pressure level and since I've been there before I can be a go-to guy to talk to the players about that."" The task facing Watson is clear -- just take a glance at golf's rankings. Three of the top five players in the world are in the European ranks -- the only American is veteran Jim Furyk at No. 4 -- and the continent has four straight Ryder Cup victories to its name on home turf. No doubt Watson will be reminding his players of the last time he donned the captain's robes, when he led the U.S. to a 15-13 victory over Europe at the Belfry in Birmingham over two decades ago. ""We go into the Ryder Cup and on paper the Europeans look better without question,"" Watson says. ""The McIlroys, the Kaymers, the Stensons, the Roses, are players who've really played well throughout the summer. ""Right now on paper we are underdogs, but things can change. We all go through good stretches and we all go through bad stretches. ""The thing that we bring to it is an underlying American spirit that we get the job done, no matter what it takes. That's the attitude that I have and the attitude I'll project to the players."" The European charge will be spearheaded by the hottest player on the planet at present -- Rory McIlroy. The Northern Irishman captured half of the majors on offer in 2014 -- adding a second U.S. PGA Championship to a maiden British Open title -- to take his career tally to four. The 24-year-old is fully aware that as Europe's leading star he is going to be targeted by those in stars and stripes, the logic being that if you take down a team's top talent, the rest will crumble. After his U.S. PGA victory at Valhalla -- scene of the USA's last Ryder Cup win in 2008 -- McIlroy said he was ready to be the European ""talisman"" and drive his side forward. Watson is a big admirer of the undisputed world No. 1. ""One of the things I love about Rory is how he plays the game,"" Watson said. ""He plays it a lot like I do. He plays it quickly, with the blinders on. You don't see him moan with a bad shot, you don't see him go bananas with a good shot. ""He keeps it on a steady keel throughout and I like that about him. I like his manners and the way he treats people, the way he respects the game and the people around him. ""He's great for the game of golf and he's a very formidable competitor. I don't wish him too well in a Ryder Cup, I can say that, but I wish him well in other events."" One of the biggest questions the United States team will face is whether they will suffer any kind of hangover from that chastening experience at Medinah in 2012. Under the leadership of Davis Love III, the U.S. had assumed a seemingly unassailable lead ahead of Sunday's singles matches, storming into a four-point advantage. It could have been even better, but for Englishman Poulter, who compiled an astonishing run of five birdies in his last five holes to rescue a point for Europe in Saturday's final fourballs match. Captain Jose Maria Olazabal's decision to front-load his singles lineup on Sunday then paid instant dividends as Europe won the first five matches, including Justin Rose's pivotal late victory over American stalwart Phil Mickelson. ""I watched (2012) with glee the first two days then with a huge whole in my stomach after we lost on that Sunday,"" Watson recalls. ""It lasted for several days that week -- it was physical. It was a very disappointing loss. ""But I have to give credit to the European team, they were 25 under par collectively on Sunday; we were eight under par. ""But it still boiled down, even to a five-point lead, to one stroke of the putter by Justin Rose on 17 which basically turned the match around."" With Tiger Woods missing through injury, Mickelson will be one of the lynchpins of Watson's 2014 team. The 44-year-old has featured in the last eight Ryder Cups, stretching back to 1995, and brings with him an invaluable wealth of experience. And while his golfing prowess is the major weapon in Mickelson's armory, his sharp wit gets the team going. ""One of the things I've done is talk to pretty much all the Ryder Cup captains of the past and they've all said Phil is really good in the team room, getting people jazzed up, pumped up,"" Watson says. ""As a captain, I want the team room to be jokes going back and forth -- that helps with the nerves and Phil really does help that way. ""One of the great things about Phil, he loves to gamble so when he's playing golf there's always something on the line. ""You want somebody like that not only play for your team but also talk to the other players. Phil has that gambler mentality -- he can do anything he wants to do on the golf course, and Phil does."" After two defeats in a row, and five reverses out of the last six, some have questioned whether the U.S. team has the desire to wrestle the Ryder Cup back across the Atlantic. But Watson has no such concerns. ""There's no issues about motivation -- they are all motivated to win the cup back,"" he says. ""We're tired of getting beat, and very simply they look at 2012 when the Europeans made that great run and came from behind as something they want to make amends for. ""They want to prove to the world they can play.""","Veteran Tom Watson is the United States' 2014 Ryder Cup captain .

Pictured stepping off the plane as the U.S. team arrived at Edinburgh airport ahead of this week's match, the world No. 10 sported a new haircut with ""USA"" shaved into the side of his head. Although it might be unusual for a golfer to have such an outrageous hairstyle, displays of national pride are entirely in keeping with the Ryder Cup. Played every two years, it pits the best golfers from Europe and the USA against each other with the winner securing bragging rights in the sport's most partisan contest. Europe has dominated the competition in recent years, winning the last two contests. The U.S. team, captained by eight-time major winner Tom Watson, will be out for revenge when the 2014 competition begins at Scotland's Gleneagles course on Friday. While golf courses are usually the epitome of peace and quiet, the Ryder Cup galleries are altogether more raucous. So expect star spangled banners and roars of ""USA, USA"" to accompany Fowler around the course throughout the three days of competition. With so much adrenaline and excitement in the air, tensions have boiled over in the past. During the 1999 event at the Brookline club in Massachusetts, the USA team was criticized for celebrating a dramatic victory on the green while European player Jose Maria Olazabal was still waiting to take his putt. Expect more fierce clashes over the course of this week...","Rickie Fowler unveils a patriotic haircut ahead of this week's Ryder Cup .

"(CNN) -- Renee Mosier was one of an estimated half-million patients in the United States who were unable to get the drugs they needed because of shortages. ""You feel like you're in a fight with one hand tied behind your back,"" said Mosier, 56. It was a fight she lost in June. According to the Food and Drug Administration, the number of drug shortages has increased nearly 300% since 2005. More than half of the drugs on the shortage list are considered critical -- meaning they have no alternative. The drugs most often in short supply include anesthetics and oncological drugs. Mosier was diagnosed in 2006 with ovarian cancer, the fifth-deadliest cancer for women, according to the American Cancer Society. Surgery and treatment were able to keep her tumors at bay until 2009, when she returned to surgery. She was back in remission until June 2011, when her cancer appeared once again. Mosier was able to get her required surgery, but her doctor, Dr. Wendel Naumann, was unable to get Doxil, the chemotherapy treatment she needed. 'A huge, growing crisis in this country' ""This is a huge, growing crisis in this country, where we're actually having to ration drugs,"" said Naumann, who calls it ""unbelievable."" In November 2011, Mosier appeared on CNN's ""Sanjay Gupta, MD"" to share her ordeal. She told Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, that without Doxil, she had few alternatives. ""At the time we just said, 'Let's go with what we have, and see what happens,' and the cancer pretty rapidly recurred."" Mosier was never able to get another dose of Doxil and spent the last month of her life in hospice care. She was able to make one last trip -- to the Bahamas to attend her daughter's wedding. In a follow-up interview with Mosier's daughters on this past weekend's ""Sanjay Gupta, MD,"" daughter Michelle Philipp told Gupta, ""We weren't sure until even (the) last minute if she was able to come. So we bought her the ticket, hoping it would give her something for her to look forward to, and she did, and it was just wonderful."" On June 29, 2012, Mosier died. Philipp's sister, Nicole Penninger, didn't hide her frustration with the situation. ""You feel like you're in this time now, it's 2012. You feel like, you're in America. Why can't she get these drugs, that she needs to treat something so serious?"" Critical dependence on a few companies . How did it get to this point? According to Naumann, ""We only have a couple of companies, and the problem is that if one of these companies goes down because of FDA inspections, manufacturing problems or something like that, we don't have those drugs if only one company is making them."" The House Oversight Committee came to the same conclusion. In a recent report, the panel claimed the FDA -- the very agency tasked with dealing with shortages -- is partly to blame for the shortage situation. The report paints a scathing picture of a regulatory agency that gave little consideration to the potential outcome of its actions. ""The committee has learned that FDA regulatory activity has effectively shut down 30% of the total manufacturing capacity at four of America's largest producers of generic injectable medications,"" it said. ""The FDA has failed to ensure that enforcement and compliance activities are conducted in a manner that does not create unnecessary shortages of critical drugs,"" according to the House report. That report is disputed by the FDA. ""Let me just say, very clearly, that the report is incorrect,"" Dr. Sandra Kweder of the FDA said on ""Sanjay Gupta, MD."" ""We are not in this situation because the FDA is shutting down companies. FDA is part of the solution."" Kweder is the deputy director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Office of New Drugs. She said FDA inspection processes and enforcement rules have not changed. ""What has changed is that there is an aging manufacturing infrastructure, and there are serious quality problems that have required companies to close down to fix the problems."" On Monday, the FDA issued a letter to Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Maryland) of the House Oversight Committee, responding to the committee's blaming the FDA for the shortages. The letter reiterated the report was false and emphasized the FDA is part of the solution. What happened with Doxil . While Doxil is not a generic drug, it was manufactured by Ben Venue Laboratories, one of the country's four largest producers of generic injectables. The Ben Venue lab was the sole manufacturer of Doxil in the nation. It voluntarily shut down in November 2011. A May 2011 FDA inspection found a string of problems, including inadequate oversight and metallic particle shards in some of the drugs produced on site. A November 2011 FDA inspection found additional problems, including finding a 10-gallon can in a storage area that contained urine. In a statement sent to CNN after it shut down, Ben Venue labs said its team ""has been working around the clock to implement changes needed to ensure a more sustained supply of the medicines we produce and to address the manufacturing-related issues at our facility noted in recent inspections by the FDA and other global regulatory agencies."" However, Ben Venue maintained that none of the Doxil supply was affected. From their findings, the House Oversight Committee found that 58% of the drugs on the shortage list were produced at facilities cited by the FDA. They also found that the FDA's warning letters increased 156% from 2010 to 2011. Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former FDA deputy commissioner, said the FDA isn't concerned about the outcome, though. ""They go in, they inspect facilities and then they issue findings. You're not asked to worry if there's a stable supply. You're asked to make sure the facility falls in line."" But Kweder says it's quite the opposite. ""Well, it's our job to worry about it in our drug shortages team. When we issue warning letters today, we ask companies to very specifically communicate with us how they plan to address the problem, so we can assess what the potential of a shortage is, "" she told CNN. Kweder also cited the recent reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act as a key to preventing shortages. Signed by President Barack Obama earlier this month, the act will help the FDA expedite the drug review process, particularly for drugs in shortage. It will also require companies to notify the FDA if they anticipate an interruption in production. ""It allows us as a regulatory agency to step in, and try and prevent the shortage in the first place,"" Kweder said. ""So for example, we can go to other companies to ask them to increase their production. We can assist companies that are having difficulties to finding alternatives for the difficulties they are having, and even in rare cases, we can seek sources of medications from other countries, where they might be being produced to our standards."" Help comes from abroad . That's actually what happened in the case of Doxil. In February, the FDA stepped in and allowed the importation of Lipodox from an Indian manufacturer, a possible therapeutic alternative. But Naumann said he was never able to get his hands on it. ""The key is having enough notice,"" says Kweder. Since Obama signed an executive order requesting early notification from manufacturers in November 2011, more and more companies have been able to give the FDA the needed heads-up. ""We've done that successfully innumerable times. Just since January, at our count, we've prevented 94 to 100 shortages, things the public never sees,"" Kweder told Gupta. ""I think it's a start,"" says Naumann, but it's not enough. ""I think these shortages are going to continue because of the same problems that we have. There are certainly fixes out there for it. I don't think these shortages are going to go away because of this bill."" For Mosier's daughters, it's all too late. Had Mosier gotten the Doxil, Philipp says, ""I think she thought it would have at least put her in remission in another time, or it would save her from the chemo that was detrimental to her.""","Renee Mosier, who had cancer, died after not receiving the drug she needed .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. will come face to face with the man who helped inspire the ""Miracle of Medinah"" once more when it faces Europe at the 2014 Ryder Cup at Gleneagles. Ian Poulter, the man known as ""Mr Ryder Cup"" will be part of the European side after securing a wildcard pick from captain Paul McGinley. Poulter is joined by Scotsman Stephen Gallacher and England's Lee Westwood -- but there is no room for former World No.1 Luke Donald. Poulter, 38, won all four of his matches two years ago as Europe came back from the brink to record an astonishing 14½ - 13½ victory. Westwood, who made his Ryder Cup debut in 1997, has won 21 points in 37 matches and has appeared in eight editions of the competition. Gallacher, who will be playing in front of his home crowd, finished third at the Italian Open and only just missed out on automatic qualification. McGinley, the European captain, told a news conference that omitting Donald, who boasts an impressive Ryder Cup record, was one of his most difficult tasks. ""It was a very difficult conversation with him for a number of reasons,"" McGinley told reporters ahead of the match getting under way on September 26. ""My relationship with Luke is very close. He has played in every Ryder Cup I've been involved in apart from 2008 which we both missed. ""I've partnered Luke twice in 2004 and 2006 and vice-captained him in 2010 and 12. I forged a very strong relationship with him. ""His Ryder Cup record is outstanding and he will no doubt go on to make many more appearances in the Ryder Cup. ""It was a difficult call but one I had to do in the interests of the European team."" Europe will be led by Rory McIlroy, the World No.1, while it also boasts four of the top players on the planet. Sweden's Henrik Stenson is joined by Spain's Sergio Garcia and England's Justin Rose, while there are also places for Thomas Bjorn, Martin Kaymer and Graeme McDowell. McGinley's team will also have two men making their debuts at the competition with Victor Dubuisson of France and Welshman Jamie Donaldson both having qualified.","Europe reveals wildcard picks for Ryder Cup .

"(CNN) -- As CEO of public relations agency Ruder Finn, Kathy Bloomgarden has spent much of her career shaping the corporate reputations of big name clients like L'Oreal, Microsoft, PepsiCo and Visa. With 30 years of experience in the field, she was first introduced to the world of communications by her father, David Finn, the co-founder of the firm. Bloomgarden doesn't just serve the public relations needs for over 250 corporations, governments and non-profits. She's also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and has written a book entitled, 'Trust: The Secret Weapon of Effective Business Leaders'. She opens up to CNN about her ascent to CEO and how she led Ruder Finn to become one of the world's largest privately-owned communications agencies. CNN: You speak about five languages and you've got three degrees. Where did you think that was going to take you in that time in your life? Kathy Bloomgarden: Well, I was always fascinated by languages and I wanted to be a global person. So I was fortunate enough to start learning French from even before school -- I began nursery school even... And that sent me on a journey for thinking about how I could really understand different societies and cultures and really be able to communicate with people and live locally in many different settings. CNN: Your father founded the company back in 1948 when the PR industry was in its infancy. He was something of a formidable thinker and a bit of a Renaissance man. Were you aware of his reputation growing up? KB: Absolutely. I was fortunate enough to be able to go around with him. And he worked for wonderful institutions, including the UN for many years -- so I met many of the Secretary Generals as a child. He worked for the Vatican, so I had a chance to meet the Pope and to attend mass at Christmas Eve. It was a very exciting, really inspiring time as I grew up serving as an interpreter in some of these countries when he was traveling. CNN: How hard is it to break out from the mold of being viewed as the boss' daughter? KB: You can't talk your way out of that one. You have to really deliver results. The more you can develop an exciting business and really do things that become a hallmark for the firm, that's when you gain your recognition. CNN: Looking back on your career, was there any particular ""Aha"" moment, when you realized, ""I've made it""? KB: I never would think that I've made it...As a typical American who came from an immigrant family, there's still something of that in my DNA. Everything could change tomorrow. So never think that you've made it. Always think, ""What am I going to do tomorrow to make sure that I'm still staying in a strong position? CNN: Do you ever get asked, ""How did you get here as a woman?"" KB: I always ask myself this question, maybe because I'm in the field of public relations. But people haven't -- I've never felt held back, in terms of my gender. But I always felt that I've had to work extra hard. So maybe that's why I didn't face that problem or challenge. CNN: The world of public relations is actually pretty female heavy already, isn't it? What are your thoughts on that? KB: I think there can be a reverse bias that sets in. I try to encourage men and women to come into communications....We might see more men coming into the PR firm because the remuneration is good...I think diversity both ways is a good thing. CNN: If you met somebody who had the same aspirations as you did when you first started out, what would your advice be to them? KB: Believe you can do anything you want to do is really the key for me. And don't be afraid. Take risks. Be really bold in your thinking. Close your eyes and dream about what you want to achieve and then just go and do it.

"(CNN) -- Pressure is inescapable in the cauldron of Ryder Cup competition -- pressure and ping pong. The intense rivalry played out on the course between the world's top players from Europe and the United States in golf's ultimate team test is only half the story. Away from the heat of battle on the greens and fairways, there is a wiff-waff war raging in the American team room, one Rickie Fowler can't wait to get stuck into. ""Once the Ryder Cup actually starts it's just fun from there -- very intense,"" Fowler tells CNN's Living Golf show. ""I enjoy the off-course too -- just being in the team room, spending time as a team, hanging out, playing ping pong! ""And hopefully if we can get that Ryder Cup then Sunday night would be pretty good."" Phil Mickelson hired a coach before last year's Presidents Cup in a bid to blow away his teammates on the table, but this time his erstwhile ping pong partner Tiger Woods is missing through injury. Perhaps Fowler is the man to fill the void on both counts. The Californian's golf is certainly in fine shape after a stellar season in which he finished in the top five of each of this year's four major championships, a feat only previously achieved by Woods and Jack Nicklaus. Entry to an illustrious club that boasts 32 major titles is a measure of Fowler's progress, notwithstanding the residual disappointment at not converting one of those opportunities. Twice, at the British Open and most notably at the U.S. PGA Championship, Fowler was pipped to the crown by Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy, who has vowed to lead Europe's charge for the Ryder Cup in Scotland this week. Given Fowler's consistency in 2014, it is possible to make a case for him as the spearhead of a U.S. team that has not won the Ryder Cup since 2008. Defeat at Celtic Manor in Wales back in 2010 was Fowler's first taste of the tournament, but he was omitted for the infamous ""Miracle of Medinah"" in 2012 when Europe stormed from 10-4 behind to take the cup in dramatic fashion. That has only sharpened his focus ahead of the 40th incarnation of the prestigious event at Gleneagles. ""With the past few cups going to Europe I feel like this is one that we need to win,"" Fowler says. ""I feel like Gleneagles is a good venue for the United States and I feel like we are putting together a good team. ""I am excited to be on the team and, being on there in 2010 and coming up short, I want to be on the other side of that this year."" The 25-year-old's debut four years ago came courtesy of a wildcard pick by captain Corey Pavin. He'd been part of the USA's success on British shores the previous year in the Walker Cup -- the Ryder Cup's amateur equivalent -- which gave him a head start. Fowler, the third-youngest golfer to play in the Ryder Cup behind Horton Smith and Tiger Woods, was forced to find his feet quickly. Playing foursomes alongside veteran Jim Furyk, Fowler took a drop from the mud early in their contest with Lee Westwood and Martin Kaymer, but dropped a different ball to the original, costing the U.S. the hole. Despite being behind for 16 of 17 holes, Fowler held his nerve to make a birdie putt on the last and rescue half a point for his side. Then on the final day as a nailbiting, weather-afflicted tussle neared its climax, Fowler birdied four of his final six holes to snatch an unlikely half point from his match with Italy's Edoardo Molinari and keep the overall contest alive. Though Graeme McDowell, that year's U.S. Open champion, closed out a 14½ - 13½ victory for Europe in the final singles match, Fowler had shown he belonged on the transatlantic stage. ""The Ryder Cup 2010 -- it was special for me because I had just turned pro basically a year prior,"" he recalls. ""I came off playing the Walker Cup in '07 and '09 so I was ready for the stage and I definitely enjoyed it. ""I put myself in a position where I was able to help the team have a chance at getting the Cup but we were just a little too far back to make it happen."" The Ryder Cup represents a rare week in the calendar where golfers aren't wholly operating as lone wolves -- and they play for pride, not cash. This altered reality demands different traits and often brings out the best in some players -- European talisman Ian Poulter being a prime example. It also means a sense of shared responsibility, a nation and teammates to do proud. ""The team events are so much different than a week-to-week tournament or even majors,"" Fowler explains. ""You are playing for so much more than just yourself. You know you have got your fellow teammates, the captains and not to mention your country. ""When you do play the alternate-shot matches there is a bit of teamwork there with the guy you are paired with. But golf is still very individual. ""I mean you go out there and really all you can control is your emotions and the shots you hit -- you may be able to go and show support for other teammates but for the most part it about everyone coming together and playing well. ""So it is just fun to have that little extra added pressure and to play well and feel the satisfaction that you did it for your teammates, the captains and then your country.""","Rickie Fowler says 2014 Ryder Cup is one United States ""need"" to win .

"(CNN) -- Europe's Ryder Cup selections endured largely disappointing finishes to the final build-up tournament before the biennial clash gets underway later this week as Dutchman Joost Luiten won the Wales Open Sunday. Luiten overcame a poor start to his round at Celtic Manor, venue for the 2010 Ryder Cup, to finish on 14-under after a level par 71. It was his fourth victory on the European Tour, but his late season form came too late to earn him a spot in Paul McGinley's team to face the United States at Gleneagles next Friday. Luiten had to battle to salvage a par-five on the 18th to hold off England's Tommy Fleetwood and Ireland's Shane Lowry at Celtic Manor. Fleetwood finished with a six-under burst for the last five holes and Lowry also birdied the 18th to set the target for Luiten. ""It was tough, it was hard work down the last,"" said Luiten . Four members of McGinley's 12-strong team were in action in Wales with Ryder Cup debutant Jamie Donaldson the best placed. He birdied the last for a 67 to finish on 12-under and a tie for fourth alongside Belgian Nicolas Colsaerts, England's Eddie Pepperell, Scotland's Marc Warren and Edoardo Molinari of Italy. But Denmark's Thomas Bjorn and Lee Westwood of England were distinctly out of sorts in their final tune ups. Veteran Bjorn shot a 74 to finish one over par and a rusty Westwood struggled to a 76 for two over. He will be making his ninth appearance later this week and was unfazed by his poor display. ""I hit a few good shots (this week), not so good today, but I probably had one eye on next week. I don't think the concentration and the focus was there,"" he told the European Tour website. ""The Ryder Cup is very special, I am looking forward to getting there tonight and preparing for Friday when it starts."" At least Westwood and Bjorn made the cut. Stephen Gallacher, making his debut as one of McGinley's picks, failed to make the weekend. Meanwhile, world number one Rory McIlroy said he was looking forward to capping his remarkable year with a third Ryder Cup triumph. ""Personally for me it would just be the icing on the cake of what's already a fantastic year,"" he told Sky Sports. ""It's way better to win as part of a team. The best experiences in my golf career have been the Ryder Cup and to be able to celebrate with all these guys. It's very special."" McIlroy famously nearly missed his tee time ahead of the final day singles match at Medinah in 2012, but made it with minutes to spare to beat Keegan Bradley as Europe completed a remarkable comeback to retain the trophy.","Joost Luiten wins Wales Open at Celtic Manor .

"(CNN) -- After a hole-in-one at the KLM Open in Amsterdam, golfer Andy Sullivan has won a prize that is truly out of this world. The Englishman, who found the cup with his tee shot on the 15th hole, bagged himself a flight into space courtesy of a Dutch aerospace company. XCOR Aerospace pledged a 62-minute space flight to any player who could card a hole-in-one at the 15th at the Kennemer Golf and Country Club. The trip is valued at between $95,000 and $115,000. ""My caddie just shouted to me, 'we're going to space'. I was in hysterics. It's just an unreal experience. I didn't play great through the round and then I hit a shot like that,"" Sullivan told the European Tour's official website. Before boldly going where no professional golfer has gone before, Sullivan needs to run the idea by his wife. ""I'm not sure if I'll go, I'll check with the missus,"" said Sullivan. ""I'm not great with heights or flying! I might have to pluck up some coverage. I don't think spaceman is a new nickname for me. ""My daughter will think I'm the best dad in the world -- a professional golfer and an astronaut, she's got the best dad in the world!

"(CNN) -- In 2000, only 11.7 percent of Fortune 500's board members were women. Today, that figure is still disappointingly low at just 16.9 percent. Heather McGregor, a former investment banker turned headhunter, thinks she might know why this is. As managing director and principal shareholder of the executive search company Taylor Bennett, she recently wrote ""Mrs Moneypenny's Careers Advice for Ambitious Women."" Speaking at this year's Names not Numbers conference, an event where CNN International was a media partner, McGregor explains that the sooner women accept that they can't have it all, the better. ""The biggest challenge to women in the workplace that still hasn't changed is the level of unconscious bias. So people have in their minds that they would prefer not to hire or promote a woman and they don't even realize that they feel like that. I know as a headhunter that if I propose two candidates of equal skills, maybe they're both in their mid thirties, one's a man and one's a woman, and the woman has recently gotten married, assuming there's nothing else to choose between them, the employer will choose the man and that's even if the employer is a woman."" ""The best careers advice I've ever received myself, which was so good that I wrote a whole book based on it, is that the way we can smash the myth of the glass ceiling is to smash the myth that women can have it all. To really pursue a career is no different to pursuing your gold medal in the Olympics. You have to make choices and they're not always easy. In my experience, if you try and do everything well what will end up happening is you will end up disappointing everyone. Much better to disappoint a very small number of people and everybody else is not disappointed, and furthermore supportive of you and your career."" ""People still think that women are not going to be as reliable a hire as a man, especially in those mid years. It's a sad truth today, and I hope this will change, that women have to not just be as good as a man, but better. Because if you're faced with two people and one of them is a 35-year old woman with a wedding ring, and she's noticeably better than the man, you'll still hire the 35-year-old woman with a wedding ring.""","Only 16.9 percent of Fortune 500's board members are women .

"New York (CNN) -- A Long Island couple wants to trademark the slogan ""Occupy Wall St."" with the intent to sell sweatshirts, T-shirts, bumper stickers and hobo bags, among other merchandise. ""I'm no marketing genius, but when you got something that's across 50 states, it's a brand now,"" said 44-year-old Robert Maresca of West Islip, New York. Maresca's wife, Diane, filed a trademark application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on October 18 and paid a fee of $975. The move has some Occupy Wall Street supporters perplexed. ""The goal of OWS is not to become a profitable business,"" said Tyler Combelic, an Occupy Wall Street spokesman. ""Anything that misconstrues it as such, such as trademarking for the sake of profiting, is missing the point of protest."" But Robert Maresca sees things differently. ""I'm the best person they could imagine buying the slogan, because no one has their interest more than myself,"" he said. ""This is an important slogan; somebody else might have gotten a hold of it."" A former union iron worker, Maresca is now a stay-at-home father of three after suffering a stroke and sustaining a work injury nine years ago. He said he became a supporter of Occupy Wall Street once the union began backing the cause. ""I'm also really against corporate money distorting elections,"" he said. Maresca, who calls himself a ""fiscally conservative but socially liberal"" political independent, said his idea stemmed from creating shirts drawn with markers down on Wall Street. But it was his wife -- whom he describes as apolitical -- who filed the application because Maresca does not have a credit card. But Combelic said Maresca's attempt runs counter to the Occupy Wall Street mission. ""I think they are taking what is meant to represent 99% of America and instead making it represent an individual,"" he said. Steve Mancinelli, an intellectual property lawyer in New York, said legally, ""you don't get to own words because you think them up."" He said that the Marescas' ""intent of use"" application would be approved if they have a ""bona fide intention"" to produce items for commerce. It would take two to three months until the application is reviewed, at which point a separate ""use"" application will need to be submitted, Mancinelli said. Trademark privileges would give the Marescas' ownership of ""Occupy Wall St."" the brand, as well as the use of such text on merchandise labels. Mancinelli said he, too, was confused that ""someone from the OWS gang, which has demonstrated anti-capitalist ideals, would engage in a fundamental capitalist activity, like trademarking."" When asked where proceeds would go, Robert Maresca said, ""it's my intent to have them (Occupy Wall Street supporters) get the maximum benefit possible after any expenses."" While Maresca said it was too soon to make any promises, ""it is my hope to transfer ownership of the trademark to OWS if it's feasible."" He said he would even sell the trademark to Occupy Wall Street members, if they wanted it, for just $1 -- after they repaid his expenses. Combelic said he doesn't think fellow Occupy Wall Street protesters will be too eager to don trademarked ""Occupy"" clothing. ""We already make T-shirts down there for free, screen-printing on site,"" he said. ""We think that organic individual marketing -- making our own buttons or T-shirts -- is more valuable.""","Robert Maresca wants to use the slogan to sell clothes, stickers and accessories .

"Washington (CNN) -- Trying to strike a balance between shedding his isolationist label and defending his nontraditional GOP views on foreign policy, Sen. Rand Paul took another jab Tuesday at his more hawkish colleague, Sen. John McCain. In a discussion hosted by Paul Gigot, editorial page editor at The Wall Street Journal, Paul argued he's not in favor of a total abandonment of U.S. intervention overseas but was unapologetic in saying he's ""one of the least reluctant to go to war."" ""If I'm ever commander-in-chief, I will not want to take the country to war,"" the Kentucky Republican said. ""It will be the last resort and only when the country is united."" Paul said he's not staking out an ""all or none"" approach on U.S. intervention. ""But I do believe less. I believe we've been everywhere all the time. We're about to bankrupt our country and there is great danger to what we've been doing,"" he said. ""I want less. McCain wants more. He wants 15 countries more or 15 wars more."" His comments came at The Wall Street Journal's annual meeting of the CEO Council, an audience that overwhelmingly favors former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush as the 2016 Republican presidential nominee. The jab against McCain marks the latest hit in an ongoing back-and-forth between the two senators over foreign policy. This summer they sparred publicly after Paul repeatedly pushed a widely-debunked claim that the Arizona senator took a photo with ISIS leaders when he went to Syria last year. In turn, McCain blasted Paul for appearing to waver on his views about the fight against ISIS, saying Paul's change in tune weakened his ""credibility"" and argued he wouldn't be a good commander-in-chief on national security issues. Brian Rogers, a spokesman for McCain, responded to Paul's latest comment on Tuesday. ""It's hard to take seriously the claims of someone who repeats debunked conspiracy theories spread by America's adversaries that Sen. McCain met with ISIS,"" Rogers said. In Paul's remarks at the event, he brought up a Bloomberg/Des Moines Register poll from Iowa, saying that he liked how they framed a question on foreign policy asking whether the U.S. should be quicker to intervene in foreign conflicts ""as John McCain suggests"" or less interventionist, ""as Rand Paul suggests."" With 41 percent agreeing with Paul's position -- slightly fewer than the 45 percent who sided with McCain -- Paul argued that a significant bulk of the electorate is on his side and pushed back against criticism that he maintains fringe views on national defense. ""That's a caricature and I'll have to fight that, but we'll see what happens,"" he said.","Sen. Rand Paul advocated for ""less war"" at a conference in Washington on Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- It's the most controversial issue since people started filming videos in portrait mode. Should tablets be used as cameras? Whipping out a tablet to take a photo is a practice that, like it or not, is going mainstream. Once primarily the domain of dads who don't mind embarrassing their children, tablet photography has become so common that Apple added serious camera features to its new full-sized iPad. Why, when it's very likely they have a smartphone with a better camera, do people use tablets to take photos and videos? ""I think people look a little silly doing it but I can understand why,"" said Amit Gupta, founder of Photojojo.com. ""It's like the world's biggest viewfinder."" Traditional cameras have small viewfinders that, when you put your eye to them, fill your entire view with a scene. Smartphone screens are dinky in comparison. Someone who struggles to see a phone screen, especially when holding the device in outstretched arms, may enjoy the extra real estate of a tablet. Editing is also much easier on a tablet. On a smartphone, post-production is usually limited to a few tweaks and an Instagram filter, but a tablet is large enough to be a decent canvas for editing. Gupta's site is a popular shop for mobile photography accessories. Since the iPad debuted, he has seen a jump in the number of people buying tablet-specific photography tools, like the iOgrapher iPad Video Rig. For critics, a better view isn't enough to justify pulling out a tablet instead of a phone or real camera. Aside from the camera quality, there are a number of reasons for the stigma against tablet photography -- including what professional photographer and instructor Steve Simon calls ""the dorky factor."" Wielding a large flat rectangle to take a photo is awkward. The thin smooth frame is made for gripping with two hands or resting on a surface, not holding it above your head while you tap to focus a shot. Light bouncing off the large glossy screen can create unfortunate glare, especially outdoors. The shape and size can also have an impact on a final photo. Cameras have an effect on their subjects. A person will act differently in front of a large professional DLSR setup versus a smartphone or tablet. ""As a street photographer where keeping a low profile is hugely helpful to capture real moments, using a large tablet is the opposite of 'stealthy,'"" said Simon, who teaches a course on street photography. ""I find the tablet photographer looks a bit invasive and aggressive holding that big device in front of whatever or whoever they aim it at."" It's not just the person they're photographing that might be put off. Events like concerts are already turning into obnoxious seas of smartphones being held in the air. The only thing worse is the person who holds up a tablet, blocking other peoples' views. Early tablet photographers clearly aren't too concerned about what other people think, or the hardware's limitations. Apple's upgrades mean the practice could catch on with more people and shed some negative associations. Remember, there was resistance to smartphone photography at first, too, but it took off because people always had the devices in their pockets and sharing was instant. The photos weren't great quality but using a phone was convenient, and ""the best camera is the one that's with you"" became a rallying cry. The iPad Air 2's main camera is now competitive with the iPhone 6. It has an eight megapixel sensor and a number of camera features previously only found on iPhones, including time-lapse video, slow-motion and burst mode. Apple says its new iPad Air screen has been redesigned and given an anti-reflective coating to reduce glare by more than half. Inside, there's a more powerful graphics processor, which makes the tablet a great tool for editing. The number of full-featured photo and video editing apps for the iPad is growing: Apple demonstrated the new Pixelmator iPad app at its press event, using it to remove an unwanted oryx from a desert scene. There are still many valid reasons for not using a tablet as a camera, but the upgraded iPad camera chips away at some of them. The increased range in sizes for mobile devices is also helping blur the lines between phones and tablets. ""There's going to be less stigma because everyone's toting around these bigger phones,"" said Gupta. ""It's going to become a little easier to justify pulling out the iPad.""","Some say it's dorky to take photos with a tablet .

"(CNN) -- Another landmark decision has been made on the day Scotland decides on independence from the United Kingdom and this vote is in favor of union. The Royal & Ancient Club of St Andrews abandoned its 260-year men-only membership policy Thursday and voted to allow women to join its ranks. More than three quarters of the club's membership returned ballot papers, with 85% voting in favor of the change. A two thirds majority was required under the R&A's constitution. ""This is a very important and positive day in the history of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club,"" said its secretary Peter Dawson. ""This vote has immediate effect and I can confirm that The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews is now a mixed membership club. ""The membership has also acted to fast-track a significant initial number of women to become members in the coming months,"" added Dawson. Female golfers are already able to play on the famous links course on the east coast of Scotland but until now they were not allowed to enter the clubhouse as members or take any part in club decisions. In March this year, the Royal & Ancient Club decided to ask its 2,500 male members across the globe to change his historic policy. It also asked its members to agree to allow 15 new female members to join immediately. The decision to ratify both the proposals was announced at the club's annual meeting Thursday September 18, coincidentally the same day as the Scottish referendum. ""Society is changing, sport is changing, golf is changing,"" R&A chief executive Peter Dawson commented before the decision was announced. Organizers of the global game have come under increasing pressure to abandon what is seen as an archaic single-gender policy. In 2012, Augusta National allowed female members to join the prestigious U.S. club for the first time in 80 years. Augusta, which hosts the Masters, faced years of protests with President Obama also adding pressure on the organization. Former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and South Carolina financier Darla Moore became the first women to be admitted as members. The R&A, which serves as golf's governing body outside of the U.S. and Mexico, was criticized ahead of the 2013 British Open for choosing East Lothian's Muirfield, which has a male-only membership policy, to host Europe's only major. Muirfield remains as one of three courses on rotation to host the Open, along with Royal Troon and Royal St George's, which do not accept female members. The historic decision by the Royal & Ancient Club -- which will host the 2015 Open -- is another important step towards phasing out one of golf's most controversial traditions. The St Andrews club was established in 1764 and is regarded as the historic home of golf. Welcoming female members ensures the Royal & Ancient remains relevant in an egalitarian, new future.","Royal & Ancient Golf Club votes in favor of admitting female members .

"(CNN) -- Former world number one Tiger Woods missed the cut for only the third time in a major tournament as American duo Jason Dufner and Keegan Bradley lead the way after the second round of the U.S. PGA at Johns Creek, Atlanta. Woods, who is playing only his second tournament after four months out with injuries to his left leg, carded a three-over-par 73 to go with his opening 77 for a 36-hole total of 150 (+10), six shots off the cut. The 35-year-old, who has won 14 majors, has previously failed to make the final two rounds at the 2006 U.S. Open and the 2009 British Open, and on this occasion it means he will not be able to compete in the PGA Tour playoffs for the FedExCup. Bobby Jones: The gentleman who shaped modern golf . Only the top 125 players in this year's rankings are eligible to compete and the world number 30 was ranked 129th prior to the start of the tournament. ""I'll have nothing to do now but work on my game,"" Woods told the PGA Tour website after confirming he will not play until November's JBWere Masters in Australia. ""Sean Foley (coach) and I haven't had the opportunity to really sit down and do a lot of work, so this will be our time."" Woods, who recorded five double bogeys over two rounds for the first time in any tournament, added: ""I showed signs that I can hit the ball exactly how I know I can but unfortunately I just didn't do it enough times. ""This year has been frustrating because I was feeling healthy going into the Masters, put it together there, and was leading the tournament with a few holes to go. ""Then obviously I got hurt and I haven't played since, really. I have not been able to practice and work and obviously compete."" Woods was not the only big name player to miss the cut on a day when some of the PGA Tour's lesser lights shone. World number three and defending champion Martin Kaymer was the biggest casualty, missing out by a single shot after rounds of 72 and 73. Top overseas players Angel Cabrera, Justin Rose, Ernie Els, Geoff Ogilvy, Louis Oosthuizen, Vijay Singh, Jose Maria Olazabal, Graeme McDowell and British Open champion Darren Clarke are also all on their way home. Meanwhile, top American names Anthony Kim, Dustin Johnson, John Daly and Lucas Glover will not be returning for the final two days. However, home players are dominating proceedings at the other end, with Bradley carding a best-of-the-day six-under 64 to share the lead with Dufner, who posted a 65, on 135 (-5). The 34-year-old Dufner, who has never won on the PGA Tour, is a surprise leader having missed five of his last six cuts, but 25-year-old rookie Bradley has been a revelation in his first season, winning the prestigious Byron Nelson Classic earlier this year. The pair hold a one-stroke lead over compatriots Jim Furyk, Scott Verplank and D.A. Points, along with Australian John Senden. A further four players, including leading European Anders Hansen of Denmark and overnight leader Steve Stricker -- who followed up his opening 63 with a disappointing 74 -- are another shot behind. Last week's Bridgestone Invitational winner Adam Scott is among three players just three shots off the lead, while world No.2 Lee Westwood is four off the pace after a 68 and world No.1 Luke Donald is six behind after carding a 71.","Tiger Woods misses the cut at the U.S. PGA Championship on 10-over .

"(CNN) -- First came relief for Keegan Bradley, Hunter Mahan and Webb Simpson. Then thoughts turned to redemption. The trio have been selected as wildcard picks by United States Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson for the biennial team clash with Europe that starts later in September. And all three have memories from their previous appearance in golf's most enduring team contest they are desperate to erase. For Bradley and Simpson -- both major winners -- it is banishing the demons from the ""Miracle of Medinah"" two years ago. The USA was on course for its first Ryder Cup victory since 2008, before Europe overturned a 10-6 deficit on a dramatic final day. Both Simpson and Bradley succumbed in the singles, to Ian Poulter and Rory McIlroy respectively, and are keen to make amends at Gleneagles in Scotland. ""I've made no secret of how important this team is to me and how badly I want to go back and win the Ryder Cup,"" Bradley told a press conference in New York at which Watson revealed his selections. ""I think this is a redemption year for a lot of guys who were on the team in 2012."" Bradley returned three points in Chicago thanks to a formidable partnership with five-time major champion Phil Mickelson. The 2011 U.S. PGA Championship winner has had an up and down year but has recorded top 20 finishes in his last five events. ""He has the ability to hit the ball a long way and he came up to Gleneagles with me before the (British) Open Championship to play a practice round,"" Watson explained of his decision to pick the 28-year-old. ""He teamed up great with Phil Mickelson at Medinah and the most important thing he brings to it is his unbridled passion."" Simpson, the 2012 U.S. Open champion, was 15th on the qualification points list, lower than Chris Kirk who won the most recent PGA Tour event at the Deutsche Bank Championship. He said it was ""the greatest call"" he'd ever received when Watson contacted him to tell him the news. ""It was a week that I will never forget,"" he said of 2012. ""It was one of those weeks where it felt like we were going to win and it was kind of a shock Sunday afternoon. ""I'll never forget the feeling that I had watching the other team celebrate. They were all smiles and having fun, we had our heads down and it wasn't a good feeling. ""Two years has gone by very quickly and I remember all my matches like they were yesterday. I am eager to get back in the mix and try to get back the Ryder Cup."" Medinah was Simpson's first Ryder Cup appearance, and he won two matches and lost two. Those wins were emphatic -- 5&4 -- both alongside two-time Masters champion Bubba Watson. And it was those big victories that persuaded captain Watson to select him. ""After struggling with a couple of different players, who was going to be the best for the team, I had a revelation this morning,"" the 64-year-old said. ""I looked at the last time the Ryder Cup was played and I see Webb Simpson 5&4, Webb Simpson 5&4 and I said 'that's got to be the guy'. Webb played in 2012, did very well. ""He has the ability to go real low but more important in our conversations, I liked his desire to be on the team. He showed such a strong desire to be in the team and he has had the performance this year to be one of the picks."" Watson's final pick -- Hunter Mahan -- is also out for redemption, but for the 2010 Ryder Cup, having missed the last transatlantic tussle. The 2010 installment, at Celtic Manor in Wales, saw the outcome go down to Mahan's singles match with Graeme McDowell, the Northern Irishman defeating him to seal Europe's victory. Mahan was a long way down the points list but has enjoyed a recent surge in form, finishing seventh at the U.S. PGA Championship before winning the recent Barclays tournament in the season-ending FedEx Playoffs. ""Losing lingers,"" Mahan said of his 2010 experience. ""It's been four years, but it feels like yesterday. I remember walking off the green and everyone was having a big party, and I felt like I was walking by myself for 600 yards to the clubhouse. ""The guys had a tough time at Medinah and I had a tough time in 2010, so we have a lot to play for on this team. Winning is everything in golf and I could not have won a bigger tournament at the right time."" Earlier on Tuesday, European captain Paul McGinley chose Steven Gallacher, Ian Poulter and Lee Westwood as his three picks. The action begins on September 26.","United States Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson picks his three wildcard choices .

"(CNN) -- Jacques Kallis has crowned his final Test appearance with an innings that typifies his status as one of cricket's greatest batsmen. The 38-year-old posted a defiant 115 runs on Sunday as South Africa piled up 500 against India in the second Test of the series in Durban. It was his 45th century in the five-day format, leaving Kallis behind only the record 51 set by Sachin Tendulkar -- who retired from the game last month. The innings also lifted Kallis into third place in the all-time Test run-scoring standings, above Tendulkar's compatriot Rahul Dravid with 13,289 in his 166th match. Kallis, who announced before the match that it would be his last, had resumed on his overnight score of 78. He was dismissed soon after passing Dravid, and Dale Steyn then fell for 44, but Robin Peterson (61 off 52 balls) and Faf du Plessis (43 off 70) combined to give the top-ranked home team a first-innings lead of 166 against No. 2 India. The tourists then slumped to 68-2 when bad light ended play on day four, still trailing by 98 overall. While that two-Test series is evenly poised after a draw in the opening match, Australia cantered to a 4-0 lead in the Ashes against England on Sunday. The home side will seek to inflict an embarrassing whitewash in the final Test after triumphing by eight wickets in Melbourne. Resuming day four on 30-0 in pursuit of 231 for victory, the Australians lost just two wickets as veteran opener Chris Rogers made 116 from 155 deliveries and Shane Watson was undefeated on 83 off just 90 balls faced, hitting 11 boundaries. Captain Michael Clarke hailed his team after bouncing back from a poor first innings, which had given England a 51-run advantage. ""I think for the first time in this series, we were behind in a Test match -- and we had to find a way to claw our way back into it,"" Clarke told reporters. ""We let ourselves down with the bat -- certainly our top six batters didn't bat as well as we would have liked in the first innings.

"(CNN) -- Frankie Huff is working on her doctoral degree in Florida and can tackle most complicated education theories with ease. That's not the case when it comes to picking a health insurance plan through her school. ""It is daunting -- at times, more difficult to interpret than the scholarly research I pore through for my own dissertation,"" Huff said. ""I feel like handing it over to my partner after the first page."" Welcome to open enrollment season -- a season some people dread more than tax time. While you've been hearing a lot about Obamacare this week, the majority of Americans don't need to buy their policies through the new health insurance marketplaces, also called exchanges. Instead, most will get next year's health insurance through work. In fact, you probably have an e-mail sitting in your inbox right now reminding you to pick a plan. And Huff is not alone in her lack of confidence over how to pick the right policy. A good number of people look at that open enrollment e-mail and essentially take a wild guess at what plan works best for them, according to a recent study published in the Journal of Health Care Economics. Just 11% of the people surveyed could figure out what a four-day hospital visit would cost given a hypothetical insurance plan. These were people who thought they had a pretty good grasp on how health insurance works. ""Americans do seem a little terrified when it comes to making decisions about insurance,"" said Thomas M. Harte, the owner of Landmark Benefits Inc. in Hampstead, New Hampshire, and president of the National Association of Health Underwriters. ""When they come in I tell them they can relax and we have a casual conversation about what it is they are looking for in insurance and what's most important to them, and I try to take that fear away."" Studies show the more you know about your insurance plan the more you can save. Here are five things to think about when you pick your health plan for next year: . Be realistic . You want to look at three costs: your deductible, your maximum out-of-pocket costs, and the premium cost contribution compared to the year before. Glossary: Understanding health insurance terms . Just because it is the most expensive plan doesn't mean it is the right one for you. Not everyone needs a ""Cadillac plan,"" Harte says. Less than 10% of the population is admitted to the hospital every year. Look at what you spent last year. If you notice you didn't go to the doctor very much, or didn't get a lot of prescriptions, and you have some savings, pick the plan with the less expensive premiums. The deductibles will likely be higher, but even if you have to visit your primary care physician once or twice, it'll probably still be cheaper. Plus, with Obamacare, all plans that are not grandfathered in will cover preventive health services, whether you meet your deductible or not. Preventive health services include immunizations, blood pressure tests, mammograms, mental health services, smoking cessation programs, depression screening, diet counseling, and other services. Don't get sentimental . A lot of people stick with the kind of plan they've always had out of habit, but your life circumstances change over time. If you've had a new baby you may want one kind of plan that covers those costs. If your children have left home, you may not need as much coverage. Pick the policy that fits your current needs best. Harte says he often has to remind clients that with life changes, certain policies may be better than others. Understand your options . Employers often offer three types of plans: Point of Service, Preferred Provider Organizations and Health Maintenance Organizations. If you aren't attached to a particular doctor, you may want to pick the HMO option, which could save you some money. An HMO is typically the cheapest, but you've got to use doctors who are in that program's network. Even if you love your doctor, it doesn't hurt to check to see if he or she is in the HMO network as well. With a PPO you will likely pay a higher premium, but you'll have a wider variety of doctors to choose from. It will save you money to stick with those doctors, but you can also go out of network for a higher fee. A POS plan, which is a mix of an HMO and PPO, typically provides a wider variety of doctors as well. But with that plan you'll have to pick a primary care physician who will need to give you a referral to see any kind of specialist. POS plans are typically more expensive, but they give you the most flexibility. Each kind of plan comes with a standardized form that includes a summary of benefits and coverage. That's mandatory under Obamacare. Read through it. It will walk you through all the benefits of each plan so you can compare them easily. It should tell you how much you will pay for it. If something isn't covered by the plan, it should say so. Stay healthy . It may sound simple, but many people can pick a less expensive plan if they practice good health habits. Preventable illnesses make up 70% of health care costs, according to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine. Participate in your company's wellness program. Watch what you eat, exercise, don't smoke, drink less and maintain a proper weight. 11 simple weight loss tips . The less you need to go the doctor, the less you spend. The fewer unhealthy behaviors you have, the less your -- and others' -- insurance costs. For instance, it costs 18% more for an insurance company to provide coverage for a smoker, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Talk to the experts . Don't guess -- find a trusted adviser who can help walk you through the details. ""People are afraid to ask questions. You should never be afraid to ask,"" Harte says. Talk to someone who can explain terms to you or even help you just crunch the numbers. Your benefits person at work or a broker should be happy to help you figure out the plans and what's available.","Study: Many Americans are confused by health care insurance open enrollment .

"The rate of U.S. violent crime went up last year for the first time in nearly two decades due to a jump in assaults, the Justice Department said on Wednesday. Data collected by the Bureau of Justice Statistics in telephone surveys showed a 22 percent increase in assaults, pushing up the overall rate for violent crime for the first time since 1993. Crime rates have been declining steadily over the period and last year's increase compares with a record low figure for 2010. Statistics showed that the rate of assault victims increased from 19.3 per 1,000 persons to 22.5 per 1,000 last year. The statistics include 3.9 million simple assaults defined as crimes involving a threat but no weapon that resulted in relatively minor injuries. A second category described as serious violent crime include rape or sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault. An estimated 1.8 million such incidents occurred last year, but the increase from the previous year was calculated to be statistically insignificant. The results determined that the number of victims of the more serious crime category increased among whites and Hispanics, but not blacks, and among young men, but not among young women. The survey includes unreported crimes as well as those that were reported. Many citizens admit they didn't tell police about incidents in which they were victims. Roughly half of violent crime is unreported, according to the survey. The most closely watched annual crime statistics are scheduled for release on Oct. 29. The FBI's Uniform Crime Report is the most closely watched report of its kind and tabulates all reported crime nationally annually. Experts say they anticipate it will show a continued decline in overall crime. A preliminary report covering the first half of 2011 indicated total violent crime fell about 4 percent.","Assaults drive first increase in U.S. violent crime rate since 1993 .

"Phnom Penh, Cambodia (CNN) -- In a week where three top surviving leaders of the Khmer Rouge regime stand trial for crimes against humanity, the legacy of that era is still creating upheaval more than 30 years later. Land ownership is a vague and often contentious issue in a country where the Khmer Rouge destroyed all land records between 1975 and 1979. During this period, the regime pushed its utopian Communist ideal of an agrarian society forcing thousands from the cities to work in the fields in the countryside. An estimated 1.7 million people died during the Khmer Rouge reign. Twelve years ago, Myaeung Duong Kear bought land around Boeung Kak Lake -- a big lake in the center of Phnom Penh, now prized real estate. He bought the land from another resident who had claimed the land as their own. There was no real transfer of documents. Myaeung says he just got a piece of paper after the purchase which served as his record. He knew the transaction fell into a gray area, but that's the way things were done, he said. Myaeung built a home and set up a business inside his house fixing mobile phones. In September of this year, a developer's bulldozer knocked down his home, business and livelihood. 3 top Khmer Rouge leaders go on trial . The developer, Shukaku Inc., is owned by a powerful Cambodian senator, Lao Meng Khin, who signed a 99-year lease with the government for the lake property. The company has been in the process of filling in the lake and removing residents off the lake property to make way for plans to build luxury apartments and shops. The company and the government say the 4000 families -- including Myaeung Duong Kear's family-- who lived around the lake were removed because they were living in a designated development zone. CNN contacted the senator, who did not respond to requests for comment. The developers said they had achieved ""a peaceful conclusion"" to the dispute. Not for Myaeung, who has been homeless and protesting at the lake site since his ouster. ""I want to live here in this same place. It's the place that gave me happiness and security,"" Myaeung says. The Khmer Rouge regime banned private land ownership. When the Khmer Rouge lost power, many Cambodians resettled on plots of land wherever they could and essentially became ""squatters."" House and land titles were a distant notion. Rebuilding lives was the priority. In 2001, Cambodia passed a land law that allowed any Cambodian living peacefully on a piece of land for five years to apply for a land title. In 2002, the World Bank undertook several land titling projects to help Cambodians obtain legal ownership of their land. Countries like Canada, Germany and Finland contributed to these projects which resulted in more than a million land titles being issued. But the World Bank did not follow through on the land titling project around Beoung Kak Lake and in an inspection report, the World Bank later admitted to ""shortcomings."" ""The problem is a lot of Cambodians were excluded from the land titling projects if powerful people wanted that land,"" says David Pred of Bridges Beyond Borders Cambodia. ""They were excluded because in the end, it's the government itself that issues the land titles."" The protestors have made some progress through making noise. The World Bank has suspended loans to Cambodia until the government resolves the situation. Cambodia's prime minister got involved and signed a subdecree that allowed several families on 12.44 hectares of land around the lake to remain. Still, the majority of residents feel this is an injustice that is a long way from being resolved. They've been protesting in front of Phnom Penh City Hall on a regular basis. One displaced resident who moved to the relocation site designated by the developer says, ""It's difficult. It's far from the city so it's hard to do business. For this development project, people were forced away like cattle.""","A property dispute of land near central Phnom Penh pits residents against developers .

"(CNN) -- The Brazilian National Council of Justice, which oversees the nation's judiciary, passed a resolution Tuesday that denies notaries the right to refuse to perform same-sex marriages. In Brazil, notaries officiate marriages and civil unions. Recently, 12 Brazilian states began allowing same-sex couples to marry or convert their civil unions into marriages. However, since the Supreme Court does not carry legislative powers, it was up to each notary to officiate at their discretion, and many refused, citing the lack of law. Same sex marriage: Who will legalize next? Joaquim Barbosa, president of the Council of Justice, said in the decision that notaries cannot continue to refuse to ""perform a civil wedding or the conversion of a stable civil union into a marriage between persons of the same sex."" Barbosa, who also presides over the Supreme Court, says the resolution merely follows the transformation of society. ""Our society goes through many changes, and the National Council of Justice cannot be indifferent to them,"" he said. Civil unions between same-sex couples have been recognized in Brazil since 2011, after the Supreme Court ruled that the same rights and rules that apply to ""stable unions"" of heterosexual couples would apply to same-sex couples, including the right to joint declaration of income tax, pension, inheritance and property sharing. People in same-sex unions are also allowed to extend health benefits to their partners, following the same rules applied to heterosexual couples. Brazilian lawmakers have debated same-sex marriage, but in most cases, the bills introduced have not progressed through Congress. Brazilian neighbors Uruguay and Argentina are the only other two countries in Latin America that have laws allowing same-sex couples to marry.","In Brazil, notaries officiate marriages and civil unions, including same-sex ones .

Russian President Vladimir Putin's push in to Ukraine has the 28-nation alliance focused on action -- and that goes double for NATO's new members in the east, including Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. But the 65-year-old alliance's worries aren't limited to Eastern Europe. ISIS, the terror group that has declared an independent state in Iraq and Syria in recent months, is threatening to spew violent ultra-jihadists on to NATO members' streets. And Afghanistan, NATO's biggest overseas commitment of troops, is in flux, so adjustments are required there as combat troops prepare to depart at the end of the year. Last -- but by no means least -- as NATO looks to its future, it wants to build on its past. The alliance will seek to use lessons it has learned in nation-building to create advisory and training teams in a drive to carve out a role as a global security hub. Return to core mission . A rapid or readiness action plan will emerge and will likely include much of the following: . 1. Preparing thousands of troops that can be ready to deploy at 48 hours' notice. 2. Preposition defense equipment at bases in Poland and the Baltic nations. 3. Equipping troops for constant rotation through the bases in front line states for as long as needed -- rather than maintaining a permanent force, which would contravene the NATO-Russia founding act. 4. Extending measures for air policing of NATO states. 5. Considering an increase in NATO's naval presence in the waters around member states. The major issues on the table will include: . Afghanistan . This is expected to be the first major topic up for discussion. NATO's role there will change as U.S. troops draw down over the next two and a half years. The role of ISAF forces in the country will shift from leading Afghan troops in the fight to supporting Afghans in an advisory and training role. Asymmetric and hybrid threats . NATO is also expected to discuss the best way to face Russia's new hybrid, or asymmetric style of attack -- Putin's sending of masked, unidentified ""green men"" into Ukraine to intertwine with local militias, rather than deploying a traditional invasion force of armored vehicles and tanks. The solutions to this challenge may include any of the following: special forces, cyberwarfare, counterinsurgency, greater intelligence gathering, or stronger border security. The aim is to reassure those NATO nations who feel most exposed to Putin's new nationalist-fueled expansionism -- namely Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland -- but it's also to improve the readiness time with which troops can be deployed to defend NATO's interests in the east. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, who is attending the summit, will of course pay close attention to all these details, but as Ukraine is not a NATO member it may be of little direct benefit to him. The hope, of course, is that Putin will see NATO's resolve and recalibrate his westward adventurism. But nothing so far indicates that's remotely close to happening. In the interim, NATO leaders are expected to discuss how they can support Ukrainian democracy and strengthen security -- and also explore what further material and economic support they can offer to the war-torn country. Global Security Hub . Another major item on the agenda will be a discussion about NATO's role as a global security hub. The alliance is considering using its experience to build up the defense and security capacity of governments in hotspots around the world, using small teams of NATO advisers and trainers. Money . All NATO nations are obliged to commit 2% of their GDP on defense spending, but very few do. The U.S. spends 4.4% of its GDP on defense -- and President Barack Obama will be hoping to push the Europeans to keep closer to their commitment on this issue. ISIS . Obama is also keen to get NATO's support for tackling the growing ISIS menace emanating from Iraq and Syria. Perhaps indicating how late this issue has raced up the agenda, discussion on the topic may get it best airing at the summit dinner amid the trappings of historic warfare at Cardiff castle. Given the toxicity pervading discussion around Middle East intervention, the leaders will likely be hoping they don't leave the banquet with a bitter after taste.","NATO summit is called ""the most important gathering of NATO leaders in more than a decade""

"(CNN) -- Sri Lanka's high commissioner to Britain has blamed criticism of his country's human rights record on a ""proxy propaganda war"" being carried out by those who funded the nation's ""terrorist conflict."" The prime ministers of Canada, Mauritius and India have withdrawn from the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, or CHOGM, beginning in Colombo on Friday, amid concerns about the rights situation in Sri Lanka after its 26-year civil war with separatist Tamil rebels. Speaking to CNN's Fred Pleitgen for the ""Amanpour"" show on the eve of the summit, Chris Nonis said he was unsurprised by the criticism. ""One has to understand that there's a tremendous influence from those who funded the terrorist conflict who are now carrying out, really, a proxy propaganda war. ""What we realize is that over the years -- as people realize the wonderful reconciliation, rehabilitation and reconstruction program that we are carrying out in Sri Lanka -- that gradually that proxy propaganda war will lose its currency and, in that context, I think it's entirely right and fitting that we should host the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting,"" he said. ""There's a huge dichotomy of disjuncture between what is said abroad in terms of criticism and lack of rights and the freedom and the justice and equality that people are experiencing here."" The Commonwealth is a voluntary association of 53 nations that initially formed out of what had been the British Empire. Its charter focuses on developing ""free and democratic societies and the promotion of peace and prosperity to improve the lives of all peoples of the Commonwealth."" Heads of member governments meet every two years. International investigation . Asked about calls for an independent, international investigation into alleged war crimes -- a call repeated by British Foreign Secretary William Hague when he met his Sri Lankan counterpart on the sidelines of the meeting this week -- Nonis responded: . ""We don't need an international investigation when we have had a vibrant civilization for 2,500 years. We have perfectly educated people and I think we're perfectly capable of carrying out our own domestic inquiry."" Nonis said the leaders not attending the conference represent three of the five countries that are home to Sri Lanka's largest, wealthiest and strongest diaspora communities. ""Each country, each leader has their domestic political considerations. We understand that. After all, they're politicians,"" he said. He described UK opposition leader Ed Miliband's call for Sri Lanka to be stripped of its chairmanship of the Commonwealth as ""extremely silly"" and uninformed, saying his country had made ""enormous progress"" since its war ended in May 2009. ""We cherish the principles of democracy and development -- the twin pillars of the Commonwealth,"" Nonis said. ""We are a very decent, very human group of people. We've had a terrible conflict with the terrorists -- finally the people of Sri Lanka are free."" Civilian deaths . As many as 70,000 people were killed in Sri Lanka's war and in its final stage, which lasted from September 2008 to May 2009, the Sri Lankan army advanced into an area of the north where about 330,000 people were trapped by fighting. A U.N. report in 2011 said the government used ""large-scale and widespread shelling"" that left a large number of civilians dead. The number of civilian deaths and injuries are unknown to this day, and U.N. figures greatly differ from those in reports from Sri Lanka's government and various nongovernmental organizations. Sri Lankan President Mahinda Mahinda Rajapaksa told media Thursday he would ""not hesitate to take action against any human rights violations, adding that he has nothing to hide and is very open,"" according to a Sri Lankan government website. ""He said that Sri Lanka has a strong legal system, a Human Rights Commission, and now the Commonwealth is ready to strengthen it,"" it said. On October 7, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that he would not go to this week's meeting and that Deepak Obhrai -- the parliamentary secretary to the minister of foreign affairs and for international human rights -- would attend in his place. Canada is ""deeply concerned"" about the situation in Sri Lanka and believes that the government has failed to uphold the Commonwealth's core values, he said. ""The absence of accountability for the serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian standards during and after the civil war is unacceptable,"" Harper said. ""Canada noted with concern the impeachment of the Sri Lankan chief justice earlier this year and we remain disturbed by ongoing reports of intimidation and incarceration of political leaders and journalists, harassment of minorities, reported disappearances, and allegations of extra judicial killings."" On November 12, the Prime Minister of Mauritius, Navinchandra Ramgoolam, told lawmakers that he would not be attending the summit, sending his minister of foreign affairs instead. A government statement said Ramgoolam told the country's parliament that he had been monitoring human rights in Sri Lanka and was gravely concerned about violations there. ""Mauritius has never been and will never be indifferent to the human rights violation anywhere in the world, including Sri Lanka,"" he said. India's foreign minister . The prime minister of India, which has a large Tamil population, had faced domestic pressure to also withdraw from the conference. On November 10, India's Ministry of External Affairs said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had written to President Rajapaksa, saying that he too would not attend. External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid was chosen to represent India instead. Khurshid told CNN's Pleitgen on ""Amanpour"" Thursday that a number of factors may have influenced the decision to stay away, including coming elections and economic issues. ""And of course there were competing sentiments in the country about some outstanding issues with Sri Lanka, particularly on the rehabilitation and reconstruction that's imperative after the end of the war,"" he said. ""We have urged the government of Sri Lanka to take steps forward towards real and meaningful devolution and accountability."" He said India continues to urge speedier action but said: ""We can't see an alternative to engagement, particularly if it's a matter that concerns a friendly country in the neighborhood of India."" The Sri Lankan website says that Rajapaksa ""expressed satisfaction over Indian External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid attending the CHOGM summit. When an Indian reporter stated that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has skipped the conference in acceding to demands made by Tamil Nadu, the President said that he has not informed this to him and pointed out that the Indian Prime Minister did not even attend the previous summit in Perth two years ago."" 'Must be accountability' British Prime Minister David Cameron, who is attending the summit, issued a statement Thursday saying he sees it as ""an opportunity to raise our concerns clearly and directly, and to focus the eyes of the world on Sri Lanka."" ""Together we must say clearly to the government of Sri Lanka -- our hosts -- that there must be accountability for the past and respect for human rights today,"" he said. ""Four years on from the end of the civil war and defeat of the 'Tamil Tigers,' a brutal terrorist organization, there has been nowhere near enough improvement. We need to see more progress: genuine freedom of expression and the media, an end to the intimidation of journalists and human rights defenders, action to stamp out torture, demilitarization of the north and reconciliation between communities. ""And of course we need to see a thorough investigation into alleged war crimes.""","Sri Lanka is hosting the biannual Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM)

"(CNN) -- Vincenzo Nibali was rewarded for a bold late move to win the second stage of the Tour de France in Sheffield Sunday and don the coveted yellow jersey. The Italian champion was among a select group who had broken clear after a short but brutal climb on the outskirts of the Yorkshire city. They included reigning champion Chris Froome of Team Sky, his chief rival Spain's Alberto Contador and the favorite for the stage, Slovakia's Peter Sagan. But as they hesitated the 2013 Giro d' Italia winner put his head down and broke clear, never to be caught, holding a two second advantage over his chasers as he raised his arms in triumph at the finish. It was enough to put the Astana rider in the overall lead, but the climbing form shown Contador and Froome served notice they have taken fine form into the three-week classic. Nibali also believes he is a strong contender to be in yellow when the Tour finishes in Paris on July 27. ""I've always believed in my chances, I came here to do my best and with this win I think I've already shown a good sign,"" he told gathered reporters. ""Of course the Tour doesn't finish here, there's still a long way to go. I'm calm and confident."" Behind Nibali, Belgian Greg Van Avermaet and Michal Kwiatkowski of Poland took the minor places. Kwatkowski's ride was some consolation for the Omega Pharma Quick Step team after key rider Mark Cavendish pulled out of the Tour before the start of the 200km second stage. Cavendish suffered a dislocated shoulder and ligament damage in a high speed spill near the finish of the first stage in Harrogate Saturday. ""I'm devastated to be fair. I'm in pain as well,"" the former world champion told gathered reporters in front of the team's bus. ""I've got to go and get an MRI (scan) to see if it needs surgery, chances are it probably does. Unfortunately I'm likely to be out for a few weeks."" Cavendish crashed after touching wheels with Australia's Simon Gerrans and admitted the incident had been his fault as they battled for position in the final sprint. ""I tried to find a gap that wasn't there. I spoke to Simon after the stage, I asked if he was OK, and I also spoke to him on the phone later and apologized to him,"" added the 29-year-old Cavendish. The ""Manx Missile"", he hails from the Isle of Man, was looking to add to his 25 Tour de France stage victories, targeting the opening leg and the flat third stage from Cambridge into London. The likelihood that Cavendish would not start the second stage did not deter the hundreds of thousands of fans who watched the action in the county of Yorkshire, exceeding even the expectations of local organizers. ""I want to say to all the supporters at the Tour to enjoy it, it's going to be an incredible race. It was amazing to see the support that was out yesterday and I'm looking forward to watching it,"" he said. German sprint star Marcel Kittel, who had been in yellow after taking the first stage, was unable to keep pace on the climbs of the second day, but is expected to feature strongly on Monday's third leg from Cambridge to London when massive crowds are again expected.","Vincenzo Nibali goes into yellow after second stage win .

"(CNN) -- Why has the Obama administration been so reluctant to intervene in Syria? There are a host of reasons -- American fatigue with war, President Barack Obama's disinclination to start another conflict in the Middle East, and the splintered, fractured opposition to Bashar al-Assad. But one reason looms large: al Qaeda. Al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, Jabhat al-Nusra, is generally acknowledged to be the most effective force fighting al-Assad. Its fighters are willing to sacrifice themselves for the cause, are widely viewed as uncorrupt and are not involved in looting as other opposition forces are. A number of them are battle-hardened from other conflicts such as the Iraq War. Al Qaeda's Syrian affiliate is also well supplied as it benefits from the support of Sunni ultra-fundamentalists in the wealthy Gulf states such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Jabhat al-Nusra, which means the ""Victory Front,"" was listed as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department in December and is essentially a splinter organization of al Qaeda in Iraq. Al-Nusra's military prowess and close ties to al Qaeda make it a potentially serious threat to U.S. interests in the region, and the group has shown it has the ability to conduct massive suicide bombings. In November, al-Nusra claimed responsibility for 45 attacks in the provinces of Damascus, Deraa, Hama and Homs that killed dozens of people, including one suicide bomb that reportedly resulted in 60 casualties. It was the first insurgent organization in Syria to claim responsibility for attacks that caused civilian casualties. Despite these civilian casualties, the group has been able to garner considerable support from Syria's Sunni population, not only because it is the premier fighting force in the campaign to topple al-Assad but also because it is involved in providing critical services such as food, medical services and Sharia courts to the embattled population. Also, for the moment, al-Nusra is not imposing Taliban-style rule in areas that it controls as al Qaeda did in Iraq's massive Anbar province during the first years of the Iraq War. Al Qaeda's harsh rule in Iraq precipitated the 2006 ""Sunni Awakening"" in which Iraq's Sunni tribes rose up against the group. Al-Nusra seems to have learned from this mistake and is operating in a Hezbollah-like manner as a large-scale provider of social services, and with the consent of the population in the areas it controls. There is some confusion about how exactly al-Nusra fits into the larger al Qaeda network. Al Qaeda in Iraq released a statement in April announcing its official merger with al-Nusra, proclaiming that their joint organization would be called the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. A leader of al-Nusra later rejected the merger but pledged the group's support for al Qaeda's overall leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri. On June 9, Al Jazeera obtained a copy of a letter from al-Zawahiri annulling the merger. But a week later, in an audio recording posted online, al Qaeda in Iraq rejected al-Zawahiri's annulment of the merger, likely adding to the confusion of al Qaeda cadres. Syria is a particularly agreeable environment for al Qaeda. During the Sunni insurgency in Iraq that began in 2003, it was a key base for training and supporting foreign fighters. Al-Assad is also the perfect al Qaeda villain. He is an Shia Alawite and therefore a heretic in the eyes of the Sunni fundamentalists. He is a secularist and therefore an apostate in their view, and he is conducting a war without quarter against much of his Sunni population. Some 2,000 to 5,500 foreign fighters are believed to have traveled to Syria since the beginning of the Syrian conflict to join the rebels who aim to topple the Assad regime. Not all of them have necessarily joined jihadist factions of the rebel forces, but because most foreign fighters are drawn to the conflict because of a perceived religious responsibility, it is likely that these groups have drawn the lion's share of the foreigners. Even at high-end estimates, foreign fighters make up a small portion of the forces arrayed against the Assad regime: no more than 10%. Al-Nusra is the opposition group in Syria that attracts the most foreign fighters. It is believed that there are about 100 foreign fighters from the United Kingdom fighting in Syria. Experts say the number of Americans fighting in Syria is likely less than 10, and only a couple of instances of Americans fighting with al-Nusra have been confirmed. Eric Harroun, a former American solider, was charged in 2013 with conspiring to use a rocket-propelled grenade in Syria, and he admitted to fighting with al-Nusra.","Peter Bergen: U.S. may be reluctant on Syria due to role of al Qaeda-linked group .

"(CNN) -- ""I was surrounded by cameramen, all on their knees like proposing Victorian swains, shooting upwards to make my skirt look even shorter. I had no idea this was going to happen -- this was publicity that I certainly had not planned."" Model Jean Shrimpton. On a sultry spring day in 1965, silence descended on the packed crowd gathered at Australia's biggest sporting event. All eyes were on British supermodel Jean Shrimpton as she arrived at the prestigious Melbourne Cup Carnival -- or more accurately, all attention was focused on the 22-year-old's legs. ""The most beautiful girl in the world"" had stepped out at Flemington Racecourse wearing a minidress five inches above her knees, with no hat, stockings or gloves. In an era when women didn't leave the house without wearing a hat, it was an outfit which both scandalized the nation and sparked a fashion revolution which would define the Swinging Sixties. As the Melbourne Cup prepares for its 52nd ""Fashions on the Field"" competition, the iconic image of Shrimpton in ""that dress"" has gained almost mythical status in the history of a horse race now worth $6.2 million in prize money. Known as ""The race that stops a nation,"" it is one of the richest thoroughbred competitions in the world, and is so revered in its home state of Victoria that its annual date -- the first Tuesday in November -- has been made a public holiday. But in 1965 it was Shrimpton's legs which famously stopped the country in its tracks. ""She was one of the world's first supermodels and her visit was highly anticipated -- everyone was expecting this beautiful hat and accessories,"" Victoria Racing Club Art and Heritage curator Penny Tripp told CNN. ""When Jean came marching through the members' lounge two hours late with her boyfriend of the time -- Hollywood actor Terence Stamp -- in this casual dress, there was absolute silence."" The conservative country was rocked by the seemingly skimpy outfit and, for the first time since the inaugural race in 1861, the winning horse was knocked off newspaper front pages -- in favor of Shrimpton's legs. ""There she was, the world's highest-paid model, snubbing the iron-clad conventions at fashionable Flemington in a dress five inches above the knee, NO hat, NO gloves, and NO stockings!"" screamed Melbourne newspaper The Sun. ""The Shrimp,"" as she was known, had been employed by textile manufacturer DuPont de Nemours International to be a judge in the annual ""Fashions on the Field"" dress competition. The face of ""Swinging Sixties London"" was flown to other side of the world to promote DuPont's new fabric, Orlon, during the four days of the Melbourne Cup Carnival -- Derby Day, Melbourne Cup, Oakes Day and Stakes Day. Shrimpton was sent rolls of the material, designing her secret wardrobe with London dressmaker Colin Rolfe. With limited fabric, Rolfe was forced to create the now-famously short dress. Though Shrimpton appeared undeterred by the length, telling Australian Women's Weekly magazine: ""I always wear my day dresses above the knee."" DuPont quickly employed Melbourne milliner Adele Chapeaux to create a hat for Shrimpton's next appearances. The model complied -- for one day. By the end of the carnival she had converted back to her trademark stripped-back mod look. ""It had an enormous impact on the fashion world,"" Tripp said. ""Shrimpton credits the arrival of the miniskirt to her wearing it at Derby Day, though it was probably London designer Mary Quant who invented it the year before. ""Regardless, it was very much the pivotal moment of the introduction of the miniskirt to an international stage."" Despite the scandal, Melbourne designers copied the fashion icon in droves. The following year, newspaper The Age reported: ""Last year's controversial Miss Shrimpton would have passed unnoticed in the crowd this year. Anyone with hemlines below the knee looked very 'old hat.' "" Today, more than 350,000 people attend the Melbourne Cup Carnival, with 1,100 men and women taking part in last year's ""Fashions on the Field"" event. Competitors are judged on their originality, accessories, understanding of current fashion trends and deportment, with prizes including a Lexus IS 250C F Sport convertible. ""I think to the rest of the world, the Melbourne Cup probably looks like one big party -- and that's exactly what it is,"" said Angela Menz, the 2011 fashion competition winner. ""Everyone makes an effort to dress up. But it's done in a very different way to say, Ascot in England, for example. The lifestyle in Australia is quite relaxed -- we don't have to wear gloves and jackets because it doesn't get that cold. ""By today's standards, Shrimpton's dress was actually quite long."" This year, Menz is predicting lots of tall hats, rather than traditional large brims. ""Head wear has been getting quite sculptural, almost like a piece of art on the head,"" she said. Since Shrimpton first graced Flemington, international celebrities have become a regular feature of the Melbourne Cup, with high-profile appearances from Britain's Princess Diana in 1985, Kate Bosworth in 2006 and fellow American actress Sarah Jessica Parker last year. The Melbourne Cup is as much about its fashion stakes as its horses. But when it comes to groundbreaking outfits, no one has ever come close to ""The Shrimp.""","Model Jean Shrimpton caused outrage by wearing mindress to 1965 Melbourne Cup .

"(CNN) -- A 320,000-signature petition protesting Russia's stance on gay rights ahead of the Winter Olympics in Sochi early next year was presented to Olympic bosses in Switzerland on Wednesday. The petition, delivered to the International Olympic Committee headquarters in Lausanne by gay rights group All Out, calls on Russia to repeal its anti-gay propaganda law in advance of the Sochi Games. It also urges the IOC to condemn the law and urged Russia to ensure the security of all visitors, athletes and Russian people before, during, and after the Games. Implemented last month, after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed it into effect, the law bars the public discussion of gay rights and relationships anywhere children might hear. It has been condemned by Russian and international rights groups as highly discriminatory. ""Ironically, the global outcry is transforming Sochi into an amazing platform for Russians and athletes to defy the law and speak out on gay rights,"" said All Out co-founder and executive director Andre Banks. About 50 Swiss members of All Out joined leaders of the organization to present the petition, said All Out spokesman Guillaume Bonnet. Obama cancels talks with Putin ahead of G-20 summit . The IOC said last week that it had ""received assurances from the highest level of government in Russia that the legislation will not affect those attending or taking part in the Games."" But in a meeting Wednesday with All Out representatives, senior IOC staff said they would pursue a stronger, written commitment from the Russian government on the issue, Bonnet told CNN. Such direct meetings between senior IOC staffers and protest groups are very rare, Bonnet said -- and a sign that the IOC is taking the matter ""very seriously."" IOC spokeswoman Sandrine Tonge told CNN the IOC had met with representatives of All Out, received their petition and ""engaged in an open and constructive discussion."" The IOC reiterated its position ""that sport is a human right and should be available to all regardless of race, sex or sexual orientation,"" she said. ""The Games themselves should be open to all, free of discrimination, and that applies to spectators, officials, media and, of course, athletes. We would oppose in the strongest terms any move that would jeopardise this principle."" The All Out petition was accompanied by a letter from British actor Stephen Fry and thousands of signatures from former Olympians and athletes collected by the group Athlete Ally, to show solidarity with the gay community. Four-time Olympic gold medalist Greg Louganis, NFL linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo, tennis player Mardy Fish and Australian women's cricket player Alex Blackwell were among those to put their name to the call for equal treatment for all. Anger grows over anti-gay propaganda laws . Vodka boycott . There has been a groundswell of international concern over the anti-gay propaganda law and its potential impact on visitors to Russia for the Games. Protests have ranged from a number of bars around the world announcing a boycott of Russian vodka to calls from some quarters for a boycott of the Games themselves. All Out hopes its petition will encourage world leaders to put pressure on Russia to change its treatment of the LGBT community and to ensure equal rights for all Russian citizens before and after the Games, Bonnet said. ""Unless the Sochi Games set an example of the rights and freedoms being exercised without prejudice, the discriminatory anti-LGBT law will serve to punish people simply for being open about who they are and who they love,"" Anastasia Smirnova, from the Russian LGBT Network in St. Petersburg, is quoted by All Out as saying. ""We continue our call for world leaders, including the IOC, to speak out now before it is too late."" Asked Tuesday on NBC's ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno"" about Russia's treatment of the gay community, President Barack Obama said he had ""no patience"" with it. ""I've been very clear that when it comes to universal rights, when it comes to people's basic freedoms, that whether you are discriminating on the basis of race, religion, gender or sexual orientation, you are violating the basic morality that I think should transcend every country,"" Obama said. ""And I have no patience for countries that try to treat gays or lesbians or transgendered persons in ways that intimidate them or are harmful to them."" On Wednesday, the White House cited a ""lack of progress"" on human rights and civil society, among other issues, as a reason for canceling planned bilateral talks between Obama and Putin next month. Banks, of All Out, said Obama had ""really got the message right."" He added, ""Holding the Winter Olympics in Sochi with these laws in place is like holding the Games in Johannesburg at the height of apartheid."" Opinion: Make Olympics in Russia the gayest ever . 'Polite and tolerant' Russian politician Igor Anaskikh, deputy chairman of the Parliament's Physical Culture, Sport and Youth Policy committee, told Russian news agency Interfax last week that the law will not be applied to visitors during the Games. ""The Olympic Games is a major international event. We need to be as polite and tolerant as possible. That is why a decision has been made not to raise this issue during the Olympics,"" he is quoted as saying. Human Rights Watch has described the anti-gay propaganda law as ""a profoundly discriminatory and dangerous bill that is bound to worsen homophobia in Russia."" The rights group also pointed to an increase in attacks in Russia on members of the LGBT community and gay rights activists as cause for concern.

"(CNN) -- An Egyptian court ordered authorities Tuesday to destroy tunnels between the country and Gaza -- the latest sign of a crackdown on underground smuggling networks. It's unclear what Egyptian authorities will do to comply with the court's decision, but it appears to fall in line with a recent push to put a stop to the tunnels. Egyptian security forces began sending sewage through the tunnels earlier this month as part of a new campaign to flood them, two senior intelligence sources said. The sources, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media, said security forces were using the new tactic as part of a stepped-up effort to stop smuggling. There are hundreds of underground tunnels -- big and small -- in the vast Sinai Desert area. In Gaza, many describe the tunnels as a vital lifeline. Thousands work in what has become a key trade route for the Hamas-controlled territory. In Israel, authorities have accused Hamas of using the tunnels to smuggle missiles and other weapons used in militant attacks. And in Egypt, authorities have blamed the tunnels for violence in the Sinai Peninsula. Tuesday's Cairo administrative court decision requires the Egyptian government to close and demolish what it described as ""illegal secret tunnels,"" the state-run EgyNews agency reported. After a surge of violent attacks in the Sinai Peninsula in August, Egypt's interior minister blamed the tunnels, citing them as smuggling routes for terrorists and weapons. Bulldozers and cranes were sent to block the tunnels on the Egyptian side as Egypt's military leadership accused dozens of militants from terrorist factions in Gaza of carrying out a deadly attack on soldiers near the Rafah border crossing. But smuggling through the tunnels has continued, with goods like cement, sugar and clothes slipping through. U.S. and Israeli officials say that Iran has used the tunnels to send arms and missile parts into Gaza. In December, then-U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called on Egypt to crack down on arms smuggling through the tunnels, saying they were being used to send weapons from Libya and Sudan to militants in Gaza. ""I am concerned that, if more rockets are allowed to enter Gaza through the tunnels, that will pave the way to more fighting again soon,"" she said. In November, one of the most powerful tribal figures in northern Sinai told CNN that it was likely that long-range missiles had been smuggled through the tunnels ""most likely hidden among other merchandise that is loaded onto big trucks that go through the big tunnels."" Ibrahim Menai, who reportedly owns several of the smuggling tunnels that connect Sinai with Gaza, said Bedouin smugglers got weapons from Sudan by sea on small fishing boats and by land through rugged mountain terrain. ""The weapons that are smuggled to Gaza are mostly Grad missiles, anti-aircraft missiles, and recently during the Libyan revolution, advanced shoulder-held anti-tank missiles came through,"" Menai said. In Gaza, the recent Egyptian campaign to flood the tunnels with sewage has sparked concern about rising prices of goods, worries about the crippling of a vital economic element and criticism that the Egyptian government is helping Israel. The tunnels have surged in importance since Israel imposed a blockade on Gaza in 2007 after Hamas seized control of the Palestinian territory. CNN's Tim Lister, Mohamed Fadel Fahmy, Barbara Starr, Diana Magnay and Bryony Jones and journalist Talal Abu Rahm contributed to this report.","Egyptian authorities have been cracking down on Gaza smuggling tunnels .

"(CNN) -- Picture a mansion on an estate that, before the Civil War, was a thriving Southern cotton plantation. Entering the lavish home is a tall, lanky, bearded man wearing a suit and a stovepipe hat. Sound familiar? Next, another man dressed as Abraham Lincoln arrives -- also tall and bearded -- with the same hat. Then a third. And a fourth. Yep, what we have here is an honest-to-goodness convention of Lincoln lookalikes. Photographer T.J. Kirkpatrick documented this annual meeting of the Association of Lincoln Presenters in April. His images remind us how iconic the 16th President of the United States continues to be, 149 years after his assassination. ""It was certainly quirky,"" said Kirkpatrick, who especially enjoyed reactions the Lincolns would get in public by people who weren't part of the group. ""They'd be surprised to see one Lincoln. Then, once they realized there were 20 more of them, it was like, 'Oh my God!' "" The Lincolns were joined by other lookalikes of the same era, including women dressed as first lady Mary Todd Lincoln, complete with petticoats and huge, colorful gowns. After arriving at the mansion at Lansdowne Plantation in Natchez, Mississippi, some of the Lincolns unbuttoned their long suit coats and sat down for dinner. Kirkpatrick photographed the group at the dining room table. ""A lot of the conversation was just them catching up about their kids and grandkids,"" Kirkpatrick said. ""There was this air of history hanging over the conversation because of the setting -- and because of their costumes."" Actually, Kirkpatrick gets paid to photograph the real President of the United States. As a photojournalist with White House credentials, he regularly takes news assignments that put him in the Oval Office just a few feet from President Barack Obama. Kirkpatrick's trip down south was part of a larger project surrounding conventions in general. ""The idea is to look at people sort of gathering around their interests,"" he explained. ""When they come together -- when they kind of join their flock -- I find a certain honesty in those moments. I hope the pictures that I'm making reveal the community they're creating around this particular interest."" Kirkpatrick has photographed plenty of Civil War battle re-enactments. You might say the Lincoln convention is a geekier kind of re-enactment -- for political history buffs. ""By and large they take their roles fairly seriously,"" he said. ""In general, everybody was in their suit and top hat for four days."" That's commitment. In one of Kirkpatrick's favorite images from the shoot, an ""Abe"" steals a kiss from a ""Mary"" outside a hotel ballroom. ""It's a very human moment -- a very honest interaction between husband and wife,"" he said. ""And it happens to be that they're dressed as these historical characters."" The convention came with jarring visual anachronisms. For example, it was impossible to ignore the sight of Abe Lincoln on a cell phone. And two Lincolns using digital cameras to snap photos of each other isn't something you see every day. The convention also provoked stark observations. In fact, the irony of an ex-slave plantation hosting an event honoring the man who freed America's slaves wasn't lost on Kirkpatrick. ""They had a little patch of cotton on the property where people who go on tours can actually pick cotton,"" Kirkpatrick said. Some of the re-enactors decided to try it. ""It was weird seeing a bunch of Lincolns gathered around picking cotton,"" he said. Also during the plantation tour, one conventioneer -- portraying African-American abolitionist leader Frederick Douglass -- commented about the trees in the area. ""I wonder if anyone was ever hung from these branches. These trees could tell some stories,"" Kirkpatrick recalled the man saying. The comment, Kirkpatrick said, ""gave a broader context to this gathering -- that there was so much history that gets ignored or brushed under the table when we see a person portraying Lincoln ... or we go to a Civil War re-enactment. It's a very thin slice of the reality of those people's lives at that time."" ""It wasn't a morbid observation, I think it was a very honest one,"" Kirkpatrick said. ""There's a lot that we don't know, that doesn't get talked about -- certainly from that time period -- that should be. T.J.

"(CNN) -- On July 24, 2008, then-presidential candidate Barack Obama addressed tens of thousands of Germans on the avenue that leads from the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. In a pointed reference to the outgoing administration of President George W. Bush, he promised a new era of ""allies who will listen to each other, who will learn from each other, who will, above all, trust each other."" One German present among the hugely enthusiastic crowd said the occasion reminded him of Berlin's famous ""Love Parade."" No U.S. politician since John F. Kennedy had so captured Europeans' imagination. Five years on, in the words of the song, it's a case of ""After the Love Has Gone."" The U.S. ambassador in Berlin has been summoned to the foreign ministry over reports in Der Spiegel that the U.S. National Security Administration (NSA) monitored Chancellor Angela Merkel's official cellphone. His counterpart in Paris received a similar summons earlier this week after revelations in Le Monde. Merkel says Europe's trust must be repaired after U.S. spying claims . Both Der Spiegel and Le Monde used documents provided by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, lamented a ""grave breach of trust."" One of Chancellor Merkel's closest allies, Defense Minister Thomas de Maiziere told broadcaster ARD there would be consequences. ""We can't simply turn the page,"" he warned. Der Spiegel reported Thursday that Thomas Oppermann, who leads the parliamentary committee that scrutinizes Germany's intelligence services, complained that ""the NSA's monitoring activities have gotten completely out of hand, and take place beyond all democratic controls."" In an article for the forthcoming edition of Foreign Affairs magazine, Henry Farrell and Martha Finnemore argue that it's the disclosure of such practices rather than their existence that is damaging. ""When these deeds turn out to clash with the government's public rhetoric, as they so often do, it becomes harder for U.S. allies to overlook Washington's covert behavior and easier for U.S. adversaries to justify their own,"" they write. ""The U.S. government, its friends, and its foes can no longer plausibly deny the dark side of U.S. foreign policy and will have to address it head-on,"" they argue. Among the Twitterati, #merkelphone has gained some traction, with the famous Obama motif ""Yes We Can"" finding a new interpretation. And the European media has begun to debate whether the revelations provided by Edward Snowden to The Guardian and other newspapers will do to Obama's image on the continent what the Iraq war did to that of President George W. Bush. Hyperbole perhaps, but the Obama administration is on the defensive, caught between fuller disclosure of just what the NSA has been up to and the need to protect intelligence-gathering methods. The president himself received what German officials describe as an angry call from Merkel Wednesday demanding assurances that there is no American eavesdropping on her conversations. The language out of the White House has been less than forthright, with spokesman Jay Carney saying that ""the president assured the chancellor that the United States is not monitoring, and will not monitor, the communications of the chancellor."" His careful avoidance of the past tense has heightened suspicions in Europe that only the Snowden disclosures have forced a change of practice. Even pro-U.S. newspapers like the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung are in full throttle, writing that: ""The government in Washington has apparently not yet understood the level of damage that continues to be caused by the activities of American intelligence agencies in Europe."" Le Monde reported that the NSA collected details of millions of phone calls made in France, and described it indignantly as ""intrusion, on a vast scale, both into the private space of French citizens as well as into the secrets of major national firms."" Mexico to summon U.S. ambassador over spying allegations . French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault commented it was ""incredible that an allied country like the United States at this point goes as far as spying on private communications that have no strategic justification, no justification on the basis of national defense."" The U.S. Director of National Intelligence insisted in a curt statement that ""the allegation that the National Security Agency collected more than 70 million ""recordings of French citizens' telephone data"" is false."" But President Obama called his French counterpart, Francois Hollande, and the White House subsequently acknowledged the allegations had raised ""legitimate questions for our friends and allies."" The fall-out may be more than rhetorical. Germany's opposition Social Democrats are asking whether the European Union can -- or should -- agree a free trade deal with the U.S. in the current atmosphere. Negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership were already in a fragile state and will not be helped by claims in Le Monde that large French corporations such as telecom company Alcatel-Lucent have been targeted by the NSA. The European parliament has always been prickly about data-sharing with the U.S., and for years held up the U.S. Treasury's efforts to use the SWIFT interbank apparatus to keep tabs on terrorists' financial flows. The parliament this week passed a non-binding resolution calling for the agreement that was eventually reached to be suspended. And a parliamentary committee has agreed tough measures that would forbid U.S. companies providing data services in Europe to transfer the information to the U.S. without obtaining permission. The legislation must be agreed with member states, but for those hoping to get the provision deleted the wind is blowing in the wrong direction. Not unlike the WikiLeaks disclosures, reports based on the Snowden documents have caused embarrassment and friction around the world. President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil cancelled a visit to the United States after it was alleged that the NSA had intercepted her messages as well as communications from the state oil company, Petrobras, now one of the biggest players in the oil industry. Spiegel reported the U.S. had also accessed emails to and from former Mexican President Felipe CalderÃ³n while he was still in office. Obama, in his address to the U.N. General Assembly last month, tried to head off the gathering storm - saying: ""We've begun to review the way that we gather intelligence, so that we properly balance the legitimate security concerns of our citizens and allies with the privacy concerns that all people share."" U.S. spy chief says reports of NSA logging French phone calls are false . And there is a hint in the U.S. response this week that, to borrow from Hamlet: ""The lady doth protest too much."" The NSA itself has made the point that ""the United States gathers foreign intelligence of the type gathered by all nations."" The UK and France are among governments that run their own expansive technical programs. Der Spiegel reported -- again based on Snowden's disclosures -- that the British equivalent of the NSA was involved in a cyber-attack against Belgium's state-run telecommunications company, Belgacom. The company would only say that ""the intruder had massive resources, sophisticated means and a steadfast intent to break into our network."" The Europeans have been very grateful to share the benefits of the NSA's immense data-gathering abilities in counter-terrorism and other fields. U.S. diplomatic cables disclosed by WikiLeaks show Germany was enthusiastic in 2009 and 2010 for closer links with the NSA to develop what is known as a High Resolution Optical System (HiROS) -- a highly advanced ""constellation"" of reconnaissance satellites. One cable from the U.S. Embassy in Berlin said: ""Germany anticipates that their emergence as a world leader in overhead reconnaissance will generate interest from the USG and envisions an expansion of the intelligence relationship."" The 9/11 attacks changed espionage beyond recognition, leading to massive investment in the U.S. in ""technical means"" -- the flagship of which is the enormous NSA data center being completed in Bluffdale, Utah. Its computing power, according to the specialist online publication govtech.com is ""equivalent to the capacity of 62 billion iPhone 5s."" But 9/11 also shifted the balance between intelligence-gathering and civil liberties, with the U.S. federal government acquiring new powers in the fight against terrorism -- some sanctioned by Congress but others ill-defined. The technology that allows such enormous data-harvesting cannot be put back in the box, but the limits to its use pose an equally huge challenge. Ultimately, the Europeans need to collaborate with the U.S. on intelligence-gathering, to deal with international terrorism, cyber threats and organized crime. But the Snowden allegations, whether reported accurately or not, have changed the public perception and mood in Europe, obliging leaders like Merkel to take a tougher stand. At least there has been plenty of room for black humor amid the diplomatic back-and-forth. ""Earnest question: What do European leaders talk about that's worth spying on?"" asked Politico's Blake Hounshell on Twitter, while New York Times London bureau chief Steve Erlanger quipped: ""I'm not sure I'd want to listen in to Silvio Berlusconi's cellphone.""","Allegations of surveillance by U.S. on European allies has strained relations .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Gunmen fired on two female health workers administering polio vaccines in northwest Pakistan on Tuesday, killing one and wounding the other. The shooting on the outskirts of Peshawar was the latest in a series of deadly attacks against those giving out the vaccine. Two men on a motorbike opened fire on the two women while they were going house to house in the village of Bedh Der, said local police official Shafi Ullah. One woman died at the scene; the other was critically injured, Ullah said. Why polio hasn't gone away yet . Pakistan is one of three countries in the world where polio has yet to be eradicated. Pakistanis have viewed polio vaccination campaigns with suspicion after the CIA's use of a fake vaccination program in 2011 to collect DNA samples from residents of Osama bin Laden's compound to verify the al Qaeda leader's presence there. Bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces in May 2011. In June, a Taliban commander in northwest Pakistan announced a ban on polio vaccines for children in the region as long as the United States continues its campaign of drone strikes in the region, the Taliban said. Opinion: Drones decimating Taliban in Pakistan . It wasn't immediately clear if the Taliban played a role in Tuesday's attacks. Polio, a highly infectious viral disease that can cause permanent paralysis in a matter of hours, has been eradicated around the world except for three countries where it is endemic: Pakistan, Nigeria and Afghanistan. After the number of cases spiked sharply last year, Pakistan stepped up its eradication efforts. The numbers fell from 173 in 2011 to 58 in 2012, according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. Polio workers come under fresh attack in Pakistan .","Pakistan is one of three countries in the world where polio has yet to be eradicated.

"(CNN) -- My mom was always sports mad -- my dad not so much. But both my parents understood the importance of significant events, so when opportunity knocked, my parents opened up all doors for me. I grew up knowing full well that my country wasn't allowed to participate in international sports following the sporting boycott of 1977 which had been placed on South Africa in a protest against apartheid -- a system of racial segregation enforced by the ruling white minority. So when the South African rugby team toured New Zealand in 1981, my parents made sure that I was awoken at 04:30 to watch all three Test matches. I got to snuggle between my parents -- and a first -- they put the television in their bedroom. It was the ""flour bomb"" Test -- where a light aircraft flew over Auckland's Eden Park before and during the match, dropping flour bombs, smoke bombs and anti-apartheid leaflets -- where I began to realize that other countries didn't like us. I didn't understand why at the time, and it hurt a little. Later that day, I'll never forget my parents telling me that it could be a long time before I witnessed something like this again. I was six at the time. They were right; I would next see these two teams play as a 17-year-old. First trip . My first trip to Cape Town's Newlands Cricket Ground was to watch Western Province play a domestic match. It must have been my mom's first trip too, because I distinctly remember entering the ground and ending up sitting on the grass embankment, which was reserved for colored people. Confused, we sat down. A kind couple offered us some fruit, so we stayed. I was blissfully unaware of how significant this possibly was. We returned a couple of years later to watch my first ""Test"" match: South Africa vs. the West Indies. This time we were seated in the correct place, in the Oaks Enclosure, which ironically these days is a grass embankment. I remember the hype and the excitement about this special day. I had seen the Windies in their warmup game against Western Province and I knew that they were something special. They had vicious fast bowlers and flamboyant batsmen. We got there early, along with thousands of others, just to watch the warmups. The excitement was tangible. I don't remember much about the games -- I remember more about the players. They were heroes to us. Perhaps there was some curiosity too, something about the islanders from far, far away on our shores. We used to follow them around the boundaries of the ground, hunting their prized autographs. And their accents -- just too cool. Didn't see color . I know I didn't see the color. I don't think most kids did -- they were just cricketers. At the end of play we would run on the field to try to touch them and grab one more autograph. Somewhere there is footage of me congratulating Sylvester Clarke by patting his back. I remember telling all my friends that I had touched the great bowler. While I had forgotten about it, listening to Franklyn Stephenson speak reminded me of the time we were trying to get him to drink from some kid's Coke. He obliged and we all simply went crazy. I realize the significance of that event now. Imagine a black guy drinking from the same can? Perhaps our parents would have flipped out, but this wasn't about color to us. Other memories include how obliging and friendly they were. Happy to give autographs and happy to interact positively with the huge crowds. Branded a rebel . It was with incredible interest and fascination that I watched ""Branded a rebel"" -- a CNN World Sport documentary which first screened last year. It gave me greater insight into the players, the tour, West Indies cricket and indeed my home country. And while ""Branded a rebel"" is an appropriate title for the program, it could have just as easily been titled ""Branded Heroes."" That's what they were to us white South Africans, and I think deep down the Windies players felt that too. It's all about what side of the line you were sitting, I guess. On their return home, the West Indian players were shunned by society and some were forced to move abroad to make a living. The poverty and other such ills which befell some of their players really tugged at all of my emotions. I started thinking what we as South Africans could have done for them. Could we have done more? Did we look after them well enough after the fact? It's a difficult one. These men didn't deserve it, no matter what choices they made. Society can be cruel. Strangled by hatred . It eats me up to think what those players endured upon their return. They were strangled by such hatred in their home countries, and yet I wish they somehow knew what they had done for young cricket fans like me. I got to see ""real"" international cricket played at the ""highest"" level. I got to meet new cricketing greats. I got to bowl like Clarke, Collis King and Colin Croft. I got to emulate David Murray's great wicketkeeping skills on Clifton beach, field like Alvin Kallicharan and admire the patience and masterful batting of the great Lawrence Rowe. And something else -- they taught us not to take ourselves too seriously by showing how much one can enjoy themselves on the sports field. Their smiles, I'll never forget their smiles. Each of their names is entrenched in my memory, and of all of those who saw the matches. They became part of my upbringing and that of thousands of South African fans. What I didn't understand at the time, was what it took for those men to actually land on our shores (money aside). They must have been scared -- really scared. I know I would have been. In the interview with Clive Lloyd, longtime captain of the official West Indies team that dominated world cricket for two decades, he said no amount of money would have made him support a racist regime. I would go as far as to say no amount of money would have put my fears at ease to travel to South Africa. Courage . It's not for me to judge, but those men were courageous. In their cricket and in their collective decisions, and I respect that. A few years later, I did wonder how the black West Indian players got to travel using ""white"" transport and stay in ""white"" areas. I remember asking my mom how that worked. She didn't know, but you could see that my political curiosity was growing. I was disappointed that more players didn't take up the opportunity of being interviewed for the documentary. I was intrigued by Stephenson, King and Murray's thoughts, motives and reflective answers. There seemed no real regret, which was fascinating and pleasing for some reason. As for those who declined an interview, their wounds obviously cut deep. Stephenson was just how I remember him. Boisterous, bubbly and always looking on the bright side of life. We got to know him well here, as he returned to play for the Orange Free State. The fact that he still has all his memorabilia means that the tour meant something to him, and that he feels part of change and change of attitudes in South Africa. I don't know if they changed us as a society but I'd like to thing so, even if it was an indescribably fractured and dysfunctional society. And by this I mean that white South Africa packed out every cricket ground to watch black West Indies, went home and made sure that ""The Cosby Show"" was the most watched program on television -- and yet black people were pretty much denied and excluded from everything. Heart bleeds . ""Branded a rebel"" showed balanced reporting. I like the fact that you saw the tour from a South African perspective as well. Great players like Graeme Pollock, Barry Richards and Clive Rice also effectively served life bans for being, well, South African, and the program understood that. I know that, fundamentally, the tour was morally corrupt, but for an innocent nine-year-old devoid of political allegiances and beliefs, it was simply a chance to see the world's best cricketers entertaining us on the world's most beautiful stage. Ultimately, I'd also like to believe that South African cricketers and administrators were trying to show the government the way forward, and that unity through sport was possible.","Sporting ban to campaign against apartheid in South Africa introduced in 1977 .

"Pyongyang, North Korea (CNN) -- The new leader of this isolated country has inaugurated a new veterans' cemetery, on the first of what are expected to be several days of elaborate ceremonies celebrating the 60th anniversary of the conclusion of the Korean War. Several thousand North Koreans, some of them elderly veterans of the conflict, cheered and applauded when Kim Jong Un arrived at the sprawling new cemetery accompanied by uniformed military commanders and civilian officials. Kim did not speak to the audience. Instead, he cut a ribbon at the entrance to the cemetery compound, which is flanked by enormous monuments and statues depicting fierce North Korean soldiers. He departed after making a brief tour of some of the gravestones. Then the crowd, which included men in baggy, dark suits and ties and women dressed in bright puffy gowns, walked with reverence past graves decorated with medals of heroism. A woman named Kim Pu Ok flung herself weeping at the grave of her husband, a man named Chu Yung Hui who died at the age of 74 in 2011. Kim said her husband was a pilot in the Vietnam War. She stood next to her son, who she said was also a pilot. ""There are five pilots in our family,"" Kim said. ""I am very angry at the U.S. imperialist policy against North Korea. That is why all of my family became Korean People's Army pilots -- to conquer the U.S. imperialists."" The North Korean government has invited a large number of foreign journalists to attend the 60th anniversary of the signing of the armistice, which brought an end to the Korean War. Pyongyang describes the war as a decisive North Korean victory over Washington and its South Korean allies. Among the foreign visitors invited to attend this week's anniversary celebrations are several Chinese veterans and at least one former Soviet veteran of the conflict. Also present at Wednesday's event was Thomas Hudner, a veteran U.S. Navy pilot who has been granted permission to return to North Korea to search for the remains of a fallen comrade. Hudner's 60-year quest has been postponed, North Korean authorities say, because of torrential rains in the area where the remains are believed to be buried. Hudner has been invited back to resume his search in September. CNN's Paula Hancocks in Pyongyang contributed to this report.","Kim Jong Un opens new war veterans' cemetery in North Korean capital .

"(TIME.com) -- Peter Salk and Aseefa Zardari never met before today, but they have an odd and very significant thing in common: both of them were inoculated against polio by one of their parents. In the case of Salk, of course, it was his father Jonas, who administered his just-developed vaccine to himself, his lab workers and his family even before it was formally approved and released. Aseefa's inoculator was her mother, the late Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, assassinated in 2007. ""I have a picture of my wife immunizing our daughter 18 years ago,"" said Asif Zardari, the current president and Aseefa's father, at a United Nations gathering Saturday. ""My martyred wife told the world she dreamt of a world in which all children are free of disease."" Father, daughter and Salk had come to the U.N. as part of a new international push to eradicate polio once and for all, and they were hardly alone. Also in attendance were U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon; Afghan President Hamid Karzai; Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan; Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard; U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius; and -- significantly -- Bill Gates, head of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. All of them and others addressed a plenary session of the U.N.'s Economic and Social Council, and all of them had a single promise: by 2015, if not earlier, polio would join smallpox as the only diseases in human history to be finally and fully snuffed out in the wild. TIME.com: Polio's back. Why now? There was an odd-seeming disconnect between the financial and institutional firepower assembled Saturday and the actual, lingering incidence of polio. In 1952, three years before the Salk vaccine was introduced, 52,000 children were paralyzed or killed in the U.S. alone. In 1988, polio was endemic in more than 120 countries, still afflicting an average of 350,000 people -- mostly children -- per year. Today, the disease is endemic in just three countries -- Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria -- and only in isolated pockets at that, an improvement due in no small part to the efforts of Rotary International, whose 34,000 chapters worldwide have spent more than $1.2 billion in the past 24 years to wipe out the disease. So far in 2012, there have been just 88 reported cases, and India, which once had a higher incidence than any country in the world, just celebrated a full polio-free year. In epidemiological terms, that ought to be enough to declare victory -- especially in a world in which 34 million people are infected with HIV and a staggering 225 million have malaria. But numbers can be dangerously misleading, and this is especially the case with polio. For one thing, only about 1 of 200 polio infections actually produce disease symptoms. The other 199 are subclinical, which means patients may have no idea they're infected, even though they can still pass on the virus -- and it's one that's exceedingly easy to pass, especially in the developing world where poor sanitation accelerates transmission. Why polio hasn't gone away yet . In 2003, polio was on the brink of extinction just as it is today, until clerics in northern Nigeria banned the vaccine claiming that it was part of a plot to infect Nigerian youth with HIV. By 2005, polio cases -- nearly all of them the Nigerian strain -- were raging across 16 countries, from Africa through India and into Oceania. ""As long as the polio virus survives,"" said Sebelius in her U.N. remarks, ""there's a risk of resurgence."" Ensuring that it doesn't survive was the announced mission of the gathering, and that mission is being prosecuted in a lot of ways -- starting with money. Gates has committed more than $1 billion to polio vaccination efforts so far and is keeping the funding spigot open as long as necessary. Rotary Chairman Wilford Wilkinson announced another $75 million to add to the group's already huge contribution; Australia pledged another $50 million. Perhaps most important, the Islamic Development Bank has now stepped into the game, pledging $227 million to Pakistan to help close an existing funding gap until the virus is at last eradicated. TIME.com: How a ban on polio puts the entire world at risk . It's Pakistan that is currently ground zero in the polio war, not because it has the greatest number of remaining cases -- though it does -- but because the anti-polio effort has recently been politicized, just as it was in Nigeria nine years ago. In June, the Taliban blocked a planned round of vaccinations for 161,000 children, demanding that U.S. drone strikes in the country be halted first. Western vaccinators have also been newly suspect, ever since the British newspaper the Guardian revealed that CIA operatives involved in the killing of Osama bin Laden used a faux vaccine campaign in Pakistan to obtain DNA from suspected bin Laden family members, in order to determine if he was in the country at all. In July, gunmen attacked polio teams administering vaccines after the prohibition was lifted, critically wounding a Ghanaian doctor. That tragedy hung over the U.N. proceedings. Taliban's vaccine ban may affect 280,000 children . ""This is a matter of health and justice,"" Ban said in his prepared remarks. ""Where there is fighting and insecurity, I appeal to all parties to provide safe access to health workers."" Zardari announced that government forces are mobilizing community leaders ""to understand that the polio vaccine is a blessing."" Gates's remarks were less about geopolitics than about common sense -- fiscal and otherwise. In a conversation with TIME last week, he described a vaccination program that costs even $1 billion per year as ""a heck of a bargain"" since it avoids tens of billions of dollars in downstream treatment costs -- to say nothing of human suffering. ""I'm very focused on impact per dollar,"" he said at the U.N. ""This is one of the smartest allocations of resources the world can make."" TIME.com: The Taliban halts the polio vaccine -- and Pakistan's kids will pay . To help the world make that investment well, he is employing satellite mapping tools to target more precisely where in often off-the-grid places vaccination teams must go. He is also arranging to equip vaccine crates with GPS tracking systems to ensure that vaccines don't wind up lost, discarded or on the black market. Ultimately, he'd like to see the techniques and infrastructure that are built to eradicate polio today put to work against malaria, measles, HIV, cholera and similar global scourges tomorrow. ""We want to leave in place a primary health care system that can be used for other diseases,"" he said. Gates sounded confident that polio could indeed be beaten and in relatively short order -- within just two or three years; Goodluck Jonathan pledged that in Nigeria at least the disease would be finished by 2015, when his term in office expires; and Alan Duncan, the U.K.'s Minister of State for International Development -- representing the world's second largest donor country after the U.S. -- delivered an open scolding to developed nations that have yet to get off their wallets and help pay for the eradication effort. ""We need to understand why some countries are reluctant to contribute,"" he said with pointed emphasis. ""India has shown the world what is possible. Other countries have got to learn from that excellent example."" Bin Laden raid harms Pakistan polio fight . For all the new emphasis and fresh blood being brought to the anti-polio fight, it was the seniors in the crowd who spoke with the most poignancy. Sebelius recalled being a small child during that viral summer of 1952 when so many of her peers were claimed, and then, in 1955, becoming part of what was known as the Polio Pioneers -- the first schoolchildren to step forward and receive the new vaccine. In the waiting area before the event began, an elderly polio survivor moving with the aid of two walking sticks approached Peter Salk to thank him for the work his father had done -- even if it came too late to spare him the disease. In a pre-vaccine world, there was no one to blame for that victim's long-ago infection. But in ways big and small, we'll all be to blame for any infections to come.

"Paris (CNN) -- As Paris wraps up its prêt-à-porter shows for the Autumn-Winter 2014/15 collection, young designers from across the globe are hoping to make it up one more rung of a desperately steep ladder. Tradition, quality materials, creativity and global exposure make Paris the ultimate and most desired platform for young and established designers alike. International buyers and the press tend to stay in the city longer than in New York or London and have time to visit the showrooms and recent platforms that have been created to showcase young designers, such as Designers Apartment, Tranoï or PREMIERE CLASSE. Acknowledging how little help young designers are afforded, several important prizes with varying degrees of funding have been created within the industry, the most recent and most generous being the LVMH Young Fashion Designer Prize and prizes for young fashion school graduates. Others include the ANDAM fashion award, and the International Talent Support awards (ITS). Still, it takes a combination of artistry, an awareness of the business, psychological and physical resilience to survive the challenging obstacle course to Paris. Most of all, say designers, it takes passion. Oriane Leclercq . ""You have to stay passionate,"" said Oriane Leclercq, a young Belgian designer who graduated from the Brussels-based La Cambre school of visual arts in 2010. ""I was ready for the [grueling] lifestyle because school was so difficult that I didn't have a life outside of fashion then either."" Hired 15 months ago by Maison Martin Margiela, the 26-year old said that her selection as a finalist in the International Festival of Fashion and Photography in Hyères helped her budding career immeasurably. With leading fashion companies sponsoring the festival each year, and jury members including designers Raf Simons and Proenza Schouler, and former New York Times fashion journalist Cathy Horyn, Hyères has enormous cachet and ""accelerates the process,"" said Leclercq, who presented a collection in synthetic materials with touches of leopard spots and fringes in 2011. ""But I didn't get here right away—I worked at Lutz, a microstructure in Paris, and then at Balenciaga. It's important to understand how things work, both in smaller structures where you work with financial constraints and you have to manage everything, and then in larger luxury structures where money is not a problem."" What is critical, said Leclercq, is to find work immediately after graduation: . ""It's a field where things move very fast and it gets harder and harder when you don't begin right away."" Thomasine Barnekow . 32-year-old glove maker Thomasine Barnekow is from southern Sweden, studied in the Netherlands and has been based in Paris since 2010, launching her own brand, Thomasine, 18 months ago. Her sculptural gloves in materials such as leather from Icelandic salmon, hand-painted python or stingray have been included in haute couture and prêt-à-porter shows and this is her second year exhibiting independently at the PREMIERE CLASSE salon. At the Design Academy in Eindhoven she specialized in textiles and accessories, and developed the idea of working on gloves. During an internship with a luxury textile house in Paris, she came across a brochure from the federation of glove factories. After writing to every company in the brochure, Barnekow found one that helped her produce her final project at school. In 2007 she was selected as a ""talent"" in the ITS competition, and was introduced to the French glove maker, Agnelle, who commissioned a collection from her just before the financial crisis. Barnekow slowly made her way towards Paris, ""which gives you a feeling of being close to inspiration,"" as well as being in a country with a heritage of glove making where gloves are being rediscovered as an accessory. After creating gloves for various designers, Barnekow decided to strike out on her own. Her strategy is to grow slowly, so for example she manages her own PR for the moment, lending her gloves to young photographers in exchange for photographs. She works mostly with leather from Italy and France and has her gloves made in a factory in Hungary, which will work with small orders. Because she does everything herself, ""from design, book-keeping, production, sales, PR, trade fairs, material research etc. in the end I only have maybe 15% time for design during the whole year. I am lucky that I am both very sociable and was very good at mathematics as a student."" Valentina Brugnatelli . Although Geneva-based jewelry designer Valentina Brugnatelli has been working in luxury fashion since 1990, she launched her own brand in 2012, working in collaboration with two Barcelona-based designers in a collective. She had been thinking about setting up on her own for a while, and had a number of independent clients for whom she made one-off creations, but was so busy that she kept putting it off. While working at Kenzo she met the two designers with whom she set up the collective because ""it's not easy to work alone. We each have our own distinctive brand, but we put our strengths together. We pick a theme and then interpret it in our own way."" Brugnatelli combines semi-precious stones with wood, brass, resin and enamel to make her innovative jewelry, often inspired by nature. With her own brand now, she says she has learned more in two years than during her entire time working for fashion houses. ""You need to have a scope of 360 degrees, you have to control everything—marketing, PR, pricing, all of a sudden you have be an accountant as well."" Salons like PREMIERE CLASSE are a good way to meet people, says Brugnatelli, who will rent a space there for her summer collection. ""They organize parties and you can meet other designers. We can share our struggles with each other, which is reassuring since everyone puts so much passion and love into what they are doing and yet it's easy to have doubts. It's really a psychological and financial rollercoaster. You have to have energy and believe in yourself."" See: The Congo's cult of elegance .

"(CNN) -- If you look at the images of destruction from Colorado, it's not hard to see why officials have called the Waldo Canyon Fire the most destructive in state history. Last week, it was like a monster roaring down a mountainside, swallowing houses whole. And that's not even the biggest blaze at the moment. A fire in Montana's Custer National Forest is raging over 186,800 acres. As many as 13 new large fires were reported Sunday, the National Interagency Fire Center said. In all, 14 states, mostly in the West, are dealing with active fires. Does it seem like wildfires in the United States are getting bigger and badder? It's a question fire expert Max Moritz has been hearing a lot lately. That's because the University of California, Berkeley professor published a report on global fire risks on June 12, just before the massive fires in Colorado ignited. ""In the long run, we found what most fear -- increasing fire activity across large parts of the planet,"" he said. Moritz's study concluded that some areas of the world, including the western United States, ""should brace themselves for more fire."" 4 die fighting Western fire . Nationally, wildfires have scorched about 2.2 million acres this year. That's less than half the number in July of last year. But the gap has been closing rapidly over the last few days, said Ken Frederick, spokesman for the National Interagency Fire Center. He said the United States was on pace to match or go beyond last year's acreage. In some parts of the country, like Colorado, this year is far worse. ""Certainly for a number of people in communities, 2012 is a terrible year,"" Frederick said. ""I don't want to take anything away from that."" Weather conditions played a big role, Frederick said. Snowfall was below average in many Western states and dry conditions helped fuel this year's fires. ""The winter of 2011-2012 really dealt the cards,"" Frederick said. The frequency and length of the fire season for forest fires has increased substantially due to higher temperatures and earlier spring snowmelt, found a 2009 report by the U.S. Global Change Research Program. ""These changes in climate have reduced the availability of moisture, drying out the vegetation that provides the fuel for fires,"" the report said. Climate changes have also contributed to major insect outbreaks, the report said,. About 1.5 million acres in Colorado have been infested by pine beetles, which kill trees and make them fodder for fire. ""I imagine that this is just the opening salvos of what we're going to see this summer, especially if the temperatures stay up,"" said Michael Archer, who writes a newsletter of wildfire news. Moritz listed several factors in what makes wildfires wilder. How fast is the fuel for the fire growing? How flammable can that fuel get? What is going to ignite the fire? While weather is a key contributor, there's debate over whether Western states are victims of climate change. Moritz said the record temperatures and lack of humidity are characteristics of climate change -- hallmarks of what weather models predict we should expect under climate change. Record heat, storms bring despair, 'horror' ""But to say it is climate change? I think most of us are cautious about saying that,"" he said. Some experts blame bad forest management. Others like Archer say firefighting resources are inadequate. Still others say people are affected due to building in fire-prone areas. Moritz says it's probably all of the above. The problem is just complex enough, he said, to lead to misinterpretations. He said the conversation should focus instead on how people can better coexist with fire as they do with other hazards. Americans build in extra precautions for houses in flood plains or on earthquake faults; why not do the same for houses in fire-prone areas, Moritz said. ""This is a really big wake-up call, a very big warning in all the losses we are seeing,"" Moritz said of this year's fires. That warning was particularly stern Tuesday as millions of Americans prepared for the Fourth of July. For many in Western states, the fires will force different sorts of celebrations. ""Everybody is kind of worried,"" Archer said. ""They've seen 32,000 people evacuated. You're going to see a lot of nervous people in the West."" No grilling or sparklers. And no fireworks bursting in air. As temperatures sizzle, fireworks are even more risky . Triple-digit strategies for staying healthy . More than 1.2 million customers lack power amid unrelenting heat .","A recent study finds increasing fire activities across the planet .
Fire-plagued Western states should brace for more in the future, the study says .

"(CNN) -- If you really want to strike a blow for the environment during Earth Day on Tuesday, do yourself and everybody else a favor and stop driving your car in town. Really -- who needs it? This is not a message for you if you're a farmer or live in a rural area, where it's 20 miles to the grocery store and 100 miles to the nearest hospital. You can keep your car; it's a safety thing. But for the rest of you -- those of you living, working and going to school in America's cities and big towns-- it's time to work toward something better. This year's Earth Day theme is green cities, and green cities should have no cars. What does driving get you anyway? Expense: Want to give yourself a 17% raise? Stop driving. The average American spends more money on transportation than food each year. They spend twice as much money on transportation as on health care. Gas ain't cheap, nor are tires, tolls, taxes, insurance, car payments, speeding tickets and parking to keep your car. Traffic: You're late to work, in a foul mood, tired of staring at someone else's bumper. This is the modern American condition in and around cities. And it's getting worse every year. In 1982, the average American spent 16 hours each year stalled in traffic; in 2011 traffic contributed an average of 38 hours of misery per year, costing the nation an estimated $120 billion in lost time and wasted fuel. Noise: Horns honking. Wheels screeching. The grumble of a river of motorcars pouring down the boulevard. Excessive environmental noise is linked to insomnia, stress and deafness. Can you hear me? An estimated 104 million Americans per year are exposed to harmful clamor, most of it derived from traffic. No parking: Studies show that on average 30% of the traffic in cities is the result of people just cruising to find parking. What is a car without a place to park? A two-ton albatross around the neck. Quick death: Cars are killers -- of pedestrians, cyclists and other drivers. In America, the lifetime odds of dying by car are 1 in 112; only cancer, heart and respiratory diseases, and suicide kill more Americans. Slow death: Cars also contribute to cancer and heart and respiratory diseases by spewing pollution, adding heat to the summer-hot city and preventing exercise. You'd feel better and be more productive if you walked or biked your way to work, at least during the nice weather. Wasted time: On the whole, cars are a lousy way to get people around. A busy city street can move about 4,400 people in cars in an hour. The same street could move 52,000(!) people by bus, streetcar or subway in the same time and use less energy in the process. Opinion: As nuclear power dies, solar rises . And I haven't even mentioned the global effects of getting cars out of cities, among them: Reducing carbon pollution would slow climate change and habitat destruction. So how would this work? It would require vision, leadership and collective will. Just imagine how a green city might work without cars. If folks weren't spending their paychecks on the beast, then they might be more willing to support the construction of frequent, clean, attractive, more extensive and cheaper public transportation, a boon for all, especially the elderly and disabled. People might also ride their bikes, or even walk, to work, once the places formerly used to house cars (that is, parking lots and garages) have been replaced with green housing, parks and open spaces for people. Streetcars, buses and light rail could move people around above ground. Subways could be retrofitted to transport freight rather than people by night. Smaller deliveries can go by bike or clean-fuel, golf-cart-like vehicles. How about emergencies? Fire engines, ambulances and other emergency vehicles could still use city streets and would get there all the sooner for having less traffic to wade through. And what about weekends in the country? No problem. Take the trolley up to a city line garage, claim your car and away you go. Just park it there again when you get back.","Eric Sanderson: Earth Day's theme is green cities. How to get there? Get cars out of town .
He says Americans would save substantial money and time by not driving in cities .
He says cars pollute and harm the health of humans and the environment .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Until about four years ago, farmer Zhou Jie and his family had been living in rural Anhui province, growing grain and other staples on a small plot of land. Now they live in the outskirts of Beijing, renting a tiny house owned by a local farmer. In the morning he drives a minivan to drop off his seven-year-old daughter to a migrants' school before he plies his trade selling construction materials. His wife augments the family's income by working in the city as a household maid. The Zhous are among the millions of peasants who have moved away from the land into the cities. They are the new urban dwellers in China and their ranks are growing. At the end of 2011, China counted over 690 million urban dwellers -- or 51.27% of the country's 1.347 billion people -- according to a report this week from the National Bureau of Statistics. That marks an increase of 21 million from the previous year. During the same period the rural population dropped by over 14 million to 656 million. So for the first time, China's urban population now outnumbers the rural population. ""This is one of history's most important population shifts,"" said Aprodicio Laquian, population expert and professor emeritus at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. ""It resembles the 19th century Industrial Revolution in Europe, except that in China it's compacted into only a few decades."" Most Chinese traditionally made a living from subsistence farming. While many still do, their ranks have significantly shrunk. China's rapid economic growth over the past three decades has expanded the size of China's cities and towns. There are now over 160 cities in China with a population of over 1 million, according to China Today. Mega-cities like Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou have served as the engines of this growth, creating jobs and wealth. Lured by the prospect of wages much greater than those available in the countryside, millions of farmers headed for urban areas. They constitute the ""liudong renkou,"" or floating population, that moves in and out of China's urban areas every day, taking up odd jobs in construction sites, public infrastructure projects, restaurants and households. Officials say there are about 200 million of them nationwide. ""They do the heavy, dirty and dangerous jobs that we urbanites are no longer willing to do,"" said Wu Huan, a Beijing resident who works for a government agency. These farmers, also known as ""mingong"" (migrant workers), work in cities but most of them remain as farm residents. It is difficult for them to become legitimate urban residents because of the ""hukou"" system, a centuries-old household registration system which categorizes the population into rural and urban residents. Without an urban hukou permit, they are often denied access to the subsidized health care, housing and education for their children that urbanites enjoy. This hukou system has been a source of controversy among experts who advocate its abolition and city planners who worry about mass migration. Critics of the policy say it causes discrimination against the mingong and exacerbates social tensions between the haves and have-nots. Some rural migrants secure temporary residence certificates but getting them is a cumbersome and expensive process. ""It's almost as difficult as getting a 'green card' in the United States,'"" Wu quipped. But with the aim of sopping up excess rural labor and pushing China's urbanization goal, Chinese authorities have gradually relaxed the enforcement of the regulations. It has yet to officially scrap the hukou system but more cities are now allowing farmers to move in, some temporarily and some permanently. The urbanization movement is changing the face of China, making it more metropolitan and prosperous. ""Urbanization will be the engine to big-scale social changes and provide employment opportunities,"" said Li Peiling, director of the Institute of Sociology at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. ""It will affect people's lifestyle, way of production, occupational structure, consuming habits and value systems."" But it is also bringing problems, such as rising criminality, traffic and housing congestion and social tensions. Just as worrisome, experts say, is the enormous pressure the new urbanites place on the cities' finances and infrastructure. ""The increase of urban population poses a challenge on the distribution of resources,"" said Li Jianmin, a professor at Nankai University's Institute of Population and Development. That is why, he says, megacities like Beijing and Shanghai are trying to limit population growth, even as small and medium-sized cities are encouraging migrant farmers to shift from being rural to urban hukou residents. China hopes to avoid the ""city diseases"" such as mass unemployment, over-crowding, water and power shortages, and slums. Zhu Xiang, a professor at Hunan Normal University, cautions against the emergence of ""a kind of 'over-urbanization' like those in some Latin American countries where the speed of urbanization exceeds that of economic development,"" and the emergence of a ""new poor alongside urbanization, like in many African countries."" Not everyone is impressed with this week's report on the demographic shifts. ""China simply pulled off an urbanization of geographical land mass, not an urbanization of people,"" said Guangmotuan, a Chinese netizen on Sina.com, a Twitter-like micro-blogging site. ""Many of our population still live in medieval peasant state.Their lifestyle and cultural level do not fit modern cities."" Another micro-blogger frets about food. ""If we have more urban residents, more people will lose their farm land,"" wrote Chi Yu, ""With less people tilling the land, in a few years the price of rice will be more expensive than housing.""","In 2011 China counted over 690 million urban dwellers -- 51.27% of its 1.347 billion people .

"(CNN) -- Fireworks boom, bulbs flash, and flames flicker as tens of millions of people across the globe celebrate the beginning of the Festival of Lights. Diwali -- from the word Deepavali, meaning ""row of lights"" -- is observed by Hindu, Sikh and Jain communities, who celebrate for five days in autumn to mark the victory of light over darkness. This year, the festival begins on November 3, with splashes of color, lighting displays and blaring parties set to greet Diwali's arrival. Celebrated for centuries across much of the Indian subcontinent, Diwali is now exploding: spreading the promise of wealth, knowledge and happiness to new communities across the world. From India . For the Diwali newcomer, photographer Roy del Vecchio expertly captures the outsider's inauguration into the festival -- snapping the delighted face of a man who had invited him to join the celebrations on his roof. 39-year-old del Vecchio says he had traveled to Rajasthan to see the festival, when the man holding the sparkler had invited to join him and his sons to light fireworks and share traditional sweets. More CNN Celebrates: Halloween -- Some of you are pretty twisted . Fireworks are said to drive away evil spirits and, at this time of year, many Hindus will also clean the house and light small oil-burning lanterns to attract Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth into the home. But the celebration is anticipated with excitement by many across India -- as well as neighboring Sri Lanka and Nepal -- regardless of religious beliefs. ""I do celebrate Diwali, more for the spirit of the festival, rather than its religious implications,"" says iReporter Samarjit Mazumdar from Bangalore, India. To the World . Mazumdar captured one of Diwali's traditional symbols: a Swastika assembled from marigold flowers, which symbolizes peace, the 32-year-old explains.

"(CNN) -- Takeoff on one of Airbus' new A350WXB test planes is a strangely quiet experience. Powered by two hulking Rolls Royce Trent XWB engines, you'd expect to hear more than just a low whirring noise when tearing down the runway. But when leaving the ground and heading into the clear blue skies of a Hong Kong morning, there was little else to hear on the newest addition to commercial aviation. Compounding the hush was the unique nature of the flight. Most of the select few passengers on board flight AIB 206 to Singapore were from the plane's manufacturer; part of a dedicated team undertaking the final tests to make sure the aircraft is certified to enter service in December with its first customer, Qatar Airways. The flight was part of Airbus's A350XWB ""route proving"" trip, something akin to a world tour where existing and potential customers can take a look at the goods first hand, while the engineers continue to test and tinker. Named MSN005, the aircraft that flew across the South China Sea, the Malaysian peninsula and Sumatra, is one of only two of the fleet of five test planes kitted out with a full cabin, so the flight was a good indication of what's in store for millions of passengers in the coming years. Seating four abreast in the 42-seat business class sections, nine abreast in the two economy cabins, this is the future of long-haul travel as presented by the European plane maker. Gleaming cabin . It's a competitor to Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and new iterations of the 777 and Airbus hope it'll take up a sizeable chunk of the world's expanding fleet of twin-aisle aircraft. At first glance, the gleaming cabin looks simply like a lovely new plane, but dotted throughout are features that Airbus hopes will set it apart from the competition and impress passengers and airlines alike. ""With fiber optics we've integrated the cables for the in-flight entertainment system, moved the control boxes to a panel under the seat and flooring and been able to make the floor flat,"" says Roland Naudy, the Aircraft Interiors Marketing Manager. That could be sweet relief for those who found themselves with an in-flight entertainment box stopping them from stretching out their feet. Seat-back displays in economy are 10.6 inches (26.9 centimeters), which Airbus say will either be powered by Thales or Panasonic, depending on each airline's preference. Tablets and smart phones can be plugged in and powered from the seat backs, something that's becoming a new standard. The LED lighting onboard has a mind-boggling 16.7 million possible color permutations, which not even a 16-hour intercontinental trip could cycle through, while the cabin is pressurized to a height equivalent of 6,000 feet (1,828 meters) instead of a more standard 8,000 feet, which it is claimed reduces the effect of jet lag. While the plane is touted as being extra wide-bodied (hence the XWB), the height of the cabin without central overhead bins is striking (although that might only be an option for first and business class). For those that favor a window seat on flights, but find the curve of the sidewall cramps their sleep, the new plane has one of the flattest in the business, so cricked necks might also be a thing of the past. Another little touch is that the bathroom light that comes on and then dims when the door is opened. Extreme temperature tests . For the most part the plane looks ready to come into service tomorrow, but throughout there are hundreds of sensors relaying information to a flight test station set up in the middle of the rear economy cabin. Two test engineers spent the flight poring over the data, gathering up to 120,000 parameters. Everything, from temperature at certain points in the cabin to the fuel flow, could be relayed live back to Airbus HQ in France. Further route-proving flights to Africa and Australasia are scheduled, and while the flight-worthiness tests have been ongoing for more than a year -- including extreme temperature tests in the Arctic, stalls, and aborted takeoffs at full speed -- fitting out the interior to clients tastes is a long process too. ""We expect that be around 10 months,"" said Didier Nasarre, head of customer program. In fact, he said, it's been closer to 20 months for the first customer as everything needed to be done more or less from scratch. From the height of counters in the galley to the type of carpet, every detail is examined and evaluated by airlines, said Nasarre. The plane is made of 53% composite materials helping its fuel efficiency. The A350's swooped back winglets could make it as recognizable a sight at airports around the world as the crenelated engine covers of the Dreamliner. ""Basically if a plane looks good, it flies well,"" said Henry Craig, a pilot for Cathay Pacific, as he peered out the window at the curvy wing-tips. ""I'm a fan of beautiful things and that is a thing of beauty."" The A350 will come in three sizes, the A350-800, A350-900 and A350-1000, offering between 276 and 369 seats. As of July there were 742 orders from 38 airlines.","CNN's Dean Irvine joins Airbus team on board a A350WXB during a ""route proving"" flight .

"(CNN) -- Henry McCollum and Leon Brown walked out of prison free men Wednesday after DNA evidence implicated someone else in the rape and murder of a North Carolina child some 30 years ago. McCollum, 50, was 19 at the time of his arrest. He was sentenced to death in 1984 and was North Carolina's longest-serving death row inmate. His half-brother, Brown, who is four years younger than McCollum, was initially sentenced to death as well but later had it reduced to life in prison. ""Ain't no anger in my heart. I forgive those people,"" McCollum told reporters, CNN affiliate WRAL reported. ""I don't like what they done to me and my brother because they took 30 years away from me for no reason, but I don't hate them,"" he said. WRAL reported that McCollum left Central Prison, in Raleigh, while Brown left Maury Correctional Institution in Greene County, North Carolina. The siblings were just teenagers when they were arrested in 1983 and charged with the rape and murder of 11-year-old Sabrina Buie in Red Springs, about 30 miles southeast of Fayetteville in rural Robeson County. Buie's body was found in an area of Red Springs known as something of a ""lovers' lane,"" according to Joe Freeman Britt, the district attorney who prosecuted them in the '80s. The ground was littered with ""beer cans, condoms and cigarettes,"" Britt said. It was one of those cigarette butts that ultimately set the men free. DNA found on a cigarette ""matched another individual named Roscoe Artis, a convicted rapist and murderer who lived less than 100 yards from where the victim's body was found,"" said a statement from McCollum's and Brown's attorneys. Artis is serving a life sentence in a North Carolina prison on a separate conviction. It was not immediately clear whether prosecutors would bring charges against him for Buie's murder. CNN's Kevin Conlon and Suzanne Presto contributed to this report.","""Ain't no anger in my heart. I forgive those people,"" says Henry McCollum .

"Your app store may be getting a lot less flappy. Both Apple and Google appear to be cracking down on new apps taking advantage of the demise of ""Flappy Bird,"" the addictively simple casual game that became an unlikely sensation before its creator abruptly pulled it off the market last week. Even before ""Flappy Bird"" topped the download charts last month, a cavalcade of knock-off games began appearing. A quick search for the word ""flappy"" in the Google Play store on Monday returned 250 results, from ""Flappy Pig"" and ""Flappy Fish"" to ""Flappy Troll,"" ""Flappy Cat"" (yes, it's the Web's beloved Nyan Cat) and even ""Flappy Bieber.""

""This is just not my f---ing week: Rejected. 'We found your app name attempts to leverage a popular app',"" Ken Carpenter of Mind Juice Media tweeted Friday. ""Which app?  FB doesn't exist!?!?! Carpenter said he had submitted a game called ""Flappy Dragon."" Several developers responded to his post, saying they had gotten similar notices from Apple and Google. Neither Apple nor Google immediately responded Monday to a request for comment. An Apple spokesperson told tech blog The Verge that the company is cracking down not just on apps with the word ""flappy"" in the title, but all apps that appear to be trying to trick customers into thinking they are associated with or replacing a popular original. One developer told App Battleground that he retitled his popular game ""Flappy Bee"" as ""Jumpy Bee"" several days ago after getting an e-mail from Apple saying he had 48 hours to change the name. After existing in relative obscurity for months, ""Flappy Bird"" took off in popularity late last year and became the most popular free app in both Apple's App Store and Google Play, the store for Android apps. At its height, the game was earning Nguyen an estimated $50,000 a day through advertising, an obvious reason others hoped to piggyback on its success. Nguyen said he was pulling the game, which took him two or three days to create, because it had become an ""addictive product.""  After he pulled it, smartphones with the game already installed began popping up on eBay, with some sellers asking tens of thousands of dollars. While the app is no longer available, Nguyen is still earning money off ads viewed by the millions of people who had already downloaded it.","Developers say Google and Apple are cracking down on ""flappy"" games .

""It can feel like there's a big gap between what other people are experiencing and what you're experiencing."" Add the financial pressure of gift-giving, cold weather and lack of sunlight, and those are prime conditions for a world-class funk. But unlike seasonal affective disorder (SAD), which is estimated to affect up to 20% of Americans, it's unknown how many people suffer from the holiday blahs. DailyBurn: 7 disastrous holiday desserts (and healthier swaps!) ""It's important not to classify all winter doldrums as SAD,"" explains Sarah Eckfeldt, a psychotherapist in New York City. ""Many people experience a drop in mood in anticipation of the holidays because they might be sad over a recent breakup or spending the first holiday after the death of a loved one and could benefit from talking to a therapist."" The good news: Seasonal doldrums tend to fade once the festivities are over (and if they don't, consider seeking professional help). In the meantime, here are some tips to help you improve your mood over the next two weeks: . DailyBurn: 19 ways to trick yourself into becoming a morning person . 1. Seek social support . Meghan Day was seized with sadness earlier this month after decorating her Christmas tree alone. The activity was intended to make her feel better about creating her own holiday traditions; she had separated from her husband a year earlier. ""It all feels really strange and new. It's hard not to get in a down place about being alone this time of year,"" she says. Since the start of the holiday season, she's struggled to get out of bed in the morning and hasn't felt like going out after work. When the blues strike, who wouldn't want to hide at home in yoga pants? Make yourself go out anyway, Eckfeldt advises. ""Hibernation and isolation can feed a depressed mood,"" she says. ""Surround yourself with friends, even if you don't feel like it. Not only are you distracting yourself from your possibly blue thoughts, but being out with others provides you with opportunities for pleasure and joy."" Feeling wary about making small talk? You can skip those parties, she says. Instead, make plans with small groups of friends. Just having a few events on her calendar to look forward to has helped Day feel more connected to those around her. ""It's been good to share how I'm feeling with someone other than my therapist,"" she says. She's also taken the opportunity to explore new things to do that don't involve pricey dinners or drinks. ""Staying out late drinking is exhausting, and not good for my health. It tends to bring me down more than make me feel better,"" she says. On her calendar this month: A Broadway play and a Knicks game. 2. Get to the gym . When Gattsek's holiday blues set in, she found herself skipping workouts with her running group. But foregoing fitness only deprives you of the exercised-induced endorphins that might help boost your mood. The challenge is getting yourself there when you least feel like it. ""Resist any excuse not to go,"" says Eckfeldt. ""Or make a bargain with yourself that you only have to exercise for 10 minutes. Your heart rate will start to rise, and most likely you'll stick it out longer because you're already there."" Better yet, plan a workout with a friend so you're less likely to flake out. Day gravitates to group fitness classes with high-energy music to keep her spirits up. And on days when Gattsek doesn't want to run, she opts for a spinning class or trying out the new yoga studios in her neighborhood. 3. Don't look at Facebook . Even though you know that most people only post their happiest moments on social media, it's easy to lose perspective and get a serious case of FOMO (fear of missing out). ""You can't compare yourself to others' highlight reels of their lives,"" says Melnick, who advocates that less Instagram is more when you're in the dumps. Gattsek believes limiting her consumption of Facebook is helpful during the holidays. ""The second I read something that makes me feel jealous, I shut it off,"" she says. Reach out to your close friends via phone or text message when you feel like connecting with people. You'll get more satisfaction hearing updates from people you actually like, rather than tons of people you haven't seen in years. 4. Reframe your thinking . If you feel isolated, it's important to remember you're still in charge of your life. ""The way to bring more abundance into your life is to give first,"" urges Melnick. ""Find opportunities to volunteer. Meet people. Attend events."" Instead of feeling left out of others' holiday plans, Gattsek says she's started thinking of the break as free time to do whatever she wants -- even if that means spending the day in bed with her cats and Netflix. ""I'm also trying to recognize that it's a challenging time and that it's OK to feel overwhelmed and sad,"" says Day. Finally, it helps tell yourself that the holidays are just a season that will soon pass. In the meantime, Gattsek tells herself she just has to make it to New Year's Eve. ""My holiday blues usually last until the stroke of midnight,"" she says. ""Then I become optimistic about the coming year."" If you struggle with serious and continuous depressive symptoms, be sure to reach out to a healthcare provider to discuss your condition. For additional information on depression, head to the National Institute of Mental Health.","With an emphasis on family and celebration, some people can feel down .

"(CNN) -- When Haile Gebrselassie speaks people listen. The Ethiopian double Olympic gold medalist, who won the 10,000 meter title at four consecutive World Championships between 1993 and 1999, knows talent when he sees it. So when Gebrselassie labeled Nigerian sprinter Obinna Metu ""a bundle of talent who has a very bright future because he is ready to learn,"" people began to sit up and take notice. Most of all Metu himself, who as the fastest sprinter in Nigeria is determined to emulate Gebrselassie's success. ""I want people to be hearing my name, I'd love to be famous,"" Metu told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""I'm thinking of a way to develop my name and sports can help me achieve this. I want to let the whole world know that I exist."" Father figure . Metu and Gebrselassie's paths crossed at the G4S 4Teen Program, which Metu says is ""all about helping the young athletes to develop their talent through financial back-ups."" The pair recently spent time together in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa where they hope to inspire the next generation of athletes. But while hundreds of children watched on in awe it was Metu who was starstruck by Gebrselassie -- a man he describes as a father-like figure. ""Because of his inspirational talks I'm able to withstand the challenges on the track -- he gives me fatherly advice,"" said Metu. ""He has made me understand that to become a great person in track and field or even in sports in general, you have to train your mind to cope with pressure. ""If you cannot handle the pressure then I don't think you can have the qualities to become a champion. ""I could tell that he was able to deal with the pressure and that's why he set so many records. To have him as my mentor is a great thing and will always live in my memory."" Bolt . While most athletes would dream of having just one mentor with the experience and success of Gebrselassie, Metu is in the enviable position of having two -- and the second one isn't too bad either. ""Usain Bolt is lovely,"" Metu said of the world's fastest man. ""He's the kind of person everyone would like to be, to be where he is. ""Because he's generous, he doesn't discriminate, he doesn't really show that he's a champion, he doesn't scare people away from him. ""He always wants people to be close to him. He plays a lot, if you're a champion or if you're not a champion, he recognizes everybody."" Jamaica's Bolt, a six-time Olympic gold medalist, is regarded as one of the finest sprinters in history as well as one of the most charismatic athletes on the circuit. But behind his bravado and confident streak is a man who is desperate to help his fellow competitors, according to Metu. ""Usain made my stay wonderful in Jamaica,"" he said. ""Usain would always say 'Africa, come on, let's go'. He doesn't differentiate. ""He always remembers how he started. He always remembers 'hey, I was once like this guy, so I have to encourage them'. ""He really does encourage people; he encourages young people around him to keep what they know best."" Personal best . Bolt's work with Metu has already reaped dividends with the Nigerian producing a season's best of 10.11 following his time with the Olympic 100 and 200 meter champion. The opportunity to work with sprinters and coaches outside of his own country was important to Metu, who believes the lack of top training partners in Nigeria has hampered his progress. By working in the U.S. alongside some of the biggest names in athletics such as Bolt and Yohan Blake, Metu has gained the kind of experience he could never have gained in Nigeria. ""I think training with these guys teaches you how to manage yourself in the competition,"" he added. ""It helps you realize that you shouldn't fear champions. It makes you recognize that one day I'll be like this guy. ""If you train with a champion then hopefully you'll turn out the same way. That's why it was such a great opportunity when I trained with Usain Bolt."" New challenge . Already a champion in his own country, Metu is desperate to push the boundaries of his success and challenge the Jamaicans and Americans in the big tournaments. Racing against the same athletes within Nigeria no longer holds any appeal nor is it challenging enough -- he's the big fish in the small pond and that has to change. ""I'm the fastest man in Nigeria and everybody's looking up to me -- they want to beat Obinna Metu,"" he said. ""I'm unbeaten in the national trials for the past four years. I still need to do a lot of things to do to become a champion. My mental target is not to win national trials. ""It's no longer any news to me, I don't call it a victory. If I win I don't celebrate that much. ""I'm looking forward to winning a medal at the World Championships or at the Olympic Games. That's what I'm focusing on now."" The opportunity to star at the Olympics began as a far fetched dream. It was during his time at school that Metu decided to pursue sprinting and attempt to follow in the footsteps of his hero, Olusoji Fasuba. Fasuba, an Olympic bronze medalist and a Commonwealth Games silver medalist, provided the inspiration for Metu, who at five years his senior had already become a household name in Nigeria. The two men came face to face at the national Olympic trials in 2008 with Metu defeating Fasuba and taking the title as Nigeria's fastest man following a thrilling 100 meter contest. It was a proud moment for Metu, who also won a bronze medal in the 200 meters at the 2007 World Championships as well as a gold medal at the All African Games in Algeria. Olympic bow . That success ensured he arrived at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing full of confidence -- finishing second in his 100m heat with a time of 10.34 seconds before recording a time of 20.62 in the 200m. Disappointment followed in the 4x100m relay -- a nightmare baton exchange led to disqualification and ended any hopes of medal success. But that failure failed to dent Metu's spirit. Competing at the Olympics in Beijing and then at London four years later remains a proud achievement -- but is by no means the most important of his life. That came when he graduated from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, with a degree in Business Management. ""My greatest achievement is that I'm an international athlete and a graduate,"" he said. ""It's something to boast of, because I don't know about Western countries, but I do know about the African mentality. ""They always see sportsmen as people who don't go to school -- as a nuisance. People used to see sportsmen and women as uneducated, people who wasted their time. ""So I am proud to say, 'OK, I'm able to combine sports and my educational career and combine them successfully'. ""Every year I'm counting my achievements. It's not as if winning national trials is the best achievement in track and field. ""They say that charity begins at home. You have to show that you are good in your own country before showing the rest of the world that you are good."" Family man . Metu's family were certainly proud of him when he won gold medals in both the 100 and 200m at the West African University Games in Ghana. From there he moved on to the very first training camp held by the G4S 4teen Program in Kenya where under the guidance of Gebrselassie he has flourished. His success working alongside the likes of Bolt and Gebrselassie has helped Metu not just blossom as an athlete, but as a person. But there is no doubt in his own mind where the roots of his success stemmed from. ""I'm a product of my family. My family do not regret they have me in this world,"" he said. ""They say 'Ah that's my son'. My mum, brothers and sisters are all proud of me. ""They say, 'Yes Obinna, you're making us proud out there' and that's it. I think it's a great achievement for me."" Perhaps in time he'll make Gebrselassie proud too.","Obinna Metu is Nigeria's fastest man .

"(CNN) -- The world pays attention to Angelina Jolie when she's stepping out with partner Brad Pitt, writing opinion pieces and spurring debate about breast cancer or promoting her latest movie. Now, she's is hoping to turn that spotlight onto Syria's refugee crisis. This week, Jolie -- a special envoy for the U.N.'s refugee agency -- traveled to the world's second-largest refugee camp, where she spoke to Syrian refugees and documented their stories in a video for CNN. Nearly 1.7 million Syrians have fled the country's brutal civil war, many living in densely crowded refugee camps in Syria's neighboring countries. Jordan's Za'atri refugee camp, which Jolie visited to mark Thursday's World Refugee Day, was built to house 20,000 refugees but now has more than 120,000. Their stories of survival and loss are harrowing. Some refugees say they are marrying off their young daughters to protect them from rapists in the camps. CNN inside Syria: Smoldering ruins . One family at the Za'atri camp told Jolie of a mortar that exploded in their Damascus home. At the time of the blast, the couple's 4-year-old son, who suffers from a birth defect and cannot walk, was playing inside. The boy's eardrums were shattered. ""I tried to stay,"" said the mother, Mouna Ahmed. ""I wanted to stay, but after the bombing, it was just too difficult."" She fled with her family, even though she was pregnant. Even in Jordan, when her children hear a plane overhead, they get scared, Ahmed said. Giving a voice to refugees is arguably the most difficult role Jolie accepted when she agreed to become the U.N.'s special envoy for refugees last year. Months after accepting the role, she visited Syrian refugees living in camps in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. Photo blog: Syrian war through children's eyes . As the war drags on in Syria, there has been little talk among world leaders about the humanitarian crisis unfolding as a result of the conflict. Instead, the discussion at the recent G8 conference centered on whether the United States will arm the rebels fighting Bashar al-Assad's regime. Some analysts have warned that Syria's quagmire will trigger the world's worst refugee crisis if it is not addressed. ""This is undoubtedly the world's worst refugee crisis in decades, and if we don't get off this slippery slope, it will soon become the largest in our lifetime,"" Kristalina Georgieva, a humanitarian commissioner for the European Commission, told the Daily Telegraph this week. ""It is so disappointing to see the international community sleepwalking into this disaster."" Gallery: More than a million fleeing . Every 14 seconds, another Syrian is displaced across national boundaries, according to the U.N. Last week, the U.N. made its largest appeal ever -- for more than $5 billion -- for relief aid to Syrians across the country. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs predicted that nearly half of Syria's population will either have fled the country or need aid by the end of the year. One woman at the Za'atri camp told Jolie how her life was transformed when her neighbor in Syria showed up at her door, missing a foot. ""I went to the pharmacist, and I said, 'Hypothetically speaking, if my son or husband had this injury, what should I do?' "" the woman, Umm Mohammed, recalled. With a proud smile, she said, ""He taught me how to sterilize the wound ... and I started working."" Her smile disappears when the conversation turns to her own situation at the refugee camp. Umm Mohammed wants to return to her home in Syria, but the safety of her family keeps her away. There have been promises to help from the international community to end the conflict in Syria, but the reality is that nothing changes, she said. ""Why is no one standing by the Syrian people?"" she asked Jolie. ""No one is helping us. They all say they want to support us, but nothing is being done. They have conferences and make statements, but it is worth nothing.""

"Agadir, Morocco (CNN) -- In Agadir, the arid heartland of Morocco's indigenous Berber population, a quiet oil boom is gaining momentum, one drop at a time. Argan oil, crushed from the seeds of the short, spiky argan tree, has been used for centuries as a medicine and staple ingredient in local cooking -- drizzled on salads and couscous or mixed with almonds and honey to make amlou, a dip for bread. But now the oil is generating buzz as a high-end commodity in the lucrative global cosmetics market. Rich in vitamin E and essential fatty acids, it's believed to help all sorts of skin conditions -- including acne, psoriasis and age-related wrinkles. Argan trees, which are well adapted to drought and other extreme weather conditions, are endemic to the southwestern part of Morocco around Agadir. As such, the rise in demand has turned Agadir -- famed for its beautiful beaches and laid-back culture -- into a hive of small-scale worker co-ops, each dedicated to squeezing oil from the notoriously hard-shelled argan nut. Traditionally, it was uncommon for Berber women to work outside the home. But times have changed, and according to the Argan Oil Society, all the co-operatives are now staffed and run by local women. ""When we started in '96 we had got only 16 women who believed in our project. Most of them were divorced or without a husband,"" said Zoubida Charrouf, a university professor who helped found one of the first cooperatives in the region. Ethnic Berbers -- the indigenous inhabitants of North Africa whose culture predominated in the region prior to the 7th century Arab invasion -- were among Morocco's earliest inhabitants, and government figures show that at least one third of the country's population of 32 million speak a Berber dialect. However, according to the U.N. Refugee Agency, Morocco's Berbers also face habitual cultural discrimination. It was only last year that the state finally recognized Tamazight, the Berber language, as an official language alongside Arabic. Charrouf says that the new-found international popularity of argan oil -- which she describes as ""liquid gold"" -- has not only provided about 5,000 jobs for Berber women across 170 co-ops, but also an important social lifeline. ""We've started relying on ourselves,"" said Ichou Aisha, a co-op worker. ""Now, we can provide for our children on our own."" Argan oil hasn't just improved the region's economic and social standing, Charrouf says it's played a vital role sustaining its ecology too. ""The purpose of this work is to preserve the argan tree, because it was in decline,"" she said. Indeed, 30 years ago, extensive deforestation left the tree on the brink of extinction. Today, UNESCO has designated the 26,000 square-kilometer Argan-growing region as a ""biosphere reserve."" Besides the Argan tree's various human uses, UNESCO notes, it has had an historical role as a buffer against northern expansion of the Sahara desert. Charrouf says it's for all these reasons that 60,000 new trees are now planted each year. The co-op women certainly have their work cut out. It takes about 20 hours to produce just one liter by hand. First they use jagged stones to crack the shells. They then place the kernels between two rocks, grinding them into a brown, peanut butter-like paste. This is then kneaded to extract the oil, leaving a solid block that is sent off to a mechanical press where even more oil can be extracted. To match the pace of global demand, however, many of these processes have become mechanized. But as yet, there is no machine that can do a better job at cracking open the argan nuts than the women. For now at least, the work is steady. ""I am very happy,"" said Charrouf. ""Economically, (because) the price is increasing; socially, because the women can get outside the house and learn; and environmentally, because we can plant these trees.""

"CNN -- At first, no one seemed to notice the young man who walked into the hotel lobby at around 7:45 that Friday morning. Boys (whose faces are blurred out in this photo) attend a ""summer camp"" sponsored by Hamas. He wore a baseball cap, a backpack and dragged a wheeled suitcase behind him. He casually checked his watch as he calmly walked toward a hotel restaurant filled with Western business executives. A hotel security camera caught what happened next. In a matter of moments, the lobby was engulfed in billowing white smoke and flying debris. Another suspected suicide bomber had left his bloody mark. The bombing at the JW Marriott Hotel and the adjacent Ritz-Carlton in Jakarta, Indonesia, on July 17 killed nine people, including the presumed bombers. Investigators are looking at a link between the attacks and a Muslim terrorist group fighting a ""holy war"" against the West. Terrorism is not confined to any faith or any culture. Terrorists are driven by varying impulses. Yet since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on America, terrorism has often been associated with young Muslim men.  Watch as CNN's Christiane Amanpour investigates how one madrassa student is recruited to join the Taliban » . People often assume that Muslim youth who turn to violence are ill-educated fanatics inspired by visions of meeting virgins in paradise. But that portrait is rarely true, terror experts say. ""They are not crazy people,"" says James Jones, author of ""Blood That Cries Out From the Earth,"" a book that examines the psychology of religious terrorism. ""They [terrorist groups] won't recruit psychotic people,"" Jones says. ""Crazy people are unstable. That's exactly what you don't want."" Then who are these Muslim men and women who turn to violence? Terror experts say they are shaped by several common factors. They see no way up or out . Fathali M. Moghaddam, director of the conflict resolution program at Georgetown University in Washington, says some Muslim youth may embrace violent causes because they believe they have no chance for upward mobility in their country. ""Imagine if you're a 20-year-old and you want to get on in Egypt or Saudi Arabia,"" Moghaddam says. ""You better be connected by family or know somebody important."" Many don't view politics as a plausible vehicle for social change, Moghaddam says. Their countries are often run by dictators who crush secular opposition groups -- with the tacit support of the U .S. government, these youth believe, Moghaddam says. The only opposition groups that these Middle East dictators dare not attack are those based in the mosque, Moghaddam says. Those mosque-based groups, though, tend to be open to the influence of fundamentalists. ""There's no opportunity for voice, no opportunity to express yourself,"" Moghaddam says. ""Politics is out of the question for the secular opposition -- you're either dead or go to jail."" Politics, though, is part of the answer for Hamas, an Islamic fundamentalist group that rules Gaza. The group, which has admitted responsibility for attacks against Israel soldiers and civilians, won a landslide victory in the 2006 Palestinian legislative election.  Watch a young man who chooses to join the Hamas militia » . ""Some young people are inevitably attracted to the more risky positions and actions taken by a group such as Hamas because Hamas is critical of corrupt and inept dictators in the Arab world,"" Moghaddam says. ""This resonates with Arab youth."" They're driven by a sense of humiliation . Some Muslim youth may turn to violence for another reason: revenge. Basel Saleh, an assistant economics professor at Radford University in Virginia, recently studied the socioeconomic factors that helped shape 82 Palestinian suicide bombers and 240 militants. He says he knows those factors firsthand. Saleh's father's village was razed by the Israelis in 1948 and is now an Israeli settlement. He says he grew up in the West Bank where he once considered using violence to vent his anger after a group of Israeli soldiers came to his family's home unannounced and interrogated him while his younger sister cried. ""But I was on the verge of getting there,"" he says. ""I almost crossed that line."" Most Palestinian youth who did cross that line weren't driven by religion, Saleh says. ""Many weren't motivated by Islamic fundamentalism,"" Saleh says of the Palestinian militants in his study. ""They were motivated primarily by personal grievances. They had been arrested, shot or seen family arrested."" Saleh says some Palestinian youth who believe Israeli soldiers have mistreated their family members may feel duty-bound to retaliate with violence. Protecting one's family against humiliation is important in Middle Eastern culture, he says. ""If anything is done to your family, it's personal,"" Saleh says. ""It has to do with the honor of the family. Family is everything in the Middle East. Your honor is defined by your family."" Saleh says if Israel did more to help improve Palestinians' living conditions, fewer Palestinian youths would turn to violence. ""You have to open a new path for them [Palestinians],"" he says. ""They want freedom of movement. Give them an airport, a port. Don't demolish their schools and their universities. Pay attention to basic human rights."" The anger felt by some Palestinian youth is also stoked by propaganda, says Michael Jacobson, a senior fellow in The Washington Institute's Stein Program on Counterterrorism and Intelligence. Hamas sponsors children television shows and summer camps that are designed to indoctrinate Palestinian children with the same message, Jacobson says.  Watch Amanpour go inside a Hamas boys summer camp » . ""From an early age, they're taught that fighting the jihad against Israel and being a martyr are great things to be,"" says Jacobson, author of ""The West at War: U.S. and European Counterterrorism Efforts Post-September 11."" Other extremist groups use another medium, the Internet, to radicalize Muslim youth, says Jones, author of ""Blood That Cries Out From the Earth."" Muslim youth who spend time on the Internet are exposed to sophisticated videos from terrorist groups showing Muslims being killed in places such as the West Bank, Iraq and Chechnya, Jones says. The sophisticated videos tell the life stories of young Muslims who have volunteered to be martyrs, Jones says. ""There's this constant message that Islam is under attack,"" Jones says. ""Your brothers and sisters are being killed. It's your duty to do something for them."" They're driven by a need to join a cause . Jones says the appeal of terrorist groups taps into an even deeper yearning in many youth, no matter their religion or culture: the desire to give one's self to a transcendent cause. Jones, who joined civil rights demonstrations in the South during the 1960s, says he knows how exhilarating it can be for young people to join a cause that they believe demands some form of sacrifice. Any effort to turn Muslim youth away from violent groups must make a similar appeal, and come from fellow Muslims, Jones says. ""We need something that has an equal amount of passion and moral seriousness that makes them believe they are making the world better,"" he says. ""We need something with those elements but something that's more constructive than blowing yourself up.""","Most assumptions about young Muslim terrorists are wrong, experts say .

"(CNN) -- Murder charges were filed Tuesday against a man accused of killing the pregnant wife of a Marine in California. Erin Corwin, 19 and three months pregnant, had been missing since June 28 after she said she was going to Joshua Tree National Park to scout trails. Over the weekend, searchers found her body about 140 feet down a mine shaft. Her former neighbor, Christopher Lee, 24, was arrested Sunday in Alaska. He is awaiting extradition to California. He faces a murder charge and the special circumstance allegation of ""lying in wait,"" which means he could face life in prison without parole or death, if found guilty, according to San Bernardino County District Attorney Michael Ramos. ""The decision regarding which penalty will be sought will be made after a full review of the facts and evidence in the case,"" he said. Lee had been a suspect from the beginning. Corwin didn't go to Joshua Tree National Park on the day she disappeared, police said in a statement of probable cause written in July. Instead her car was found a few miles from where she lived next door to Lee and his wife, Nicole. Detectives found footprints next to Corwin's abandoned car that led to tire tracks. Investigators said those tire tracks were the same width and same width apart as the tires on Lee's Jeep. According to the court document, several people, including a friend of Erin Corwin's in Tennessee, told investigators that Corwin and Lee were having an affair. He admitted to kissing her but told detectives the two had never had sexual intercourse. Lee also told police that on the day Corwin disappeared he had gone hunting. More than 100 mine shafts were searched before a sheriff's team found Corwin's body. Authorities used cell phone information to narrow the search area to 300 square miles. The area included remote land belonging to the federal government's Bureau of Land Management.","Christopher Lee, 24, was arrested in Alaska, is facing extradition to California .

"(CNN) -- Rocio Moreno says it took more than five years to leave her abusive husband. Throughout their marriage, she says, she endured unwanted sexual advances. If she challenged his orders over where and with whom she spent her free time, she says he responded with verbal and physical abuse. She finally decided enough was enough the day he hit her in front of their son. ""When he hit me I realized he could kill me"" she said. ""I decided no more violence. I didn't want my son to see him treat me that way."" She left him two years ago and moved into her own place. She mostly kept the ordeal to herself until she found the courage to express herself in the Monument Quilt, a collection of hundreds of survival stories touring the country this summer. Her words in Spanish are etched into a 4-foot red square that shares space with others' stories in a 16-foot square. When laid out in full, the squares of 250 stories of surviving rape and abuse stretch out to a 100-foot multicolored square. ""You told me that you loved me but now I know and I understand that I was raped,"" she says. ""I was your wife, not your property."" The brainchild of Baltimore-based activist group ""Force: Upsetting Rape Culture,"" the Monument Quilt project is making 13 stops in 12 states, displaying portions of the quilt in public spaces and growing its footprint through quilt-making workshops. The goal of the project is to create healing spaces by and for survivors, said Rebecca Nagle, co-founder of Force. The quilt evolved from discussions about how to create a permanent monument to survivors of rape, similar to memorials for war veterans, based on research showing how public monuments can help survivors recover from trauma, she said. Quilting has a long history connected to social justice movements, perhaps most notably through the AIDS Memorial Quilt, which began touring the country in 1988 in remembrance of those who succumbed to the disease. Nagle hopes bearing witness to the quilt will help erode stigma attached to rape, similar to the effect the AIDS quilt had on raising awareness around the disease. ""When we remove the stigma from rape and we're able to have public conversations and not blame the survivor, it's one step closer to curbing the epidemic."" The presence of the quilt transforms parks, sports fields and town squares into reverential spaces for grieving and reflecting, said Karen Taylor, a Baltimore social worker who volunteers for Force. ""It creates a community holding space instead of the burden of trauma being on the shoulders of each individual supporter or survivor,"" Taylor said. ""It can be solidifying and reassuring. It can be lifting. It's not just on you anymore."" Part of the healing comes from the collective impact of bearing witness to hundreds of survival stories. It also comes from creating the squares, some of which starts in workshops weeks before the Monument Quilt comes to town. Force partnered with community-based prevention and public safety organizations, who made the quilt workshops part of their community outreach. South Dakota's White Buffalo Calf Women Society hosted workshops two weeks in advance of the quilt's arrival in White River, where it was displayed at a local high school. Quilting is a cultural tradition of the Sioux tribe that inhabits the region, making it an ideal project for the community the shelter serves. ""It gave them a voice without putting them in the spotlight and I think that in itself was very powerful, and a good way to start the healing process,"" education outreach coordinator Summer Lunderman said. ""To stand in solidarity not only with our relatives here but with women in the U.S. was also very empowering for them and let them know they're not alone."" Helping others with their squares brought up memories of Lunderman's experience being molested as a child. Her square reads, ""Lakota Women Are Sacred."" ""It created a safe space for me that I really needed."" Witnessing the quilt inspired Baltimore activist Melanie Keller to bring to the surface her own history of being raped. Keller helped organize workshops through her work with anti-street harassment organization ""Hollaback! BMore."" But she has never publicly identified herself as a rape survivor. Too often stories of sexual harassment in the media focus on stranger danger, date rape or the experiences of white middle-class college students, she said. Seeing the diversity of experiences represented in the quilt inspired Keller, who is biracial, to make her own square. ""What I love about the whole project is the narrative of control by survivors,"" she said. ""It speaks to the diversity of different experiences who have gone through abuse and rape because we're the ones sharing those stories in the way we choose."" Moreno says creating her square was cathartic. She hopes sharing her story will inspire others to ""free"" themselves of a despair she knows firsthand. ""Reading these words tells you yes, there is an opportunity to break the cycle of violence,"" she said. ""It doesn't have to be like this.""","The Monument Quilt consists of more than 250 stories from survivors of rape and abuse .

"(CNN) -- Over the past year we've heard a lot about class warfare, the ""Buffett Rule"" and the tax code and so on. But if you want to see a blatant form of poor vs. rich, walk into a grocery store. Here we are forced to decide between what's good for our kids and what we can afford to feed them. Ground beef that is 80/20 is fattier but cheaper than 90/10. Ground turkey breast is leaner than the other two but is usually the more expensive. And many of us can't even begin to think about free-range chicken and organic produce -- food without pesticides and antibiotics that'll cost you a second mortgage in no time at all. Recently Michelle Obama's campaign to get healthier foods into poor neighborhoods came under new scrutiny because two studies found her notion of ""food deserts"" -- poor urban neighborhoods where access to fresh fruits and vegetables are supposedly nonexistent -- doesn't quite jibe with the research. The studies have even found that there isn't a relationship between the type of food offered in neighborhoods and obesity among the children living there. That may be true. But it is also true that The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition recently published a study that found $1 could buy 1,200 calories of potato chips but just 250 calories of vegetables and 170 calories of fresh fruit. And it is also true that Mississippi, the poorest state in the country, is also the fattest. In fact, the five poorest states are also among the 10 fattest, and eight of the 10 poorest states are also among the 10 with the lowest life expectancy. I guess one could dismiss this as one big coincidence, but is it also a coincidence that half of the top 10 states with the highest median incomes are also in the top 10 in life expectancy? Eatocracy: Buying food is a political act . I don't know about ""food deserts,"" but I do know just as there is a link between education and poverty, there appears to be a correlation between poverty and health. In 2010, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated the weekly grocery bill for a family of four hovered at $134.50; in 2011 it was up to $141.20. That $7 difference may not seem like a lot to some, but I remember my earlier days, when my family of five didn't have $7. And when we did get it, it was used for the cheapest food available -- the fattest meats and dishes anchored by saturated fats and sugars. In other words the kind of diet that's routinely linked to obesity and its byproducts: heart disease, diabetes and high cholesterol. Think it's not your problem? Think again. In 2008, health care costs stemming from obesity were estimated to be $147 billion. By 2030, 42% of Americans are projected to be obese, with costs for health care at $550 billion. One in three adults making $15,000 or less is obese. What happens when they're rushed to the hospital and can't pay their bill? The government pays for it. And by government, I mean taxpayers. Today, hospitals are left with up to $49 billion in unpaid bills, and the government -- or rather we -- pick up 75% of that tab. We have fought over Planned Parenthood's $363 million budget. We've squabbled over NPR's $445 million budget. We have even seen the General Services Administration's $1 million party in Las Vegas become a campaign issue. But nary a word on the campaign trail about the billions that are being spent each year due to this low income-obesity cycle that is not only potentially cutting short the lives of millions of poor Americans, but eating away at the paychecks of a middle class that needs that money to make healthier food choices for their own families. It's a vicious cycle that has a tangible, long-term impact on our economy. The first lady was accused by Republicans of politicizing the healthy food conversation. I wish the topic were politicized -- maybe then Washington would talk about it more. President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act was characterized by many as ""socialized medicine."" Well, why aren't those same critics leading the charge against the nation's expanding waistline, seeing as how taxpayers pay the price when the cost comes due? Instead, we're debating whether or not Obama's a foreigner and legalizing pot. Overheard on CNN.com: Do Americans take enough personal responsibility? The rise of Type 2 diabetes in children coincides with the rise of child obesity and childhood poverty. I'm sure to some that is just another coincidence. But to me that is as strong of an example as any of class warfare and what ails our economy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson says it's expensive to eat healthier food such as pricey organics .

"(Architectural Digest) -- The great American graphic designer Milton Glaser once declared, ""There are three responses to a piece of design—yes, no, and wow! Wow is the one to aim for."" Tommy and Dee Hilfiger apparently endorse that notion. The fashion mogul and his wife have planted their flag on a glorious stretch of beachfront just north of Miami with a home defined by spectacular moments, whimsical flourishes, and astonishing coups de théâtre. In this case wow! might be an understatement. ""We're here for the weather, the Latin flavor, the art, and the palm trees. Most of all we're here for the fun,"" says Tommy. The residence also provides a base near his latest business venture. Hilfiger, who sold his fashion label several years ago but remains its principal designer, recently purchased the Raleigh hotel in Miami Beach, and he plans to refurbish the Art Deco gem starting in 2015. But first he and Dee had their own renovation project to tackle. The house they settled on was a 2007 modern structure, offering some 14,000 square feet. Size was crucial, as the couple coveted space for works from their extensive art collection that had long been held in storage. Architectural Digest: Isaac Mizrahi's Jaw-Dropping Greenwich Village home . ""Our Connecticut home feels very country, with lots of taxidermy, and our place in Mustique has a more British Colonial vibe. We wanted to be able to showcase the colorful large-scale artworks that didn't make sense elsewhere, conceptually or size-wise,"" Dee explains, referring to their trove of Pop and post-Pop treasures by Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, Damien Hirst, Tracey Emin, and others. To realize the energetic, art-friendly abode they imagined, the couple turned to Los Angeles interior designer Martyn Lawrence Bullard. Having admired his facility with bold gestures and integrating major art into domestic settings—specifically, his work at the L.A. residence of Elton John and David Furnish—the Hilfigers enlisted Bullard to help conjure a home attuned to the rhythms and colors of Miami. Architectural Digest: A Modernist Dream House in Southern California . ""Tommy and Dee obviously have an incredible sense of fashion, so my job was to translate their vision into interior spaces that feel vibrant and compelling,"" says Bullard. ""Together, we conceived the house as part art gallery and part 1960s--'70s disco madness."" The designer started by replacing ubiquitous dark-wood paneling and expanses of travertine with clean white walls and new flooring of white-glass tiles to cultivate a pristine aura. For graphic contrast he reclad the central staircase in black marble—a strategy reiterated in the black and white stripes on the kitchen floor. Once the backdrop was set, it was off to the races. Architectural Digest: Bette Midler's Incredible Penthouse . ""I told Martyn, 'If it's not shagadelic or groovy, it's not coming into the house,'"" Dee recounts, describing her criteria for furniture and finishes. True to form, Bullard obliged with a kaleidoscopic array of colors, materials, and furnishings, all deployed in vignettes that scream glamour and sex appeal. The heart of the home is the voluminous living room, presided over by a monumental collaborative painting by Warhol and Basquiat. Ignoring stale precepts that dictate the isolation of art from decor, Bullard extrapolated the painting's vivid hues in an orgiastic hair-on-hide carpet featuring lavish swirls. He also commissioned reeditions of classic sofas by Vladimir Kagan and side tables by Willy Rizzo to inhabit the space. See more photos of the Hilfiger's home on ArchDigest.com .

"London (CNN) -- Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate are expecting their first child after 19 months of marriage, the palace announced Monday. But until 2011, any daughter born to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would not have enjoyed an equal right to inherit the British throne. Rules dating back centuries decree that the crown passes to the eldest son and is only bestowed on a daughter when there are no sons. All this changed at an October 2011 meeting of the leaders of 16 Commonwealth countries in Perth, Australia, where they unanimously agreed to amend the succession rules. CNN examines the background to a controversial and long-running debate. Latest: William and Catherine expecting royal child . What prompted the change? The issue has been discussed in the UK for many years -- and changes have been proposed before -- but it requires an act of parliament and the agreement of the 15 other realms where British royalty is the head of state to alter the rules of succession. Successive UK governments have failed to find parliamentary time to debate proposals to change the law. A spokesman at UK Prime Minister David Cameron's office said it had often been thought of as ""too thorny and complicated to deal with quickly."" The marriage of William and Catherine in April 2011 brought the issue back into focus. David Cameron referred directly to the couple in his speech to Commonwealth leaders, saying the succession rules were ""outdated."" ""The idea that a younger son should become monarch instead of an elder daughter simply because he's a man... this way of thinking is at odds with the modern countries that we've all become,"" he said. White House to royal couple: Congrats! So what was agreed? The leaders of the 16 Commonwealth countries that have Queen Elizabeth II as head of state unanimously agreed that sons and daughters of British monarchs will have an equal right to the throne. They also agreed that a future British monarch can marry a Roman Catholic -- something that is currently banned. What was the historical basis for the old rules? The tradition of favoring the male heir -- called male primogeniture -- goes back many centuries and can be seen in the extensive family tree of the British monarchy. But a key law which governs the way British monarchs are chosen is the 1701 Act of Settlement which has its roots in the religious strife of the age. The official British Monarchy website explains that the act was designed to secure the protestant succession to the throne. Royal commentator and former editor of the International Who's Who, Richard Fitzwilliams, explained that this has been a divisive issue ever since the English Tudor King Henry VIII split with the Catholic Church in Rome in the 16th Century, leading to decades of religious persecution. The Act of Settlement decreed that no Roman Catholic or anyone married to a Catholic could hold the English crown. This is now to be amended so that an heir to the throne can still be monarch even if they marry a Catholic. The British Monarchy website gives two examples of the current royal family who were removed from the line of succession because they married Roman Catholics -- George Windsor, Earl of St Andrews, and Prince Michael of Kent. How are William and Catherine affected? The changes mean that if the couple's first born is a girl, she will eventually become queen. Previously, a younger son would have taken precedence. However, this could be many years in the future. Prince Charles is first in line to the throne when Queen Elizabeth II dies, and his son William would ascend after his reign. David Cameron's speech makes it clear that the new rules are not retroactive, so Prince Charles's eldest sibling, Anne, will not be in line to the throne in front of her younger brothers Andrew and Edward. It also means that any heir born to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge can marry a Catholic and retain the crown. What isn't changing? The British sovereign is also head of the Church of England -- part of the Anglican church -- and retains the title Defender of the Faith. David Cameron said at the 2011 meeting that ""the monarch must be in communion with the Church of England because he or she is the head of that church."" This would currently bar a Catholic holding the crown. Prince Charles caused controversy in 1994 when he said in a TV interview that he would rather be seen as ""defender of faiths"" to include Catholic subjects of the sovereign which he described as ""equally as important as the Anglican ones or the protestant ones."" He went on to list other faiths as also being equally important. What happens next? David Cameron explained in his speech to Commonwealth leaders that ""for historic reasons"" the UK legislation needed to be published first but the necessary measures would be implemented at the same time across the Commonwealth. However, the process is a complex one. The Downing Street spokesman said that in addition to the Act of Settlement, many other archaic laws would have to be amended -- these include the Bill of Rights 1689, the Coronation Oath Act 1688, the Acts of Union and the Royal Marriage Act 1772. Each of the 15 other Commonwealth members would then have to amend their own legislation. So which countries are affected? The Commonwealth consists of 54 independent states, most of which have ties to the United Kingdom, but Queen Elizabeth II is head of state to only 16 of them including the UK. Those nations are Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Canada, Grenada, Jamaica, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu.","The marriage of William and Catherine brought the succession back into focus .

"(CNN) -- A Florida court has vacated the murder conviction of former FBI agent John Connolly, the informant handler of convicted Boston mob boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger, according to court documents. Citing a statute of limitations issue, the Florida Court of Appeals reversed the 2008 second-degree murder conviction for Connolly's alleged role in the 1982 death of a Florida businessman. In 2005 Connolly was charged with first-degree premeditated murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. During his 2008 trial, prosecutors presented evidence that in 1982, Connolly, then an FBI agent, schemed with Bulger and the Winter Hill gang to kill businessman John Callahan. It was revealed in court that Connolly, Bulger and associates met over several weeks before the slaying, but it was ""undisputed"" that hit man James Martorano, and not Connolly, fired the murder weapon. The jury convicted Connolly of second-degree murder with a firearm, a lesser included offense of first-degree murder. The Florida Court of Appeals on Wednesday determined that prosecutors had incorrectly requested that the jury be allowed to convict on second-degree murder with a weapon, instead of first-degree murder, because Connolly's gun was not used in the crime. This allowance, the court said, subsequently reclassified and elevated Connolly's conviction to a crime with a potential life sentence without a statute of limitation. Connolly was sentenced to 40 years in prison in 2009. In the 2-1 decision, the court reasoned, ""without the fundamentally erroneous reclassification"" of this murder charge to second-degree murder with a weapon, Connolly's conviction would have been barred by the applicable four-year statute of limitations. The court vacated the conviction and remanded the case to the trial court, ordering that Connolly be discharged, adding that the ""discharge shall be stayed until any and all post-appeal motions are final. The U.S. attorney's office in Boston expressed disappointment about the ruling. ""Today a Florida appeals court, in a split decision, reversed itself after unanimously affirming John Connolly's murder conviction three years ago. The decision is surprising and disheartening,"" the office said in a statement. ""This case was hard fought and led to the successful prosecution of a deeply corrupt federal agent. We intend to urge the Florida Attorney General to challenge this decision."" Connolly allegedly accepted payoffs and, in turn, tipped off Bulger and his associate Stephen ""The Rifleman"" Flemmi to the identities of cooperating witnesses and pending investigations, according to information revealed in court during Bulger's racketeering trial last year. Connolly was serving a 40-year sentence on second-degree murder charges for allegedly leaking the identity of Callahan, who had agreed to cooperate against Bulger's Winter Hill Gang. During the first two decades of his FBI career, Connolly won kudos in the bureau's Boston office, cultivating informants against New England mobsters. Prosecutors during his trial said Connolly was corrupted by his two highest-ranking snitches: Bulger and Flemmi. Connolly retired from the FBI in 1990 and later was indicted on federal racketeering and other charges stemming from his long relationship with Bulger and Flemmi. He was convicted of racketeering in 2002 and was serving a 10-year federal prison sentence when he was indicted in 2005 in the Callahan slaying. Bulger gets 2 life sentences plus 5 years . Bulger housed at federal prison in Tuscon . CNN's Jean Casarez, Sunny Hostin and Rich Phillips contributed to this report.","Former FBI agent John Connolly was convicted in 1982 murder .

"(CNN) -- Ah, London. Theater. Art. Fashion. Shopping. Nightlife. Meals you'll never forget (and that can be meant, now, in a good way.) Is there anything she doesn't do superlatively? Like every glittering metropolis, however, it can be easy to miss the highlights amid all the noise and haste. This mini-guide is filled with the information you need to get in and out of London while impressing the clients and co-workers and still having time to eat royally, take jealousy-inducing pictures and pick up the kinds of souvenirs the folks back home will actually keep. Fastest airport transport . London has several international airports and all are serviced by public transportation into central London in around an hour and a half. But why struggle on and off trains with luggage if you don't have to? By far the most comfortable way to get from the airport into the city is by using a car service. One of the most reliable local services is Addison Lee. The company says it can get you into central London from Heathrow in 45 minutes ($72) and from Gatwick in an hour and 20 minutes ($111). Good news if you use ride-share service Uber. It works in London. Addison Lee, +44 (0)20 7387 8888 . Great rooms, great views . London has plenty of high-end accommodations, from heritage hotels to glossy futuristic skyscrapers. For Old World style, Claridge's is a top choice. Its opulent art deco interiors have played host to stars like Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant. Some Deluxe King rooms have views of Brook Street, a Mayfair parade lined with fine restaurants and lavish boutiques. For quirky design and English eccentric styling, the Ham Yard Hotel in vibrant Soho is a good bet. Each room is individually designed with bold patterns and luxurious fabrics. Room 302 offers views over the bohemian party district. If the diversions of Soho aren't enough, the hotel has its own movie theater and bowling alley. For London's most breathtaking views, you can't go wrong with the new Shangri-La at The Shard, in London's tallest building. It's located in the London Bridge area, which gives easy access to The City and is a few steps away from Borough Market, the city's finest open-air food market. The hotel's Iconic City View Room offers floor-to-ceiling windows that allow you to gaze across the Thames River at St. Paul's Cathedral, Big Ben and The Gherkin.

London is teeming with competitive foodies and the best restaurants are often filled weeks in advance -- it's wise to book ahead. Michelin-starred Gymkhana is an elegant ""Raj-era India"" place to sample high-end Anglo-Indian -- a kind of adopted national cuisine in the UK. For the perfect experience, chef-owner Karam Sethi recommends Muntjac biryani, which combines Indian spices with the best British game produce. He also suggests kid goat keema -- and opt to add ""bheja,"" brains, for extra richness. Another London institution that gives international flavors the modern British treatment is Ottolenghi, owned by Jerusalemite chef Yotam Ottolenghi, who's known for his bestselling cookbooks. The menu changes regularly but Ottolenghi says roasted aubergine is a must -- it's always on the menu and currently with nutty almond yoghurt, pickled chili and paprika toasted almonds. Night owls who like views as fancy as the food should try Duck and Waffle, on the 40th floor of a skyscraper near London's hip East End. It's open 24/7. Executive chef Daniel Doherty advises diners to order the signature dish: a fluffy Belgian waffle with a fried duck egg and mustard-infused maple syrup. For traditional English with a twist there's Dinner by Heston Blumenthal, at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Hyde Park. The celebrated restaurant serves big flavors inspired by recipes from the UK's daddy of molecular gastronomy. Iconic dishes include Tipsy Cake with spit-roasted pineapple and meat fruit (a tangy layer of fruit jelly, shaped like a mandarin, encasing a silky chicken liver parfait).

All the big international brands are represented in London and there are plenty of high-end department stores, but the best-kept secret is the city's boutiques, which show off the wealth of homegrown fashion. For immaculate tailoring with eccentric touches, both men and women head to British institution Paul Smith's newest shop in Mayfair to invest in their business wardrobes. These include this season's Chartreuse Cashmere-Blend Epsom Coat and Slim-Fit Navy Wool Suit, with trademark modish tailoring. Contemporary British menswear is all about a minimalist, utilitarian look. You can nail the style with a few pieces from Albam in Soho. There's the New Slim Jean made with Japanese selvedge denim or the Scottish Virgin Wool Shawl Neck Sweater. But you haven't shopped in London until you've been to Liberty. A department store with the feel of a boutique, it stocks high-end cosmetics, designer sunglasses, jewelry, vintage handbags and home wares, as well as an impressive selection of items from international and British designers. Among these are the Oxblood Liberty Print rucksack and the Barbour Olive Hooded Game Parka. Paul Smith, 9 Albemarle St., London; +44 (0)20 7493 4565 .

As London was named selfie capital of the world earlier this year, it'd be wrong to leave without getting a few. The obvious places remain the best. For the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben, you'll get the best shot by walking halfway across Westminster Bridge, which crosses the Thames. For a stunning picture of yourself next to St. Paul's Cathedral, go to the Millennium Bridge, which runs between the cathedral and the Tate Modern art gallery. If you can round up a few friends, there's always the crossing at Abbey Road, where you can recreate the iconic 1969 Beatles album cover and appear on the new Abbey Road Studios Crossing Cam. Neighborhoods in a nutshell . One of the joys of London is its neighborhoods. Locals talk about each area as a ""village"" with its own identity and feel. Here's a brief selection that you won't regret taking time out of your day to explore. Covent Garden . The charms of this theater, shopping and eating district are hard to beat. Covent Garden was one of London's first markets and the marketplace still stands in the Piazza, where you'll find street performers and al fresco stalls. For shopping, you can head for the narrow streets near the tube station or see if you can score a last-minute ticket at the Royal Opera House. Covent Garden, Bow Street, London; +44 (0)20 7420 5856 . Bloomsbury . The heart of London's academic district is a stone's throw from the West End. Leafy and grand, full of garden squares and Georgian terraces, this is where you'll find The British Museum and The University of London. It's also culturally significant, giving its name to the Bloomsbury Group of artists, the most famous of whom was Virginia Woolf. Karl Marx and Charles Darwin worked on their theories here, too. British Museum, Great Russell Street, London; +44 (0)20 7323 8299 . Notting Hill . A few tube stops west of central London, this well-heeled area around Westbourne Grove and Ledbury Road is full of boutiques and cafes, while Portobello Road, lined with charming terraces of pastel-colored houses, has an excellent antiques market. One of the surprises of the area is the cultural mix, with Afro-Caribbean roots culture and trendy wealth rubbing against each other. The mix finds its full expression each August at the Notting Hill Carnival, the largest street fair of its kind in Europe. Decent souvenirs . There's no need to go home with a pair of Union Jack boxer shorts or a gold-edged plate with a picture of Kate and Wills in the middle. London's many art galleries all have shops attached and are a great source of presents and souvenirs that are tasteful and different. At the Tate Modern shop, you can pick up a reproduction of a 1950s Matisse exhibition poster ($40) or a tea towel printed with a Turner landscape ($12). Alternatively, the award-winning Snowden Flood shop specializes in well-designed souvenirs. Highlights include a beautiful Regent's Park Scented Candle, perfumed with oak, bay and rosemary oils, or a Tower Bridge dinner plate. Tate Modern, Bankside, London; +44 (0)20 7887 8888 .

"The July heat wave that wilted crops, shriveled rivers and fueled wildfires officially went into the books Wednesday as the hottest single month on record for the continental United States. The average temperature across the Lower 48 was 77.6 degrees Fahrenheit, 3.3 degrees above the 20th-century average, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported. That edged out the previous high mark, set in 1936, by two-tenths of a degree, NOAA said. In addition, the seven months of 2012 to date are the warmest of any year on record and were drier than average as well, NOAA said. U.S. forecasters started keeping records in 1895. Animated map: U.S. drought in 2012 . And the past 12 months have been the warmest of any such period on record, topping a mark set between July 2011 and this past June. Every U.S. state except Washington experienced warmer-than-average temperatures, NOAA reported. The high temperatures have contributed to a ""rapid expansion"" of drought across the central United States, NOAA found. Dozens of cities and towns already have seen the mercury hit record levels this summer, and three states -- Nebraska, Kansas and Arkansas -- saw record dry conditions between May and July. That's battered American farmers' corn and soybean crops, driven farmers to sell or slaughter cattle they can't feed and spurred the U.S. Department of Agriculture to designate more than half of all U.S. counties as disaster zones.

"(CNN) -- Dennis Rodman's latest round of controversial ""basketball diplomacy"" in a country ruled by one of the world's most repressive regimes is about to begin. The former NBA star and a documentary crew are due to fly Thursday afternoon from China to North Korea, where he is to spend four days helping train a team of North Korean basketball players for a January exhibition in Pyongyang. That January 8 exhibition -- said to be against a yet-unannounced team of former NBA players -- will celebrate the birthday of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, whom Rodman has called a friend and a ""very good guy"" despite international condemnation of the country's human rights records. Rodman's trip -- sponsored by the online betting company Paddy Power -- is the 52-year-old's third to North Korea. North Korea: Reality vs. the world according to Dennis Rodman . Rodman said he struck a friendship with Kim, a basketball fan, during Rodman's first trip in February. After the two men sat next to each other watching a basketball exhibition in North Korea's capital, Rodman told Kim that ""you have a friend for life."" Rory Scott, a Paddy Power spokesman, said earlier this month that December's trip is nonpolitical, but is intended ""to prove once again that sport has the power to rise above all issues."" It's not clear whether Rodman will meet with Kim during the basketball training visit. The trip comes at a time of political turmoil in the secretive nuclear-armed nation, ongoing tensions between North Korea and the United States and outcries over North Korea's human rights record. Tensions in the region were ratcheted up as North Korea carried out a long-range rocket launch a year ago and an underground nuclear test, its third so far, in February. The U.N. sanctions that followed were met by a barrage of threatening rhetoric from Pyongyang. Rodman was criticized over his first trip in part because it came during this period, in which North Korea was threatening missile strikes on the United States, South Korea and Japan. The situation has calmed since. But in a sign of internal political upheaval, North Korea announced last week that the regime had executed Kim's uncle, Jang Song Thaek, who had been regarded as the country's second-most powerful figure. North Korea's official news agency accused him of trying to overthrow the state. Rodman is ""really important"" to the North Korean regime, said North Korea expert and Forbes.com columnist Gordon Chang. ""Got to remember that Kim Jong Un needs to show that his regime, his government, is united, which it isn't,"" said Chang, author of ""Nuclear Showdown: North Korea Takes On the World."" ""With Dennis Rodman, we're going to see a lot of made-for-television events. Everybody's going to be smiling, everything will appear normal, and this will bolster the regime,"" Chang told CNN Newsroom on Wednesday. CNN Exclusive: The Pyongyang Big Bang? 'It is not my job to talk about' detained American . The United States has other points of contention with North Korea, including the detention of Korean-American Kenneth Bae. Bae, arrested in North Korea in November 2012, was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor after he was found guilty of ""hostile acts"" and attempts to topple the government through religious activities. U.S. officials have repeatedly called on North Korean officials to release Bae, widely reported to be a Christian missionary, on humanitarian grounds. His family has said he suffers from chronic health conditions that require doctors' care. Is Dennis Rodman smart on North Korea? Earlier this year, Rodman made no secret about his desire to help Bae. He tweeted that he wanted Kim to ""do him a solid"" by freeing the American prisoner. But after his second trip to see Kim in September, Rodman told reporters that it was ""not my job to talk about Kenneth Bae."" ""Ask Obama about that, ask Hillary Clinton about that,"" Rodman said. ""Ask those ---holes."" Bae's sister, Terri Chung, told CNN on Wednesday that she wants Rodman to press for her brother's freedom. ""I would certainly hope and plead with Mr. Rodman to reconsider and ... make the case"" for Bae's freedom, she said. Rodman, the tattooed and pierced NBA retiree, has emphasized that he's not an official diplomat between the United States and North Korea. ""It's about trying to open Obama's and everyone's minds,"" he said in September while announcing the January exhibition, aiming some of his remarks at the U.S. president. ""You don't have to talk about politics. ... Meet him or even give him a call. That's all he wants."" Paddy Power has said Rodman's team of former NBA players would be announced sometime this month.o . North Korea frees U.S. veteran .

"Gruesome and seemingly endless accounts of violence in Mexico have obscured one notable bright spot in Latin America's high-stakes struggle with powerful drug gangs. In Colombia, once home to the world's biggest cocaine cartels, new crime organizations are being picked apart with silent efficiency -- aided by Bogota's enthusiastic embrace of extradition. In recent years, more than 1,300 of Colombia's top crime bosses and their most dangerous enforcers have been sent north to face trafficking charges in the United States, a dramatic turnabout from the 1990s when extradition was outlawed under coercive pressure from the Medellin and Cali cartels. Traffickers who might have continued to operate their drug organizations from luxury prison cells near their Colombian homes find themselves serving extended terms far away in U.S. penitentiaries without wall-to-wall carpets, big-screen TVs or easy phone access. Many offer to become witnesses hoping to reduce their sentences. The result has been a steady erosion of organized crime's capabilities in Colombia -- a lesson for Mexico and other countries in the region threatened by drug gangs. Mexico's historic reluctance to extradite its citizens to the United States should be reassessed in the face of Colombia's success. The beauty of extradition as practiced by Colombia is not its power to stop drug smuggling. There is scant evidence it has had much direct effect in that regard. But it continues to splinter the leadership of trafficking gangs, keeping them in a perpetual state of rebuilding. In short, extradition disorganizes organized crime. And that's what makes it such a winning strategy in a country once thoroughly compromised by cartel threats and bribes. In those days, barely 20 years ago, the Medellin and Cali cartels vied for power with the Bogota government that too often seemed to be a hostage to criminal forces. Extradition became the prize they fought over. Pablo Escobar, once the most feared thug in the drug world, was so afraid of being carted off for trial in Florida or Texas or New York that he demanded an end to extradition. He famously insisted that he preferred ""the grave in Colombia"" to a prison cell in the States. But when his demands were unheeded, Escobar launched a terror campaign of political assassination, socialite kidnappings, and deadly bombings. While Escobar went to war, rival Cali cartel bosses went to the bank. They spread favors of cash, women and Caribbean vacations to any and all receptive politicians. Democracy was no match for the combined forces of corruption and intimidation. Colombia capitulated to the drug kings and let cartel lawyers rewrite portions of the national constitution to outlaw extradition. It was banned for more than six years until restored in December 1997. More recently, its use soared as part of former President Alvaro Uribe's campaign to disarm and demobilize narco-trafficking paramilitary groups. And he put extradition processing on a fast track after discovering that imprisoned gangsters were still running criminal enterprises from their Colombian jails. Colombia remains highly motivated today by fear of a return to the bad old days when criminal demands trumped national interests. And its success has been noticed. Mexico is showing more willingness to extradite Mexican nationals accused of major trafficking offenses in the U.S., but its numbers are small compared with Colombia's. About a dozen Mexican drug bosses are in various stages of extradition, a cumbersome and often frustrating process that can take two to five years. U.S. authorities complain that, among other things, Mexico requires excessive documentation before approving extradition applications -- notably the identities of certain key witnesses that can jeopardize their safety. Some of the lingering reluctance comes from national pride, from the conviction that Mexico should and can take care of its own crime problems. To that end, Mexican anti-narcotics units have been beefed up and security at its federal prisons improved. But that's not enough. ""There's no prison anywhere in Mexico or Colombia that puts these guys out of business like U.S. prisons,"" says one American law enforcement official. There is a cost, of course. Federal prosecutions and extended incarcerations are expensive. Yet, what are the alternatives? When Colombia was overrun by cartels, the U.S. poured in a billion dollars of aid to help a friend and ally fight back. Recently, Texas Gov. Rick Perry suggested sending U.S. troops to help Mexico, an option loaded with political as well as financial costs. It only underscores the point: Extradition is a bargain. It's also the most potent weapon against organized crime available in the region. Mexico and its Central American neighbors should embrace it with Colombian enthusiasm.

"Sandra Bullock is one of the highest-profile actresses in Hollywood and also one of the world's most photographed moms. It's hard to pick up a tabloid that doesn't feature a photo of the Oscar-winner with her adopted 3-year-old son, Louis Bardot. And now Bullock is speaking out in support of a new law that increases penalties for paparazzi harassing the children of celebrities. ""We are fair game, I get it,"" Bullock told CNN at her handprint and footprint ceremony outside the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood on Wednesday. ""Children should be allowed to be children and not be sold. You're taking a picture of a child and selling it!"" California Gov. Jerry Brown on Tuesday signed the bill, which increases the penalties for intentional harassment of a child because of their parents' employment. The effort gained momentum after actresses Halle Berry and Jennifer Garner testified before the California Assembly Judiciary Committee in August to support the bill. The pair opened up about the hellish conditions faced by their children as a result of aggressive paparazzi. Nicole Kidman knocked down by photog . Bullock commends the two on their fight. ""I think it's brilliant,"" she explains.""The girls worked so hard, the attorney worked so hard, and I think it's a good sign."" According to a release from the governor's office, the new law ""increases the maximum jail time for harassment of a child or ward because of the person's employment from six months in the county jail to a year in the county jail."" It also imposes increasingly stiff fines: For a first violation, a fine not to exceed $10,000. For a second violation, it's $20,000. For a third violation, it's $30,000. The ""Gravity"" star made a rare choice to bring young Louis with her to a media event, a decision Bullock is quick to defend. ""Today, I brought him out because this was a family day. It was the one exception that I make."" ""And this way,"" she continued, ""when he's 16 and he hates me, I can take him to this moment and say, 'Look, people said really nice things about your mother...' "" The current Vogue magazine cover star reveals her son becomes fearful for his own safety and that of his mom when going out. ""When you go to school, or you're at an airport, the reason he doesn't like this is because he's used to people running at him, and he thinks they're going to hurt mom or hurt him."" Bullock is thankful for the law and what it will mean as a mother and one of the Hollywood's biggest stars. ""This'll be great. This will allow children to be children. ... I'm so grateful.""","Bullock supports new law that increase penalties for paparazzi harassing children .

"Federal health authorities Monday added 58 types of cancer to the list of covered illnesses for people who were exposed to toxins at the site of the World Trade Center in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. The addition finalizes a recommendation from Dr. John Howard, administrator of the World Trade Center Health Program. Howard proposed in June that the program accept the recommendations of its Science/Technical Advisory Committee and add some cancers to the coverage list -- 14 categories in all. Firefighters responding to 9/11 at increased cancer risk . The advisory committee review called for expanded ""coverage for certain types of cancer resulting from exposure to toxins released at Ground Zero."" ""The publication of this final rule marks an important step in the effort to provide needed treatment and care to 9/11 responders and survivors through the WTC Health Program,"" Howard said in a statement Monday. The rule is expected to be published Wednesday in the Federal Register, and will take effect 30 days after its publication, Howard said. 9/11 detective dies after battle with lung cancer . First responders, volunteers, survivors of the attacks and residents near the site who meet specific qualifications will be eligible for coverage, according to the World Trade Center Health Program. According to the proposed rule, an estimated 950 to 2,150 people would take advantage of the additional coverage. The estimated cost for the total cancer treatment ranges between $14.5 million and $33 million, the proposal said. The original bill as passed by the House had a 30-year compensation program, but the Senate reduced it to five years. Many cancers may not appear for decades after an exposure, according to experts. The World Trade Center Health Program was created as a result of the passage of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. The Zadroga Act, passed by Congress in December 2010, is designed to provide medical services and compensation for responders who were exposed to toxins while working at ground zero. President Barack Obama signed the $4.2 billion legislation in January 2011. The law is named after a New York police officer who died of a respiratory disease attributed to working amid the toxic chemicals at the attack site. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg hailed the addition Monday. ""Tomorrow we will remember those we lost to the 9/11 terrorist attacks and also those who bravely responded during and after the tragedy,"" he said in a statement. ""As part of our ongoing commitment to our first responders, New York City led the way in ensuring that the Zadroga Act included reviews of the medical evidence so that all those ill from exposure to the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks receive the care they need. ""We have urged from the very beginning that the decision whether or not to include cancer be based on science; Dr. Howard's decision, made after thorough consideration of the latest available research and data, will continue to ensure that those who have become ill due to the heinous attacks on 9/11 will get the medical care they need and deserve,"" Bloomberg said. 9/11 responders wait for compensation for their illnesses . New York Reps. Carolyn B. Maloney, Jerrold Nadler and Peter T. King, said in a joint statement in June the proposal ""helps pave the way for expanding the scope of available medical care and compensation for those sickened by the toxins at Ground Zero."" ""As we have all seen with our own eyes again and again, cancer incidence among responders and survivors is a tragic fact, and we must continue to do everything we can to provide the help that those who are sick need and deserve,"" the lawmakers said. The move is an about-face from Howard's announcement in July 2011, when he stated that cancer treatments would not be covered by the compensation fund. At the time, Howard said there was inadequate ""published scientific and medical findings"" to link September 11 exposures to cancer.

"(CNN) -- The biggest sporting event on the globe may be taking place in Brazil at the World Cup, but try telling that to Royal Ascot. The Royal Meeting kicked off today in typically grandiose style, amid a flurry of hats and horses. The traditional curtain-raiser is the Group One Queen Anne Stakes, a race won so memorably in recent years by Frankel. This year saw an international field which would not have looked out of the place in Brazil, with runners hailing from France, South Africa and the United States as well as the UK and Ireland. The race was won by hot favorite Toronado, giving trainer Richard Hannon Jr. his first Royal Ascot winner in his first season with a license having taken over from his father over the winter. In the Coventry Stakes, Frankie Dettori secured his 48th victory at Ascot by riding The Wow Signal home -- his first win at the course for two years. ""It's important to start the meeting well, it's been a few years since my last winner here, but I'm getting close to 50 now,"" he told reporters. Elsewhere, Sole Power sprinted to a second consecutive victory in the King's Stand Stakes. The seven-year-old, ridden by Richard Hughes, claimed a comfortable victory to underline his class. The day's feature race, the St James's Palace Stakes, was billed as a rematch between the John Gosden-trained Kingman, at one time regarded as a worthy successor to Frankel for owner Khalid Abdullah, and surprise 2,000 Guineas winner Night of Thunder. In the event, the race did not disappoint, with Kingman reversing the Guineas result with a devastating victory under James Doyle; a suitably regal victory on the opening day of a meeting as recognized for its pomp off the track as the racing on it. This meeting traces its ancestry back to 1711, when Sir William Wyndham, Master of the Royal Buckhounds, was ordered by his monarch to clear Ascot Heath in preparation for a horse race. The bond between this racecourse and royalty runs deep: the Queen herself typically attends all five days, arriving by horse-drawn carriage from Windsor Castle. The Queen's arrival is the subject of as much fascination as the racing itself, with bookies taking bets on the color of her hat.","World famous Ascot Festival began Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Gai Waterhouse made history on Tuesday by becoming the first female Australian trainer to win the Melbourne Cup, the country's most prestigious horse race. Waterhouse saw her pre-race favorite Fiorente fend off competition from 2011 runner-up Red Cadeaux to win ""the race that stops a nation."" ""Everyone wants to win the majors and the Melbourne Cup is the biggest one of them all,"" said Waterhouse, who was born in Scotland, raised in Sydney and once appeared in British sci-fi television show Doctor Who during her earlier career as an actress after returning to the UK. ""It's a burning desire so today was fantastic ... His (Fiorente's) preparation was in Melbourne and I knew he was primed for the occasion. ""It's the first time I've had the favorite in the 20 years I've trained."" Victorious jockey Damien Oliver won the Flemington race for the third time in his career, despite only recently returning from a 10-month ban imposed for betting on a rival horse in 2010. ""It's amazing, a dream come true. It's really hard to believe,"" said Oliver. ""I'm so rapt right now that I've been part of Gai's first win -- she's done so much for racing and it's a great honor for me to help her bring up the first one. ""Gai was one of the first people to really get behind me when I came back and I can't thank her enough for helping me get going again."" After her historic win, Waterhouse was asked about the possibility of taking both Fiorente and her other horse Tres Blue, which finished in 22nd place, across to Britain for Royal Ascot in August 2014. ""I'd like to go,"" she replied. ""Both horses could easily come back to Europe. Tres Blue was just a bit new to it all."" Retired English football star Michael Owen saw Brown Panther, a horse he bred and co-owns, finish the race in eighth position. Brown Panther was hampered by a gash it sustained during the race after a coming together with another horse, but Owen confirmed the animal had suffered no serious injuries. ""Eighth out of 24 pretty respectable,"" Owen said via his official Twitter account. ""Proud of him. Just hope he is OK as he has been struck into during the race."" ""Scan has come back clear,"" Owen added later. ""Only superficial gash that requires stitches. We live to fight another day!""","Favorite Fiorente wins the Melbourne Cup at Flemington Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Defending champion Usain Bolt was sensationally disqualified for a false start in the men's 100-meter final at the world athletics championships in Daegu, South Korea, allowing fellow-Jamaican Yohan Blake to collect an unexpected gold medal. Bolt has dominated men's sprinting since winning 100-meter and 200-meter gold at the Beijing Olympics in 2008, achieving the same feat at the world championships in Berlin the following year -- smashing the world record in the process. And although he had not entered this year's worlds in top form, the absence through injury of rivals Asafa Powell and Tyson Gay meant he was the hot favorite to retain the first part of the sprint double. However, the 25-year-old fell foul of the current false start rules, which state that any athlete who jumps the gun is immediately disqualified. Bolt knew immediately he had started too early and was helped off the track, head in hands, with a packed stadium watching on in disbelief. Once the race did eventually get under way, a muted atmosphere ensued as Blake -- a training partner of Bolt -- powered home to win in 9.92 seconds. American Walter Dix, the Olympic bronze medallist, took silver with a time of 10.08 seconds with veteran 2003 world champion Kim Collins of St. Kitts and Nevis claiming a superb bronze medal. ""I can't find words to explain it. Usain Bolt has been there for me. I feel like I want to cry,"" Blake told reporters. ""I felt I would win the race for Bolt."" Despite Bolt's shock exit, it proved a good day for defending world champions, with three athletes retaining the titles they won two years ago in Berlin. American Brittney Reese retained her women's long jump title, and compatriot Trey Hardee won a second consecutive decathlon gold medal. Meanwhile, Russian Valeriy Borchin was another to retain his title, coming home first in the men's 20-kilometer walk. Li Yanfeng of China secured gold in the women's discus, but there was heartache for Ethiopian distance legend Kenenisa Bekele, whose attempts at a fifth consecutive men's 10,000-meter world title came to an end after he was forced to pull out of the final with groin and hip injuries. However, the gold medal still went to Ethiopia with Ibrahim Jeilan outsprinting Briton Mo Farah in a devastating burst to the line. Meanwhile, Oscar Pistorius made history by becoming the first amputee athlete to compete in world championships history.

"(CNN) -- Plane passengers are used to paying for check-in baggage or priority boarding, but one airport in Venezuela is now charging for the ultimate hidden extra -- air. Anyone departing from the Simon Bolivar International Airport of Maiquetia in Caracas now faces a levy of 127 bolivars ($18) to pay for a new air conditioning unit installed earlier this year, according to a statement on the airport's website. The airport says its air conditioning system ""eliminates contaminants"" and injects ozone into the atmosphere to improve the environment and protect the health of passengers. It boasts that the system is the first of its kind in an airport anywhere in South America and the Caribbean. The ""breathing tax"" which came into force on July 1 and must be paid by all domestic and international passengers to airlines at check in, has generated bemusement in Venezuela, with many taking to Twitter to criticize the measure. ""While the stench of the toilets asphyxiates me ... they have started to charge 127 bolivars for breathing the ozone,"" wrote Vero (@VeronicaTorresA). Another, Chipopo (@ELvDav) comments that whatever task the air conditioning unit performs, it doesn't seem to include lowering the temperature. ""Maiquetia airport is 36 C, it must be the injection of ozone that makes the temperature shoot up,"" they write. Daniel Martinez (@DanielMartinezD), a radio presenter, tweeted his gripes about the measure. ""Could you explain to me the ozone thing in Maiquetia? The toilets have no water, the air-con is broken, there are stray dogs inside the airport, but there's ozone?"" Several international airlines, including Air Canada and Alitalia have suspended or reduced flights to Venezuela in recent months, blaming strict government currency controls that they say have have left them billions of dollars out of pocket. Earlier this week the country's air transport minister, Luis Caraballo Graterol, insisted in an interview that Venezuela had no debts to foreign air carriers. Built in 1945, Maiquetia airport -- as it is known by locals -- is the main international air hub serving Venezuela. It's currently undergoing a major overhaul, according to Worldtravelguide.net .","Venezuela's Simon Bolivar International Airport of Maiquetia demands $18 for air conditioning .

"(CNN) -- The website for London law firm Doughty Street Chambers crashed Tuesday after reports emerged that human rights attorney Amal Alamuddin, who married George Clooney in late September, had changed her name to Amal Clooney, as seen on her professional profile page. Everyone had to see for themselves -- and, predictably, throw up their collective arms in response. Could it be? Could it be that this strong, career-driven woman so not-in-need of a man that she'd waited 36 years to get married really have done something as oppressive as take on her husband's name? In Elle, Natalie Matthews admitted ""a twinge of disappointment. ... Women keeping their maiden names is not just a rare phenomenon but a decreasing one,"" as if she expected Amal to help fight the trend. ""Dear Mrs. Clooney,"" an open letter by Tracy Spicer on the website The Hoopla began, ""why why, WHY, in 2014, would you take your husband's name? You're an appendage, an accoutrement, a chattel: Mrs. Clooney. And I thought progressives were supposed to be -- well -- progressive...?"" Wrote another, ""Just think of how absurd it would be if Clooney called himself George Alamuddin."" Oh, boy. My question: Who says that a woman's entire identity is rooted in the name she was given at birth or born into? These days, an increasing number of women are making a name for themselves professionally, as Alamuddin has done and will surely continue to do. Opinion: Why more women spurn marriage . The key phrase here being ""for themselves."" Whether that name is the one they were born with, the one they took after marriage or any combination thereof matters little. It's just a name. And a woman needn't keep her name in order to prove, to anyone, that she is her own person. In fact, she needn't be required to prove it at all. If anything, it seems to be buying entirely into the patriarchy to dismiss Amal as being anti-feminist, or even anti-progressive, over a choice that she has, by all available evidence, made for herself. And we must assume it's one she's made, or agreed to make, or else aren't we're the ones being sexist? After all, the former Ms. Alamuddin does not seem to be a woman who has come this far in life, or career, by making decisions lightly. Abandoning the name that made her successful -- and, in her own right, famous, if not as famous as her new husband -- does not negate those successes. The truth is that many women choose not to change their names after marriage; some for professional reasons, others for personal reasons. Some are just lazy. Do you know what a pain in the you-know-what it is to legally change your name? And yet far more women do change their names than don't: As much as 86% of women, according to a 2011 survey conducted by TheKnot.com, take on their husband's surname after marriage. And, of course, Amal might even relish being something of ""an appendage,"" as Catherine Meyer, writing in Time, described Mrs. Clooney, a new celebrity whose wedding photos run in People magazine and whose choice of dress is covered by Vogue. She is accomplished, that is certain; but now she is also George Clooney's wife, and that is something irresistible to our celebrity-obsessed culture and perhaps irresistible to Amal, too. (He is George Clooney, after all.) Perhaps she is courting attention by changing her name. Maybe it's a good career move: Should we fault her for using what she can to get ahead? Or should we, in fact, celebrate her for being ambitious? That some may look to women like Amal to retain their name post-marriage is, of course, reflective of an unfair burden placed on women who reach certain levels of success, or notoriety, to please everyone and be the spokeswomen for an entire gender ever-aiming to assert itself as equal to men. By that logic, it's not Amal's name change that should be viewed as anti-feminist but her willingness to get married at all. Who needs men, right? The bottom line is that Amal Alamuddin Clooney has proved herself to be her own woman, and a strong, independent, accomplished one at that, no matter how the name reads on her business card -- or, for that matter, her own paycheck. How much more do we want from her as a model of female empowerment?","Amal Alamuddin changed her last name to Clooney after she married George .

"(CNN) -- Sure hope Amal isn't upset. George Clooney took an apparent break from his honeymoon with Amal Alamuddin to make a surprise appearance Thursday at New York Comic Con. The actor, who was there to talk about his role in next summer's ""Tomorrowland,"" admitted he wondered himself what he was doing there. ""It is not lost on me that I am spending my honeymoon at Comic Con,"" said Clooney, according to several reports from the event. Marriage seems to be treating Clooney well so far.

"(WIRED) -- Ford is making its cars into mobile Wi-Fi hot spots. The next generation of the Sync in-car entertainment and information system will use a USB mobile broadband modem to establish a secure wireless connection capable of supporting several devices simultaneously. The system will be available next year on selected models -- no word yet which ones -- and you won't need a subscription or hardware beyond the modem. ""While you're driving to grandma's house, your spouse can be finishing the holiday shopping and the kids can be chatting with friends and updating their Facebook profiles,"" said Mark Fields, Ford president of the Americas. ""And you're not paying for yet another mobile subscription or piece of hardware because Ford will let you use technology you already have."" Several automakers already offer in-car Internet access -- Japanese drivers have been using it since 1997 -- and many others are rushing to bring it to us. Ford's announcement follows General Motors' promise last week to make in-car connectivity available in seven models of trucks and SUVs. They're the latest automakers to bring the infobahn to the autobahn. Mercedes recently announced it has successfully tested in-vehicle Internet applications -- including web browsing, vehicle software updates and VOIP -- on a prototype 4G network. It follows BMW's Internet-connected iDrive system and Chrysler's Uconnect Web in-vehicle mobile hotspot. With so many automakers getting in on the action, there's a push to introduce hardware standards. Ford is taking a decidedly different approach, opting to allow consumers to plug in their own USB modem to get connected. General Motors, on the other hand, offers a dealer-installed system called Chevrolet Wi-Fi by Autonet Mobile. It creates a Wi-Fi hot spot 300 feet in diameter around the vehicle, and GM claims the 3G network achieves speeds of up to 1.5 mbps. The hardware costs $199 after the $200 mail-in rebate, and the service costs $29 a month. Given how connected we are, it makes sense for automakers to put the Internet in our cars. The number of iPhones and other mobile devices being used to connect to the Internet jumped 75 percent in the third quarter of this year, according to JiWire Mobile Audiences Insights Report. Letting people log on from the road will be a big selling point among 20-something buyers, the so-called Millennials who have propelled much of Sync's success. Millennials will make up 28 percent of the driving population next year, a nine-point increase from 2004. Kids aside, Ford says interest in in-car connectivity is high among the general public, with one-third of people surveyed by the Consumer Electronics Association expressing interest in being able to check e-mail or surf the Web from the car.

"(CNN) -- With his Hyperloop proposal, Elon Musk isn't the only entrepreneur proposing ways to rev up American transportation. The man who brought us sleek, clean electric Tesla cars and SpaceX -- a private space program that successfully sent a payload to the orbiting space station -- is setting his sights on a radically different mass transit proposal called Hyperloop. Giant vacuum tubes would suck travelers across hundreds of miles in a matter of minutes. Related: Elon Musk wants to revolutionize transportation again . Technology in the Digital Age is spurring creative ideas aimed at improving -- and even reinventing -- the way humans travel. The issue is becoming a pressing one with increasing traffic and vehicle emissions. Musk's idea is one of countless transportation concepts being bandied about -- some of which may blow your hair back, others that may amount to pie in the sky. Some may be closer to reality than you think -- like driverless cars and space tourism. For other ideas, the future is murky. You be the judge. The media loves a good gee-whiz story. Remember the Segway? When that was announced in 2001, we read that these two-wheeled transportation machines would change the way we commute and how cities would be designed. How many Segway owners do you know? Or how about the Shweeb, a pedal-powered transportation system that so impressed the folks at Google, the company gave its inventors $1 million for research and development. In the three years since Shweeb won the award, it hasn't made a lot of news. The lesson is, it's a long way between the drawing board and reality. Related: More transportation coverage . Let's take a look at some of the ideas floating out there that may influence the way we travel from Point A to Point B in the future. Planes . By 2019, a small aircraft-maker reportedly plans to start offering a $5 million two-seater jet aimed at business execs who want to fly as fast as 720 mph -- close to the speed of sound. But, mostly, the buzz around the future of flight surrounds something even faster: supersonic combustion ramjets -- aka scramjets. Imagine flying from New York to Tokyo in under two hours. Scramjet technology could make that dream a reality. Experts predict scramjet engines could propel aircraft as fast as 15 times the speed of sound, according to NASA. Unlike conventional jet engines, scramjet engines have virtually no moving parts. And unlike rockets, scramjet engines would burn oxygen from the atmosphere instead of having to carry heavy tanks full of oxygen. The result: a more efficient vehicle for military or commercial purposes. Last year the Pentagon tested a 25-foot long scramjet called an X-51A Waverider. Such technology could be used to develop ""cruise missile-like weapons that could reach a target on the other side of the planet in minutes instead of hours,"" one expert told CNN. Another application for the technology, he said, is an ""aircraft which could put a quick-reaction force on a far-off battleground within hours instead of days."" A UK-based outfit called Reaction Engines has been working on scramjet technology. It produced a video to show its vision for a passenger aircraft called the A2, which would fly five times the speed of sound. This month Reaction Engines announced a partnership with the European Space Agency to figure out its next system to launch vehicles into orbit. Related: How we'll travel in 2022 . Trains . Early in the Obama administration, federal transportation officials began pushing the idea of high-speed rail, by offering taxpayer dollars to interested states. One of those states is California. On its website, California's high-speed rail project still officially promises service from San Francisco to the Los Angeles area in under three hours at more than 200 mph. But the program's initial projected cost of $34 billion has ballooned to $118 billion. Officials are considering a slower, less ambitious train system, CNN Special Investigations Correspondent Drew Griffin reports. Related: Is California high speed rail for real? Related: Would you board a moving train? In the Northeastern United States,  Amtrak operates Acela Express -- a rail service capable of speeds up to 150 mph that shoot riders from New York City to Washington in about 96 minutes. Responding to critics who say Acela is too slow and too infrequently reaches its top speed, Amtrak plans to run test trains at 165 mph in Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. High-speed rail critics often oppose it because they say it costs taxpayers too much. Which is why a proposal in Texas is so interesting. The Texas Central Railway has a plan to build a high-speed train without any taxpayer dollars. Spanning the nearly 240 miles separating Dallas and Houston, a Japanese-style ""bullet train"" reportedly would haul 500 passengers in just 90 minutes. Maximum speed: around 220 mph. If all goes as planned, the train would be running by 2020, according to organizers. Related: Vehicles that changed the world . Automobiles . Drivers? Who needs 'em? We've got computers! Driverless cars have been legal in California for nearly a year. Carmakers Audi, BMW, Mercedes and Volvo are planning to offer automated vehicles by the end of this year, The New York Times reported. As more computers take the driver's seat, it remains to be seen how driverless cars will safely interact with cars piloted by humans. Other car-related transportation ideas are winding their way through the national conversation. How about solar-powered smart-roads? Inventor Scott Brusaw has proposed building a national network of wired highways made of very strong glass. Solar electricity generated by the highways would recharge electric vehicles that use the road. The highway's streetlights and LED warning signs also would be powered by the road. Space . Justin Bieber's on board. Who else wants to fly to the edge of space? Bieber has signed on to be among Virgin Galactic's first passengers. The company -- founded by billionaire Richard Branson -- says it's on track for its passenger spacecraft to reach space in a test flight for the first time by the end of this year. More than 500 would-be space tourists have signed up to take short $200,000 flights that would involve several minutes of weightlessness. New Mexico says it's ready for space travel. The state has built a kind of airport for space ships called Spaceport America. It's open for business and NASA has already used the facility for unmanned rockets. Other ideas aimed at going up include a proposal for an elevator that would take cargo and travelers into space. Opinion: Hyperloop could be a reality . Other ideas . What about the extreme future of transportation? Believe it or not, scientists have been talking about an idea of getting from here to there that sounds like something from ""Star Trek."" Could Scotty's ""transporter"" ever become a real thing? In 2007, scientists indicated to CNN that someday it might be possible to scan a person using some advanced form of the technology used to perform MRI scans, and transmit that scanned information somewhere else -- using normal electrical or sound signals -- where it would then be reassembled into an approximation of the original. But there will always be skeptics, like Valerie Jamieson, physics editor of New Scientist Magazine. ""I really don't think it is ever going to happen,"" she said. ""Then again, one thing I've learned is never to underestimate the ingenuity of physicists, so never say never.""

"It's been almost two decades since I was separated from my family, my home and my past as a war child. Last year I was able to travel back to East Africa to find my parents, reconnect with others who survived the war and place my vote in the referendum that would eventually lead to the division of Sudan into two independent states. On July 9 2011, the Republic of South Sudan was born. It's hard to describe how I felt that day as I stood among tens of thousands of South Sudanese men, women and children waving our new flag and screaming ""South Oye! Separation Oye!"" Through two civil wars that lasted a total of 39 years, this is what we had hoped, prayed and fought for; it was hard to believe it was happening in my lifetime. Yes, each one of us has fears, hopes and dreams about how we are transforming into a nation. As a citizen, I don't mind us having to crawl and take small steps in our progress. Development is not a race and for it to be sustainable it should be holistic. We're starting from scratch and have a lot of ground to cover. I was born into Sudan's civil war and before I could read or write I was using an AK47 in the conflict between the Muslim north and Animist/Christian south over the land and natural resources. I protected myself, survived and ended up in the Western world where I had to play catch-up with youth who had much calmer childhoods. It was never easy, but I always tried my best and kept complaints out of my heart by holding tightly onto the hope that one day, I would read and write. This is a dream for many boys and girls who were born on the battlefields of Sudan simply because during the civil war there were no schools at all. Now there are a few in Juba and a significant need for more all across the country. My main concern for the newest nation in the world is not tribalism or corruption -- though they both exist, it's the fact that we are still at war with the National Congress (NCP) of Sudan, the governing official party of Sudan, and this needs to be permanently addressed before moving onto smaller issues. Five months ago I went to South Sudan to vote and raise the flag on the soil of my new country. While we were beginning the countdown to independence the NCP, which is headed by Sudan President Omar Hassan Ahmad Al Bashir, raided Abyei and forced innocent people from their land. Why? Well, the region produces 70% of our oil. As I write this article there are still many innocent people suffering and dying all across the country. If the International Criminal Court does not increase its pressure on President  Al Bashir, a return to war and bloodshed over The Republic of South Sudan's land and natural resources is very likely. That being said, I am very optimistic about the future of my country. We all feel a strong sense of ownership when we think of The Republic of South Sudan because everybody sacrificed and suffered to get us to where we are now. We need to feel the same sense of ownership towards finding solutions to our problems; homemade solutions need to be found to fix what we messed up. To do this we need to work together with world powers while ensuring that the resulting plans hold the interests of South Sudan at heart. The Republic of South Sudan is still a baby; our leaders should be willing to take small steps towards developments and not move too fast. The solutions we put into place need to be in line with our long-term interests while offering short-term relief, which is not always that easy to do. But if the government of South Sudan can provide security and education, the rest will begin to fall into place and matters such as finding alternative energy sources for Juba city can be taken care of. As the youngest nation in the world we have the advantage of learning from the experiences of others, starting with sustainable solutions from the beginning -- electricity made by generators can only take us so far! With my fellow brothers I walked to Ethiopia barefoot without adequate food or water in the rain and burning sun, eating unripe mangoes and dodging the corpses of those who perished along the way. It took 18 years for me to find my way home again and through it, I was blessed to not experience any forms of physical war. But it became clear to me that human drama is unavoidable. All around the world there is corruption, tribalism and division, as many find it easier to pick on those that are different, which is why we need to hold tightly to the good in this world. We are all trying to make it the best way we know how, so when we look at each other as individuals and nations we should do so with compassion.","18 years ago, Ger Duany walked barefoot to Ethiopia from Sudan to escape its civil war .

"Joe Kaczmarek's police scanner pops to life with chatter just before midnight. Moments later, ""Kaz,"" as he's known, is rushing to the scene of a robbery near the Temple University campus alongside fellow veteran photojournalist Jim MacMillan. By the time they arrive, the 20-year-old robbery victim has been taken to the hospital with a gunshot wound to the back. Kaz snatches two cameras from the back seat of his car and jumps into the street. He is roving around the crime tape like a caged lion, snapping photographs as police take away two men in handcuffs. Standing nearby, MacMillan thumbs away at his smartphone, updating Twitter: ""On shooting scene at 17 & C.B.Moore in North Philadelphia now."" Kaz and MacMillan co-founded GunCrisis.org to help curb gun violence plaguing what is supposed to be the City of Brotherly Love. ""I want to put the audience out there in the streets,"" Kaz said. ""I want them to see what I'm seeing every night in this city: The children watching crime scene investigations night after night, day after day. Anything to disrupt this, marginally disrupt this, we consider a success."" After the July 20 shooting massacre in Aurora, Colorado, GunCrisis estimates there have been at least 55 gunshot victims in Philadelphia, and that number is rising. Related story: Have gun control opinions shifted after Aurora? So far this year, the city has seen more than 210 murders. A rate approaching the level set in 2007, when the city saw more than a murder a day and earned its nickname Kila-delphia. At GunCrisis, an open-source interactive journalism project launched in March, the goal is to avoid becoming entangled in gun control debates or in drafting new legislation, MacMillan said. Instead, they try to bring people together to find solutions to the epidemic of homicide by gunfire in Philadelphia. ""Turning around the gun violence epidemic is a tall order,"" MacMillan said. ""It's going to take heroic action, but our cities are full of heroes. We've done this before, and we can do it again. It's not going to go on forever. And the harder we work the sooner we'll put an end to this violence."" Until 2008 MacMillan was a senior photographer and photo-columnist at the Philadelphia Daily News, where he worked since 1991. The Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist, who now teaches journalism, got the idea for the project after viewing a documentary called ""The Interrupters"" during a trauma journalism conference. The film follows ""violence interrupters"" in Chicago who intervene in conflicts before they turn deadly. The small volunteer team at GunCrisis wants to shake things up -- and interrupt the violence -- by chronicling the daily gunfire. ""We believe a coordinated response can lead to a vast reduction in violence, and we want to play a part in that,"" MacMillan said. There's another radio call, and the pair race across town. ""I have a bad feeling about this,"" MacMillan says to Kaz over the static on the police scanner. A man was shot at least 12 times on a residential block in South Philly. Police, who initially heard the shots, rushed him to the hospital where he died a short time later. It's a warm summer night, and law enforcement officers are talking loudly over the hum of window air conditioners. Flashlights flicker, shedding some light on the dark street where a police crime scene unit documents evidence. In just two hours, at least four people had been shot in separate incidents in the city. ""This is a project that I believe in. The city gives us no break. There's an abundance of opportunities to report, unfortunately,"" said Kaz, an independent photojournalist whose work has been featured in The New York Times, Washington Post, Time magazine and USA Today. Philadelphia had 324 homicides last year. Arguments are the leading motive for murder, and blacks make up 85% of the homicide victims, according to police data. Blaming a weak economy, a crumbling public school system and dysfunctional family units, Chuck Williams, director of the Center for the Prevention of School-Aged Violence at Drexel University, said residents are desperate and come from a culture where they learn the way to handle an argument is with a gun. ""This is a people problem, not a government problem,"" said Williams, a Drexel education professor who works with educators and youth to prevent school fights, shootings and cyberbullying. ""I see so much hopelessness and despair. A broken child comes from a broken home, with few exceptions."" Philadelphia successfully attacked the gun crisis in the late 1990s because law enforcement, residents and religious leaders worked together, Williams said, adding that once the body count went down people went back to their lives.

Out of the nation's 10 largest cities, Philadelphia --  population 1.5 million -- has the worst homicide rate, with around 20 killings per 100,000 people, according to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports. Next on the list are Chicago and Houston. But Philadelphia's homicide rate pales in comparison with less-populated U.S. cities, including New Orleans -- which has 49.1 homicides per 100,000 people, St. Louis with 40.5 and Baltimore with 34.8, according to FBI data from 2010. Overall, the U.S. homicide rate is 6.9 times higher than other industrialized countries, and American homicides account for 80% of worldwide firearms deaths, according to a Journal of Trauma analysis of World Health Organization statistics for 2003. ""It's costing all of us. Whether it's immediately in front of your face or it's several miles away in another community. We are all connected, and it's affecting all of us,"" Kaz said. The city introduced new crime-fighting measures at the end of January, including a $20,000 reward for information that leads to solving homicides and $500 for locating illegal guns. Funding has been beefed up for a witness assistance program and increased police presence. But, so far, the mayhem hasn't let up. Mayor Michael Nutter has made it clear that the city is waging an all-out war against violent criminals. ""If you want to act like an idiot, if you want to be an a-hole, if you want to be a low-life in this town, we will track you down like the dog that you are,"" Nutter told CNN affiliate KYW in February.

""If 200 whales washed up on the shores of New Jersey, every scientist and biologist would come to find out why this was happening. But when it comes to 200 urban kids dying, nobody cares,"" Jones said. ""It's a new normal, and it's not acceptable. A Philadelphia native, Jones said he's saddened by the violence and lack of uniform action. ""We need more hands in this, more ideas and more resources,"" he said. ""Welcome to the struggle."" GunCrisis is committed because lives depend on finding a solution, MacMillan said. ""What happens next? We elevate the discourse. We bring people together. We build a movement. We stop the killing,"" he said. That's a major challenge for a city where murder has become routine.","Photojournalists launch website to fight Philadelphia gun violence .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal crashed to an early upset defeat at Wimbledon for the second year in a row as the fifth seed was sent packing in straight sets Monday by Belgian Steve Darcis in their first round match. Looking a shadow of the player who claimed a record eighth French Open title earlier this month, the Spaniard succumbed meekly 7-6 7-6 6-4 in a shade short of three hours on Court One. Last year he was beaten in the second round by Czech Lukas Rosol, the prelude to a lengthy injury layoff which saw him miss the London Olympics and the next two grand slams. Nadal only returned to the ATP circuit in February and has been in imperious form, winning seven titles, including the French Open. With the exception of a hard court tournament in the United States, only one of the events has been on a surface other than his favored clay. But coming into Wimbledon and despite his lack of preparation on grass, Nadal was rated among the favorites despite his lowly seeding. However, he has fallen at the first hurdle, beaten by the 29-year-old Darcis, who was securing the most notable victory of his career. Throughout the match, Nadal, who has a history of knee problems, appeared to be nursing an injury and looked slow and sluggish. After claiming the first two sets on tiebreaks, the second time after coming back from a break down to Nadal, Darcis made an early breakthrough to lead 2-0 in the third set. Nadal could make little impression on his service and Darcis duly served out for the match, clinching it with his 13th ace. ""Nobody was expecting my win today. I don't know what to say. I'm really happy,"" Darcis said after his unlikely triumph. ""OK, Nadal didn't play his best tennis, but I knew the first match on grass is always difficult. For me it is a big win. ""He lost early last year as well, but if you try to focus on him it is tougher. I try to focus on myself and I think I did great today."" Journeyman Darcis, who has been campaigning for most of 2013 on the second tier ATP Challenger Tour, had only previously reached the second round at Wimbledon in 2009. ""I always played good on grass, maybe not here because I had tough draws, but I have two wins against top 10 players on grass,"" he added. Nadal refused to use any possible injury as an excuse for his defeat, the first time he had lost in the opening round of a grand slam. ""It's not the right day (to talk about his knees) I tried my best in every moment, but it was not possible this afternoon,"" said Nadal. ""On grass, it's difficult to adapt when you don't have a chance to play on the surface before Wimbledon. Darcis deserved to win today."" Earlier, Nadal's arch rival Roger Federer breezed through the opening match of his bid for a record eighth Wimbledon crown -- then spared a thought for the ""influential and amazing"" Nelson Mandela, who is in critical condition in a Pretoria hospital. The defending champion dropped just five games in beating Victor Hanescu of Romania, finishing by taking the final set to love. ""There was just a bit of a breeze and it was cold. I'm happy to get out of there early and quickly. So it was a perfect day,"" was the Swiss maestro's initial verdict on a peerless performance in his opener. When asked about former South African president Mandela, Federer said he hoped the 94-year-old would make a recovery. ""He's been very influential, an amazing personality, you know, believed in something, had to pay a big price for it,"" he added. ""Someone you can definitely look up to and that's very important for me. Clearly there's many that come and go, but he has been there for a very long time and he's very much respected and loved."" In a 2011 global study of more than 50,000 people in 25 countries, Federer had been ranked second only to Mandela as a respected, admired and trusted personality. His mother Lynnette also hails from South Africa and he is a regular visitor to the country for charitable activities. Home hope Andy Murray also had an easy passage into the second round, easing past Benjamin Becker of Germany in straight sets, 6-4 6-3 6-2. In the final match of the day, Lleyton Hewitt of Australia rolled back the years to knock out 11th seed Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland. The champion 11 years ago beat the dangerous Wawrinka 6-4 7-5 6-3, showing a return to his best form after being dogged by injuries in recent years.","Rafael Nadal crashes to sensational first round defeat at Wimbledon .

"Forget selfies. Those are so 2013. Make way, instead, for a new way so show your handsome, or lovely, mug to the Internet -- a budding Web movement that combines high-tech geekery with the human desire to be seen. Call them ""dronies."" As personal drones find their way into more and more hands, folks have begun using the personal, unmanned aircraft, kitted out with video cameras, to add a little flare to the Internet's ubiquitous ""look at me"" self-shots. ""Let's be honest, selfies aren't going anywhere,""  said Alexandra Dao, a community development manager at video site Vimeo. ""But the dramatic reveal aspect adds another level of interest."" There may be no such thing as a ""dronie expert"" just yet. But Dao does claim the distinction of coining the term. About two months ago, she saw that a friend had commented on a video posted to the site by tech entrepreneur Amit Gupta. It was shot on San Francisco's Bernal Hill, starting with a closeup of Gupta and two friends, then panning up and out to show the San Fran skyline. The friend ""proclaimed it a new kind of shot,"" she said, ""and I jumped in with the suggestion of 'dronie'."" A few more dronies popped up the following day, leading Dao to begin collecting them on a new Vimeo channel. From there, it started the march to becoming a Web trend. A Web trend with a silly name? Sure. But, hey ... it's no ""owling."" iReport: Remote aerial photography . Twitter got into the action last month. At the Cannes Lions advertising festival in France, the social-media service garnered some free publicity using drones to create scenic Vine videos of employees with other festival attendees. The first was of ""Star Trek"" actor and social-media star Patrick Stewart, who appears in a new Twitter documentary. Twitter's not alone. As these things go, some early Web celebs are emerging in the dronie world. The Works family, Josh, Jessa and their son, Jack, sold all their stuff and took off on a permanent road trip in their Airstream bus in 2011. (Both parents have jobs that let them work from anywhere). They're documenting the trip with often stunning photos on Instagram and, somewhere along the way, got their own drone. Voila! The ""first family"" of dronies is born. There was the one three weeks ago from Camp Creek in Oregon, where the drone flies up to showcase the towering trees in the site's old-growth forest. Or their first, a vertigo-inducing zoom-out on Vance Creek Bridge in Washington, the second-highest built bridge in the United States. It remains to be seen whether dronies will become just another flash in the pan on the fast-twitch Web, or a more enduring Web presence like the venerable animated GIF. Dao says she's seeing some momentum. ""I've definitely noticed more interest in using drones for photography and filmmaking, even amongst my friends,"" she said. ""Drones just open up so many possibilities for interesting compositions and they're a lot more accessible than some of the professional equipment that filmmakers have had to use in the past to get these kinds of shots.""","A new breed of selfie -- the ""dronie"" -- is hitting the Web .

"(CNN) -- Think back over your favorite blockbusters this year. How many of them starred women in leading roles? Chances are, the answer is slim to none. In 2014, women led 18% of the year's 50 highest-grossing movies, according to a study by BoxOffice.com. For every Jennifer Lawrence in ""The Hunger Games,"" there's ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" and ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" -- all starring vehicles for (white) male actors. Unfortunately, this disparity is nothing new. Statistically speaking, male led films have trumped female led films for years. In 2013, men led 80% of the highest grossing movies released. The year before that, male actors dominated the box office by 84%. In 2011, it was by 88%. Yet it's still women who show up in theaters and fuel box office receipts. Last year, three out of five of the highest grossing films had female audiences that were higher than male audiences, according to data released by the Motion Picture Association of America. ""Hunger Games: Catching Fire,"" ""Despicable Me 2"" and ""Monsters University"" were the three highest grossing films of 2013 that skewed female.""Man of Steel"" and ""Iron Man 3"" were the two remaining films that attracted male audiences. Female film fans ""also drive ticket sales for movies that you wouldn't always expect,"" said Phil Contrino, vice president and chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. ""Opening weekend of 'World War Z,' for example, more women showed up to the theaters than men."" And women don't only represent in theaters; they're also largely behind the social media conversations that drive moviegoers to theaters. Susan Cartsonis, chairwoman at the Women in Film Foundation, said women are responsible for over 60% of messaging over social media. ""The female audience is a very enthusiastic, underserved audience. We go to see movies with our girlfriends, men and children and we want to tell everyone we know about it,"" Cartsonis said. These social media conversations are not just limited to your regular female moviegoer. Mindy Kaling and Elizabeth Banks spread the good word about ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" which was both male led and the No. 1 grossing movie in the 2014 box office. Both stars reached well over 1 million Twitter followers in their posting. So women will fill movie theaters and tweet with abandon in support of some of Hollywood's biggest films. But for some reason, Hollywood seems incapable of making movies about and starring women. There is no easy answer as to why that is, but filmmaker Paul Feig believes the problem lies in a lack of strong material for actresses. ""Women(-led) films don't make as much money internationally, but I've seen the material that's being generated for women and it's not that good,"" Feig said. ""It's just missing something character-wise."" Feig broke new ground with his 2011 hit comedy, ""Bridesmaids,"" which gained unprecedented attention from both men and women. The vision was simple: Round up some of the industry's funniest actresses and have them portray what it's like when different women are thrown together in a bridal party. Not only did it bring in a ton of money, but many credited it for making enduring headway for women in film. Feig does not completely agree. He said ""Bridesmaids"" opened the door, but not wide enough: ""There's still not enough roles for women in film and it's distressing."" Another issue is that the roles that do exist may just feed back into long-held gender stereotypes. As Kristen Wiig, a colleague of Feig's who co-wrote and starred in ""Bridesmaids,"" told CNN, women in film are moving in the right direction if they are not playing ""the nagging wife or the crazy neighbor."" There seems to be hope on the horizon. At the moment, there are two films gaining awards season buzz that are positioning themselves as a step in the right direction: Reese Witherspoon's ""Wild"" and Jennifer Aniston's ""Cake."" In ""Cake,"" Aniston stars as a woman suffering from chronic pain and emotional madness, pushing away the ones she loves the most. With ""Wild,"" Witherspoon plays an unstable, reckless character in search of light at the end of the tunnel after the death of her mother. ""I feel like the past few years we have seen less of these women on our screen,"" said ""Wild's"" producer Bruna Papandrea, who longs for strong, iconic characters like those in ""Thelma and Louise"" (1990) and ""Network"" (1976). ""Women are speaking up now for more of what they want to see and they are driving the social conversation."" But if we're ever going to truly close the gap between lead roles for men and women, it will have to be more than the audience demanding for it to happen. There would also need to be more filmmakers like Feig, who's made it blatantly clear that he sees no reason to constantly tell movies from a male point of view. For his upcoming ""Ghostbusters"" reboot, Feig has decided on a female cast, a decision that earned him criticism from skeptics. Despite the flak over social media, Feig said he ""just wants to level the playing field."" After all, he pointed out, ""the funniest people I know are women.""","Despite steps toward equality, women once again underrepresented on screen in 2014 .

"(CNN) -- Terrence Malick's next project, ""Knight of Cups,"" will apparently turn the filmmaker's lens on Hollywood itself. The first official trailer for the drama arrived online this week as ""Knight of Cups"" prepares to bow at the 2015 Berlin Film Festival. The movie was written and directed by Malick, and stars Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett and Natalie Portman. The plot has been kept largely under wraps, except for the vague understanding that it focuses on ""celebrities and excess."" The new two-minute trailer doesn't exactly expand on that concept, but it does give us a clearer picture of what to expect. We now know that Bale plays a man named Rick, who's adrift in life and has evidently lost his sense of self while becoming trapped in life's ""excesses."" Judging from the dialogue in the trailer, it isn't a stretch to imagine that the movie's set in the bubble of Hollywood: ""See the palm trees? They tell you anything's possible,"" says one voice. ""No one cares about reality anymore,"" chimes in another. The ""Knight of Cups"" clip also comes with an official synopsis, but it's as ethereally abstract as the trailer itself. ""Once there was a young prince whose father, the king of the East, sent him down into Egypt to find a pearl. But when the prince arrived, the people poured him a cup. Drinking it, he forgot he was the son of a king, forgot about the pearl and fell into a deep sleep,"" the description says. ""Rick's father used to read this story to him as a boy. The road to the East stretches out before him. Will he set forth?"" Malick's ""Knight of Cups"" is set to open in the U.S. in 2015.","The first trailer for ""Knight of Cups"" has arrived .

"A video that appears to show a Saudi man beating a migrant worker is causing growing outrage in Saudi Arabia. In the amateur video, which went viral after it was posted on YouTube, a male worker in an orange jumpsuit is first seen sitting on a floor, scared and submissive. A man who government officials believe is Saudi begins tormenting the victim, angry because he thinks the worker has spoken to his wife. ""Why did you come here when she was here?"" he asks in what sounds like Saudi-accented Arabic. ""I swear I didn't mean it,"" pleads the man, who from his clothes and accent appears to be a migrant laborer, adding, ""I swear to God I didn't know."" The abuser begins slapping his victim as he continues questioning him, demanding to know why the worker would dare contact his wife. Officials aren't sure where it happened, but they're looking into it. Women who defied Saudi driving ban fear repercussions . The Saudi government-backed Human Rights Commission has condemned the video, telling CNN it launched an immediate investigation. ""We are taking this very seriously and are looking into it with Saudi security,"" said the commission's Mohammed Al-Madi. ""We are doing our utmost to ensure the accused abuser is arrested and tried. We are also doing everything we can to find the abused man, so that we can help him in any way."" CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video, but another Saudi government-backed human rights group, the National Society for Human Rights, is also investigating. ""We don't know where it took place, but it is under investigation and we'll release details in a few days' time,"" said Mifleh Al-Qahtani, president of the society. As awful as the incident captured on video is, it is not an isolated one. Global human rights groups have documented widespread abuse of migrant workers in Saudi Arabia. According to Human Rights Watch, there are ""over nine million migrant workers in Saudi Arabia -- more than half the work force."" In July, the rights group issued a statement saying that ""many suffer multiple abuses and labor exploitation, sometimes amounting to slavery-like conditions."" The group added: ""The kafala, or sponsorship, system ties migrant workers' residency permits to 'sponsoring' employers, whose written consent is required for workers to change employers or leave the country. Employers often abuse this power in violation of Saudi law to confiscate passports, withhold wages and force migrants to work against their will or on exploitative terms."" Human Rights Watch Saudi researcher Adam Coogle said that ""Saudi Arabia needs to get serious about protecting migrant workers by providing adequate avenues to justice and mechanisms of redress."" Saudi preacher sentenced to 8 years, 600 lashes for killing 5-year-old daughter . The sponsorship system isn't limited to Saudi Arabia -- migrant laborers throughout the Middle East face similar problems. ""Nobody can come into the Arab states or in the Middle East without a sponsor,"" says Azfar Khan, with the International Labor Organization. According to Khan, many migrant workers are asked to surrender their passports upon entering countries in the Middle East, which can make them vulnerable to abuse. ""When the employer has that kind of power, then they can dictate the working conditions,"" explains Khan. ""Whether it's a question of the wage rates, whether it's a question of the work time."" Adds Khan, ""what is lacking in the Middle East and many of these countries is that the workers don't have representation."" Rights activists say it's a huge problem that's only getting worse -- this latest case being a prime example. Toward the end of the video, the real brutality begins. ""Sit down! Kneel down!"" yells the Saudi man, as he begins to flog the victim with a belt. Standing above him, the Saudi man also repeatedly slaps and kicks the worker. The screams of ""no"" are bloodcurdling. Before the end of the nearly two-minute video, the Saudi man asks the worker if he wants to die. Many are asking if the beating went on and what happened to the victim afterward. Apparently, like the fate of so many abused and forgotten foreign workers, for now, hardly anyone knows. 4 Saudi men accused of dancing naked sentenced to prison, lashes .","Amateur video apparently shows a Saudi man berating and beating a migrant worker .

"(CNN) -- Already boasting a treasure trove of trophies and mementos, the latest addition to Cristiano Ronaldo's own personal museum is a 10-foot bronze statue of the man himself. The ""CR7 Museum"" -- opened in December 2013 in the Real Madrid attacker's hometown of Funchal, on the Portuguese island of Madeira -- houses more than 125 awards, including the two Ballon d'Or titles he won in 2008 and 2013 after being voted the world's best player. And now standing outside to greet those fans who make the pilgrimage to pay homage to one of football's greats is a mammoth sculpture of the Portugal captain in all his glory. Ronaldo, fresh from helping Madrid lift FIFA's Club World Cup in Morocco on Saturday, was in Funchal just 24 hours later to unite with his family for the statue's official unveiling. ""I feel so proud to be honored with a statue in Madeira,"" Ronaldo wrote on his official Twitter account. ""It's a huge joy to share this moment with my family and the people from Madeira.

"(CNN) -- Curiouser and curiouser! A cat's head floats across the stage. A white snake orbits it, buoyed and silently guided by a troupe of dancers hidden in darkness of black cloth. The Cheshire cat's head is joined on stage by its paws and body and the snake is revealed as its tail. The animal marches, Chinese-dragon like, up and down the wide stage of the Royal Opera House. Breaking decades of tradition, the Royal Ballet has been running a full-length commission of ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" since 2011, replacing the Nutcracker as the mainstay of London's Christmas dance season. Theater designer Bob Crowley goes beyond faithfully rendering Lewis Carroll's original story into dance scenes, but uses plenty of his own smoke and mirrors -- sometimes literally -- to create breathtaking stage craft. Curtains on strings and projected light conjure the illusion of Alice collapsing and expanding in height; huge paper boats float over a sea of draped dancers; enormous towers of cards are erected and collapsed; and the myriad hidden horrors behind the innocuous looking home sweet home are revealed with brio. Christopher Wheeldon's choreography left children and adults alike stunned on Saturday's opening night, the first of a sell out run that rolls through to January, all the more impressive when you consider he had to silently communicate a book so replete with puns, riddles and invented words. The purple-dressed protagonist skittishly twirls through a waltz of dancing flowers as two lines of dancers emerge from the back of the all gold and velvet hall, donning gigantic colorful meringue hats and bounding down the aisles. Ensconced within home sweet home a scene of complete mayhem emerges: a fiery butcher's shop staffed with malevolence. Alice dances around the mad proprietor's bloodied cleaver, snipping strings of sausages and escaping into the lush green countryside within an inch of her life. Zenaida Yanowsky as The Queen of Hearts stole the show, most of which she spent being pushed around in a heart-shaped cherry-red carriage by a squad of red cavaliers, reprimanding her minions and sowing chaos wherever she went. Once off her wheels, she was repeatedly disturbed from her graceful dance by the clumsy mistakes of a group of dancing fools. She pushes one over, threatens another with decapitation before dancing flat onto her back, legs akimbo in a huge swirl of red tutu. Alas, you may have to wait till next year but there is real magic within the walls of Royal Opera House at Christmastime in London.

"(CNN) -- Taiwan's government has threatened legal action after one of its taekwondo athletes was disqualified at the Asian Games in China. Olympic bronze medallist Yang Shu-chun was leading during a match in the women's 49 kilogram division on Tuesday when it was halted due to claims she had used extra electronic sensors in her socks. Taiwan's minister of sports affairs, Tai Hsia-ling, told reporters in Guangzhou that the island would take the case to the International Court of Justice unless it received ""a reasonable answer"" from the Asian Taekwondo Union, the Tapei-based Central News Agency reported. CNA said that Taiwan's Premier Wu Den-yih asked Tai's office to question the fairness of the ruling. Yang, who led Vietnamese opponent Vu Thi Hau 9-0 when the match was halted, was left in tears after the decision and a subsequent appeal to World Taekwondo Federation was rejected, the Taipei Times reported. ""This was an extremely unfair decision. I don't know what was wrong. All of my electronic protective equipment followed official specifications,"" she said on Wednesday. ""I brought two pairs of WTF-certified socks with me. The Chinese examiner asked me to scrap the first pair, but the second pair passed the examination. ""Before the start of [yesterday's] bout, the chief judge carefully examined all the equipment on my body and did not raise any questions."" Coach Liu Yung-lung said: ""Even though the model was different, the judge did not find fault with it before the bout. If the judge had brought up the problem at the start, Yang Shu-chun could have changed her socks. ""This was negligence on the part of the organizers. Individual athletes should not have to pay for the authorities' problems."" Meanwhile, China leads the medal table after day five with 97 golds and 172 overall. South Korea was second with 29 golds ahead of Japan (17), North Korea and Iran (both five) and Taiwan (four). China won the team tennis title for the first time in 24 years, beating defending champions South Korea 2-1 thanks to victories by Wimbledon semifinalist Li Na and Peng Shuai. South Korean swimmer Park Tae-Hwan claimed his third freestyle gold of the week, adding the 100m title to his earlier victories in the 200m and 400m distances. The 21-year-old Olympic 400m champion, who won a record seven medals in Doha four years ago, collected his fifth medal of the week. China, however, have taken 22 out of a possible 32 golds going into the final day in the pool, with Tang Li claiming her fourth title with victory in the women's 100m freestyle.","Martial artist Yang Shu-chun disqualified at Asian Games for having illegal socks .

"When Vice President Joe Biden and Defense Secretary Robert Gates advised President Barack Obama in late April 2011 that sending a Navy SEAL team into Pakistan to capture or kill Osama bin Laden was not worth the various risks that this operation entailed, John Brennan, the president's top counterterrorism adviser, urged the president to authorize the raid. It's that kind of call that has made Brennan the president's go-to guy since the beginning of Obama's first term on all matters related to terrorism and has also thrust him into a broader policymaking role in the Middle East and in South Asia. From his windowless office deep in the bowels of the West Wing a few steps from the Situation Room, Brennan has been at the center of every important decision in the war against al Qaeda. Brennan is a serious, taciturn man who grew up in New Jersey and attended Fordham University in New York, where at one point he contemplated becoming a priest. Instead, he joined the CIA and spent more than two decades in the shadows, rising to take on important positions such as Bill Clinton's intelligence briefer and CIA station chief in Saudi Arabia. Three years after 9/11, Brennan became the first director of the National Counterterrorism Center, which shapes overall strategy against al Qaeda and its allies across the 16 agencies of the U.S. intelligence community. After he retired, Brennan went into the private sector, where he played an early role in advising the Obama campaign in the run-up to the 2008 election. It's this long history with Obama and his depth of experience in the intelligence community that have made Brennan the president's pick to run the CIA. Facing tough questions . On Thursday, Brennan will testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee, a milestone on the road to what is shaping up to be a contentious confirmation to be CIA director. At his confirmation hearing, Brennan will be asked some tough questions about the administration's policies on CIA drone strikes, policies that he has played a key role in formulating. Taking even the most conservative estimate of casualties during Brennan's time as Obama's top counterterrorism adviser, CIA drone strikes in Pakistan have killed 1,577 people, 143 of whom were identified in credible news reports as civilians, according to a count by the New America Foundation. Brennan will also likely be asked to discuss the still-classified Senate Intelligence Committee's three-year investigation into the CIA detainee program and the extent to which coercive interrogations of some of those CIA-held prisoners elicited useful information. The head of the committee, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, has said that coercive interrogations did not provide key leads in tracking down bin Laden, while a number of retired senior CIA officials have claimed that they did. Undoubtedly, this discrepancy will be something that the committee will want to delve into with Brennan. Opinion: Bring drones out of the shadows . Role in the raid . Perhaps more than any other official, he played a key role in what has surely been the Obama administration's greatest success overseas: tracking bin Laden to an obscure city in Pakistan and then formulating the overall plan that led to the death of al Qaeda's leader. In August 2010, CIA Director Leon Panetta went to the White House to brief the president and a handful of his top national security advisers, including Brennan, that the CIA had a promising lead that suggested bin Laden could be living in a compound in the northern city of Abbottabad. The case that bin Laden was living there was entirely circumstantial and was based on the fact that residing at the Abbottabad compound was a longtime al Qaeda insider and that he and the other people living in the compound were taking elaborate measures to deceive their neighbors about their identities. One of the mysterious residents at the compound was a man who never left the compound's grounds and could be seen by U.S. satellites occasionally taking a quick walk in the garden. He would come to be nicknamed ""the pacer."" However, the CIA could never get a photograph of the pacer's face, nor was there any other definitive intelligence that bin Laden was living at the compound. Brennan, who had spent almost all of his working life at the CIA, met regularly with the analysts working on the bin Laden case. According to senior White House officials, Brennan pushed the analysts to come up with intelligence that disproved the notion that bin Laden was living in the Abbottabad compound, explaining, ""I'm tired of hearing why everything you say confirms your case. What we need to look for are the things that tell us what's not right about our theory. So what's not right about your inferences?"" The analysts working on the bin Laden hunt came back to the White House one day and started their intelligence update, saying, ""Looks like there's a dog on the compound."" Denis McDonough, Obama's then-deputy national security adviser, remembers thinking, ""Oh, that's a bummer. You know, no self-respecting Muslim's gonna have a dog."" (Many Muslims believe dogs to be ""unclean."") Brennan, who had spent much of his career focused on the Middle East and speaks Arabic, pointed out that bin Laden, in fact, did have dogs when he was living in Sudan in the mid-1990s. (Indeed, when al Qaeda's leader was living in the capital of Khartoum, he had taken an interest in training police dogs.) Report: Numerous countries involved in CIA interrogation programs . Creation of the ""Red Team"" In addition to pushing the CIA to refine its analysis of the case that bin Laden was living in Abbottabad, two weeks before Obama made the final decision to launch the Navy SEAL raid, Brennan authorized the formation of a ""Red Team."" It was made up of four intelligence analysts who had had no prior role in making the case that bin Laden was living in Abbottabad. The role of the Red Team was to see if there were alternative explanations that could explain the ""pattern of life"" of the mysterious residents of the Abbottabad compound. For instance: Could they be the retinue of some drug lord who was keeping a low profile? Or might they be on the fringes of al Qaeda but unrelated to bin Laden himself? On Thursday, April 28, 2011, during the final National Security Council meeting to discuss what to do in Abbottabad, the Red Team briefed the president and his top advisers. One of the Red Team analysts put the odds that bin Laden was living in Abbottabad at 40%, which was discomfiting to some. Brennan recalls: ""Some of us thought, 'Whoa! We thought the prospects were higher that he was in there.' And the president recognized that when people were saying, 'Well, there's only 40% of a chance,' that some people were going to get a little bit soft on this."" Was it too risky? The uncertainty that bin Laden was even living in Abbottabad contributed to the advice that Biden and Gates gave Obama during this final National Security Council meeting: Don't authorize the SEAL team raid. It's just too risky. By now, Brennan had come to a very different conclusion. He had already told the president privately the CIA officials who had developed the intelligence on Abbottabad were ""the people that have been following bin Laden for 15 years. This has been their life's work, this has been their life's journey, and they feel it very much in their gut that bin Laden is at that compound. I feel pretty good, if not certain, that bin Laden is at that compound."" Brennan urged a go on the raid. As the SEAL raid unfolded in Abbottabad on May 1, 2011, Brennan was as anxious as anyone else in the White House Situation Room: ""Might there be a quick reaction force that bin Laden may have had, security that we didn't know about?"" he recalled thinking. The raid, of course, succeeded. When photos of the dead Osama bin Laden were passed around the Situation Room, Brennan nodded and said, ""It's bin Laden.""","John Brennan is up for a confirmation hearing before the Senate on Thursday .

"(CNN) -- A terminally ill college basketball player in Ohio will get a chance to make her dreams come true Sunday with her first college game. Lauren Hill's first game may be her last one. The 19-year-old freshman at Mount Saint Joseph University was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2013. Her diagnosis came during her final year of high school. A few weeks before she found out, she'd signed up to play basketball at Mount Saint Joseph. Undeterred, she played ball in high school despite rounds of chemotherapy for her inoperable tumor, CNN affiliate WKRC reported. ""I never gave up for a second even when I got a terminal diagnosis; never thought about sitting back and not living life anymore,"" she told the affiliate. After doctors told her she doesn't have much time left, the university asked the NCAA if it can move its season opener by two weeks to November 2, according to the affiliate. The answer was yes. Hill will join her new teammates for her first college game against Hiram College. She plans to wear her No. 22 jersey. Support for Hill poured in ahead of the game from a few high-profile sports fans, including from Cincinnati Bengals. .","NCAA grants dying teen's wish .

"New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez said Wednesday that she plans a new push to repeal the state law allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses. Martinez, who has tried to get the law repealed twice before, described it as dangerous in a post on her official Facebook page. ""I am once again asking the legislature to repeal the law that gives driver's licenses to illegal immigrants,"" said Martinez, a Republican. ""I am always willing to discuss this issue with legislators from both parties and explore ways to find common ground, but I believe the most effective solution is to simply repeal this dangerous law."" Her comments are the latest salvo in a nationwide debate over the controversial issue. Some were hopeful that the nod toward compromise was a sign that her approach may have changed from past attempts to repeal the measure. Opinion: Solve immigration without a quick path to citizenship . ""We are encouraged that a compromise can be worked out by the legislators and the governor,"" said Allen Sanchez, executive director of the New Mexico Conference of Catholic Bishops, a group that has fought the governor's attempts to repeal the law. Martinez, the first Latina governor in the United States, promoted the repeal of the 2003 law during her campaign for governor. In 2011, she said the law had turned New Mexico into a magnet for people from other states seeking a license. ""We have created an industry of human trafficking,"" Martinez said in 2011. ""People are getting paid to bring other people from all over the country to New Mexico for the whole purpose of defrauding our state."" New Mexico and Washington are the only two states that grant unrestricted driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants. Utah issues driving privilege cards to undocumented immigrants who have lived in the state for more than six months.  Illinois lawmakers approved a measure earlier this month to allow undocumented immigrants to get temporary licenses. Several New Mexico lawmakers have said this month that they were considering a measure that would be a compromise more in line with the approach Utah and Illinois have taken, CNN affiliate KRQE reported. ""It doesn't benefit the citizens of the state of New Mexico for us to be at a stalemate."" Democratic state Sen. Pete Campos told KRQE.  ""It is important for us to move forward."" For months, driver's licenses and other state benefits have been at the heart of a battle in the nationwide immigration debate. In New Mexico, supporters of the licenses for undocumented immigrants argue that it's safer to have more drivers trained and insured, and opponents argue that it's a system rife with fraud. Immigrant rights advocates have defended the current practice. It was intended to offer undocumented immigrants ""the opportunity to buy insurance, register their vehicles and have a driving record available to all law enforcement,"" said Marcela Diaz of Somos Un Pueblo Unido (We Are a United People). Opinion: DREAMers are pushing their luck . But critics say the practice is turning New Mexico into a magnet for fraud. ""Currently, illegal immigrants from all over the country come to New Mexico to obtain a license without having the intention of staying here,"" Demesia Padilla, the state's secretary of taxation and revenue, said in 2011. The state's Taxation and Revenue department has prosecuted a number of people, including Rosa Pardo-Marrufo, who confessed in 2009 to charging $700 to people who wanted to use her address in fraudulent applications.","Martinez: ""I believe the most effective solution is to simply repeal this dangerous law""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British Big Brother star Jade Goody is fast-tracking plans to get married after being told doctors cannot cure her cancer. British Big Brother star Jade Goody has been diagnosed with terminal cancer. Goody, 27, only has months to live after her cervical cancer spread to her liver, bowel and groin, the British Press Association reported. She sprung into the spotlight during her first appearance in the Big Brother house in 2002, before going on to launch a range of her own products and host television shows. Goody's return to the house in 2007, on the celebrity edition of the show, ended in ignominy, after her taunting of Bollywood star Shilpa Shetty outraged viewers and resulted in more than 40,000 complaints. However, in August 2008 she accepted an offer to go on the Indian version of Big Brother. Two days into that she was diagnosed with cervical cancer and left the house. Goody's spokesman, Max Clifford, told PA that Goody was ""devastated"" and was working to put her legal affairs in order. She has two sons, Bobby, five, and Freddie, four, and has told British media that she wants to leave them financially secure. Her boyfriend, Jack Tweed, had proposed at her hospital bedside, Clifford said. Goody, in a wheelchair, was seen in London on Sunday shopping for a dress.","British Big Brother star Jade Goody has been told she has terminal cancer .

"Illinois is poised to become the 15th state to allow same-sex marriage after legislation passed both houses of the state's General Assembly on Tuesday. The bill now goes to Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn, who has said he will sign it. The passage of the legislation ""put our state on the right side of history,"" Quinn said. President Obama also hailed the vote in his home state, saying he has ""always believed that gay and lesbian Americans should be treated fairly and equally under the law. ""Over time, I also came to believe that same-sex couples should be able to get married like anyone else,"" he said. ""As I said in my Inaugural Address last January, our journey as a nation is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law, for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well,"" the President added. The law would take effect on June 1, 2014. Illinois previously offered civil unions, but not marriage, to same-sex couples. In addition to Illinois, same-sex marriage is legal in 14 states -- California, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington -- as well as the District of Columbia. Colorado and Hawaii allow civil unions. Same-sex marriage is banned in every state not mentioned above, except for New Mexico, which has no laws banning or allowing it. Same-sex marriage fast facts . Hawaii could become the next state to legalize same-sex marriage. Its Senate passed a bill in October, kicking it to the House, which is expected to vote soon. Proponents of same-sex marriage say they have momentum on their side. In June, the Supreme Court rejected parts of the Defense of Marriage Act in a 5-4 decision, dismissing an appeal over same-sex marriage on jurisdictional grounds and ruling same-sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits. It also ruled that private parties do not have ""standing"" to defend California's voter-approved ballot measure barring gay and lesbians couples from state-sanctioned wedlock, clearing the way for same-sex marriages in California to resume. But opponents say the fight is far from over. Shortly before the Illinois votes, the president of the National Organization for Marriage urged people to contact their state representatives to tell them they support marriage as the union of one man and one woman. ""We've seen how marriage redefinition leads to those who believe in traditional marriage being punished, labeled 'bigots' and 'haters' in the public square, and forced to be silent about their deeply held beliefs or face repercussions. And their children? They're taught in schools that the values planted in them at home are bigoted and outdated, the equivalent of racism!"" Brian Brown wrote in a blog post. Worldwide, 16 other countries (and parts of Mexico) also have laws allowing same-sex marriage and domestic partnerships.

"(CNN) -- Former Real Madrid star Alfredo Di Stefano, widely regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time, has died at the age of 88. A statement published on the La Liga team's website confirmed that di Stefano had passed away Monday at Madrid's General Universitario Gregorio Maranon. ""Real Madrid president Florentino Perez and the club's board of directors would like to express their deepest condolences and their love and affection towards his children, friends and family,"" the club's statement read. ""Real Madrid extends these condolences to all the Madridistas of the world and those who feel the loss of the best player of all time."" Honorary president of the Spanish giants since 2000, Di Stefano was admitted to hospital on Saturday after suffering a heart attack near Madrid's Bernabeu Stadium. Born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Di Stefano led Los Blancos to five consecutive European Cup triumphs from 1956 to 1960 and was named European Footballer of the Year twice in 1957 and 1959. He was equally successful in domestic football, winning eight Spanish league titles and one Copa del Rey. Real's Perez is due to make a further statement at the Bernabeu later on Monday, the club's Website said. Remarkably Di Stefano played at international level for three nations but never appeared at the World Cup. He won six caps for Argentina and played four times for Colombia, though his Colombian caps are not recognized by world governing body FIFA. In 1957, FIFA gave Di Stefano permission to play for Spain after he gained Spanish citizenship and the Real star went to win 31 caps for La Roja. Former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was among the many leading figures in the game to pay tribute to Di Stefano, saying he was ""very sad"" to hear the news. ""The great question that always comes up is who are the greatest players,"" Ferguson told Sky Sports News. ""Obviously there is a list of great ones like (Johan) Cruyff, (Diego) Maradona and Pele and of course (Ferenc) Puskas and of course Di Stefano -- I thought he was one of the greatest in my mind. ""He had a fantastic balance and poise.

"Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum is running as the ""authentic conservative"" in the Republican primaries. As his campaign has gained steam moving into the Michigan and Arizona contests, the entire tenor of the Republican debate has changed dramatically. Social and cultural issues are front and center once again. Whereas candidates had spent months railing against President Obama as a big-government liberal and talking about the weak economy and deficits, over the past two weeks they have plunged back into the culture wars, making provocative statements about contraception, religion, gender relations and more. In response to media reports about Santorum's comments in 2008, in which he said, ""Satan is attacking the great institutions of America,"" Santorum responded, ""I will defend everything I say."" Santorum's hope is that social conservatism can offer the path toward a Republican victory, by highlighting a set of issues that can bring the conservative coalition together. As former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney continues to be pummeled for his flip-flopping on key issues, his wealth, and his background in the private sector, Santorum hopes that he can create a bridge between the Republican right and disaffected blue-collar workers -- the so-called Reagan Democrats -- through social issues that cut across class lines. The strategy plays into a conventional argument about how Republicans can succeed with voters whose economic interests are better served by the Democrats, namely through focusing on social and cultural issues that shift attention in a different direction. This is a risky bet for the GOP and a positive development for the administration and congressional Democrats. While most successful Republican presidential candidates have paid lip service to social conservatism in the last three decades, the truth is it has never been an issue through which Republicans have been able to build successful   coalitions that can win at the polls and get bills passed. Currently, polls show that the public is not in favor of many of the positions espoused by the right when it comes to culture. According to a poll by CBS and The New York Times, 66% supported the administration's plan to require private health insurance to cover birth control and 61% said yes with regard to religiously affiliated employers; Catholics supported the administration 61% to 31%.  In 2011, Gallup found that a majority of Americans supported the legalization of same-sex marriage. A number of factors other than social conservatism have been responsible for propelling Republicans into the White House. In some cases, Republicans have been able to build broad coalitions when the economy is growing and some of the economic tensions that might otherwise play to the policies of Democrats are muted. In 1984, for example, President Ronald Reagan could boast that it was ""morning in America"" again as the impact of the recession was diminishing. In 2000, the continued strength of the high-tech economy allowed Texas Gov. George W. Bush to include economic policies that would benefit the wealthy -- such as a regressive tax cut -- within an agenda of compassionate conservatism that would assist marginalized Americans. The other way in which Republican candidates have been able to expand their electoral coalition is through appeals based on national security. Claiming that Republicans are tougher on defense has been a way to attract voters whose economic interests fit more easily with the policies of Democrats. President George H.W. Bush did this in 1988 with a devastating campaign that portrayed Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis as a timid liberal who would not stand up to the Soviet Union. In 2004, his son used similar tactics to portray Sen. John Kerry as a Vietnam War-protesting vet who would not take the needed steps to defeat terrorism. In 1980, aided by a weakened economy, Reagan attacked President Jimmy Carter as impotent and ineffective overseas. The former California governor used the Iranian hostage crisis and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan as evidence that Republicans were needed to revive America's international standing. While all of these Republicans certainly paid lip service to social conservatism, those issues were always a limited part of their campaigns and even less important once Republicans were in power. In this election, Republicans will probably not have any of the other factors that have been so pivotal. If the economy is stronger, one of their central critiques about Obama will not be nearly as effective. Without a major national security crisis -- and after Obama undercut some of the hawkish clamor of the GOP with the killing of Osama bin Laden and several other key figures in al Qaeda -- Republicans won't have national security to hold them together again. Santorum and his supporters think that social conservatism is the answer. The other Republican candidates, seeking to steal his thunder, have joined the move rightward in recent days. The president could not ask for much more, as he and his advisers watch the Republican primaries disintegrate into a Republican civil war. Republicans are refocusing the national debate on a set of questions that has little track record as a winning theme, and they have effectively moved the debate away from the president and his vulnerabilities and toward questions about whether the GOP is too extreme. For Obama, it might actually be morning in America again.","Zelizer: Rick Santorum's rise in the polls has changed nature of GOP race .

"(CNN) -- Frank Lowe's 5-year-old son may not be able to write his name yet, but he can tell you if your shoes are ratchet. OK, that's not really true, but it's funny, which is the point of Lowe's Twitter persona, @GayAtHomeDad: to use humor to normalize the concept of gay parenting and show mainstream America that ""gay is OK."" ""I think when people are uncertain or uncomfortable about something, humor is the best way to break down some of those barriers, and gay parenting is definitely a new concept to a lot of people,"" he said. Not long ago, Lowe was a fairly normal gay man working in fashion. Then he moved to Connecticut with his partner, adopted their son, Briggs, and became a stay-at-home dad.

Lowe launched the Twitter persona in 2012 in response to what he perceived as ""a significant lack"" of gay fathers in the media and pop culture, except for Cam and Mitchell on ""Modern Family."" To riff on the gay dad stereotype, he started @GayAtHomeDad as both a ""self-deprecating joke"" and a way to encourage gay youth to be comfortable in their skin. It took off, thanks to the compelling username and outlandish comments such as ""When my kid scrapes his knee, he gets a Prada Band-Aid,"" or ""As IF I'm going to ruin his hair using s****y tears-free shampoo. He can cry."" ""I thought 'what's funnier than an outlandishly crazy, lewd gay dad?' and literally there's nothing,"" he said. He also wants to put out the message to the gay community that being a gay parent doesn't mean you have to be a perfect parent. ""Gay parents are expected to behave a certain way, because heaven forbid we mess this up, and I think that's bulls***. I am definitely a lot more cautious now that I'm a parent, but I still am the same person I was before having a kid.""

"In two operations nearly 3,000 miles apart, U.S. military forces went after two high-value targets over the weekend. And while officials have yet to say whether the operations were coordinated or directly related, they show Washington's reach, capability and willingness to pursue alleged terrorists. One operation took place Saturday in the Libyan capital of Tripoli, when U.S. forces captured Abu Anas al Libi, an al Qaeda leader wanted for his role in the deadly 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa. As al Libi was leaving his house for morning prayers, a group of 10 masked men surprised him, a source close to Libyan intelligence said. Citing al Libi's wife, the source said the al Qaeda leader tried to reach into his car to grab his gun -- but the U.S. forces quickly snatched him. In the second raid, a team of  U.S. Navy SEALs in southern Somalia targeted the top leader of Al-Shabaab, which was behind last month's mall attack in Kenya. The SEALs came under fire and had to withdraw before they could confirm whether they killed their target, a senior U.S. official said. ""One could have gone without the other,"" said retired Lt. Col. Rick Francona, CNN's military analyst. ""But the fact that they did them both, I think, is a real signal that the United States -- no matter how long it takes -- will go after these targets."" The operations were carried out even as polls show Americans are skittish about U.S. military involvement in overseas conflicts. This means, Francona said, that others who might be in the U.S. government's cross hairs could have more reason to worry. Speaking to reporters at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Bali, Indonesia, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the raids ought to make clear that the United States ""will never stop in its effort to hold those accountable who conduct acts of terror."" ""Those members of al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations literally can run,"" he said, ""but they can't hide."" Al Libi tied to U.S. embassy bombings . Al Libi, 49, has been high on the radar for years. He was on the FBI's ""Most Wanted Terrorists"" list, with a $5 million reward for information leading to his arrest or conviction. He is alleged to have played a key role in the August 7, 1998, bombings of American embassies in Nairobi, Kenya; and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. More than 200 people were killed and another 5,000 wounded in the Kenya attack; 11 died in the Tanzania incident. Al Libi has been indicted on charges of conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals, murder, destruction of American buildings and government property, and destruction of national defense utilities of the United States. As early as December 2010, Libyan authorities told a United Nations committee that al Libi was living there, even providing a Tripoli address for him. U.S. officials wanted al Libi to face trial in an American court. But, counterterrorism analysts told CNN, he may not have been apprehended because of the delicate security situation in much of Libya. There, ex-jihadists -- especially those who once belonged to the Libyan Islamic Fighters Group -- held considerable sway since the ouster of longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi. The Saturday operation was conducted with the knowledge of the Libyan government, said one U.S. official. The Pentagon said the U.S. military was holding him in a ""secure location"" outside Libya. ""It's a huge deal to get him,"" said CNN's Nic Robertson, who has long been covering al Qaeda. ""He's a big player in al Qaeda (and) he is in one of the key target areas, the north of Africa."" Beyond any psychological impact on the terrorist group, al Libi's capture could potentially yield a wealth of information about al Qaeda's plans and capabilities. The terrorist network has shown particular strength of late in Africa. ""Clearly, he may have useful information about the strength of al Qaeda and the Islamists in Libya,"" Robertson said. ""He is somebody who is senior within al Qaeda. He was well respected, a good operative."" Al-Shabaab blamed for Kenya mall attack . Al-Shabaab long has been a target of Washington as well: It was designated a foreign terrorist organization in  2008. The group is seeking to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state, though it has carried out attacks in other African countries as well. The attack on Nairobi's Westgate Mall on September 21 thrust Al-Shabaab into the spotlight once again. Washington vowed to support Kenya's government after the bloody raid, which killed at least 67 people. The Al-Shabaab raid took place before dawn Saturday (late Friday night ET) in the southern Somalian port city of Barawe. The Pentagon would only say the operation was against a ""known Al-Shabaab terrorist."" But town residents told CNN  the ""foreign forces"" came via speed boat and stormed a house believed to be a hideout for several top militant commanders, including the group's top leader Ahmed abdi Godane, also known as Moktar Ali Zubeyr. A senior U.S. official said the Navy SEALs inflicted some Al-Shabaab casualties, and came under fire. They made the ""prudent decision"" to withdraw, and couldn't confirm whether they killed their target, the official said. Abdiaziz Abu Musab, an Al-Shabaab spokesman, said at least one Al-Shabaab fighter was killed in the gunfight.  But no U.S. personnel were injured or killed, a U.S. official said. In recent months, Al-Shabaab's haven in south-central Somalia has been been increasingly squeezed as Kenyan forces fight the group from the south and African Union forces come down from Mogadishu. At the same time, Al-Shabaab has become even more closely aligned with al Qaeda. The two groups effectively merged last year, said CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen. ""This is a group that has adopted al Qaeda's ideology wholesale,"" Bergen said. ""The reason they attacked the mall was not only because it was Kenyan, but also because it attracted a fair number of Western businessmen and others living in Nairobi.""

"(CNN) -- Under Christmas trees around the world, parcels of underpants and bundles of briefs are waiting to be opened -- perhaps with a tinge of dismay -- by the men in your life. Underwear is a big hitter on the traditional holiday gift list and now soccer stars are muscling into the market. Colombian World Cup star James Rodriguez became the latest footballer to tackle branded underwear, launching his J10 collection for Bronzini last month and posing semi-naked to show off the goods on offer. The 23-year-old was following the lead of his Portuguese Real Madrid teammate Cristiano Ronaldo, whose CR7 underwear label recently celebrated its one-year anniversary. David Beckham's pants hit high streets in close to 40 countries when the former LA Galaxy and Manchester United maestro teamed up with Swedish fashion store H&M in 2012. Even though he is approaching 40 -- that's 17 years older than undies rival Rodriguez -- Beckham stripped off again this summer to model his wares. But why do footballers choose to branch out their brand in the most intimate way? ""Christmas comes round once a year but footballers are in the shop window continually,"" Steve Martin, the global CEO for brand agency M&C Saatchi Sport and Entertainment, told CNN. ""Underwear is an every day purchase and wearing the right underwear has seen it become something of a lifestyle item. ""For some of the major players, it's a natural extension of their individual brand. ""They don't need the money. It's not about greed but it is about making the most of their true value over the short period of their career."" Martin helps manage the branding and marketing for Ronaldo's CR7 range, which he says is available in almost 100 countries -- its main markets are in southern Europe, Asia and South America -- as well as online. Read more: Ronaldo immortalized in bronze statue . Ronaldo's luxury trunks cost $36 a pair with the briefs priced at $30 but he also stocks a basic line where trunks are $30 and briefs $17. ""The core audience [for the CR7 range] is football fans who aspire to Ronaldo's look and image,"" Martin adds. ""The age range is mainly 18-24 year olds and slightly older. ""The beauty of Ronaldo is that he cuts across quite a big demographic."" The aesthetic allure of Ronaldo, Rodriguez and Beckham is an undeniable factor in why their underwear packs a punch. Beckham stopped traffic as an underwear model for Emporio Armani before collaborating with H&M while the perfectly manicured Ronaldo oozes style on and off the pitch. Rodriguez may still be baby faced but he is already winning awards for his looks, voted the world's sexiest man in 2014 by Spain's ""People"" magazine. When this handsome trio launched their underwear collections, they not only appealed to football fans but to their gift buying wives, girlfriends and mothers too. ""I'm sure H&M chose David Beckham because he's a very attractive, fit fellow,"" Seth Stevenson, New York based senior writer for Slate, told CNN. ""They also chose him because he has appeal in a lot of different places. He's famous in Asia, he's well known in the U.S. and he's married to Victoria Beckham. ""He's got some profile all over the world and they've got stores all over the world. ""Celebrities are a popular advertising gambit because people are interested in celebrities and like to do what they do."" The pioneer of the celebrity underwear market was, however, not a footballer but Swedish tennis ace Bjorn Borg. After his sudden retirement from the game in 1983 at the age of just 26, the 11-time grand slam singles champion served up another winner by launching his eponymous underwear brand in 1984. The company now sells around five million items of underwear across its male and female ranges each year and is stocked in 20 global markets. ""The Bjorn Borg name is a very strong part of this success,"" says the company's marketing and communications manager Jonas Lindberg Nyvang. ""He's still involved in that he comes to the office, he's informed about what we do and he's still part of the process."" Borg's dashing good looks, like those of Beckham, Ronaldo and Rodriguez, certainly helped him cut a dash in the underwear market but sustaining a successful brand over 30 years relies on more than superficial appeal. Sports stars arguably make natural underwear manufacturers because they understand more than most about the importance of comfort on the go. ""If you have the right underwear you feel more confidence on the court or off the court,"" explains Nyvang. ""It's important for sporting performance. ""At Bjorn Borg we focus on the perfect fit and we are also very fashion conscious. We put out underwear that makes people feel more active and attractive."" But before you dream about wrapping up a Nigel de Jong thong or a pair of Neymar knickers for your loved ones, bear in mind it takes a certain type of star to make money from undies. ""You are talking about one-offs here,"" says Martin. ""There are probably only a handful of global sports stars that can attempt something like this. ""For every Ronaldo there are thousands and thousands and thousands of footballers who don't make a thousandth of what he does."" Stevenson agrees that true sporting icons stand a better chance of successfully creating a product line that is not directly connected to their core business -- but that even then there could be pit falls.","Football stars are cashing in on Christmas market for branded underwear .

"(CNN) -- Marussia driver Jules Bianchi underwent emergency surgery for a ""severe head injury"" after crashing in the closing stages of Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix. Lewis Hamilton won the typhoon-hit race to extend his title lead over second-placed Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg, but his victory was totally overshadowed by the accident to 25-year-old Frenchman Bianchi. With nine laps of the scheduled 53 remaining, the race was under a red flag after Adrian Sutil of Sauber crashed at turn eight of the Suzuka circuit. As Sutil's car was being recovered, Bianchi's Marussia careered off at the same place, plowing into the truck which was being used to remove Sutil's car. Medical staff rushed to Bianchi's aid and he was taken to the nearby Mie Prefectural General Medical Center by ambulance. Motorsport's governing body, the FIA, later released a statement with an update on his condition. ""The CT scan shows that he has suffered a severe head injury and is currently undergoing surgery,"" read the statement. ""Following this he will be moved to intensive care where he will be monitored."" Makoto Sakaeda, the official in charge of communication at the hospital, told CNN that the operation was complete and that Bianchi remained at the facility. Hamilton's third straight victory stretched his advantage over Rosberg in the championship standings to 10 points with four rounds remaining . Departing Sebastian Vettel got the better of Red Bull teammate Daniel Ricciardo in their own private battle for the final place on the podium. But at the presentations all the drivers' thoughts were with Bianchi and the traditional champagne-spraying celebration did not take place. Typhoon Phanfone, which is sweeping across Japan, had led to fears the race might have to be abandoned and it started in heavy rain and behind the safety car. After just two laps it was suspended after drivers complained of the severely restricted visibility. When it restarted, it developed into a duel between pole sitter Rosberg and Hamilton. On lap 29, a bold overtaking move by Hamilton saw him take a lead he never relinquished. As the race neared its finish and in fading light conditions worsened, with Germany's Sutil aquaplaning across the track before going into the barriers. Sutil was out of his car when he witnessed Bianchi's crash. ""I had a spin and ended up in the wall,"" he said. ""I stood up and they tried to rescue the car. Jules was in the same area and lost the car. I have no more information. We are all aware of the situation. Hopefully he is in good hands,"" AFP reported. Rosberg summed up the mood of the paddock as he spoke at the podium presentation. ""I'm not thinking about the race -- I'm thinking about my colleague. I'm hoping for the best,"" said the German. The 25-year Bianchi, from Nice, is rated one of the most promising young drivers on the circuit, giving minnows Marussia its first points with a brilliant ninth place in the Monaco Grand Prix earlier this year. CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki and Euan McKirdy contributed to this report.","Lewis Hamilton wins weather-hit Japanese Grand Prix .

"On Wednesday, al Qaeda's virulent Yemeni affiliate which is known as al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) confirmed the death of the group's deputy leader and co-founder, Saeed al-Shihri, in a video message posted to jihadist websites. It was a confirmation of what was long suspected: that Shihri was killed in a U.S. drone strike several months ago. And it also amounted to a concession that the al Qaeda  affiliate is under an enormous amount of pressure. In the past three years more than 30 al Qaeda leaders and other senior operatives in Yemen have been killed by U.S. drone strikes, according to a count by the New America Foundation. The militants killed by those drone strikes included Anwar al-Awlaki, the fiery Yemeni-American preacher who served as a key ideologue for the group and has been an inspiration for a wide range of militants living in the West, including the Tsarnaev brothers who are accused of bombing the Boston Marathon in April. Not all of the drone strikes in Yemen have found their targets. New America Foundation's review of reliable media reporting of those strikes found that somewhere between 38 and 71 of the casualties were civilians, which included Awlaki's 16-year-old son. A Yemeni tribal leader close to AQAP says the drone strikes have sown mistrust within the group, where there is ""a feeling that the Americans have infiltrated its ranks, especially with the killing of several of its leaders."" Al-Shihri, a Saudi who spent six years at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, was first reported killed in January. The Yemeni government quickly confirmed Shihri's death, but until now AQAP had denied it. AQAP's video message confirming Shihri's death was delivered by Ibrahim al-Rubaish, another Saudi who was also formerly held at Guantanamo Bay. In the 11Â½-minute video, which we have reviewed, Rubaish gushes about Shihri's devotion to al Qaeda's cause. Rubaish says Shihri was ""searching for martyrdom,"" trumpeting his combat against U.S. forces in Afghanistan where he suffered serious injuries to his hands and legs, and lost an eye. Shihri was released from Guantanamo in November 2007, and entered a Saudi rehabilitation program and was then released.  Rubaish says Shihri subsequently planned an attack on the U.S. Embassy in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, which killed 10 Yemeni policemen and civilians. But Shihri grew complacent. ""Lax security measures during his telephone calls enabled the enemy to identify and kill him,"" Rubaish declared in his eulogy. Shihri's death in the U.S. drone strike is part of larger story of AQAP decline over the past two years. In 2011, AQAP had gained significant territory in Yemen as it exploited the popular uprising against longtime Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh. Its core membership grew from approximately 300 members in 2009 to around 1,000 three years later, according to Gregory Johnsen, the author of the authoritative book ""The Last Refuge: Yemen, al-Qaeda, and America's War in Arabia"". But the jihadist group lost all of these gains within about a year. An offensive by the Yemeni army that was supported by U.S. intelligence last year pushed AQAP out of the central Yemeni province of Abyan, forcing AQAP's fighters to flee to the remote desert province of Hadramaut. The group has since been reduced to carrying out much smaller attacks; nothing compared to the massive suicide bombing it was able to conduct in the heart of the Yemeni capital in May 2012, which killed upwards of 100 soldiers as they rehearsed for a military parade. And despite its focus on attacking U.S. targets, AQAP has not tried to attack one since its October 2010 attempt to plant bombs hidden in printer cartridges on cargo planes destined for the United States. (Last year AQAP plotted to send an operative with explosives in his underwear aboard a plane bound for the United States, but that operative was actually secretly working for the British and Saudi intelligence services, so the plot was never a real threat.) Despite all the losses AQAP has suffered its capable chief bomb maker, Ibrahim al-Asiri, remains at large. Al-Asiri was the brains behind AQAP's failed ""underwear bomb"" attempt to bring down a Detroit-bound U.S. airliner on Christmas Day 2009. AQAP's overall leader, Nasser al-Wuhayshi also remains at large, Wuhayshi is AQAP's founder and his continued survival is surely important for the organization. AQAP could regenerate, particularly if Yemen sees more upheaval, but for now, the group is on the run from the Yemeni army and U.S. drone strikes, fearful of spies in its midst, is unable to launch large-scale attacks, and boasts a dwindling cadre of leaders. AQAP, in short, is struggling to survive.","Al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen confirms death of a key leader .

"House Speaker John Boehner may have stood up to conservative arm-twisters and embraced bipartisanship in moving a budget agreement through the House, but insiders don't see it as the start of a sea change on Capitol Hill. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is one who was pragmatic about Boehner's new and  strident public tone this week toward several influential conservative groups that have questioned his leadership and blasted the compromise budget plan approved Thursday. Senior GOP aides also cautioned that Boehner's rhetorical flogging of these groups was not part of a larger legislative strategy moving forward -- especially on immigration reform. They view it as the Speaker simply calling out people who he thought crossed a line. Boehner took to the podium on Wednesday and Thursday to say that he was fed up with criticism from conservative advocates. At first, he said they were ""misleading their followers."" He followed up with this round-house: . ""Frankly, I just think that they've lost all credibility."" Spat puts conservative groups in the spotlight . In recent months, Boehner has downplayed internal GOP splits and was on the defensive about why he bent to pressure from the conservative wing of the party to wage what amounted to unwinnable fights with Democrats. Some vindication . The inability of Boehner to control his majority in the House, many of whom take their cues from conservative advocates, has fostered perpetual gridlock on Capitol Hill and dwindling public support for Republicans and the overall Congress. Thursday's budget vote may provided some vindication for Boehner as the House overwhelmingly approved a bipartisan compromise panned by conservative advocates, sending it to the Senate, where it is expected to pass next week. He enthusiastically banged the gavel down and thundered the final tally -- 332-94. Boehner said the proposal hammered out by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan and his Senate counterpart, Patty Murray, didn't achieve everything Republicans wanted. But it proposes to reduce the deficit, relax forced military and other spending cuts under so-called sequestration, avoid another government shutdown, and restore a semblance of order to the congressional budget process, which has become an area of recurring political crisis in Washington. House approves budget deal aimed at averting shutdown . A push on immigration coming? Pelosi said she was ""encouraged"" by Boehner's pushback.  But when pressed if she thought Republicans would turn over a new leaf and begin working across party lines on other issues, she didn't sound convinced that much would change. ""Certainly not achieving this would not have been a good signal, but I don't under or overestimate the power of this one event today,"" Pelosi said. Immigration is one issue that has been stalled in the House over Republican divisions. Those pushing for comprehensive reform seized on Boehner's posture to conservative advocates. ""Our lawmakers' abilities to work across the aisle will continue to be crucial for us to overhaul our broken immigration system,""  Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, said. ""The budget vote displayed Speaker Boehner's great willingness to work across the aisle and move forward on issues that have bipartisan support,"" he said. But senior congressional GOP aides caution that Boehner's comments this week did not signal a broader approach on legislation. California Republican Rep Darrell Issa told reporters he's been working to bridge the partisan divide over immigration for the past 13 years, but he predicted any progress will remain elusive. ""I would love it if we could find acceptable middle ground in which nobody won but the American people on immigration reform.  I don't expect it.  I'm working for it but I don't expect it after this many years,"" he said. Texas GOP Rep Pete Sessions flat out rejected the notion this budget deal means a green light for major immigration legislation. ""I don't see that this is now clear channel for us to then move immigration, no I don't.  I don't think that's what this was about,"" he said. Not seeing eye-to-eye . A test of whether Boehner will continue to confront conservative criticism looms on another fiscal fight next year - the debate over increasing the nation's ability to borrow money to pay its bills -- or the debt limit. That issue has rallied fiscal hard liners and outside groups to demand new spending reductions and entitlement reforms, Boehner will certainly face another round of pressure to not compromise with Democrats. 5 reasons why Congress might (finally) pass a budget . Why the move now to take on these groups?  Boehner didn't see eye-to- eye with many of them for some time, but hasn't been willing to go public with his disagreements. Those close to the Speaker say his public comments weren't any different than what he's been saying in closed-door meetings with Republican members. One senior House GOP leadership aide told CNN that once the attacks got personal, Boehner felt the need to fight back. The fact that conservative groups started attacking the budget deal before it was even announced particularly bothered Boehner, the aide said. Asserting authority . Military retirees: You betrayed us, Congress . At one point, Boehner acknowledged the power of these groups have had over House Republicans, saying ""they pushed us into the fight to defund Obamacare and shut down the government"" in October. After Boehner's comments on Thursday, the same groups he singled out showed no signs of backing down. ""I don't think it's for anyone in Washington to decide who has credibility,"" Michael Needham of Heritage Action said in an interview with CNN. ""The American people have the right to be told different perspectives on a deal. We're trying to have a policy disagreement with the deal that was cut, and that's healthy."" Rubio, Paul, Cruz critical of budget deal .","John Boehner blasted conservative groups this week over the budget .
He pushed through spending compromise that averts shutdown with big support .

"It's a political axiom that the closer Congress gets to an election, the less work it gets done. But here's the current math: what's less than nothing? And if you do even less than nothing, at what point does it become completely counterproductive and silly? We've reached it. Have you noticed lately that real ideas are out of vogue? A serious GOP committee chairman makes a big â€” and, yes, controversial -- proposal to reform the tax code.  Here's how his ultimate leader, House Speaker John Boehner, reacts when asked about parts of the plan: ""Blah, blah, blah blah."" No kidding. The President, who once endorsed an idea to change the way Social Security benefits are calculated as a way to curb its growth, has now said ""Never mind."" It won't be in his budget, for fear that his liberal base would desert him over it. Republicans, who started the year saying that immigration reform should be on the agenda, are now saying, as the speaker put it, the President can't be ""trusted"" to implement any serious measure.  And Democrats say the President can't be trusted to do a trade agreement without angering the important constituency of organized labor, so bye-bye ""fast track"" trade bill. Bill to help veterans fails . Truth is, it isn't about trust at all. It's about winning in 2014. And an important part of winning, it seems, is to paper over all dissent within your own party in order to present a united front to the voters. So the election will be this: Us or them? Obamacare or no Obamacare? Do you like me better? Do you like government? Do you like poor people or rich people? That's our debate -- the sum total of our big ideas right now. Not wanting to start any fights within your own party. Unity above all heading into the midterm elections. So maybe Congress should just close up shop and leave town because nothing is going to happen for the next nine months. Just turn off the lights. Both parties are making the same political calculation for the same reason: They can't afford to have any internal debate lest they seem less than united against the enemy. Turns out that the permanent campaign is still alive and well. Here's the glitch in this narrative: Voters, it turns out, actually want some solutions to problems. They want to see the deficit go down; they want to find a way to fix immigration. A majority (63%) is worried the country is on the wrong track. And, according to a new CBS/New York Times poll, eight in 10 Americans are fed up with Washington. Somehow, voters haven't gotten the message that Congress -- in its steadfast intent to accomplish nothing -- is just trying to appeal to them. But remember what happened to Mitt Romney's campaign. Romney lost for lots of reasons, but one of them was sticking too long to the assumption that if people were unhappy with the direction of the country and the other guy, that would be enough to win. It wasn't. The candidate mattered. And ideas mattered, too. The ""big"" GOP idea this time is to bash Obamacare, relentlessly, endlessly, in a continual loop. Sure, it's unpopular, but what about if it starts working for people? What if people are sick of hearing about it now that the website is working? And what if people are more inclined to mend it than end it? If Obamacare is the only trick in the bag, it might not be enough. Then there's the Democrats' income inequality refrain. It's not new, it can work, and sure, it unites the Democrats. But by taking almost everything of substance off the table, it's the President's legacy and record of achievement that gets compromised, along with the voters. The truth is this: It's a tight political fight. Polls right now show that the public, by a small 42%-39% margin, would back Republicans for office in the 2014 midterm elections. They're not thrilled with the President's job performance. They have soured on the President personally, and they can barely stomach the Congress. So what's the political solution? No substance, no ideas, no serious debate that might actually engage voters. Each side suits up, armed with its slogans and its bromides. And we inevitably re-elect the Congress we hate.","Gloria Borger: It's a given that Congress does little approaching an election .

"All presidential decisions are, in the end, difficult and complex. And under any circumstance, the decisions on issues of war (surgical strikes included) are agonizing. The decision to use force -- the repercussions, the cost in blood and treasure, the geostrategic implications -- is complicated and the implications obviously immense. But as the Syria story unfolds, there is an almost Shakespearean drama beneath the surface -- one of political careers made and broken, of past positions held and almost abandoned. Not to mention the political enemies now finding themselves -- awkwardly -- on the same side of history. As the public debate plays out, the political past lingers, and haunts every moment. First consider the irony of Barack Obama himself. It's no surprise to anyone that this president is a reluctant warrior. His rise to national prominence was based, in part, on his antiwar sentiment on Iraq. In the past, he's been a forceful proponent of the need for congressional authorization for the use of force. He tells the American people, at every opportunity, that he is extracting us from two wars. That was at the top of his to-do list, and he's doing it. So now this, er, wrinkle in which Obama becomes the conscientious aggressor. He is the president who defends his National Security Agency surveillance strategy and his frequent use of drones to an unhappy Democratic base. He drew the red line on chemical weapons (which he now explains was also the world's red line). He's certain we need to hit Bashar al-Assad but seeks support from a Congress he generally disdains. Like Lewis Carroll's Alice in ""Through the Looking Glass,"" Obama could well be asking, ""I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then."" Indeed. As the president himself pointed out Wednesday in Sweden, ""had I been in the Senate, I would have suggested Congress have the ability to weigh in."" It was hardly lost on him that it would seem, well, a tad hypocritical that someone who had spoken repeatedly about a congressional buy-in on the use of force was now willing to go it alone. So after the British said no, the president looked homeward for a coalition of the willing. And so, another irony: The president's legacy now is in the hands of a notoriously paralyzed and partisan Congress -- a Congress that hasn't exactly friended him. And that brings us to the agony part of this drama -- Sen. John McCain. Here's the man who lost to Obama in 2008 and remains his foreign policy nemesis. McCain is the GOP's major (and increasingly lonely) hawk-in-residence. He thinks Obama made a huge mistake in not arming the Syrian rebels and charges the president with dawdling for two years while this civil war intensified. Oh, and by the way, he believes Obama's surgical strike is too little, too late. And yet, here he is, on the verge of supporting Obama—and taking on the libertarians in his own party. And not because he likes him, and not because he likes the policy—but because he believes that a congressional no-vote could be ""catastrophic"" for the nation. In the end, he may still balk because the mission, as defined by Congress, is too narrow. But he clearly wants to find a way to stand with the president. ""Alice in Wonderland"" would be right at home. ""I can't go back to yesterday,"" she understood. ""Because I was a different person then.""","Gloria Borger: Decisions about military strikes are always agonizing and difficult .

"(CNN) -- It's the elephant in the room of Formula One. Will Michael Schumacher ever recover from the serious head injury he suffered in a skiing accident six months ago? The sport has continued its relentless rhythm unsure of what the future holds for its record-breaking former world champion, with the most recent update on his condition on the eve of June's Austrian Grand Prix travelling round the F1 community like Chinese whispers. ""Michael has left the [hospital in] Grenoble to continue his long phase of rehabilitation,"" read the June 16 statement from Schumacher's long-time manager and the family's spokeswoman Sabine Kehm. ""He is not in a coma anymore,"" added the statement, which was oblique enough to be left open to interpretation. As the months have stretched on since the accident, so has the reluctance to openly discuss the state of Schumacher's health within the sport's inner circle. Felipe Massa, who drove alongside Schumacher at Ferrari, has been to visit his former teammate in hospital on more than one occasion. He found the news, as limited as it was, encouraging: ""It's definitely positive that he's moved from the hospital and that he's going to another place that is specific for the recovery,"" the Williams driver told CNN ahead of this weekend's British Grand Prix . ""I keep hoping that everything will be better and better all the time. The only thing I want is that the recovery takes as quick as possible and to see him here with us."" Red Bull's four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel has been cautious about making public statements on the health of his former mentor. In Austria, the German broke his silence to reflect on the conflicting feelings of continuing his day job in F1 while the sport's seven-time world champion faces an even bigger challenge than the high-risk world of motor racing. ""It's been a long time and you try to follow as much as you can,"" Vettel told the media with an audible sigh as he searched to find the right words. ""It's very positive to hear but, like I said, it's been many, many weeks and months since the incident and obviously you find yourself busy in Formula One thinking about a lot of things. ""Sometimes it's crazy to imagine or realize that Michael is still in hospital and still fighting, . ""Therefore it's good to finally have some good news and I hope that there will be more good news coming -- but I think it will still take a long time for his recovery."" In a sport of strategy, where risk and outcome are calculated in hundredths of seconds, the uncertainty and lack of knowledge about Schumacher, a global star, has hung like a pall over the sport. Interest in Schumacher's state of health is so intense that stolen medical files that may belong to the German have been offered for sale. ""Even people in the paddock who should be quite close have the feeling that we don't know what's going on,"" Schumacher's biographer and respected F1 journalist Karin Sturm told CNN. ""The policy of the family is to keep everything very, very private. Perhaps Corinna [Schumacher's wife] maybe doesn't realize is that by this policy speculation is growing. ""There is a lot of public interest, they are concerned. A bit more information about what his current state of health is would be welcomed."" The difficulty with complex head injuries is that there is no predictable prognosis or timeline for recovery. In the immediate aftermath of the accident at the French Alps resort of Meribel, neurosurgeons operated on Schumacher twice to remove blood clots and reduce swelling on his brain before placing him in a medically induced coma. In April, a statement from the family said the 45-year-old had shown ""moments of consciousness and awakening."" Last month, it was announced he was out of the coma and would continue his recovery at the University hospital in Lausanne close to the family home in Switzerland. ""What tortures the public is the same thing that tortures the family --progress is slow, progress is uncertain,"" said Peter Hamlyn, a consultant neurological and spinal surgeon and expert in the field of head injuries in sport. ""If you look at severe head injury victims who go on to make a good recovery -- and I'm not saying all do -- it will always be a story of years. ""The first months are dominated by questions of survival. Gradually as the weeks and months go by those questions of survival turn into questions of the quality of survival. ""It's a rollercoaster and if Michael Schumacher's rollercoaster takes him and his family somewhere happy then they will have been to places that will have been pretty unhappy on the way there. ""But I know they will have been buoyed by all the support that has been voiced."" Hamlyn speaks from a very public, personal experience following his successful high-profile treatment of brain-damaged boxer Michael Watson. The British boxer collapsed in the ring after being knocked down by fellow Briton Chris Eubank in a world title fight in 1991. Hamlyn, who operated to remove a blood clot on Watson's brain shortly after his collapse and then guided his slow and painful recovery, is credited with saving Watson's life. Although the news on Schumacher's condition is scant, Hamlyn says the wording of the June statement is reason to be positive. ""If I was using that language I would be suggesting that there had been some improvement and if you see improvement you may see more,"" he explained. ""I would take that as a hopeful sign. ""My reading of what I've seen in the press is that Michael has made it through the current cut and he's still in the game."" Watson could not speak or hear for eight months after his accident. After six years in a wheelchair, he completed the 2003 London Marathon in an agonizing but rewarding six days. Now, more than 20 years on from his brutal boxing bout, Watson's mind is sharp, his speech slurred but understandable and he can walk unaided, albeit with some difficulty. Hamlyn believes the boxer's training as a world-class sportsman aided his long physical and mental recovery -- and the same principles can also be applied to Schumacher. ""The thing about supreme athletes like Michael Watson and Michael Schumacher is that they have extraordinary physical reserves,"" Hamlyn said. ""Injuries that would carry away most people are things they can get past."" Watson underwent numerous operations at Hamlyn's hand but the surgeon credits the boxer's tenacity and indomitable spirit with his recovery as much as medical intervention. ""It played a huge part,"" Hamlyn reflected. ""He's an absolutely humbling man when you get to know him. Things that would crush most of us, he does with extraordinary cheerfulness. ""I think that does come from the sort of tenacity, reserve and determination that you have to have if you're to get to the top of any world sport. ""Athletes also have this ingrained attitude towards training that you have to repeat a thing a thousand times and then another thousand times until you get the thing right. ""Providing the right environment for recovery is actually very difficult and specialized. You have to continually stimulate and draw people on. ""You have to keep changing the challenge, just moving it a little bit further forward so they relearn and regain their abilities as best they can. ""When you talk to individuals who've survived, they never gave up. The families never gave up. That's a tough thing to do year on year."" Nico Rosberg has recently commented to the German media that he witnessed Schumacher's famous mental resolve throughout three years as his Mercedes teammate and hopes this will guide the former champion through the next stage of his rehabilitation. ""Nico said he knows what a fighter Michael can be,"" explained Sturm, who reports on F1 for Tagesspiegel and Spiegel Online in Germany. ""He knew that Michael never let anything slip, even at the end of his career when he knew he was going to retire he was still fighting and pushing. ""If there is somebody who can really fight back and get into life, it is probably Michael."" For the watching world, it is difficult to know how far Schumacher has come on his journey since the accident and how far there is to go. There may just be a moment of inspiration, of interaction, which provides hope when it is least expected -- because that is what happened as Hamlyn watched what he describes as Watson's ""miraculous"" recovery. ""One day, some months into this business, Muhammad Ali came to see him at the hospital,"" recalled Hamlyn. ""Ali, who was pretty ill already by then with Parkinson's disease, went up to the end of Michael's bed, said words to the effect of 'Hello champ' and held out his fist. ""Michael's eyes not only opened but focused on him, and this enormous smile appeared across his face as he realized who it was who had come to see him -- and it was at that point that I knew that things went in, got processed and could come out. ""It was at that point that you know that people have the capacity to relearn, and to recover. ""Now, in the world of motor racing I've no idea who Muhammad Ali is -- unless it's Michael Schumacher."" The world waits to see whether Schumacher, the ruthless racer, the sport's record-breaking world champion, can once again be his own inspiration.","Michael Schumacher's treatment for a serious head injury is into its seventh month .

"(CNN) -- There is a simple message for Michael Schumacher one year on from his devastating accident -- keep fighting. Formula One's record-breaking, seven-time world champion is continuing his recovery from the severe head injuries he sustained in a skiing crash on 29th December last year. After emergency brain surgery in France and nine months in hospital, Schumacher has been moved to the family home near Lake Geneva in Switzerland to continue his rehabilitation. His close family, including his wife Corinna and two teenage children Gina Marie and Mick, have maintained their silent support by choosing not to release a statement on the anniversary of the accident. Schumacher's son Mick, who is beginning his own racing career in go-karts, had been among the skiing party when the F1 star fell and hit his head on a rock at the French Alps resort of Meribel. There were expressions of support for Schumacher, however, from the German racer's global fans and members of the F1 community, Monday. ""It has been one year already..."" wrote Lotus driver Romain Grosjean on Twitter. ""#KeepFightingMichael our thoughts are still with you and your family."" Red Bull driver Daniil Kvyat also marked the occasion: ""#KeepFightingMichael -- I know you will."" The Mercedes team, who Schumacher drove for between 2010 and 2012, said: ""One year on, our thoughts remain with Michael, his family and friends every day."" Although 12 months have passed since the accident, speculation about Schumacher's condition and its rate of progress remains as intense as ever. Former F1 racer Philippe Streiff, who was left paralysed during an F1 testing crash in 1989, added grist to the rumor mill in an interview with French newspaper Le Parisien, Sunday. The Frenchman claimed Schumacher ""still has not regained the power of speech....but begins to recognize his own wife and children."" Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm dismissed the story, telling the Reuters news agency: ""I can only confirm that I do not know where Mr Streiff has his information from because he has no contact with us and never has."" Given Schumacher's fame, it is no surprise that public interest in his state of health is unabated. The German, winner of a record 91 grand prix, was known as fearless racer who gave no quarter on track. Fans of ""Schumi"" expect him to continue his fight against his injuries with the same inner steel and determination. The difficulty with complex head injuries is that there is no predictable prognosis or timeline for recovery. ""If you look at severe head injury victims who go on to make a good recovery -- and I'm not saying all do -- it will always be a story of years,"" Peter Hamlyn, a consultant neurological and spinal surgeon and expert in the field of head injuries in sport told CNN in June. In the immediate aftermath of the accident, neurosurgeons operated on Schumacher twice to remove blood clots and reduce swelling on his brain before placing him in a medically induced coma. A statement from the family in April said the 45-year-old had shown ""moments of consciousness and awakening."" In June, it was announced he was out of the coma and would continue his recovery at the University hospital in Lausanne. He was moved to the family home in September. The latest statement, issued in September, read: ""Considering the severe injuries he suffered, progress has been made in the past weeks and months. There is still, however, a long and difficult road ahead. ""We ask that the privacy of Michael's family continue to be respected, and that speculations about his state of health are avoided."" Kehn confirmed to CNN that there was no further update on his medical condition at this time. Schumacher, who won the F1 drivers' world title with Benetton in 1994 and 1995 before a period of dominance with Ferrari between 2000 and 2004, will turn 46 on 3rd January. While Schumacher had retired from the sport in 2012, after a second spell with Mercedes, his accident on the ski slopes still sent shockwaves through F1. But the global sport's close-knit traveling community had to cushion more devastating news in October when Jules Bianchi crashed in the late stages of the Japanese Grand Prix. The French racer, driving for the now defunct Marussia team, was left with severe head injuries when his car skidded off track in wet conditions and collided with a recovery vehicle. It was the most serious injury seen in F1 for some years. The last fatalities in F1 were in 1994 when Roland Ratzenberger and three-time world champion Ayrton Senna died on consecutive days at the San Marino Grand Prix. Bianchi, a promising racer who was part of Ferrari's development academy, is now recovering close to his family home in Nice, France. The 25-year-old was flown from Japan, where he had been treated in a high dependency unit at Yokkaichi hospital. ""Jules is no longer in the artificial coma in which he was placed shortly after the accident, however he is still unconscious,"" said the statement released by his parents Philippe and Christine in November. ""He is breathing unaided and his vital signs are stable, but his condition is still classified as 'critical'."" Bianchi, a popular figure on the current F1 grid, is also being remembered during the festive period. His racing peers Sergio Perez and Kevin Magnussen both tweeted messages of support to Bianchi on Christmas Day. American racer Alexander Rossi wrote: ""As we come to the end of the year, my thoughts and prayers remain with Jules -- teammate, competitor and friend."" As the New Year dawns, Schumacher and Bianchi are both still facing the greatest fights of their lives.","It is one year since Michael Schumacher suffered head injuries in a skiing crash .

"Some days start out historic. The gay civil rights movement has reached the Supreme Court -- a milestone by any measure.  We won't know what the justices will decide until June, but it is not too early to reflect on how we got here. The sea change in public opinion on gay rights in general and same-sex marriage in particular has been unprecedented.  A decade ago, just 27% of Americans backed same-sex marriage; today it is a clear majority. In recent weeks, politicians like Hillary Clinton and Republicans Jon Huntsman and Rob Portman have declared their support for marriage equality.  And while far more elected Democrats than Republicans support same-sex marriage, polls show that this is increasingly more of a generational divide than a partisan divide.  In fact, a majority of Republicans under age 50 now support the freedom to marry -- including more than 60% of evangelicals under 30. How did this happen? First, give the activists their due. Thought leaders like Evan Wolfson and Andrew Sullivan deserve a lot of credit for taking early stands in favor of the freedom to marry.  Former San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom also brought recognition to the issue by officiating over same-sex marriage ceremonies at City Hall. CNN Poll: ""Rob Portman effect"" fuels support for same-sex marriage . The movement to encourage gays and lesbians to publicly come out has also broken down barriers, forcing friends and family members to confront reality, leading to greater compassion and recognition of the moral imperative of civil rights, rooted in the golden rule: Treat others as you would like to be treated. But the mainstreaming of marriage equality reflects a strategic shift as well as a cultural shift. Instead of activists bringing attention to the cause with street theater tactics that often alienate more people than they attract, there has been a relatively recent move to build bridges beyond the base.  This means outreach to Republicans as well as making counter-intuitively conservative arguments for same-sex marriage. Embodying this strategic shift is Ted Olson, the former Bush administration solicitor general who teamed up with David Boies, his opponent in the Bush v Gore Supreme Court case, to argue that California's Proposition 8 banning same-sex marriage was unconstitutional.  I interviewed them in 2010 and their comments reflected many of the arguments Olson made at the Supreme Court on Tuesday. ""We as conservatives should support the right of decent taxpaying citizens and individuals who want a stable relationship that forms a building block of our neighborhoods and our economy and our society,"" Olson said.  ""These are people that want to participate in life as citizens the way the rest of us do. We should be supportive as conservatives and as liberals. It's not exclusive to either party or either part of the political spectrum."" ""This is not and should not be viewed as a conservative or liberal or Republican or Democratic issue,"" Boies added. ""This is a civil-rights issue and a human-rights issue."" Opinion: Will gay rights infringe on religious liberty? This is an essentially centrist strategy: Define the common ground that exists on any given issue and then build on it, proceeding from broad principle rather than partisan politics and positional bargaining. Olson and Boies, a Republican and a Democrat, are proud members of their parties.  But their powerful partnership represents an understanding of the vital center as a dynamic way of solving problems, creating new coalitions that can help overturn decades of stubborn stereotypes about the split-the-difference impulse of the ""mushy middle."" Look at the ads that have been run in favor of marriage equality, especially this effort by the Respect for Marriage coalition (which, full disclosure, my wife and fellow CNN contributor, Margaret Hoover, participated in) that included public testimonies in favor of marriage equality by Colin Powell, Dick Cheney and President Obama, highlighting unexpected common ground. Notice the images of apple pie Americana that begin the ad, making the visual case that marriage is an essentially conservative institution that leads to societal stability and reduced dependence on the government. Likewise, look at the 131 Republicans who signed on to the amicus brief in support of the freedom to marry, including prominent members of the Bush administration and the Romney campaign, both of which had pledged to pursue a federal marriage amendment. It is a heartening sign of centrists and libertarians breaking the social conservative stranglehold on the GOP. It is a reminder that the essence of evangelism is winning converts. Language also matters.  To some ears, ""Gay marriage"" is more polarizing than ""freedom to marry"" (the preferred term for conservatives) and ""marriage equality"" (a phraseology that unites liberals). The emphasis on individual freedom and civil rights helps humanize the issue. Opinion: The real 'modern family' in America . All this is a form of triangulation: trying to achieve progress on policy by depolarizing an issue, creating new coalitions.  It is effective.  And it is built on a sturdy foundation because it reminds us of deeper truths, namely that there is more that unites us than divides us as Americans. Perhaps not coincidentally, it also is the type of argument that might sway swing votes on the Supreme Court -- as well as swing voters -- to support this extension of individual civil rights. The shift in public opinion overturns centuries of established thought about marriage influenced by culture and religion.  The fact that it has been comparatively rapid is a reflection of the durability and flexibility of our democracy. We can adapt as part of our never-ending effort to form a more perfect union. Whatever the Supreme Court ultimately decides about the constitutionality of Proposition 8 and the Defense of Marriage Act, the movement of same-sex marriage from the margins to the mainstream has been achieved. Opinion: California wants a do-over on same-sex marriage vote . The centrist model by which it moved forward can be replicated as we try to call a ceasefire in the culture wars and actually start to solve problems through the process of addition rather than division.","John Avlon says the success of the gay rights movement is historic .
Avlon: Whatever court decides, same-sex marriage has been endorsed by majority in U.S.
Supporters of gay rights skillfully positioned the movement as bipartisan and centrist, he says .
Avlon: Progress on gay rights is a model for reaching consensus on other issues ."
"(CNN) -- How do you go back to work when one of your colleagues has been seriously injured? That is the reality facing the field of Formula One drivers just days after French racer Jules Bianchi suffered a potentially devastating type of brain injury at the Japanese Grand Prix. ""It's principally business as usual,"" John Watson, who raced in the sport's attritional era of the 1970s and 80s, told CNN. ""But it will affect some more than others. ""Today's generation of drivers have never seen what they had to deal with on Sunday. It will make them realize that they are no longer infallible."" Bianchi underwent surgery Sunday at Mie General Hospital and remains in a critical but stable condition, his family said in a statement Tuesday. The 25-year-old's Marussia car collided with a recovery vehicle as heavy rain sent slick rivers down the demanding Suzuka circuit. The race was red-flagged soon afterwards, a few laps short of the race distance, with Lewis Hamilton declared winner. As the drivers climbed out of the cars, they were met by grim-faced team members explaining that one of their number was injured. There were muted celebrations on the podium for Hamilton, his Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg and Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel; the champagne stayed on ice. Ferrari's Fernando Alonso gave an insight into the brooding preoccupation the accident brought him, writing on Twitter Sunday night: ""Difficult to sleep... #ForzaJules."" This experienced band and their peers will climb back into the cockpits and resume racing at this week's inaugural Russian Grand Prix while Bianchi continues his personal fight in Japan. David Brabham can empathize. He faced the queasy dilemma of driving in the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix after his teammate Roland Ratzenberger had been killed in qualifying the day before. The Australian, son of three-time world champion Jack Brabham, decided he would compete in the fateful Imola race that would also take the life of Brazilian hero Ayrton Senna. ""When an accident like that happens it hits you like a bolt of lightning,"" Brabham told CNN. ""I made a decision to race because I said 'we have to keep the show on the road.' I knew Roland well enough to know he would have said 'if it's safe get out there.' ""We raced for him as well, and it was the only way I could pick the team up to continue what we had to do."" Dancing with danger is part of the job description for each and every racing driver. Last week's race at Suzuka was, however, made more complex by rain swirling around the incoming Typhoon Phanfone. When the race began at 3pm local time, the field completed two opening laps behind the safety car before being called back to the pit lane to wait until track conditions improved. The race restarted after a 20-minute delay and Bianchi's accident came as more heavy rain coincided with fading day light as the race reached its climax. The events stirred echoes of the 1976 Japanese Grand Prix when Niki Lauda effectively handed the world title to rival James Hunt by choosing not to race as a deluge swamped the Fuji circuit. Lauda, now a guiding voice for the Mercedes drivers as the team's non-executive chairman, argued his life was worth more than the world title. In contrast, Watson, racing for the Penske-Ford team, was one of the drivers who decided to drive despite the dangers. ""I raced. I had no problem,"" Watson recalls. ""The conditions were diabolical all through Sunday. ""At Fuji, when we started the race, the track conditions were very bad probably every bit as bad, if not worse, than Suzuka. ""Japan has a different attitude to the role of a sportsman, you're a samurai in a way to the Japanese public. ""There was a championship to be decided, F1 was just beginning to make a global footprint in terms of television. There was huge pressure. ""But it's what you do. We just started the race and got on with it. In a sense that was our job. ""Every driver has a right to say no and not compete but if you said that individually, as Lauda and others did in Fuji, in some quarters that would be considered: 'Are you a racing driver or are you a racing driver?'"" An intrinsic element of fearless machismo may well help drive today's racers as they line up on the grid for the Russian Grand Prix. The Sochi Autodrom, built around the Sochi Olympic Park on the Black Sea coast, will present a fresh and completely different challenge but there will be inevitable distractions from Suzuka. ""It's not easy,"" says Brabham. ""When they go to Russia to race there will be a lingering thought about the accident. ""I know from my experience in 1994 how difficult it can be. You still do your job but there's a little bit of edge that could be missing. ""The minds in Formula One won't be as clear as they normally are."" It has been 20 years since the sport's last fatalities when Senna and Ratzenberger lost their lives in consecutive days at Imola. That dark weekend prompted a sea change in F1's safety standards, a process which is ongoing. Helmet safety improved with Head and Neck Support (HANS) devices made obligatory while run-off areas at the tracks were increased and many corners were modified to reduce G-forces, for example. But Watson argues such vast improvements in safety have dulled the fear factor of today's F1 heroes. ""In our day it was an occupational hazard,"" says Watson of facing the reality of a potentially fatal accident. ""We never knew one day or the next if we would be a victim or just roll on to the next race. ""Because of the incredible safety improvements, the ferocity of some of the accidents in contrast to the lack of fatality and serious injury is incredible. ""Today's generation have seen massive accidents and the driver is able to walk away and return to his car for the next race. ""The side effect of this is that it's created a sense of indestructibility in the minds of some of the drivers, if not all of them. ""They've got such good safety facilities and car safety. So they feel, not bulletproof but as close to that as you can become."" Bianchi's accident has proved that may no longer be the case and that reality may still be being absorbed by the drivers. Felipe Massa, the last F1 racer to suffer a serious injury when he fractured his skull during the 2009 Hungarian GP weekend, visited the Mie General Hospital after the race on Sunday. Before he left the circuit, the Williams driver said he had been ""screaming on the radio... that there was too much water on the track."" The drivers will gather together in Sochi for their usual pre-event meeting and Bianchi's accident will surely be high on the agenda. The FIA said it has also started its own investigation into the incident. ""The drivers' concerns are going to be raised by the Grand Prix Drivers' Association and they will want answers as much as the FIA do,"" Watson explains. ""It will be analyzed beyond navel gazing because it is a serious issue to understand what occurred. ""Was there fault with any of the parties? Were the protocols strictly observed? Did someone not respect the protocols? That applies to Bianchi as much as it does to the corner workers retrieving the car and the flag marshals."" There is another cold reality in Russia -- the wheels of Formula One will continue to roll. Less than 24 hours after Bianchi's accident, photos appeared and statuses changed on social media as the F1 community arrived in Russia for the next race. Marussia has asked for ""patience and understanding"" as it copes with the fallout of Bianchi's accident. The team, which has Russian backers, is yet to announce if it will run a replacement for Bianchi in Sunday's race. ""Be under no misunderstanding, I imagine Marussia's phone was ringing off the hook with drivers with budgets wanting to drive that car this weekend,"" comments Watson. ""It's a reality of life. ""As sad as this is for Jules Bianchi, a fine young man, who in my view probably didn't do anything wrong. ""He's there fighting for his life and the team have to get on with the job of running two cars on Sunday."" Brabham, who combines racing with a long-term plan to bring the famous Brabham marque back to motorsport, is philosophical about what will drive F1 and its main protagonists this weekend. ""Life either gives you pain when you think about something or it doesn't,"" he says. ""There is always a respect of the risk involved [in racing] but you have to be firm in your mind about what it is you're trying to achieve. ""Things happen for reasons that sometimes you don't understand, yet there are many things to learn from those experiences.""

"(CNN) -- Administrators for the Marussia Formula One team are putting its assets up for sale at auction. A lack of funding saw the team miss the final three races of the 2014 season. After falling into administration, Marussia ceased trading on November 7 with around 200 staff losing their jobs. The team is still named on the official entry list for the 2015 season, which begins in Australia on March 15, but a new buyer has yet to be found. The online auction, organized by administrators FRP Advisory, is another death knell for the team's ambitions to re-join the grid. A source close to the process said that efforts to find a new buyer are continuing but that there was nothing to prevent next week's auction going ahead. It is understood that an investor was close to finalizing a deal to buy Marussia on the eve of the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. But the source added it would now take a ""last-minute miracle"" to find another new buyer and call off the auction. The Caterham F1 team, which entered the sport at the same time as Marussia in 2010 season, is also in administration and searching for a new injection of funds. Caterham used crowd funding to raise enough cash to race in Abu Dhabi but that is not a realistic funding option for a full season, which costs at least $70m. Meanwhile, the administrators for Marussia are focused on generating funds through next week's auction to pay the team's creditors. The live online sale of Marussia's assets takes place on December 16 and 17 through the auctionhq.com website. The plight of the Marussia team gives motorsport collectors and F1 fans a unique chance to get their hands on some amazing pieces of F1 kit. The star lot is the 2013 race car -- although with a dummy engine, gearbox and steering wheels its new owner won't be able to drive home in it. A functioning steering wheel from the 2010 car, a collection of exhaust parts, alloy wheels and a gearbox assembly, including suspension arms and brake calipers, are also some of the mechanical goodies up for grabs. There is also a chance to buy driver Max Chilton's race suit and a collection of team shirts and baseball caps. The ""Everything Must Go"" sale also includes more mundane items such as the reception desk from the factory's headquarters in England, cordless drills and storage shelves. A signed photograph of injured racer Jules Bianchi competing at the Monaco Grand Prix lends a note of poignancy to the auction. The Frenchman collected the first ever points for Marussia this season by finishing ninth at the race around the streets of Monte Carlo but the 25-year-old is now battling severe head injuries. Bianchi crashed in difficult conditions during October's Japanese Grand Prix and is now being treated at a French hospital. While the online auction of Marussia assets presents a chance to buy some very special Christmas presents for the F1 fan in your life, the team will be hoping for some festive good cheer -- and a last-minute buyer.","The defunct Marussia Formula One team is selling its assets in an online auction .

"(CNN) -- By now, everyone knows who Malala Yousafzai is. But most people had never heard of the heroic and highly effective work of her fellow Nobel Peace Prize winner, Kailash Satyarthi. By awarding the prize jointly to both of them, the Nobel Committee made an inspired choice. The win by Malala, who has become a global icon and a symbol of courage and of the rights of girls to an education, was expected, even demanded by the public. In contrast, Satyarthi, a children's rights and anti-slavery activist, is known mostly in the world of human rights defenders. It's time his story started inspiring all of us. The two are, above all, enemies of injustice. And while Malala's young life has dazzled the world in a short time, Satyarthi, 60, has already spent decades working to combat the shocking reality that even today, millions of children are forced to work in slavery, often to pay off their parents' debts, enduring exploitation and trafficking. As noted by Thorbjoern Jagland, the head of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, the shared Nobel, awarded to an Indian and a Pakistani, a Hindu and a Muslim -- natives of two countries that have gone to war with each other -- sends a strong message of reconciliation. But if Malala's uncommon courage is difficult to replicate -- she redoubled her efforts after being shot in the head by the Taliban -- Satyarthi's life is a reminder that there is a potential hero hiding within every human being. And it underscores how as individuals we don't have to accept the wrongs we see in the world as if they were inescapable and unchangeable. Satyarthi is said to have been only 6 years old when he noticed a boy on the steps at his school. But this boy was working shining shoes. This was, according to Satyarthi, when his conscience was awoken. By the time he was 11, as one writer notes, he was pushing his classmates to donate their textbooks to the poor and their parents to help pay school fees for those who couldn't afford them. There was always a profoundly practical aspect to his activism. It was about getting results. Satyarthi eventually became an electrical engineer, but he decided to leave that behind and dedicate himself to something he believed was more important, and he started working to free the so-called ""bonded laborers,"" essentially slaves forced to work to pay off debts. In 1980, he founded Bachpan Bachao Andolan, Save the Children Mission, to rescue and protect children from servitude and trafficking. He built an ashram, the Liberation Retreat, to teach new skills to former slave workers, so they could become self-sufficient after gaining their freedom. BBA started as a direct-action group and evolved into the cornerstone of a global movement to free children from slave labor and give them the chance of having not just a real childhood but also the chance of a decent life. According to the Hindustan Times, it grew to have more than 80,000 people and 750 member organizations. By some counts they have freed more than 75,000 children from servitude and have raised awareness of the problem and developed a wide-ranging strategy to solve it. Child labor -- modern slavery -- is now recognized internationally as a fundamental human rights challenge. Satyarthi's Global March against Child Labor and the Global Campaign for Education have chapters throughout the world, with thousands of members working to influence and ultimately persuade governments, businesses and consumers to stop illegal labor practices. They also help develop international conventions on children's rights so that what is clearly immoral is also designated as illegal. They have, to put it quite simply, made a difference. Malala Yousafzai and Kailash Satyarthi stand as symbols of the crucial role individuals must play to address the urgent issues of our time. Their joint Nobel Peace Prize reminds us that in the great struggles unfolding today, the fight against extremism, the oppression and exploitation of women, the battle between competing ideologies, all of us can make the choice. Everyone can become a hero.","Kailash Satyarthi is announced co-winner of Nobel Peace Prize .

"Capital One wants to know what's in your wallet.  It also wants to know your address, so its representatives can come visit if you owe money. At least, those are the accusations leveled at the credit card giant this week. At first blush, it seems that Capital One would be barred from this activity by federal law.  Specifically, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act outlaws even less-intrusive behavior. Under the act, debt collectors are prohibited from making repeated phone calls, calling before 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m., or even calling at times the collector should have known are inconvenient. Certainly, the debt collection act would frown upon showing up at a debtor's home.  It would.  The problem is, the act protects debtors against abusive collection tactics by third-party debt collectors and debt buyers only.  It does not apply to the original creditor. There's nothing in the debt collection act that prevents Capital One from showing up at your home: In fact, the law doesn't prevent the original creditor from doing anything.  As long as no other law bars this activity, the parties -- consumer and credit card company -- appear to be free to enter into a contract. Capital One's rules said customers can be contacted by mail, phone, e-mail or ""personal visit."" Does that mean consumers can unwittingly agree to their credit card company showing up at their door because they missed a payment? Modern contract law is on a collision course with technology.  Historically, contracts have been paper,  detailed in a reasonable number of pages.  The expectation that a consumer would read an entire contract was not unreasonable.  Today, the price of existing in the modern world is hastily clicking our assent to an endless number of ""clickwrap"" agreements, often dozens of pages long, where you simply scroll through and check a box to complete your purchase. Sure, you can read all the fine print, if you have an extra four hours a day.  And if you don't agree with Section 109(g)(3) of some online purchase agreement, you can refuse to click -- but then again, who loses?  Now, you can't order those commemorative plates or pair of shoes for delivery.  None of these contract terms is negotiable.  They are all ""take it or leave it.""  Because we all depend on the Internet to a large extent for goods and services, most of us grit our teeth and agree -- Section 109(g)(3) and all. Contract law has been slow to acknowledge this reality.  Courts have upheld these online ""agreements"" based on the contract principles that consumers should read every page of an agreement before they sign it.  That advice is still sound today -- but is it reasonable?  Is the only other option to wander the Earth as the lone Luddite, disconnected from progress and civilization?  Perhaps contract law should intervene to prevent the mega-corporation from sneaking or forcing contract terms upon an unsuspecting public. But wait.  The social implications of this suggestion are equally ominous: Are we entering an era where citizens cannot be expected to take responsibility for the contracts they enter into?  On one hand, it seems wrong that corporations, with their legal teams, should be permitted to impose 50 pages of one-sided terms upon the average Joe.  On the other hand, have we the people gotten to the point where we aren't competent enough to be responsible for the contracts we willingly sign? We the people apparently are not alone.  Even Capital One doesn't understand its contracts.  Capital One was quick to release a statement saying that it does not visit cardholders, nor does it send debt collectors to homes or offices. Capital One will maintain that the credit card rules sent to cardholders have the same language as those sent to anyone who buys a car or sports vehicle through a secured loan from the bank.  If those buyers default, Capital One has acknowledged that its representatives might actually visit those homes to repossess.  That's fine, but why did the cardholders receive the same contracts? The bank is considering creating two separate agreements because this language doesn't apply to the general cardholder base.  That's fine, but why did the change come only after bad press? Notice one common theme?  All the misunderstandings, the accidents and the oversights seem to accrue to the benefit of Capital One.  Coincidence?  Accident? I'm sure it is.  Credit card companies always have their customers' best interests at heart. And if you're not convinced, just ask them ... when they ring your doorbell.","Capital One cardholder contract said it can make a ""personal visit"" if you owe money .

"(CNN) -- It's a club that has built its reputation on developing some of the world's best players, but leading European club Barcelona has been hit by a transfer ban imposed by FIFA after breaking the world governing body's rules relating to the ""international transfer of minors."" Barca's youth players are drawn not just from Catalonia and Spain, but also from around the globe and trying to recruit the world's best is a competitive business -- Argentine Lionel Messi joined Barca at the age of 11. If you get the development of young players right it can be a hugely lucrative business. In June Barcelona said of the 25 players in its first team, 17 came its youth academy -- the highest percentage of recent years. Unless it manages to successfully appeal the FIFA ban, Barca will be prevented from signing players -- both youth and senior players -- in the next two transfer windows. That could have severe consequences for the Spanish champions. Transfer windows are important for all clubs as they allow them to refresh their squads. That's important not just for maintaining on-field competitiveness but also for marketing purposes, such as selling shirts. Last summer, for example, Barca invested nearly $120 million on just one player -- Brazilian international Neymar. Later Wednesday on its website, Barcelona said it would appeal the ruling, citing 14 reasons, and take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport if necessary. ""FCB will also demand the relevant interim measures needed to preserve the Club's rights, amongst which are those allowing it to sign players in transfer windows,"" it said in a statement. The FIFA ruling comes after an investigation found the Spanish champions had broken regulations regarding the transfer of young players from outside Spain. FIFA's investigation focused on several players aged under 18 who were registered and played for the club between 2009 and 2013. Under FIFA laws, clubs are not allowed to sign international players under the age of 18 unless the player is moving within the European Union, is aged between 16 and 18 and moving with their parents or the club and the player both live within 50 kilometers of a shared national border. ""The Disciplinary Committee regarded the infringements as serious and decided to sanction the club with a transfer ban at both national and international level for two complete and consecutive transfer periods, together with a fine of CHF 450,000 ($508,000),"" read a FIFA statement. ""Additionally, the club was granted a period of 90 days in which to regularize the situation of all minor players concerned. ""The investigations concerned several minor players who were registered and participated in competitions with the club over various periods between 2009 and 2013."" The Spanish Football Federation has also been hit with a CHF 500,000 ($565,000) fine by FIFA. The Spanish Federation was not immediately available for comment. The ban on Barcelona means the club will be unable to buy players during the ""summer"" transfer window which runs between June and August, and the January 2015 window. ""In this respect, the Disciplinary Committee emphasized that the protection of minors in the context of international transfers is an important social and legal issue that concerns all stakeholders in football,"" continued the statement. ""The Disciplinary Committee underlined that FIFA takes the protection of minors in football very seriously."" It is unclear whether the ban will affect transfers Barca have in the pipeline. German goalkeeper Andre Ter Stegen has reportedly been linked with a move to Barca from Borussia Monchengladbach this summer, while highly-rated 17-year-old Alen Halilovic is set to arrive at the Camp Nou from Dinamo Zagreb. This is not the first negative story that has threatened to derail Barca's season. President Sandro Rosell resigned in January after a judge ordered a hearing to investigate the misappropriation of funds during the signing of Brazil star Neymar in 2013. Neymar was on the scoresheet as Barca drew 1-1 with Atletico Madrid in Tuesday's European Champions League quarterfinal first leg.

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- The last bit of news I heard before boarding a plane to Seoul a few days ago was that North Korea had just fired 100 artillery shells into the sea near the border with South Korea. Disturbing news from North Korea comes just as often as stories that make us laugh in disbelief. The many quirky, mystifying, baffling developments in Pyongyang make its young ruler, Kim Jung Un, an irresistible target for comedians. It was hard to suppress a laugh, for example, when North Korea severely declared that an upcoming satirical Hollywood movie constituted ""an act of war"" and filed an official complaint with the United Nations. Those are two sides of North Korea -- deliberately frightening and inadvertently comical. Then there's a third side -- the part that makes us gasp in horror. A yearlong investigation conducted by the United Nations found that North Korea is a country whose depth of brutality ""does not have any parallel in the contemporary world."" According to the report, North Korea engages in murder, torture, slavery and mass starvation to terrorize the population into submission. Stories from refugees who have escaped from North Korea are a chilling reminder that the regime is not just a military threat, it is causing a terrible humanitarian crisis. North Korea is a Riddle Kingdom that is simultaneously threatening, bizarre and brutal. The regime's unpredictability is one of the factors that allow a small, impoverished state, unable to feed its own people, to stand toe to toe with much more powerful rivals. It is those random, capricious, frequently dangerous behaviors that allow fragile, brittle, bankrupt North Korea to force its dazzlingly successful neighbor, South Korea, to maintain a constant state of alert, to wonder if its capital city can survive an attack across a border that lies just 35 miles away. With its conventional and nuclear arsenals, North Korea manages to keep the international community, including the United States, scrambling for an approach that might neutralize the danger and send a lifeline to the victims of the cruel regime. It's tempting to ignore North Korea's antics as bluster, as empty threats. But Pyongyang has launched deadly attacks. For example, in 2010, it bombed a South Korean island about 70 miles from Seoul, killing four people. It may also have launched a torpedo that same year which sank a South Korean navy ship, killing 46. In 2013, the North detonated a nuclear device and brazenly threatened to launch a ""pre-emptive nuclear attack"" against the U.S. A fourth nuclear test could be imminent. After the most recent escalation, South Korean President Park Geun-hye spoke to military leaders and told them to prepare to retaliate. She described Pyongyang as so erratic that you cannot see ""even an inch ahead."" The news from North Korea can be so disconcerting that spoofs and rumors regularly make it into the news and social media as if they were fact. Ahead of the World Cup finals a satirical video purportedly showing a North Korean newscast declaring the North's team a finalist for the World Cup went viral, repeated as if it were true, as just another amusing moment from Pyongyang. And, why not? Truth and fiction are hard to tell apart. Pyongyang has created its own version of the world for domestic consumption. North Korean government researchers announced their country is the second happiest in the world -- second only to China. The late ruler, Kim Jung Il, was reported to have bowled a perfect game the first time he set foot on a bowling alley. He was also supposedly the world's best golfer. The official biography of the country's rulers has looked like something out of a Marvel Comics book story. No official biography of the current Kim has been released, other than an account that says he was ""born in heaven."" That would fit with his father, Kim Jong Il's official story, which claims he was born under a double rainbow with the seasons spontaneously changing and a new star appearing in the sky for the occasion. The three generations of Kim men who have ruled the North are painted as supernatural to the local population. Abroad, they are cartoonish figures, whose behavior can leave diplomats and strategists scratching their heads. Just a few months ago, the government published a gasp-inducing racist tirade against President Barack Obama, calling him a ""clown"" who ""does not even have the basic appearance of a human being."" It suggested he live with monkeys in a zoo. Racism, a myth of racial superiority, is a striking feature of the culture promoted by the regime. The authorities have created their own reality, brainwashed the population to keep the state functioning and the regime secure. To anyone who commits what the government deems an infraction, the punishment is inconceivably harsh. It's all part of the riddle that keeps the world guessing, off-balance and nervous. By firing missiles, threatening neighbors and acting erratically, North Korea portrays itself as mysterious and volatile, and even that perception magnifies its ability to create fear, adding to its power and helping keep the despotic regime in control.","North Korea had fired artillery shells into the sea near the border with South Korea .

"(CNN) -- For all of the rhetoric about Christianity being under attack in this country, oftentimes it feels no one does a better job of hurting Christianity than the people who call themselves Christians. Especially after a national tragedy. For example, after the September 11 terror attacks, Jerry Falwell blamed the ACLU, as well as feminists, gays and lesbians, for lifting God's veil of protection. After Hurricane Katrina, Pastor John Hagee said he believed God caused the largest natural disaster in U.S. history to stop a gay pride parade in New Orleans. Bodies were still being recovered from the 2010 earthquake in Haiti when Pat Robertson said the country was struck because it made a ""pact to the devil."" And just this weekend, as the nation is trying to heal from the theater shootings in Aurora, Colorado, Jerry Newcombe, a spokesman for the evangelical group Truth in Action, took time out of his day to inform mourners that some of their loved ones were going to hell. His comments were made after U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican, said he believed the shootings happened because Christianity is under attack. He then wondered why ""you know, with all those people in the theater, was there nobody that was carrying? That could have stopped this guy more quickly?"" Carrying a gun, of course. That's right -- a congressman who sits on the House Judiciary Committee is talking about a shootout in a dark room filled with tear gas and panicked, innocent people. And we ask ourselves why Congress is so dysfunctional. This past winter,Sen. Rick Santorum, a devout Roman Catholic who made his faith central to his presidential bid, blamed higher education for the declining number of young people who identify as Christians. This might have struck young people looking at Santorum's three degrees as ... curious. Dare I say, hypocritical? Hysterical? Dumb? As in ignoring that Haiti sits on two seismic fault lines, but choosing to go with the pact-with-the-devil-to-explain-the-earthquake kind of dumb. Of course, people of various faiths, agnostics and atheists make questionable statements all the time. The difference is this mantra of an ""attack on religious freedom"" is most often repeated by politicians and religious leaders of the Christian faith, usually when a political discussion about marriage or women's reproductive health is taking place. I'm fine with that. But I have a problem when a disaster claims innocent victims or causes a great deal of pain and loss, and instead of showing compassion, these so-called leaders of faith say the gays did it. Or the liberals. Or that gem Falwell served up -- the ACLU. That kind of rhetoric not only violates Christ's greatest commandment -- to love -- but is completely illogical. As a Christian, I understand the importance of faith. But Jesus did not say you have to be illogical or inhumane to be a person of faith. Newcombe and others like him would remember that, I doubt he would have chosen the day after the Aurora shooting to tell mourners their loved ones are burning in hell. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: People who call themselves Christians can hurt the faith the most .

"(CNN) -- Marvel announced a huge slate of forthcoming films at a Tuesday news conference -- including a two-part ""Avengers,"" ""Infinity War"" -- but left out a bit of ""Strange"" information fans were waiting for. At an enthusiastic gathering at Hollywood's El Capitan Theatre, Marvel chief Kevin Feige reeled off announcements for a new Captain America film, a ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" sequel and the two-part Avengers adventure. The company also plans to introduce some of its other characters on the big screen, including Black Panther, Captain Marvel and the Inhumans. Although a ""Doctor Strange"" film was announced, Marvel didn't bring out Benedict Cumberbatch, who has been widely rumored to be in negotiations to play the powerful magician. Benedict Cumberbatch reportedly to play Doctor Strange . ""We're opening up an entire new corner of the (Marvel) cinematic universe: the mystical,"" Feige said. ""Doctor Strange"" is scheduled for release November 4, 2016. The character was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko and made his first appearance in Strange Tales No. 110 in 1963. He's a former neurosurgeon who rises to become the Sorcerer Supreme and protect the planet from magical threats. Scott Derrickson is set to direct. ""Strange"" wasn't the only film to get a spot on the Marvel calendar. The new Captain America film, ""Captain America: Civil War,"" will be released May 6, 2016. A ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" sequel is slated for May 5, 2017, and the next Thor movie will come out in July 2017. ""Black Panther"" will follow in November 2017, ""Captain Marvel"" in July 2018 and ""The Inhumans"" in November 2018. Captain Marvel will be a female superhero, the alter ego of Carol Danvers. Marvel tweeted concept art for ""Black Panther."" In addition, Marvel announced a two-part ""Avengers"" film, ""Avengers: Infinity War,"" due in 2018 and 2019. ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" the sequel to 2012's ""The Avengers,"" comes out in 2015. Its trailer has already lit up the Internet. Feige said Marvel's plans -- and the opportunity to make a big announcement -- have been the works for a while. ""We wanted to do this at Comic-Con this year, and things were not set: 'Civil War' wasn't set; 'Guardians of the Galaxy' wasn't out yet."" he said. ""Guardians,"" which came out in August, is the biggest-grossing film of the year. Robert Downey Jr., who plays Iron Man, and Chris Evans, who plays Captain America, were on hand for the presentation, along with Chadwick Boseman, who will play Black Panther. ""I'm blessed to be a part of this Marvel universe, and I'm looking forward to making magic happen,"" Boseman said. The actor portrayed Jackie Robinson in last year's ""42"" and recently played James Brown in ""Get On Up."" However, Cumberbatch was a no-show. ""If it were confirmed, we would have introduced him today,"" Feige said at the news conference. Cumberbatch is currently on a hot streak. In addition to his well-received ""Sherlock"" series, for which he won an Emmy this year, he's earned a great deal of Oscar buzz for his performance as cyberpioneer Alan Turing in ""The Imitation Game,"" a drama about World War II codebreakers.","""Avengers: Infinity War"" part of Marvel slate leading to 2019 .

"(CNN) -- Two movies that pushed limits -- ""Boyhood"" and ""Birdman"" -- were among the leaders for the 21st Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards nominations. The nominations were announced Wednesday morning. ""Boyhood"" was filmed over the course of 12 years and followed its lead, Ellar Coltrane, from the age of 6 through his adolescence. The film, which was nominated for best ensemble -- the SAG Awards' equivalent of Oscar's best picture -- also earned nominations for Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette, who play Coltrane's parents. Thanks to some technical wizardry, ""Birdman"" looks as if it consists of a single shot, showing Michael Keaton as a once high-flying superhero actor who's trying to rebuild his career with a Broadway play. Keaton, who has earned wide praise for his performance, earned a best male actor nomination, Edward Norton received a best supporting male actor nod, and Emma Stone, who plays Keaton's daughter, picked up a nod for best supporting female actor. The film was nominated for best ensemble. One of Stone's fan Twitter accounts picked up on the nomination right away and congratulated her co-stars. ""Congrats to Michael Keaton & Edward Norton on their #SAGAwards nominations #BirdmanMovie,"" tweeted Emma Stone Fan. ""The Theory of Everything,"" a biopic about physicist and mathematician Stephen Hawking, received three nominations. Other nominees for best ensemble include ""The Imitation Game"" and ""The Grand Budapest Hotel."" Complete list of nominees . The SAG Awards are closely watched by awards season observers since they provide an early indication of what the performers themselves -- who make up the largest bloc of Academy Award voters -- believe are the top performances of the year. As such, they're noted as much for what didn't make it as for what did. ""Selma,"" the drama about the 1965 civil rights march, was shut out, as was ""Unbroken,"" the Angelina Jolie-directed version of Laura Hillenbrand's bestselling book about prisoner of war Louis Zamperini. Nomination highlights . On the other hand, the SAG Awards aren't kidding when they highlight ensembles, which may be one reason that Wes Anderson's ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" -- a film bursting with colorful cameos -- was included among the best ensemble nominees, though its lead, Ralph Fiennes, didn't get a best male actor nomination. Other films received plaudits for specific performances. Though ""Foxcatcher,"" a drama about troubled heir John du Pont, didn't get an ensemble nomination, both Steve Carell -- who plays du Pont -- and Mark Ruffalo did earn nods for their performances. ""Whiplash,"" about a brutal music instructor and his student, received a nomination for J.K. Simmons' performance as the instructor. Twitterer Lana Walker was already wondering whether Simmons was going to go all the way. ""Is there any HOPE for any other supporting actor outside of #JKSimmons for #WhiplashMovie for the Oscar @TheAcademy ???"" she tweeted. Perennial awards frontrunner Meryl Streep did not disappoint, picking up a nomination for her performance as the Witch in ""Into the Woods."" It was the film's only nomination. Jake Gyllenhaal's creepy performance as a videographer in ""Nightcrawler"" was also recognized. Benedict Cumberbatch did particularly well in the SAG Awards nominations. Not only is he up in two categories -- best male actor in a film for ""The Imitation Game"" and best male actor in a miniseries or TV movie for ""Sherlock: The Last Vow"" -- ""The Imitation Game"" itself snagged a pick for ensemble. Ruffalo, who was nominated for ""Foxcatcher"" and TV's ""The Normal Heart,"" pulled off the same trick. Carell was quick to congratulate him. ""Congratulations @markruffalo on his two @SAGawards nominations!"" he tweeted. And Jennifer Aniston, who hasn't been on many handicappers' sheets, earned a best female actor nomination for her performance in the little-seen ""Cake."" She plays a woman in a chronic pain support group who looks into the death of a cohort. ""This is the best 6:00 a.m. wake up call ever. Words can't describe how blessed I feel to be recognized like this by my peers for this film. What an enormous feeling of joy and gratitude,"" Aniston said in a statement. 'Big Bang,' 'Game of Thrones' among TV nominees . The SAG Awards also go out to TV shows, and the list of comedies and dramas won't surprise anybody who watches the Emmys. The nominees for best ensemble in a drama are ""Boardwalk Empire,"" ""Downton Abbey,"" ""Game of Thrones,"" ""Homeland"" and ""House of Cards."" The nominees for best ensemble in a comedy are ""The Big Bang Theory,"" ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"" ""Modern Family,"" ""Orange Is the New Black"" and ""Veep."" Among the television performers earning nominations were Louis C.K. (""Louie""), Edie Falco (""Nurse Jackie""), Amy Poehler (""Parks and Recreation""), Viola Davis (""How to Get Away with Murder"") and both leads of ""True Detective,"" Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey. Picking among dramas will be particularly hard, tweeted Adriana Schneider. In a response to a question from CNN's Entertainment account, she said, ""awwwww crap three really great shows I love up for the same award."" Ansel Elgort and Eva Longoria made the announcement of the nominations Wednesday. The 21st Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards will air on TBS and TNT on January 25.

"Like millions of Americans, I was glued to the Olympic Games over the weekend. I loved, simply loved, Ashley Wagner's strong, athletic performance on ice to one of my favorite songs from Pink Floyd. Truth told, I loved her pre-competition comments more. She told NBC, ""People see figure skaters as these pretty little porcelain dolls that you put up on a shelf.  But I am not a soft skater, and I don't want to be.  I am strong; I'm powerful; I'm athletic.  Most importantly to me I feel like I'm a woman out on the ice."" Powerful. Athletic. A woman. Beautiful words in a world that denigrates female power by using phrases like, ""man up,"" ""girlie men"" and the ""feminization of our culture.""  And, I might add: What is wrong with that anyway? Last time I checked, roughly half our culture was already as such. I simply don't equate ""feminine"" or ""girly"" with ""weakness."" But, plenty of others -- men and women -- do. Conservative Fox News analyst Britt Hume recently blamed a ""sort of feminized atmosphere"" for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's woes. It seems, in Hume's mind, our overly sensitive culture can no long abide a ""masculine, muscular"" guy like Christie. Arnold Schwarzenegger urged the crowd at the Republican National Convention in 2004 to support free enterprise and to not be ""economic girlie men."" Yes, he was capitalizing on his Hollywood image, but the phrase drew a standing ovation. Even strong women inadvertently slam female strength. Sarah Palin urged the GOP to ""man up"" in 2010 and support Tea Party candidates. Why didn't Palin shout, ""woman up?"" I know, I know. I've used the ""man up"" slam too. It's fun, cutting and effective. But, upon further reflection, is it? I love my friend Kelly's story about ""girlie men."" Nine months pregnant, and standing in line at Dunkin' Donuts behind two male construction workers, she overheard one of them say to the other, ""You're such a girl."" Kelly, exhausted from getting up at 2:30 a.m. to arrive at work on time snapped, ""Then I'm sure he's stronger than you."" I don't mean to pick on Republicans, but perhaps the use of ""man up,"" ""girlie men"" and ""the feminization of our culture"" are hurting them needlessly. According to a new CNN/ORC poll, a majority of Americans, and women in particular, do not believe the Republican Party understands the problems and concerns of women today. As Republican Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington state told CNN: ""When you look at our position on issues, a lot of times (a) majority of Americans agree with our positions. But it's the way that we talk about it that doesn't resonate, and we have to do a better job. I think it's fair to say there have been some comments which are offensive and they're not representative of the entire Republican Party."" Which brings me back to the Olympics. For the first time ever, women will compete in ski jumping. They've been petitioning to compete in the Games since 1998. If you're wondering why it's taken 16 years, a hint: According to The New York Times, the president of the International Ski Federation, Gian-Franco Kasper, told NPR in 2005 that ski jumping ""seems not to be appropriate for ladies from a medical point of view. Silly manly man.","Carol Costello says Olympic skater Ashley Wagner calls herself a strong, athletic woman .

"The Occupy Wall Street protest may be the answer to a favorite question of social scientists ever since the bank bailouts of 2008 -- where is the social movement? Americans are famously willing to tolerate a relatively large amount of income inequality (especially compared to our European counterparts).  Americans love meritocracy, and are typically quite happy to see hard work rewarded, even to the tune of millions of dollars, as is often the case on Wall Street. But there is a catch — we want the rules of the game to be fair. Recent scandals involving Wall Street banks and financial institutions, headed by some of the world's most well-paid managers, executives and analysts, have many Americans asking themselves whether this game is rigged. It is this sense of injustice, coupled with economic insecurity, that animates changes in Americans' attitudes toward Wall Street. It's not just a small number of Americans, those who are actually ""occupying"" Wall Street, who feel such injustice. That's just the tip of the iceberg. In a paper forthcoming in the journal Public Opinion Quarterly, I examine Americans' attitudes toward banks, financial institutions and Wall Street over the last 40 years and look at historical trends in how Americans perceive the honesty and ethical practices of bankers. Animosity toward Wall Street is at its highest level in at least 40 years. Americans have never exactly loved Wall Street stockbrokers or bankers—but we certainly didn't always hate them. Why this increasing hostility? The answer is a ""perfect storm"" of financial turmoil and a series of major scandals on Wall Street. The public has been down on big Wall Street banks and financial institutions for some time now.  The General Social Survey, administered by the National Opinion Research Council, has asked Americans about their confidence in banks and financial institutions since 1973. Between March of 2006 and March of 2010, the percent of Americans with a great deal of confidence in banks and financial institutions plummeted 19 percentage points, from 30 percent to an all-time low of 11 percent.  According to a similar trend from Harris Interactive, the percent of Americans with a great deal of confidence in the people running Wall Street had already reached an all-time low of just 4 percent by February of 2009.  These figures are not just a reflection of Americans' dissatisfaction with the size of their bank accounts — they also reflect the increasing belief that Wall Street is playing a game that only the bankers can win. Economic hard times, such as global recessions, do tend to bring about small, but noticeable drops in the public's confidence in Wall Street, just as we might expect falling confidence in a military that is losing a war. But when economic downturns coincide with major scandals, as in the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s and our current dilemma, the biggest changes in public confidence result — changes that may have contributed to the protests we are seeing on Wall Street today. In other words, Americans really begin to get angry when there is evidence of systematic foul play. To be sure, material hardships such as unemployment rates in the 9 percent range and the continuing high levels of foreclosures and bankruptcies undoubtedly set the stage for a public outcry. But this outcry has a distinctly moral tenor. The sentiments of the Occupy protestors holding signs reading ""Blame Wall Street Greed,"" ""People not Profits"" and ""Wall Street was the Real Weapons of Mass Destruction"" certainly echo the wider American public's sense of moral indignation. Just 26 percent of Americans in an April 2011 Harris poll thought the people working on Wall Street were ""as honest and moral as other people"" (for a point of comparison, the percentage was 51 in 1997). In that same poll, 67 percent of Americans agreed that ""most people on Wall Street would be willing to break the law if they believed they could make a lot of money and get away with it."" Ultimately, whether Occupy Wall Street is a watershed moment or a momentary disturbance remains to be seen. The key question, however, is whether the bubbling populist outrage evidenced in Occupy's ""We are the 99%"" signs will translate into populist-friendly politics. The Buffett Rule, calling for millionaires to pay taxes at higher rates than their employees, is one, albeit timid (as the political scientist Larry Bartels has recently articulated), indication that the new political calculus involves tapping into this brand of populism. Elizabeth Warren's Senate campaign is another. At minimum, the visibility of the Occupy Wall Street's movement should bring renewed attention to a political and economic issue the majority of Americans on Main Street agree upon—something's not quite right on Wall Street and something has got to be done about it.","Lindsay Owens: Polls show a spike in Americans' lack of confidence in finance .

"Luis Suarez could be the last big-money signing top European club Barcelona makes for quite some time. The Spanish football club has seen its appeal against a ban on buying new players rejected by the sport's global governing body FIFA. Barca plans to appeal the sanction, which prohibits the club from signing any new players until January 2016, at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS.) The punishment was meted out in April, when FIFA ruled Barca had breached rules relating to the transfers of players under the age of 18. ""Barcelona announces that it shall continue defending its interests before the highest sporting authority, in this case the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS),"" read a statement from the club. ""Barcelona may not in any way share a resolution that is an affront to the spirit of our Masia (its youth academy,) a world renowned example of academic, human and sporting education."" Barca was allowed to sign players during the current transfer window, which closes on September 1, after FIFA suspended the ban while the appeal was in progress. The Catalan team spent a reported $128.5 million to sign Uruguay international Suarez from Liverpool. The striker is currently serving a ban for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini while playing for Uruguay at the World Cup. Belgian defender Thomas Vermaelen was brought in from Arsenal for a fee of euros $25m while French defender Jeremy Mathieu and Chilean goalkeeper Claudio Bravo were signed from Valencia and Real Sociedad respectively.

"Can you be pro-life and pro-death penalty? It's a question more than one person I know is asking after Oklahoma's botched execution of Clayton Lockett. Not necessarily because of the way Oklahoma tortuously executed the convicted killer, but because of the hard-core way some reacted to Lockett's execution. Like Mike Christian. The pro-life Oklahoma state representative told The Associated Press, ""I realize this may sound harsh, but as a father and former lawman, I really don't care if it's by lethal injection, by the electric chair, firing squad, hanging, the guillotine or being fed to the lions."" He also threatened to impeach judges who dared delay executions for any reason. This is from a man who is so strongly pro-life he voted for eight bills in four years to prevent women in Oklahoma from terminating their pregnancies, or, as many who oppose abortion say, ""killing babies."" Color me confused. So, Rep. Christian says it's OK to kill, unless you're a woman who wants to end her pregnancy? As I told my friends during a heated debate last weekend, that smacks of hypocrisy. The only nonhypocritical viewpoint, I argued, exists in the Catholic Church. Catholics believe in the ""Consistent Ethic of Life.""  As Georgetown's Father Thomas Reese puts it, ""we are concerned about a person from womb to tomb."" ""Life is something that comes from God and shouldn't be taken away by man,"" Reese told me. Put simply, the Catholic Church opposes abortion and the death penalty. Period. Except nothing in life is that simple. Especially our collective views on the death penalty and abortion. If you ask a Southern Baptist, he or she will likely tell you the Catholic Church is wrong. ""There is no contradiction here,"" R. Albert Mohler, president of The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, told me, referring to Rep. Christian's underlying position. Christian's words were ""careless,"" and don't ""reflect any Biblical ... defense of the death penalty,"" he says, but it does not defy logic if Christian is pro-life and pro-death penalty. ""It's not an eye-for-an-eye kind of thing,"" explained Mohler. ""Retribution is not the same as a demand for justice. In Genesis 9, God speaks to Noah after the flood. When someone takes human life, they forfeit their own life."" So, I asked, ""Should a woman who's had an abortion forfeit her own life?"" Mohler emphatically answered, ""no."" Lockett deserved to die, he said, because the act of murder ""was taken in wanton disregard of the life taken and given the nature of the crime, this individual has forfeited his right to live."" (Lockett not only raped and shot his victim, but ordered his accomplice to bury her alive.) Don't get me wrong; pro-lifers could argue that pro-choice, anti-death penalty believers are inconsistent, too. How can you choose to end life, but adamantly oppose the death penalty? Apparently, consistency is not America's strong suit. According to a 2010 study, only about 8% of Americans oppose abortion and the death penalty under all circumstances. James Unnever, professor of criminology at the University of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee, co-authored the study. He expected his test results to show a consistent belief system in all kinds of premeditated death. In other words, if you believe in the sanctity of life, you would be opposed to euthanasia, the death penalty and abortion. Turned out, that was not remotely true. ""From a religious position, the Catholic faith is the most consistent life ethic,"" Unnever says. ""Religion is only one factor that affects using the death penalty."" The other factor, he says, is politics. ""When you get people who are against abortion and for the death penalty, that's not as much a religious effect as a politics effect. Politics trumps any religion."" Jacinta Gau, professor of criminal justice at the University of Central Florida, co-authored two studies on attitudes about abortion and capital punishment. She was also surprised by the inconsistency many showed toward life issues. Of those who strongly oppose abortion, yet strongly approve of the death penalty, Gau says: ""What seems to link those two attitudes together is related to fundamentalism, a literal interpretation of the Bible, and an inflexible way of viewing society in general,"" Gau says.  ""I'm not sure they really view it as a contradiction.  There's a punitive attitude toward this -- kind of like if you don't want a child, don't engage in risky sexual behavior; if you kill someone, you deserve death."" And Gau says pro-choice, anti-death penalty believers also don't see a contradiction. Those who are pro-choice don't ""see abortion as ending a life,"" she says. ""The death penalty becomes completely separate for the pro-choice people, because it's about a woman's right to choose."" Truth told, the ""Consistent Ethic of Life,"" is relatively new to the Catholic Church. For centuries, the church supported capital punishment. But passionate pro-life and death penalty foes, such as Sister Helen Prejean, convinced the church that ""helping to kill a defenseless person"" in any circumstance is wrong. ""What's more innocent than an unborn baby?"" Prejean told me. ""It's easy to be against that."" Then Prejean went for the jugular. The people who commit terrible crimes, ""Could you kill them? If there's a part of you who can't say yes to that, then you can't say yes to the death penalty."" I must admit I was humbled by Prejean's question. Couple that with the fact we can now lock up violent criminals for life and I, again, find myself arguing for the ""Consistent Ethic of Life."" As for Mohler, the Southern Baptist leader, he offered me this final thought:  ""If I had the opportunity to trade the death penalty for the affirmation of protection of the life of the unborn, I'd take it in a second."" Let the debate rage on.","Carol Costello: Can you be pro-life and pro-death penalty at the same time?

"(CNN) -- Labor Day isn't only a commemoration of American workers -- it's also a reminder of the often oppressive power of employers backed by the law and muscle of the U.S. government. The history of the Labor Day tells the tale. On May 1, 1886, tens of thousands of workers protested in cities all across the United States to demand an eight-hour workday. At the time, most American laborers worked 18- or even 20-hour workdays. But police responded aggressively to the peaceful protests. Two days later, while workers were meeting to plan further protests in Chicago, police showed up and beat and shot at the group at random. Six unarmed workers were killed by the police. The next day, outraged Chicagoans attended what was initially a peaceful protest in Haymarket Square. The peace fell apart near the end, when police advanced on the crowd. Someone who was never identified exploded a bomb and killed a police officer. The cops responded by opening fire on the protesters. In the darkness, about a dozen workers and police were killed. The event influenced the history of labor in America and internationally for years to come. Martial law was declared across the country. The police blamed workers for the violence and, in particular, some Socialist Party labor organizers involved in the protests. Several were tried for murder and convicted. That fall, one man died in his cell and four were executed. In response, all around the world, workers movements adopted May 1 to commemorate the Haymarket Massacre and to symbolize the ongoing fight for worker rights and worker justice. So why doesn't the United States celebrate Labor Day on May 1 as well? On May 11, 1894, again in Chicago, workers at the Pullman Palace Car Co. called for a strike to protest wage cuts and the killing of a worker. In solidarity, the American Railroad Union called for a boycott on working in all Pullman railway cars. Within a matter of days, train traffic west of Detroit ground to a halt. In response, President Grover Cleveland called in the Army to suppress the strikes. Protests broke out. At least 26 people were killed. The government collusion with big business, both in the court system and in the deployment of the military, was unprecedented and severe. The labor community was enraged. And so, the story goes, President Cleveland, realizing he had to do something quick to appease the labor movement, pressed for Labor Day to become a national holiday. But Cleveland worried that tying the holiday to May 1 would encourage Haymarket-like protests and tacitly strengthen communist and socialist movements that had backed the May 1 commemoration around the globe. And so through a twist of choices and coincidences, the first Monday of September was chosen to be the official ""Labor Day"" in the United States. Labor Day, then, shouldn't just serve as a commemoration of the hard work of American laborers and all they have contributed to America's history, infrastructure and prosperity. Labor Day should also serve as a reminder of not only how companies can undervalue and undermine their workers but how our government provide dangerous or even deadly levels of support to bad employers. Even today, we know what it takes to improve the lives and prosperity of America's workers. Unions raise the wages of workers by roughly 20% and raise total compensation --including wages and benefits after union dues are deducted -- by 28%.  Raising the minimum wage helps low wage workers while pumping more spending power into the economy as a whole. And strengthening worker safety laws and other protections is good for workers and for a productive and safe economy. But when some in government, especially Republicans, undermine the ability of workers to form a union or erode wage and safety laws, they're doing the dirty work for big business at the expense of American workers. It's certainly less severe than calling in the Army to defend the profit interests of big corporations, but the effect is the same: Republicans taking the side of CEOs and wealthy shareholders and standing against ordinary working Americans.  Study after study after study -- not to mention the entire history of our economy -- shows what policies are good for ordinary, hardworking Americans. But Republicans, who rhetorically say they support ordinary Americans, consistently stand against these measures and stand for anything that would give more power and leeway to big businesses. When we celebrate Labor Day, we should remember that government isn't always on the side of the American people -- no matter that we have a federal holiday that was created to distract us.","Sally Kohn: Labor Day reminds us of the power of employers, government over workers .

"London (CNN) -- From Selfridges in London to Fifth Avenue in New York', the sight of Chinese shoppers flocking to luxury clothing stores is now a familiar one for many in the West. With its seemingly insatiable appetite for European and American luxury brands, China accounts for more than a quarter of the global luxury market -- and that number is growing, according to market analysts like McKinsey & Co. But the rising fashion credentials of the country's consumers is not the only reason people are talking about China on the sidelines of this season's runway shows in London and Paris. A new, young generation of Chinese fashion designers is causing a stir within stylish circles. Read more: Will Chinese designers get left behind in China's fashion boom? As Paris Fashion Week begins Tuesday, marking the culmination of the fashion world's twice-yearly dash between New York, London, Milan and Paris, these Chinese designers are yet again raising their profile in the traditional style capitals of the world. One of those hoping to show that the flow of sartorial capital not only goes from West to East, but also vice versa, is Haizhen Wang. Originally from Dalian in northeast China, he trained at Central Saint Martins in London, graduating in 2005. Wang then came to the attention of the fashion world last year after winning the Fashion Fringe Award for young designers and was mentored by Burberry's chief creative officer, Christopher Bailey. Like many of the emerging Chinese-born, Western-educated generation of designers, the influence of Wang's home culture on his work is subtle. While his collection was inspired mainly by gothic architecture, Wang says his Chinese roots underlie everything he produces. Read more: 'Made in China' is finally cool . ""Even if you can't see any obvious Oriental influences, like dragons for example, across my pieces, the man who made this collection -- me -- is Chinese and that will always be there, even though I was trained in the West."" Also epitomizing this new generation of Chinese designers is 29 year-old Huishan Zhang. He combines his Western training -- he spent a year with Dior in Paris -- with his Chinese heritage. Tipped by international fashion insiders as the one to watch in 2013, his first collection -- stocked at London boutique Browns -- sold out within a month. Zhang spends several months each year back in China, where he sources all his hand-sewn fabrics from near to where he grew up in Qingdao, on the eastern coast. He says that a big challenge for Chinese designers is convincing people that ""Made in China"" can mean high-quality. ""We are really trying to learn and show people what we are capable of,"" Zhang explains. He says China and the West can learn a lot from each other when it comes to design. Zhang's Autumn-Winter 2013 collection incorporates some noticeable Chinese influences. One piece in particular provides more than a nod to China's recent history. His version of the ""Mao Suit,"" a staple symbol of uniformity under the Communist regime, has been updated with pink lace and diamante buttons and is the center-piece of his collection. Traditionally worn by men, Zhang says the piece partly represents giving ""the power back to the woman and not the man"". As designers like Zhang tap into the changing social norms of Chinese society, so he and others are taking note of the evolving fashion tastes in the country. He notes how much things have changed since the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s when China was largely cut off from the rest of the world. ""We now have this amazing opportunity to get in touch with the whole world,"" Zhang says. He explains that because Chinese people until fairly recently had very limited wardrobes, there is a now a huge hunger there for new fashion. China is now such a key driver of global profit for the fashion industry that Burberry's stock price sank in early February after China announced it would ban advertising of luxury goods. Tom Ford, the designer and film director whose name is almost synonymous with luxury and style, says he is closely watching how Chinese consumers are maturing. Ford observes that -- as in other emerging markets -- China is moving away from the initial lust for designer logos that tends to characterise the newly rich. ""Tastes become quite refined and equalized with the rest of the luxury consumer all over the world ... I think that's really starting to happen in China and it's moving very quickly."" Angelica Cheung, founding editor of Vogue China, agrees that Chinese consumers have been on a huge learning curve over the last decade, and says her magazine has played a significant role in their sartorial education. ""We constantly emphasize the importance in knowing how to appreciate fashion, for example, we educate our readers on the history of couture and the great couturiers,"" Cheung explains. ""These are all aspects that, due to historical circumstance in China, our readers had little exposure to previously."" She adds that niche Chinese designers are doing increasingly well not because of patriotism, but because people appreciate their designs and their quality. Haizhen Wang recognizes that his home country has huge market potential for him, but he feels that he still had to come to Europe in order to create his brand and get the training that would make big buyers take him seriously. ""China's education system has a long way to go before it can produce a designer capable of being a global brand and taking on the international market,"" he says. ""I'm sure one day it will happen though."" Fashion legend Giorgio Armani seems to agree, recently declaring he was sure that sooner or later China would produce a designer who shows in London, Milan and Paris. It might be a while before Beijing Fashion Week is taken as seriously as Paris by the fashion cognoscenti, but industry heavyweights are switching on to the fact that China is now firmly on the front row of global fashion.","Chinese designers raising profiles in the traditional style capitals like London, Paris .

"The recent death of the ""snake-handling"" pastor of a small Pentecostal church in Kentucky has raised an age-old conflict between church and state. Jamie Coots, the pastor of the Full Gospel Tabernacle in Jesus Name in Middlesboro, Kentucky, died after being bitten on his right hand by a rattlesnake during a weekend church service where he was handling rattlesnakes willingly, it seems. It has been reported that the late pastor's son Cody Coots has continued the snake-handling tradition even after his father's death. People handle snakes at church for the same reason that people do lots of things: the Bible tells them so. ""And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover."" Mark 16:17-18 . This biblical passage is the genesis of serpent-handling for churches of the Holiness movement and the Pentecostal Church of God.  For the faithful, those two verses are the authority for dancing with or passing around poisonous snakes during church services. Moreover, if bitten, they are likely to refuse medical treatment and rely upon God to heal them. There's just one problem with this Biblical authority.  Another authority, known as the Commonwealth of Kentucky. In Kentucky, the practice is illegal. Well, barely. Under the applicable section KRS Â§437.060, any person who displays, handles or uses a snake in connection with any religious gathering shall be fined $50 to 100.  Hardly a capital offense.  The Kentucky legislature has sent a message: poisonous snake-handling is marginally illegal -- but not as illegal as drugs or other crimes.  The legislature's assigned penalty appears to fall somewhere between a speeding ticket and an overdue library book. This illegal practice persists so openly that a reality TV show flouts the law by filming a crime in progress.   When a network has a series based primarily on filming people breaking the law in your state, it's fair to say your law has lost some of its bite. Belief Blog: A lethal Appalachian tradition . Ultimately, the issue is whether a state even has authority to regulate a practice that is primarily faith-based. The First Amendment to the United States Constitution declares ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.""  The 14th Amendment, in turn, prohibits state legislatures from doing the same. However, equally as formidable is the state's constitutionally reserved ""police power."" The name itself is a misnomer; the power is much more than your local police officer's ability to make an arrest.  The states' traditional police power is their exclusive authority to regulate the public health, safety and morals of their residents. Kentucky's authority to outlaw snake-handling derives from this police power.  The issue here is whether a state has the power to regulate religious activity; so the two constitutional authorities meet head-to-head. In Jones v. City of Opelika, the Supreme Court addressed the conflict between freedom of religion and the police power of a state. The court articulated an important but still misunderstood concept about religious freedom: the First Amendment embraces two distinct concepts -- the freedom to believe and the freedom to act. The first is absolute, but the second cannot be absolute. This makes sense. Your thoughts alone, without speech or any action, are never criminal, even if of the most prurient, vile nature (at least for now -- once Apple figures out an app to download your thoughts, they may someday be criminalized). Your conduct, on the other hand, can be regulated for the protection of society.  While citizens of the United States have an unlimited right to our religious beliefs, our right to act within those beliefs is tempered by a state's duty to protect its citizens. In Lawson v. Commonwealth, Kentucky's Supreme Court considered a direct challenge to its snake-handling statute, using the guidance of the Supreme Court in the Jones case.  The court held that the state could properly regulate the time, place and manner of religious exercise -- such as passing snakes around at church -- where the regulation is necessary for the safeguarding of the health, good order and comfort of the community. Legally, Kentucky's interest in protecting its residents outweighs a Kentuckian's interest in celebrating his religion by handling rattlesnakes.  According to the courts, the state can prohibit this practice. But Kentucky still barely criminalizes the practice.  Handling poisonous snakes is potentially more dangerous than other regularly prosecuted activities, such as drug use.  Ask yourself: Would you rather your child be at a party where someone is passing around a water bong or a water moccasin? Whatever the reason for not aggressively prosecuting the already-illegal practice, the fact is that it presents a known danger.  Kentucky is one of the states that has seen fit to criminalize the practice, and it has the power to do so. Unfortunately, if Kentucky doesn't exercise its police power and impose stricter penalties, then the snakes will continue to impose their own punishment, which is often the death penalty.","Death of a Kentucky pastor who handled rattlesnakes renews church vs. state issue .

"(CNN)The United Kingdom may seem an unlikely candidate to lead a renewable energy revolution; it doesn't have much sun for solar power, it doesn't have much space for wind power and it doesn't have giant coursing rivers for hydro. It does, however, have thousands of miles of coastline and a lowering and restless sea whose tides ebb and flow with tremendous force. Energy companies in Scotland and Wales are seeing the potential from underwater turbines which tap a constant and predictable source of energy, are invisible and can produce as much electricity as a conventional wind turbine. If a test project in the fast flowing marine waters of Pentland Firth in the far north of Scotland goes well, submerged turbines could eventually power as many as 400,000 Scottish homes, according to the Scottish-government backed scheme. Predictable flow . ""The demonstration array at the moment is 6MW or four turbines. Hopefully this will be the catalyst for further investment,"" MeyGen CEO Dan Pearson told CNN. ""We are looking to complete construction of that in 2016."" Sea water is 832 times denser than air, which means the turbines can be smaller while producing a similar amount of energy to a wind turbine. The force of these tides also means the turbines can be placed closer together, taking up less space on the sea bed than an equivalent wind farm on land. Apart from being invisible -- obviating a factor that has stalled many wind farm projects on land -- the marine turbines have the great advantage of tapping an energy source that does not rely on the weather. Other renewables such as wind, wave, solar and even hydroelectricity depend in large part on seasonal and climatic features, tidal turbines, meanwhile, get two regular tide changes a day. ""We can forecast over the next 100 years pretty accurately -- we know when the power's coming,"" he said. Scrap metal as an anchor . The plan is for the stands for the turbines to be lined up 525 feet (160m) apart and weighted to the sea bed with scrap metal. With a depth of 130ft (40m), Pearson says that vessels would have a clearance of about 8m, plenty, he says, for the small craft that ply the four mile region. ""These are really cut down versions of wind turbines, such that most of the electrical equipment is onshore so that if something goes wrong, we can get a Land Rover and drive to the substation rather than having to get a boat and pick them up. ""That's one of the core advantages of this technology."" Other issues such as maintenance and corrosion have been solved, in large part, by using the advances in other technologies. ""It makes use of a large knowledge base, for example the seals and solutions have been solved by propeller technologies on ships, problems of corrosion are well known from subsea structures like bridges or oil rigs. ""What you're seeing is nothing brand new, it's just a lot of components coming together and I think that's the beauty of it."" Safe for sea life? Concerns over the impact on marine life were also raised during the planning process, but Pearson said the simple fact is the turbines move so slowly -- at between 12-18 RPM -- that experts believe most sea life would be able to either ignore or get out of the way of the blades with ease. ""We've been working closely with institutions such as Scottish Natural Heritage and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds because we have diving birds in the area,"" Pearson said. ""We have seals, we have whales, we have dolphins -- it's beautiful up there."" He said undersea monitors have been logging the wildlife in the region over the past five years and that various groups now have a clear baseline of which animals populate it. ""There has been a lot of work done in other parts of the world on how seals and whales interact with these turbines and they do actually get a bit curious. ""But these rotations of the blades are quite slow in comparison with wind turbines and the theory is that they can just get out of the way. He said research had shown that most marine life avoids tidal surges when they are in full flow. ""I can imagine seals dancing around them, but the only time they'll be playing around them is when the flow is benign -- and that only lasts for about an hour and a half and at that time the blades aren't rotating. ""We don't want to be blasé about it, but at the same time we have a high degree of confidence."" The immediate future of the energy source, he said, was looking good, with leases around Scotland showing the potential to produce 1.2GW -- more than twice the energy produced by an average-sized nuclear power plant. ""The UK has a good chance to develop and manufacture these turbines for world consumption in a beautiful part of the world which currently has a low GDP,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- As a young child in Fiji, rugby star Waisale Serevi strained to hear tales of his heroes through the crackles of an old transistor radio. Those radio waves carried stories of his idols across the seas into the ears of an enraptured Serevi. It was the 1970s, before television arrived on the shores of the tiny island nation cast 1,700 miles off the east coast of Australia in the Pacific Ocean. Although it has a population of just 870,000, Fiji's obsession with the oval ball has helped it stand shoulder-to-shoulder with global superpowers. In Serevi, Fiji gave rugby a player blessed with such flare, flamboyance and outrageous natural talent, that on many an occasion David was able to stun Goliath. ""I started to get interested in rugby in 1977,"" Serevi, who played 36 times for the Fiji's Rugby Union team, told CNN. ""I was in my school uniform in Fiji, and then people were all happy and shouting and I asked my mum, 'why are these people happy?' ""They said, 'Oh Fiji has just beaten the British Lions, and rugby makes people in Fiji happy.' ""So, I thought, if I have an opportunity to play for Fiji, I'll try and make people happy."" Fiji's famous win over the Lions came in the 15-a-side version of the sport but, while Serevi went on to become a member of the International Rugby Board (IRB) Hall of Fame and played at three Rugby World Cups, it was in the seven-a-side game that he excelled. Sevens is a scaled-down, fast-pace version of rugby union that requires quickness of mind and body and bucket loads of stamina. At his peak, Serevi possessed all three in spades, so much so that he was dubbed the ""King of Sevens."" If Serevi was the king, his royal residence was the Hong Kong Sevens -- the most famous date on the HSBC Sevens World Series calendar and a tournament followed religiously in Fiji. ""It's a big burden for the players,"" said Serevi. ""When they come to the Hong Kong Sevens, they have to win to make their name back home in Fiji. ""When Fiji wins the Hong Kong Sevens it's a good 12 months for us until the next Hong Kong Sevens. ""But, when we lose the Hong Kong Sevens, it's the worst 12 months. It's always like 'Oh no we have to wait for another year!'"" Gallery: New Zealand triumph in Hong Kong . Luckily for Serevi, he enjoyed a plethora of successes during his 17-year career, including seven triumphs in Hong Kong. In two of those glorious years, 1997 and 2005, the tournament doubled up as the World Cup Sevens and it's those wins which Serevi remembers most fondly. ""When we won the World Cup Sevens in 1997, the whole people of Fiji, in Fiji and all over the world were so excited,"" he explained. ""In 2005, I was so happy that my little boy was here, he was aged three or four and I carried him and took the cup with him home. ""They even closed the airport because the people were coming in and they wanted to meet the plane coming down from the sky."" At his final Hong Kong Sevens as a player, Serevi illustrated why he is so revered. In the semifinal match against New Zealand in 2007, he received the ball inside Fiji's 22-yard line, proceeding to effortlessly slalom his way through three attempted tackles before off-loading the ball to his teammate on the halfway line. ""I saw the two New Zealand guys were like coming and I went straight to their eyes and I could see they were arriving but their eyes told me that they were gone. That's why I stepped two of them ... they were both tired ... I was running slowly because I didn't have any more energy too and the defenders were coming close. ""I dummied my way and they all went and I went through the middle straight in, and I passed to one of our guys."" Serevi summoned the energy for one last-gasp burst, receiving a final pass before striding to the try line with the ball raised above his head in jubilation. ""I ran nearly 150 meters,"" he recalls. ""I was about to die when I scored the try."" Not bad for a 38-year-old. With his boots now firmly zipped up in his kitbag, the 45-year-old Serevi is focused on finding the next generation of sevens talent. Serevi Rugby was set up in 2010 by the now retired star and three Seattle-based partners. It aims to encourage children into the sport all over the world, with a specific focus on growing rugby in North America. The organization has teamed up with USA Rugby in a bid to find more players like Carlin Isles, a former collegiate track prospect who resisted overtures from the NFL to sign with Scottish rugby team Glasgow Warriors. The aim is for Serevi and USA Rugby to establish a network of training camps from which the country will draw its squads for the Sevens World Series and Olympic competitions, with the sport set to make its Games debut in 2016. ""Rugby has given me a lot,"" reflected Serevi. ""Twenty one years of rugby. I want to give back to rugby so that I can help rugby kids. We started in Seattle and now it's beginning in a lot of other states in the U.S. ... We are going into schools in the U.S., they are getting us to go into elementary schools and take their physical education classes so that we teach the kids how to play.""

"(CNN) -- Birdies are one thing but baboons on the golf course are not quite so welcome. Luke Donald had to dodge a baboon that cut across play at the Nedbank Golf Challenge in Sun City, South Africa. The former world No. 1 jumped out of the way as the large primate bounded between the bunkers during the second round. Donald tweeted afterwards: ""Couple of things happened to me that haven't happened in a while....one I shot 63, and two I let a baboon play through on the course. ""The fact that my caddy Johnnie didn't even flinch makes my reaction look even more pathetic!!"" At least the Englishman can say he was not put off his stroke by the monkey business.

"(CNN) -- Ten years ago, Kayla McAlister was hiding under her bed to avoid going to rugby training with her father and her All Black brother. Today, she is the world's best women's sevens player -- an astonishing achievement given that she took up the sport as recently as late 2012. Now the former netball player has Olympic gold in her sights. ""Rio is why I made the move,"" the New Zealander tells CNN. ""I'd made our provincial team for netball but I was only on the bench that year and the following year I was cut. ""Then the sevens opportunity came up. It wasn't quite a joke but it was a bit of fun. I was approaching my mid-20s and wasn't getting any younger, in a rut and this opportunity came up -- one door shutting and another one opening."" It was her dad, Charlie, a former rugby league professional who played in England and Australia, that spotted New Zealand's Go4Gold campaign to lure women players to the sevens ranks with the 2016 Olympics in mind, and gave his daughter the nudge to follow in the family's rugby roots. ""So I went along with another netball player to try out. We turned up and were put through an Army assault course. It was horrific,"" the 25-year-old recalls. ""We were up at 5 a.m. and doing an obstacle course in -5 degrees in water. I remember at the time we were saying, 'What were we thinking, have we made the right decision?' "" The decision paid off in some style. Last season, New Zealand were crowned IRB champions and McAlister was named player of the year at the end-of-season awards. This year, the Kiwis are top of the standings going into next month's deciding tournament in Amsterdam, after beating Australia in April's China final. McAlister is New Zealand's leading try scorer this season with 20 -- one more than the netballer she tried out with, Portia Woodman, who touched down a record 12 times in Guangzhou, including the clincher in the final. That McAlister has got to such heights so soon brought a wry smile to the face of her father and brother Luke, who now plies his trade with Toulouse in France after a six-year All Blacks career in which he earned 30 Test caps. ""I was terrible when I was younger,"" she admits. ""Luke was a bit older than me so he and Dad were always out training. ""Dad would try to get me to train with them but I didn't want to. I wanted to hang out with my friends and that would have taken me away from my friends. ""So I tried to get out of it however I could, like hiding under my bed so they wouldn't find me. ""I'm gutted now as I wouldn't have had to work so hard on getting fit as a 25-year-old. I think they both laugh at me now."" Quite how she never made the move before, she admits, is a bit of a mystery considering her genetics. But then the opportunities for female rugby players had generally been limited. Luke started playing for the All Blacks while Kayla was at high school, and she was aware of both the prestige and pressure of pulling on such a famous jersey. ""I used to watch him and I've learned so much from him,"" she says. ""When I used to watch I never really followed the rules properly though. I understood the basics but I've really struggled with somethings like the rucks. ""I watch the game in a completely different way now. If I can emulate just a little of what he's achieved I'll be happy with that."" McAlister's boyfriend Pita Ahki is also a promising star, having already represented the All Blacks sevens team and this year earning a place in the Auckland Blues' Super Rugby squad. The sport has turned her life on its head. Until recently she worked for the Justice Ministry in an administrative post she had held for five years. Her rugby commitments -- training every day from 9 to 12 plus travel to tournaments -- meant that increasingly that came too hard to continue with despite her understanding and adaptable bosses. So instead she has switched back to being a student -- studying part-time in childcare, in stark contrast to the rough and tumble of her fledgling rugby career. She describes herself and women's sevens as being on a ""steep learning curve"" globally. At home, recognition is growing steadily for the sport. ""But abroad it's different,"" she says. ""The All Black jersey carries so much weight wherever you go and it's then you realize how important and how prestigious it is. ""It's great to be a part of that. Those guys are kings and obviously we're a little bit down from that but it's growing all the time. There's more rugby in high schools now and we've got schoolgirls coming into our squad now. It's exciting."" Were sevens not in the Olympics, McAlister admits this would not be a path she would be pursuing, and that she might still be plying her sporting trade in netball. ""I might go back to it one day, I don't know really but I don't miss it, I haven't had the chance,"" she says. ""Also, there's so much freedom and room to move in sevens. I love that. I'm not sure I could go back to the confines of netball where you're so constrained by your movement on the court. ""The Olympics is why you get up every morning and train. I remember watching it as a kid and loving the athletics and gymnastics in particular. To be able to be a part of that would be pretty special -- to aspire to gold would be amazing. ""But it's so competitive right now and will be even more so come 2016. Between now and then, it's all about building with the girls.""","Kayla McAlister is a new convert to sevens despite family's rugby heritage .

"(CNN) -- He has a habit of producing the goods at the season's finale, and 2014 was no different for Henrik Stenson as he successfully defended his DP World Tour Championship Sunday. Coming into the tournament in Dubai, Stenson was still searching for his maiden win of the year, having suffered near misses at both the BMW International Open and Volvo World Match Play Championship. A closing two-under-par 70 at Jumeirah Golf Estates, however, ensured that the Swede not only ended that long wait, but it also provided him with a first title defense of his career. The 38-year-old landed the European Tour's DP World Tour Championship last year to help tie up the Race to Dubai, while also securing the PGA's own season-ending Tour Championship which brought with it the FedEx Cup. But while Sunday's victory was not enough to claim the Race to Dubai for a second year running -- Rory McIlroy was confirmed as the winner earlier this month -- Stenson was still able to prove once more that he is the man to come good at the year's climax. ""It feels great. I'm exhausted to say the least,"" Stenson told the European Tour's official website. ""I had a couple of close calls this year to get my win and it was not to be. It's been close but eventually you get something if you stick around and I surely did that."" Stenson had found himself in real trouble after the 11th hole Sunday, having hit his tee shot out of bounds, enabling Spain's Rafael Cabrera-Bello to take a two-shot lead. The Swede fought back, though, and a superb tee shot on the 17th led to a tap-in birdie, allowing him to reclaim the lead. Another birdie on the 18th ensured he finished two shots clear of McIlroy, Justin Rose and Victor Dubuisson, who shared second spot. ""It was hot out there and tricky on the back nine. I did not play my best and had a shocking hole on 11,"" Stenson said. ""I walked up to the tee with too much club in my hand and instead of changing I tried to cut a two-iron but hit a push, slice, shank straight into the buildings. ""That knocked me back but I did not give up. I just had to dig in there and wait for something to happen."" Sunday's triumph is set to move Stenson up to second in the world rankings behind McIlroy, who has enjoyed a season to remember. And looking ahead to 2015, the Swede has set his sights on finally securing the elusive No. 1 berth, as well as landing a maiden major title. ""It would be nice to have been ranked the world's best at some point,"" he said. ""But if I had the choice I would go for a major championship, so I am going to try and be in good shape for them next year.""","Henrik Stenson wins DP World Tour Championship for second year running .

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy led an early morning assault by the world's best golfers on a toothless Hoylake Thursday to claim the first round lead at the British Open with Tiger Woods also making a promising start to his first major of the season. Northern Ireland's McIlroy carded six birdies in a pretty much flawless first round of six-under 66 on the Royal Liverpool seaside links, missing several other opportunities as he peppered the flags with his approach shots. Warm weather conditions and negligible winds, particularly for morning starters like McIlroy, saw a clutch of stars break 70, including Woods, who opened with a three-under-par 69. Playing on his second tournament since late March after back surgery, Woods looked rusty on the front nine as he slipped one over, but a hat-trick of birdies on the back nine saw him finish with a spring in his step. Woods won the British Open in 2006 when it was last held at Hoylake, but has been stuck on 14 major victories since 2008. McIlroy has two majors to his name, but will be hoping his habit of following up a strong opening with a poor second round will not rear its head again. In the 2010 British Open at St Andrews he led with a 63 and followed it up with an 80, while at last week's Scottish Open McIlroy backed up a 64 with a 78 to slip off the pace. ""We had perfect scoring conditions out there this morning. There wasn't much wind early on. There were plenty of opportunities to make birdies and I was able to take a few of them,"" he told the official British Open website. ""I'm looking forward to getting back out there tomorrow,"" added the 25-year-old former world number one. Matteo Manassero was another young golfer to take advantage of the calm conditions, the 21-year-old chasing McIlroy on five-under after a 67. Fellow Italians Edoardo and Francesco Molinari were among a group on four-under and Manassero is hoping the challenge will continue. ""We got off to a fast start, all of us. It's going to be wonderful to have a few Italians up there on Sunday afternoon. It's going to be fun if there is,"" he said. That group also included Americans Brooks Koepka and veteran Jim Furyk as well as Sergio Garcia of Spain. Garcia, still to win that elusive first major, acknowledged that early conditions were kind. ""Difficult to get a nicer day to play golf than today and if you manage to play well, even better!!"" he tweeted. Late on, world number one Adam Scott joined them on 68, one of the few afternoon starters to make a run at McIlroy as the wind picked up a little, with scores on average three shots higher than the morning players. 2012 winner Ernie Els was among those to struggle, missing two putts from inside a foot on the opening hole for a triple bogey seven and never recovered his composure with a seven-over 79. Defending champion Phil Mickelson, U.S. Masters champion Bubba Watson and last week's Scottish Open winner Justin Rose were also affected by the worsening conditions. Mickelson slipped to a two-over 74 after going out of bounds at the last, while Watson tripled bogeyed the 11th on the way to a wayward 76. Home hope Rose stayed in contention with a level-par 72 -- on a day 49 players broke par.","Rory McIlroy sets early pace at British Open .

"(CNN) -- Grand slam triumphs, world number one rankings, Olympic medals -- Serbia, a country of just over seven million people, has defied crushing odds and financial difficulties to emerge in recent years as an unlikely tennis powerhouse. Undeniably, the Serbian tennis rise -- dubbed ""Serb and Volley"" by some observers -- is led by Novak Djokovic. The 27-year-old, known affectionately as Nole, is currently the world's top seeded tennis player, a title he's holding for the third time in the last four years. Last July, he beat Swiss supremo Roger Federer in a thrilling Wimbledon final to win his seventh grand slam title. But it's not just Djokovic. Over the last few years, the Balkan country has produced a string of global male and female tennis superstars -- from former world number ones Ana Ivanovic and Jelena Jankovic to singles and doubles champion Nenad Zimonjic. ""I think generally we're very talented athletes, it doesn't matter which sport,"" says Zimonjic, 38. ""In the past, we didn't have that much success in individual sports but it turned out to be that our generation was maybe the beginning of something new -- you know to have world number ones, for such a small country, it was amazing."" The phenomenal rise of the sport's profile has created a halo effect in Serbia, not just for its tennis talent but the whole country. Serbia is still trying to recover from the devastation of the Balkan war in the 1990s. Since the dark days of the conflict, the country has sought to find equilibrium for an economy that was subject to years of mismanagement, suffered infrastructure damage during NATO bombings and endured extended economic sanctions. Yet, despite the limited financial backing and crumbling facilities, Serbia's tennis future still looks bright as a new generation of young athletes is determined to follow on the footsteps of their compatriot superstars. ""We are really strong people and I think that is what makes us so special,"" says 17-year-old Ivana Jorovic, a former world junior number one. ""We need to do everything alone without any help because we are really a small country. It's hard but in the other way it's really nice because that makes you really strong,"" she continues.

"(CNN) -- On her way to Haiti, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Sunday that the United States wouldn't cut aid to the economically and politically unsettled Caribbean nation -- despite major concerns about its recent and upcoming presidential elections. Clinton said she planned to keep up pressure on the Port-au-Prince government, headed by President Rene Preval, to honor recommendations from the Organization of American States related to who is on the ballot for its pivotal upcoming presidential runoff. Still, she said that any political differences would not affect U.S. support for Haiti, an already impoverished country before a devastating earthquake last year followed months later by a deadly cholera outbreak. More than 200,000 people have been sickened and 4,030 have died as of January 24, according to the latest report posted by the ministry. ""We are not talking about any of that,"" Clinton told reporters. ""We have a deep commitment to the Haitian people. And that (applies) to humanitarian aid, it goes to governance and democracy programs."" While Clinton will visit a cholera clinic, addressing Haiti's political turmoil will largely dominate her visit. Shortly after the November 28 presidential elections, Haiti's electoral council announced that former first lady Mirlande Manigat had won but lacked a majority of votes for an outright victory. Initial results put her in a runoff with Jude Celestin, a protege of the president. The third-place candidate, popular musician Michel Martelly, claimed he had won more votes than Celestin and a review of results by an Organization of American States team supported that contention. That review suggested that Martelly earned a spot in the runoff. ""The international community has been very clear, and I am going to carry that message,"" said Clinton, alluding to the U.S. support for allowing Martelly on the runoff ballot. ""But I will also be listening."" She said she'll meet with all three potential candidates -- Manigat, Celestin and Martelly -- during her trip this week to Haiti, as well as with President Rene Preval. On Sunday, Clinton acknowledged ""many complications"" and ""legitimate concerns,"" including a tight timeline. But she added that the United States was in sync with the prevailing view of diplomats from North and South America, as well as the United Nations and European Union. It's unclear whether Preval's ruling Inite (Unity) party plans to withdraw its support of Celestin in light of the election review. Discontent with Preval and his government manifested itself on the streets of Haiti after the preliminary results were announced. Haitians charged vote fraud and burned cars, tires and Celestin's campaign headquarters in Port-au-Prince. The electoral council said it will announce the final results of the first round on Wednesday. The runoff is scheduled for March 20, and final results will not be known until April 16. ""If there are ideas that we should follow up on, we will take those into account,"" Clinton said of her planned discussions with Haitian leaders and candidates. ""But we want to see the OAS recommendations followed."" CNN's Moni Basu contributed to this report .","NEW: Clinton says the U.S. won't end humanitarian relief, despite major political concerns .

"Hoylake (CNN) -- Rory McIlroy had won two majors before Sunday, but none in front of his dear old mum. No wonder then that Rosie and her 25-year-old sank into tears as he walked off the 18th green at Hoylake as the new British Open champion. A third major title of his fledgling career means the Northern Irishman is just a green jacket away from a career grand slam. But McIlroy's mum is just relieved the jinx she perceived to be preventing him from winning one in front of her evaporated in a blanket of cloud on Merseyside. ""There was high emotion on the 18th, there really was,"" McIlroy told CNN from Hoylake's clubhouse, as jubilant members in the adjacent room chanted his name. ""My mum, she hadn't been to the previous two majors that I won, and it was incredible the first person that greeted me coming off the 18th was her. ""It was really a nice moment, she was crying her eyes out and I was trying to hold back the tears -- I think a few tears definitely came out. Special moment . ""It was a very special moment and to be able to share these moments with your parents -- especially parents like I have -- they're two of my best friends. ""I can talk to them about anything. They've been there for me through thick and thin and its great to share these moments with them."" McIlroy's Open victory was markedly different to his previous two major wins. In the 2011 U.S. Open at Congressional and the following year's U.S. PGA Championship at Kiawah Island he eviscerated the field, winning both by a scarcely believable margin of eight shots. At Hoylake he had to graft. Leading by six shots prior to the final round he saw that shaved down to just two with a handful of holes left as Spain's Sergio Garcia, a friend and Ryder Cup buddy, hounded him doggedly. But his links game, tweaked and perfected on the courses of his native Northern Ireland in the weeks leading up to the tournament, remained steadfast. Despite shooting the worst score of any of the top 13 players on the final day, that cushion he'd compiled over previous days smoothed his way to glory. Top honor . So how does this one rank? ""Winning The Open, the home major for guys like myself, it's a very special championship and I'm so very honored to have won it,"" he explained. ""I think every major win is different. Congressional was maybe silencing some of the doubters or battling some of the demons I had in my own head. ""Kiawah was coming off a bit of a slump in form but still having a good year. It was almost, not expected, but I felt like in 2012 the only thing I really needed was to win a major and I did. ""Again this feels a bit more like the first one at Congressional where I maybe had to silence a few doubters about how I played links golf, how can I handle a lead, how do I play well on a Friday. ""It's been a difficult 18 months at times since the start of 2013 and obviously winning the Claret Jug makes it all worthwhile."" By landing the Claret Jug, into which McIlroy revealed some top quality red wine might go, he has three of the four major titles on offer. Masters aim . The one that continues to evade him is the U.S Masters, a tournament that evokes harrowing memories. In 2011, as a 21-year-old, McIlroy led by four shots going into the final round, and disintegrated on the back nine, eventually finishing in a tie for 15th. But he'll return to Augusta with three pillars of a slam completed, and the chance to become the first European ever to clinch one. At just 25, McIlroy has years ahead of him to secure entry into elite band of six who have won all four majors. But he's aiming to do it at the first attempt. ""I'd love to, especially going to Augusta now with three legs of the career grand slam under my belt and only having the green jacket to win,"" he said. ""I'll be going with a lot of motivation, I'll do everything I can to prepare the best way I can because it'll be a great chance for me to put that little milestone in my career to bed and go forward. PGA Champs next . ""Before that there's still the PGA Championship to play at Valhalla and I want to try to do my best there but going to Augusta next April is going to be a lot of fun."" That his Open triumph came at Hoylake, in front of passionate and enthusiastic fans from Merseyside and those who had traveled across from Ireland, was fitting. He lost in the opening round of the boys championship in 2003 but retained an affinity for these links that are tightly wedged into a small corner of the Wirral Peninsula. It is an affinity that will last a lifetime after this week. ""That boys championship was 2003 -- a lot can happen in 11 years that's for sure,"" he said. ""I really enjoyed the course then. ""When I came back here a couple of weeks ago I couldn't remember all of the course -- obviously it looked much different with the grandstands and everything. ""It's a great golf course, a very fair golf course I feel, and if you play well you are rewarded. If you don't hit it so well you can put yourself in spots that make it very difficult for yourself. ""Hoylake is a course that I obviously love now but even when I got here a couple of weeks ago it was a course I felt I could do well on."" Decline reversed . McIlroy's British Open career had been in decline before this triumph. After winning the low amateur medal in 2007, he finished third at St Andrew's in 2010. He led after the opening round and shot 80 the following day before steadying over the weekend. The following year at Royal St George's he struck an stroppy note when claiming the oldest major was too reliant on weather conditions and that he wasn't prepared to change his game ""for one week a year."" In 2012 he finished 60th and last year at Muirfield he didn't even make the cut, a moment he acknowledged as one of his lowest in recent times at his winner's press conference. But a period of practice on links courses and in links conditions back in Northern Ireland prior to landing at Liverpool have recalibrated his game in triumphant fashion. ""I think you need experiences like the one in 2010, having the first round lead and losing it,"" he said. Lesson learned . ""OK, I came back and finished third but you need experiences like that to move forward and to learn from. ""I definitely learned a lot from that day in 2010 just as I learned a lot from my day at Augusta in 2011, having a four-shot lead going into the final day and ultimately losing out, having a very bad back nine. ""Did I feel like I could do it this year? I did. I felt like my game was in good shape. I had the win earlier in the year at Wentworth and I felt like my game was just coming into form.

"(CNN) -- It was a dark, windy and rainy night when Per Johansson returned from work to his home in Saro just south of Gothenburg, Sweden. ""It was raining really bad. In the wind I heard something screaming with a very dark voice,"" Johansson told CNN. ""At first I wondered if it was the crazy neighbors, but then I heard it again and went and checked. I saw something really big up in a tree in my neighbors' yard and it was a moose. It must have been drunk after eating fermented apples and as it was reaching out for more fruit it must have slipped and fallen into the tree."" Johansson called the local fire and rescue department, which responded with a fire engine and a jeep with a winch. ""We got the alarm at 9.59 p.m. on September 6 that a moose was stuck in a tree,"" said Anders Gardhagen, spokesman at the Gothenburg Fire and Rescue Services. ""When we arrived we used the winch to bend down the apple tree so the moose could get himself out of the tree. Once free, the moose collapsed on the ground and fell asleep. So we let him sleep it off and went back home"" Gardhagen told CNN. ""Moose are attracted by the apple trees, and in the autumn when the apples have fallen off the trees we normally have at least one of these cases of intoxication. These apples, which ferment in their bellies, aren't part of their natural food, so they can get quite angry from this drunkenness,"" Gardhagen said. Johansson's son, Gustav, who is about to turn 11, made sure to take lots of pictures of the ordeal. ""He is saving up to buy a PlayStation so he thought he would take pictures that he could sell,"" Johansson said. CNN purchased three of Gustav's pictures. When dawn came the day after it was freed from the tree, the moose had not yet left. ""When I went out for the newspaper it was still laying there on the ground, sleeping. By the time I left for work it was walking around the neighbor's yard on very shaky legs."" Johansson said. ""Today the moose came back and walked around the yard,"" he added.

"(CNN) -- Sporting a head bandage after a painful earlier clash it just had to be Martin Skrtel to perform injury time heroics to salvage a vital 2-2 draw for Liverpool against Arsenal Sunday. Slovakian international defender Skrtel bravely powered a bullet header from an Adam Lallana corner into the visiting net with his team down to 10 men. Referee Michael Oliver had added nine minutes of extra time -- ironically most of it as a result of the injury suffered by Skrtel after being accidentally caught by the studs of Olivier Giroud. Looking a little dazed, he looked set to be substituted but instead was patched up with the bandage and carried on. But trailing to goals by Mathieu Debuchy and Giroud, Liverpool looked set for another damaging defeat, their cause not helped by the red card needlessly gained by substitute Fabio Borini at the start of the extended added time. Then up stepped Skrtel to power the equalizer, but there was still time for Santi Cazorla to almost put Arsenal ahead again, his effort pushed away by Brad Jones. The result lifts Liverpool to 10th, while Arsenal moves up to sixth, four points outside of the top four. Skrtel shrugged off his injury when questioned after the match. ""It was painful at the time, but I think it is all right now. Injuries are all part of football,"" he told Sky Sports. ""It was a great cross from Adam Lallana. I had missed a header a bit before and I have been waiting for a goal for a long time,"" he added. Liverpool, who reached the semifinals of the English League Cup in midweek, was the dominant side in the first half and went ahead through a fine strike from Philippe Coutinho. But the lead was short lived and Debuchy leveled with a header just before half time. Arsenal went ahead just after the hour mark when Giroud connected with a Cazorla cross and Arsene Wenger's men looked set to revenge a 5-1 defeat in the corresponding fixture last season. That came in the middle of Liverpool's superb run which saw the team narrowly fail to win the EPL title. With Luis Suarez leaving for Barcelona, this season has been a struggle, increasing the pressure on manager Brendan Rodgers, but Skrtel's late brave intervention could prove a turning point. Earlier, Sunderland beat Newcastle 1-0 in the Tyne-Wear derby, with Adam Johnson scoring a 90th minute winner for the visitors. It was the fourth straight win in the fiercely contested derby for the Black Cats, easing them away from the relegation zone. In France's Ligue 1, Marseille tops the table ahead of the Christmas break after a 2-1 win over Lille Sunday. Belgian striker Michy Batshuayi secured a ninth straight home win for Marseille with the winner. It last won the French title in 2010 but under coach Marcelo Bielsa leads champions PSG by three points.","10-man Liverpool salvages late 2-2 draw with Arsenal .

"(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho's Chelsea had the last laugh on London rival West Ham to keep up its relentless pace at the top of the English Premier League with a 2-0 Boxing Day home win. The pre-match build up had centered on Mourinho's remarks after the corresponding fixture last season -- when peeved by the West Ham defensive tactics in a 0-0 draw -- he said manager Sam Allardyce and the team had been playing ""football from the 19th century"" -- amid other sharp criticism. Mourinho backtracked on these remarks and has paid compliment to West Ham's fine form in the current campaign, in fourth place ahead of the latest round of games, but it did not prevent the Hammers' official Twitter feed from posting a witty rejoinder before the match. It featured a tweet with a sepia-colored picture of a horse and cart, accompanied by the caption: ""The West Ham United team coach (and horse) has arrived at @chelseafc for today's game #19thcenturyfootball"". In truth, once the match got underway there was little the visitors could do to stem the tide of almost constant Chelsea attacks, with very little in reply. Eden Hazard, recovered from the knock he received in the 2-0 win over Stoke Monday, was a strong influence again for the Blues, who went ahead when John Terry reacted quickly to a Diego Costa header from a Cesc Fabregas's corner. It was the former England international's second goal in two games and his team might have been further ahead but for Adrian producing a fine save from Nemanja Matic and top scorer Costa shooting over. Hazard was nearly on the score sheet early in the second half, but it was the Belgian international who turned provider as he played Costa through to finish clinically for this 13th of the season just after the hour mark. Further goals might have followed with the table toppers in confident mood, although West Ham came close to cutting the deficit when substitute Morgan Amalfitano hit the post with a shot. ""We played a very good game against a very difficult opponent. When we scored, we had the game always under control,"" Mourinho told Sky Sports. ""I am really happy. We are doing very well."" Later, defending champions Manchester City kept the gap on Chelsea to three points with a fine 3-1 win at West Bromwich Albion, while third-placed Manchester United eased past Newcastle 3-1, with Wayne Rooney scoring twice. Southampton won 3-1 at Crystal Palace to leapfrog West Ham into fourth spot, the defeat the last match in charge for home boss Neil Warnock.

"House GOP leaders announced their intention Wednesday to pass a bill this week that would only keep the government running after September 30 if President Barack Obama's health care reform law is fully defunded. The decision sets up a high stakes game of political chicken over the next 12 days, as Democrats have repeatedly rejected any attempt to undo the president's signature legislative achievement. ""We're going to continue to do everything we can to repeal the president's failed health care law,"" said House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.  ""The law is a train wreck."" ""We aim to put a stop to Obamacare before it costs one more job or raises a family's out-of-pocket expenses one more dollar,"" said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia. The House bill, which would keep the government running through mid-December, also locks in overall funding levels at $986 billion, preserving Washington's so-called ""sequester"" -- forced across-the-board spending cuts that have been criticized by leaders on both sides of the aisle. Obamacare, spending showdown heats up in House . Most congressional Democrats, opposed to further cuts in non-defense spending, have expressed their strong opposition to such a move. In addition, the GOP bill states that Social Security and disability payments need to receive top priority if Congress and the president are unable to raise the federal debt ceiling by mid-October. A failure to extend the nation's borrowing limit and pay bills already incurred risks an unprecedented national default. Obama and other Democratic leaders have warned they will not cave to GOP demands for new spending cuts in exchange for a hike in the debt limit. ""I'm happy to negotiate with (congressional Republicans) around the budget, just as I've done in the past,"" Obama told business leaders on Wednesday. ""What I will not do is create a habit, a pattern, whereby the full faith and credit of the United States ends up being a bargaining chip to set policy. It's irresponsible."" The president told his audience to ""flip the script for a second and imagine a situation in which a Democratic speaker said to a Republican president, 'I'm not going to increase the debt ceiling unless you increase corporate taxes by 20 percent.  And if you don't do it, we'll default on the debt and cause a worldwide financial crisis.'"" ""That can't be a recipe for government,"" he said. A less confrontational strategy initially backed by GOP leaders unraveled last week. Government shutdown: Again? Seriously? Numerous House Republicans threatened to defeat a temporary spending measure proposed by their leadership because it did not directly link continued government funding with a ban on money for the new health care law. Conservative groups such as Tea Party Patriots and Heritage Action for America praised the harder line now adopted by Boehner and other GOP leaders. ""Senate Democrats and President Obama must make a decision: shut down the government to protect a destructive, unpopular law or acknowledge Obamacare has failed and cannot be salvaged,"" said Michael Needham, communications director for Heritage Action. One Republican, Nebraska Rep. Lee Terry, told CNN that conservative activists had been strongly engaged with House members on the issue in recent weeks. I ""absolutely heard from a lot of our conservative groups over the (summer) break about defunding Obamacare,"" Terry said.  ""The pressure was absolutely there ... (though) I didn't feel like it was pressure per se because I agreed we need to do away with Obamacare."" Opinion: Worried about Obamacare? Fear not . Another Republican, freshman Rep. Trey Radel of Florida, predicted the White House will eventually give in to at least some GOP demands. ""I think the president will negotiate with us,"" he said. Other Republicans seemed less sure. ""We can't let the government shut down,"" said Rep. Peter King, R-New York.  ""We can't be kamikazes and we can't be General Custer."" A top Senate Democrat warned House Republicans they were playing a losing hand. ""Republican leaders in the House have decided to give the hard right their day in the sun, and decided to pursue an agenda that they know will never, ever be signed into law,"" New York's Chuck Schumer said. ""Reasonable Republicans, stop these zealots in your party from driving our economy off a cliff."" Meanwhile, with a potential government shutdown less than two weeks away, the White House budget office directed federal agencies on Wednesday to prepare for a potential shutdown. Sylvia Burwell, director of the Office of Management and Budget, told federal agencies to update their plans in the event no agreement is reached before September 30, the end of the fiscal year. ""Prudent management requires that agencies be prepared for the possibility of a lapse,"" Burwell wrote.","House GOP pushes bill tying government funding to end of Obamacare funding .

"(CNN)Sunday's action in football's Premier League failed to match the Boxing Day goal-fest but that didn't mean there was a shortage of drama. Most of it took place in Manchester, with surging defending champion Manchester City coming unstuck against relegation threatened Burnley. Cruising with a 2-0 lead after 35 minutes, City relinquished two goals in the second half to only settle for a point. Out went its nine-match winning streak. The second-half lapse meant City failed to close the gap to one point on leader Chelsea, which had earlier drawn 10-man Southampton 1-1. The margin remains three points. Manuel Pellegrini's men -- despite missing strikers Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko -- netted six goals in their last two matches and when the in-form David Silva and holding midfielder Fernandinho found the back of the net within 33 minutes, it appeared as if a landslide win was on the cards. But City relaxed and plucky Burnley -- which has improved in the past two months -- pounced. George Boyd began the comeback in the 47th minute before Ashley Barnes leveled past Joe Hart in the 81st. ""It was a big opportunity to get two more points,"" Pellegrini was quoted as saying by the BBC. ""Everybody would think the game was over but I always say it is never over until the last minute. ""The pitch was very heavy, two games in 48 hours, but we were winning 2-0. Once it was 2-2 we didn't have the legs to score. We only had two shots after that. ""We didn't play well in the second half."" Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho was left bewildered with the officiating at Southampton, feeling his team should have been awarded a penalty when Cesc Fabregas hit the ground under a challenge from Matt Targett early in the second half with the score tied 1-1. No penalty was given and Fabregas was booked by Anthony Taylor. In recent weeks, allegations of diving have centered around Chelsea players Gary Cahill, Diego Costa, Willian and Branislav Ivanovic. ""I can't believe that the referee didn't give a penalty,"" Mourinho told Sky. ""I can believe that Southampton defended with everything they have -- good organization, good spirit, good solidarity between the players. ""I can also understand the game that my players played. They tried to win, especially in the second half, when we had complete control. I cannot understand such a big penalty (decision). Or I understand (it could be) a consequence of something that looks like a campaign. ""Out of nothing, (West Ham manager) Sam Allardyce starts speaking about Chelsea players diving, and in another game it is another coach."" Chelsea bossed possession with 60% of the ball but managed one shot on target, Eden Hazard's clinical finish in first-half injury time. Morgan Schneiderlin was sent off for the fourth-place Saints in the 88th minute, tripping Fabregas for a second yellow. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal was not happy, either, unimpressed with teams having to play two games in three days. Such, however, is life over the festive period in England. After United and Tottenham played to a 0-0 draw in London, he described the football as ugly. ""The second half was a struggle,"" the Dutchman told BT Sport. ""You can see the players can't recover in two days. It was an ugly match."" But United would have scored two or three goals in the first half if not for the heroics of Tottenham keeper Hugo Lloris. Elsewhere, Arsenal rose into a tie on points with Southampton after beating West Ham 2-1 on the road; Stoke heaped more pressure on Alan Irvine by topping West Bromwich Albion 2-0; and draw specialist Sunderland couldn't register a winner against Aston Villa even though it played most of the second half with an extra man. Their match concluded 0-0. Hull must have thought its troubles were over when it beat Sunderland two days ago, but Steve Bruce's Tigers fell at home 1-0 to last-place Leicester -- which had lost six straight. Crystal Palace, which sacked Neil Warnock on Saturday, claimed a point after holding QPR to a 0-0 result. QPR -- owned by Air Asia's Tony Fernandes -- held a 5-2-2 record at home while losing all nine of its road games. In the late kickoff, roller-coaster Newcastle beat Everton 3-2 at home to hand the Toffees a sixth loss in their last eight. Struggling Liverpool hosts Swansea on Monday. No more EPL for Torres . Mourinho and Chelsea will no longer be calling upon Fernando Torres. Chelsea announced late Saturday that the Spanish striker -- an $80 million flop for the Blues -- would be moving to AC Milan permanently following his loan move to the Italian giant. Torres scored only 20 goals in 110 league appearances for Chelsea in three years, although he won the Champions League during that time. It followed a prolific spell in front of goal with Liverpool. ""Chelsea Football Club thanks Fernando for his service during the past four seasons and wishes him the very best for the future,"" a Chelsea statement said. Torres, according to reports, could be headed back to Atletico Madrid in another loan move. The World Cup winner first made a name for himself at the Spanish club.","Manchester City blows two-goal lead at home and draws lowly Burnley 2-2 .

"To get a sense of just how polarizing a figure new media innovator Andrew Breitbart was, get a load of this tweet from Slate's Matt Yglesias that went out mere hours after the news of Breitbart's unexpected death at age 43 broke: ""The world outlook is slightly improved with @AndrewBrietbart dead."" Breitbart would relish that sort of venomous barb, not least because it meant that liberals with an uncomplicated mainstream media perspective were taking notice of him and his point of view. That such a churlish and distasteful comment reflects poorly on its author, an establishment blogger with impeccable left of center bona fides, and his Washington Post-owned platform, would simply be icing on the cake. As the creator of the controversial suite of ""Big"" sites (including Big Government, Big Journalism, Big Hollywood, and Big Peace), the man who helped put the nonprofit ACORN in the crosshairs of angry lawmakers who ultimately defunded the organization, and the reason former New York Rep. Anthony Weiner's crotch shot went viral, Breitbart didn't simply risk the ire of indignant liberals. He insisted on it, even as he was no straight-up social conservative: At the 2011 Conservative Political Action Conference, he protested the banning of the gay-friendly group GOProud by hosting a dance party featuring lesbian singer Sophie B. Hawkins. (Full disclosure: I have blogged in the past for Big Hollywood and Reason.tv posts some of our videos at Big Government.) Anyone who tries to reduce his importance to that of a fire-breathing, ax-wielding right-wing hatchet man -- a sort of Sean Hannity Jr. - is going to miss entirely his enduring legacy to the current and future mediascape. For years, his job was to be ""Matt Drudge's bitch"" (his term, which he used in a 2007 Reason interview), to prowl the Web for links both banal and profound and edit the site that more than any other showed how the Internet could be used to route around information bottlenecks imposed by official spokesmen and legacy news outlets. From Drudge, he went on to help launch the Huffington Post of all things, named for the foreign-born, heavily accented woman who once campaigned for California's ugly, anti-immigrant Proposition 187 before embracing the gospel according to Howard Zinn, Van Jones, and Bill Maher. Widely misunderstood in its embryonic phase as the worst sort of vanity project -- Arianna Huffington's celebrity friends lecture the world about livable wages while dropping green-energy manifestos from their private jets -- the Huffington Post is in fact a marvel of open-sourced news gathering and content creation. Though Huffington would later challenge some of Breitbart's claims about how much of her site sprung fully formed from his brow, she never stinted on the fact that he was intensely interested in creating a new way of conversing about everything that matters to people: ""He was extremely interested in how to have a conversation online — how to bring together all these interesting voices,"" Huffington told Wired's Noah Shachtman. ""Now it's, like, so obvious. But at the time, it had never been done."" He pulled off the same stunt with his increasingly influential ""Big"" sites -- and in a way that was more suited to his ideological leanings, which tilted not so much toward the right as they did against what he saw as inescapable and underappreciated bias and smugness in the mainstream media. As my colleague Matt Welch, a longtime friend of Breitbart, writes, ""He didn't actually have strong philosophical/policy beliefs -- at all -- and he was always perfectly comfortable and perfectly welcome in ideologically and culturally diverse settings."" From the dozen or so occasions in which I interacted with him, I can attest to the truth of that statement. He had opinions as big as all outdoors and loved to argue about everything -- and on nothing more than the innate superiority of the National League to the American League in baseball (on this, as on many other topics, he was surely wrong). But the point is that he loved to argue, not to surround himself with people who thought exactly like him. His legacy has nothing to do with whether the Republican party picked up Anthony Weiner's congressional seat or whether ACORN has been able to renew its funding. It has to do with the ways in which he created new places and spaces to talk about whatever any of us want to talk about. He told Reason in 2004 that after feeling ignored by existing outlets, ""We decided to go out and create our media."" It doesn't matter who we is, kemo sabe. It's the conservatives at Drudge, the liberals at HuffPo, the leftists at DailyKos, the libertarians at Reason. It's all of us and Breitbart helped create and grow a series of do-it-yourself demonstration projects through which we can all speak more loudly and more fully. Breitbart is dead, but the conversation pits he built will live on for a long, long time. A lot of people theorize about democratizing the public square and bringing new voices and sources into conversations about politics and culture. Breitbart actually did it. It wasn't always perfect and it wasn't always pretty (ask Shirley Sherrod, the former Department of Agriculture official who sued him for defamation), but he blazed a path that surely leads to a far richer and more interesting mediascape than the one we all grew up with.","Nick Gillespie says Andrew Brietbart, who died, was polarizing -- and liked it .
He says Brietbart baited liberals but was not straight-up conservative .
He says his legacy was creating discussion outlets away from what he saw as smug media .

"Undocumented immigrant students in California will be able to receive state-funded financial aid in 2013 to attend college, under a new law signed Saturday by Gov. Jerry Brown. The law allows top students who are on a path to citizenship to apply and receive the state aid, the governor said. About 2,500 students are projected to receive Cal Grants totaling $14.5 million, according to the California Department of Finance. That averages out to $5,800 per student. The funding amounts to 1% of the overall $1.4 billion Cal Grant program, officials said. The new law, AB 131, is one of two pieces of legislation known as the California Dream Act and will become effective January 1, 2013, officials said. ""Going to college is a dream that promises intellectual excitement and creative thinking,"" Brown said in a statement from Sacramento. ""The Dream Act benefits us all by giving top students a chance to improve their lives and the lives of all of us."" Currently, illegal immigrant students in California must pay resident tuition rates if they graduated from a state high school and are actively seeking to legalize their immigration status, officials said. The other half of the California Dream Act was signed into law by Brown in July and allows undocumented immigrant students to receive privately funded scholarships administered at public universities and community colleges. That law, called AB 130, was needed because the University of California and California State University systems avoided giving the private scholarships to their undocumented students, citing vagueness in laws, said the legislative aide to California Dream Act's author, state Assemblyman Gilbert Cedillo (D-Los Angeles). Cedillo called Saturday's signing ""historic"" and path-breaking for the United States -- coming at a time when many states such as Alabama and Arizona are passing aggressive laws targeting undocumented immigrants. Some of those laws are being challenged in court. ""The signing of now both parts of the California Dream Act will send a message across the country that California is prepared to lead the country with a positive and productive vision for how we approach challenging issues related to immigration,"" Cedillo said in a statement. ""Today, Ana and Maria Gomez, Jaime Kim, David Cho, Pedro Ramirez -- and thousands of other students who are some of the best and brightest in California -- have been told by our governor and legislative leaders that you are welcome here, that you have something to contribute, that you can be proud of what you have accomplished and that your talents and ambition will not go to waste,"" Cedillo said. Under AB 131, undocumented immigrant students will be eligible for state Board of Governors fee waivers, student aid programs administered by a college or university, and the state aid Cal Grants program for state universities, community colleges, and qualifying independent and career colleges or technical schools in California, according to Cedillo. The California Dream Act differs from a proposed federal bill called the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors -- or DREAM -- Act, which would create a path to citizenship for immigrants who entered the United States illegally as children under the age of 16 and have lived in the United States for at least five years, obtained a high school or General Education Development diploma, and demonstrated ""good moral character,"" according to a White House fact sheet.","The funding amounts to 1% of the overall $1.4 billion Cal Grant program, officials said .
The students will be at the top of their class and on a path to citizenship .
The new law, effective in 2013, is half of the California Dream Act .
The other half was approved in July, allowing private scholarships for similar students ."
"Kudos to the rabble rousers in the Class of 2014 making waves across the country protesting the political views of commencement speakers.  Your intentions are entirely in the right place, but you're going about it all wrong. It's understandable to want to protest the views and actions of Condoleezza Rice, a leading war monger in the Bush administration who backed policies that led to so many needless American and Iraqi deaths. There's a valid critique of how the International Monetary Fund and its leader, Christine Lagarde, actually harm poor nations with the economic conditions IMF loans impose. And the University of California at Berkeley was arguably extremely violent in its handling of Occupy protesters under the leadership of Chancellor Robert Birgeneau. All three leaders have canceled planned commencement addresses after protests by students at Rutgers University, Smith College and Haverford College respectively. Which doesn't accomplish very much, I'm afraid.  The media story -- and thus the public discussion generally -- is now about free speech and the marketplace of ideas and whether today's college students are so intolerant of different viewpoints that they try and banish them altogether. We're discussing whether the Class of 2014 is too entitled when we should be talking about the failures of foreign policy in the Bush administration and appropriate police powers in a post-9/11 security state. Is the Class of 2014 too entitled?  Not necessarily.  But you might not be good organizers. So to those of you who haven't raised objections to commencement speakers yet, or who are getting a jump on 2015, here's some advice:  Let them come. The most objectionable speaker you can imagine with a public policy reputation you find utterly detestable?  Roll out the red mortar board and gown.  Allow them to come.  Nay, lure them.  And then protest. Then the story will be about your message, not just your miff.  And in the age of social media, that message will spread.  Everyone's already futzing with their smartphones under their gowns anyway. How can you stage an effective protest at your graduation?  Here are a few ideas. Spell out a message: Use masking tape to put a letter on each mortar cap, be sure to sit in the right order with your compatriots and at the right moment, send your message without saying a single word. Alternatively, you can achieve a similar effect by writing each letter on a manila file folder, folding each up and hiding it under your gown until the right moment.  A great thing about this tactic is it forces you to get your critique down to its essence, which makes your message clear and easily shared by others. In a variation on this, students at Columbia University are planning a graduation protest placing pieces of red tape on their mortar boards to voice displeasure with the university failing to take certain steps to prevent sexual assault on campus. Stand up and turn around: Sometimes the most powerful speech comes in the form of silence.  At the start of the commencement address, stand up and turn around.  Ideally make sure you're not the only one -- that there are 20 or 200 people scattered throughout the graduating class who will start popping up one by one and stand silently, back to the speaker, in quiet but powerful protest.  Especially if a large number of students oppose the speaker, this is a great way to put that on display. On the other hand, this doesn't work well with a small handful of protesters. Students at the University of Michigan organized such a protest in 2011 when Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder was their commencement speaker.  Snyder had proposed more than $200 million in higher education budget cuts.  Unfortunately, though, out of 5,500 graduates, only a few dozen stood in protest. Organize a picket: Sure it's old-fashioned, but it works: A few dozen students and allies with picket signs voicing their disapproval with the chosen commencement speaker.  It helps if you have fliers to hand out to the audience attending the commencement, so you can at least inform them of why you're protesting even if they're not going to join you. In 2012, when George Washington University (my alma mater) gave an honorary degree to Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, a group of students protested Slim's business practices, which they argue have trampled on poor people and developing nations. The protest was small, but large enough to get covered by The Washington Post. Get creative: I'm not going to encourage anything illegal or even questionably immoral, but I will say that from streaking to well-timed releases of doves, there are plenty of ways to get attention for your protest.  You're college students.  You're a creative, think-outside-the-box bunch.  Get some balloons and duct tape and tarantulas and do something inventive and attention getting. Effective protests aren't about anger. They're about spectacle. Make a spectacle. Bonus: Even the well-known folks often give boring commencement speeches, so if you can make your protest entertaining, your fellow students will be even more grateful. Booing and heckling are so 2004:  And they're rude.  I don't mean to sound condescending or anything, but one of the things you learn as you grow up in your political activist life is that cathartic isn't a synonym for strategic. In fact, they're often diametrically opposed.  You might feel damn proud of yourself as you're being hauled off by campus security after screaming at some neoconservative commencement speaker but at least a third of the audience thinks you're an obnoxious jerk.  And a third don't know why you were protesting and/or forgot that you even protested a second after it happened. The third who support you?  They'll support you no matter what, so try a different tactic and see if you can broaden your support and engage and inform a wider swath of the audience.  Activism isn't about self-expression.  It's about changing hearts and minds and engaging more and more people in the fight for change. But you can't change those hearts and minds and get more people engaged if you aren't even heard in the first place. Invite those different opinions onto your campus, instead of dismissing them.  We need to engage more with ideas we disagree with, that's what sharpens our own views and ideas.  And if you do disagree, if you want to protest and do so visibly, make it count.","Sally Kohn: Students protesting views of commencement speakers are well-intentioned .

Kohn: Don't stop speakers from coming to campus, but protest if you object to their views .

"(CNN) -- The president of world soccer's governing body is used to being admonished. But it isn't often the manager of arguably the biggest club on the planet is tearing a strip off Sepp Blatter. Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti felt moved to tell Blatter to button it after the Swiss insisted Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer should be crowned footballer of the year. That affronted Ancelotti, who thinks his star player -- Cristiano Ronaldo -- is a shoo-in for a second successive Ballon d'Or award. The Portuguese fired a record 17 goals in the European Champions League last season as Real won its 10th crown and Ancelotti is in no doubt the award should be his. ""It has surprised me what the FIFA president has said and it appears he is unable to keep his mouth shut,"" Ancelotti told a press conference on Tuesday. ""The Ballon d'Or is something that gets talked about months before yet this year there are not that many things to think about. ""Last year Cristiano had other players like Lionel Messi and Franck Ribery contesting it but this year, with the titles he has won and the goals he has scored, there's no doubt he is going to win it. ""Therefore, Blatter's words don't make any sense."" On a visit to 2018 World Cup host Russia, Blatter suggested Neuer should be handed the gong after a string of exceptional performances for Germany on its way to a World Cup triumph in Brazil. FIFA's president had also suggested the Bayern Munich stopper should have been handed the Golden Ball award -- given to the World Cup's best player -- rather than Barcelona striker Lionel Messi. Messi, a four-time winner of the Ballon d'Or is again on the list, with other luminaries, but, perhaps surprisingly, not Barcelona's newest striker, Luis Suarez. Suarez scored 31 goals for English Premier League club Liverpool last season as it came agonizingly close to a first top flight title since 1990. The Uruguayan also starred for his country at the 2014 World Cup, before he was banned from all football for four months for biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini. The award is voted for by coaches and captains of national teams and journalists across the world selected by France Football Magazine, and will be awarded in Zurich, Switzerland, on January 12. Ancelotti, who also claimed the Spanish Cup in his first season at the helm in Madrid, has been nominated for the Best Coach prize. And though he joked he might be out of the running to win it after his harsh words for Blatter, Ancelotti did say he was pleased to have been selected. ""I am proud to be in this category and would like to win it, although I have already received the biggest prize when we claimed the Champions League,"" he said. ""If I win another one I'll have to expand my trophy cabinet.""","Real Madrid manager says FIFA president Sepp Blatter ""unable to keep mouth shut""

"(CNN) -- The first step is always the hardest -- but the second is just as challenging. Once the dust has settled, the well wishers have moved on and the interviews have ceased, there's the realization that there is a world out there -- waiting to be confronted. ""For 25 years, you've lived a certain way and with distance,"" U.S. footballer Robbie Rogers, who now plays for Los Angeles Galaxy, said in an interview for CNN's ""World Sport Presents: Journey of a Gay Athlete"" documentary. ""You're afraid to tell people and be open with stuff and so it's hard to just change. A lot of gay men and women who aren't out and don't really accept that they're gay, live with a bit of self-hate. ""So I hate to be so blunt about it, but hating yourself is very damaging."" Rogers' escapism came through writing -- notably his blog, on which he announced his revelation -- and therapy. ""To live for 25 years or for some people, 40 or 50 years, that doesn't go away quickly,"" said Rogers, who has also written a book ""Coming Out to Play,"" which is released later this year. ""It takes a long time. It takes a lot of writing and a lot of friends to speak with and therapy. ""It's serious stuff and sometimes people forget. They'll say 'Oh, you're out, everything's probably great. You seem so happy. ""It's like, 'Well, you knew me before I came out and you thought I was happy, so you don't know.' ""It takes time but it's definitely progress, and positive progress."" Rogers was 25 when he broke the news that he was gay on his blog, having just left English second division club Leeds. It's a piece of writing which still brings out fierce emotion in man who had decided that he would longer be able to reconcile his love of football with a yearning to be free. He promptly retired from football -- only to return in May after being offered a deal to play in the U.S. with LA Galaxy. Having played football throughout his childhood and then at college, he nevertheless struggled emotionally in the fiercely masculine arena where words like ""homo,"" ""fag"" or ""gay"" were commonplace. ""I always heard homophobic things in locker rooms, on soccer fields, you know, before training, after training,"" said Rogers, who was more or less convinced he was gay by the age of 13 or 14. ""Whether it was joking or whether it was malicious, I just heard so many different things that scarred me and made me think that there's no chance I'm ever going to come out -- ever -- to anyone. ""So that's probably why, again, I kept it in for so long. That's why I didn't tell anyone until I was 25."" Since he came out in February, Rogers has spent time speaking with college students and fellow members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community. His message, wherever he goes and whoever he speaks to, is simple. Talk to somebody. ""I regret it,"" Rogers said after contemplating whether he should have sought advice on his quandary earlier. ""I wish at a young age I'd have spoken with someone -- someone who didn't know my family or wasn't a friend or anything. ""I wanted a mentor or a therapist, somebody I could speak to and share my thoughts with, because to live so long without telling anyone is just very harmful. ""People ask me, 'Well, what would you tell yourself as a young kid?' ""Well, I wouldn't change any of my experiences, because I am who I am and because of all of those things, and because of my struggles, . ""I wouldn't change that. But, to speak with someone would have been, that would have changed a lot for me."" Rogers grew up as part of a devout Catholic family in California. He felt the pressure of his religion and allied to the prying eyes of his testosterone fueled soccer teammates, he kept himself to himself. ""The biggest obstacle is fear. The fear of rejection from their teammates, from fans, probably their families, fear of the owners of the team might not want a gay athlete. ""I think people want to support themselves and they support themselves with their sport, so they if they lose their sport then how are they supposed to take care of themselves and all the other people they take care of? ""So, I mean fear is the number one factor. It's just people... there's just so many things that play into that."" Thomas Hitzlsperger, who won 52 caps for Germany and played in England, Italy and Germany, is the most high-profile former player to announce he is gay. Like Rogers, the former Germany international struggled with the concept of coming out while playing professional football. ""There is a difference between silence and lying,"" said Hitzlsperger. ""I've never been ashamed of being gay... but I have asked myself the typical questions that gay people ask themselves: What would my friends say? How will my family react? But I've never been ashamed."" Rogers is now one of the most recognizable faces in the fight against homophobia. Where in the past he would deliver crosses for a striker, now he delivers speeches on equality. Where before he may have penned the odd autograph, he now signs thousands and writes articles for highbrow publications on Russia's homosexuality laws. He has received letters from those who are contemplating suicide, living a life of solitude, gripped by a fear which they cannot seem to shake off. If Rogers is all too aware of that fear, he has been buoyed by the sight of a younger generation who are embracing their sexuality. ""I went to an event in Portland to speak with a bunch of kids at Nike and I saw about 500 kids,"" he recalled. ""They shared their story and I just talked about mine and answered questions. And, they were asking questions like, 'Alright, we're going to go home tomorrow, what should we do?' ""These are all the kids that are LGBT leaders of their groups in high school and I was like, 'Oh, gosh, these kids are so brave. They're all out in high school, some of them are freshmen and they're just trying to change the world and just trying to be happy.' ""It made me really mad at the people that couldn't understand that and accept them, but also mad at myself where, 'OK, I have this proper platform where I can really try to help people with it. ""Kind of a global platform, and any of these kids would die or that, to have a platform in any way.'"" Hiztlsperger is also keen to promote the issue of gay rights -- particularly ahead of the 2014 Winter Olympics at Sochi, Russia. Russian law bars the public discussion of gay rights and relationships anywhere children might hear it -- and has been condemned by rights groups both at home and abroad as discriminatory. ""I'm coming out about my homosexuality because I want to move the discussion about homosexuality among professional sportspeople forwards,"" Hiztlsperger told German newspaper, Die Ziet. It is hoped that the Games in Sochi, where protestors have been afforded designated areas to air their views, will help fight the prejudice which is still so prevalent within sport and society. ""I just hope that people will just forget any of those labels and stereotypes that are slapped on different people,"" said Rogers. ""Whether it's race, sex or sexual orientation, I just want that to go away. ""I know that probably won't happen in the near future, but hopefully in the near future, if athletes decide they want to come out, they're not pressured anymore. ""It took me so long, I don't want to be a hypocrite that way, but it would be nice if some could come out and start to move things forward. ""And, until there's same-sex marriage in every state, we're still going to have to talk about that. ""There are lots of issues which people get annoyed by because it doesn't affect them, but we're going to continue to talk about it until it's over with.""","Footballer Robbie Rogers is one of the most high-profile voices in battle for gay rights .

"(CNN)Country music star Little Jimmy Dickens, a fixture at the Grand Ole Opry for decades, died Friday of cardiac arrest after having a stroke on Christmas, the website for the famed music venue reported. Dickens, 94, died at a hospital in Nashville, according to media reports. ""It is with a heavy heart that I say goodbye to my hero and friend today. I loved you Jimmy,"" Brad Paisley wrote on Twitter. Dickens joined the Opry, the showcase for country music, in 1948. ""The Grand Ole Opry did not have a better friend than Little Jimmy Dickens,"" Opry Vice President and General Manager Pete Fisher said in a statement.  ""He loved the audience and his Opry family, and all of us loved him back. He was a one-of-kind entertainer and a great soul whose spirit will live on for years to come."" Dickens -- known for his diminutive stature, colorful rhinestone-studded jackets and keen sense of humor -- had several novelty hits, beginning in 1949. ""May The Bird Of Paradise Fly Up Your Nose,"" ""Out Behind the Barn,"" and ""Take An Old Cold Tater (And Wait)"" are among his fans' favorite tunes. Another is ""I'm Little, But I'm Loud."" The 4-foot-11-inch artist was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1983.  He is survived by his wife, Mona Dickens, and two daughters. ""I am deeply saddened. We have lost  a precious treasure,"" tweeted Charlie Daniels. The Opry's news release said plans were still being formed for a funeral, as well as a public viewing and service. Dickens was born in Bolt, West Virginia, the oldest of 13 children. In 2007 he told West Virginia Public Broadcasting that while his dad was a coal miner and the family was poor, they were never hungry. ""Nothing easy about coal mining for a living but we all got by,"" he said. ""There was more love in our family than the money."" He said his grandparents raised him. His mother and uncles played guitars and banjos but none of them played professionally, he said. He got his start on a radio station in Beckley, according to a biography on the Hall of Fame website. He had a $12 guitar that he carried in a pillowcase and he got to sing a song or two each week. Eventually he'd go out and sing with the stars of the station, he said. He was still in high school at the time. He moved on to a station in Cincinnati, where he was doing a morning show when country star Roy Acuff came for a visit in the 1940s. Acuff invited Dickens to sing a song in his show, which the star liked enough to help get Dickens an invitation to sing at the Opry even before he had a record. ""I went down there and did that and it worked for me,"" Dickens said. He said he wanted to be remembered for his honesty with his fans and coworkers and for his desire to always get better as a performer.

"(CNN) -- Remember Alex from Target? He took the Internet by storm this week with his good looks and strong work ethic, causing many to swoon and others to curse the power of social media. Now a tech startup is claiming responsibility for making #alexfromtarget one of the ""most amazing social media experiments ever."" But it's unclear whether the company really deserves the credit. The CEO of Breakr, a company that claims to connect ""fans with their fandom,"" said in a LinkedIn post Tuesday that the company harnessed social media's ""powerful fangirl demographic"" to make Alex Lee, a real, 16-year-old Target employee from Texas, a global trending topic. According to Breakr, the company took the photo of Alex Lee that was posted by a Twitter user named Abbie (@auscalum) and fanned Twitter's flames, ""spreading the word amongst our fangirl followers to trend #AlexFromTarget."" The company says it then added ""fuel to the fire by tweeting about it to our bigger YouTube influencers."" The conversation then spread through people supporting the hashtag ""just to trend it"" and others raging over the fact that a guy could become ""Internet famous"" just for his looks, Breakr CEO Dil-Domine Jacobe Leonares said. People tweeted parody images and created YouTube videos while the media, including CNN, published stories about it. ""It was based on looks,"" Leonares told CNN late Tuesday. ""You put a good looking guy in front of girls, girls are going to go crazy over him."" But not everyone's buying Breakr's trending power. Many have raised an interesting question: Isn't revealing the ""man behind the curtain,"" so to speak, a giant no-no in the social media world? Adding to the confusion are Alex and Abbie themselves. The ""fangirl"" Leonares credited with boosting the trend and ""Alex from Target"" both posted on Twitter that they have no connection to Breakr. Breakr later clarified that Abbie's not an employee, but simply a Twitter user whose tweet the company claims to have amplified. That backtracking is just one reason why David Orr, who claims to be one of the largest social media influencers on Twitter, is also skeptical about Breakr's involvement. ""Breakr is already backing down on their claims and is trying to make it clear that they never employed @auscalum,"" Orr wrote in an e-mail to CNN. ""Breakr is extremely vague on their actual relationship with her, alex, or what influence they actually had."" Orr says #AlexFromTarget really started trending when @GirlPosts tweeted it out. The account has nearly 5 million followers, and the photo was retweeted more than 20,000 times, and favorited by 44,000 people.","Breakr CEO claims credit for making #AlexFromTarget a global trending topic .
