"Rugby union has a doping problem, with one former international coach claiming that there has been ‘institutionalised drug-taking’ since the game turned professional. In a week when Bonymaen’s Nick Clancy became the 10th rugby union player in the UK this year to be suspended for doping offences, the most senior figure in English rugby has admitted that the sport has an issue with drugs that urgently needs to be tackled. Less than a year before England stages the 2015 World Cup, Ian Ritchie, the Rugby Football Union’s chief executive, said: ‘Whichever way you look at it I think there is recognition that there is a problem. former France and Harlequins prop Laurent Benezech lifted the lid on doping in rugby . ‘We are addressing this and not putting it under the carpet. We’re recognising this is an issue.’ Ritchie and the RFU point to the fact that, although 15 of the 43 banned athletes or coaches listed by UK Anti-Doping are from rugby union, the vast majority of players come from the junior ranks. Indeed Ritchie was responding to figures which appear to show that professional rugby’s endless drive for players to become bigger, stronger and faster is placing sometimes intolerable pressures on young players to take performance-enhancing drugs. But The Mail on Sunday has spoken to a former international coach who believes it is naive to think the problem is limited to young players trying to take a short cut to the professional ranks. Speaking to this newspaper under condition of anonymity, the former coach, who has worked extensively in England, says he walked away from the professional game in disgust at the scale of drug-taking. RFU chief Ian Ritchie (right) recognises there's a problem with performance-enhancing drugs . Laurent Benezech is the former France and Harlequins prop who dared compare drug use in French rugby to cycling, claiming it is as rife as it was in the Tour de France peloton at the height of the Festina scandal in 1998. For speaking out he risked losing everything. The French players’ union issued a writ on behalf of their 134 members, with each player wanting €2,000 in costs — a total of more than £200,000. A French court cleared him of defamation in September. Benezech, who claimed he was given the banned substance cortisone during the 1995 World Cup, questioned the physical size of the modern professional rugby player, his concern sparked by individuals who were somehow gaining 20kg of muscle in a single season. The 47-year-old said such a gain could not be achieved naturally . ‘I’m sure there was the odd player taking drugs before the sport went professional,’ said the former coach. ‘But what I found abhorrent was the institutionalised drug-taking that came in in the professional era. ‘Players are being told to bulk up, and it’s being spelled out to them in no uncertain terms that the way to bulk up is to take drugs. ‘You can’t become as big as the players are becoming without a serious amount of drug-taking. Once a core of players take drugs, get bigger and win places, the only way other players can compete is by taking drugs too. It’s a problem that has engulfed the sport and I wanted no part of it. Be assured, you don’t get a physique like a modern-day rugby player by eating grilled fish and doing press-ups.’ The size and power of professional players has increased dramatically in the past two decades. An investigation by The Mail on Sunday earlier this year found that the average weight of an international player today is more than two stones greater than when the game turned professional in 1995. England's Steffon Armitage was cleared of intentionally doping after testing positive for morphine . Last year’s England Under 18s who took on Wales weighed more than 2lb per man more than the England side who lost to Australia in the 1991 World Cup final. Meanwhile, a recent study of South African schoolboy players returned 12 positive tests for anabolic steroids out of just 52 undertaken. Our whistleblower’s astonishing claims of ‘institutionalised doping’ in the professional game will set alarm bells ringing among rugby’s administrators. They are desperate to avoid falling into the same trap which saw sponsors leave cycling in their droves in the wake of a succession of scandals, which culminated in Lance Armstrong being stripped of his seven Tour de France titles. In September, former France and Harlequins prop Laurent Benezech was found not guilty of defamation by the High Court in Paris for alleging that rugby is in precisely the same state of denial that gripped cycling before the infamous Festina affair in 1998, starting a process which almost brought the sport to its knees. Benezech, 47, claims he was unwittingly, and illegally, administered cortisone by French team doctors during the 1995 World Cup and believes that unreasonable demands placed on players by coaches desperate for short-term success have led to a culture of drug use. Bonymaen’s Nick Clancy became the 10th rugby union player in the UK this year to be suspended . ‘When I meet rugby players and I see, for example, a change in their jaw, which is the mark of human growth hormone, I can only be concerned about the long-term evolution of my sport and the health of its players,’ said Benezech. ‘Rugby is in exactly the same situation as before the Festina cycling business.’ It is impossible to know just how deep rugby’s doping problem runs. But there has been growing concern since the advent of professionalism that the increasing physical demands placed on players and the refusal by administrators to reduce the frequency of matches has inevitably led to some opting to cheat. Nicola Newman, the director of communications and education at UK Anti-Doping, who run the RFU’s testing programme, said the evidence points to more of a problem in the junior ranks than at elite level but agrees that questions should be asked across the whole of rugby union. ‘I think it’s a really important conversation to be having,’ said Newman. ‘There is an issue in rugby, and this is something the RFU have acknowledged. But what we don’t know, and will probably never know, is how big an issue it is. South Africa and Toulouse hooker Chiliboy Ralepelle has been provisionally suspended . ‘What we are acknowledging, based on evidence, is a trend towards younger players testing positive. The evidence suggests younger players and players at lower levels are trying to get into the top level by using banned substances. ‘Our understanding is that it is easy to buy steroids, but there are an awful lot of risks involved. The substances could be anything. They will have no idea of the dosages. But it is not illegal to buy steroids for personal use. It is only illegal to sell them or supply to others.’ Newman says the RFU are committed to cracking down on drug use. Of the 536 tests carried out last year, about 75 per cent were out of competition and a certain number of players are on the National Registered Testing Pool, which means they have to inform UKAD of their whereabouts and can be tested ‘anytime, anyplace, anywhere’. The RFU also have a separate testing programme to tackle the use of illicit drugs and earlier this year they commissioned researchers from the Institute for Sport, Physical Activity and Leisure at Leeds Metropolitan University and Kingston University to look into the abuse of ‘performance and image-enhancing substances in male adolescent rugby union players’. The RFU now employ two full-time anti-doping officers and last month their fourth annual report into the subject concluded: ‘The next phase of anti-doping activity in England should maintain the education and deterrents that are manifestly successful in keeping the game clean at the senior elite level.’ But, while it may be convenient for rugby to direct attention at the junior level where some teenagers — including Sam Chalmers, the son of former Scotland international Craig — are lured into abusing steroids in a bid to secure contracts, it is inconceivable that cheating does not occur in the professional game. Ralepelle (right) escaped punishment despite testing positive for a banned substance in 2010 . ‘I’d been getting under pressure. A lot of people say you’ve got the skills and stuff — you just need to put on weight, get bigger,’ said Chalmers, who is serving a two-year ban after testing positive for two anabolic steroids at a Scotland Under 20 training camp in 2013. ‘One day, I just thought I’ll get what my friend’s taking. I didn’t look into it; I didn’t think about it at all, the effects, or if it could hurt me. But when you want something so bad, you’ll do anything.’ Chalmers bought the drugs legally on the internet and the availability of unregulated supplements and steroids online as well as in high-street gyms is now seen as a serious threat to all professional sports. South Africa and Toulouse hooker Chiliboy Ralepelle, who escaped punishment after testing positive for banned substance methylhexanamine following the Springboks’ clash with Ireland in 2010, is provisionally suspended following reports in the French media that he tested positive again in June, for anabolic steroid drostanalone. Two years ago Toulon’s former England flanker Steffon Armitage was cleared of intentionally doping after testing positive for morphine. But no positive results were returned in England last season. Ritchie added: ‘The current England squad are very serious and very committed, and they take advice on a lot of those things. ‘But you can’t be complacent about all this. We are very transparent about it. We recognise that there are things that are putting pressures on particular ages, whether that’s supplements or other things. But we are absolutely open, transparent and rigorous about education.’ Stephen Watkins, the RFU’s anti-doping and illicit drugs programme manager, said: ‘The RFU takes anti-doping extremely seriously and condemns all drug use in sport. All players, at every level, should be aware that they can be tested any time, anywhere.’","Bonymaen’s Nick Clancy became the 10th rugby union player in the UK this year to be suspended for doping offence .

"Chelsea target Douglas Costa has revealed he wants to play under Jose Mourinho and believes the Blues boss would aid his progress as a player. The current Premier League leaders have increased their offer for the Shakhtar Donetsk midfielder to £18.7million having had an opening bid of £16million rejected on Thursday evening, according to the player himself. However, Costa claims the Ukranian champions have said they will help him after he made clear his desire to move to Stamford Bridge. Shakhtar Donetsk's Douglas Costa says it would be a 'dream' to play for Premier League leaders Chelsea . Brazilian midifleder Costa has spoken of his desire to play under Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho . Speaking to GloboESporte.com, the 24-year-old spoke of his desire to play under Mourinho at Chelsea and said: 'To play at Chelsea is a dream for any player. It is standing next to some of the best players in the world and competing with the world's best as well. 'But really, what catches my eye is the coach. He is a very intelligent coach and has been victorious wherever he went. One of the things that would make me happier to act at Chelsea would be this. Having spent five years in Donetsk under Shakhtar boss Mircea Lucescu, Costa believes Mourinho could take his game to the next level. The Blues have increased their offer for Costa to £18.7million having had an initial bid of £16m rejected . 'I learned a lot here with Lucesc,' said the Brazil international. 'I arrived at Shakhtar aged 19 and he taught me a lot. I am very grateful. But I also know that with Mourinho at Chelsea, my progress would be even greater. 'He has won just about everything. He is among the best, if not the best. He is at the top.'

"Celtic boss Ronny Deila has revealed how he failed in a last-gasp bid to snatch Norwegian wonderkid Martin Odegaard from under the nose of Real Madrid. But he believes it’s still possible he could land his 16-year-old former Stromsgodset protege on loan from the European champions. Odegaard joined the Spanish giants on Thursday in a £2.3million deal which could see him go on to earn a whopping £80,000 a week. While Deila has backed him to have a fantastic career in Madrid, he’s ready to offer him the chance to get some game time under his belt if he fails to break into Carlo Ancelotti’s first-team. Martin Odegaard holds his shirt after being unveiled as a  Real Madrid player . Asked if he kept trying to land Odegaard until the final minutes of the Real Madrid deal, Deila said: ‘Yes, I was speaking with him. I hoped to get him to Celtic and I met him and his father and I talked with them. ‘I knew all the way that it was going to be hard. I didn’t put much into it. I just said to him that Celtic was an option. That here, he would have a better chance to play. That this could be a between step to the biggest clubs. ‘I have a good relationship with Martin and his father and they called me up the day they chose Real Madrid. There’s not many times in your life you get the option to go there so when you get the chance it’s good. I understand his choice. It’s not going to ruin his career. Odegaard poses with Sergio Ramos (left) and Cristiano Ronaldo after signing on Thursday . ‘Is there a chance I could get him on loan? You never know in football. This could be possible, but we also want players that we own or can make money from of course.’ While the chance of Celtic borrowing European football’s hottest talent from one of the continent’s biggest clubs seems fanciful, there is perhaps method in Deila’s madness. One of the conditions Odegaard’s father Hans Erik has put in place with Madrid is that his son doesn’t play third-tier football next year. Odegaard grins after hearing a question during the press conference on Thursday . At the moment he will go straight into the Madrid B-team for what is left of the season under the tutelage of Zinedine Zidane. The idea is that he helps the France legend to promotion from one of Spain’s regional third divisions. If the B-team go up then Odegaard will spend most of next season training with the first team but getting match practice with the B-side. If, however, Zidane is unsuccessful and they remain in the third tier this could present an opportunity for Deila to take advantage of his close relationship with the player. The Celtic manager insisted Odegaard is not the sort go off the rails after joining such a big club so young. ‘If I was asked to rate Martin’s attitude from one to 100, it is 100,’ he said. ‘He takes very quickly to each level he reaches. He’s the guy who trains the most, he’s very humble and very, very mature as a boy. He has the attitude to succeed and just loves playing football. ‘Money is not the issue for him. In Norway, money is okay so that’s not the biggest problem. ‘It’s an exciting move and it’s very hyped in Norway. It’s the biggest thing that ever happened. He’s the first Norwegian player to join Madrid. I’m happy for him. It’s going to be so exciting to see how far he can reach.’","Wonderkid Martin Odegaard will earn up to £80,000 a week at Real Madrid .

"Nani believes he could still have a future at Manchester United despite being allowed to spend the entire season on loan at Sporting Lisbon. The Portugal winger was sacrificed by Louis van Gaal as part of the deal that saw Marcos Rojo join United last summer. But Nani, 28, has more than three years still remaining on his Old Trafford contract, and insists it was his choice to head back to his homeland. 28-year-old Nani is on loan at Sporting Lisbon this season after two injury hit seasons at Manchester United . Nani celebrates with Wayne Rooney during the opening day defeat to Swansea at Old Trafford in August . 'The club know my value and I know they want me to stay,' he told the Manchester Evening News. 'It was me who made the choice to leave the club and it was a good decision by me because I knew if I stayed one more season at Old Trafford, it would be very hard for me. 'I just need someone to believe in me, trust me and my qualities, and give me an opportunity to show them on the pitch.' The Portugal international added: 'It's an experience I wanted a lot and needed as well because the last two seasons at Manchester United I had so many injuries and I was very upset with a lot of things that happened to me. 'I was missing my family and friends and I wanted something new. The only opportunity I had to be happy, and Manchester United to be happy as well, was this one.'

"Bradford co-chairman Mark Lawn is dreaming of being paired with Manchester United after his Bantams dumped Chelsea out of the FA Cup on a day of shocks on Saturday. Bradford fought back from 2-0 down at Stamford Bridge to claim the biggest upset of the day, if not the entire tournament - no mean feat considering Manchester City, Southampton and Tottenham also lost to supposedly inferior opposition on Saturday - and their 4-2 victory earned the League One side a place in the fifth round. The Bantams have a recent history of giant-killing - beating Arsenal and Aston Villa to reach the 2013 Capital One Cup final - and, after ending the Premier League leaders' interest in this season's FA Cup, Lawn hopes to be pitted against Louis van Gaal's Red Devils when the fifth-round draw is made on Monday evening. Bradford's players celebrate in front of their travelling fans after the full-time whistle at Stamford Bridge . Bradford co-chairman Mark Lawn is dreaming of a fifth round FA Cup tie against Manchester United . United, of course, are not guaranteed a place in the next round after they were held to a goalless draw at Cambridge on Friday, but Lawn has his hopes pinned on an Old Trafford tie. 'My wife's a big Man United fan, so hopefully (we get) Man United away,' he told Sky Sports News. Bradford's victory over Jose Mourinho's expensively assembled team is likely to live long in their fans' memory, and Lawn does not believe scalps come any bigger. 'It's like (beating) Barcelona, for me,' he said. 'It's like winning at a top, top European side. That's what Chelsea are - Chelsea are a top, top European side. Chelsea's players are left dejected after Bradford staged a stunning comeback on Saturday . 'I don't think there's one single Bradford City fan that would turn around and say, 'I think it (their cup run) is a distraction'. 'Beating Chelsea has made our season.' Lawn's wish for a fifth-round encounter against 11-time winners United was echoed by the man who masterminded Saturday's extraordinary triumph. Jon Stead (right) rifled in a sturnning strike for Bradford to make it 2-1 and give the visitors some hope . Bradford manager Phil Parkinson could be excused for wanting the easiest tie possible, but he too hopes to take on the likes of Wayne Rooney, Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao. 'If I had my choice, I'd like to play Manchester United,' he said. 'The experience we had (on Saturday), going to Stamford Bridge was just terrific. If Manchester United can manage to beat Cambridge, it would be great to go to Old Trafford. Felipe Morais (right) celebrates making it 2-2 as Cesar Azpilicueta and Petr Cech look on helplessly . 'But, whoever we get, it's great to be in the fifth round. We're enjoying being in the limelight.' Parkinson oversaw the League Cup victories over Arsenal and Aston Villa, but believes the Chelsea win was his best yet - even if Mourinho made several changes to his side. 'The night we beat Arsenal they played a full-strength team, but it was a night set up for a cup shock with a pitch starting to get a little bit frosty,' he said. 'It was a freezing cold night in Bradford, with all the elements for a cup shock. Andy Halliday calmly slots home to make it 3-2 and cap a remarkable comeback for Bradford . 'Going down there to Stamford Bridge, with a fantastic playing surface and 40,000 people behind them, to beat the league leaders and one of the best teams in Europe has to top the Arsenal victory.' Chelsea took a 2-0 lead through Gary Cahill and Ramires, but Jon Stead pulled a goal back before half-time before goals from Filipe Morais, Andy Halliday and Mark Yeates completed the upset. 'It's really just about giving the lads the belief to go out there and put on their best performance,' Parkinson added. Mark Yeates beats the Chelsea defence and slots home past Petr Cech to make it 4-2 to Bradford . 'We respected Chelsea, but we certainly didn't fear them. We weren't going to back off them and give them the ball in our half. When they came into the middle third we pressed them aggressively and that was the key. 'We didn't give them any time on the ball and they're not used to that at that level. When we had the ball ourselves we played with real calmness and I'm really pleased because it's so important. These days don't come along very often and when they do it's great we made the most of it. The lads really did themselves credit.'","Bradford shocked Chelsea 4-2 in the fourth round of the FA Cup .

"Always expect the unexpected with Australian prodigy Nick Kyrgios as just when his fourth-round clash against Andreas Seppi at his home Grand Slam hit an incredible climax, the teenager caught spectators leaving. The intense last-16 match saw Kyrgios comeback from two sets down and save a match point before booking a quarter-final spot against Andy Murray on Tuesday. The Hisense Arena was packed to the rafters to witness their new national hero, appropriately on Australia Day, but the 19-year-old failed to entertain three fans with his exploits, who attempted to leave the stands at 2-0 in the final set.

And in the heat of the moment, Kyrgios interrupted his own match as he called out at the fans: 'Oi! Where are you going?' as the crowd laughed. With the roaring crowd yelling out 'boo' at the three fans, they immediately seated themselves back down as they giggled and appeared humiliated. Kyrgios served his way out of trouble to notch a magical 5-7 4-6 6-3 7-6(5) 8-6 win to overcome the Italian, who had upset Swiss superstar Roger Federer in the third round. Last Australian standing at the tennis tournament and the first to reach the quarter-finals since a decade ago by Lleyton Hewitt.

'Thank you everybody - much appreciated and hope we could just go one more. When asked if he believed his son could pull through after being two-sets to love down, he responded: 'With the crowd pushing the way it was - his done it before - so his done it again.

His mobility restricted and explosive power diminished, Kyrgios obliterated a racquet at one point, such was his frustration at being unable to compete at full capacity early on. Seppi won the opening set after breaking Kyrgios to love in the 11th game. Kyrgios grew more and more frustrated as he squandered multiple break points in the fourth game of the second set, almost apologetically telling spectators: 'I'm trying man. I can't walk, though.' After fending off a break point in the fifth game, Kyrgios couldn't hold the Italian out again and found himself in a deep, deep hole after dropping serve for a second time in the ninth game - and then the second set. But Kyrgios began to mount his stirring fightback as his back appeared to free up in the third set, which the Australian claimed after breaking Seppi for the first time.

Kyrgios then unleashed a withering backhand winner down the line on his first set point to force the decider. Australia's last hope followed up with a vicious down-the-line forehand winner to break Seppi again to seemingly have the veteran on the ropes. But he inexplicably dropped serve to love in an alarming run of 12 straight points to Seppi, who drew level at 4-4 and then had a break point to give himself the opportunity to serve out the match.

"Trial: Ray Teret (pictured last month), 73, faces historical sexual allegations from 17 women . Jimmy Savile once lived in a black-painted room in a derelict property that was ‘like a haunted house’, a former DJ accused of helping him rape a girl told a court yesterday. Ray Teret, who the jury heard has a separate conviction for having sex with an underage girl, is accused of raping the 15-year-old moments after she had been attacked by Savile in the early 1960s. Giving evidence in his defence, the 73-year-old former Radio Caroline presenter recalled how Savile – who had taught him how to DJ – lived alone in just one room in an otherwise tumbledown house at the time. ‘It was a big old rambling Victorian square building,’ he said. ‘A house of three floors, totally detached. It was like a haunted house. ‘It was a joke really. It was derelict. There were no lights in the corridor. There was just one room at the front. When he moved into it all the plaster had come off the walls. He got a doorman he knew to fill it all in matt black. He didn’t have a television. He didn’t have a kettle.’ Teret,  of Altrincham, Greater Manchester, faces historical sexual allegations from 17 women who say he sexually abused them in various decades from the 1960s to the 1990s. One of the alleged victims says she was raped aged 15 by Teret almost immediately after she was raped by Savile in a flat when the defendant had driven her from a disco. Ex-Radio Caroline DJ Teret, 73, denies 18 rapes, two other serious sexual assaults, one attempted rape, 11 indecent assaults and two counts of indecency with a child. Before he went into the witness box at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court to give evidence in his defence the jury was told that Teret was convicted in March 1999 of having unlawful intercourse with a girl under 16. He had pleaded not guilty at Manchester Crown Court to the offence committed in February 1998. Outlining his personal background, Teret told his barrister, Nicholas Johnson, how he first met Savile in the late 1950s when the then Mecca dancehall manager presented him with £5 for winning a singing contest at The Plaza ballroom in Oxford Street, Manchester. Teret said: ‘He was not known as Jimmy Savile then. It was Mr Savile. Black shirt, straight hair. He gave me the money. He didn't know who I was.’ He was later given a job there as a cleaner in return for his sixpence entry, he said. Teret went on to become a waiter at The Ritz ballroom in Manchester city centre and it was there that he met Savile again who remembered him as ‘the singer’. Mr Johnson asked him: ‘Did he offer you a job?’ The defendant replied: ‘He said he had now left Mecca and said he was going to open a club in Broughton. Former broadcaster: One of Teret's alleged victims says she was raped aged 15 by Teret almost immediately after she was raped by Jimmy Savile (above) in a flat when the defendant had driven her from a disco . ‘He said he was going to run it. Salford Council had offered him this building to see if he could make some business. Saturday night was empty and would he like to set up a disco for over-16s. ‘He wanted me to be a trainee disc jockey. That I would learn how to do it properly, how to do the presentation, how to make people dance and not stop. ‘The fact that Mr Savile had two decks himself and he was in this hall on the stage that was quite high, I was quite excited to be in that environment.’ He said that initially Savile wanted him to come down to what became Jimmy Savile's Disc Club and observe from the back of the hall. ‘I had to sit there for the whole four hours and at the end of it Mr Savile would say ""see you next week"",’ he told the jury. ‘That was it for four weeks.’ At the end of the fourth week he told him to come in at 7am the next week, he said. Teret said: ‘He explained how to count the beats on the record, the tempo. How to project to the back of the hall rather than shouting, things like that. ‘He told me to do the first hour which was nerve-wracking. I was learning to be a disc jockey. He said to me if I came every week he would give me five shillings for my bus fare.’ Mr Johnson asked him if there were rules at the club about fraternising with customers. He replied: ‘When I first came in my job was to walk around and say good evening to everyone but we could not fraternise as in boyfriend/girlfriend ways.’ Savile lived in a Victorian house in Great Clowes Street, Higher Broughton, near to the club, the jury has heard. Mr Johnson said the woman who complained she had been raped by Teret and Savile said she had met Teret earlier on a Friday night in the 1960s at the Rialto premises in Higher Broughton. Teret said that was not possible as he did not work Fridays. The alleged victim said Teret chatted her up on the dancefloor stage before he drove her in a green bubble car to a nearby property where Savile was. Teret said club rules prohibited anyone from sitting on stage and would lead to ejection. He said he had never driven a green bubble car. Mr Johnson asked him: ‘Did you ever take anyone back to a premises where Jimmy Savile was and both have sex with them?’ Teret replied: ‘I have never had sex with anyone in the same room and certainly not with Mr Savile.’ The complainant told the jury that her grandmother later went down to the Rialto to confront Teret about what the complainant said had happened. Teret denied that had taken place. He said: ‘No-one has ever approached me about anything like that at any time in my life.’ Another complainant recalled Teret driving her in a pale blue bubble car to meet Savile after they had previously kissed at Jimmy Savile's Disc Club night at the Rialto. Teret said: ‘I know nothing of that. The rules of kissing in the club were that you could only kiss someone on the hand. That's it.’ Mr Johnson asked: ‘Did you ever leave the disco while it was going on with a customer?’ The defendant said: ‘When I was not playing records, I was handing his (Savile's) records on the stage. I was not allowed to go to the loo. There was only two of us.’ His barrister went on: ‘Were you allowed to drive Mr Savile's bubble car?’ Teret replied: ‘I didn't have a licence. He would not insure his vehicle for anybody else.’ Mr Johnson said: ‘Did you ever take any girl or woman to see Mr Savile in a premises in or near Great Clowes Street (where Savile lived)?’ Teret replied: ‘No, Mr Savile did not have a phone in that building. I could not phone to make an appointment. The only appointment I had with him was “I will see you next week” and that was it.’ Two other men are on trial with Teret. Alan Ledger, 62, from Altrincham, denies a serious sexual assault, an indecent assault and one count of indecency with a child.

"Israel may have committed war crimes when commandos stormed an aid ship in 2010 killing nine people, but officials will not be prosecuted because the offences are 'not serious enough'. Eight Turks and one Turkish-American died after crack troops opened fire on the crew of the Mavi Marmara in the early hours of May 31, 1010. The incident, which happened in international waters, sparked international condemnation and led to years of tense relations between Turkey and Israel. Today prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said that 'there is a reasonable basis to believe that war crimes were committed on  the Mavi Marmara' but were 'not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the International Criminal Court (ICC).' Lawyers at the International Criminal Court have ruled that Israel likely committed war crimes against the crew of the Mavi Marmara in 2010, but that the case does not warrant prosecution . Nine Turks died when Israeli troops storming the boat opened fire - the crew claim the soldiers fired without warning, while Israel says they shot after being attacked (pictured, activists hold a Israeli troop) He added: 'Without in any way minimizing the impact of the alleged crimes on the victims and their families... the ICC shall prioritise war crimes committed on a large scale.' Israel's Foreign Ministry welcomed the decision to close the probe, saying the case was 'legally unfounded and politically motivated.' A spokesman for the ministry sought to point out that the court had also chosen not to act over violence against its soldiers by activists on board the Mavi Marmara. The boat, the flagship of a six-craft flotilla aimed at breaking the blockade of Gaza and carrying 10,000 tons of aid to shore, was caught in a stand-off with Israel after being stopped at sea. In the early hours of May 31 the ship was stormed by commandos who dropped on to the deck from a helicopter and used ropes to climb up the sides. Activists on board the ship claim the soldiers opened fire before boarding or issuing any warning, while Israel maintains the soldiers only fired after troops were beaten with sticks and metal poles. The case was taken to the ICC last year after the tiny African state of Comoros - which is a member of the court - filed a complaint, as the ship was flying under a Comoros flag. Neither Turkey nor Israel are not part of the ICC, which only has jurisdiction over member states. A Turkish lawyer representing Comoros has vowed not to give up the case. The Mavi Mara was the flagship of a six-boat flotilla that was trying to bring 10,000 tons of aid to Gaga when it was stopped in international waters. After a standoff with Israeli forces, troops stormed the boat . Turkish lawyers have vowed not to give up the case, saying that the ICC prosecuted rebels who killed a similar number of African peacekeepers in Darfur (pictured, a wounded Israeli commando is taken away by rebels) Ramazan Ariturk said: 'This is a moral struggle that we're pursuing by ourselves. It's a legal struggle, a struggle in the name of humanity. This struggle isn't over. 'We will object to a higher court at the International Criminal Court and we believe without a doubt that we will prevail.' In a 61-page report, prosecutors concluded that 'there is a reasonable basis to believe' Israeli wilfully killed, wilfully caused serious injury and deprived passengers of dignity. The report said that the findings were based on 'information available at this stage', adding that none of the information was collected by the ICC. A U.N. report in July 2011 found that the raid was justified, but that Israel used excessive force. Turkish lawyers seeking an ICC case turned to Comoros because the tiny nation is a member of the court and the Mavi Marmara was registered under the country's flag. They pointed to another ICC case, in Sudan, in which the court prosecuted rebels accused of leading an attack on African Union peacekeepers in Darfur in which 11 people died. Arituk said the ICC was setting a double standard by recognising the gravity of 11 troops being killed, but ignoring the nine protesters. In their report, prosecutors addressed the similarities in the number of victims in the two cases, but added there was also a key difference, as Darfur rebels' attack was deliberate.","International Criminal Court rules there is basis to say war crimes took place .

"During the trial choirmaster David Mason (pictured) claimed his abuse had no 'evil intent' and was a 'natural thing' A choirmaster who claimed to stand up for 'Christian values and ethics' has been jailed for sexually abusing a six-year-old girl. David Mason, 71, from Riverside, Brighton-Le-Sands, near Crosby, pleaded guilty to three charges of indecent assault on his victim when she was between the ages of six and nine in the early nineties. The father of two, who was jailed for ten years, said he stood up for 'Christian values and ethics' but a judge who heard his trial told him those claims were hollow and he was a man of 'warped values'. Mason denied other allegations including indecency with a child and attempted rape, forcing his victim to relive years of abuse by giving evidence before a jury during which he branded her 'a fantasist' with a tendency to exaggerate. Liverpool Crown Court heard that Mason encouraged the young girl to engage in various  sex acts. During his trial he made claims which the judge branded 'extraordinary nonsense', saying that the abuse was 'light-hearted, it wasn't horrible'. 'There was no evil intent, no nasty hurting intent, it was a natural thing.' He said the girl would sit 'coquettishly' and showed a lot of leg and that she would take her clothes off and run around 'teasing' him and even claimed she had 'hoaxed' him into being alone with her, leading to 'rough and tumble'. Mason said she was 'exploring her sexuality with him'. Judge Andrew Hatton, said: 'She was an eight-year-old girl. You were suggesting that an eight-year-old girl was flirting with you.' Speaking of the attempted rape he said Mason's words to her had lived with her all her life and continued to chill her. Mason, who was of previous good character, was found guilty of three counts of indecency with a child, two of indecent assault and one of attempted rape. He was found not guilty of one count of indecency with a child. He was jailed for 10 years and put on the sex offenders register for the rest of life. A jury at Liverpool Crown Court (pictured) found Mason guilty of three counts of indecency, two of indecent assault and one charge of attempted rape . Detective Sergeant Paul Donaghy said: 'His victim has shown an immense amount of bravery in coming forward and having to re-live the abuse she suffered at Mason's hands. 'I hope his sentencing gives her some sense of closure and also provides wider reassurance that a dangerous and determined sex offender is now behind bars. 'I would like to reassure anyone who has been a victim of sexual abuse that any complaint will be taken extremely seriously and investigated by specially-trained officers who will offer support every step of the way.'","Choirmaster David Mason jailed for abusing six-year-old in the early nineties .

"Manager Vincenzo Montella has insisted Chelsea can only sign Juan Cuadrado from Fiorentina by paying his £26.8m release clause. Chelsea have so far offered £20m plus bonuses but Fiorentina coach Montella said: 'The issue around Cuadrado is very simple: he has a buy-out clause, which was written into his contract along with the club. If a team comes along and pays it, and the player wants to leave, then he can go. Juan Cuadrado (centre) celebrates after scoring against Atalanta to reach the Copa Italia quarter-finals . Chelsea are reportedly ready to meet the winger's £26.8m buyout clause to bring him to Stamford Bridge .

"Child abuse has been 'rampant' in the Church of England and other British institutions, the Archbishop of Canterbury has said. Justin Welby also said there is a 'significant legacy' of cases of child abuse within the church which have been ignored and that its failure to hold abusers to account is 'inexcusable'. Archbishop Welby made the admissions in a private letter to a mother of three boys who were abused at a Church of England school, reports Exaro, the investigative website. Frank admission: Archbishop Justin Welby has admitted that there is a 'significant legacy of unacknowledged cases' within the church and that its failure to 'face the misdeeds of those in its service is inexcusable' Writing to a Hertfordshire mother whose sons were groomed and sexually abused by their headmaster, Welby apologised for the church's failure to root out peadophiles. 'I read your story with the same deep sense of sadness and dismay that I have felt on far too many other, similar accounts. 'The betrayal of Christ in such behaviour is complete; the church's failure to face the misdeeds of those in its service is inexcusable. 'I can only apologise for what happened then, and for what has happened now, most sincerely and with deep sorrow. 'It is now clear that in a huge number of institutions and localities, the abuse of children and vulnerable adults has been rampant. 'That is not in any way mitigation or excuse for the church, but is why I have been, with [Durham bishop] Paul Butler, pushing for the public inquiry that the government has promised.' Saying sorry: Justin Welby made the comments in a letter to a Hertfordshire mother whose sons were groomed and sexually abused by their headmaster at a Church of England school in the early noughties . 'It is also clear that there is a very significant legacy of unacknowledged cases in the Church of England. We are taking all necessary steps to face these.' Marilyn Hawes says she had tried and failed on several occasions to get an apology from the church, before finally getting a response from Welby. Ms Hawes, a former music teacher who now runs an anti-abuse charity, first wrote to Rowan Williams in 2003 after her sons' abuser was convicted. The headmaster was sentenced to 15 months in prison. She wrote: 'I have been an active church-goer my whole life - 50 years - and for the first time I am doubting, not my faith, but the sincerity, value and integrity of a church community.' She received a two-paragraph, routine reply from an official, but decided to try to contact the church again after Welby was appointed as archbishop of Canterbury last year. She wrote that the church community 'abandoned' her, saying: 'I went on to have a nervous breakdown and suicidal thoughts. People would cross the road or exit the Post Office rather than face me. Nobody from the church cared.' Her sons, now adults, had 'achieved great things', she wrote, and had 'overcome the sexual abuse'. However, she added, 'Nobody in any church has shown them any active help.' Welby's comments come as the CoE plans to roll out training on safeguarding children for all its clergy. Tim Loughton, former children's minister, said: 'The new archbishop should be congratulated for clearly focussing on the wrongs of the past throughout the church and his determination that every effort should be made to prevent them again in the future.'","Archbishop said abuse has been 'rampant' in CoE and other institutions .

"Police forces across Britain are investigating 7,500 child abuse allegations, including historic cases at children's care homes. The greatest number of investigations are taking place in London and West Yorkshire, where collectively almost 3,000 abuse claims have been made, a report says.

Scotland Yard are holding 1,800 inquiries into abuse allegations in London, while West Yorkshire Police are conducting another 1,100 inquiries. Many of the vulnerable young people involved are living in children's homes, the report says, as were the victims of previous abuse scandals in Rotherham and Rochdale. Children as young as 16 are being abandoned without anywhere to live, the report, named Couldn't Care Less, claims. Thousands are running away from children’s homes, with many then placed in unsuitable bed and breakfast accommodation, it adds. LBC's report also criticises the areas children are made to live in.

"Blackburn did their bit on a weekend of Cup upsets to book a place in the fifth round, but it remains to be seen if strikers Rudy Gestede and Jordan Rhodes will still be at the club when that game comes around next month. Manager Gary Bowyer brought his two stars off the bench at Ewood Park, and it was Gestede who made the breakthrough as nine-man Swansea crashed out. The Benin striker is set to join Crystal Palace before the transfer window closes if the two clubs can agree a fee of up to £5million, while £12m-rated Rhodes continues to interest top-flight teams. With Blackburn £79.8m in debt and operating under a transfer embargo, the dilemma is clear: by selling their prize assets to reduce that figure Indian owners Venky’s could also be killing off the club’s fading hopes of promotion back to the Premier League. It’s enough to drive some managers to distraction but Bowyer will accept if Gestede and Rhodes are sold.

All you do is dust yourself down, wish them all the best and crack on. ‘I would obviously put my opinion forward but at the end of the day the owners of the club are there to make the financial decisions.’ Blackburn’s passage to the next round was smoothed by the sixth-minute dismissal of Swansea defender Kyle Bartley. Gylfi Sigurdsson was then shown a straight red for a crude challenge in added time and will now miss Premier League fixtures against Southampton, Sunderland and West Brom.

"Parking ‘pirates’ are accused of issuing thousands of bogus penalty notices to travellers using railway station car parks on a busy commuter line. Fines of £100 a time were handed out when drivers stayed beyond the permitted period at car parks belonging to Chiltern Railways. But MET Parking Services was using the wrong law to issue the tickets, and is now accused of demanding money under false pretences from as many as 40,000 commuters. Scroll down for video . Les Bradley, 70 and his wife Annie Bradley, 66 from Herne Bay, Kent. Mr Bradley is being hounded for £1,000 even though he bought a parking ticket (see Fact Box below for full story) The firm, which manages car parks on the line between Marylebone and Birmingham, admitted that 1,025 tickets were incorrectly issued and that 679 still outstanding at the beginning of the year were cancelled. A pensioner is facing a £1,000 fine despite paying for his rail parking ticket. Les Bradley, 70, even received a text message confirming he had paid the £3.30 charge. But he claims the parking company has ignored the evidence. And he condemned the ‘heavy-handed’ tactics of Meteor Parking for forcing ‘easy touches’ to cough up. Mr Bradley parked his car at Herne Bay, in Kent (right), at 4.40am on April 14 and paid £3.30 at the ticket machine for a day’s parking. He thought nothing more about it as he left on a round trip to Newcastle for a meeting. But when he returned at 10pm, he was outraged to find a £65 fine from Meteor Parking, which runs the car park on behalf of Southeastern. After contacting the firm, he heard nothing more and assumed the ticket had been cancelled. But two months later he received a letter ordering him to pay up or face a £1,000 fine. He said: ‘I was really mad about it all – you can’t talk to anybody and they don’t seem to take any notice of what you’re telling them. ‘Are they just a money-making machine attacking the easy touches with heavy-handed techniques? 'I did everything by the book but they are still chasing me and now are threatening me…and ignoring everything I say.’ Meteor Parking did not comment. The tickets were issued using a law introduced in 2012 which banned the use of wheel clamping on private land, but allowed the owners to issue penalty notices. However railway car parks are covered by different byelaws. Commuter Trevor Carvey took on MET after receiving a ticket in Ruislip, Middlesex. He used the Freedom of Information Act to discover MET was using automatic number plate recognition cameras to identify drivers via the DVLA database, then pursue them for payment – often with the threat of court action. ‘MET and Chiltern have been using completely the wrong law to police these car parks,’ he said. ‘Thousands of people have been given tickets under false pretences and they should be getting their money back.’ Mr Carvey said his attempts to persuade the British Parking Association (BPA) to take action against MET have been ignored. Last week the Mail revealed how MET also targeted McDonald’s customers with £100 penalty notices for staying too long in its restaurant car parks. MET chased motorists using a debt recovery firm that has been declared ‘unfit’ to operate by the Office of Fair Trading and a firm of solicitors shut down last year because of ‘dishonesty’. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has promised an inquiry into cowboy parking firms following revelations in the Daily Mail. He said that the firms should be prosecuted if found to be breaking consumer protection laws. Hospitals are under pressure to sack ‘pirate’ parking squads after it emerged more than three quarters of NHS trusts use them to police their car parks. Alex Shipp, who runs the Parking Prankster website, said up to 40,000 tickets may have been wrongly issued in Chiltern’s car parks. He believes the 1,025 tickets admitted to relate only to Ruislip between October 2012 and January this year. However MET is thought to have made the same mistake at all 21 of Chiltern’s car parks over the same period. ‘We need a full investigation. The DVLA and BPA should require that all the motorists involved are properly compensated,’ he said. ‘There is a very strong case to argue that this is a fraud and something the police should be looking at.’ The DVLA earns around £10million a year from private parking companies for the right to access its computer database. A spokesman said: ‘It is not within our powers to instruct private parking companies to offer refunds.’ A Chiltern Railways spokesman said: ‘MET Parking manages all Chiltern Railways car parks. We work closely with them to ensure that our parking policy is fair and communicated clearly.’ MET refused to comment.","£100 fines handed out when drivers outstayed permitted period at car parks belonging to Chiltern Railways .

"Millions of people given extortionate car parking charges outside train stations, NHS hospitals and supermarkets could be in line for a refund thanks to a new campaign. Cambridge law graduate Michael Green, 22, is leading a legal battle to have the 'fines' overturned in what could be Britain's largest ever group litigation. Private companies which run car parks outside some of Britain's biggest store chains - including Aldi, Lidl, B&Q and PC World - will often allow customers to park for free, but threaten a large fine for  exceeding a certain time limit. However, Mr Green believes that these fines are unlawful - and is trying to gather 100,000 cases together to go to the High Court and prove it. Clamping down: A new campaign is challenging extortionate penalty charge notices handed out by private companies outside hospitals, shops and train stations - and could get tens of millions of people a refund . If he wins the landmark legal case, then that could open the door for 'at least 10million people' to claim their money back, and could put a stop to the fines for good. He said: 'These ""fines"" are not official fines, but instead a matter of private law between two parties. 'When you park in a car park you are entering into a contract with the company which provides that parking space. 'If you breach a contract then under contract law that company is only allowed to make a claim for the amount they have actually lost. 'Because these spaces are free to park in, I would argue the amount is actually nothing. 'People take cases like this to the county court fairly regularly, and judges will often rule that the fines are unenforceable and the charge will be overturned. 'However, because of the way the county court system works, this will only settle the claim between one person and one company. 'By gathering the cases together, and taking it to the High Court, we can set a legal precedent.' When a judge made a similar ruling over PPI, it opened the door to a flood of claims that has seen banks set aside tens of billions of pounds in repayments. In the case of PPI, the ruling applied to 90 per cent of policies sold. Mr Green believes a new ruling could apply to 98 per cent of parking fines handed out by private companies. Raking it in: Money collected from parking charge notices has almost doubled in the last four years alone . Growing problem: Each time a private company issues a fine, they request the driver's details from the DVLA. This data shows that, in 2014 alone, nearly 2.7million fines will be issued . An estimated 2.2million such fines were handed out last year alone, and that number is set to rise to 2.7million this year. In total, it is estimated that these companies will collect around £127million in so-called 'fines' this year alone, almost double the £93million collected in 2010, and a 600 per cent increase on 2006, when just £21million was charged to motorists. Mr Green added: 'In my opinion [the charges] are unlawful. It is remarkable that the parking firms are happy to send out so many ""fines"", despite their legality not being clear. 'To make an estimated £176m industry out of this, without having clear legal precedent to do so, is concerning.' He is currently gathering interest on his Challenge the Fine website, before deciding whether to go ahead with the scheme. If enough people sign up, he will attempt to gather 100,000 cases together before going to court. He added: 'I think the law is pretty clear in this area, as evidenced by the conclusions of county court judges. 'But the law on how to organise such big cases is uncertain. We're going to be asking the judge some pretty novel questions so we might get some pretty novel answers.' Among the companies using the potentially illegal practices is UKPC, which manages spaces outside NHS hospitals, along high streets, and beside major retailers such as M&S and Tesco. Fighting back: Cambridge law graduate Michael Green is trying to gather 100,000 cases together to take to the High Court, which will make his case the biggest ever group litigation in UK history . Other companies include Parking Eye, which controls spaces outside many budget supermarkets including Asda, Lidl and Aldi, and Total Parking Services, which deals largely with shopping parks and stores such as B&Q and PC World. The companies will issue ‘parking charge notices’ – named to replicate official council ‘penalty charge notices’ – but which do not have the same legal standing as official fines. A growing number of people are refusing to pay, and because of this firms often follow the 'fines' with letters threatening court action, in the hope of browbeating people into submission. Simply ignoring the legal summons is not enough, and will often end up with a person being issued with a CCJ - which could prevent them from taking out loans or getting mortgages in the future. Mr Green, from Chatham in Kent, attended  Clare College at Cambridge University, earning a Bachelors degree in 2013, and passing a Law Masters in 2014, receiving some of the top grades in his year. Rather than begin training as a lawyer, he decided he wanted to start up a company giving everyday people greater access to the courts. The idea to help fight parking fines came to him after a friend was hit with an excessive charge. In the future, he also hope to help fight rouge telephone callers. One pensioner was hit with a £70 parking fine at a local NHS hospital after staying just 13 seconds too long. Marilyn Heald, pictured right, paid 50p to park for 30 minutes while she had an X-ray at the Samuel Johnson Community Hospital in Lichfield last month. The 64-year-old from Staffordshire was shocked when a fine for £70 from Parking Eye landed on her doorstep a week later. Cameras had recorded her entering the car park – before she even had a chance to park – at 10.14am and 47 seconds. It logged her leaving at 10.45am, meaning she was penalised just over £5 for each of the 13 extra seconds. Mrs Heald said: ‘I have no problem in paying to park at the hospital. I’m all for the hospital making money from it. 'But I don’t understand why they’re using some car park management company, like Parking Eye, who are just there literally to cash in as soon as they can.’ Mrs Heald appealed and the fine was waived. She said: ‘It seems to me that if you appeal they let you off – that’s what’s happened to lots of people I know. 'They’re not interested in pursuing it at all, they’re just after catching the poor innocent person who is going to pay up.’ When Natalie Marshman’s two-year-old son fell seriously ill and began having fits, she rushed him to Ormskirk hospital a couple of miles away. The 37-year-old parked at the children’s A&E unit and ran inside with her son and eight-month-old daughter. On her return, she was horrified to find she had been given a £60 fine for parking in the drop-off bay. She said: ‘I was stunned. There was no way I could leave one of my children behind in the car and I had to get my son into the hospital as quickly as possible.’ Her son had an infection of his lymph nodes and needed treatment for the next three weeks. Mrs Marshman, pictured left, said: ‘I was shocked they would ticket someone who was clearly in an emergency, but they just said: “You should have got an ambulance”.’ The mother of three refused to pay the fine on ‘moral grounds’, but it was increased to £100 and she received threatening letters from UKPC warning her of legal action. She said: ‘It was causing me and my partner immense stress, so in the end we had to pay.’ Mrs Marshman added that she was relieved the aggressive practices at Ormskirk hospital had been reined in by the management. ‘It was a disgrace,’ she said. ‘Many of these people are very sick and yet they are being targeted by a firm looking to make a profit.’ An 80-year-old diabetic was targeted by McDonald’s private parking wardens after suffering a medical emergency while parked at its outlet at Gatwick airport. Charlie Webley, right with his daughter Sharon, needed to wait at the restaurant longer than planned to ensure his blood sugar had stabilised before he could to drive on safely. Two days later a parking penalty notice arrived from MET Parking. It had captured the details of the car using automatic number plate recognition cameras and the official DVLA database. After the firm was told about his condition it doubled the charge from £50 to £100 because it was not paid within 14 days. Mr Webley, from Strood in Kent, had travelled to the airport last summer to pick up his daughter Sharon, who owns the car. Miss Webley, 54, said: ‘Effectively, we were sent a £100 penalty for over-staying by just 16 minutes.’ The civil servant launched a successful appeal to the independent tribunal service POPLA and the penalty was cancelled.","Millions of people given large 'fines' by private firms could be owed a refund .

"More than than eight million two-earner couples will be more than £1,330 better off on average next year as they gain a double benefit from the Government's flagship tax cuts. A Treasury analysis seen by the Daily Mail shows that 8.3 million families are winning twice from increases to the personal allowance for income tax, because both adults are in work. The amount of earnings on which no tax is paid will rise to £10,600 in April - the latest in a series of rises implemented by the coalition. Scroll down for video . Of the 8million families who are better off, 3.4million have children, including 300,000 in Scotland, 200,000 in Wales and 400,000 in the South East . The most detailed study to date on the impact of the reform shows nurses, care workers, sales assistants and teachers are among the occupations to have benefited most from the coalition’s most radical tax policy. People living in the South East have done best, with those in the North West next most likely to have benefited. Ministers will hail the figures as evidence of the most fundamental change in the personal tax system for a generation - implemented despite the need for austerity measures. However, they risk fuelling a row over the Government's decision to target support at two-earner families. Tory MPs have complained of a growing discrepancy in the tax system between increasingly generous support for working couples with children and that for parents where a spouse stays at home to look after the children. On top of income tax breaks, the coalition has committed to introduce ‘tax free childcare’ for dual earner couples worth up to £2,000 a year per child. The Chancellor is introducing a marriage tax allowance from next April designed to help one-earner couples, but it will be worth only around £200 a year. The married tax allowance will only apply to people paying the basic rate of tax, meaning that families with incomes above around £42,000 a year will not be helped. A total of 2.7million people will have been taken out of paying tax altogether when the personal allowance reaches £10,600 in April . Thousands of shop staff, care workers and nurses will be better off as a result of the personal allowance reaching £10,600 . David Cameron has suggested that a majority Conservative government would seek to go further, calling the tax break ‘very much a first step’. Labour and the Lib Dems are committed to scrapping the marriage tax allowance, however. Today's analysis also shows that 5.6 families with children have benefited from the tax allowance change - with half of those securing a double advantage because they have two parents in work. Dual income families would be better off by an average of £2,100 if the allowance was to rise to the target amount of £12,500, the policy of both the Conservatives and the Lib Dems. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said the 'Liberal Democrat flagship policy' had brought about the 'greatest revolution in the tax landscape for working people in living memory' Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said the 'Liberal Democrat flagship policy' had brought about the 'greatest revolution in the tax landscape for working people in living memory', . 'Many will remember that the Conservatives dismissed the policy during the leadership debates running up to the election in 2010 as unaffordable but Nick Clegg and I have fought tooth and nail to keep the successive rises in the personal allowance on the table at every Budget,' the Cabinet minister said. Mr Alexander's remarks are calculated to infuriate the Tories - who will today seek to put tax cuts at the heart of their campaign to stay in power. The coalition parties are engaged in a fierce battle to win credit from voters for the income tax breaks. 'Raising the personal allowance is an income tax cut for over 26 million working people worth £825 to typical basic rate taxpayers. And this new analysis reveals for the first time that dual earning households will be £1,330 better off on average,' Mr Alexander added. 'Many will remember that the Conservatives dismissed the policy during the leadership debates running up to the election in 2010 as unaffordable. 'But Nick Clegg and I have fought tooth and nail to keep the successive rises in the personal allowance on the table at every Budget. 'This analysis shows that our policy is benefitting working people and families the length and breadth of Britain. Recovering from the crash of the Labour years is a long process. There is a lot more to be done to fully repair the economy and to continue to get the financial pressure of families. 'That’s why we Liberal Democrats are committed to raising the personal allowance still further, to £12,500 over the next Parliament. 'That will deliver a further tax cut of £380 pounds to a typical basic rate tax payer and a further boost of £770 to dual income households. And this policy helps make our economy stronger and fairer in other ways too. It helps keep spending power in the economy and makes being in work pay.' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: ‘These figures underline like never before the sheer scale of the tax cuts delivered by the Liberal Democrats for working households across Britain. Many, including the Prime Minister, said it could not be done, but Danny Alexander and I have cut taxes for low and middle earners while pulling our country's economy back from the brink where it was left by Labour. And it's not over yet. 'The Liberal Democrats may have cut people's taxes by £825 but if we are in government again after 2015, we will cut them by a further £380 by raising the point at which you start paying tax to £12,500.' The Treasury figures show that 784,000 nurses and 821,000 working in school classrooms have gained the full benefit of the increase in the amount of tax-free income that can be earned. The largest number of families with children that will benefit from the personal allowance increase are from the South East at 800,000, followed by 700,000 from the North West. The analysis also shows that 2.7 million workers will be taken out of tax altogether under the Government’s increases to the personal allowance, of which 300,000 are national minimum wage workers. In total, 50 per cent of people on the minimum wage who had been previously paying income tax will be taken out of tax altogether by April.","New Treasury analysis shows who has gained from income tax cut .

There are now so many people are now reaching their 100th birthday that the little-known Whitehall office responsible for making sure their milestone is celebrated has already had to take on extra staff. Some 7,517 people have received a Centenarian card from the Palace this year, up from 6,360 in 2013. The cards are sent to British citizens on their 100th, 105th and every subsequent birthday. The Department of Work and Pensions, which is responsible for checking ages and sending birthday cards from the Queen, has increased the number of employees involved from one to seven in the past five years. The number of people over the age of 100 has risen dramatically from around 3,000 in 1983 to more than 13,700 in 1983 . Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that there are now 13,780 people over the age of 100 in Britain, compared with just 6,860 in 2000. It is now estimated one in three children born today will reach 100. Margaret Wilberforce-Eke, who leads the DWP team in charge of keeping information on centenarians up to date, said last month: 'Every day we help families mark amazing celebrations. Reaching 100 might be becoming more common, but it is still very special for all those involved. 'It is a privilege to be involved in just a small part of these birthdays – but we hear back that receiving a card is the perfect finishing touch for a great day.' The DWP Centenarian team, based in Newcastle upon Tyne, contacts people approaching their 100th, 105th and every subsequent birthday who are in receipt of State Pension. Those not in receipt of State Benefits can make a direct application to Buckingham Palace to receive a celebration card.","The assistant anniversaries officer will be paid £20,000 a year .

"A British skier has fallen hundreds of metres to his death in the French Alps. The man in his mid-30s was descending the north face of the Tour Ronde in the French Alps when it's thought he lost one of his ski's and slid down a 'couloir' - a narrow gully with a steep gradient. He was skiing down Mont Blanc - near Chamonix - with four of his friends, who immediately alerted the rescue services after the accident. Unfortunately, he had died instantly. Tragedy: The British skier was descending the north face of the Tour Ronde (pictured, file photo) when it's thought he lost one of his ski's and fell down a gully . A police spokesman said: 'He was with friends. He fell in a couloir and fell and slid a total of about 400 metres, not vertical. 'An investigation into the accident is underway.' He added: 'The conditions are dangerous. People must pay attention to the weather bulletins and the conditions.' The man's body was retrieved by helicopter. The four other skiers made their own way back to Chamonix. La Tour Ronde, located on the French-Italian border between the Col Du Geant and Mont Maudit, rises to a height of 3,792 metres. The north face is considered a difficult and dangerous descent reserved for highly experienced mountaineers. It has been a deadly season in the Alps. Also on Friday a 46-year-old French woman was killed in an avalanche in Valloire in the Savoie region. Accident: He was skiing down Mont Blanc (pictured, file photo) with four of his friends who alerted the rescue services of the accident - but he died instantly .

"The Government increasingly views Muslim organisations and individuals with 'suspicion', a former Conservative party chairman has said. Baroness Warsi, who quit as a Foreign Office minister last August, criticised what she called a policy of non-engagement with the Muslim community. The first Muslim member of the Cabinet hit out at the failure to develop a friendship with the three-million strong Muslim community in Britain. Scroll down for video . Baroness Warsi said there had been a failure to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment . Writing in The Observer, she said: 'The obsessive checking of the backgrounds of those on guest lists to Eid events, the refusal to attend events where there may 'possibly' or 'potentially' be a speaker whose views we find unsavoury, even when attendance would provide the perfect opportunity to challenge those views, has created a unique approach within government over the last four years. 'This is to view ever-increasing numbers of Muslim organisations or individual activists with suspicion and dangerously narrow engagement to a dozen people from a community of more than three million.' Baroness Warsi warned a letter sent by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles urging Muslim leaders to do more to root out extremism had backfired. The letter was condemned as 'patronising and factually incorrect' by some Muslims, with many saying it gave the idea th at Muslims and Islam are inherently apart from British society. While largely supportive of the intentions behind the letter from Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, whom she describes as a friend, Lady Warsi said the storm of criticism it provoked from some sections of the Muslim community was unsurprising. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, at an event organised by the Board of Deputies of British Jews last weekend, wrote a letter urging Muslim leaders to do more to root out extremism . She said there had been almost six years of non-engagement, both by the previous Labour Government and now the coalition. 'The reaction to the Pickles letter underlines what I consistently argued for in government - that it was important for us to engage with a broad range of groups and individuals who purported to speak for the British Muslim community, while accepting that, inevitably, some didn't do it very well,' said Lady Warsi. She said there had been a failure to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment, and described the current climate within the Muslim community as one of concern, worry and fear. 'So it's no surprise there is a trust deficit, a questioning of motive to a letter sent with the best of intentions. For too many, the hand of friendship felt like an admonitory finger that was once again pointing at Britain's Muslims,' she said. Lady Warsi also said it was sad that her calls for a meeting, similar to the annual one the Prime Minister has with the Jewish Leadership Council, with members of other major faith communities had not been answered. Sadiq Khan, Labour's shadow justice secretary, said: 'When the most senior Tory Muslim is so scathing about her own party, we should all sit up and listen. These comments confirm that David Cameron's Conservatives are out-of-touch and have nothing to offer British Muslims. Only Labour truly represents all of Britain's communities.'","Former Foreign Office minister criticised policy of non-engagement .

"The 'Blair Force One' private jet is owned by one of Britain's richest men, it was claimed today. The Bombardier Global Express used by former prime minister Tony Blair is said to be owned by Richard Caring, who made his £800million wealth in the fashion, property and restaurant industries. Mr Caring, 62, is a Labour donor who lent the party £2million ahead of Mr Blair’s third election win in 2005, and the £30million luxury jet has the ability to fly 7,000 miles and 13 hours non-stop. Scroll down for video . 'Blair Force One': The Bombardier Global Express jet has the ability to fly 7,000 miles and 13 hours non-stop . Wealthy: The plane is said to be owned by Richard Caring (pictured with his wife Jackie), of Hampstead, north-west London, who made his £800million wealth in the fashion, property and restaurant industries . The bespoke aircraft has a stateroom, lounge, kitchen and bed. It has 19 seats with a distinctive black-and-gold livery and luxurious interior, including leather seats and walnut panelling. The plane Mr Blair has been using was built in 2006, and registered with the Civil Aviation Authority two years later. Registration details list Mr Caring as its owner, reported The Sunday Telegraph. It is unclear what Mr Blair, 61, pays for use of the jet - operated and managed via International Jet Club - although the usage cost was quoted by the Mail in September 2013 as being £7,000 an hour. While in Downing Street, Mr Blair’s administration looked at plans for a jet dubbed Blair Force One - in homage to the US president’s Air Force One - but the scheme was abandoned as too expensive. Mr Blair now works in consultancy roles and charges huge fees for public speaking - but last July suggested he was worth less than £20million, following reports the figure was closer to £100million.

He works in countries as diverse as Mongolia, Kazakhstan and Rwanda, and was seen getting off the plane three times in 2013 in Bangkok, Sardinia and New York, reported the Telegraph. One aviation expert told the newspaper that the Global Express jet typically costs £800,000 to lease for a month, including costs for fuel, pilots, cabin crew and landing among other expenses. But MailOnline understands that father-of-four Mr Blair does not lease a plane on a monthly basis. A spokesman for Mr Caring was unable to confirm or deny today whether he is the owner of the jet. Mr Caring, of Hampstead, north-west London, owns exclusive Annabel’s in Mayfair - the only nightclub which can say it once had the Queen as a guest - and restaurant Le Caprice in Piccadilly. The 62-year-old, married to former model Jackie, made his fortune in the Eighties and Nineties supplying, among others, his friend Topshop boss Sir Philip Green with clothes from the Far East. Hampstead resident: Richard Caring, who is 62 and married, is worth an estimated £800million . Richard Caring, owner of the Ivy and Le Caprice restaurants in London, is nicknamed ‘the coat hanger king’ and lives in a vast Hampstead house dubbed ‘the Versailles of London’. The 62-year-old is worth an estimated £800million, and his venue Annabel’s in Mayfair is the only nightclub which can boast it once had the Queen as a guest. He made his money from flooding high street fashion chains with clothes made in the Far East, supplying, among others, his friend Topshop boss Sir Philip Green. Despite having no experience in restaurants, he then built up a collection of some of the most famous dining rooms in Britain. In 2005, he paid £31.5million for Signature Restaurants, which owned The Ivy, J Sheekey and Le Caprice. The group also operates the re-launched Scott's, as well as Daphne's, Bam-Bou and the Rivington Grill. He went on to buy Annabel's nightclub, along with Harry's Bar and Mark's Club when he bought the Birley Group for £102million.","Bombardier Global Express is owned by Richard Caring, report claims .

"Standard Liege say they will hold talks with fans after a banner was unfurled depicting the decapitated head of their former captain Steven Defour. Liege faced Anderlecht in a fierce derby on Sunday, with Defour lining up for Anderlecht having previously captained Liege in a four-year spell at the club. Fans of Liege, outraged at the actions of their former player, showed the banner pre-match but a spokesman for the club has condemned their actions. Standard Liege fans unveiled a huge banner of their former player Steven Defour's decapitated head . Defour, angry at an offside decision, launches the ball into the Standard Liege crowd at pace . 'During the pre-match show the fans had another banner,' Olivier Smeets told www.sport.be. 'There is such a thing as freedom of speech but we disagree with what we saw on Sunday afternoon. After all, we understand all too well that it is offensive to many people. So we will take away the banner that was shown. 'First, we want to have talks with the people who made this, but that does not mean no sanctions will follow.' The club are likely to receive a hefty fine for their fans' actions, too. Alongside Defour's decapitated head were the words, 'Red or Dead'. The midfielder was, of course, red during his time at Liege, but left for Porto in 2011. Defour reacts to receiving a second yellow card after he smashed the ball into the Standard Liege fans . Standard Liege's Igor de Camargo celebrates after scoring his side's second goal late on against Anderlecht . He spent two years in Portugal before heading back to Belgium, but not back to Liege, to the dismay of supporters. He joined bitter rivals Anderlecht, an act of betrayal in the eyes of Liege's staunch fans. If their banner's sole aim was to rile Defour, they got their wish. Liege won the game 2-0, and their former captain did not last the 90 minutes. With 53 minutes on the clock, Defour reacted to an offside call he didn't agree with, smashing the ball with pace into the Liege supporters. The referee had had enough, and a second yellow was brandished. Everton striker Romelu Lukaku, himself a former Anderlecht player, described the game as 'Belgium's El Clasico' on Twitter. But for Defour, it is one he'll hope can be quickly erased from the memory. The player did show remorse after the game, taking to Twitter to express his forgiveness. 'I apologise to my team-mates and fans at Anderlecht, although I do not understand the red card. You cannot see or hear the referee.'","Steven Defour spent five years at Standard Liege before joining Porto .

"Chatham Town were at the centre of a jihadi attack, after a bungling hacker targeted their club website - mistaking it for a Premier League club. The Muslim hacker, who called himself Abdellah Elmaghribi, targeted Chatham Town website on Saturday ahead of its clash with Tilbury FC - which attracted a crowd of just 63. The website was shut down for 12 hours after an image of a machine-gun wielding man wearing a gas mask was posted with a message asking: 'Where is the security?' A Muslim hacker, who called himself Abdellah Elmaghribi, posted a message on Chatham Town FC's website saying: 'I'm not Charlie. I'm not a terrorist. I am a Muslim and proud to be' Supporters of the tiny Kent club in Ryman League Division One  were left baffled by the message which also said: 'I'm not a terrorist. I am a Muslim and proud to be. 'A little respect for other religions. Allah is One.' The hacker also declared 'I am not Charlie' in reference to the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris which claimed the lives of 11 people. Bosses at the club apologised to fans, saying its website had been hacked. Steve Archer, who looks after the website for the club, said the cyber attack 'made no sense' and that the hacker was probably thinking he was 'targeting a Premier League club'. 'It makes no sense - we're a part time football club so I'm pretty sure it's just a random attack - I hope it was,' he told Kent Online. 'Someone told me about 11pm. It must have been quite late as I had been working on it that evening. The website of the small club which is in Division One North of the Isthmian League was shut down for 12 hours ahead of a clash with Tilbury FC - which attracted a crowd of just 63 . 'I'm just hoping I've not lost too much information. It's taken me two years to put it together, and I've spent a lot of time on the history section. I've got results on there going back to 1990.' The average attendance at club's home matches at The Sports Ground, a 5,000 capacity stadium in Chatham, Kent, is just 143. Chatham FC supporter John Hendry, 38, said: 'There is no way this guy would want to waste his time attacking a website that only a handful of people look at. 'He must have thought he was targeting a Premier League team or at least a Championship team - poor old Chatham must be low on the radar when it comes to cyber terrorism.' Another local, calling himself Kentishman, said: 'Today Chatham Town FC. Tomorrow the world. Mwahhahahaha. 'I bet MI5 are putting their best people on it right now. These people know how to strike at the very heart of society. The hacker, based in Morocco, has attacked websites across the globe, including Nigeria's number one music site, NotJuskOk . 'I'm inconsolable now I can't get access to the Chatham Town FC website. There's no point in carrying on.' Another, calling himself Billbo, wrote: 'Hahahahaha. Literally the worst hack I've ever seen.' The hacker, based in Morocco, has attacked websites across the globe, including Nigeria's number one music site, NotJuskOk. He is believed to be part of X-AMZ Team along with fellow hackers ViRusx.EL, Nasser Eddine, Moroccan Wolf and AlFeRox.

"There were almost 600 convictions for cruelty or neglect of horses, donkeys and ponies last year, two-and-a-half times more than in 2011, the RSPCA said. The animal welfare charity investigated almost 3,000 more complaints of animal cruelty and neglect in 2013 than in 2012, although overall convictions were down on the previous year, new figures showed. But there were 585 convictions for cruelty or neglect involving horses, donkeys and ponies last year, up from 500 in 2012 and an increase of 154 per cent on 2011's figure of 230, when the RSPCA warned of an equine crisis. There were 585 convictions for cruelty or neglect involving horses, donkeys and ponies last year . Cases included Bluey, a young mare who was found in an emaciated condition with her dead foal lying nearby, and Molly, a piebald filly who was emaciated and collapsed when she was found, but who after intensive care went on to win reserve champion in the Rescue Horse of the Year Championship at Equifest 2013. In total, there were 3,961 convictions in 2013, down from 4,168 in 2012.

Other cases investigated by the RSPCA included dogs being set on wild animals and a shar pei dog called Ruby who was kicked, punched and dragged along a pavement before she died. The RSPCA investigated 153,770 complaints of cruelty last year, an increase from 150,833 the previous year. David Bowles, the head of external affairs at the RSPCA, said: ""Whilst we are heartened that the numbers of people convicted of cruelty have decreased, the fact that we are investigating more and more complaints shows that there is still a culture of cruelty out there. ""Nothing illustrates this like the massive increase in equine-related convictions. ""This is due mainly to irresponsible owners who have let their animals breed indiscriminately, together with an economic downturn which has seen feed prices go up and horses going for just a few pounds at market. ""As a result, horses have been left to suffer without food and vet treatment."" The RSPCA rescued an increased number of horses in 2013, up from 1,275 in 2012 to 1,797 last year. The charity also rescued 17,665 dogs. Mr Bowles added that although there had been fewer convictions relating to dogs, the charity was still rescuing more and more.

"Rory McIlroy insisted his looming court battle with his ex-management company will have no bearing on his golf as he outlined a seven-point plan to rule the world once more in 2015.

Last year he took fewer strokes than anyone else but lost out to Pablo Larrazabal after picking up a daft two-shot penalty during the third round, when he failed to take full relief from ground under repair.

Rory McIlroy  (right) and caddie JP Fitzgerald (left) know all roads lead to the Masters at Augusta in April . Justin Rose (third left), Rickie Fowler (third right) and Henrik Stenson (second right) joined McIlroy . McIlroy posted a picture of himself with Ricky Fowler and the caption 'Two best bar men at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship' ‘It is a course I definitely feel comfortable on and, after the year I’ve just enjoyed in 2014, I feel like I am going into the event with momentum,’ said McIlroy. ‘It was great to take time off over Christmas and reflect on what I achieved and watch some highlights of my wins. But it’s time to move on and in practice I’ve been hitting the ball really well.’ As he does every year, McIlroy passed the time away during his first flight of the campaign from Dublin to the Middle East by writing down his goals on the back of a boarding pass. ‘There are seven written down and obviously I am not going to reveal them publicly,’ he said. ‘But I will keep the boarding pass in my wallet and then take it out at the end of the season and see whether I’ve achieved them all. ‘I didn’t manage it last year. In fact, I don’t think I’ve ever managed it. I set my goals pretty high. Last year, for example, I wrote down six wins worldwide but only managed four. It was still a good year though.’ McIlroy is hoping to go even better this year than his Open and US PGA Championship wins of 2014 . McIlroy's swing looked to be in good shape in a Facebook video he posted last week . Naturally, McIlroy was smiling broadly when he made that last tongue-in-cheek comment. He knows it is going to be exceedingly difficult to emulate a year that saw him win two majors – the Open and the USPGA Championship. But he was adamant that spending large parts of next month in a Dublin courtroom will have no bearing on trying to become just the sixth player to complete the career Grand Slam at the Masters. ‘Why should it have any bearing or be a distraction?’ said McIlroy. ‘I literally have not thought about it since I had some meetings with lawyers last November. It’s no big deal. I’m not bothered about having to stand up in court. What have I got to be worried about? I’ve just got to stand there and tell the truth. It’s no big deal. I’ll be okay at the end of the day.’ The Ulsterman looked in good spirits during his press conference in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday morning . McIlroy is both suing and being countersued by Horizon Sports, and the stakes are high. If he loses, it could cost him tens of millions of pounds. As for Augusta, McIlroy revealed he is likely to alter his schedule in the build-up. He normally likes to play the week before in Houston but is aware the hype will be off the charts by then. Accordingly, he is likely to take that week off and make the Arnold Palmer Invitational event, which takes place a fortnight earlier, his last tournament before the Masters. ‘It’s definitely a strong possibility I will play Arnie’s event but it depends how I am playing regarding Houston,’ he said. ‘If I feel I need to play some more golf then I will definitely add it to the schedule.’ As things stand, however, Plan A is to play five events before the year’s first major – starting on Thursday here in Abu Dhabi.

"A hiker was arrested and warned she could face jail after freeing an eagle from a trap and springing three more traps to protect other animals. Kathleen Adair, 39, was walking her three dogs up Davies Creek Trail in Alaska on Christmas Eve when she spotted the bird with each leg shut inside traps. She spent an hour freeing the creature before alerting a bird rescue firm. Heading home, she also sprung another trap which she spotted in the ground - prompting an investigation by Alaska Wildlife Troopers that landed her in court. Eventually tracked down by authorities she was charged and hauled to court facing a $500 fine and 30 days in jail. Arrested: Kathleen Adair, 39, was charged with hindering lawful trapping after snaring three traps in Alaska . The eagle was found and euthanized three days after she freed it. 'What we expect from the public is if they come upon an eagle in a trap, to notify us as soon as possible. That way we can go out there and see what's going on,' Alaska Wildlife Trooper Sgt Aaron Frenzel told the station. Defending her actions, Adair told the Juneau Empire she is not 'an ecoterrorist trying to ruin trappers' livelihood.' 'I grew up hunting and fishing here, I've got several animal skins on my walls,' she said. 'I don't personally trap, and I don't choose to, I don't want to, but I'm not going to stop someone else from doing it. I only object when the traps are on the trail where I think they are safety concerns.' Speaking to KTOO, she said: 'I knew at the time that the eagle didn't have a very good chance. I knew if I left it there all night, it would have had a worse chance of surviving. 'But even as it was, I could tell one of the legs was just dangling, just completely broken and I knew they wouldn't be able to fix that, but I was hoping they could at least fix the other and keep it as an educational bird.' 'I wanted to go back and tell the Raptor Center where it was. I knew that would be the best thing to do, but I also knew that it would be getting dark soon. Saved: The Bald Eagle caught in a leg-hold trap in Juneau on Christmas Eve, found and released by Adair . 'It was two miles from the road and it was all the way at the end of the road, so I knew that they wouldn't be able to get out there that day to it. 'I'm not against trapping per se. I am concerned about the traps when they're on the trail in such a way as these were,' Adair said. On Thursday, the case was dismissed by a judge who called Adair's work 'admirable'. 'Her actions in saving the eagle were laudable,' Juneau District Attorney James Scott said during Adair's arraignment on Thursday afternoon. 'She should not have to run the risk of a conviction on her record for this offense.' 'When she's hiking and she comes across an eagle in a snare, I encourage her to rescue that eagle again, and I will screen that case out as well,' the district attorney added, according to the Empire.","Kathleen Adair freed an eagle from a trap and sprung 3 more in Alaska .

"Juventus have no plans to sell Paul Pogba in the near future. The 21-year-old midfielder played a major role in helping Juve clinch their third successive scudetto last season, scoring seven goals and setting up seven more in 36 Serie A appearances for the Bianconeri. Reports claim Manchester United are preparing a £77million bid to bring the France international back to Old Trafford this summer. Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba (right) vies for possession with Napoli's Christian Maggio . When asked about Pogba, Juve general director Giuseppe Marotta told Sky Italia: 'What was a promising player has become a reality.

Pogba celebrates after he scored a sensational volley to help Juve beat Napoli 3-1 in Naples . 'We have an important player in Pogba and we don't have a need to sell him.' Pogba, who joined Juve from United on a free transfer in 2012, is also a reported target of Chelsea and Manchester City. The Frenchman recently signed a contract extension with the Turin giants until June 2019. 'Is Pogba's price tag around €80million (£66million)?

"A Peruvian footballer is reported to be recovering in hospital after being struck by lightning during a national cup semi-final. Joao Contreras Fuentes, a player from the Sport Aguila club, was preparing for the start of the second half in a Copa Peru tie with Fuerza Minera when he was hit by a bolt and instantly collapsed. The 21-year-old was surrounded by alarmed players and carried off the pitch and taken by ambulance to hospital. A puff of smoke emerges from Joao Contreras after he is struck by lightning during the match . An assistant referee, Abraham Loayza Morales, was also hurt in the incident at the Mariscal Castilla stadium in Lima. Sport Aguila captain Amilcar Lobon told the newspaper Diario Correo his team-mate's condition was improving. 'Thank God he's okay, he's getting better, and now we're just thinking about his recovery,' Lobon said. 'It's difficult to imagine this situation that just doesn't happen in Huancayo. 'As I reiterate, the important thing is that our friend Joao is out of danger.' Panicked players and staff rush to offer their assistance after the incident in the Copa Peru game . Players gather around the Sport Aguila player after he hits the ground, along with an assistant referee . The horrifying incident sparked media speculation in Peru that Contreras had died, leading to an angry reaction from the Peruvian Football Federation (FPF). It said in a statement on its website: 'Unfortunately the force of nature has caused a serious impact to the health of one of the Sport Aguila players and one of the refereeing team. 'We regret that some media have released definitive news about the death of the Sport Aguila player, without having checked the news and in clear violation of the fundamental rules of prudence, since the player and the referee have family and therefore deserve respect.'","Joao Contreras Fuentes collapsed after being struck by lightning while playing in the Copa Peru semi-final .

"Arsene Wenger applauded his team for responding to their defensive disaster at Southampton on New Year's Day with their first clean sheet in eight games. Wenger called it 'a serious performance' as the FA Cup holders beat Hull 2-0 in the third round, and hailed Francis Coquelin as one of the positive factors to emerge from the crowded festive fixture programme. The Arsenal manager also stressed that none of the Barclays Premier League teams who played back-to-back away games on December 28th and January 1 were able to take six points on the road. Arsene Wenger applauds his players after the opening goal on Sunday evening in north London . Per Mertesacker wheels away in celebration after scoring for Arsenal in the first half of the FA Cup clash . 'We suffered at Southampton at the back as a unit and it was not a great performance,' said Wenger. 'I have analysed this period and none of those teams who played away from home on the 28th and the first have won both games. We were very disappointed at Southampton but nobody won the two games. 'We have had three away games out of four (at Liverpool, West Ham and Southampton) and took four points, more than anybody else.' On Coquelin, who has returned to the team to deputise for injured midfielders Mikel Arteta and Mathieu Flamini, the Arsenal boss added: 'For me, he has left a positive impression. He has done well, matured a lot and is strong in the fight.' Chile forward Sanchez was again Arsenal's stand-out player, sweeping home a 16th goal of the season. 'He is lively and always dangerous,' said Wenger of the £32million summer signing from Barcelona. 'Alexis has a change of direction, is incisive and penetrating, and has also a good fighting spirit.He has a good combination of what you want to see from top players - that means being ready for a fight and talent.' Alexis Sanchez doubles their lead late in the second half after turning Curtis Davies on the edge of the box . The Chilean forward tweeted a picture of himself taking a bath after his man-of-the-match performance . Wenger admitted he was 'tempted' to rest Sanchez. He added: 'You look at the players who have that confidence and you are torn between when a player is that confident to keep him on playing or give him a rest. 'But when the players are confident it is important to keep them going, especially when they have that physical potential. 'Sanchez recovers very quickly and he doesn't look in our tests to have any fatigue problem.' Wenger was glad Walcott came through his first real test after recovering from an injury which shattered his World Cup dream. 'Theo looked dangerous. You could see he hasn't lost the quality of his runs,' said Wenger. 'He lacks a bit of competition, but that will come. What he has done tonight after being out for a year is quite positive.' Theo Walcott was handed his first start of the season in Arsenal's 2-0 win against Hull in the FA Cup . Walcott revealed he was delighted to finally play with Sanchez and hopes for more appearances with him . Wenger confirmed the imminent departure of German forward Lukas Podolski, saying only: 'He is going to Inter Milan.' France under-21 forward Yaya Sanogo could be another allowed to leave during the January window, preferentially to another club in England, with Bordeaux reported to be interested. 'Podolski was frustrated because he didn't get chance to play, I can understand, but Sanogo is more in search for experience at the top level in the Premier League. If he can get that, we will see,' he said. 'Sanogo is ready to play, but I have so many options up front it is difficult for him to play. Hull manager Steve Bruce had few complaints at the final outcome. 'It is a fair result,' he said. 'We huffed and puffed, but didn't have any cutting edge to make the cup tie come alive. 'We had decent possession, but didn't really create any chances in the final third which is disappointing.' Hull City manager Steve Bruce looks on during his side's match with Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium . Bruce added: 'We made 10 changes with all the injuries we have got, and that wasn't a case of disrespecting the cup because we had one of the best days of our lives in the competition last year. 'It was always going to be difficult once we picked them out of the hat.' Hull are in need of reinforcements during January, but Bruce played down suggestions former England striker Jermain Defoe was on his way. 'He might be too expensive. If there is a chance we would be interested in him, but I don't want to get the hopes up of all the Hull supporters. There is a long way to go,' Bruce said.","Arsenal beat Hull City 2-0 in their FA Cup clash at the Emirates Stadium .

"If you're a little squeamish you may not want to watch the video accompanying this column. It features the most persistently savage treatment I have ever seen a footballer receive on a pitch. You may hear more of the name Harry Beautyman in the future, but only sheer luck has allowed him to get a move into the Football League and a step up to League One level as he chases his dream of making it in the professional game. Harry Beautyman has joined League One Peterborough on loan from Conference side Welling United . Beautyman (No 8) goes in for a tackle with Halifax's Matty Pearson at Park View Road . England C international Pearson goes studs-up on the talented 22-year-old but doesn't get booked . The 22-year-old technically gifted talent was rejected by Leyton Orient and has had to make his way through non-League football to earn another shot at the big time. On Monday he made a loan switch from Welling to League One Peterborough United, with the deal set to be made permanent when the transfer window opens in January. He's a lucky boy – not because he's getting a shot in the League, his performances have earned him that chance with 45 goals in 130 Conference games from midfield. He's lucky because he was sliced to pieces by brutal, Neanderthal players in Saturday's Conference game, which Welling won 2-1 against Halifax. When you see the succession of vicious challenges aimed at Beautyman you wonder how he survived without breaking any limbs. In almost 40 years of watching football at all levels of the game I have never seen a player receive such horrendous treatment. Maybe I am naive, but I didn't think this sort of nasty thuggery still happened on the pitch. Beautyman, pictured in his post-match interview, was fortunate to finish the game without a serious injury . Halifax's Scott McManus (second from right) launches himself at Beautyman by the corner flag . McManus misses the ball and smashes into the Welling midfielder during the second half . Beautyman, who has now joined Peterborough United on loan, is sent flying by McManus' challenge . Halifax No 5 Matty Pearson, who was eventually red carded for stamping on Beautyman, actually played for England C – the non-League international side - last month in Turkey. Will the Football Association do anything about his behaviour? He committed most of the fouls shown in the video, which was put together by www.footballcameraman.uk. Pearson's main aim is clearly to take Beautyman out, he has very little interest in the ball. It's disgusting to watch. The first one sees Pearson's studs aimed at Beautyman's knees. Incredibly the referee didn't even give him a yellow card. The foul by the corner flag – the third foul on the video - is sickening. A delicious piece of skill sees Beautyman, flying down the right wing, drag the ball back while at full pace. But the defender, Scott McManus, is already sliding in and recklessly takes out Beautyman's standing leg. It's amazing he doesn't break his leg. McManus, who was convicted of assaulting his girlfriend three years ago - hours after being sent off in an FA Cup tie for violent conduct - appears to lean over the victim as he lies on the ground and say something to him. It's clearly not a question about whether he is feeling OK. Beautyman is wrestled to the turf in another exchange with Halifax midfielder Pearson . Pearson earned a deserved red card after stamping out at talented 22-year-old Beautyman . McManus tweeted after the game that he thought it was a fair challenge, and he defended his view by pointing out that the referee didn't even award a free-kick. But for me McManus has no control over his body as he flies full force into Beautyman. He shows no care towards his fellow player. I think it's a horrible challenge, a potential leg-breaker, and the referee got it badly wrong. But you take a look and decide. Remarkably Beautyman ends up being booked by clueless referee Adam Bromley for having his own shirt pulled. I cannot believe this happened this weekend in the fifth tier of English football. Halifax Town, the referee, and in particular Halifax's England C international Pearson should all face consequences for what happened to Beautyman. Good luck to him in his career, if there is any football justice, his skills will be rewarded with success, not injuries. As for Halifax, shame on the Shaymen. They were called 'brave' after their narrow FA Cup defeat to Bradford earlier this month. I only saw cowards in Halfiax Town shirts at Welling at the weekend.

"Brazilian superstar Neymar made sure he enjoyed a white Christmas by dying his beard for the festive season. The Barcelona forward showed off his new look when he played in a charity match in Brazil on Boxing Day. And his beard wasn't the only thing catching the eye, as Neymar also comically drove a cart around the pitch... to tend to the 'injured' Robinho. Neymar poses for the cameras ahead of the charity match held on Boxing Day . The Brazil and Barcelona forward posted a video and pictures on Instagram .

The game had only been playing five minutes when the 22-year-old collected a shot that had rebounded off the post before 'rainbow flicking' the ball over a bemused defender's header, performing a little pirouette and bursting through to chip the keeper. And just to show that blondes do indeed have more fun, Neymar joined some friends for a seasonal sing-song and posted the video on Instagram.","Barcelona star Neymar has dyed his beard blonde .

"Middlesbrough's on-loan FA Cup hero Patrick Bamford can see plenty of his Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho in his current manager Aitor Karanka. Bamford, 21, is enjoying a superb campaign on Teesside, having moved from Stamford Bridge on a season-long deal. The move was given the full blessing of Mourinho, who had Karanka as his assistant during his time in charge at Real Madrid. Middlesbrough striker Patrick Bamford celebrates after scoring for his side against Manchester City . Middlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka (right) watches on during the match at Manchester City . Karanka is now making an impact at the Riverside Stadium, with his Boro side second in the Sky Bet Championship and through to the FA Cup fifth round after a stunning 2-0 win at Manchester City. England Under-21 international Bamford set Boro on the way to that famous victory at the Etihad Stadium with the opening goal and was asked afterwards if Karanka's methods compared to Mourinho's. 'Yes, definitely,' he said. 'Training is very similar and the big thing is the desire to win. You could see that on Saturday - the passion, every detail is in there. Jose Mourinho talks with his former assistant Karanka during their time together at Real Madrid . 'He doesn't miss out a thing and he is very rigorous with his approach to every single game, whether it is Manchester City or whoever else we might play. 'Even if it was a lower-league team in the cup, it would be the same approach. It is all about winning.' Asked if Karanka could then be considered a 'mini Mourinho', Bamford said: 'Yes, I think he is getting there!' Bamford was highly impressive as Boro took charge of the game in the second half. Middlesbrough forward Bamford raced through before opening the scoring for the Championship side . The first period had remarkably ended goalless after City spurned a number of chances, although most of them were brilliantly saved by goalkeeper Tomas Mejias. Bamford's 53rd-minute strike, as Boro pounced on a defensive mix-up, changed the game and Lee Tomlin went close to a second by hitting the post soon after. Frank Lampard did hit the woodwork late on for City but Kike, made victory certain for the visitors in stoppage time. Bamford, who has now scored 10 goals this season, hopes his continued good form will eventually result in greater opportunities at Stamford Bridge. Karanka celebrates with Grant Leadbitter after knocking Manchester City out of the FA Cup . Karanka and Mourinho share a joke during their time working together out at Real Madrid . With that in mind, he feels it can only be beneficial that Karanka and Mourinho have such a good relationship. Bamford said: 'They are always in touch and whenever he speaks the gaffer always says he's had a little chat with him and always makes a joke about it, so it is nice to know that I am in his thoughts. 'I've played against three Premier League teams now - Sunderland, Liverpool and Man City - and I have scored against all of them. 'I think it has shown that I can cut it at the top level, but we'll see what happens. 'I'd say this season is probably too early and I'm out on loan and that is helping me, but next season you never know.' Middlesbrough players celebrate with their travelling supporters after full-time at the Etihad Stadium . Bamford began his career at Nottingham Forest but moved to Chelsea in 2012 and has since had loan spells at MK Dons and Derby. His eight goals for Derby last term helped the Rams into the Championship play-offs, but he regards his display this weekend as his career highlight to date. He said: 'I can't really put it into words the feeling when I scored the first and especially when we scored the second, even though it wasn't me that scored it... just the relief. 'To win against the champions of England has to be the best result of my career so far and one that all the lads will enjoy. 'It's particularly pleasing being a Chelsea player - so hopefully Chelsea will hear about that!'","21-year-old is at Middlesbrough on a season-long loan from Chelsea .

"It's a huge weight off Scott Mitchell's shoulders - or, to be more accurate, off his formerly swollen midsection, which until not long ago helped him tip the scales at 26-stone. That's nine-stone more than during Mitchell's dozen seasons in the NFL, where he played for the Miami Dolphins, Detroit Lions, Cincinnati Bengals and Baltimore Ravens. On Thursday's edition of 'The Biggest Loser', Mitchell reveals his current physique - just 17-stone on his 6ft 6in frame. Scott Mitchell while playing for the Miami Dolphins against the Kansas City Chiefs in 1993 . Mitchell has spent the last 15 weeks on reality television show The Biggest Loser (NBC) In addition, he'll be sporting a whole new look on this special makeover episode, as fashion expert Tim Gunn and celebrity hair stylist Ken Paves transform Mitchell. All that, plus Mitchell will be reunited with his family after 15 grueling, sequestered weeks of training. 'I get a new wardrobe, and they even cut my hair,' Mitchell said Wednesday in a phone interview. 'I look pretty darn good.' That's a self-appraisal the 47-year-old Mitchell wouldn't have voiced a few months ago. 'I really struggled with my weight during my playing career,' he recalled, having routinely gained 15 to 20 pounds each off-season that he had to lose before each season began. 'When I retired in 2001, there were no more football seasons to get ready for. I had worked out because of my job, and after retiring I kind of resented exercise because of that. So I just slowly put on weight.' By the time 'The Biggest Loser' came calling, Mitchell had reconciled himself to being fat the rest of his life. Mitchell weighed 366 pounds (26-stone) before joining the NBC television programme to lose weight . Mitchell pictured on the programme with bowls of fatty foods in front of him . But how long would that life be? By then he was in precarious health, he said - a borderline diabetic suffering from sleep apnoea and high blood pressure . Even so, he agreed to take the 'Biggest Loser' challenge filled with dread. Besides the physical demands he knew lay ahead, he was living with shame he neither wanted to confront nor share with an audience of millions. 'You have no idea how terrified I was,' he said. 'Pro athletes don't have emotional issues - or aren't supposed to. You can't show any kind of weakness. There's no crying in football.' Along with the exercise and nutritional regimen, he tangled with emotional issues he had long held at bay. 'Once I got there, they said, `You're gonna lose weight, but you'll gain it all back unless you figure out why you gained it in the first place.' Mitchell (second from the right) with the other contestants on the television show . Quarterback Mitchell while playing for the Detroit Lions in 1997 (left) and 1998 (right) And, yes, he cried. In particular, he recalled a morning hike when 'I just lost it - I sat down on the trail and sobbed uncontrollably, about how in my life I was focusing on the things that brought me pain and sorrow, and how that was a big part of why I gained weight.

"Sam Allardyce admitted he was relieved after West Ham beat Bristol City 1-0 to avoid joining the list of big-name FA Cup fourth-round casualties. Substitute Diafra Sakho broke City hearts with an 81st-minute winner, rising at the far post to beat goalkeeper Frank Fielding after Andy Carroll had done well to cross from the right. The outcome was harsh on the League One high-flyers and Allardyce admitted: 'I expected us to play a lot better than we did.

'In the end one moment of quality has put us in the next round and that is the most important thing. All credit to Bristol City for never being overawed and taking their league form, which has been outstanding, into the FA Cup. 'Keeping a clean sheet made all the difference and it was a hard-earned victory for us. They had their best spell in the opening 15 or 20 minutes, but we battled all the way through to make that one bit of quality count. 'With the size Bristol have in their team, we knew we had to protect ourselves as best we could from set-pieces.

The Senegalese striker meets Andy Carroll's cross at the far post to send the away side into the fifth round . 'How far we can go in the competition will depend on the draw. We will have to face Premier League opposition at some point if we progress, but I would rather leave that until the final!' City looked the more threatening side for most of a lively first half and it took two goalline clearances to keep the Hammers on level terms. Mark Noble was on hand to block Matt Smith's fifth-minute header after Aden Flint's power in the air at a corner had set up the chance. And Carroll did even better to divert another Smith header over his own crossbar on 26 minutes, leaving the big City striker holding his head in disbelief after he had connected with a Jay Emmanuel-Thomas cross. It took West Ham until the 37th minute to force a save from Fielding. Then Carroll's close-range shot was straight at the City keeper from a Carl Jenkinson cross. By early in the second period Allardyce had seen enough, sending on Sakho and Morgan Amalfitano for Enner Valencia and the out-of-sorts Alex Song.

Out of action since suffering a back injury on New Year's Day, the striker grazed the crossbar with a brilliant effort shortly before his goal. But even after the deadlock had been broken, Smith almost earned City a replay with an injury-time header that went inches wide and home boss Steve Cotterill was proud of his side's efforts. He said: 'We have lost to a strong team and a very good club. Sam has done a fantastic job at West Ham and I sincerely hope they now go on to win the competition. 'We are disappointed because we worked hard in the build-up to the game. We needed to score when on top in the first half and had some good chances. 'If I am ultra-critical of my players, I think we could have done better in the second half. But overall I think we showed a national TV audience that we are a decent team. 'Sakho made a difference and was lively from the moment he came on. We can't hope to have that sort of quality on the bench as a League One club. 'We have a big game here on Thursday in the area final of the Johnstone's Paint Trophy and what has so far been a successful league campaign (is set to) continue so there is a lot to look forward to.'

"Nicky Henderson believes Sprinter Sacre’s comeback second behind Dodging Bullets at Ascot on Saturday has left the gelding with a ‘realistic’ chance of winning back his Queen Mother Champion Chase crown at the Cheltenham Festival on March 11. The Lambourn trainer, who felt the exacting pace in the Clarence House Chase set by eventual fourth Somersby ultimately took its toll on a gelding racing for the first time in 13 months, also insists he is not unduly concerned by the ‘low level bleed’ detected from the nine-year-old’s nostrils under veterinary examination while being routinely tested in the immediate aftermath of the race. Henderson said: ‘We could do without it but it is something we can live with. If you looked at him this morning you would not see anything or know it had happened. Sprinter Sacre recuperated from a heart problem to make comeback at Ascot on Saturday . ‘There was no mucus, which was important.’ Sprinter Sacre, who has recuperated from a heart problem, now heads straight to the Festival as 3-1 joint favourite for the Champion Chase with sponsors Betway, bracketed with recuperating reigning champion Sire De Grugy who is due to make his return to action in the Game Spirit Chase at Newbury on February 7. Henderson added: ‘If you look at the time of the race it confirms AP (McCoy on Somersby) went a really good gallop. There was no hiding place and no chance of having a breather even for a few strides. Nicky Henderson is confident Sprinter Sacre has nearly fully recovered from heart problem . ‘There was that moment turning in when you just thought a miracle was going to happen but his legs turned to jelly. He's had a fairly intense build-up, which is why he was more than 80 per cent fit. He was probably nearer 90 per cent. I think it's realistic for him to regain his crown at Cheltenham.’ Meanwhile, Henderson’s 2011 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Long Run has been ruled out for the season after injuries sustained in the spring. Trainer Willie Mullins blamed a ‘little muscle problem’ for the defeat of Vautour at Christmas as the Supreme Novices’ Hurdle winner got back on the successful chasing trail with a bloodless victory at Leopardstown.

"Harlequins stuck to their side of the deal but were left to rue results elsewhere as they crashed out of Europe. Under heavy snowfall in southern France, Conor O’Shea and his coaching staff watched on a laptop as Leinster’s failure to beat Wasps in Coventry brought a painful end to their Champions Cup hopes. The seven tries to three scoreline will send the club’s England contingent — Joe Marler, Chris Robshaw, Nick Easter, Danny Care and Mike Brown — to Pennyhill Park in bittersweet spirits, as the west London side finished third in Pool 2.

Harlequins flancker Nick Easter passes the ball during the European Champions Cup match against Castres . ‘We did what we needed to do and unfortunately we couldn’t control anything else,’ said O’Shea. ‘Towards the end we were watching on the laptop and seeing Leinster miss drop goals and penalties. Ian Madigan is an 80-90 per cent kicker and I think he kicked three from seven. We could only control what we could control. ‘You can’t rely on others and that’s the position we left ourselves in. I thought we played pretty well in tough conditions.’ Just 6,802 turned out in the freezing conditions but Castres delivered a typically partisan reaction when Marler went over for the opening try in the 12th minute. Quins were sniffing for the four-try bonus point and, after turning down a kick at goal, Nick Evans kicked for the corner. A serious looking knee injury meant Will Collier was withdrawn from action, however the travelling pack pulled together and Marler was on hand to finish a driving maul from the line-out. Charlie Walker and Brown were reading from different hymn sheets when a misplaced pass almost gifted Castres a try, shortly before scrum-half Antoine Dupont dived over to level.

"Wales prop Adam Jones has announced his retirement from international rugby - just five days after being left out of Warren Gatland's squad for this season's RBS 6 Nations Championship. Jones, a triple Grand Slam winner who played in 95 Tests for Wales and five as a British and Irish Lion, has called time on his Test career at the age of 33. He was also overlooked by Wales head coach Gatland for the autumn internationals earlier this season. Wales' British and Irish Lions prop Adam Jones had decided to call time on his international career . The 33-year-old in action during a British and Irish Lions training session in June 2013 . Scarlets forward Samson Lee, 11 years Jones' junior, has established himself as Wales' first-choice tighthead, with Aaron Jarvis and Scott Andrews also named among a 34-man Six Nations party. Before the squad was announced, Jones had been strongly backed to earn a recall, especially when Scarlets forward Rhodri Jones was ruled out of the entire Six Nations tournament due to a shoulder injury. Speaking last Tuesday, Gatland said: 'At the moment, Samson is our number one tighthead and we have been very impressed with his progress. 'We know exactly what Adam can and can't do, and things that he is still working on. 'I don't think he is the sort of player that you pick on the bench and ask to make an impact. He is a starting number three. 'I know that he is working hard and the door is definitely not closed. When we name a larger squad of 45 in the summer to start preparing for the World Cup, he has got a big chance of being part of that.' Cardiff Blues forward Jones, though, said he that he made up his mind before Christmas that he would step down from the international scene if he failed to make the Six Nations cut. 'I was gutted to miss out on the autumn,' Jones told the Sunday Times. 'I told myself then that I would train as hard as I can and get as fit as I can. If it didn't happen, then I'll call it a day.' Jones (right) and Gethin Jenkins (left) celebrate Six Nations success . He added: 'It's obviously not the way I would want to finish, it's not how I planned it in my head, and I hope no-one thinks I am simply quitting.' Jones pointed to the disappointments of being dropped for the match against Scotland at the end of last year's Six Nations, and his '30-minute match' in South Africa in the summer, when he was replaced by Samson Lee after half an hour. That 38-16 first Test defeat against South Africa in Durban last summer has transpired to be Jones' 95th and final game for his country. He is, though, set to continue playing for the Blues. Jones was part of the side that secured a European Challenge Cup quarter-final place on Saturday by defeating Grenoble 28-3 in France. Jones, meanwhile, said he had no issue with Gatland, beyond believing he still should be in the Wales squad. 'Warren is the man who came in and saved me, he gave me a kick up the (backside), so he has been a massive influence on me, and I'm very grateful,' Jones added. 'I don't agree with what he's done now, I don't agree with him not picking me. But he's got to pick who he thinks is best.'","Adam Jones has retired from international rugby .

"Stuart Lancaster's worst fears looked to be coming true on Saturday night as two more England stars emerged as Six Nations injury doubts. Northampton flanker Tom Wood, a regular on England’s blindside of the scrum under Lancaster, hobbled off the field early in the second half of his side’s defeat by Racing Metro. And Leicester lock Geoff Parling also limped from the field in his side’s clash with Ulster. Both men will be assessed today but with a raft of players already sidelined, Lancaster can ill afford to lose two key men ahead of his side’s clash with Wales on February 6. Northampton flanker Tom Wood hobbled off the field in the second-half of his side’s defeat by Racing Metro . ‘Tom has twisted his ankle,’ said Saints boss Jim Mallinder said. ‘Hopefully it’s no more serious than that. He was certainly sore and it was the sensible thing to bring him off.’ Parling, who missed the autumn internationals with concussion, is in contention to start in England’s second row after Joe Launchbury (neck) and Courtney Lawes (ankle) both underwent surgery in recent weeks which has ruled them out of all, or most, of the Six Nations. But he is now a doubt for the Millennium Stadium clash himself, with his uncapped Leicester team-mate Graham Kitchener increasingly likely to feature in some capacity in Cardiff. England head coach Stuart Lancaster (centre) has a growing injury list ahead of the Six Nations next month . Leicester lock Geoff Parling also limped from the field in his side’s clash with Ulster on Saturday . First-choice No 8 Ben Morgan has been ruled out for at least six months after suffering a broken leg a fortnight ago, while there are serious concerns about Manu Tuilagi’s fitness after it emerged he is suffering a chronic groin condition. Tuilagi is undergoing regular injections into his pubic bone in an attempt to cure the problem — believed to the notorious condition known as Gilmore’s groin — and admits he does not know when he will return. There are also concerns over captain Chris Robshaw’s shoulder, which may yet need an operation before the World Cup. England’s autumn series was blighted by injury and Lancaster has never been able to select from a fully fit team since taking over three years ago.

"Andy Goode was a picture of anguish at the Ricoh Arena as his last-gasp shot to cap a courageous Wasps fightback flew wide of the posts but this dramatic draw may yet be enough for a quarter-final place. At half-time yesterday, the home side had appeared down and out; destined to lose this Pool Two decider and fall short in their quest to qualify for the last eight of the inaugural European Champions Cup. They were 20-6 adrift at that stage and barely had a toe-hold in the game as Leinster carved them open with alarming ease. But by the end, the tables had been turned in emphatic fashion. Dai Young’s men claimed 14 unanswered points after the break with two converted tries and they so nearly snatched a memorable victory. Wasps Andy Goode attempts a last minute drop-goal that would have brought the hosts victory . Wasps ended up drawing 20-20 with Leinster after Goode missed a last second opportunity . Goode reaacts after missing the late chance that allowed Leinster to progress to the quarter-finals . In the last minute, Wasps pounded on and on into opposition territory and once they had breached the Irish visitors’ 22, Goode set himself for the high-stakes drop goal. If he had hit the target, his club would have gone through as pool winners. Instead, the veteran fly-half’s kick missed to the right and he was left crouched and desolate. Yet, Wasps’ stirring rearguard action — in response to a calamitous first half — could see them qualify among the leading runners-up. Their fate is in the hands of other English teams today, namely Bath and Saracens. If the latter win or claim two bonus points in defeat at Clermont Auvergne, James Haskell and Co are likely to miss the cut, but if last year’s finalists are limited to one point, or none at all, Wasps can reach the knock-out phase, where they would face a daunting away tie. At least they are in contention, which seemed a far-fetched notion for so long yesterday. Dave Kearney was forced off after suffering a shoulder injury in the opening minutes of the game . Leinster's Luke Fitzgerald (centre) breaks through as the visitors take control of the game . Ashley Johnson of Wasps (left) tangles with Richardt Strauss of Leinster during the Champions Cup game . After another impressive personal contribution, Haskell — the home captain — said: ‘I’m disappointed and frustrated because I feel we should have had that. ‘We didn’t get it right in the first half but when we came in for half-time we realised we had to step it up and we won the second-half battle.’ Asked if he would be watching Bath — who host Glasgow at The Rec — and Saracens with interest, he added: ‘I won’t watch any rugby tomorrow. I’ll just let it all unfold. What happens, happens. ‘We should be good enough not to have to rely on other people. We’ve showed again that we play well with our backs to the wall, but I know we are good enough to do it from the start.’ Wasps were all at sea in the first half, after flanker Ashley Johnson was sin-binned from the kick-off, for colliding with the airborne Dave Kearney. The Leinster wing was forced to go off injured moments later and his head coach, Matt O’Connor, cast doubt on the sanction for the offence.

The visitors, with Ian Madigan running amok in midfield — to atone in part for his persistent goal- kicking lapses — sent Fergus McFadden over in the right corner early on and Isaac Boss touched down just before the break. But Wasps rallied strongly in the second half and their driving maul yielded two tries in the left corner, from attacking penalties. The home pack forced England prop Matt Mullan over the line in the 62nd minute and, seven minutes later, Nathan Hughes lunged to score from close range. Goode landed the wide conversion at the second attempt to level the match, after Leinster players had rushed out too soon, but their pressure on the Wasps No10 at the end paid off, sending the Irish side into the quarter-finals as pool winners.

"Ian Bell hit an imperious century to become England's highest one-day international run-scorer and leave Australia with a chase of 304 at the Bellerive Oval. Bell made 141 in 125 balls at the head of the innings, making another eloquent case for the role of authentic batsmanship in the 50-over format. His was a typically classy effort, peppered with crisp drives and exquisite placement, and took him past Paul Collingwood's previous English record of 5,092 runs. Ian Bell hit a century against Australia to move past Paul Collingwood's previous record of 5,092 runs . Warwickshire-born Bell is only the second Englishman to surpass 5,000 ODI runs for his country . But although England's 303 for eight was a good riposte having been asked to bat first, a return of 59 for five in the last 10 overs was an underwhelming end to proceedings. While Bell and Joe Root (69) can reflect on a job well done, captain Eoin Morgan is having a tougher time. Less then 24 hours after the revelation of a lurid blackmail plot against him, England's new captain was snared for a golden duck. Bell's form on tour has been largely excellent, with 187 in a warm-up match against the Prime Minister's XI and an effortless 88 not out in victory over India.

And history almost repeated itself as he failed to control Mitchell Starc's opening delivery and was fortunate his mis-hit did not go to hands. After that he unloaded a series of early boundaries, including three in Starc's second over as he became just the second Englishman to reach 5,000 ODI runs. The Warwickshire man even managed to draw some reluctant applause from the locals with an effortless back-foot drive for four. Moeen Ali was a virtual passenger in the opening exchanges but exploded to life in the ninth over with three consecutive sixes off Pat Cummins. The first crept over the mid-wicket rope, the second cleared it comfortably and the third was carried over the line by long-leg fielder Shaun Marsh as he attempted to hang on to a near-impossible catch. Having been 39 for four at the 10-over mark in Sydney, England were now 69 without loss. The end of fielding restrictions stemmed the flow of boundaries but Bell's intuitive ability to locate gaps ensured the hundred stand came at better than a run per ball. Ali fell for a hit-and-miss 46, deceived by James Faulkner after stepping down the track, while James Taylor lasted 14 awkward balls before lofting Moises Henriques to mid-off. Bell's century helped England to leave Australia with a chase of 304 after batting first . Bell's only life came on 80, Brad Haddin grassing a thick edge off Faulkner, and he quickly reeled in Collingwood's record and his own hundred. His latest partner, Root, was scoring busily at the other end and the pair went on to add 121 for the third wicket. Bell managed a first six with nine overs to go, Cummins again going all the way, but had run out of steam by the time he lofted Gurinder Sandhu to Starc at mid-off. Morgan was next in and failed to banish his recent troubles by nicking his first ball from Sandhu. England never regained their momentum, Root unable to last the course and Ravi Bopara bowled round his legs, while Jos Buttler and Chris Woakes were run out from the last two balls of the innings.

"England captain Eoin Morgan insists his involvement in a lurid blackmail plot has not distracted him from the job at hand, despite being dismissed first ball in the Tri-Series defeat to Australia. The England and Wales Cricket Board on Thursday lifted the lid on an Australian resident's attempt to use details of a brief relationship from Morgan's past to raise a five-figure pay-off - reportedly £35,000 - from the organisation. The ECB said it received an email from an Australian man demanding the money to prevent him revealing details regarding a relationship Morgan had with a woman five years ago to newspapers in the UK and Australia.

He contacted a Melbourne newspaper admitting he was the man involved and saying he was in possession of 'sexually based' messages exchanged between his partner and the 28-year-old. Although the issue created headlines in England and Australia, the ECB plan no more action against the man involved 'at this stage'.

"West Ham eased to a 3-0 home win over Hull City on Sunday afternoon courtesy of second-half goals from Andy Carroll, Morgan Amalfitano and Stewart Downing. ADAM SHERGOLD provides an assessment of each player involved at Upton Park. WEST HAM UNITED . Adrian - The Spanish goalkeeper had been West Ham's penalty-taking hero in the FA Cup last week but this was a far more mundane afternoon. Didn't have too many saves to make, even during the first-half which was dominated by Hull. Showed some weaknesses - a loose clearance on 13 minutes was seized upon by David Meyler and he spilt a cross shortly before the break. 6 . Adrian collides with Hull's David Meyler during the first-half at Upton Park . Carl Jenkinson - was able to stride confidently forward more and more as the match wore on as Hull retreated into their shell. Jenkinson completed his defensive and offensive duties well and never looked hurried, with the exception of a late cross that spooned into the stand. 6.5 . James Collins - solid performance at the heart of the defence until he hobbled off with an injury early in the second-half. He bailed out the overwhelmed Tomkins when Sone Aluko was bearing down on goal after 23 minutes, coming across to clear for a corner. Collins was also more than willing to play a long ball in the direction of target man Andy Carroll. 6 . West Ham defender James Collins clears the ball ahead of Hull's James Chester, injured in the process . James Tomkins - looked as though he was in for a torrid afternoon when Hull striker Sone Aluko tricked his way past him three times in the opening 25 minutes. The worst one saw Collins have to rush across and clear. But once Tomkins found his composure, and Hull's challenge faded, he was fine. Might have scored when he headed over Noble's swerving corner on 12 minutes. 5.5 . James Tomkins struggled to get to grips with Hull forward Sone Aluko during the early stages of the game . Aaron Cresswell - like Jenkinson, was given plenty of scope to push further forward as Hull's challenge dropped off after half-time. He wasn't shy in supporting the wingers, delivering crosses or even shooting for goal, as shown by a sixth-minute strike that bounced narrowly wide of the mark. 6.5 . Alex Song - As usual, his work rate was exemplary from the outset, always gravitating into space to attract a pass. Did play some loose balls as Hull's midfield seized control in the first-half but helped swing the balance back the other way after half-time. This was shown by the short burst and magnificent through pass that allowed Stewart Downing to race clear and score the third goal. 7.5 . Alex Song wins an aerial duel ahead of Hull's Jake Livermore during the opening period . Mark Noble - struggled to get a stranglehold on the midfield battle initially and his frustrations were shown by a 20th-minute yellow card for a late follow-through tackle on Tom Huddlestone after he'd given the ball away. Helped enforce and sustain West Ham's superiority after the break until replaced by Morgan Amalfitano on 65 minutes. 6 . Kevin Nolan (c) - again, helped haul West Ham's midfield on top as the match wore on and Hull's attacking instinct was blunted. A tough chance came to him early in the second-half after Stewart Downing crossed and he couldn't keep his shot down. Struck the crossbar from an almost impossible angle five minutes from time as West Ham looked for added gloss on the scoreline. 7 . Kevin Nolan just reaches the ball ahead of Hull's Tom Huddlestone during the Premier League clash . Stewart Downing - West Ham's stand-out performer on the day, Downing grew into the game and was a constant threat out wide with his dribbles and crossing. His performance was capped with a serene left-foot finish for the third goal after Alex Song's exemplary through ball set him into the clear on 71 minutes. 7.5 . Andy Carroll - A nuisance to the Hull back-line throughout, initially with his hold-ups and knock-downs to Enner Valencia which were important in the first-half as Hull were the better side. Once he had poached his goal on 48 minutes, getting in front of Curtis Davies to anticipate Allan McGregor spilling the ball from Valencia's shot, the game changed in West Ham's favour. 7 . Andy Carroll celebrates with Enner Valencia after putting West Ham ahead early in the second-half . Andy Carroll uses his strength to manoeuvre the ball away from Tom Huddlestone . Enner Valencia - lively and energetic as has become expected. The first-half saw him dropping a little too deep as West Ham struggled to create anything in attack but his powerful shot three minutes after the break led to McGregor spilling and Andy Carroll opening the scoring. He also supplied an excellent assist to Morgan Amalfitano for the match-settling second goal on 69 minutes. 7 . SUBSTITUTES . Winston Reid (for James Collins 49) - assured at the back as Hull's attacking instincts dulled in the second-half. 6 . Morgan Amalfitano (for Mark Noble 65) - a lovely composed finish for West Ham's second goal after having the presence of mind to find space in the right channel. 6.5 . Joey O'Brien (for James Tomkins 75) - helped ensure there would be no drama late on. 6 . Substitutes not used: Jarvis, Jaaskelainen, Poyet, Cole . HULL CITY . Allan McGregor - had rarely been troubled in the first-half as West Ham struggled to impose themselves but was ready and alert towards the end to dive low and bravely deny Valencia just in front of the goal. But he made a real hash of stopping Valencia's shot early in the second-half, spilling it out for Carroll to profit. 5 . Hull goalkeeper Allan McGregor should have done better to hold Valencia's shot before Carroll pounced . James Chester - withdrew from the match prematurely with what looked to be an arm or shoulder injury after James Collins landed awkwardly on him following a corner. Prior to going off in stoppage time, Chester had enjoyed plenty of space down the right-flank and was often able to get into a crossing position. 6 . James Chester was forced to go off in first-half stoppage time after landing heavily on his arm . Alex Bruce - Wasn't overly taxed in the first-half as those further forward made all the running in the game. Rescued his side with a clearance following a teasing free-kick delivery on 39 minutes and then took a hefty whack to the face that led to his withdrawal at the break. 5 . Curtis Davies (c) - responsible for the game's pivotal moment when he was too slow to react to Andy Carroll's dart across him to give West Ham the lead. Until that point had dealt well with the rare attacks West Ham had produced. After that point shared the nervousness that infected the Hull back line. 6 . Curtis Davies jumps with Andy Carroll in one of the many aerial duels during the match . Michael Dawson - handled most things that came his way in the air, even against Andy Carroll, and looked resolute in the first-half. He gave a sheepish smile after a massive let-off in the second period when his careless sideways pass across the edge of the box was seized upon by Valencia. He broke defensive rule No 1 there. 6 . David Meyler - intelligent in his passing and movement, Meyler was a key component as Hull dominated the first 45. One moment of note was when he combined well with Quinn to launch an attack on 37 minutes. Like his team-mates, was knocked back by West Ham's first goal and was never quite able to find his rhythm again. 6 . Tom Huddlestone - in good form during the first period in terms of tackles to instigate attacks, reading of the play and also a couple of chances that were wide of the mark. Failed to replicate this after half-time as Hull lost their 'bite' in midfield. 6 . Tom Huddlestone closes down West Ham's Stewart Downing during the Premier League encounter . Jake Livermore - was responsible for many of the slick and accurate passes through the midfield that made Hull look so impressive before the break. But as they were unable to gain a goal, their impressive play counted for nothing and Livermore was, like many of the others, a passenger in the second-half as West Ham turned it on. 6.5 . Ahmed Elmohamady - his long strides were a feature of the opening 45 and West Ham afforded him too much respect coming forward. He had fired the opening salvo on five minutes, firing a fierce right-foot shot wide. Was booked for the faintest of clips on Downing. Like the others, lacked impact after the break. 6 . Stephen Quinn - looked threatening down the left flank before half-time and combined well with Livermore and Meyler. He evaded the offside trap on 31 minutes but his cut-back from a very good position was poor. Grew more ineffective and frustrated in the second-half and was booked for an over-zealous tackle on Amalfitano on 74 minutes. 6 . Sone Aluko - made a blistering start to the match and had James Tomkins in knots twice inside the opening two minutes alone. He also showed incredible pace to set up a chance for Elmohamady on five minutes. His best chance arrived on 23 minutes but he seemed to falter in front of goal, took too many touches and was snuffed out by Collins. Made little difference in second-half. 6.5 . Sone Aluko controls the ball wide on the right wing during an impressive first-half performance . SUBSTITUTES . Maynor Figueroa (for James Chester 45+3) - was kept busy but unable to stem the Hammers tide. 5.5 . Harry Maguire (for Alex Bruce ht) - thrown on ostensibly as a defender but quickly pushed into a more forward-minded position. 6 . Yannick Sagbo (for Curtis Davies 70) - arrived with too little and too late to affect the outcome. 5 .

"After Middlesbrough’s sensational upset of his former club, you could have forgiven Adam Clayton for trying to swap shirts with one of his illustrious opponents. Sergio Aguero, maybe, or Vincent Kompany? No chance. The 26-year-old midfielder, deemed surplus to requirements at the Etihad Stadium in 2010 after 12 years at City, had no interest in giving anyone his own memento of the big day. ‘I didn’t get a shirt,’ he explained after Patrick Bamford and Kike clinched a stunning victory for the well-drilled Championship promotion chasers. Adam Clayton said the only memento he wanted from the win at the Etihad Stadium was his own shirt . ‘I’m keeping my own after beating City on their own turf. I want my shirt.’ For many on Teesside this fully deserved victory was sweet. Bamford, on loan from City’s title rivals Chelsea, will have relished the opportunity to show he can succeed on the big stage while goalkeeper Tomas Mejias, who denied the home side from racing clear in the first half, had a point to prove after a shaky start to his career with the club. But for Clayton, who grew up 10 minutes away from City’s old Maine Road stomping ground, it meant more than most. He was sent packing without making a first-team appearance as cash from Abu Dhabi — and a host of star names — rolled in. ‘I was on the bench here a couple of times under Mark Hughes,’ he explained. ‘That was good considering the calibre of players they were bringing in. To come back here and win is a nice victory for us.’ Middlesbrough striker Patrick Bamford celebrates after scoring for his side against Manchester City . Bamford (second right) celebrates with his team-mates after scoring  at Etihad Stadium in the FA Cup fourth round . Clayton, whose grandfather has been a City fan for 60 years, admitted his family was divided over the tie but added that he had made his father’s afternoon. ‘My mum’s side are City fans,’ he said. ‘My dad’s a United fan, though, so I’m sure he’ll have enjoyed the day.’ A former ballboy at the Etihad, Clayton said that only Joe Hart remained from his time at the club and that the England keeper, who was benched for the match, had congratulated him at the end. ‘I spoke to Joe and a few of the staff I know and they just said “Well done” — and to be fair I think we did play quite well. ‘It was nice to get a little pat on the back and to see the place again.’ Much had been made of City’s late arrival from their five-day mid-season jaunt to the desert homeland of their owners. Some claimed that landing back in Manchester on Friday evening, hours before the fourth-round tie, illustrated a lack of respect for their opponents. Clayton, whose path to Middlesbrough included stops in Carlisle, Leeds and Huddersfield, was having none of that. ‘They are used to travelling around the world, Champions League games, tours, all that stuff so I don’t think that will have affected them too much,’ he said. Substitute Kike celebrates after scoring in added time to seal his side's place in the next round . Manchester City players James Milner (left), Dedryck Boyata (centre) and Fernando look dejected after their side concede . ‘You could argue it’s not the best preparation, but I’m sure they did everything they could to make them comfortable.’ Despite his elation, and his boss Aitor Karanka’s close relationship with Manuel Pellegrini’s title rival Jose Mourinho, Clayton insisted he still wanted City to go on and pip the London club to the Premier League title. ‘I hope they go on to win it, although I can’t say that as Aitor likes Jose!’ he joked. ‘I don’t mind. But we’re in the next round so that’s what matters.’ A beaming Karanka had his family at the post-match press conference as he reflected on his finest moment in 14 months of management. He had spent the afternoon frustrating opposite number Pellegrini — and that continued after the match when the Chilean had to wait for him to finish before facing the media himself. It was one of those days.","Middlesbrough beat Manchester City 2-0 in the FA Cup fourth round .

"Alan Pardew has walked into Crystal Palace and taken a relegation-threatened side who had one victory in 14 to win four on the trot. But not even knocking a Southampton team third in the Barclays Premier League out of the fourth round of the FA Cup will let him sleep easy this week. Loan signing Yaya Sanogo scored his first goal since a move from Arsenal and Marouane Chamakh netted twice as Palace twice came from behind to win. Crystal Palace striker Yaya Sanogo, on loan from Arsenal, foudn the net against Southampton in the FA Cup . Marouane Chamakh scored a brace as Palace twice came from behind to progress to the fifth round . Southampton conceded more than two goals for only the second time this season. ‘Blimey, I’m going to have some sleepless nights deciding which players should play up front,’ Pardew admitted. ‘It’s a really lovely problem for us.’ Another forward, Dwight Gayle, hit a double in a 3-2 victory against relegation rivals Burnley the week before and he has four in three games under Pardew. Results under the new boss, who made the shock move from Newcastle at the start of January, leave them 13th, but only four points off the bottom three. And Pardew will not rest easy as they face home games against Everton, Newcastle and Arsenal and a visit to Leicester. He added: ‘The strikers I’ve got can score goals at Premier League level. I think I’ve seen enough to prove that.’ Palace manager Alan Pardew joked he will have sleepless nights deciding which players should play up front . Another forward player flourishing under Pardew is Wilfried Zaha. He set up the second goal in the victory and had a hand in the third. The winger looks confident under a boss he feels trusts him after struggling under David Moyes and Louis van Gaal at Manchester United before his loan. Zaha explained: ‘I said to myself if I got minutes on the pitch I would get better and better. To find a manager that has got trust in me and gets me on the pitch is great.’","Yaya Sanogo, on loan from Arsenal, scored his first Crystal Palace goal .

"West Ham United fans were booing at half-time but what a difference 45 minutes makes. Three goals, three points, no jeers, just cheers. You have to wonder what West Ham boss Sam Allardyce was thinking as he went off at the break. In the corresponding fixture against Hull City last season the Hammers were booed off after winning - a reaction that triggered Allardyce’s now infamous hand-cupped-to-the-ear gesture.

History repeated itself on Sunday, but Allardyce admitted his side deserved the flak, attributing his side’s poor first-half to an FA Cup hangover after Tuesday’s penalty shoot-out win over Everton. ‘We were not good in the first-half,’ he said. ‘When you have expectation of watching exciting games like the one against Everton it’s disappointing for fans to see us play so poorly,. ‘I’ve never seen us pass so poorly this season and that was a legacy of our efforts on Tuesday night.’ West Ham were far more direct in the second-half - a style for which in the past Allardyce has been criticised heavily - but the tactics paid dividends as goals from Andy Carroll, Morgan Amalfitano and Stewart Downing secured victory. ‘All this tippy-tappy stuff... everybody keeps going on about the right way to play football, it’s all a load of old b******s sometimes,’ said Allardyce. ‘Getting the ball in the opposition’s box as quickly as you can with quality is sometimes the best way forward.

Hull could not deal with West Ham’s second-half approach and, as a result, suffered a fourth defeat in five. To make matters worse, their already lengthy injury list grew after injuries to James Chester and Alex Bruce. ‘James has dislocated his shoulder. If he needs surgery he could be out for at least two months,’ said manager Steve Bruce. ‘Alex has a thigh problem which could be him out for at least a month. ‘We were delighted with our first-half but you have to score when you’re on top. You can’t let good teams like West Ham off the hook.’ Indeed, Hull started quickly, winning two corners inside the first two minutes - both times after excellent play from Sone Aluko. After six minutes he set up Ahmed Elmohamady, who fired wide when unmarked. Hull were given an insight of what was to follow in the 41st minute when Enner Valencia’s looping header hit the top of the bar. That was not enough to stop the half-time jeers but Allardyce’s team were transformed after the break and went ahead in the 49th minute. Valencia chanced a shot from 30 yards but though Allan McGregor parried the effort, Carroll nipped in front of Curtis Davies to tap home. Just 10 minutes later it was 2-0, substitute Morgan Amalfitano converting Valencia’s pass, before Downing coolly slotted the third goal two minutes later.

"England gave their full backing to one-day captain Eoin Morgan after he was caught up in a bizarre attempted blackmail plot over his personal life. Morgan was due to lead England against Australia here at the Bellerive Oval  despite Scotland Yard becoming involved in a botched plan to demand £35,000 from Morgan over a relationship he had with a Hobart woman. The ECB are satisfied that Morgan has done nothing wrong but the blackmail plot was an unexpected and unwelcome distraction for an England team who were looking to build on their comprehensive victory over India in Brisbane. England's one-day captain Eoin Morgan was the subject of a £35,000 blackmail plot . The ECB received an email demanding money or details of Morgan's past relationship would be revealed . Morgan is currently preparing his England team for Friday's Tri-series clash with Australia in Hobart . One of the more unexpected dramas involving an England cricketer emerged when the ECB attempted to defuse the potential embarrassment of the saga by going public on the details of the scam. The fiancé of a woman Morgan had a relationship with five years ago, before he met his long-term Australian girlfriend Tara Ridgway, sent two emails to the ECB threatening to release details of the fling unless he was paid £35,000. Nick Emery said he would release ‘sexually charged’ messages and videos involving Morgan and his now fiancé Brooke Tsakirakis, unless he was paid the money before the start of this morning’s Tri-series match here in Hobart. The ECB immediately told Scotland Yard about the plot and British detectives were able to track the man down within 24 hours. Emery then withdrew his threat, saying he was ‘in a bad head space.’ Paul Downton, England’s managing director, was then forced to deal with the latest and perhaps most extraordinary drama of an eventful first year in the job which has seen him oversee the departures of Andy Flower and Kevin Pietersen, the appointment of Peter Moores and the sacking of Alastair Cook as one-day captain which led to Morgan’s appointment last month. The England captain spars with Andrew Flintoff at an England practice session in Brisbane last week . The ECB confirmed no further action would be taken against Morgan's would-be blackmailer . ‘There were references to a relationship Eoin Morgan had five years ago with a single Australian lady,’ said Downton. ‘It was a brief relationship and this appears to be a fairly deliberate attempt to extort a sum of money from the ECB. The man has now apologised saying he did not intend it to go this far.’ The ECB decided not to press charges against Emery and consider the matter closed but Morgan will be very much under the spotlight in front of Australian crowds now. The Irishman is a cool, calm character who keeps his private life very much to himself and takes satisfaction from the fact that not even many of his team-mates know much about him or even where he lives. There was no suggestion that he would miss the upcoming game and his failure to appear before the media on the eve of the game was hardly unusual as the one-day captain does not always give the pre and post match press conferences. He will shrug off any barracking he may receive. But England, who have had a traumatic year ever since they were thrashed 5-0 here in Australia during the last Ashes, must wonder what on earth will come next as they attempt to have a more settled 2015 than last year. This is the most unlikely of distractions before a big match. Morgan will lead England at the upcoming Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand .","Eoin Morgan has been the subject of a failed blackmail plot .

"Alan Pardew has a knack with strikers. It is widely regarded as the hardest part of the game – getting the ball over that painted white line between the goalposts and into the back of the net. It is why forwards are the most sought-after, expensive and adored assets in the game. Yaya Sanogo (second left) fires past Fraser Forster in the Southampton goal for his first goal in a Palace shirt . Fraizer Campbell (second left) grabs Sanogo in celebration after he pulled the Eagles level at St Mary's . But Pardew has a history of getting those who have recently signed for him ticking, and Yaya Sanogo was yet another example of that when he controlled a pass from Wilfried Zaha and finished over Southampton goalkeeper Fraster Forster  in Crystal Palace's FA Cup fourth-round win. Arsene Wenger had not managed to draw a league goal from the player in his 18 months in north London, in 11 appearances. After signing Sanogo on loan Pardew insisted that it was not necessarily goals that make a striker and that he can offer the 'chaos factor.' But Sanogo grabbed the No 9 shirt and was determined to prove what Wenger claims to have seen in him. In only his second match, he was off the mark. At Newcastle, Pardew had a similar effect on his new recruits. Papiss Cisse scored on his debut against Aston Villa after his £9million move from Freiburg in January of 2012. Then netted against Wolves two games later. By the end of the campaign he had played 14 games and scored 13 goals. Alan Pardew, pictured at St Mary's on Saturday, seems to have a knack of getting his strikers firing . Sanogo and Wilfried Zaha (left), both on loan at Crystal Palace, celebrate in front of their supporters . Pardew had a similar effect on Demba Ba (left) and Papiss Cisse (right) while at Newcastle United . Demba Ba netted 17 in his first season at Newcastle following a move on a free from West Ham – and he was supposed to have knees made of glass. When Pardew took over at Southampton in 2009 for his brief spell in charge he made Rickie Lambert one of his first signings. The £1m man from Bristol Rovers scored on his debut versus Leyton Orient, had three in his first three and an astounding 37 goals in 59 appearances that year. Not that he is a new recruit, but Marouane Chamakh had two by half-time as Palace went 3-2 up against Southampton his first appearance in six weeks and first under Pardew. As the half-time whistle blew, the travelling Palace supporters were singing their manager's name: 'Super, super Al, super, super Al, super, super Al, super Alan Pardew.' By the final whistle, it was even louder. Sanogo gees up the Eagles' support after netting his first goal in a Palace shirt in the FA Cup fourth round . Sanogo celebrates after scoring against Southampton, as Palace overcame the Saints to progress in the Cup . Sanogo could've had more, too. His low shot which Forster fumbled led to Chamakh's first and he headed narrowly over the bar from a corner. Arsene Wenger has compared him to Nicolas Anelka. 'Up front it's an instinctive job,' he said. 'Experience helps a little bit. But the belief, the confidence, is more important up front than the experience. 'When I started to play Anelka, everybody said: “Why do you start Anelka, why not buy a striker?” We won a championship with him. It's just like that, if we feel they are ready then they play.; . He was bought from Paris Saint-Germain for £500,000 and sold on to Real Madrid for £23m after two years.

"West Ham striker Diafra Sakho has spoken of his 'sadness and anger' at criticism directed towards him for not representing Senegal at the African Nations Cup this month. Sakho was ruled out of the three-week tournament with a back injury, but came off the bench to score the winner on Sunday as the Hammers beat Bristol City 1-0 in the FA Cup fourth round. A number of Senegal fans vented their frustration on Sakho's official Facebook page by posting comments underneath a picture of him celebrating the goal at Ashton Gate.

Sakho salutes the travelling fans after coming off the bench and giving the Irons a crucial late lead . One fan wrote: 'So you're not injured?' and another commented: 'Congratulations on your goal, I hope you never play for Senegal again, the Senegalese people feel betrayed.' Sakho responded: 'I took the time to browse all your reactions on social networks. Very quickly my joy from scoring and rescuing my club has turned into sadness and anger. 'Sadness because some of your words touched me deep in my person and my heart and this, without you knowing what has really happened. Sakho and Aaron Cresswell celebrate in front of the 1,006 Hammers faithful at Ashton Gate . 'And great anger, because after all my struggles day after day, season after season to finally wear the jersey of my homeland, and my family, the only nation that matters to me - you doubt my love and my patriotism. 'My absence at CAN 2015 (the African Nations Cup), my first CAN, was not painless. 'The dream of contributing to the victory of my country got away from me this year, but it is not dead! 'Never doubt the lion sleeping in me, as I never doubt the passion that burns within you.' Senegal accused West Ham of a 'lack of respect' when the striker withdrew from the African Nations Cup earlier this month and threatened to consult FIFA and the Football Association to prevent the 25-year-old from playing during the competition. Sakho is joined by his jubilant team-mates, including Carroll, whose right-footed cross found its marker . Sakho, who has scored 10 goals since moving to Upton Park in the summer, suffered a recurrence of a back injury against West Brom on New Year's Day. Senegal asked to carry out their own medical assessment on the striker, as is their right according to FIFA rules, but West Ham said Sakho could not fly and suggested Senegal's doctors came to London instead. The Hammers also sent Senegal independent medical reports, as well as the club's own examinations, to prove the extent of the injury. FIFA said it would not comment on individual cases, but Annexe 1 of its regulations state: 'A player who has been called up by his association for one of its representative teams is, unless otherwise agreed by the relevant association, not entitled to play for the club with which he is registered during the period for which he has been released or should have been released pursuant to the provisions of this annexe. 'This restriction on playing for the club shall, moreover, be prolonged by five days in the event that the player, for whatsoever reason, did not wish to or was unable to comply with the call-up.' Sakho could feature in two further games before the African Nations Cup ends, as West Ham play Liverpool and Manchester United before the tournament final on February 8. Senegal are top of Group C and need only a draw against Algeria on Tuesday to qualify for the knockout stages.","Diafra Sakho missed was ruled out of the three-week tournament .

'Every player needs to know: if Ronaldo and Messi are there, the third player doesn't have a chance. 'When another Bayern player gets nominated, we should have a discussion whether it's even worth going. What's the point? To get your picture taken? It's just politics for me.'

"Jose Mourinho has refused to dwell on Chelsea's disgraceful FA Cup exit to Bradford as he eyes a Wembley final at the expense of Liverpool. Mourinho, who on Monday celebrated his 52nd birthday, labelled last Saturday's loss to League One Bradford a 'disgrace' and 'unacceptable' after the Blues led 2-0 only to fall to a 4-2 defeat. Chelsea face Liverpool at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday night with their Capital One Cup semi-final poised at 1-1 after the first leg and Mourinho has quickly recalibrated. Jose Mourinho (centre) wants his side to move on from the disappointment of going out of the FA Cup . Chelsea manager (right) tried to shake hands with Bradford manager  Phil Parkinson (centre) before the end . 'The next game is the most important one,' Mourinho said on chelseafc.com. 'We need to forget this one (Bradford) and start the next game in a different competition, and I know we are one victory away from playing a final. 'It's the good thing about playing consecutive matches without many days in between. Petr Cech looks on after being beaten by a thunderous Jon Stead strike just before half-time . 'It's the good thing that, when you lose, you have to focus immediately on the next game. 'You don't have a lot of time to be moaning or analysing what happened in the bad one. Let's move and let's think about the next one. 'At the end of May, beginning of June, we don't go to Wembley to play the FA Cup final, that's for sure. 'The FA Cup is finished for us. We don't go there even to play the FA Cup semi-final. It's over for us. 'To go there - and I think that should mean a lot to everyone - the last chance we have is this one, to play there in the Capital One Cup final.' Bradford's Filipe Morais celebrates after equalising against Chelsea - who released him as a youngster . Mourinho is likely to revert to his first-choice players in a key week for Chelsea as holders Manchester City visit the leaders in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday. Having seen their challenge for an unprecedented quadruple ended by Bradford, Chelsea know they must perform at their best to keep alive their remaining hopes of silverware. Didier Drogba, one of the players who failed to see off Bradford, believes the game-by-game approach of his manager is the right one. Didier Drogba was unable to find the scoresheet on Saturday but hopes that Chelsea can bounce back . 'Of course everything is capable this season, but at the same time, you can lose everything, like on Saturday,' said Drogba, who on Sunday collected the 2015 Football Writers' Association Tribute Award at a gala dinner in London. 'We need to stay focused on what we want to achieve, but also at the same time we have to take it game by game from now until the end of the season, because this is the part of the season where everything is decided more and matters. 'After a defeat, you always want to bounce back and that is what we hope to do.' Saturday's match is likely to feature Frank Lampard, Chelsea's record goalscorer, returning to Stamford Bridge in the light blue of City. Frank Lampard set to return to Stamford Bridge for the first time since leaving the club in the summer . Lampard spent 13 years at Chelsea, many of them alongside Drogba, with the pair instrumental in many successes, not least three Premier League titles and a Champions League success. Lampard's Chelsea contract was not renewed last summer and he signed for Major League Soccer's New York City FC, only to then join City on a short-term deal which has been extended until the end of the season due to his fine form. The 36-year-old former England international, who scored the equaliser in a 1-1 draw at the Etihad Stadium earlier this season, will be aiming to help second-placed City narrow the five-point gap with a win at his old hunting ground. Lampard scored a spectacular 147 goals for Chelsea during his 13 years at the club . 'I hope he is going to get the best reception like I had last year when I came to the Bridge with Galatasaray because that is the least he deserves,' Drogba added. 'I am not surprised by what he has done at Manchester City this season. 'I think he is a professional and that is how he was when he played for Chelsea and why I have so much respect for him and what he is doing there. 'For a fantastic player like him, he can play anywhere so that is why I am not surprised by his current form.'","Jose Mourinho's side were knocked out of the FA Cup by Bradford City .

"They have no training ground, one of the smallest budgets in the entire Football League and, some might say, little chance of reaching the fifth round of the FA Cup. But after a weekend of upsets, Rochdale will fancy their chances of adding Stoke City to the list of Premier League casualties on Monday evening. Manchester City's capitulation to Middlesbrough after a few days in Abu Dhabi does not augur well for the Potters, who have been sunning themselves in Dubai ahead of the visit to Spotland. Rochdale's inspirational manager Keith Hill (right) has been nursing a virus for most of the week . Volunteers spent last week clearing snow off the covers while inspirational manager Keith Hill was laid up in bed. 'A little bit of cup fever,' suggests Hill. He and Rochdale were made for one another. A former defender for the Greater Manchester club, the 45-year-old is in his second spell as manager having led them out of the fourth tier of English football in each of his two tenures. Rochdale currently occupy a play-off place in League One, and this is the second year in a row they have reached the fourth round of the FA Cup. Hill's £1.5million budget would hardly cover the wages of Stoke's players for a week, but he dismisses suggestions that Mark Hughes's side might not be up for the fight on Monday night. Stoke City boss Mark Hughes believes his side will be refreshed after their winter break to Dubai . 'I don't think there will be any surprises for Stoke,' he says. 'They've got quite a few British-based players. 'With the likes of Peter Crouch. Ryan Shawcross, Jon Walters and Glenn Whelan in there, there's a nucleus of players who understand what it takes in a game like this. 'Knowing Mark Hughes, I don't think he will let his team get complacent playing against a team like Rochdale.' Hill is a big Manchester United fan who saw Hughes win three FA Cup winner's medals during his time at Old Trafford. His favourite memory is Eric Cantona's decisive Cup Final strike against Liverpool in 1996. Rochdale's Scott Tanser in action for Rochdale against Crawley Town . 'Another one is 1977 when United beat Liverpool. That was one of my first stand-out moments where I said, 'Wow, the FA Cup is special'. 'I grew up admiring Martin Buchan and Gordon McQueen. They're really big players in my memory. I'm not a glory Manchester United supporter, I support the history of the club and what's made it special, even in those days when they weren't so successful. 'Mark was an exceptional player for United and is equally a very good manager. The way he played resembles his teams.' Rochdale's chairman Chris Dunphy made his money from heating churches and the club are proud to operate within their means — even if they have to do without a permanent training base. Stoke will be hoping to avoid a fourth round FA Cup upset when they take on League One outfit Rochdale . Hill says: 'We beg, steal or borrow facilities — the majority of the time we borrow. There's always a plan in place regardless of not having a permanent fixed training venue. 'But we don't go borrowing from the bank. We regenerate our own money which is special, but to continue to be successful is hard. If I thought about it too much I'm sure it would scare me. 'We should really be fighting against relegation because we've got the smallest budget in the league and we're fighting against some really big sides for the opportunity to remain in a play-off place. 'One thing I would say about the players is that they have embraced the FA Cup. We've played nine games in this competition in the last two seasons and only been beaten once. 'It can help the coffers, it certainly does. We don't budget to get so far in the FA Cup. The prize money itself has generated income, but for the players it's about playing Stoke.'","Rochdale face Stoke City in the fourth round of the FA Cup .

"Kyle Naughton says he plans to follow Gylfi Sigurdsson's example in proving a Swansea hit after making the same move from Tottenham.

'This is one of the best places to come and do that and also this style of football will suit me.' Naughton managed only 74 appearances in five-and-a-half years at Spurs and went out on loan to Middlesbrough, Leicester and Norwich in search of regular first-team football. His path at White Hart Lane was blocked by his former Sheffield United team-mate and England right-back Kyle Walker, but the 26-year-old is determined to prove that he can establish himself at the top level.

'There were rumours about another loan, but I wanted to be settled because I think you play better football then,' Naughton said. 'Spurs are a massive club, they're forever bringing players in and out and sometimes it can be a little unsettling. 'Last year I played around 30 games while Kyle was injured, but he came back into the set-up and now he's playing every game again.

"It has taken him four matches to get there, but today Andy Murray finally gets top billing at the Australian Open for his fourth round showdown with Grigor Dimitrov. The two of them have been given the prime-time slot of the late evening match on the main Rod Laver Arena — at about 9.45am UK time on Sunday morning — even getting the vote over local heroes Nick Kyrgios and Bernard Tomic. Although Murray-Dimitrov is a lip-smacking prospect, it was still a surprise move, given how much interest there is here in the gifted young Australians, who were scheduled on the Margaret Court and Hisense Arenas. Andy Murray preparing in practice for his fourth round clash at the Australian Open . Murray celebrates on his way to his third straight-sets win of the week in Melbourne in the third round . Imagine Britain having two emerging young players making the last 16 of Wimbledon and newspaper front pages, and then being scheduled on Court One and Two, and you get the idea. Murray has been in excellent form, and about the only thing that has been bothering him is the concern he expressed this weekend with his brother about how few tennis facilities have been built in his native Scotland. For now he will concentrate on reversing the outcome of the Wimbledon quarter-final of last summer when Dimitrov knocked an unusually flat and tetchy opponent out in straight sets. One factor in this match is that sitting in the Bulgarian’s corner, as he was in SW19, is Australian coach Roger Rasheed, such a respected friend of the Scot that he came close to hiring him as his head coach before the appointment of Ivan Lendl at the start of 2012. Muray will take on Grigor Dimitrov in the fourth round, the man who knocked him out of Wimbledon last year . Dimitrov brought an abrupt end to Murray's defence of his Wimbledon title at the quarter-final stage in 2014 . As a result Murray and Dimitrov are regular sparring partners. ‘We were actually going to be practising with Andy the weekend before the tournament started, but then we found out that we were close to each other in the draw, so obviously neither player would want to hit with the other under those circumstances,’ said Rasheed yesterday. ‘It’s one of those cases where they know each other’s games well, there aren’t going to be too many secrets between them.’ It will be their seventh meeting, with Murray leading the series 4-2, both of his two defeats coming last year. What is clear from Murray’s demeanour here is that he has his ‘game head’ on, and is very fired up to produce another run deep into this event. Overall you would predict him to edge it, although Dimitrov is a wonderful shotmaker and a surefire future Grand Slam winner capable of beating anyone. Australian young star Nick Kyrgios could face Andy Murray in the quarter-finals in Melbourne . And fellow Australian young gun Bernard Tomic has also made it through to the fourth round .","Andy Murray set to face Grigor Dimitrov in fourth round of Australian Open .

"One Williams sister was battling away in the Rod Laver Arena, motivating herself by looking at the scoreboard during changeovers to see how her sister’s comeback was progressing elsewhere. That seemed to do the trick, and by the end both Serena and Venus were into the fourth round of the Australian Open, the first time they have both reached this stage of a Grand Slam since Wimbledon 2010. It is no surprise that the younger sibling has got this far, but more notable that Venus is in contention again, because she has not made the second week of a major since being diagnosed with Sjogren’s Syndrome, an autoimmune disease, in 2011. Venus Williams battled back from a set and a break down to beat Camila Giorgi in the Australian Open . Williams plays a forehand during the match against Giorgi on Saturday . It is shaping up to be another remarkable fortnight for the sisters, very late in their careers. In her 35th year, Venus has won eight of eight matches in 2015, dating back to her WTA title win at the Auckland Open. She now faces sixth seed Agnieszka Radwanska, having recovered from 2-4 down in the second set to overcome Italian Camila Giorgi 4-6, 7-6, 6-1. Serena, 33, who later said she hoped Andy Murray would win the men’s title, also came back to beat Elina Svitolina 4-6, 6-2, 6-0. The sisters remain a formidable force at an age when so many of their former rivals have departed. ‘We talk about the players we see that aren’t playing any more — we just can’t figure out how we are still here,’ said Venus. ‘When you walk on that court there’s no such thing as age, height, any of that stuff. It’s a matter of can you get the ball in, can you win the point or not? Serena Williams in action during her third round match against Elina Svitolina . The 33-year-old celebrates beating Svilolina on day six of the Australian Open on Saturday . 'I think everybody we grew up with has moved on, in a mature life. I think our perspective is that we’re still quite good at what we do and while we’re here we’re going to be here — when we’re gone we might watch on TV.’ There is no doubt that they motivate each other, and Serena said that when she was down against Svitolina she saw the score updates of her sister coming from the Margaret Court Arena, and it spurred her on. ‘I’ve been motivated by Serena since day one, she’s always been someone that anyone can learn from,’ added Venus. ‘We’ve had the fortunate relationship to be able to grow from each other. I don’t think I could have done the things I’ve done without her.’ Venus’s ranking has floated between 20 and 50 since she was diagnosed with Sjogren’s Syndrome, but her form this year is already guaranteed to have pushed her up to at least No 12. ‘That’s awesome,’ she said. ‘I’ve been trying a long time to get my ranking up. It’s hard to be ranked lower than what you know you are. Andy Murray, pictured in action during practice on Friday, has a big fan in the shape of Serena Williams . 'I've won big, it’s not like I haven’t done it before. Is fourth round my goal when I come to these tournaments? No.’ World No 1 Serena now faces Spain’s exciting Garbine Muguruza. This was the player who beat her in the second round of the French Open last year, one of the three pre-quarter-final defeats in the Grand Slams through 2014. Serena was delighted that the sister act is back on. ‘It feels good, it means a lot. I saw her score and thought, wow, she’s been through so much with illness, if she can do it I’m perfectly healthy, I’m fine, I should be able to do it, too. It helped me push through.’ Serena also revealed how much of a fan she is of Britain’s Murray. ‘I’m rooting for Andy the whole time,’ she said. ‘I like his attitude, always have, I like how he gets every ball back. 'I played him recently in mixed doubles in an exhibition [at the Indian Premier Tennis League] and he destroyed me. Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova suffered a shock exit at the hands of Madison Keys . ‘I have a whole new appreciation for his game, he has great hands.’ Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova suffered a surprise exit from the tournament when she was beaten 6-4, 7-5 by 19-year-old American Madison Keys. At 5-5 in the final set, Keys, coached by three-time Grand Slam champion Lindsay Davenport, achieved the pivotal break of serve. She held in the next game, screaming with joy when Kvitova netted a backhand on match point. Keys will now face fellow American Madison Brengle, guaranteeing at least one US player in the quarter-finals.","Both Venus and Serena Williams battled back from a set down in their respective matches to advance to the fourth round of the Australian Open .

"FIFA presidential hopeful Jerome Champagne insists he is not being squeezed out of the race despite Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein entering the contest. Champagne, the French former FIFA deputy general secretary, has conceded that gaining the minimum five nominations may not be straightforward but rejected suggestions that the Jordanian prince's decision to run against Sepp Blatter has made things more difficult. He claimed that Europe is not united behind Prince Ali and pointed out that the Arab football world, lead by Asian confederation president Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa, had already declared support for Blatter. Jerome Champagne is confident that he can become FIFA's next president and replace Sepp Blatter . Champagne told Press Association Sport: ' Prince Ali is not squeezing anyone - look at who the Arab leaders are supporting. 'I am not squeezed at all and Prince Ali has not issued any programme yet, just slogans. 'UEFA and [president] Michel Platini have made strong statements in favour of Prince Ali but Europe is not united, it is very diverse, and I don't feel the squeeze at all. 'I welcome Prince Ali's candidacy as it is important for the future of football to have an open, democratic process but I am the only one who has placed on the table a detailed, concrete and financially viable list of proposals.' Incumbent Blatter (right) poses with hopeful candidate Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein of Jordan (left) Champagne expanded on an interview last week in which he said it was easier to win 50 votes in a secret ballot than the five nominations, and said he was still working flat out on his campaign. Nominations for the presidency have to be in before January 29, with the election being held in Zurich on May 29. He added: 'I am in full activity and I am continuing the style of the campaign to convince people. I am speaking to a lot of federation presidents in order to explain my ideas and I feel very optimistic. Champagne believes he is the only presidential candidate to have laid out details and viable proposals . 78-year-old Blatter has overseen four terms as FIFA president since assuming the office in June 1998 . 'But I have said it is more difficult to gain five open published letters of nomination than 50 voters in secret ballot.' Champagne, 56, said this was due to all the confederations except CONCACAF, which represents football in north and central America and the Caribbean, having already taken a position in support of either Blatter or Prince Ali. UEFA has yet to formally declare their backing but its president Platini has made it clear he will not support 78-year-old Blatter for a fifth term.

"In Spain, all talk is of Wednesday night's Copa del Rey clash where Atletico Madrid bravely defended for 84minutes before a dubious penalty decision allowed Lionel Messi to give Barcelona the upper hand heading into the second leg. The Argentinian phenomenon was once again seen vomiting on the pitch during the game, which has been a recurrent problem this season. According to Marca, the 27-year-old has undergone tests to determine the problem, which appears to be chronic sinusitis. Nonetheless, Messi is lauded by the likes of AS and Mundo Deportivo, although Madrid-friendly Marca leads with Diego Simeone's declaration that Atletico 'can come back'. Lionel Messi was seen vomiting on the pitch, a recurrent theme that's understood to be caused by sinusitis . The Barcelona forward scored a late winner to give his side an advantage in the Copa del Rey . Despite the recent power struggle between Messi and coach Luis Enrique, Barcelona have rediscovered their form in recent weeks - something that has not gone unnoticed by Simeone. 'Barcelona have improved a great deal in these last two games,' he told a news conference. 'Above all in putting on the pressure in the opponents' half,' added the former Argentina captain. 'It was their strength that they did not allow us to bring the ball out.' Elsewhere in La Liga, Real Madrid continue to attract the world's most sought after players both for the present and the future. Spanish press was focused on the Copa del Rey clash while Lucas Silva is close to joning Real Madrid . A deal for Brazilian midfielder and Arsenal target Lucas Silva is reportedly close while Norwegian teenage sensation Martin Odegaard is set to be unveiled at Valdebebas where he has been tagged 'Little Galactico'. Meanwhile, cup competitions also dominated the news in Italy where Roberto Mancini's Inter Milan reached the quarter-finals with a 2-0 victory over Sampdoria. Arsenal loan signing Lukas Podolski scored along with fellow new arrival Xherdan Shaqiri - while Fiorentina defeated Atalanta 3-1 in Wednesday night's other game, which included a goal from Chelsea target Juan Cuadrado.

Despite his problems, Corriere dello Sport claim that both AC Milan and Juventus are keen to take advantage of his situation to boost their strike forces.

"Not even the distraction of a spectator proposing to his girlfriend could prevent top seed Novak Djokovic from easing into the last 16 of the Australian Open on Saturday. The romantic fan popped the question after the second set of Djokovic's third-round match with Fernando Verdasco and received not only a 'yes', but a massive cheer from the rest of the crowd on Rod Laver Arena and applause from Djokovic himself. By that stage Djokovic had weathered the storm and was two sets ahead, the world number one crucially winning a tie-break in the opening set after failing to convert any of his six break points. VIDEO Scroll down to watch . Novak Djokovic advanced to the fourth round of the Australian Open for the ninth consecutive year . Djokovic made the fourth round of the Australian Open with a 7-6 (8), 6-3, 6-4 win over Fernando Verdasco . Djokovic blows a kiss to the camera for his mother's birthday after winning his third round match . Djokovic of Serbia saw off  Verdasco of Spain at the Australian Open in Melbourne on Saturday . 'Credit to Fernando, it was a great match,' Djokovic said in an on-court interview with four-time grand slim winner Jim Courier. 'Fernando is a top-10 player, he has played in the final stages of grand slams and big tournaments. He has big power in his game. 'Every time I had an opportunity for the break he came up with a service winner or an ace and obviously it was frustrating but I had to keep it together and the difference was made in the first set when I won the tie-break.' Verdasco was favourite to win that tie-break when an ace took him 5-3 ahead with another serve to come, but a terrible double fault let Djokovic off the hook and the Serbian eventually took his fourth set point to win it 10-8. Djokovic claimed an early break in the second set and crucially saved three break points in the next game with a hat-trick of aces. From then on there was only ever going to be one winner and Djokovic celebrated his 7-6 (10/8) 6-3 6-4 win by getting the crowd to sing Happy Birthday to his mother Dijana. Next up for the four-time champion is Luxembourg's Gilles Muller, who won a big-serving battle with American John Isner that unsurprisingly featured tie-breaks in the first two sets and a total of 54 aces. Four-time champion Djokovic beat Verdasco (pictured), who could not get to the fourth round . Djokovic hugs  Verdasco after beating the Spaniard at the Australian Open in the third round . Defending champion Stan Wawrinka had earlier continued his far more unobtrusive progress in the championship, beating Finland's Jarkko Nieminen 6-4 6-2 6-4 to maintain his record of not having dropped a set. The fourth seed sent down nine aces and won 90 per cent of points behind his first serve to set up a clash with Spain's Guillermo Garcia-Lopez in the fourth round. Garcia-Lopez was a similarly comfortable winner over Canada's Vasek Pospisil, beating the world number 60 6-2 6-4 6-4 to reach the last 16 and equal his best performance in a grand slam. 'I'm feeling good since the beginning of the tournament,' Wawrinka said. 'For sure I'm not the focus on the tournament because there's Novak, Rafa (Nadal) coming back from injury, Roger (Federer) also just lost, there's (Nick) Kyrgios, (Bernard) Tomic still playing. 'For sure I'm not the focus. For me doesn't matter. I'm feeling good. I'm feeling great. I'm happy the way I'm playing. To get to the second week again, it's great. So far everything is good for me.' Feliciano Lopez continued his charmed progress through the draw with victory over Poland's Jerzy Janowicz, the 12th seed winning 7-6 (8/6) 6-4 7-6 (7/3) to set up a last-16 contest with eighth seed Milos Raonic. The No 1-ranked Djokovic was able to see off the Spaniard and get to the fourth round for his ninth year . Djokovic supporters cheer his win after his third round match against Verdasco of Spain  in Melbourne . Lopez saved three match points in his first-round match with wild card Denis Kudla, eventually winning the fifth set 10-8, and saved another in the second round against Adrian Mannarino. Lopez was trailing 4-6 4-6 0-4 when Mannarino fell ill but won the third-set tie-break and was leading 4-0 in the fourth set when his unfortunate opponent retired. Lopez acknowledged he was making the most of his good fortune, adding: 'It gives you the chance. It gives you the opportunity to play today because I was already out with Mannarino and Kudla in the first round, no? 'Today when I was out there playing, I thought I have to be pleased for that opportunity, so try your best. I think today finally I play some of my best tennis. Losing with Kudla or Mannarino I wouldn't have the chance, so I feel very pleased. 'It's true I have a couple of tough matches. Today was also a tough one, but it was straight sets, which is really good for my fitness condition. I feel good. I feel ready to play the rest of the week.' Raonic continued the theme of one-sided matches by beating Germany's Benjamin Becker - who knocked out home favourite Lleyton Hewitt in the previous round - 6-4 6-3 6-3.

"There are plenty who would like to see Ryan Gauld make his Scotland debut against Georgia on Saturday. Far fewer who think he actually will. Gordon Strachan's message has been clear. The Sporting Lisbon playmaker, an utter rarity in the Scottish game, was brought in to the squad to get to know people. To familiarise himself with the faces, the hard humour, the initiation rituals. Scotland's national coach wants to speak to Gauld and watch him in action. He wants to find out, first hand, what the fuss is all about. Just how good he is. Ryan Gauld joined Portuguese club Sporting Lisbon from Dundee United this summer for  £3million . Gauld was called up to the Scotland squad by boss Gordon Strachan for this month's Euro 2016 qualifiers . None of this sounds like the former Dundee United prodigy is about to be plunged into the starting line-up in a must-win qualifier against Georgia. Still to start a first team game for Sporting, the teenager would have to play out of his skin in training to elbow his way to the front of a strong, established crop of Scotland attacking midfielders. And yet, as assistant manager Mark McGhee told the 18-year-old yesterday, stranger things have happened. The issue is not pre-determined. 'I pulled Ryan aside this morning and I said to him that, before the Croatia game last year, we pulled Barry Bannan up at the last minute. Ryan Gauld in action for Scotland's Under 19 team before being called up to the senior side . 'Barry trained so well he ended up playing. He has now played seven or nine games or something. 'So I said to Ryan: 'Don't be afraid or embarrassed to try. You don't need to think you are just here so we can get a look at you.' 'It's up to him really as to how much he shows Gordon about where he fits in to the pecking order. 'It's not a decision that has been made prior to him arriving here. He is here and one of the squad and if he shows up well enough he has a chance.' All coaches base their decisions on what they see on the training ground. Yet few put more store on what their eyes and instincts tell them than Gordon Strachan. Assistant manager Mark McGhee says Gauld is not in the squad just for the coaches to get a look at him . Asked if Gauld has any chance of starting, McGhee answered as he must: 'Absolutely.' Lifting a player's spirits and confidence before dumping them in a bin hours later has never been part of the Largs coaching manual. Yet the truth is this. For all the populist, public clamour to 'put the kids in', the likes of Shaun Maloney, Bannan, Ikechi Anya, Steven Naismith and James Morrison will take some shifting. Scotland have improved under these players. If Gauld progresses as football people suspect he might, the young man will take his place on merit soon enough. But not yet. 'Well, he has a lot of good players ahead of him,' McGhee conceded. 'It's hard for him to move up too quickly. But he can certainly put himself in Gordon's mind.' Strachan had implied that Gauld had been called up to the squad primarily to gain experience . He already did that, of course, the minute he signed for a giant club in Portugal for £3million. Scots footballers are not noted for extending their horizons much further than London. Intelligent and educated, Gauld has taken the same bold road McGhee took himself when he left Aberdeen for Hamburg in the 1980s. 'I was asked when he went there what I thought about that, and I thought: 'It can only be good for him,'said McGhee. 'The mentality it will bring and the broader outlook in life and as a person will test him and challenge him and that can only be good for his game.' Stevie May, the Sheffield Wednesday striker, is the other fresh addition to the squad for the forthcoming double header. Asked how they have bedded in so far, McGhee offered an approving nod. 'Really well. We really only got a couple of minutes with them this morning in a match situation, Gordon is very pleased with both of them. 'He commented on Stevie's movement and touch – and Ryan took up a couple of positions where you could see he was doing the things Gordon has talked about quite naturally. That's just what he does. So he was well pleased with him.' The 18-year-old Gauld (right) was  in Sporting Lisbon's Champions League squad to face Chelsea last month . Nevertheless, Saturday is an unlikely day to field fresh blood for the first time. McGhee, however, rejected the widespread notion that this is the first 'real' qualifier the latest management team have faced. In the public mindset the last World Cup campaign was already over by the time they took control at the beginning of last year. For Strachan, any notion of an extended honeymoon will end swiftly if the Scots take anything less than four from six points against Georgia and Poland. 'I don't think we needed or demanded or expected a honeymoon period,' claimed McGhee. 'We took responsibility for the first two performances and results (defeats to Serbia and Wales) and we would have been quite happy to accept some form of criticism for them. 'Because we were just in the job you guys gave us a lot. We are grateful for that because if took some of the pressure off and let us develop things in our head. But I think it started then and it continues.' Anything less than two reasonable results would be a blow to a Scottish game battered and buffeted by harsh financial winds. Scotland performed well in their first Euro 2016 qualifier but lost 2-1 to Germany in Dortmund . The national team have been a candle in the gloom in recent months and McGhee accepted that responsibility readily. 'Us winning every game in the campaign won't change the current predicament of the Scottish domestic game but, from the point of view of encouraging future footballers, it's always important.' As a former Celtic striker, McGhee is relishing the prospect of an international game at Ibrox. 'It's a fantastic place to play, I loved playing at Ibrox and I think the players will gain something out of that. Our approach to the game will gain something from that. I think everything is possible.' It's pretty unthinkable, in truth, that Scotland will do anything other than beat Georgia at home. Heading for Poland on Monday morning it's an imperative. And yet McGhee sounded a note of caution when he added: 'We've looked at them, I went to see them at the end of last season. We've looked at all the videos we could look at, we looked very closely at the Ireland game (a 2-1 home defeat for the Georgians) and we're convinced what we're seeing is a decent team. 'But pretty much outside of Germany the rest of us are going to have the ability to win any of the games. We have a game on Saturday night, it's at home, and that gives you a lot of advantages.'","Sporting Lisbon playmaker Ryan Gauld is in the Scotland squad for the Euro 2016 qualifiers against Georgia and Poland .

"Former Sporting Lisbon manager Paulo Sergio insists Ryan Gauld’s star is on the rise with the Portuguese giants after the Scottish teenager made his league debut on Sunday night. The former Hearts boss has been keeping tabs on Gauld since he made the £3million switch from Dundee United to Portugal last summer and saw the 19-year-old make an impression from the bench in the 4-2 win over Rio Ave. Gauld was introduced in the 65th minute and was involved when Joao Mario added a third goal two minutes later after the young Scot’s cheeky nut-meg set up former Manchester United winger Nani to cross. Sporting Lisbon's Ryan Gauld (left) vies with Rio Ave's forward Marvin Zeegelaar during his league debut for the club in a top flight Portuguese game on Sunday . Gauld came on as a substitute in the second half and played a role in Sporting's third goal in a 4-2 win . After initially being farmed out to Sporting’s B side, the hard work is starting to pay off for Gauld after he also started the recent League Cup wins over Vitoria Guimaraes and Boavista. Through his friendship with current Sporting coach Marco Silva, Sergio, who guided Hearts to a 5-1 Scottish Cup final thrashing over rivals Hibs in 2012, also knows that everyone at the Estadio Jose Alvalade is very excited about Gauld’s potential. Sergio said: ‘I watched the game and although Ryan didn’t have much time, he did well. ‘He showed good personality, character and he had influence in the third goal also. He’s done a good job in the B team and now he’s starting to come into the first team. I know Sporting’s coach very well and I know that he has great expectations with the kid. Gauld's first league appearance came after an impressive showing against Boavista in a League Cup match earlier in January . ‘Ryan has to be patient and keep doing his work because everybody believes, in the near future, he will become a regular player for the first team. It’s a very good sign for him that he made his first appearance in the league. ‘It appears to me that the work he is doing is going well. Everyone has big expectations of him.’ Sporting boss Silva also praised Gauld’s work ethic following his cameo appearance against Rio Ave. Gauld (right) chats with Sporting's Mahmoud Shikabala last summer, with the 19-year-old having had to adjust to life in Lisbon following his £3million switch from Dundee United . Silva said: ‘Ryan Gauld came on later in the game and it was a good debut for him. He’s still settling in to the club and still developing as a footballer. ‘But this is a boy who works very hard to make things happen. We were missing a bit of pace and dynamism before the substitution, but he gave us that. Ryan gave us more speed and intensity and supported the attack very well.’ As manager of Portuguese top-flight club Academica, Sergio’s team could come up against Gauld during the second half of the season. And the former Tynecastle boss reckons the decision to send the playmaker out to Sporting’s B side is now paying dividends. He added: ‘Nobody should think that because Ryan was playing in the second team that it’s not good for him. ‘At his age I believe it’s the right step because he has the possibility of playing every week, he will be playing lots of games and at his age it’s important he is playing regularly. ‘You need lots of games, it will help him develop his skills and his time will come because he is very young, he has a lot of talent and he has a football brain - everyone can see that. ‘It’s a natural process for Ryan for him to become an important player.’","Ryan Gauld came on as substitute to make Sporting Lisbon league debut .

"By joining the club which spawned Cristiano Ronaldo, Ryan Gauld ensured one thing. His old nickname was never likely to gain much traction. ‘I’ve managed to escape from the ‘Baby Messi’ tag, which I’m quite glad of,’ said Sporting Lisbon’s £3million summer signing. ‘It was a little bit strange and came about just because I’m small and left-footed. That’s the comparison and it was made only after about four or five games for Dundee United.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch Scottish teenager Ryan Gauld scores goal for Sporting . Ryan Gauld (centre) is joined by Glasgow schoolchildren in support of Scottish FA Performance School festival . That was all it took for Gauld to become a YouTube sensation. Four games, five at most. At the age of 11 he was one of the kids who flooded onto the Tannadice pitch at the end of a pre-season friendly with Barcelona. He claimed Lionel Messi’s autograph and hung it on his bedroom wall. Within weeks of being handed a first-team debut for United at the age of 17 his own scrawl became coveted. Not since Andy Murray dragged his stick thin frame through the early rounds of Wimbledon in 2005 had a young Scotsman been burdened with a level of expectation to match it. Gauld was fortunate. Wafer thin, modest and unassuming Scottish football’s great white hope – less white than he used to be after a couple of months in Portugal – was brought up in Laurencekirk. He remains well-spoken, grounded and remarkably normal for an 18-year-old almost submerged by the tsunami of speculation and headlines last season. ‘I’m really glad that I’m away from the hype which surrounded me,’ he conceded after signing a raft of autographs and posing for selfies with SFA performance school kids in Glasgow on Wednesday. Gauld was called up by Scotland for Euro 2016 qualifying double header against Georgia and Poland . ‘I’d only played just a few games for United when there were rumours and stories about other clubs being interested. It didn’t really affect me but it was beyond belief it was happening after just a couple of games. ‘To be over in Portugal now and starting again is really good for me. The main reason I chose to go abroad was the style of football is something I’ve always really liked. I also wanted to learn another language and see how things are done elsewhere.’ No one knows him as Baby Messi in Lisbon. At Sporting they have a tradition of breeding precociously talented young players. A £3m fee was big news here, but less so in the Portuguese capital. Gauld is part of the club’s Champions League squad, but has yet to play a game for the first team. His early weeks have been spent acclimatising to living abroad, alone, in his own flat. Satellite television and a wifi connection are all a young man needs to stay connected with home these days but homesickness has been unavoidable at times. ‘It did take me a wee bit of time to settle in, but I really like it now,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘Most of the team can speak English which is good for me. I just try to fill my time learning new things and every day after training I have my Portuguese lessons which helps too. Gauld joined Portuguese club Sporting Lisbon from Dundee United this summer for  £3million . ‘I try and keep myself occupied. To begin with I missed family and friends, but now I’ve been there a few months I’m dealing with it fine. ‘I knew before I signed that I’d miss everyone but I also knew that I could deal with it long-term.’ For Scots teenagers the horizons rarely spin any further than the white cliffs of Dover. Manchester City, Manchester United and Arsenal watched him, but his height – or lack of it – put English clubs off. Physically slight, if durable and resilient to tough challenges, Gauld was also tracked by Real Madrid and Juventus and made up his mind at an early stage to go abroad. Asked what the biggest cultural shock has been he responded: ‘The intensity of training. That’s been a big difference. ‘In Scotland you get a lot of time off - but in Portugal there are less days off. ‘I do notice that physically I’m a lot sharper and the individual programs have brought me on. ‘The training at United was great - but training at Sporting is a lot more demanding and no-one gets away with not giving 100 per cent every session.’ Hull City's Andrew Robertson impressed Strachan after training with the senior Scotland side . In a nation where young players fall into the trap of believing their own hype, Gauld knew there were grounds for improvement. Towards the end at United his form dipped. ‘I knew I wasn’t playing as well as I could,’ he said. ‘I like to set high standards for myself so I tried different ways to address why it just wouldn’t click for me as it had done at the start of the season. ‘But then I realised I’m still young and maybe that’s just something that’s going to happen, a dip in form. ‘I tried to do work in the gym on the physical side of things to try and help me counteract what I was coming up against. I also looked at whether it was a tactical or mental thing. ‘I came to the conclusion that I was getting man-marked more, so that was down to the tactical side learning how to deal with it. There was the physical side as well, so there were a few reasons I found. ‘I’m still addressing some of them. I’m doing a lot of work and as far as international football goes, the physical side is really important. So I still need to improve on that.’ He’s not the finished article yet and admits it. Still, Gordon Strachan asked him along for the double header with Georgia and Poland to form an opinion of just how close he is. Ryan Gauld in action for Scotland's Under 19 team before being called up to the senior side . Left-back Andrew Robertson, Gauld’s former Tannadice teammate, is playing first team football in the English Premiership with Hull and looks destined to spend the next 10 years as Scotland’s left-back. Gauld’s inclusion in either of the two games coming up would be a surprise. Yet, he insisted: ‘If I’m picked I’ll be ready. We’ve prepared the whole week for this. ‘I’ve dreamed about a Scotland call-up for a long time so I feel that I’m ready. ‘At the end of the day you don’t know when a chance like this will come for you again so you have to make the most of it. ‘All the senior players have been brilliant with me this week. Someone like Darren Fletcher has played at the highest level, Scott Brown has played in the Champions League too. It’s great to have players like them around.’ He expected a bit of ribbing. Some ‘baby Messi’ chat has been spared so far. ‘No-one in the Scotland squad has said anything about it yet - which I’m quite glad about,’ Gauld said. ‘I thought something might have been said. There’s been no initiation ceremony yet either. I’ve not had to sing a song or anything like that. I wouldn’t look forward to that.’","Starlet Ryan Gauld joined Sporting Lisbon for £3m in the summer .

Played a peach of a through ball to Adebayor which the striker should have done better with but not his best game. Emmanuel Adebayor – 5 . The captain’s first and final notable contribution to the game was a petulant hand in the face of teenager Louis Reed in the 16th minute for which he was lucky to just get a yellow card.

"Ryan Gauld is hoping to emulate his former Dundee United team-mate Andrew Robertson by training his way to a Scotland cap. Gauld, along with Stevie May, are the only new faces in Gordon Strachan's squad for the European Championship qualifying double-header against Georgia and Poland. The 18-year-old signed for Sporting Lisbon in the summer while ex-flatmate Robertson, 20, moved to Premier League side Hull City in a £2.85million move, thus completing his meteoric rise in the game. Ryan Gauld says he is aiming to train his way into Scotland boss Gordon Strachan's plans . Soon after moving from amateur outfit Queen's Park to United in the summer of 2013, Robertson was capped at Scotland under-21 level. Strachan was so impressed when he occasionally borrowed him for training sessions with the senior team that he handed the left-back his debut as a substitute in the away friendly against Poland in March and he is now an established squad member. Gauld has yet to make a start for his new club and has only recently forced his way in to the under-21 squad but Strachan's assistant, Mark McGhee, hinted that impressive performances in training this week could go a long way to boost his chances of a senior debut. Gauld was called up to the Scotland squad by boss Gordon Strachan for this month's Euro 2016 qualifiers . Speaking at the Scottish FA's Performance School Festival at Toryglen in Glasgow, the attacking midfielder said: . 'It is huge encouragement. It showed with the likes of Andy Robertson, the first time he did really well in training. 'He managed to come off the bench against Poland to make his debut and he hasn't looked back since then. 'I think it shows that if you get off to the right start and make a positive contribution, it can only stand you in good stead. Hull City's Andrew Robertson impressed Strachan after training with the senior Scotland side . 'It is great to play along top players (in training), it is a great opportunity to be able to do that.' Gauld joked that Robertson has already pulled rank. 'He is telling me that he is one of the experienced heads now so I have to listen to him,' he said. 'Obviously he is great to have around, he is a great friend of mine so to have a well-known face around me is good.' Scotland's second Group D fixture - they lost 2-1 away to Germany last month - is against the Georgians at Ibrox on Saturday, followed by a trip to Warsaw for the game against Poland the following Tuesday night. Gauld joined Portuguese club Sporting Lisbon from Dundee United this summer for  £3million . Gauld believes he is ready to make the 'huge step' up to Strachan's side. 'I have had a good start to the season and I think I am ready to go in if called upon,' said the Scotland Under-21 player who claims his move to Portugal has allowed him to 'develop further my technical abilities and also my tactical side of the game'. 'We are spending the whole week preparing for a couple of big games and everyone has got to be ready in case they are called upon. Ryan Gauld in action for Scotland's Under 19 team before being called up to the senior side . 'It would the best thing to happen to me. As a young kid, everyone watches the Scotland games whenever they are on so to be involved would be out of this world. 'It is a huge step up, you can see that from the training but with a little time in the training and getting to know everybody that is only going to help me. 'The manager said he wanted to get to know me and not to be afraid to do everything I can, and enjoy myself. 'It has been a great experience for myself and Stevie, something that we will both remember and learn from as well.'","Andrew Robertson impressed Gordon Strachan in training .

"Being substituted before the hour and having a whole stadium boo you as you go off does not usually bring a smile to a player’s face but Fernando Torres could not stop himself from grinning on Thursday night. It was the same smile he wore when he spoke after the game about the moment he was hooked after 57 minutes and 80,000 Real Madrid fans let their feelings towards him known. They had taunted him for years because he had only ever scored one goal against them now they were upset because he had just dumped them out of the Copa del Rey. ‘It was the smile of satisfaction at having done my job,’ he said as he left the Santiago Bernabeu feeling better about his career than he has since his Liverpool days. Torres is back finding the net after struggling to do so at Stamford Bridge and the San Siro and he is not the first striker to benefit from a spell at the Vicente Calderon. Fernando Torres celebrates opening the scoring for Atletico Madrid after just 49 seconds at the Bernabeu . Torres (left) is congratulated by team-mates after scoring in the first minute against Real Madrid . Arda Turan posted a picture oof Torres and his Atletico team-mates celebrating in the visitors' dressing room . Another who rose from the ashes in Spain after suffering in the Premier League was Diego Forlan. After only scoring 10 goals at Manchester United in 63 games he moved to Villarreal and won the Golden Shoe twice. The second of those European top scorer awards was won while at Atletico Madrid where Forlan also won the Europa League in 2010 and went off to the World Cup in such good form that he came back with the Golden Ball awarded the tournament’s best player. If the Vicente Calderon is not resuscitating failing careers it’s serving to maximise the potential of others that have just begun. Sergio Aguero was only 17 when club director Miguel Angel Gil flew with then Sporting Director Toni Munoz to Buenos Aires to sign the boy they believed would be the next big thing for 23m euros (£17.5m). Five years later they were selling him for 45m euros (£34.3m) to Manchester City. Torres enjoyed a slice of good fortune as keeper Keylor Navas deflected the ball into the net . Sergio Aguero was signed by Atletico for £17m and later sold to Manchester City for double that price . Like Torres, Diego Forlan struggled to score in the Premier League, but found his form at Atletico . And no sooner was Kun gone from Atletico Madrid than Radamel Falcao stepped in. He in turn was replaced by Diego Costa who this season has been replaced by Mario Mandzukic and Antoine Griezmann with the latter looking like he will fulfil his potential just as Aguero and Falcao did and the former putting his career back on track after a tumultuous last season at Bayern Munich under Pep Guardiola. Atletico Madrid is where good young strikers go to become great and to save a dying career there really is no place like the Vicente Calderon. For Torres, there really is no place like home. He has now scored two goals against Real Madrid in a week. That is two more than he scored against them in six years in his previous spell. Little wonder despite having been taken off early on Thursday night, he couldn’t stop smiling. After Forlan and Aguero, Radamel Falcao became the club's main striker, helping them win the Europa League . Diego Costa blossomed last season, helping them win La Liga and reach the Champions League final . Croatian forward Mario Mandzukic joined the club from Bayern Munich in the summer .","Fernando Torres made his name at Atletico Madrid as a youngster .
And now he has returned to the club after a difficult period in his career .
The club have a good record of getting the best out of strikers .
Sergio Aguero, Radamel Falcao, Diego Costa and Diego Forlan prove that ."
"Fernando Torres has a smile back on his face after silencing his critics by scoring two goals against Real Madrid to send Atletico Madrid through to the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey. The Spaniard, who begun his career at the Vicente Calderon with Atletico, had also never scored at the Bernabeu against their fierce rivals Real before the cup tie on Thursday night. Torres struck twice in the first minutes of each half to put his boyhood club through to the last eight with a 4-2 aggregate win, and the victory certainly pleased the striker.

'The fact that we scored so early meant we could play the game we wanted,' added the former Liverpool and Chelsea forward. 'We never felt the tie was in danger and we weren't under stress.' Both Sergio Ramos and Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo scored to cancel out Torres' goals, but the European champions were already heading out after their 2-0 defeat at the Vicente Calderon meant they needed three goals to go through. The win extended Atletico's record to five unbeaten against Real this season and sets Diego Simeone's team up with a quarter-final clash with Barcelona.

"Following Fernando Torres's two-goal heroics that helped Atletico Madrid knock rivals Real out of the Copa del Rey on Thursday night, the striker is still grabbing the headlines in the Spanish press. The former Chelsea striker signed for his boyhood club on loan earlier this month immediately after joining AC Milan on a permanent transfer and scored his first goals during his second spell in the red and white of Atleti. Madrid-based paper Marca led with Torres and the headline 'Look what you've caused, kid' after his performance midweek has his name on everyone's lips. Madrid paper Marca leads with Fernando Torres and the reaction to his two-goal performance against Real . Pep Guardiola claims Torres is perfect for Atletico, while team-mates Diego Godin and Juanfran lavish praise on the 30-year-old, with the latter insisting he is one of the best players in the world. Reaction to Torres  also features on the front page of AS, as they insist he has won the respect of the world press, but the paper leads with Real Madrid midfielder Isco. The headline describes him as the 'leader' in Carlo Ancleotti's team and syas he is 'the only player who has maintained his form and the Bernabeu bows down to his football'. Isco has played every minute for Los Blancos in 2015 and AS claim Ancelotti has complete faith in the midfielder. AS praise 'Isco the leader' insisting he is the only Real Madrid player to maintain his form . Mundo Deportivo lead with an exclusive interview with former Barcelona defender Eric Abidal as the Frenchman calls for 'unity' among the Catalan club amid rumours of unrest between coach Luis Enrique and some of the senior players. Abidal retired from football in December after spending the first half of the season playing for Olympiacos in Greece and has suggested he would be keen to return to Barcelona in some capacity. In the interview he said he is motivated to work with the Barca kids because they are the future and the life of the club. Former Barcelona defender Eric Abidal gave an exclusive interview to Spanish paper Deportivo Mundo . In Italy, Corriere dello Sport leads with the news that Premier League players Samuel Etot'o and Suso have both finalised transfers to Serie A. The deal to take Suso to AC Milan was confirmed by Liverpool on Saturday morning, and the paper reports that Eto'o's  will complete a switch from Everton to Samdoria and sign a contract until 2017.

"Neither Cameroon nor Mali could take advantage of the Ivory Coast’s slip-up against Guinea and go top of Group D of the Africa Cup of Nations, as the sides played out the tournament’s fifth 1-1 draw in the first eight games. Ambroise Oyongo’s late equalizer denied Mali all three points, cancelling out Sambou Yatabere’s opener, and leaving all four teams level after the first round of matches. In a game of few chances but plenty of heavy tackling it was always likely to take a set-piece or a defensive error to break the deadlock – in the end, the opening goal had an element of both.

Mali's Bakary Sako - who plays for Wolverhampton Wanderers - heads the ball towards goal . Benjamin Moukandjo of Cameroon (right) is challenged by Mali's Yacouba Sylla in the feisty encounter . When a deep free kick was pumped into the box, not only did the Cameroon defence fail to deal with it first time, but they also allowed Yatabare an incredible amount of time and space at the far post to collect the second ball. The Guingamp winger stayed calm, brought the ball down with his chest, before smashing it past Joseph Ondoa. But despite keeping Cameroon at arm’s length for the vast majority of the game, Mali could not hold on for the win, as Raoul Loe’s superb pass six minutes from time split the defence, and Ovongo finished coolly past Soumaila Diakite. Mali thought they had a winner, and Yatabare his second, when he headed home the rebound from Seydou Keita’s stoppage time free kick, but he was rightly adjudged to be offside. Aboubakar Vincent  is challenged by Mali's Molla Wague (left) as the game became a heated affair . For the fourth day in a row the stadium – this time a 35,000-seater in Equatorial Guinea’s capital Malabo - was not just full to capacity but packed well beyond, and a raucus atmosphere helped to make up for a disappointing lack of quality in attacking areas. Cameroon enjoyed most of the possession in the early stages, but it was Mali who had more clear-cut chances throughout. Wolves winger Bakary Sako was always a threat, his combination of pace and power giving Cameroon full back Abroise Oyongo a torrid time. Franck Kom of Cameroon and Mali's Seydou Keita (left) go head-to-head as both teams searched for a winner . It was Sako who had the game’s first chance, exchanging passes with Adamba Tamboura before Sako bursting into the box and forcing a good save from keeper with a powerful shot. From the resultant corner Mustapha Yatabare should really have made it 1-0, meeting a cross at the back post but heading wide from close range. The Wolves man, one of very few to run purposefully in a game full of lateral passes, also forced Ondoa into a good save at his near post after powering past Oyongo again, but he might have been better served picking out Mustapha Yatabare in the centre. Cameroon captain Eric Choupo-Mpong saw a powerful header tipped over by Soumaila Diakite in the first half, while Porto forward Vincent Aboubakar dragged a shot across the face of goal in the second, but for the most part Cameroon, unbeaten in qualifying, produced very little going forward until Oyongo’s dramatic equalizer.","Mali midfielder Sambou Yatabare scored the opening goal of the game .

"Theo Walcott believes the Arsenal forward line could turn out to be the best in the club's history - but they must prove exactly how good they are by winning plenty of silverware. The 25-year-old, who missed the vast majority of 2014 through injury, believes the current crop - which includes Alexis Sanchez, Olivier Giroud, Santi Cazorla and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain - can top that of the Invincibles' line-up which included most notably Thierry Henry and Dennis Bergkamp.

'When we go and achieve a little bit more than winning the FA Cup, then I think we can stand up and say this is the best attacking line up we've ever had.' After a below-par beginning to the season by their standards, Arsene Wenger's side have been much-improved of late, losing just once in eight previous outings. And that was clear for all to see on Sunday as they produced a sterling display at the home of the champions, Manchester City, running out 2-0 winners. Walcott has also lavished praise on Arsenal's star performer so far this term, that being Chilean forward Sanchez. The Arsenal Invincibles squad celebrate winning the Premier League title at White Hart Lane in April 2004 . He added: 'You see somebody working so hard and it makes you want to try to back him up. 'When you see what he does off the pitch, behind the scenes at the training ground, and how much work he puts in, all the players just stand up and think: Yeah, I need to do a bit more as well then.'

"Manchester United's £750million kit deal with adidas means nobody is off limits this summer - and that includes Lionel Messi. Louis van Gaal is expected to go on another spending spree after splashing out £156m when he arrived at Old Trafford. And with cash from the world-record deal with the German sportswear giants set to drop into the club accounts after the end of this season, money is no object. Manchester United's new kit deal with adidas means nobody is off limits this summer - including Lionel Messi . Manchester United will end their 13-year deal with Nike at the end of the current campaign . Louis van Gaal is expected to go on another spending spree in the summer . A source close to the 10-year agreement told Sportsmail: 'It's no secret that after this, nobody is off limits'. Messi, 27, hinted that he may leave Barcelona when he was named runner-up to Cristiano Ronaldo at the Ballon d'Or in Zurich, stating: 'I don’t know where I’ll be next year.' Reports in Spain had claimed adidas, who sponsor the man who has won the award four times himself, would help fund a £200m move. That is unlikely. Decisions over recruitment are solely the domain of the club and Messi has played for the Nike-sponsored Catalan giants throughout his career without conflict. Messi has been linked with a move away from Barcelona after unrest at board level . An picture is doing the rounds on Twitter which is supposed to be a leaked image of the new United shirt . However, the source said that United's agreement with adidas may well make them an attractive proposition for the Argentina star. 'It certainly would not hinder it,' they added. Old Trafford is seen as the only possible destination should Messi end an emotional 14-year stay at the Nou Camp. United are arguably the only club that can match Real Madrid's financial muscle and a switch to Barcelona's deadly rivals is unthinkable. Van Gaal spent a record £57.9million on former Real Madrid winger Angel di Maria (left) Both Manchester City and Chelsea are restricted by UEFA's Financial Fair Play restrictions while there are no such issues for United chief executive Ed Woodward. However, it is understood that senior officials at the Etihad Stadium believe that nobody would be able to prise Messi away from Barcelona until the latter stages of his career. The player is at home in Catalonia and is thought to be reluctant to leave such a settled environment behind. Old Trafford is seen as the only possible destination should Messi end his Barcelona career . The Old Trafford club failed in a huge bid for Gareth Bale in 2013 before he moved to Real Madrid . United, who spent £57.9m on Angel di Maria to break the UK record in the summer, failed in a huge bid for Gareth Bale in 2013 when the Spurs winger opted to go to boyhood idols Real Madrid for a world-record £85m. Despite not qualifying for the Champions League, United made £8.9m in the first quarter of the financial year and continue to sign new commercial deals across the globe. On Tuesday, they announced an agreement with KamaGames - who joined a long list of partners by becoming United's social games partner - and when money from adidas lands they are expected to hit a new level of financial power. Real Madrid - Real’s agreement with adidas, which runs until 2020, was widely reported to be the most lucrative in world football before United announced their deal with the same firm. Barcelona - Barcelona announced in 2007 that their deal with Nike, initially signed in 2006, was being extended until the end of the 2017-18 season. The original contract was worth a minimum of £24million a year. Arsenal - This is the first season of Arsenal’s deal with Puma, which was announced in January as the biggest contract in both parties’ history. Chelsea - Chelsea and adidas signed a 10-year deal last June worth almost £300million. Man City - City switched from local firm Umbro to Nike last season in a six-year deal announced in May 2012. Liverpool - In January 2012, Liverpool announced a six-year agreement with American firm Warrior. The deal is reportedly worth £25million a year to the Reds. Warrior general manager Richard Wright said at the time: 'We are here to shake up the world of football.' Bayern Munich - Bayern Munich and adidas extended their collaboration beyond the 50-year mark with a new deal in 2011 that runs until 2020. Adidas also owns a stake in the club. England - The Football Association ended a 60-year association with Umbro by switching to Nike. A five-year deal to run from 2013 to 2018 was announced in September 2012. The figure was not made public but the FA described it as 'a substantial investment'.' NFL - Nike replaced Reebok as the official supplier of kit to the National Football League in 2012 in a five-year deal that is the most lucrative in US sport.","Louis van Gaal is set to spend following Manchester United's £750m deal .

"Arsenal remain in talks with Villarreal defender Gabriel Paulista over a possible £10million move with Arsene Wenger on course to sign a centre-half in the January window.

"West Ham have approached Arsenal about making Carl Jenkinson's move a permanent one and been quoted a whopping £12million. The England Under 21 international is on a season-long loan at Upton Park and has impressed manager Sam Allardyce with his performances and attitude but a permanent deal will be difficult to seal at that price. The 22-year-old has made 20 appearances already this season as opposed to 22 in the whole of the last campaign with Arsenal and last month underlined how he has developed under Allardyce. Arsenal defender Carl Jenkinson has been in impressive form since joining the Hammers on loan . Jenkinson, pictured with Stewart Downing, joined West Ham on a season-long loan deal . 'I didn’t want to have another season sitting on the bench,' Jenkinson said. 'It was starting to drive me up the wall a little bit, I wanted to get out and play football, and I’ve realised that I’m happiest when I’m playing regular football. 'I didn’t want to go on loan to a team that was just going to kick the ball long. I wanted to go to a team where I was going to learn and improve and I think I’m definitely doing that here at West Ham. 'We focus on defending in training and we do a lot of work on one-v-ones and heading and I feel I’ve developed in those areas. He’s given me the licence to get forward and express myself. I know what I’m capable of.' Allardyce believes two or three extra additions will shape his squad into regular top-six contenders and the purchase of Jenkinson would not only be good continuity but prove a good investment for the future.

"Aaron Ramsey wants Arsenal to build on their impressive victory over Manchester City by going on a long unbeaten run. Arsenal pulled off one of the most impressive results of the season on Sunday when they defeated City 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium. Arsene Wenger's team have a poor record against their top-four rivals, but the Gunners rarely looked in trouble during their trip to the north west and the result means they remain within one point of fourth place. Aaron Ramsey has urged his team-mates to build on their impressive 2-0 win at Manchester City . Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud celebrates scoring against Manchester City . Ramsey battles for possession with City captain Vincent Kompany . Arsenal would be much higher in the table had they performed more consistently this season. The Gunners have not won more than two successive Barclays Premier League games this season, but Ramsey hopes that will now change in light of Sunday's victory over the champions. 'We have got a lot to play for this year so hopefully now we can build on this performance and that will give us even more confidence going into the business end of the season,' the Arsenal midfielder said. 'There is still a long way to go in this league. Many teams are taking points off each other. We will just have to concentrate on our own game and hopefully go on a big run and see where that takes us at the end. 'It was important to win because all the other teams won. The pressure was on us. 'Manchester City have made this place a fortress over the years. Not many teams come away with three points so we are delighted with the way we went about it and we are happy we closed the gap.' Giroud surges forward past Kompany (right) and Fernando (left) Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez dribbles with the ball . Sergio Aguero jostles with Kieran Gibbs on Sunday . Sunday's win was the first time Wenger had beaten City in the league since April 2012. The Gunners have failed to beat Chelsea in just over three years and they have only beaten Manchester United once since 2008. Arsenal's ability to open up the top teams in the country has never been in doubt. Last year they scored three times at the Etihad Stadium, but on Sunday they also matched that attacking verve with solid, disciplined defending. Giroud heads  past City keeper Joe Hart to make it 2-0 to Arsenal . Santi Carzola celebrates with Giroud after scoring his side's opening goal from the penalty spot . Ramsey hopes Arsenal's defence will grow in confidence as a result of the win. 'It was important to [get a win away from home against a big team],' the Welshman said. 'We have always been confident coming into these games but we have been a bit too open in the past and we have paid the price for that. 'On Sunday, we defended really well. We kept our team shape tight defensively and we took our chances when we needed to. 'We have shown what we are capable of doing. We are going to have chances in games. 'We are a team that can always create opportunities to score so the important thing is to defend as a team and stop them from scoring because we are always going to get opportunities to score. 'So if we can keep a clean sheet like we did yesterday, we are always going to have a chance to win.' Sanchez sets off on a mazy run through City's defence . Surprisingly, no one personified that defensive solidity more than Francis Coquelin, who kept City star David Silva in check all match. Coquelin has made only 13 Premier League starts in his Arsenal career and just last month he was on loan at Sky Bet Championship side Charlton. But Ramsey thinks Coquelin is now starting to show why Wenger recruited him as a 17-year-old. Francis Coquelin was able to keep Manchester City playmaker David Silva quiet . 'He's at that age now where he understands the game a lot more and he has done really well in the last few weeks,' Ramsey said of the 23-year-old, who has also had loan spells at Lorient and Freiburg. 'It's funny how quickly things can change in football. 'One week he was on loan at Charlton and then he comes back in and he has been in the team every week. He has done a very good job defensively for the team. 'He wins it back, keeps it simple and just keeps things ticking over. 'Hopefully he can build on his performances that he has been showing of late and he has got every chance of turning into a top defensive midfielder.'

"Arsenal broke the habit of a lifetime on Sunday, winning an away game against one of their top-four rivals. Their 2-0 win over Manchester City could well be a watershed moment in the Gunners' stuttering season. But what was different about Arsene Wenger's side at the Etihad Stadium and what lessons can they learn going into future clashes against their direct rivals? Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger got his side's tactics spot on as they won 2-0 away at Manchester City . 1) DISCIPLINE AND CONCENTRATION . Throwing away leads in search of more goals has been an unwanted characteristic of Arsenal's season so far. Conceding a 3-0 lead against Anderlecht in the Champions League has been one of the low-lights of their campaign. But there was no gung-ho approach against City. Having taken the lead through Santi Cazorla's penalty, the Gunners were much more conservative, remaining compact, not trying to stretch the game as they stifled City's attack. Santi Cazorla's first half penalty gave Arsenal a platform to build upon in Sunday's 2-0 win at the Etihad . The diminutive Spain international (left) celebrates his opener with Olivier Giroud (centre) and Alexis Sanchez . 2) KILLING THE GAME . It's not, perhaps, in keeping with Arsenal's attacking mantra but they showed guile and know-how of getting over the line at the Etihad. Time wasting in the corners, passing the ball sideways and backwards all wastes valuable seconds when you are ahead in a game. We don't usually see Arsenal lower themselves to that sort of thing. But they did on Sunday and came away with the best win of the season so far. Lesson learned. Arsenal's second goalscorer  Giroud (centre) held the ball up well as the visitors closed the game out . 3) FRANCIS COQUELIN - MIDFIELD ENFORCER . Arsenal have been crying out for an out-and-out defensive midfielder all season. It looks like they have found one in Coquelin. The young Frenchman was instrumental against City. Breaking up play in midfield and passing the ball to those who can do damage. Whether Coquelin is the answer to the Gunners midfield conundrum in the long term remains to be seen. But, for the time being, Wenger looks to have the midfield enforcer he has been desperate for. Francis Coquelin (centre) had an excellent game in midfield for the Gunners protecting the defence . 4) MIXING IT UP . We all know Arsenal can pass the ball as well as most teams in Europe, but they showed a different side to their game on Sunday. Goalkeeper David Ospina's long balls into centre forward Olivier Giroud was a feature of the Gunners' game plan. Is it a shame Wenger's side were forced to part with their passing principles? Perhaps. But Arsenal supporters certainly won't be concerned about that this morning. David Ospina's (left) long balls into Giroud were one asset of an astute tactical plan deployed by Arsenal . 5) HAPPY NOT TO HAVE THE BALL . Arsenal are most comfortable with the ball at their feet; when they dictating play. But on Sunday they had just 35 per cent of possession - but came away with a 2-0 win. Figure that one out? You don't always have to control the pace of a game to win it, as the Gunners proved as they stifled City's attack. They showed efficiency in their counter-attacks against Manuel Pellegrini's side. They had three shots on target - two of which were goals. Gunners used the counter-attack to good effect against City - with Sanchez (left) a key weapon on the break .","Arsenal won 2-0 away at Manchester City in the Premier League on Sunday .

"The Scottish Rugby Union has declared a willingness to stage international football matches at BT Murrayfield if a decision is taken to quit Hampden. The Scottish Football Association’s current lease on the national stadium in Mount Florida expires in 2020. Speaking last summer, SFA chief executive Stewart Regan admitted they had to ‘explore all options’ but stressed that Hampden remained a ‘key pillar’ of football in this country. Scottish Rugby Union has declared a willingness to stage international football matches at Murrayfield . Work will be done on the stadium prior to it hosting Euro 2020 matches but there remains a question mark over whether a wider — and more costly — revamp will be undertaken. It is possible Scotland games could instead be taken on the road around various venues after 2020, with SRU chief executive Mark Dodson now offering the use of the 67,000-capacity Murrayfield. The home of Scottish rugby hosted two of Celtic’s Champions League qualifiers while Parkhead was on Commonwealth Games duty last summer. Dodson is keen to trim the SRU’s £11million debt and potentially gaining rental income from the SFA carries significant financial attraction. The Murrayfield pitch has recently been replaced by a £1.25m hybrid surface . ‘We hosted Glasgow Celtic when they couldn’t use their own ground during the Commonwealth Games, so we’re open to the idea of football being played here,’ said Dodson. ‘We haven’t had any official conversations with the SFA but clearly if there is a desire from them to come and play at Murrayfield then we would happily listen to whatever proposal they put forward. ‘I do think the issue in Scotland is that we have got too many big stadiums and not enough small ones. ‘So it is difficult to make all of the bigger ones financially viable. ‘If you have any kind of stadium — indoor or outdoor — it is the number of dark nights that are the problem and you need to use it as much as you possibly can. The SFA are exploring all options with regard to hosting of Scotland matches . ‘Something like Murrayfield is such an expensive building to maintain so to have it empty is not what you want. So we’re always thinking of ways to improve the Murrayfield estate so it becomes a better and more viable financial option for us.’ The SFA declined to comment but there would likely be significant resistance from within Scottish football to any thought of money flowing out to rugby. A consultancy firm has been engaged by the SFA to fully evaluate a number of options in relation to their future at Hampden, but that process remains in its early stages with five years still to go on the existing lease.","Hampden set for revamp for hosting Euro 2020 matches .

"Jimmy Walker defended his Sony Open crown in style at the Waialae Country Club on Sunday as he finished with a massive nine-shot margin over the rest of the field. The 36-year-old, who lost out in a playoff at the Hyundai Tournament of Champions in Maui last week, was in determined mood as he carded a seven-under 63 to claim his fourth PGA Tour title. After a fine 62 on Saturday he had an overnight lead of two shots, but this increased to six as a hat-trick of birdies on the eighth, ninth and 10th holes took him to 19 under. Jimmy Walker poses with the trophy after winning the 2015 Sony Open in Hawaii at the Waialae Country Club . Walker and wife Erin pose with the trophy in Honolulu . It would have been easy for Walker to relax a little at that point, safe in the knowledge no-one was going to catch him, but he racked up four more birdies, including a smooth 20-foot putt on the 12th hole. Walker, who finished on 23 under, highlighted how last week's near miss was in his thinking as he refused to let up and recorded the biggest victory in Sony Open history. 'It's quite a bit different (to last week). I really wanted to try to finish out the day today like I kind of didn't do last week and it was really fun,' he told Sky Sports 4. 'The wind picked up this afternoon, it was tough, it played tough, and I just kept grinding, having good shots, putts and that's what I wanted to do today.'

Scott Piercy notched a second 66 in two days to rise six places into a distant second, while Matt Kuchar's streak of 255 consecutive rounds with a birdie ended on Sunday. Kuchar, who had shared the lead going into the third day, finished with a one-over 71 as he drifted out to T3 alongside Gary Woodland and Harris English. Englishman Brian Davis joined a six-strong group a shot further back on 12 under as he hit four birdies and a bogey on his way to a fourth round 67. Davis was in good company as Justin Thomas, who equalled the course record with a nine-under 61 on Friday, was also at T6.","Jimmy Walker wins Sony Open by nine shots .

"Shaun Murphy's mum Jean and fiancee Elaine picked the right week to start watching him play. Murphy has been a professional snooker player for 17 years but they had never seen him compete live until now, breaking the habit of a lifetime to witness him complete a career ‘triple crown’ with a masterclass win over world No 1 Neil Robertson. ‘I’ve told them it’s not always like this,’ said Murphy after sealing a 10-2 victory to take the Masters title at London’s Alexandra Palace. Shaun Murphy poses with the 2015 Masters title after thrashing Neil Robertson 10-2 in the final on Sunday . The 32-year-old became only the 10th man in history to win the World, Masters and UK championships after the most commanding performance at this event since Steve Davis beat Mike Hallett 9-0 in the 1998 final. It is a decade since Murphy won the World Championship. He added a UK title in 2008 but despite being one of the most naturally talented ball strikers, this final piece of the puzzle had eluded him. ‘After winning the world title as a 22-year-old, I thought I’d blitz through these events, but I’ve had ups and downs,’ said Murphy. ‘This time last year I thought about walking away from snooker altogether.’ Robertson congratulates Murphy on his first Masters title after the emphatic 10-2 final at the Alexandra Palace . Murphy sits down in shock after cruising past Robertson in the Masters final to complete the Triple Crown . It was vital Robertson got off the mark quickly at the start of the second session but instead Murphy won the first frame. Murphy recorded his second century of the game with a superb 127 to extend his lead to 9-2 and put the title beyond Robertson. ‘I came to this event when I was 12. My dad asked if I felt I’d ever play in it and I said I’d love to. Winning it is unbelievable,’ said Murphy. The 32-year-old was playing inspired Snooker on Sunday to thrash Australian Neil Robertson 10-2 . Robertson failed to hit top form at the Alexandra Palace as Murphy powered to the Masters title . If he keeps playing like this he will be a major contender at the World Championship in May, and it was announced yesterday that the event will remain at The Crucible in Sheffield until at least 2017. Stephen Hendry, the record seven-time world champion, praised the decision. ‘I can’t imagine the World Championship anywhere else. It would just lack something, and it wouldn’t feel like the World Championship any more,’ he said. ‘It would be like taking the tennis away from Wimbledon. There is only one place truly to play snooker, and that is The Crucible.’","32-year-old cruised past the Australian 10-2 for his first Masters title .

"The Australian golfer who was allegedly abducted and robbed in Hawaii before being woken up by a homeless woman has compared his experience with the action film Taken. In an interview with the Seven Network on Monday morning, a battered and bruised Robert Allenby said the FBI are investigating the alleged incident. But the FBI denies that. 'The FBI is not investigating this matter whatsoever,' FBI Special Agent Tom Simon told Daily Mail Australia on Monday morning. 'A little bit of an American civics lesson - the FBI could only investigate a kidnapping if the victim was transferred interstate.' Scroll down for video . Battered and bruised: Allenby appeared on the Seven Network program this morning . Ordeal: Robert Allenby, right, gave an interview with David Koch on Sunrise this morning where he compared his kidnapping with sequences in the film Taken . Australian golfer Robert Allenby was kidnapped from a bar, robbed and beaten up in Hawaii . LIam Neeson: In the movie Taken, Neeson stars as a former spy desperate to save his daughter who had been sold off into sex slavery . But Mr Simon said he did not believe Allenby was lying about FBI involvement. 'I don't believe the golfer was lying. Here's what the confusion arose from. 'The head of security for the PGA in Hawaii who I believe spoke to the alleged victim is a retired FBI special agent. 'So I believe it was from that conversation that the golfer came to the erroneous but not illogical conclusion the FBI was looking into this field. Allenby was having dinner at the Amuse Wine Bar in Waikiki with his close friend Anthony Puntoriero on Friday night. As he left the restaurant, he believes he was drugged, robbed and beaten before being thrown in the boot of a car. On Sunrise this morning, Allenby said: 'I've watched Taken quite a few times. It kind of felt pretty much the same as that. Just very surreal, yeah.' The thriller flick features Liam Neeson playing a former spy who is trying to track down his biological daughter, who has been sold into sex slavery. Allenby said he paid the bill and when he came out of the bathroom he was told Mr Puntoriero had already gone downstairs. 'I walked around the corner and then bang,' he said. 'Next minute I was thrown out of the boot of the car. - which they call a trunk over here - just on to the side street.' Allenby said he had no recollection of his time spent in the boot as he had been knocked unconscious. Allenby, who has bruising and cuts to his nose and forehead, said he had no memory of the attack. 'I have no recollection of being in the boot of the car because I was knocked unconscious straight away,' Mr Allenby told the Seven Network. 'I still don't know if I was robbed before or after, but obviously everything I had in my possession was taken. The golfer said the police and FBI were currently working on the case, and it wasn't clear if the attack was targeted. In his son's corner: Robert Allenby appeared on Sunrise supported by his father, Don, who is pictured left . Allenby, 43, was in the country playing the Sony Open but missed the cut on Friday .

The Sony Open was held at the Waialae Country Club and Allenby was staying at the nearby Kahala Hotel . The Australian failed to make the cut after the first two days of play and was relaxing on Friday night . Born: 12 July, 1971 . Turned pro: 1992 . Joined PGA Tour: 1999 . Best major results: Equal seventh, U.S. Open (2004), The Open Championship (2008) Best Australian PGA result:2005 'triple crown', winning the Australian Masters, Open and PGA . Earnings: Allenby is 27th on the all-time list for the PGA Tour with $27,329,892 . But he said police had found that one of his credit cards was used in Waikiki on Sunday night. 'Whoever did it is definitely still around, still in town,' Allenby said . The four-time PGA Tour winner paid special tribute to a homeless woman who helped him as he was starting to be harassed by other homeless people after being dumped out of the car. The homeless woman got the bruised and beaten golfer away from the others, before a retired military officer also came to his aid. 'I was very fortunate, a homeless lady pretty much saved my life,' Allenby added. Scans have cleared Allenby of any serious facial or head injuries and he is hopeful of being cleared to fly in the next day or two. He doesn't yet know when he'll next hit the golf course. 'The chances of me playing next week are very slim, but I'm just taking it one day at a time.' 'Medically, I thankfully didn't suffer anything major beyond some bumps and bruises that will take a bit of time to heal,' Allenby said in a statement released by the PGA Tour on Sunday. 'My plan currently is to fly back to the mainland and at that point, evaluate my ability to play next week at the Humana Challenge. 'Whatever the outcome regarding my ability to play next week, I anticipate a successful rest of the 2014-15 PGA Tour season.' Allenby has noticeable damage and lacerations to his nose and forehead. He has told reporters the FBI and local police have some leads. 'We have some names and numbers and they have some leads to follow up, so I am confident they will get the guys,' Allenby said. 'With the FBI guys involved, they're the best, the guys on the tour are awesome, and they'll get to the bottom of it.' The 43-year-old had been drinking with caddy Mick Middlemo and friend Anthony Punteriero . Allenby was set to head back to the US on Saturday morning, but has stayed on to assist police . Maddlemo had been with Allenby earlier in the night . Allenby was most concerned about potentially not being able to call 13-year-old daughter Lily for her birthday, but scans have cleared him of any serious facial or head injuries and he is hopeful of being cleared to fly in the next day or two. 'She's really upset about it but at the end of the day it could have been a lot worse,' the Victorian said. 'I don't care about the money or my cards or anything like that. I am just glad I have survived this one.' After the incident, the Australian golfer was then returned to the Kahala Hotel where he had spent the week while playing at the Sony Open held at the nearby Waialae Country Club - where Allenby failed to make the cut after the first two days of play. His friend Anthony Puntoriero - who was with Allenby earlier on the night - confirmed he was kidnapped. 'He's all right now but we are still talking to detectives,' Puntoriero told AAP. Puntoriero and Allenby's caddy were not with the four-time PGA Tour winner at the moment of the abduction. Allenby was set to head back to the US on Saturday morning, but has stayed on to assist police with their investigations. He reportedly managed to piece together some of the night after being reunited with Puntoriero and his caddy, and CCTV footage from the wine bar is being reviewed in an attempt to identify the perpetrators. The 43-year-old has been a professional golfer since 1992, and while a consistent performer on the PGA Tour for 15 years he has never won a major tournament. Allenby's best result at a major was to finish equal seventh - which he achieved twice - at the 2004 U.S. Open and the 2008 Open Championship. He won Australia's 'triple crown' in 2005 - winning the Masters, Australian PGA and Australian Open. He's also been a regular in the Presidents Cup, representing the International team five times between 1993 and 2009.

"Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers will not jeopardise Daniel Sturridge’s efforts to recapture full fitness by rushing him back just to help his side reach Wembley. The England striker, who has not played for Liverpool since August 31, cleared the final hurdle in his rehabilitation yesterday when he began full training at the club’s Melwood base and he will again today. With the second leg of the Capital One Cup semi-final at Stamford Bridge looming, the temptation for Rodgers would be to unleash Sturridge. Liverpool showed in their draw with Bolton how much they need the striker and Chelsea could be vulnerable after being embarrassed by Bradford. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers is adamant the club will not rush Daniel Sturridge's injury return . Sturridge is reportedly in contention to play against West Ham for Liverpool next weekend . Bolton goalkeeper Adam Bogdan (left) kept Liverpool at bay with a string on impressive stops . Daniel Sturridge posted this image on to Instagram to celebrate his return to first team training . Liverpool are now unbeaten in their last eight games at Anfield: this draw, though, was their sixth stalemate in that sequence. Rodgers will consult Sturridge and the club’s medical staff over the next 24 hours and only then will he decide if the 25-year-old has a role to play tomorrow, or if he is held back for Saturday’s clash with West Ham. ‘The other players have shown (enough) in this period, in the last seven weeks,’ said Rodgers. ‘He (Sturridge) wants to be involved in the big games. But we have to be realistic and careful. Chelsea is a very important game. If he feels right to be involved in some part, then we will maybe look at it. But it is a big risk.’ Another of Liverpool’s striking options, Mario Balotelli, was left out of the squad against Bolton. Rodgers spent an hour talking with him at Melwood last week and has explained what he needs to do to get back into his plans. ‘Mario still has a contribution to make — which I think he will do,’ said Rodgers, whose side were repeatedly denied by Bolton keeper Adam Bogdan. ‘I have to assess the players every single day when I watch them. That is how I pick the squad.’ Rodgers had no concerns about the way Liverpool played and was full of compliments for Bolton.

I think we have a chance (in the replay).

In the Birmingham Mail there were suggestions that a millionaire from Azerbaijan may be interested in buying the club from Randy Lerner. Peculiarly, he didn't have a name. Former Villa striker Andy Gray revealed that he has been using his time working in Qatar to sell the prospects of the club to the wealthy in the Middle East. Aston Villa fans are upset with the way that owner Randy Lerner is running the club . 'But try as I might to encourage one of the sheikhs to invest, I find it difficult,' he lamented. In the Shakespeare pub near Birmingham New Street station, Villa fans seemed understandably unexcited. 'We need a new owner,' said Paul Wilkin from Solihull. 'More urgently than that, though, we need a new manager. Much more of this football and people will just stop going.' Saturday was another hard day for boss Paul Lambert. He was booed as Villa lost to Liverpool. The planned 'eight-minute' protest on the Holte End didn't happen but Lambert knows how people feel. 'We haven't scored for eight hours, have won 17 home games out of 67 and Lambert wonders why we are moaning,' said Jonathan Fear, of the Vital Villa website. 'We are a big club and going nowhere. I look at clubs like Southampton and ask myself: ""Why is that not us?""' Villa competed well with Liverpool for 20 minutes in the second half. That apart, though, Villa were poor. Paul Lambert (left) has seen his Aston Villa side go goalless for over eight hours now . Carlos Sanchez impressed, as did Fabian Delph for a spell and, sporadically, Christian Benteke. Those close to the club say the latter two players will leave in the summer while another well-placed source says Lerner has never recovered from the acrimonious nature of Martin O'Neill's departure in 2010 and suffers from never having appointed a man with football experience to the board. 'After Martin, Lerner appointed Gerard Houllier and then Alex McLeish,' said the source. 'The O'Neill thing almost paralysed him and he made two bad appointments that have cost the club time and a lot of money.' Fabian Delph was one of Villa's best players against Liverpool but could leave the club in the summer . For now Lambert is seen to be the problem and things may get worse. Next up in the Premier League are Arsenal and Chelsea. On the platform at Aston station on Saturday evening, two Liverpool fans asked if I supported Villa. 'You must do,' said one. 'You just look so fed up.'","There were boos at Villa Park after 2-0 defeat to Liverpool on Saturday .

"‘The other day, a coach of a big team was knocked out of the Cup and he was saying, “Very good, now we can focus on other competitions”. If I lose against Bradford I won’t say that. I say, “It’s a disgrace” ~ Jose Mourinho on Friday . Click here to read the full story . Jose Mourinho slammed ‘disgraceful’ Chelsea after they crashed to a humiliating defeat against Bradford City, as four of the Premier League’s top six crashed out of the FA Cup. The Blues boss admitted his side should be ‘ashamed’ after letting a 2-0 lead slip as they fell victim to a famous FA Cup giant-killing against the League One side. Eight-time winners Tottenham Hotspur were turned over 2-1 at home by Leicester and Premier League high-flyers Southampton lost 3-2 to visitors Crystal Palace. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho can't hide his frustration during the 4-2 defeat to Bradford on Saturday . Mourinho looks pensive on the Stamford Bridge touchline during the dramatic 4-2 loss to League One Bradford . Premier League champions Manchester City were stunned 2-0 at home by Middlesbrough to complete an unbelievable day of FA Cup drama. For Chelsea, the loss ends their hope of a quadruple and piles even more pressure on the club ahead of their Capital One Cup semi-final second-leg clash against Liverpool on Tuesday. ‘I feel ashamed, I think the players should feel exactly the same as I feel,’ said Mourinho. ‘I repeat the words I used yesterday in the press conference, if we lose, it is a disgrace. Is this one of my worst ever results? Yes. But this is the beauty of football, of the . FA Cup. In not many sports is it possible that the best team and the best players lose against a team with complete different potential. This is the beauty of the FA Cup. ‘In the history of this competition, this happens to every team now and again, for me it is the first time, for Chelsea it doesn’t happen a lot and it is unacceptable to lose against a team from a lower league. ‘If I was a you (a journalist), I would be very critical with Chelsea, with the manager and players. But the other team don’t deserve that we forget them and we focus on the negative Chelsea. They also deserve such an impressive result. I could find in my bad feeling with the game and with the result space to be happy for them.’ Bradford boss Phil Parkinson was unsurprisingly in better spirits than his Premier League counterparts. Bradford City manager Phil Parkinson is congratulated by Mourinho having masterminded a shock win . Chelsea's £200million men were sunk by a supermarket shelf stacker who was plucked from non-league obscurity for the princely sum of £7,500. James Hanson was the only member of the Bradford City squad at Stamford Bridge to have cost the club a fee when he joined the League One side from Guiseley in 2009. The rest of Phil Parkinson's parade of heroes were stitched together by a mixture of free transfers and low-key loan deals. In contrast the total cost of Jose Mourinho's shocked stars clanged the £200m mark. Even £99m of talent on the bench alone could not rescue Mourinho from the most embarrassing moment of his managerial career as the Bantams proved worth their weight in gold. CHELSEA .

The Bradford squad celebrate their famous FA Cup fourth round win at Stamford Bridge on Saturday . ‘It has put Bradford on the map again,’ he said. ‘It’s only slightly sinking in. When we were on the pitch celebrating at the end it did feel a bit surreal, that we’ve come to the league leaders and scored four goals. ‘It’s a great feeling and will be remembered in Bradford for a long time but the rest of the country as well.’ Mourinho left key men Nemanja Matic, Diego Costa and Branislav Ivanovic out the squad, while Cesc Fabregas, Eden Hazard and John Terry were on the bench. But the Portuguese said: ‘The team I selected is a good team and the only player that came from the youth team is Andreas Christensen, he did well. ‘We didn’t lose because of Christensen. The kid did his job very well. The other players have to be ready to play for Chelsea, ready to play any game. ‘If they cannot play against a team from the Championship, League One or League Two, what do we do? ‘It is the same team that played against Watford in the last round and we won. The players that played — we are not speaking about a team of kids. I think the selection was good enough, more than good enough.’ Mourinho insisted Andre Schurrle’s omission from the match-day squad was down to a back injury. The German has been linked with a move away from Stamford Bridge before the transfer deadline and his no-show  fuelled talk of an imminent switch.

'Well for that money, all you can be sure of is he must be bloody good! It’s a gamble but Real Madrid are no fools. They will see the wages as a big part of the overall cost of buying somebody so young. Every now and then a player from around the world comes to the fore and their age doesn’t seem to matter.

"Cian Healy and Sean O'Brien moved a step closer towards Six Nations action after being named in Ireland's 46-man training squad. Ireland head coach Joe Schmidt selected the Leinster duo in his wider Six Nations squad despite both still battling long-term injuries. Schmidt's decision not to send the influential forward pair back to Leinster to continue their recovery increases their chances of turning out for the Irish Wolfhounds' clash with England Saxons on Friday, January 30. Leinster's Cian Healy has been named in Ireland 46-man Six Nations training squad . Fit-again Connacht prop Nathan White and Leinster back-rower Jack Conan are the only uncapped members of Schmidt's squad. 'The coaching group have tried to strike a balance between some players getting the chance to fully complete their rehabilitation programmes, or get a bit of rest, and others getting the opportunity to push their claims with further game time in the Wolfhounds fixture,' said boss Schmidt. Injury doubts remain over Johnny Sexton, Conor Murray and Robbie Henshaw, but all three have been included in the extended squad. Racing Metro fly-half Sexton could miss the first two rounds of fixtures while he completes a 12-week lay-off after suffering four concussions in 12 months. Sean O'Brien has also been named in the squad despite suffering from a long-term injury . Munster scrum-half Murray is carrying a disc problem in his neck but the severity of the issue remains unclear, while Henshaw is battling a 'low-grade' ankle ligament problem. Ireland open the defence of their Six Nations title by taking on Italy in Rome on Saturday, February 7, with a host of regular stars missing through injury. Chris Henry, Paddy Jackson, Stuart Olding, Dan Tuohy and Damien Varley have been excluded from the squad entirely and effectively ruled out of the tournament. Robin Copeland, Dave Kilcoyne, Luke Marshall, Donncha Ryan and Andrew Trimble have been told to stay with their provinces, but Ireland have reserved the right to bring them back into the squad if and when required. The decision to retain Healy and O'Brien underlines just how close both men are to making playing returns. Ireland head coach Joe Schmidt named two uncapped players in his training squad . Leinster decided against pitching one or other into action in Saturday's crucial Champions Cup trip to Wasps, before targeting the Pro12 clash against the Dragons on February 15 as a potential return fixture. Bullish flanker O'Brien has not featured for Ireland since damaging his shoulder in the 24-22 Test defeat to New Zealand in November 2013. The 27-year-old has had to undergo two successive operations on the same shoulder, but is finally nearing fitness. Ball-carrying prop Healy suffered a severe hamstring tear in September and has been grafting towards Six Nations fitness ever since. New Zealand-born prop White was in line to become Ireland's fourth-oldest debutant of all time in the autumn at 33, but ruptured an arm tendon and missed the November series. Injury doubts remain over Johnny Sexton (pictured), Conor Murray and Robbie Henshaw . FORWARDS: . M Bent (Leinster), R Best (Ulster), J Conan, S Cronin (both Leinster), J Cronin (Munster), R Diack (Ulster), D Foley (Munster), C Healy, J Heaslip (both Leinster), I Henderson, R Herring (both Ulster), M McCarthy, J McGrath, M Moore, J Murphy, S O'Brien (all Leinster), P O'Connell, T O'Donnell, P O'Mahony (all Munster), M Ross, R Ruddock, D Ryan, R Strauss, D Toner (all Leinster), N White (Connacht).

"Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League fixtures, as well as intriguing statistics from the Football League. 1. Santi Cazorla was unquestionably man of the match in Arsenal’s 2-0 win at Manchester City, but the Gunners’ unsung hero was centre-forward Olivier Giroud. The Frenchman’s work rate set the tone for his team, harrying City’s defenders and making himself available as an outlet when Arsenal broke. Giroud ran 7.4 miles, the furthest of any player on the Etihad Stadium pitch – and in marked contrast to opposing front man Sergio Aguero’s total of 5.8 miles. For good measure he also headed home the second goal that clinched the game – his seventh of an injury hit season in which he was starting for only the eighth time. Santi Cazorla put in an impressive performance for Arsenal on Sunday as they beat Manchester City 2-0 . Olivier Giroud ran 7.4 miles - the furthest of any player at the Etihad on Sunday during Arsenal's win . 2. West Ham will feel more and more confident of regularly selling the 54,000 seats in their new Olympic Stadium home. Sunday’s official gate of 34,914 for the 3-0 romp over Hull was just 102 below Upton Park’s official capacity, a significant crowd for a game that was live on TV and against one of the Premier League’s less glamorous clubs. The Hammers, who move to Stratford in 2016, have sold out all 11 of their Premier League home games so far. West Ham will feel more confident of regularly selling the 54,000 seats in their new Olympic Stadium home . Sportsmail examine the curious goings-on at Old Trafford since Van Gaal's arrival . 3. Angel Di Maria is unquestionably a brilliant wide man but he can’t play as a central striker in the way Louis van Gaal tried to use him in the first half at Queens Park Rangers. The slightly built Argentine didn’t have the strength to hold the ball up. He gave it away 22 times at Loftus Road and won only three of 14 duels against defenders. Angel Di Maria is unquestionably a brilliant wide man but can’t play as a central striker for Louis van Gaal . Louis van Gaal tried to use Di Maria as a central striker in the first half at Queens Park Rangers . 4. Southampton’s astonishing production line of academy talent never seems to stop producing players – the latest is 19-year-old Harrison Reed who helped manager Ronald Koeman make light of the absence of his key midfield pair Victor Wanyama and Morgan Schneiderlin. Worthing-born Reed gave the ball away only eight times in 90 minutes at Newcastle, and came out on top in every one of the four tackles he contested. It helped Koeman’s side wrap up three away wins in a week – taking them to 10 wins on their travels in all this season, the most the club have ever achieved in a Premier League campaign. Southampton's academy talent never seems to stop coming and 19-year-old Harrison Reed is the latest (left) 5. Aston Villa are hoping that new Spanish midfielder Carles Gil can provide the attacking verve from midfield they need – and that his debut was a sign of things to come. The 22-year-old livened up another drab Villa display after replacing Tom Cleverley with half an hour to go. In his time on the pitch he played more passes, won more tackles and made more chances than on-loan Manchester United and former England star Cleverley had managed in the previous 60 minutes. He also ran 2.8 miles – two thirds of the total distance covered in half the time compared to Cleverley. Aston Villa are hoping that new Spanish midfielder Carles Gil can provide the attacking prowess they crave . 6. Glenn Whelan, who celebrated his 31st birthday last week, is out of contract in the summer and has yet to agree a new deal at Stoke because the club prefer not to give more than 12 months to players in their thirties. The Republic of Ireland midfielder is making a strong case to be treated as an exception to the rule, though. He made the team tick in the 1-0 win at Leicester, completing more passes (64) than anybody else, with two thirds of them in the attacking half. Steven N’ Zonzi and Bojan were the only two Stoke players who ran further than his 6.9 miles. Glenn Whelan celebrated his 31st birthday but is out of contract in the summer with Stoke City . 7. Perhaps Whelan could give a call for some support to his Irish team-mate John O’Shea, who will be 34 in April but signed in October a contract that keeps him at Sunderland until the summer of 2017. The central defender is proof that age need be no barrier to playing in the Premier League. After Whelan’s team-mate Ryan Shawcross was ruled out by injury on Saturday, O’Shea is now the only top flight outfield player this season to have appeared for every minute of every game in every competition. Whelan could give a call for some support to his Irish team-mate John O’Shea (right), who turns 34 in April . 8. Welsh international midfielder Dave Edwards was one of the few players to survive the massive clearout undertaken by Kenny Jackett when he took over at Wolves – and is beginning to look a key figure in the club’s ambition to return to the Premier League. The 28-year-old scored his fourth goal in three games in the 2-0 win over Blackpool that moved the Molineux club to within a point of the Championship play-offs. Dave Edwards (left) was one of the few players to survive the massive clearout undertaken by Kenny Jackett . 9. Swindon, where manager Mark Cooper insists on expansive passing football, are establishing a reputation as the destination of choice for Premier League clubs to send their most promising youngsters for loan spells. The latest to arrive at the Country Ground is Chelsea’s 19-year-old John Swift, a Portsmouth born midfielder whose goal-scoring at youth level has led to him being dubbed the next Frank Lampard. He lived up to the reputation, scoring one and making another as the Robins beat Chesterfield 3-1 to stay top of the League One table. Chelsea’s 19-year-old John Swift has been dubbed the next Frank Lampard and arrived at Swindon on loan . 10. Cameron McGeehan is a name that Manchester United will need to be aware of before they arrive at Cambridge on Friday night for a potentially tricky FA Cup fourth round tie. The 19-year-old, who started out at Fulham and then Chelsea before being let go, has just signed for Richard Money’s team on a loan from his current club Norwich. The Northern Ireland Under 21 international has been cleared to play against Louis van Gaal’s side – and warmed up with two goals on his Abbey Stadium debut in a 4-0 romp against Newport.

"As Sportsmail continues its 'HANDS OFF IN THE BOX' campaign in an attempt to rid the game of grappling defenders and shirt-pulling in the area, we highlight the main talking points from Everton's match against West Brom on Monday night. Everton 0-0 West Brom . While Everton's home clash was rather uneventful in terms of goal-mouth action, there were still a number of talking points from the game. After Kevin Mirallas' penalty miss in the first half for the Toffees, the hosts should have had another in the second half after a clear foul on Everton striker Steven Naismith. The Scottish international appeared to be bundled down in the area by Baggies midfielder Claudio Yacob on 62 minutes. What made the incident even more bizarre was the fact the 27-year-old had been previously warned twice by referee Michael Oliver about making contact in the area. But despite those warnings he couldn't resist pulling back the forward again from the corner that followed, with Naismith falling into the West Brom goal - but no penalty was awarded. West Brom midfielder Claudio Yacob (left) clearly has both hands on Everton striker Steven Naismith (right) in the area . Yacob appears to make clear contact with Naismith inside the area just after the half mark at Goodison Park .

After the game manager Tony Pulis admitted the Argentina midfielder plays a similar role to that of Crystal Palace's midfield general Mile Jedinak - who starred under Pulis at Selhurst Park last season.

"Stanislas Wawrinka continued the defence of his Australian Open title with a comfortable third-round victory against Jarkko Nieminen on Saturday. Fourh seed Wawrinka, who won his maiden Grand Slam crown here at Melbourne Park last year, was too strong for world No 72 Jarkko Nieminen as the Swiss won 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 to progress to the last 16. While his compatriot Roger Federer crashed out the tournament on Friday, Wawrinka has progressed through the draw with relative ease, winning nine of nine sets played so far. Stanislas Wawrinka made short work of Jarkko Nieminen in their third round clash at the Australian Open . Wawrinka signs autographs and celebrates his victory as he remained on course to defend his title . Wawrinka said: 'I'm really happy with my game so far. I think today was a good match. It's been three really good matches. I think my game is there and I'm really happy to get through again.' The first set was tight with Nieminen staying with his higher-ranked opponent all the way until the pivotal moment when Wawrinka broke Nieminen's serve for the opening set with a forehand winner. Wawrinka was by far the more aggressive player - the total winners count ending 53-18 in his favour - and that raw power helped him ease to a two-set lead. Breaks were exchanged in the third set but with Nieminen serving to stay in the match, Wawrinka brought up three match points and he only needed one as the 33-year-old Finn was caught in no man's land in the middle of the court and netted with the forehand. Nieminen had his moments but struggled to cope with Wawrinka's strength over the three sets .","Stanislas Wawrinka looked impressive as he raced past Jarkko Nieminen .

"Just when things were heating up, three spectators were caught sneaking out early during an intense round four clash between Australia's young gun Nick Kyrgios and Andreas Seppi. As fans packed the Hisense Arena on day seven at the Australian Open, the Canberra teenager delivered an early Australia Day celebration on Sunday night at Melbourne Park. But the 19-year-old couldn't please everyone when three fans got up and tried to head for the exit as the tennis star went on to stage a miracle comeback after a five-set triumph. And in the heat of the moment, Kyrgios interrupted his own match as he called out at the fans: 'Oi! Where are you going?' as the crowd laughed. With the roaring crowd yelling out 'boo' at the three fans, they immediately seated themselves back down as they giggled and appeared humiliated. Scroll down for video .

After some pretty standard chit chat, former women's world number one Azarenka decided to get in on the action, and she didn't hold back. 'How can I learn to serve as big as you?,' Azarenka flirtatiously asked the young tennis ace. A cheeky, quick-witted Kyrgios immediately shot back: 'Private lessons of course'. In his post-match interview the 19-year-old stayed coy about his flirty Twitter exchange with Belarusian Victoria Azarenka . Former women's world number one Azarenka jumped in on a fan Q&A session with Kyrios on Twitter . Clearly enjoying their playful banter, Azarenka tweeted back an emoji-filled reply, hinting that the pair may carry on their conversation in private. 'Okay I'll book one,' Azarenka said. On Sunday Kyrios was asked if he would be giving any lessons to Azarenka on his day off. The 19-year-old raised his eyebrows and smirked before laughing awkwardly and replying: ‘I don’t know, let’s be honest. No comment, no comment.’ Last Australian standing at the tennis tournament and the first to reach the quarter-finals since a decade ago by Lleyton Hewitt, Kyrgios will face grand slam champion Andy Murray on Tuesday. Making his way into the history books, Kyrgios battled his own demons to progress into a last-eight showdown to become the youngest player in the men's quarter-finals since Andrei Cherkasov in 1990. The three spectators immediately seated themselves back down as they giggled and appeared humiliated . The Aussie young gun went on to stage a miracle comeback after a five-set triumph against Andreas Seppi . Contesting just his seventh grand slam event, the Canberra excitement machine is also the first teen to make the last eight of two majors since the great Federer. 'It feels so good,' Kyrgios said after the match. 'The crowd was unbelievable. 'I honestly didn't think I was going to come back and win that match. I was just going to hang in - this is incredible. 'This is my favourite court I've ever played on.' Nick Kyrgios of Australia reacts after winning the fourth set against Andreas Seppi  in Melbourne . Andreas Seppi of Italy plays a shot to Nick Kyrgios of Australia during their fourth round match on Saturday . Kyrgios' dad made an appearance after the match, saying how proud he was of his son. 'Unbelievable. Unbelievable. I just want to thank all the crowd - it's just unbelievable. They just got him over the line - kept him motivated,' Mr Kyrgios said. 'Thank you everybody - much appreciated and hope we could just go one more. When asked if he believed his son could pull through after being two-sets to love down, he responded: 'With the crowd pushing the way it was - his done it before - so his done it again. 'You got one more point to play I'd say. Just give it the best shot and it seems to be working for him so unbelievable.' Kyrgios watches his racquet bounce during his men's singles match against Italy's Andreas Seppi . His mobility restricted and explosive power diminished, Kyrgios obliterated a racquet at one point, such was his frustration at being unable to compete at full capacity early on. Kyrgios enjoyed several feisty exchanges with the crowd - twice reprimanding fans for interrupting him at crucial moments. Midway through the match he yelled out 'turn off your f***ing phone mate' after a loud ringtone echoed through Hisense Arena - and when someone yelled out during a crucial serve deep in the fifth set he caustically fired off: 'Are you right, mate?' after losing the point. Seppi won the opening set after breaking Kyrgios to love in the 11th game. Kyrgios grew more and more frustrated as he squandered multiple break points in the fourth game of the second set, almost apologetically telling spectators: 'I'm trying man. I can't walk, though.' After fending off a break point in the fifth game, Kyrgios couldn't hold the Italian out again and found himself in a deep, deep hole after dropping serve for a second time in the ninth game - and then the second set. But Kyrgios began to mount his stirring fightback as his back appeared to free up in the third set, which the Australian claimed after breaking Seppi for the first time.

Games in the fourth set went to serve before Seppi earned his match point in a tension-filled tiebreaker. Showing ice-cool nerves, Kyrgios thundered down a 201km/h ace to keep his Open hopes alive. Kyrgios then unleashed a withering backhand winner down the line on his first set point to force the decider. Australia's last hope followed up with a vicious down-the-line forehand winner to break Seppi again to seemingly have the veteran on the ropes. But he inexplicably dropped serve to love in an alarming run of 12 straight points to Seppi, who drew level at 4-4 and then had a break point to give himself the opportunity to serve out the match.

Kyrgios completed his second win from two sets down - after famously staving off nine match points against Richard Gasquet at Wimbledon last year - after three hours and 34 minutes when Seppi wilted and dropped serve to love in the 14th game of the epic final set. Despite Seppi being ranked only five places above him, Kyrgios's victory ranks as one of the finest of his burgeoning career.

Kyrgios's aching back then forced his withdrawal from this month's Hopman Cup before he lost a tight season opener in Sydney to Jerzy Janowicz.

"CLICK HERE to read Martin Samuel's match report of Arsenal's impressive victory at the Etihad Stadium. At some point in the near future we will have to ask whether honesty is the preserve of the English game or whether we are done with beating the integrity drum. The 24th minute at the Etihad, when Nacho Monreal brushed against Vincent Kompany to prompt a slow-motion collapse inside the penalty area, seems a good place to start. Arsenal’s left back looked like a sky diver, using the friction of Kompany’s body to launch himself into the night air and executing a safe landing with some cushioned rolls. It was tempting to applaud the audacity. Nacho Monreal (right) seemed to go down easily under Vincent Kompany's challenge to win the penalty . Manchester City captain Kompany stood his ground and Monreal appeared to fall easily over his leg . Monreal goes up into the air as Kompany tries to pull his body backwards and goes down in the box . So did Monreal dive? The answer is that we will never really know for sure, but even Arsene Wenger admitted that this one went their way. If the defender did, can you blame him? Based on everything else that goes on each week at every other stadium, then probably not. Mike Dean, bless him, bought it because at speed and without the benefit of an assistant referee or a fourth official with enough gumption to give him some guidance, he will be at ease with himself. ‘I’ve always said that referees need help and guidance in these situations because they have to make an instant decision,’ admitted Arsenal’s manager. Wenger was pretty gracious about it, accepting that the decision to award a penalty, converted by Santi Cazorla, turned in Arsenal’s favour on this occasion. Manuel Pellegrini knew it too. ‘The movement of Kompany allows him to dive,’ claimed Manchester City’s manager. ‘I am not saying it was a bad mistake of the referee, but the penalty changed the game and was not the reason we lost.’ He is spot on, there. Arsenal played at a different tempo to City and deserved to win here. For those who worry about the games that go on out there between players in the heat of battle, then the incident between Monreal and City’s captain is perfect fodder. The stakes were unusually high, amplified by the fact that Arsenal’s immediate rivals for a place in the Champions League - Manchester United, Tottenham and Southampton - all won on Saturday. The Arsenal defender appears to fall over quite dramatically as Kompany throws his hands into the air . Santi Cazorla (left) puts a right footed penalty past the diving Joe Hart to give Arsenal the lead from the spot . Arsene Wenger’s team were under pressure, particularly as anyone outside N7 expected this lot to be swatted aside at the home of the champions. There were demands on Manchester City too and there was an anticipation that they would match Chelsea’s performance at the Liberty Stadium, where they beat Swansea City 5-0, with a convincing win. Take nothing away from Arsenal’s work-rate and application because Wenger’s team, with the excellent Olivier Giroud spearheading their attack, did a number on City. They did a proper job on them. Giroud deserved his goal, flinging himself at Cazorla’s free-kick in the 67th minute free-kick to increase Arsenal’s advantage. This is a very good win. Beyond that is the bigger picture, the bone of contention that leaves a TV audience all over the world wondering whether Dean has been had over by some clever improvisation. The incident was not the classic trip, the outstretched leg or the clattering challenge that forces a referee to make a decision based on the aggression or the severity of the injury. Cazorla (centre) celebrates with Arsenal team-mates Olivier Giroud (left) and Alexis Sanchez . These are the issues Dennis Bergkamp address in his brilliant autobiography Stillness and Speed, where he admits that he would exaggerate the impact to draw attention to a foul. The Arsenal No 10 was forced to change his ways, under pressure from a dressing room that included the likes of Tony Adams, Steve Bould, Ian Wright and Lee Dixon. They just did things a certain way back then. Monreal’s fall was much cuter, a subtle form of the game that has crept in to English football over the past few seasons. They are all at it these days and it was only last week that Chelsea’s assistant manager Steve Holland hinted that Eden Hazard had been forced to master the craft of winning free-kicks in opposition territory. What a sad indictment of the modern game, a tacit acceptance that the players are calling the tune these days. Putting that to one side, Arsenal’s win was as clean as they come.

"Arsene Wenger admitted it was a big moment for Arsenal to finally win away from home against a big club as they beat champions Manchester City 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday. A first-half penalty from Santi Cazorla set the Gunners on their way, before Olivier Giroud's header after the break ensured Wenger's side would return to north London with maximum points.

'I did feel as though we could have done even better on the counter attack and killed off the game earlier than we did. 'But it was a big moment for us winning away at one of the big teams. 'We also looked in control throughout and that is especially pleasing considering we are away from home.' When asked if he felt the change in formation was paramount to the result Wenger shrugged off those suggestions, insisting the reason the team won was because everyone played to their full capabilities.

He added: 'I think it's more down to everyone doing well in their respective roles (than a change of formation). 'In many away games we have found ourselves one or two nil down before we have started to get into the match, and in 80% of those cases the team that takes the lead in a game then sets the precedent for the rest of the match. 'Today it was down to discipline. We fought well together as a team although some of the players were  physically short because they have just come back from injury.' When asked if the result at the Etihad would now put him off delving into the transfer window for a defensive midfielder, Wenger simply replied: 'Sometimes the fact that you find solutions internally is a blessing so at the moment all is well.'

'In the past we've come here and been too open as well, but today we defended well as a team and didn't give them any room or pockets of space to exploit, which Silva (David) can do to devastating effect. 'It was important for us to get the win with everyone else winning in the top half too, so hopefully we can build on this and have a good second half of the season. ‘We’re still in the Champions League, FA Cup and have plenty of games left in the Premier League to go too, so there's plenty to be positive about.'","Arsenal beat Manchester City 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday .

"Young tennis star Nick Kyrgios enjoyed several feisty exchanges with the crowd during an intense round four clash with Italy's Andreas Seppi at the Australian Open. But now the scrappy 19-year-old is facing accusations that he should have been disqualified after he swore at members of the crowd during Sunday's match. As fans packed the Hisense Arena on day seven at the Australian Open, the Canberra teenager delivered an early Australia Day celebration with a victory at Melbourne Park.

Where are you going?' as the crowd laughed . Nick Kyrgios served his way out of trouble to advance to the last eight with a 5-7 4-6 6-3 7-6(5) 8-6 win . Christopher Clarey from the New York Times wrote that the 19-year-old was lucky his temper and language didn't earn him a disqualification. 'If chair umpire Fergus Murphy had better hearing or had applied the letter of the tennis law, Kyrgios could have been disqualified for three code-of-conduct violations on the first Sunday: just as John McEnroe was 25 years ago in the same round of the 1990 Australian Open,' Mr Clarey wrote. 'Instead, Kyrgios got just one warning after spiking his racket when he lost the first set. But there was plenty more negative energy as well as energy, period, on display.' Kyrgios served his way out of trouble to notch a magical 5-7 4-6 6-3 7-6(5) 8-6 win to overcome the Italian, who had upset Swiss superstar Roger Federer in the third round.

"After one couple decided to pose for a very unique wedding photo - being chased by a terrifying T-Rex - it could only be a matter of time before other lovebirds followed in their footsteps. And now one couple have raised the bar, by mocking up a photo of them and their wedding party fleeing a group of Star Wars monsters. The huge Star Wars fans decided to pay homage to one of their favourite films by pretending to flee from deadly Star Wars Imperial AT-AT Walkers. And it would appear the couple threw . themselves into the idea, with the bride looking genuinely petrified as . the huge machines dwarf her and her wedding party. And now for the sequel! The pair couldn't resist their bridal party getting chased by a squad of Imperial AT-AT Walker . The menacing AT-AT Walkers can be seen stomping through a city in pursuit of the terrified party - and the bride and groom really committed to the picture . The groom is in danger of being outrun by a posse of bridesmaids clad in pink - but even in times of panic they have all managed to hang on to their bouquets. The image was taken by Toronto-based Little Blue Lemon photography after an image of a bridal party being followed by the huge Tyrannosaurus went viral, io9  reported. They said the couple were inspired by the wedding picture of a couple and their 16 friends and relatives being chased by a rampaging dinosaur. The couple said: 'Here’s our take on the idea… mostly because Leslie (and us) are huge Star Wars nerds! 'We couldn’t resist their bridal party getting chased by a squad of Imperial AT-AT Walkers! lol. So for all you Star Wars fans, this ones (Sic) for you.' Unexpected guest: Getting married can be a darting prospect, but this bride has a good reasons to look terrified.. she is being chased by a menacing T-Rex.

The amusing photo of the T-Rex group was the creation of  Quinn Miller, 22, who digitally added the giant dinosaur chasing the entire wedding party out of the ceremony. Mr Miller took the shot at the wedding of Katie Young, 23, and James Lowder, 21, from Louisiana at The Myrtles Plantation on Sunday. He told io9.com that . he had known the groom for a while and knew he was a fan of dinosaurs . so he pitched the idea to him a few days before the wedding and he . 'loved the concept.' Incredibly the dramatic photo - featuring 16 guests and the happy couple - was taken in just one shot at the weekend. 'They are such a fun couple and a fun wedding party that all I had to do is tell them to run away from an invisible dinosaur. And they did. We did it in one take - the entire shooting process in two minutes tops,' he told Stuff.co.nz. 'I've seen it done twice,' Miller told GoodMorningAmerica.com. 'I saw one that was kind of viral when it . happened, but it just wasn't that great. Then I saw another one that was . just a generic dinosaur picture with the people put into a prehistoric . scene. But I'm really nit-picky about Photoshop.'

"The Cyprus Referees' Association on Monday said its members will boycott all domestic cup and league matches for one week in retaliation to a midnight bomb attack at the home of a referee's mother. Association chief Michalis Argyrou said the executive board will meet again in a week to decide whether to extend the boycott after sitting down with police officials to gauge progress in the investigation. He said the association expects police 'not to leave things to simple pronouncements'' but to proceed with an in-depth probe that will get to the bottom of the case and help protect match officials. Cypriot referees will stage a week-long boycott in protest to four bomb attacks so far this season . Argyrou said referees are fed up following the fourth bomb attack against one of their own this season. The Cyprus Football Association condemned the attack against referee Thomas Mouskos' mother's home as 'exceedingly cowardly' and an 'act of terrorism.' Police said the makeshift, high-yield explosive device went off outside the front door of the 60-year-old woman's Limassol home shortly after midnight. Senior police officer Ioannis Soteriades said the woman was unharmed because she was in an upstairs bedroom at the time of the blast. Soteriades said that Mouskos was under police protection after receiving threats against him. Referees in Cyprus are often the target of insults and threats over perceived poor officiating or bias. But the latest incident comes at a particularly sensitive time for Cypriot football after top ref Marios Panayi publicly came forward with match-rigging allegations that prompted Cyprus FA chief Costakis Koutsokoumnis to admit that the first division was plagued by the problem.","Home of a referee's mother was subject to a midnight bomb attack .

"A high-stress job which left her 'burning the candle at both ends', combined with her mum falling very ill were the triggers that forced Irena Macri to take a step back and reexamine her life. She quit her high-paying job in the corporate world and through her mum's battle with cancer began to reevaluate her own health and wellbeing. 'Mum was sick in 2009. She had colon cancer and then got diagnosed with thyroid cancer soon after,' Irena told Daily Mail Australia, adding that the diagnosis was a shock as her mother had always been very healthy. Scroll down for video . Irena Macri is the blogger behind popular food website Eat Drink Paleo, which has  170,000 monthly readers . Irena, here with her mum Tamara in 2007, started researching the 'lifestyle' after she quit her high-stress job and her mother fell ill . She works out of a 'small kitchen' in London, creating and photographing all her own food . 'She is now in remission but had to undergo surgeries for both,' she continued. 'For us as a family it was scary of course but we all stayed as positive as we could and mum was determined to not let the illness affect her love of life.' Through her own research Irena experimented with various trends and diets before discovering the Paleo lifestyle in 2011. 'Paleo is a diet and I guess it’s a lifestyle, it is inspired by our hunter gatherer ancestors. 'We just take cues from the way our ancestors lived and look at what we as humans have thrived on,' Irena explained. Irena's mum suffered from colon and thyroid cancer despite being healthy, and now grows her own vegetables . The paleo diet excludes refined sugars and grains, plus dairy, legumes, and anything processed . Irena insists the approach is just as much lifestyle-based as it is about changing what you eat . Now just a few years on she runs her wildly successful blog Eat Drink Paleo which has over 170,000 readers a month, and has just released a cookbook of the same name. 'It excludes refined sugar and grains, anything that comes in a package and has ingredients you can’t pronounce,' Irena said. Dairy, legumes and any processed foods are also banned on the Paleo diet. But she insisted the approach is more lifestyle based than simply changing one's diet, and the focus lies in many aspects of a person's health. 'There’s the lifestyle aspect of paleo which doesn't get talking about as much, people that follow the paleo/primal lifestyle are really focused on improving sleep, reducing stress and stress management,' Irena said . Dairy, legumes and any processed foods are also banned on the Paleo diet . Irena quit her high-paying job in the corporate world to fulfill her life-long dream of working with food . Irena's friend, letterer and designer Carla Hackett who worked on the cookbook . '(It's about) getting outdoors and getting in touch with our more primal activities,' she added. 'It’s probably more important than the food to be honest, if people didn't even follow the diet but made improvements in the lifestyle aspects it would have a huge impact.' Irena's mother is now in her late sixties but 'keeps a very active lifestyle' and 'has a big garden where she grows vegetables and fruit and tries to eat nourishing food.' The author explained that her relationship with food can be traced back to her family life in Ukraine, where she grew up and lived until she was 16. 'I have very fond memories of my childhood and everyone in the family was a big fan of cooking,' Irena recalled. She said she remembers harvesting her own food and berries, and everything was made fresh as there were no fast food options. 'I have very fond memories of my childhood and everyone in the family was a big fan of cooking,' Irena recalled . Designer Carla Hackett helped create the front cover of the book . Eat Drink Paleo published by Penguin Books is now available at Booktopia and Bookworld . 'The cooking was kind of the centre of socialising with my family,' Irena said. 'When I look back I would consider what we ate as very nutrient dense I just didn't know it at the time. 'My parents were quite active, my dad was an athlete and my mum was a swimmer, both competitively. 'We spent a lot of time outside, I think I had a really good foundation,' she added. With her Paleo lifestyle Irena encourages people to take an 80/20 approach to 'sustain the lifestyle and a little treat every now and then'. 'When it comes to eating well my approach is that 80 percent of the time I eat a very clean Paleo diet,' she explained. With her Paleo lifestyle Irena encourages people to take an 80/20 approach to 'sustain the lifestyle and a little treat every now and then' She said moderation and variety is the key, so people don't get too 'obsessed with things' 'The 20 percent is for the things I add into my diet like a little bit of white rice or dairy', Irena said before adding that the additions could be different for every person. 'Moderation and variety is the key, we just tend to get a little bit obsessed with things.' From a health perspective Irena believes the Paleo lifestyle has reduced her stress levels, increased her energy levels, improved her immune systems and helped her deal with a whole host of chronic illnesses as simple as cold and flus. And with a global following of 87,000 people it seems that others are experiencing the same positive results. What started as a resource for others to find Paelo recipes and support - something Irena struggled to discover when she initially started the blog - is now a full-time lifestyle for her. Zucchini and Bacon Fritters are just one of many recipes that appear in Irena's cookbook . Ingredients - Onion Relish . 3 tbsp virgin olive oil . 2 medium brown onions, sliced . 1 long red chilli, fi nely diced . 2/3 tsp sea salt . 1 garlic clove, fi nely diced . 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar . 1 tbsp tomato paste . 1/2 tsp coriander seed powder . 1/2 cup water . Ingredients - Fritters . 2 rashers of bacon, diced and . trimmed from excess fat . Ghee for cooking . 2 medium green zucchinis, grated . (discard the middle with seeds) 1 medium carrot, peeled and grated . 1/2 chopped green onion . 2 eggs . 2 tbsp tapioca fl our . 2/3 tsp sea salt . 1/2 tsp pepper . 1/4 tsp gluten–free baking powder . 3 tbsp coconut oil . Method . 'It has completely changed my life, I still pinch myself everyday,' Irena revealed. 'I work everyday, it’s a passion but its also a job.' She cooks in her London home, and creates and photographs all her own food. 'I have a very small kitchen for someone who writes about food,' Irena joked. Although she has a few gadgets she can't live without such as a food processor and blender, 'I have one frying pan, it’s all very basic'. Eat Drink Paleo was originally self-published as an e-book but with a little help from crowd-funding meant she could produce a higher quality end product. It has since been published in its latest form by Penguin Books Australia and is available from Booktopia or Bookworld RRP $34.99.","Irena Macri is the brains behind popular food blog Eat Drink Paleo .

"Sydney siege survivor Harriette Denny has revealed her final thoughts from inside the Lindt Cafe, where she was forced to beg for survival at the hands of crazed gunman Man Haron Monis. The 30-year-old cafe worker was among 18 hostages who were trapped inside the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place in December. She managed to escape before Monis began shooting. In a snippet from an upcoming 60 Minutes interview, the 30-year-old Sunshine Coast woman said her last moments in front of the gunman were filled with appreciation for being able to experience the joy of being pregnant. Scroll down for video . Pregnant Sydney siege survivor Harriette Denny has revealed her final thoughts from inside the Lindt Cafe, where she was forced to beg for survival at the hands of crazed gunman Man Haron Monis . 'I was very grateful that I was able to experience the pure love and happiness of being pregnant,' she told reporter Liz Hayes. Ms Denny also discussed her fear of being shot by Monis, who went on to cause the death of Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson. 'At that time I remember thinking, if he shoots me, as long as I don’t feel it or see it coming I’d be okay with it,' she said. The 30-year-old cafe worker was among 18 hostages who were trapped inside the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place in December. She managed to escape before Monis began shooting . Harriette Denny was one of 18 hostages taken held up at the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place. She will tell her story in a 60 Minutes interview . In a snippet from an upcoming 60 Minutes interview, the 30-year-old Sunshine Coast woman said her last moments in front of the gunman were filled with appreciation for being able to experience the joy of being pregnant . In a preview teaser of the upcoming interview, Ms Denny revealed each hostage was forced to beg Monis for their lives, which was when she realised one of the group was going to die. 'We had to beg for our lives. He was going to shoot someone,' she said. In another clip, when asked 'at what point did you think you could die?', fellow hostage Fiona Ma replied: 'When he fired the first shot.' Harriette Denny was among the last group of hostages to successfully escape the clutches of Man Monis from inside the Lindt cafe. She will be featured on the 60 Minutes special . Harriette Denny pictured in the days after the Sydney siege inside the Lindt Cafe. Here she visits the floral shrine which enveloped Martin Place that week . 60 Minutes has yet to announce when the program will go to air but the promotional videos are tagged 'Coming Soon'. There was industry conjecture that the Nine Network could roll the ratings dice and put the top rating 60 Minutes against Channel Seven's coverage of the men's tennis final at the Australian Open next Sunday. Channel Nine told Daily Mail Australia that: 'The siege story will include interviews with two staff members of the Lindt Café who were held hostage during the siege: Fiona Ma and Harriette Denny.' 'At least another six survivors will be interviewed for the story,' the network revealed to DMA. During the siege, Harriette's frantic friends flocked to her Facebook page to relay their well wishes . In extended interviews with 60 Minutes reporter Liz Hayes, the hostages are asked 'at what point did you think you could die?'. 'When he fired the first shot,' Fiona Ma answered . The Nine Network confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that 'Liz Hayes will be reporting. Many of the survivors specifically requested that she be the one to interview them and tell their story' 'Liz Hayes will be reporting. Many of the survivors specifically requested that she be the one to interview them and tell their story.' Among those believed to have also been signed by Nine are Joel Herat and Jarrod Morton Hoffman, the sum total of all the interviews thought to be nudging $1 million. It's also understood that Julie Taylor, 35, the barrister at Eight Selborne Chambers who is now 23 weeks pregnant, will be featured in the 60 Minutes special. She was the hostage protected by her close friend Katrina Dawson, who died after she was hit by a bullet at the conclusion of the siege, and the one according to media analysts who has the most interesting story to tell. There was industry conjecture on Tuesday that the Nine Network could roll the ratings dice and put the top rating 60 Minutes against Channel Seven's coverage of the men's tennis final at the Australian Open next Sunday . It's rumoured Nine could be paying up to $1 million for exclusive access to the stories of at least eight hostages who were kept captive for almost 17 hours in December at Martin Place . Sydney siege victim Marcia Mikhael is believed to have secured a deal of at least $350,000 to tell her story to the Seven Network, as the commercial rivals opened up their cheque books to secure survivors for their respective upcoming specials. It's understood Channel Nine put in an offer of up to $300,000 for Marcia Mikhael to tell her horror story from inside the Lindt cafe on December 15th. However, Ms Mikhael, 43, who suffered shrapnel wounds to her legs, opted to go with Seven after they submitted an even bigger offer, Daily Mail Australia understand . The networks have been so desperate to snare the best stories for their head-to-head broadcasts, they have been sending out their stars to 'door knock' the 16 survivors to convince them to tell-all. Marcia Mikhael is carried from the Lindt cafe after suffering shrapnel wounds to her legs. She has been the subject of bids to tell-all by rival television networks and has vowed to use money from her interviews to set up a foundation for the victims of the Sydney siege and fellow hostages . Lindt Chocolate Cafe worker Elly Chen managed to escape with another female colleague late on Monday afternoon of the Sydney siege. It's not known if the 22-year-old has been signed up by a TV network . Harriette Denny was among the last of five hostages to run out of the Lindt cafe as the siege reached its climax shortly after 2am. Television networks and magazines are vying for their stories have been willing to pay thousands . One of the first to escape, John O'Brien, 83, who was seen running from the Lindt Cafe in Sydney's Martin Place with barrister Stefan Balafoutis, will also speak on the Seven program. He's rumoured to have signed on for $100,000. Meanwhile, Channel Nine's 60 Minutes special is believed to feature up to 10 survivors who escaped after being held by crazed gunman Man Haron Monis for almost 17 hours. Daily Mail Australia understands the rival specials were set to air on Sunday February 1, which is the week when the television ratings season kicks off, rather than Australia Day as has previously been claimed. This would be after the coronial inquest starts on January 29. However, confusing the matter for Seven, is the screening of the Men's Final at the Australian Tennis Open on that Sunday. Some media experts suggest that the Seven special could be screened immediately before the big match to counter any move by Nine. The injured are rushed out of the Lindt cafe after the siege conclusion .

"During January and February, a geomagnetic storm hit parts of the UK and treated residents to a rare and extremely beautiful Aurora Borealis light display. A photographer from Scotland took to the hills and lakes of Caithness to capture more than 2,000 pictures of this event - usually only seen in more northern regions - and created a stunning time-lapse video being hailed as evidence of the best Northern Lights display the UK has seen for over 12 years. Polish photographer Maciej Winiarcyzk spent days putting together the video, which he says was the highest point in this solar maximum cycle. This time-lapse video of the Northern Lights as they travelled over Scotland in February, video grab pictured, was created using more than 2,000 pictures. It is being hailed as evidence of the best Northern Lights display the UK has seen for more than 12 years . There are two types of Aurora - Aurora Borealis, which means ‘dawn of the north’, and Aurora Australis’, known as ‘dawn of the south.’ They . are caused when electrically charged particles from the sun enter . the Earth’s atmosphere. These so-called geomagnetic storms occur when a . solar wind or cloud of magnetic field hits the Earth’s magnetic field. Usually . the charged particles from the sun are deflected by the Earth’s . magnetic field, but some do manage to enter the atmosphere and collide . with gas particles. These collisions emit light. As a result, Aurora is most common around the magnetic poles and is most often seen in areas with little light pollution. Over the course of January and . February, this geomagnetic storm and shock wave from the solar wind was . so strong and significant, it travelled further south over the UK and . could be seen in areas with little cloud cover. Auroral . displays appear in many colours although pale green and pink are the . most common. Shades of red, yellow, green, blue, and violet have also been . reported. The . common, greenish-yellow colour is caused by colliding oxygen molecules . approximately 60 miles (96km) above Earth. Rare, red auroras are produced . by oxygen molecules situated much higher up, at around 200 miles (321km). Nitrogen produces blue or purplish-red aurora. A cycle is 11 years of the of the sun's . activity, which creates the dancing colours that were observed by lucky Britons as far south as Essex a fortnight ago. Winiarcyzk said: 'It was for sure the best light show in this solar cycle, even this millennium. I've never seen anything quite as spectacular. 'Due to the fact there is less light pollution in Scotland, the breathtaking sight could be witnessed in all its glory.' Winiarcyzk focused on landmarks, cliffs and castles in Caithness while tracking the wild night sky overhead. The 41-year-old astronomy enthusiast only took up photography two years ago, after years of putting his passion to one side. Since then he has quickly become one of the country's highest regarded time-lapse photographers. While these shots were taken in the Sinclair's Bay area of Caithness, Winiarcyzk has also photographed other locations in Scotland, including 4,000 year-old tombs near Camster, Loch More and Newton Forest. Winiarcyzk said: . 'I came to Caithness because of a job. I had no idea the area would be a . place where I could witness such events. It is the perfect place and . has allowed me to revive my hobby. 'The . main theme of the video is to show the beauty of the night sky and . remind people what they are missing by staying at home and watching TV. 'I . wanted to squeeze in as many aurora shots as possible as these are . often colourful displays, which appeal to people and grab their . attention.' Ken Kennedy, director of the Aurora . section of the British Astronomical Association (BAA), added: 'Maciej's . video is of such great quality it can be scientifically analysed and . will be used as evidence to show the peak of this solar maximum cycle. 'There is normally one peak to a . solar cycle, where we see the strongest aurora. We believed it to be in . 2008 however the display witnessed a fortnight ago was stronger leading . us to believe this cycle had two peaks and is now in decline. 'In . the video you can see rare sub storms, which is a sudden connection of . the sun and the earth's magnetic fields which allow the charged . particles to flow to the polar regions.'

"Two Florida parents were arrested on Tuesday after police found them living in a criminally filthy home with their two young children, 15 pit bulls, and hundreds of feeding insects. The children of Dutsin Deck, 28, and Katie Renner, 27, aged one and a half years and five years were placed with a relative as the Florida Department of Children and Families investigates their case. The home on the 5600 block of Viburnum Court in Polk City showed signs of dangerous neglect as it was covered in animal feces from 15 different pit bulls and was infested with creepy crawlers. Dustin Deck (left), 28, and Katie Renner (right), 27, were arrested after police discovered their Florida home ridden with fifth, animal feces, and poorly cared for children and animals . Fifth and animal feces piled on the floor of the revolting Florida home along with children's toys . Drug paraphernalia was discovered in the Florida home ridden with filth . 15 pit bulls, eight of whom were puppies were taken away by Animal Control after being discovered in an unhealthy habitat . Police went to visit the home after Renner accused Deck of domestic violence earlier that day at the gas station, reports the Orlando Sentinel. When authorities arrived at the grotesque house they saw seven adult pit bulls and eight pit bull puppies both inside and outside the home. Dog feces festered next to children's toys and carpets in the home were soaked in urine. Flies and cockroaches gathered around the baby's highchair to eat stale food and congregated to feast on the crumbs which were scattered over piles of dirty dishes. Police also found marijuana and a bong sitting on a table in the living room both of which were within reach of young children. Renner told police that she believed the condition of her home was acceptable for children and that they were 'happy.' 'She told deputies if people don't like her house then they don't need to come over,' the Polk County Sheriff's Office said in a report yesterday. Flies and cockroaches feasted on stale food on the baby's highchair . Pictured here are dirty dishes with rotting food, flies, and cockroaches in the revolting home . Drug paraphernalia scattered throughout the home was one of the factors leading to Dustin Deck's and Katie Renner's arrest . Dog feces was scattered all over the disgusting Florida home . 'She admitted to the marijuana being in the home and admitted to smoking marijuana, saying she believed marijuana should be legal,' continued the report. Animal Control officers were also brought in to remove the 15 dogs since they were exposed to intense heat and didn't have access to water. 'Two pit-bull dogs were locked in a cage with no overhead cover to protect them from the direct sunlight and intense heat,'  the report said. 'There was no access to fresh or clean water.' Both Deck and Renner face a laundry list of charges. Deck was charged with child neglect, possession of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia animal cruelty, battery on a law enforcement officer and tampering with evidence. Renner faces charges for child neglect, possession of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia, animal cruelty,battery on a law enforcement officer and tampering with evidence. 'These two are in jail where they belong,' said Sheriff Grady Judd in a statement. 'It is one thing if you want to sit around, smoke pot, and live in nasty conditions as an adult. But it is an entirely different thing if you do those things while neglecting the basic needs of children and animals under your care,' he concluded. The residence also housed 15 pit bulls eight of whom were puppies in extreme heat and with limited access to food and water . Not only were children's toys scattered among dirty laundry and dog feces, marijuana was also allegedly found within reach of the children living in the home . An insect infestation plagued almost every corner of the filthy Florida home . The home in the 5600 block of Viburnum Court in Polk City is soiled with animal waste from 15 pit bulls and infested with insects .

"Thousands of favourite British garden plants and flowers could be banned from sale at garden centres under new EU proposals. The popular lavender Lavandula Hidcote, the highly scented iris Jane Phillips, the holly shrub known as Ilex Golden King and the pink star-shaped clematis Nelly Moser are among those at risk. A European Commission shake-up of plant legislation proposes that in future each plant variety must be given a detailed scientific description – as well as being listed on an official plant register. Lavender Hidcote lines the path of this home in Sussex . But the UK does not have an official register of plants and experts say it would be too expensive and take years to set up. As a result, unregistered plants could be removed from sale in garden centres and other shops. The aim of the new legislation is to ensure consumers are not sold fake or inferior plants. But growers and  gardening experts are incensed that what was intended as a simplification of trade rules could end up with a new EU law that dictates what plants people are allowed to buy. Anyone selling an unregistered plant could face hefty fines. The draft legislation is demanding such detailed information about each plant variety that experts believe descriptions would be two pages long and would even have to specify the lengths of hairs on stems. At present in the UK, the nearest thing to an official register is a list of 52,000 varieties held by the Royal Horticultural Society, the country’s leading gardening charity. It is regarded as a plant ‘bible’ but only about 2,000 listed plants have an official botanical description. Industry insiders say growers  and plant breeders would also be deterred by the expected high costs of registering a plant. Some breeders who wish to sell new varieties overseas already pay £400 to £500 to private consultants who write botanical descriptions. Charges are higher for food seeds and plants and can cost up to £1,000. Golden King holly is one of the plants more likely to be banned in British garden centres . The Horticultural Trades Association is urging Environment Secretary Owen Paterson to stop the Brussels meddling. Gary Scroby, HTA policy manager, said: ‘The EC say it’s not their intention to impose bureaucracy and cost on the industry, but the details leave it open to deliver exactly that outcome.’ Graham Spencer, who runs Plants For Europe, an agent for plant breeders, said: ‘Everyone is really worried about this. We could lose lots of varieties. Take Lavender  Hidcote. It is one of the most  widely grown lavenders but it does not have an official recognisable description. Growers might decide not to grow if they could not label  it as Lavender Hidcote. ‘British horticulture is all about developing unusual plants. We have a heritage of growing novel varieties. The whole trade is driven by varieties and people like to go and buy their favourites. We are all for consumer protection but this will harm consumers and reduce consumer choice.’ Bob Brown, who runs Just Must . Perennials and has introduced hundreds of new UK varieties, said: ‘I . have a business based on novelty. We can’t pay to register 100 plants a . year, it will kill the business.’ One of the most popular daffodils in the country, a variety known as Narcissus King Alfred, could also be affected. Clematis 'Nelly Moser' and Iris Jane Philips are among the unusual plants which the Horticultural Trades Association feel should be grown more . Also at risk are the spiky scarlet flowered montbretia (Crocosmia Lucifer), a tree mallow (Lavatera Barnsley), the lavender petalled cranesbill (Geranium  Johnson’s Blue), aromatic catmint (Nepeta Six Hills Giant) and the highly fragrant mock orange (Philadelphus Belle Etoile). Jenna Fox-Wheddon, supervisor of the garden shop at Sissinghurst Castle in Kent, said they both sell and grow Lavandula Hidcote and Geranium Johnson’s Blue in their gardens, first developed by poet and author Vita Sackville-West in the 1930s. Both the 12th Century Cranborne Estate in Dorset and the Ness Botanic Gardens on the Wirral Peninsula grow the perfumed iris Jane Phillips. Vicky Ford, Tory MEP for the East of England, said: ‘This is very poorly drafted legislation. England is famous for the diversity of our gardens. We either need to amend this completely or kick the entire proposal into the long grass – forever.’ A Defra spokeswoman said:  ‘We are working with other EU countries to retain simpler rules which will allow companies to  continue to sell ornamental plants and seeds without specific botanical descriptions.’ An EC health and consumer policy spokesman said: ‘There is nothing in the proposals that suggest we wish to ban anything. Our aim is to make plant sales more transparent.’","Popular British plants are at risk of being banned from sale at garden centres under new proposals .

"Paris St-Germain and Brazil defender Thiago Silva has lamented his side's lack of concentration and consistency this season. Les Parisiens are third in Ligue 1, four points behind leaders Lyon, following a 4-2 win over Evian on Sunday at the Parc des Princes. Silva told reporters: 'The side struggles to play well for the full 90 minutes . Thiago Silva  (right) battles for possession with Evian's Nicolas Benezet during PSG's 4-2 win . Silva breaks free of Modou Sougou as the defender surges forward . 'Against Bastia we didn't play well after the half-time break. This time, it was before half-time. It's clearly a problem of concentration. We aren't playing as well as last season.' He added: 'We are all discussing the problem to find a solution.' PSG had been tipped to retain the Ligue 1 title comfortably this season after last year's runners-up AS Monaco sold off key players such as James Rodriguez to work within new financial constraints. Instead, they find themselves trailing Lyon and Marseille, despite having finished 28 and 29 points respectively ahead of them last term.

"Arsene Wenger says Mesut Ozil is ready to rumble after returning to full fitness with a new muscular physique. As Sportsmail revealed earlier this month, Ozil has built up his upper body and core strength during his gruelling rehabilitation programme after a knee injury to prepare for the rigours of Barclays Premier League football. The Germany midfielder is set to make his first start since October in Sunday's FA Cup clash against Brighton. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has confirmed suggestions that Mesut Ozil has improved his core strength . Arsenal playmaker Ozil worked on his core strength during his lengthy spell on the sidelines . Wenger joked Ozil will be happier when he looks in the mirror after working on his upper body strength . While Ozil’s quality has not been questioned since his arrival from Real Madrid 18 months ago, his slender frame led to suggestions that he can be bullied by top-flight defenders. But his new muscular frame should help him stand up to the physical nature of English football. ‘He is bigger in the upper body, he has worked hard,’ said Wenger. ‘Every day he is in the gym and he can work on it. You don’t have the fatigue of the games — and it’s better when you look in the mirror! ‘It is not only down to pure strength when you play. It is down to when to switch your strength on and the timing of your switch-on. ‘Players like Claude Makelele, for instance, were not monsters but when he went for a challenge he had the technique to use his strength in an efficient way. Chelsea defensive midfielder Claude Makelele knew exactly when to use strength . ‘It is a technique more than a power. A guy who spends a bit of time in the gym kills his co-ordination and becomes more rigid. ‘Winning a challenge is down to flexibility and co-ordination, switching on all the muscles at the right time. That is not down to lifting weights.’ How the Arsenal manager fits Ozil, the club’s record signing, into his starting XI is a problem he must solve in the coming weeks. With Santi Cazorla, Alexis Sanchez and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all vying for attacking midfield positions, it is not a foregone conclusion that Ozil will be an automatic choice. Wenger added: ‘He will come back very strong and we have the luxury to have some players who are completely fresh and rested. It can be very interesting if you manage to use them well.’","Arsene Wenger has confirmed Mesut Ozil beefed up during injury spell .

"John McCain's office is denying reports that Syrian rebels the senator was pictured with were responsible for the kidnap of Lebanese Shi'ites. According to the Lebanese press, two of the men pictured with Mr McCain had taken eleven people from Lebanon hostage. Nine of the pilgrims are still being held a year after they were taken hostage as they returned to Beirut from a pilgrimage in Iran. Rebel meeting: Senator John McCain has been accused of posing with members of Northern Storm . As negotiations continue for the release of the remaining hostages, the Daily Star in Beirut claims to have identified two of the men pictured with Mr McCain as being with the Northern Storm group believed to be behind the kidnapping. Mr McCain's spokesman Brian Rogers told Buzzfeed: 'A number of the Syrians who greeted . Senator McCain upon his arrival in Syria asked to take pictures with . him, and as always, the Senator complied.' He added it 'would be regrettable' if any of the men turned out to be the suspected kidnappers, Mohamed Nour and Abu Ibrahim. The senator's spokesman added that Mr McCain did not condone 'the kidnapping of Lebanese Shia pilgrims . or [have] any communication with those responsible'. Secret visit: John McCain made a brief stop in Syria to meet leaders of the rebel opposition on Monday . Anwar Ibrahim, one . of the men taken hostage by the Northern Storm group, claims he recognized . Mohammad Nour, chief spokesman and photographer for the kidnappers, . standing next to Mr McCain. 'I recognized him immediately. He was the photographer who was brought in to take our photos. He works with the kidnappers. He knows them very well,' Mr Ibrahim told the Daily Star. He also claims to have recognized another man associated with the hostage-takers. However, Mr Rogers said none of the people Mr McCain met on his brief trip to Syria on Monday shared the names of the kidnappers. 'As the Syrian Emergency Task Force has . said: ""Senator McCain did not go to Syria to meet with anyone named . Mohamad Nour or Abu Ibrahim. Two members of our organization were . present in the meeting, and no one called himself by either name"",' he added. The senator's spokesman suggested the story could be part of the Assad-regime's propaganda, adding: 'It’s not surprising that the . pro-Hezbollah forces supporting the Assad regime who originally promoted . this distortion would seek to smear anything and anyone supporting the . Syrian opposition.' Secret visit: Senator McCain poses with Syrians during his meeting with the rebel opposition fighting Assad . Mr McCain traveled to Syria to meet leaders of the rebel opposition, who have asked the U.S for weapons and airstrikes against Hezbollah and Assad's forces.

"Jose Mourinho insists his side do care about the FA Cup after an astonishing 4-2 defeat to Bradford on Saturday extinguished any hope of the Blues winning an unprecedented quadruple.

"Cristiano Ronaldo will have the usual queue of rivals wanting to swap shirts with him after Saturday's game against Cordoba, even if it costs them 50 euros for the privilege. Cordoba's Romanian striker Florin Andone has revealed every time one of the players at the cash-strapped club gives away a shirt at the end of a game they have to pay 50 euros for it because they can't afford to keep giving players new jerseys. Andone fell foul of Cordoba's rule earlier in the season when he swapped with Luis Suarez. He says: 'I said to Suarez: 'Can I have your shirt?' He said to me: 'Of course you can but I want yours in return'. It made me proud to think he wanted my shirt. I knew I would have to pay 50 euros to replace it but on this occasion I didn't mind. Cristiano Ronaldo won't be short of Cordoba players lining up for his shirt but will they cough up the cash? Real Madrid are the richest club in the world and have an endless supply of shirts for the Ballon d'Or winner . Cordoba striker Florin Andone (left) and his colleagues have to fork out if they swap too many shirts . 'I would like to have a Madrid shirt after Saturday's game. Everyone will want to swap with Ronaldo and I would love to be the one he exchanges with him but if not then I don't mind who I swap with be it [Alvaro] Arbeloa or Nacho. Real Madrid and Barcelona players have a never ending supply of shirts throughout a season but players from smaller clubs in Spain are issued with a limited number and must reimburse the club if they go beyond the limit. If Andone fails to secure Ronaldo's jersey he will settle for one from Alvaro Arbeloa (left) or Nacho (right) There will be no problem tomorrow if Ronaldo is happy to give his shirt without getting one in exchange but if he wants a swap as Suarez did then Andone will have to cough up again. Suarez has form for making sure he gets a shirt back from anyone he gives one to. In his autobiography Crossing the Line he says: 'I asked a referee for his shirt once. He'd asked for mine, via one of the club officials, and I said: 'Okay... he can have one of mine if I can have one of his.' He never sent me it. That was a pity. I would like to have had a referee's shirt to wear on my day off.'","Cordoba take on La Liga leaders Real Madrid in clash on Saturday .

"The French Football League (LFP) is yet to decide whether or not former Newcastle playmaker Hatem Ben Arfa can sign for Nice. The 27-year-old is keen to join the Ligue 1 club as a free agent after his Newcastle contract was cancelled earlier this month, but could be prevented by FIFA rules which state a player cannot play for more than two clubs in the same season. Ben Arfa's appearance for Newcastle Under-21s on August 25, before moving on loan to Hull, was considered an official match by FIFA. Hatem Ben Arfa remains in limbo over his Nice debut with the French Football League stalling on a decision . The former Newcastle United midfielder was released from his contract at St James' Park earlier this month . Nice are seeking to push the deal through before Friday's meeting with Marseille and were hopeful the LFP would rule in their favour this week after receiving Ben Arfa's international transfer certificate from the English Football Association via the French Football Federation.

A statement published on Nice's official website read: 'There is no decision today regarding approval for Hatem Ben Arfa's contract. 'The France international, who remains in Nice training for the derby (against Marseille) with his team-mates, is in a state of limbo. 'The League would like the international federation (FIFA) to express an official position before it makes its decision. To that end, the LFP has asked the FFF to communicate with FIFA's Player Status Committee.' Ben Arfa played for Hull City during an ill-fated loan spell earlier this season as well as Newcastle Under-21s . The French play-maker struggled to hit form at Hull and had his loan deal ended prematurely by The Tigers . On Sunday Ben Arfa admitted his frustration over the stalled move on Nice's website. 'I do not understand why they would try to stop me from playing in France, my home, and say I should be in England or somewhere else,' he said. 'Why always try to create problems when there are none? 'I have only one desire - to play again on the pitches of Ligue 1, to have fun with my team-mates, and to give pleasure to the fans who have welcomed me as ever.'

It was initially thought the 28-year old Colombian was free to leave Craven Cottage following the west London club's relegation from the Premier League but Fulham want a fee to compensate paying his £70,000 a week wages in recent seasons. In black and white: River Plate have made a move for Fulham's Hugo Rodallega - Pachuca are also interested . Shanghai were keen to make Rodallega a marquee signing and despite the player being interested in leaving Fulham, he won't be going to China. He told TyC Sports: 'I will try to get in at River. I don't think it's going to be easy this business, but I really would like to play there. 'I really would like a change and River is a very important club.'

The 22-year-old New Zealand star has been a target for Wolves in recent weeks but Uwe Rosler has expressed an interest with a likely deal costing £1.75m.

Inter have been linked with a raft of strikers including Chelsea's Fernando Torres and Javier Hernandez of Manchester United. They have made offers but most entail initial loan proposals with fees to follow in a year's time. That is indicative of their offer to Cardiff City for Gary Medel. While they have asked to pay £9m next season, Galatasaray have offered £10m now for the Chile midfielder. It means clubs are holding out for better offers but Southampton do want a quick resolution to Osvaldo's future.

"Paul Gambaccini is to return to BBC radio after he was cleared of historic allegations of sex abuse. The veteran broadcaster, who spent almost a year on police bail, will be in the studio on Friday to record a new edition of his Radio 4 music quiz Counterpoint. The presenter, 65, will then return to his popular weekly Radio 2 show on Saturday November 14. Paul Gambaccini, who has spent almost a year on police bail, will return to the BBC radio studios on Friday . The BBC has so far made no comment about the presenter’s future and declined to comment last night. But one source who asked not to be named said: ‘Paul will be returning to both of the shows. ‘He will be in the studio on Friday to record Counterpoint and he will also record the subsequent heats. The taping on Friday is for broadcast at a later date but he will be back on Radio 2 next month.’ The DJ was arrested in October last year as part of Operation Yewtree, set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal to investigate historic sex abuse cases. Mr Gambaccini was accused of sexually assaulting two teenage boys in the 1980s. He has always protested his innocence but agreed to step down from presenting duties while police pursued their inquiries. Comedian Jimmy Tarbuck was also arrested and released without charge as part of the operation . After his arrest in 2013 he compared his treatment to the musical The Scottsboro Boys which he had just seen. ‘It concerned a group of black men in Alabama in the 1930s who were falsely accused of sexual offences,’ he said. ‘Within hours, I was arrested by Operation Yewtree. Nothing had changed, except this time there was no music.’ Mr Gambaccini’s ordeal ended earlier this month when the Crown Prosecution Service said there was insufficient evidence to bring charges against him and an unidentified 75-year-old man who was arrested on the same day. The police’s treatment of the broadcaster and in particular the amount of time he spent on bail and unable to work has raised fresh concerns about the Operation Yewtree. Mr Gambaccini was the 15th person arrested as part of the operation and one of ten released without charge. Critics of the inquiry have branded it a witch hunt. Comedian Jimmy Tarbuck, who was also arrested and released without charge, has called for accusers in sex assault cases to lose their anonymity. Mr Gambaccini has so far declined to talk in depth about what he has described as ‘an horrific ordeal.’ In a statement he said: ‘To discuss horror in this way is to trivialise it. I will never trivialise the 12 months of trauma to which I have been unjustly subjected.’ Mr Gambaccini, who entered into a civil partnership with actor Christopher Sherwood in 2012, has hosted Counterpoint since 2008.","Paul Gambaccini will return to studio on Friday to record Counterpoint .

"Reigning champions Japan strolled confidently into the quarter-finals of the Asian Cup on Tuesday with a 2-0 victory over Jordan in their final Group D match.

Jordan needed an upset victory to have any realistic chance of progressing but were starved of possession before the break and ran out of steam after a strong start to the second half. Japan's neat interplay in the final third was almost irresistible and the four-times champions, who fielded the same starting side for the third straight match, will go into the knockout stages with plenty of confidence. The opening goal came in the 24th minute when Takashi Inui's neat pass set the lively Shinji Okazaki free in the box and when Jordan goalkeeper Amer Shafi parried the striker's shot, Honda was on hand to tap the ball into the net from the angle. It was a first goal from open play after two penalties for Honda, who hit the woodwork three times in Japan's last match against Iraq.

Yuki Muto, who had just come on as a substitute for Okazaki, was set free into acres of space down the left wing and had plenty of time to pick out Kagawa, who side-footed the ball into the net from six yards out.

"Between 1,000 and 2,000 officers have been suspected of tipping off criminals, stealing and fabricating evidence, says a Home Office report. The Home Office Select Committee will launch an investigation next month into police corruption after claims officers also used their power to get money and sex. The probe comes amid a series of police scandals that have related to recent inquiries involving phone-hacking and the Plebgate scandal. A Home Office report revealed that the government estimate that at least 2,000 officers of all ranks could be corrupt (file picture) In a Home Office report analysis by researchers revealed that the government estimate that up to 2,000 officers of all ranks could be comprimising the police by dealing with criminals. The report states that intelligence over a one year period from some forces involved in their research showed that between 0.5 per cent and one per cent of the 200,000 police staff were 'potentially corrupt.' It explains: 'Corrupt activities across these examples have included the protection of criminals for financial payments, the theft and recycling of drugs to criminals, the stealing of money from crime scenes, and the fabrication of evidence to obtain convictions.' It also adds how some officers 'used their powers to obtain money or sexual favours from the public.' Among the corrupt practices listed by the 2003 report are dealing and using drugs, fraud and domestic violence as well using 'sexist, racist and homophobic behaviour.' It also pointed to raids where suspects could have been tipped off because when officers arrived there was no incriminating evidence and they already 'had the kettle on'. Critics say the 2003 Home Office report shows why no Home Secretary Theresa May is trying to tackle historical scandals . The report also adds that corruption could be taking place at all levels and suggests that police should be dealt with behind closed doors if they commit crimes, to make it 'less damaging'. Critics say this Home Office report shows why now Home Secretary Theresa May is having to deal with historic police scandals. Member of the Home Affairs Select Committee and Conservative MP Lorraine Fullbrook told the Independent: 'Labour's kid-gloves treatment of the police bred a lack of accountability which ultimately let down the public. 'There has been a loss of confidence in the police as a result, which is quite dangerous. Theresa is trying to tackle these historic issues to restore the public's trust.' Earlier this year, it also emerged that dozens of corrupt police officers helped organised criminals hide evidence, intimidate witnesses and access details of ongoing operations. Earlier this year, an internal investigation at Scotland Yard by the Metropolitan Police claimed some officers helped organised criminals to hide evidence . An internal investigation by the Metropolitan Police claimed officers were bribed to destroy surveillance logs and some officers even co-owned houses and racehorses with suspected gang leaders. The 2002 report, produced as part of Operation Tiberius, an investigation into police corruption, named 80 corrupt officers. More than half of them were still serving at the time. However, a statement issued by Scotland Yard said said that the Met continued to investigate corruption, and has 'no complacency' about the matter. Policing minister Mike Penning told the newspaper: 'The public expect the police to act with honesty and integrity and it is right that the full force of criminal law is available to punish and deter acts of corruption by police officers.'","Report estimates that up to one per cent of officers are 'potentially corrupt'

"At Tottenham’s training ground, the staff are getting used to Mauricio Pochettino walking around sipping the traditional South American drink mate. He orders the stuff by the box load, sharing it with his coaching staff in the manager’s office as they swap ideas after training sessions. It is a reminder of home and yet Pochettino has already settled into life as the the club’s latest new manager. It feels like a good fit. VIDEO Scroll down for 'Mauricio Pochettino: We're trying to build a philosophy at Tottenham' Everyone's best mate: Mauricio Pochettino has overseen three wins out of three as Tottenham boss . Handshakes all round: Pochettino congratulates Nacer Chadli on a job well done on Sunday . The swagger's back: Emmanuel Adebayor (centre) and team-mates celebrate the striker's goal against QPR . This, remember, is the most political club in the Barclays Premier League, where everybody wants the ear of chairman Daniel Levy. In Pochettino they have a manager without any connections, historical or otherwise, to the club, or loyalty to the players and coaching staff. He arrived without prejudice. The Argentine is a clean break from the club’s past. Glenn Hoddle, Jacques Santini, Martin Jol, Juande Ramos, Andre Villas-Boas and Tim Sherwood were all championed by the chairman when they were appointed. They all left via the back door. Harry Redknapp pretty much cracked it with those two, fourth placed finishes, but the club has to move on from those glorious Champions League nights at some point. This is as good a time as any. Life is good for Pochettino, with two impressive victories in his opening two matches in the Barclays Premier League. At Upton Park, on the opening day of the season, it was important to break the cycle of three successive defeats - ‘The Treble’ as West Ham fans had come to call it - against Sam Allardyce’s team. Last Sunday, when they picked off QPR at White Hart Lane, there was a swagger about their football. That’s what Spurs fans are after and that is what they deserve after so much mediocrity. Pochettino is the man to give it to them after transferring the methods he used so successfully at Southampton to the grander stage at Spurs. More is expected of him now. Inevitably he has repaired the fractured relationship with Erik Lamela, the Argentinian winger who made just a handful of appearances last season. After spending £30m to sign him from Roma last summer, it was important to get back onside. Pochettino, who spoke at length with Dani Osvaldo about the winger (he and Lamela played together at Roma), wasted no time. Lamela, who was 21 when he was signed by Villas-Boas, struggled to settle in London initially. He spent most of last season recovering from a fractured vertebra and vowed to make an impact under Tottenham’s new regime. Erik idol? Tottenham winger Erik Lamela has started this campaign well after a poor first season . Wise words: Pochettino spoke to Dani Osvaldo about Lamela, to try to get the best out of the winger . In the 4-0 destruction of Rangers last Sunday, he showed that he will be able to light up the place with that magic left boot. He is a shy and introverted boy, but Pochettino is determined to bring the best out of him when he pulls on the Tottenham shirt. That is the art of management, something Pochettino was noted for during his spell on the south coast at Southampton. He formed a bond with the best players, sparring with Luke Shaw, captain Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren and Morgan Schneiderlin when they arrived for training each morning. It's all about you: Pochettino (left) points at his coaching staff Toni Jiminez (third right), Miguel D'Agostino (second right) and Jesus Perez (right) during the victory over QPR . Goalden wonder: Chadli heads in to cap a superb move, encapsulating Pochettino's start at White Hart Lane . Pochettino warmed to Shaw, encouraging the left back when he broke into the Southampton team and telling him that he could go on to be one of the best in the world in his position. He also has an exceptional coaching team, with goalkeeper coach Toni Jimenez ranked among the best in the world in this highly specialised position. Jimenez, a former Atletico Madrid keeper, won gold at the 1992 Olympic Games with Spain. By all accounts, he is the business. Miguel D’Agostino and Jesus Perez, who also worked with Pochettino at Southampton, are integral members of his coaching unit. He trusts their judgement, using them as assessors in the opening weeks on the training ground as they worked out the best way to play with the team he inherited. Pochettino’s training sessions are first class, played at high-tempo and in line with the pressing game that he introduced when he was manager at Southampton. He takes the sessions himself. It has been a neat and tidy start to life in north London for Pochettino, bring a smile to the face of Levy after yet another traumatic period at the club. In their sights: Tottenham are determined to sign Morgan Schneiderlin (right) before the transfer deadline . He intends to back the head coach again in the transfer market and the pair are determined to sign Schneiderlin before the deadline on Monday. Before that they play Liverpool, the team who trampled all over them at White Hart Lane last season. Brendan Rodgers’ side scored five without reply in December last year and Villas-Boas was sacked by Levy the following day. This time Liverpool feel vulnerable as Rodgers puts together a new team following the departure of Luis Suarez. Win this one and Pochettino really will be drinking to the future.

"Cover-up claims: Former MP and Lib Dem presidency candidate Liz Lynne at the party's conference in Glasgow last week . A leading candidate for the Lib Dem presidency was yesterday accused of helping cover up Cyril Smith’s vile catalogue of child sex abuse. Liz Lynne, who succeeded Smith as MP for Rochdale, allegedly ordered her PA to destroy several pages of notes containing a stream of allegations against the paedophile. They detailed a litany of abuse at the Knowl View children’s home in Rochdale, which closed in the mid-1990s. The PA, Deborah Doyle, said she had taken the notes during a 1996 telephone conversation with a former manager of the home, Martin Digan. Mr Digan had contacted Miss Lynne’s office in Rochdale as claims of widespread abuse had begun to emerge at the home, where boys as young as ten had been raped. He claimed that Smith knew of abuse at the school and that it was being covered up by both the home and the local authority. But Miss Doyle said her boss did not want to meet Mr Digan and instructed her to get rid of the notes. ‘I was surprised when Lynne said to me, “Don’t put the notes in the bin. Destroy them”,’ said Miss Doyle. ‘I think I took them home and put them on my fire,’ she said. ‘It was the only occasion I can remember when Liz or I did not act on a piece of constituency work, which is why it stuck in my memory.’ Liz Lynne, who was MP for Rochdale from 1992 to 1997, is one of four Lib Dems hoping to take over from Tim Farron as president of the party. Last night she denied all knowledge of the claims. She told The Guardian she had no recollection of notes detailing child abuse allegations that were written or destroyed by a staff member. And she said she did not remember being approached by Mr Digan, who was a former social worker at Knowl View. Earlier this year, the politician told the Mail how she had heard ‘inklings of rumours’ about Smith’s involvement in child abuse – but did nothing about it as she thought the stories were spread by political opponents. The scale of the abuse was revealed in a book earlier this year by Simon Danczuk, the current MP for Rochdale. He said: ‘I am very distressed by this revelation, particularly as I repeatedly tried to contact Liz Lynne to hear her side of the story for our book on Cyril Smith. She never returned my calls and now I know why. ‘If Lynne had acted on the information she was given in 1996 then she could have saved lives as some of the abused boys have subsequently gone on to commit suicide. ‘For years victims have been ignored and Lynne had an opportunity to make a difference and champion their cause. Scroll down for video . Paedophile MP Cyril Smith, pictured in 1971. The scale of his abuse was revealed in a book earlier this year . ‘But she was too afraid to stand up to Cyril Smith and that’s why she’s not fit to be anywhere near frontline politics, especially not as the next Lib Dem president.’ The Guardian reported yesterday that Deborah Doyle, who worked for the former MP between 1995 and 1997, said she took three or four pages of notes from a long telephone conversation with Mr Digan in 1996. Miss Doyle revealed that when she was first offered a job in Miss Lynne’s office, she had to be personally interviewed by Smith. ‘It was like the 1950s. Everything had to go through Cyril, but he wasn’t even a councillor,’ she said. The scale of Cyril Smith's abuse was revealed in a book by current Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk (pictured) Miss Doyle said she left her job after Miss Lynne lost her seat in 1997 and went on to become an MEP for the West Midlands until she stood down in 2012. She was not entitled to redundancy pay, but Miss Lynne gave her £1,000 from her own pocket. She said she told the police about the conversations – but does not know if they were acted upon. She added: ‘Liz is essentially a good person. I am sure that if she had been forced to look into these allegations, she would have been horrified... but at the end of the day she is a politician and may not have felt comfortable taking on Smith.’ Mr Digan was responsible for passing a dossier of evidence to the police which eventually saw the school shut down in the 1990s. He told the Guardian that he had arranged visits with Liz Lynne but they were always cancelled. ‘She never got back to me. The shame is that many abuse victims could have been helped if Lynne and many others had taken the abuse at Knowl View seriously at that point,’ he added. Last night Miss Lynne said: ‘I have no recollection whatsoever of anybody contacting me about allegations against Cyril Smith or child abuse at Knowl View school. ‘If anyone had come to me with serious allegations like that I would obviously have acted upon it.’ Yesterday, at the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow, president Tim Farron appeared to joke about the party’s slew of sex scandals. He said: ‘Of course there are some parts of the job I am happy to pass on. The next time any of you get caught with your pants around your ankles, the media can call someone else to make a comment.’","Lib Dem presidency candidate alleged to help cover up paedophile's abuse .

"Egypt coach Shawky Gharib has blamed Mo Salah's lack of game-time at Chelsea for an African Cup of Nations qualifying defeat to Senegal. Salah was unable to inspire the Pharaohs to victory against Senegal as they went down 2-0 courtesy of goals from Stoke's Mame Biram Diouf and new Southampton signing Saido Mane. And Gharib said Salah - who is yet to play for Chelsea this season - was not fit enough to perform at the level required, with his team-mates also struggling due to the Egyptian league being yet to start. Struggle: Mo Salah couldn't inspire Egypt and that led their coach to speak about his fitness issues . Sudan 0-3 South Africa . Guinea 2-1 Togo . Senegal 2-0 Egypt . Salah initially impressed at Stamford Bridge following an £11million move from Basel in January but has fallen down the pecking order under Jose Mourinho this season with Andre Schurrle, Willian and Eden Hazard preferred in the wide positions. And Gharib seemed to place some of the blame at Chelsea's door following the qualifying defeat on Sunday. 'We had many mistakes in passing the ball and we failed to put the required pressure on our opponents but the defenders are not the only ones to be blamed,' Gharib said, reports ahramonline. Run outs: Salah was used a lot in the early stages of pre season but has fallen out of favour since . 'The poor fitness of the players, especially Chelsea’s Mohamed Salah, is also a reason for the loss. The Egyptian league hasn't started yet and also Salah didn’t play regularly with Chelsea. If Salah is off-form, Egypt's performance is always affected.' Salah will now return to Chelsea for training on Wednesday after the international break but is expected to be excluded from the starting line-up again for their game against Swansea on Saturday. In Chelsea's last game of the season last campaign against Norwich, Mourinho was reported to have criticised Salah in a half-time team talk, telling the Egyptian winger to return for pre-season 'ready to be a footballer'. Out of favour: Jose Mourinho is yet to call on Salah from his starting line up or the bench this season .","Mame Biram Diouf and Saido Mane scored as Senegal beat Egypt .

"These two screen grabs show you just how hard man-marking is — and how bad Manchester United were at it for Didier Drogba’s goal. In the first image, all the Chelsea players are picked up. A split second later and Drogba, John Terry, Branislav Ivanovic and Oscar are all unmarked. Unless you are physically holding somebody — as United did earlier in the game — it is impossible to man-mark someone from a setpiece. The attacker has the advantage and if you switch off for a moment, you are in trouble. That’s why I favour zonal marking. Chelsea's major aerial threats are marked before their corner ahead of the opening goal on Sunday . But as the ball comes in, Chelsea's aerial threats are all in open space and Drogba scores . And having 5ft 8in Rafael marking 6ft 2in Drogba is criminal. Louis van Gaal says Marouane Fellaini is to blame as he was supposed to be marking him but the players should be in no doubt. Ironically, it was the man who was supposed to be marking the space who is most to blame for the goal. Robin van Persie’s position is far too deep, he should be nearer the six-yard line, ready to attack the ball. Instead, when it comes in, he melts away towards the goal-line rather than attacking the ball. At Arsenal we used to put Patrick Vieira in that area as it would take an incredible ball to get past him. United might have to rethink positioning Van Persie there.

"Stephen Gately was found dead in Majorca in 2009 . The family of Boyzone star Stephen Gately are to hire a private investigator for a fresh inquiry into his death because they still have unanswered questions about what happened. Tony Gately, the former singer's younger brother, claims his family never had a full explanation from Gately's partner Andrew Cowles after the Boyzone star was found dead in the apartment they shared in Majorca five years ago. Official reports at the time found he died of natural causes after a fatal build-up of fluid in the lungs, thought to have been brought on by a heart attack. But Mr Gately said his family still want answers about exactly what happened that night. They plan to hire an private investigator after a dispute with Mr Cowles about how the late star's £1.5m estate should be divided up is settled. The family claim Mr Cowles is holding onto Gately's possessions which have sentimental value for them. Gately was found slumped on a sofa in the apartment he shared with Mr Cowles in 2009. The couple had apparently gone out celebrating and had met Georgi Dochev in the gay nightclub, the Black Cat. The trio then went back to the £1m apartment in the upmarket area of Port Andratx. He was found on the sofa the next day in what has been described as a 'prayer-like' position. 'Only two people know what went on the night he died,' Mr Gately told the Sun on Sunday. 'They are his husband Andrew and a Bulgarian guy, Georgi, who was invited to their apartment. Neither of them have fully explained to me what happened.' Boyzone singer Gately met Mr Cowles in 1996 after being introduced by Elton John. The couple had a civil partnership in 2003 and set up home in north London.

Stephen Gately pictured with his civil partner Andrew Cowley (left) at the annual Meteor Ireland Awards in 2006 . After debts were cleared Gately's £3.3m fortune was worth around £1.5m and as he never made a will the majority is expected to go to Mr Cowles, his civil partner. The rest will go to his parents Margaret and Martin but the family are unhappy as they claim Mr Cowles has put a price on some of the star's treasured possessions. Thousands of fans attended Gately's funeral and his coffin was carried by his former bandmates. Mr Gately later travelled with Boyzone to bring his body home. Members of band Boyzone carried Gately's coffin into St Laurence O'Toole Church in Dublin in 2009 . Boyzone (left to right) Keith Duffy, Mikey Graham, Ronan Keating, Stephen Gately and Shane Lynch in 2008 . He added: 'Stephen was everything to me. He was my older brother.' He said he pleaded with investigators after his brother's death to re-open the case so the family could understand what had happened on that day. There is nothing to suggest Mr Cowles or Mr Dochev was involved in the death but Mr Gately said he wants to determine what happened on the night he died. A Majorcan police statement taken from Bulgarian Giorgio Dochev, 25, who was in their holiday apartment that evening, reveals that Gately had smoked a cannabis joint and that the trio had been 'intimate'. An official medical report found had died from natural causes, the medical report recording pulmonary oedema or fluid on the lungs, thought to have been brought on by a heart attack. Police said there were no suspicious circumstances regarding his death.","Boyzone star was found slumped on a sofa in apartment in Majorca in 2009 .

"He is an ‘international security consultant’ and martial arts expert who was Diana, Princess of Wales’s bodyguard and has worked in troublespots around the world. Now Lee Sansum is facing a new challenge – as a minder for Alex Salmond in the final, heated days of the referendum campaign as the First Minister tours Scotland. Pictured standing discreetly, but watchfully, behind the SNP leader, Mr Sansum wears a Yes badge – but insists this is only to help him blend in with the rest of Mr Salmond’s entourage. Bodyguard: Lee Sansum, right, is working as a minder for Alex Salmond, left, on the campaign trail . Past: Mr Sansum, right, on a speedboat with Diana, Princess of Wales  in Saint-Tropez during a 1997 holiday . In 1997 Mr Sansum was Diana’s bodyguard, around a month before her death, during a family holiday to the French resort of Saint Tropez. Despite admiring and liking his latest boss, super-fit former soldier Mr Sansum, who has worked for celebrities including Sylvester Stallone and Tom Cruise, says he has yet to make up his mind on how to vote in tomorrow’s historic referendum. He can command high fees for risky overseas security work – but says he accepted the job protecting Mr Salmond because he wanted to contribute to Scottish political history. In an interview with the Mail, Manchester-born Mr Sansum, 50, who lives in Elgin, Moray, said that he now works for Glasgow-based SecuriGroup which contacted him to request his services guarding Mr Salmond. Discreet: Mr Sansum standing near Mr Salmond during a campaign stop in Inverness . The father-of-four has black belts in karate, jujitsu and kick-boxing and says he has the fitness levels of a 21-year-old, after passing a tough US military test. Reflecting on his work as the First Minister’s bodyguard, Mr Sansum said: ‘It was a bit unusual. I had just returned from Libya, where I was evacuating European peace-keepers on behalf of the EU. ‘The situation over there was tough. There’s still a huge amount of ordnance – shells and missiles which Gaddafi left behind – so it was dangerous 24 hours a day. ‘Brussels made the decision to pull us out, so I was helping with evacuations, and I was among the last to leave. It was quite hairy and a few vehicles were shot up. ‘My wife suggested, because I’d had a couple of close shaves, that I should perhaps find more suitable work in Scotland. Thanks: A letter sent to the bodyguard by Diana after his stint working for her in France . ‘When I got home, the company I work for got in touch and asked if I was free to do some work for Mr Salmond and I was very happy to do it. ‘I’m not doing it for the money – I wanted to make a contribution to Scottish political history.’ Having worked in risky conditions around the world, Mr Sansum said the Scottish referendum had been relatively peaceful. ‘I spent five to six months in Libya with the UN and saw men with AK-47s outside polling stations,’ he said. ‘And polling stations were blown up if they were expected to return the wrong result – so I’m happier dodging eggs than bullets.’","Martial arts expert Lee Sansum was born in England and lives in Scotland .

"Historic sex abuse inquiry chief Fiona Woolf has connections going back at least a decade with Leon Brittan, who is accused of involvement in a cover-up when he was Home Secretary . The controversial new head of the Government’s inquiry into historic sex abuse is under growing pressure as more evidence emerged of her links to a key figure in the scandal. Fiona Woolf has connections going back at least a decade with Leon Brittan, who is accused of involvement in a cover-up when he was Home Secretary. Today we can reveal that the top commercial lawyer sat in the same magistrates’ court as Lord Brittan’s wife Diana for three years. Mrs Woolf was also a senior figure at the Law Society when it hosted a conference addressed by Lord Brittan. She missed the first meeting of the inquiry into alleged VIP paedophile rings on Friday because she was on a business trip to Africa, in her role as Lord Mayor of London. She will also escape a Commons debate on her role after a decision by Lord Brittan’s protege William Hague. Last night campaigners accused Mrs Woolf of treating the investigation with contempt, and called on both her and the Home Office to explain how well she knows Lord Brittan. She has refused to say if she declared her potential conflicts of interest in advance, despite calls in Parliament. The new links come after The Mail on Sunday revealed that Mrs Woolf, 66, has lived in the same upmarket street as the Brittans since 2005; sits on the board of a City conference with the former Minister; gave a £50 donation to his wife for a fun run last year; and judges a business award with her. Lord Brittan is a key figure in the inquiry because of his involvement in the scandal of hundreds of files on child abuse that the Home Office admitted had been lost or shredded. Lord Brittan was handed a now-lost dossier in 1983, which he insists he passed on to officials. Simon Danczuk, the Labour MP who exposed Cyril Smith as a child abuser, said: ‘Both the Home Office and Fiona Woolf need to explain exactly what her relationship is with the Brittans. ‘The more they stonewall, the more suspicious people, particularly victims, will be.’ Mr Danczuk told the Commons he was ‘disturbed’ by the links but his call for a debate was slapped down by William Hague. Now Leader of the House, Mr Hague succeeded Lord Brittan as MP for Richmond in North Yorkshire in 1989 and previously wrote speeches for him. Last night Mr Danczuk said ‘people will draw their own conclusions’ about Mr Hague’s decision. Under fire: Mrs Woolf, left, with Lady Brittan and journalist Martyn Lewis at an awards event . Peter Saunders, of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, added: ‘The links between Mrs Woolf and the Brittans will totally undermine the credibility of the inquiry.’ The Judicial Office confirmed Mrs Woolf had sat on cases at City of London Magistrates’ Court when the chairman of the bench was Lady Brittan. Mrs Woolf became a Justice of the Peace in 2007, while Lady Brittan was chair of the bench until 2010. Officials said it would take too long to check if they ever sat on the same cases. Meanwhile, records show that in October 2005, Leon Brittan gave the opening speech at a conference at the Law Society where Mrs Woolf was vice-president. Mrs Woolf was questioned about her links to the Brittans last week, but refused to answer. She remained in Uganda on Friday when the inquiry she is due to lead met for the first time. The Home Office called it an ‘informal discussion... in accordance with her directions’. A spokesman refused to say if Mrs Woolf had declared her links to the Brittans or not, but said: ‘She is an exceptional and highly qualified candidate for this demanding role.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","More links between historic abuse inquiry chief and Lord Brittan revealed .

"Ready for lessons in her school uniform, and hugging her parents on a family holiday, Katie’s childhood photos are like any other young girl’s. The pictures give no sign of the horrors that awaited her when she met her abuser. At 14, she fell for the man ten years her senior who groomed her into a violent relationship and separated her from her family. Innocent: Katie - not her real name - is pictured aged 11, left, and at 15, right. Now an adult, she has told how she was groomed at the age of 14 by a man ten years her senior and claims authorities did little to help her . Happier times: Katie is pictured on holiday with her parents, aged 12 . Yet council workers and police acted as if she was to blame for getting involved with the convicted criminal, she claimed. She said one officer, attending an incident where her abuser had threatened to kill her, even told her: ‘Well, what did you expect?’ Katie – not her real name – was attacked several times by the man, who had served two jail terms, but said police did nothing to help her and saw the assaults as just ‘a bit of domestic violence’. Her desperate parents had her put into care, hoping it would end the relationship, but she said carers openly allowed him to continue visiting. Yesterday she called on South Yorkshire PCC Shaun Wright, responsible for Rotherham children’s services, from 2005 to 2010, to resign. Katie, now 29, said: ‘He should be ashamed of himself. The more he holds on to his job, the harder it will be for victims to move forward.’ Katie has called on South Yorkshire PCC Shaun Wright (pictured), responsible for Rotherham children’s services, from 2005 to 2010, to resign . She said it was ‘disgraceful’ her abuser was still walking free and that council and police staff had held on to their jobs, adding: ‘I was emotional when I first saw [the report] on the news, but now I am in anger mode – I want justice to be done. ‘When I was 14 and 15 I thought I was in love with him, but when I was 16 I made a statement because there’s only so much you can take.

"Investigation: Sir Cliff Richard with his 'Man Friday' Father John McElynn who is said to be supporting him through the crisis . The BBC was plunged into a new crisis last night after it was publicly blasted by police over its role in the shock Sir Cliff Richard sex abuse investigation. In an extraordinary attack on the broadcaster’s standards, furious South Yorkshire Police accused the Corporation of breaking its own guidelines. The force took the highly unusual step of announcing it had written an official letter of complaint to Director-General Lord Tony Hall over the Corporation’s controversial coverage of the case. The BBC caused a sensation with its coverage when the star’s Berkshire penthouse was searched for five hours last week. The force revealed it had been contacted ‘weeks ago’ by a BBC reporter who had found out about their ongoing top-secret investigation into shock allegations that Sir Cliff had sexually assaulted a boy at a 1980s concert. In an astonishing statement published late yesterday, police said they had been ‘reluctant’ to co-operate with the broadcaster but believed if they did not, the BBC would run the story anyway, potentially jeopardising the highly sensitive investigation. South Yorkshire Police admitted striking an unprecedented deal whereby the BBC would be given exclusive information in advance of the raid – allowing them to show it live on TV – ‘in return for delaying publication’ of their story. Sir Cliff – who strongly denies the allegations – also expressed anger that the BBC was tipped off about the search before he was. Scroll down for videos . Controversial: BBC reporter David Sillito provides news of the raid on Sir Cliff Richard's Berkshire home on Thursday, with police vehicles in the background . The police also blasted the BBC for . its ‘disappointing’ failure to make it clear the police had not been the . original source of the story. And they called for an investigation into . the source of the ‘original leak’ to the BBC, piling on the pressure. South . Yorkshire Police said: ‘A letter of complaint has been sent to the . Director-General of the BBC, making it clear that the broadcaster . appears to have contravened its editorial guidelines.’ Last night, Andrew Bridgen, Tory MP for North-West Leicestershire, said: ‘What the BBC has done . amounts to blackmail. ‘I . think there should be an external inquiry to find out what happened, . not an internal BBC one. This is shocking behaviour by a publicly funded . national broadcaster.’ Last night, the BBC insisted: ‘A BBC journalist approached South Yorkshire Police with information about the investigation. ‘The BBC agreed to follow normal journalistic practice and not to publish a story that might jeopardise a police inquiry.’ Sources . said the publicly funded broadcaster had ‘very unusually’ agreed to the . police’s request on Friday to make clear they had not been the source. Senior figures last night said the televised police raid broke all the rules on contact between press and police. Rank . and file police officers are said to be angry that the BBC – which . suffered a crisis over its failure to expose Jimmy Savile’s abuse – . ‘bounced’ police into allowing cameras and even a helicopter to witness . the search. In other developments, it can be revealed that: . A planned screening of Sir Cliff’s much-loved film Summer Holiday could be pulled from the Bank Holiday schedule by ITV. The . 1963 musical is due to be shown on ITV3 on Sunday afternoon during the . Bank Holiday weekend.An insider said: ‘We will keep the situation under . review and will make any schedule changes that we . deem . appropriate.’ The drama surrounding Sir Cliff began on Thursday . lunchtime when the BBC broadcast exclusive reports that police were . searching a penthouse apartment in Sunningdale, Berkshire, belonging to . the star. Camera crews were . already in place to watch teams of officers in unmarked cars arriving at . the premises, while a news helicopter flew overhead. It . then emerged that South Yorkshire Police were carrying out the raid as . part of an investigation into allegations that Richard had sexually . abused a young boy during a Billy Graham rally at a Sheffield stadium in . June 1985. Under pressure to explain the circumstances of the televised raid, the BBC denied it had been tipped off by the force. Instead, . the police revealed they had been working with the BBC on the . investigation before the pop star’s empty home was searched on Thursday. As of last night, the BBC had received 77 complaints from members of the public about its handling of the case. Of . these, 46 said there had been too much coverage and the other 31 . expressed concern about how the Corporation had known about the police . raid in advance. The elected crime tsar for South Yorkshire, who holds the Chief Constable to account, last night stepped into the growing row. Shaun . Wright, the Labour Police and Crime Commissioner, is said to be taking . the situation ‘very seriously’. He summoned his office’s chief executive . and lawyer yesterday to start drawing up a timeline of what happened, . and will hold a meeting tomorrow to decide what action to take next. A . spokesman for Mr Wright said: ‘In light of the outcomes of the Leveson . Inquiry, the Commissioner will be looking very carefully at the . catalogue of events which took place in relation to this investigation . and any necessary actions will be taken.’ Cliff Richard has already spoken out against the BBC, claiming they were alerted to the raid before he was . Meanwhile, officers within the force were said to be ‘very, very angry’ about the collaboration with the BBC. A . police source said last night: ‘South Yorkshire Police felt they were . being pushed into going in to investigate at this early stage. They felt . very pressurised into doing it. ‘It’s . totally unacceptable to brief the media prior to an investigation . without the condition that there will be no media coverage until the . police have been to an address and secured it. 'For the police to have turned up and found the BBC waiting there for them is unacceptable.’ The BBC declined to comment on allegations it pressurised the force. Sir . Cliff – who is said to be being supported during the crisis by his ‘Man . Friday’ Father John McElynn – emerged from his Portugal villa early . yesterday evening for a game of mixed doubles on his tennis court. Smiling broadly, the star wore a red baseball cap and a white top with the number 72 on. ‘He was clearly trying to get away from his troubles doing what he loves most,’ said a near neighbour. Sir . Cliff said in a statement on Thursday that he had been aware of . ‘completely false’ allegations against him online for many months.

"A British dance instructor turned U.S. TV host who was allegedly shot dead last week by his son-in-law and former lover is now being investigated for sex crimes against young boys. Scott Rogers, 52, who was originally from Suffolk, is believed to have been killed at his Baton Rouge home in Louisiana, by Mathew Hodgkinson who then shot himself in a failed suicide bid. Now officers are thought to be looking into claims that Rogers is responsible for a string of sexual assaults against young boys going back to the last millennium during his time in England. Police are looking into claims that Scott Rogers, 52, who was shot dead at his home in Louisiana last week, sexually abused children while working at a 'cult-like' dance school in the UK . Rogers was well-known in Baton Rouge as the host of feel-good show Around Town, which aired on Saturday and Sunday mornings. Suffolk County Council and Suffolk Police were made aware of the claims before Mr Rogers's death and are assisting inquiries in the US. Today a Suffolk Police spokesman said: 'There were no UK police investigations ongoing into Scott Rogers prior to his death. 'Suffolk Police has so far received a handful of calls from people who have made initial allegations that they were sexually abused by him. 'Detectives will make further contact with these individuals in the next few days to ascertain whether they wish to disclose further information.' Mathew Hodgkinson, 36, is believed to have shot Rogers before turning the gun on himself in a failed murder-suicide bid . Scott Rogers, who was known as Richard Scott-Rogers in the UK, founded the Academy of Dancing and Performing Arts in Bury St Edmunds in 1983. But the school was likened to a 'religious cult' by Suffolk County Council in 1995, and they warned parents of the 'perceived risk' of sending their children there. According to the Bury Free Press, Rogers was acquitted of child molestation charges involving a 13-year-old boy in 1993. Parents also told the paper about 'sleepovers' Rogers would have with some of his young students, during which he would 'cuddle them in their sleeping bags.' In 1995, Suffolk County Council voiced concerns about 'a senior member' of the academy following a High Court case in 1993. In a statement released at the time, the council warned parents of an 'unhealthy atmosphere' at the academy and compared it to that of 'a religious or supposedly religious cult' . It said: 'There was also considerable anxiety felt as to levels of intimacy that existed between the senior member and pupils.' At the time head teacher Rachel Richards denied the claims of 'cult-style brainwashing classes', she said: 'We are just a school teaching the performing arts. Some of our pupils have moved on to appear in the West End theatre and on television. 'People are still coming here for classes from all over Suffolk. We are not involved in any cult activities and to say we are is ridiculous.' Hodgkinson is married to Rogers' daughter, Kimmy, who was also thought to be in the house when the shooting took place last week (pictured, a note found after the shooting) Meanwhile police say Hodgkinson is still in a coma in Our Lady of the Lake Hospital, Baton Rouge after surviving the alleged murder-suicide attempt. Mr Hodgkinson, 36, who was also British, was married to Mr Rogers' daughter Kimmy, and it has been suggested that all three lived in the home where Mr Rogers was shot. A suspected suicide note believed to be written by Hodgkinson was found in Rogers’ home. ‘They broke our happy loving home. They do not get to take Scott too,’ read the note. Any victims or witnesses of alleged sexual abuse should contact Suffolk Police on 101.","Scott Rogers, 52, was well-known in Louisiana as host of feel-good TV show .

"A corrupt dock worker jailed for his part in a drug smuggling ring is the brother of a notorious mother of nine who was jailed for her role in a paedophile gang, it emerged today. Portsmouth dock worker Shaun Wilson, 46, and a team of nine gang members were caught trying to bring 26 kilos of cocaine into Britain, and jailed for a total of nearly 150 years. His younger sister is Tracy Lyons, a 43-year-old mother of nine who was sentenced to four years in prison after admitting a string of child abuse charges including abusing a two-year-old boy and sending the video to a man she met online. Corrupt dock worker Shaun Wilson, 46, left, is the older brother of convicted paedophile, Tracy Lyons, 43, right . The former nursery worker, originally from Portsmouth, was part of an infamous paedophile ring including Vanessa George, Colin Blanchard and Angela Allen, which linked up on Facebook and sent each other vile images. She admitted two counts of indecent assault on a child, inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, and three counts of distributing indecent images of children, but was freed in 2011 after serving half her sentence, much of it served in custody while awaiting trial. Wilson, who said he felt physically sick when he found out about his sister's crimes, was the inside man in an ambitious drug plot based around his knowledge of Portsmouth Docks. Investigators at the National Crime Agency (NCA) said two organised crime groups targeted Wilson, 46, so they could exploit his knowledge of security procedures. Investigators covertly watched as gang members and a dock worker met at service stations and parks to plan out cocaine imports (left to right Errol Heibner, Norman Burton and Shaun Wilson) The men were sentenced to a total of almost 150 years for conspiracy to smuggle million pounds of cocaine into the UK through Portsmouth Docks. (Top row L-R) Richard Edwards, Norman Burton, Audley Powell, Shaun Wilson, Eric Ward, (bottom L-R) Errol Heibner, Jason Flisher, Donald Chambers, David Roberts and Roy Godber) The gangs met him separately on several occasions in service stations, pubs and parks to plan cocaine imports. Each shipment was to be timed to coincide with Wilson's shifts so he could remove the drugs from the docks without detection. However, NCA officers were watching the meetings and swooped when the first shipment - 26kg (57lb) of the drug hidden in a container of pineapples on a boat from Costa Rica - was on its way to the UK in November 2010. The drugs would have had a street value of around £3million. All of the first gang members were arrested and the apprehension of Wilson stopped the second group from succeeding with their plan to bring in another huge haul in a container of bananas. The full extent of the plots was disclosed today when reporting restrictions were lifted after Audley Powell, 56, became the tenth defendant to be sentenced. He was jailed at Winchester Crown Court for eight-and-a-half years. Ten men - nine gangsters and dock worker, Wilson - will serve between eight-and-a-half and 20 years each for conspiring to smuggle in millions of pounds of the Class A drug in exotic fruit containers. Wilson was found guilty in September 2011 of the first conspiracy to import cocaine and was jailed for 14 years. He admitted involvement in the second plot and received a concurrent eight-year sentence. National Crime Agency investigators believe the first shipment they seized was worth £3million on the street . The NCA seized £26kg of cocaine that was stashed inside a pineapple container that set sail from Costa Rica . Gerry McGowan, of the NCA, said:'Wilson abused his position of trust by providing the crime groups with details of suitable ships, routes and times. He was going to ensure he was on duty to guarantee safe removal of the drugs. 'The long term plan was to import vast quantities of cocaine on a regular basis. 'Protecting our borders is a priority for the NCA. We will be relentless in pursuing criminals who try to bring drugs into the country, however long it takes, and wherever they try to hide.' Powell, of Catford, south London, was part of the second group. He was on the run until November last year, when investigators traced him to Jamaica and brought him back to the UK. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to import cocaine in January this year. Two of the gang members involved in the 26kg plot absconded during their trial and fled to Malta, but were convicted in their absence and sentenced to 20 years in prison. The men, Roy Godber, 64, from Rainham in Essex, and David Roberts, 61, from Romford, Essex were tracked down and extradited to the UK in 2013. During the crackdown on drug smuggling, officers found a secret compartment behind a car's number plate . Others sentenced were Jason Flisher, 43, from Folkestone, Kent (16 years), Richard Edwards, 51, from Barking, east London (20 years) and Eric Ward, 51, from Portsmouth (10 years). Those involved in the second gang who were sentenced were Errol Heibner, 69, from Bow, East London and Norman Burton, 57, from Catford, south London, who were both jailed for 14 years. Donald Chambers, from Charlton, was jailed for 13 years. The total of all the men's sentences was 149-and-a-half years. A further two men were convicted of money laundering offences after being arrested at the Channel Tunnel as part of the wider operation. They were handed suspended sentences.","Dock worker Shaun Wilson was key to ambitious cocaine smuggling plot .

"Ed Miliband is under pressure to use his conference next week to present Labour as a credible alternative government . Ed Miliband is today warned by a string of senior Labour figures that he needs to up his game and spell out why and how he thinks he can be Prime Minister. Ahead of his party’s annual conference this weekend, Mr Miliband is also warned that London Mayor Boris Johnson could be his rival as Tory leader by 2015. There is growing unease that after two years in charge, the Labour leader has failed to present his party as a credible government in waiting. Alan Johnson, who Mr Miliband chose as shadow chancellor, today bluntly warns Mr Miliband has not done enough to prove he is up to the job. ‘Whilst I personally don't believe that a prime minister who is more popular than his party can deliver an election victory, it does suggest that Ed Miliband has to do more to demonstrate that he is a leader,’ Mr Johnson wrote in The Guardian. In part due this is due to the ‘age-old problem of opposition parties who struggle to make the news and a leader who has never been tested in the difficult job he aspires to’, Mr Johnson added/ . Meanwhile Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary, admitted Labour are still the ‘underdogs of British politics’ despite being ahead in the polls. Mr Alexander, who ran David Miliband’s leadership campaign, said the party needed to wake up to the threat posed by Boris Johnson. ‘I think it’s time that we take Boris seriously,’ he told the New Statesman. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said his party had to start taking Boris Johnson (above) seriously . Mr Alexander added: ‘It is not yet a probability but it is a possibility that [Boris] will lead the Conservative Party into the next general election. ‘He’s managed to put a smile on voters’ faces quite regularly. People feel he doesn’t play by the rules and doesn’t conform to type.’ In a survey this month, Mr Johnson was named Britain’s most respected politician with a ‘net respect’ rating of +25 points. Former Labour Home Secretary Alan Johnson today warned Ed Miliband had to prove he is up to the job of being leader . Ed Miliband was on -29, well below David Cameron’s -18 points. In what has been seen as a challenge to Mr Miliband’s authority, Harriet Harman told the Spectator that she wants to be the second most powerful figure in a Labour government. The deputy leader told The Spectator: ‘It is my ambition to be deputy prime minister when we are next in government. Unfinished business.’ Mr Miliband’s relationship with the unions will also be thrown into the spotlight next week, when the party conference is urged to condemn the public sector pay freeze which the leadership has said it supports. The Tories have identified Labour reliance on union funding as a key weakness of Mr Miliband’s leadership. Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, was heckled at this month’s TUC Congress when he said that pay was not the first priority when jobs were being lost under the Government's spending cuts. Unison has submitted a motion to Labour's annual gathering in Manchester which attacks the public sector pay freeze and complains that a £250 increase for lower paid workers, announced by Chancellor George Osborne, had only been paid to a minority of employees. It reads: ‘Conference condemns the prolonged pay freezes that mean public sector workers have had their real terms pay cut dramatically and notes that most of the lowest paid have not received the £250 rise that Osborne promised. ‘Conference believes that depressing workers' living standards in a recession is self-defeating and contributes to economic stagnation.’","Ex-Home Secretary Alan Johnson says Ed Miliband still has to prove he is up to the job .

"World-renowned forensic pathologist Dr Richard Shepherd has backed the NSW coroner in finding rock star Michael Hutchence committed suicide. Dr Shepherd recreated the last hours of Hutchence's death and conducted a review of the findings of NSW coroner Derrick Hand for the Seven Network documentary, The Last Days Of Michael Hutchence, which aired on Sunday. Mr Hand ruled out links with auto-eroticism in the death of the 37-year-old INXS lead singer he was found hanged at Sydney's Carlton Ritz Hotel in 1997. His blood contained both Prozac and cocaine at the time he died. Scroll down for video . A world renowned forensic pathologist has recreated the last hours of INXS frontman Michael Hutchence's (pictured here with girlfriend Paula Yates) infamous death for a television series . The finding was disputed by Hutchence's then partner Paula Yates, who died in 2000 from a heroin overdose, who wanted to have the coroner's finding overturned. 'In no way do I accept the coroner's verdict of suicide,' she told the Nine Network's 60 Minutes program in an interview in 1998. 'I will be making it abundantly clear that because of information that I and only I could know about Michael ... I cannot accept the verdict. 'And I won't have my child grow up thinking that her father left her, not knowing the way he loved her.' Dr Richard Shepherd has sifted through the autopsy and toxicology reports related to the famous INXS rocker's death as part of a television documentary that aired on Channel 7 on Sunday . Dr Shepherd told AAP that Hand had arrived at the most logical conclusion and other than Hutchence's well known sexual appetite, there was nothing to suggest he died of auto-eroticism. 'There is nothing I can put my finger on to say this is a sexual thing and there were significant absences of evidence, like soft ligature and pornography,' Dr Shepherd said. 'There is nothing in Michael's case, other than his known sexual activities, which were extensive and frequent as far as I can gather, and that's the only thing that points it in that direction.' Dr Shepherd's documentary into Hutchence's death aired on Sunday and it follows his TV post-mortems on celebrities Michael Jackson, Anna Nicole Smith and Whitney Houston. His expertise was called on for the inquest into the deaths of Princess Diana and UK TV presenter Jill Dando and for the aftermath of the September 11 and Bali Bombing attacks. With the help of NSW Coroner Derrick Hand, who presided over the original report into Hutchence's death, Dr Shepherd was able to create a detailed reconstruction inside the hotel room where the rocker was found . His death was reported by the NSW Coroner to be the result of suicide. The moment he was found in his hotel door with a belt around his neck was reenacted for the documentary . The events leading up to Hutchence's death were charted in the documentary using toxicology reports not previously seen before . Dr Shepherd obtained the toxicology report that was compiled after Hutchence's sudden death and spoke with Mr Hand who has since retired. The UK specialist said Hutchence was under immense stress on several levels and the psychological post-mortem says a lot about the INXS singer's state of mind at the time of his death. At the top of Hutchence's issues was the battle for his only daughter, Tiger Lily, to accompany Yates to Australia. Dr Shepherd said the toxicology report showed there was a mixture of cocaine, alcohol and the anti-depressant Prozac in his blood when he died . Dr Shepherd said his use of Prozac was erratic and led to increased use of other drugs in the years prior to his death . Dr Shepherd said when you couple stress with the issues Hutchence was confronting, then Mr Hand's finding were much clearer. 'Can I entirely scotch every rumour, 99 per cent of them I can, but there is a little gap,' Dr Shepherd said. 'There's all sorts of psychology that go around these hanging related deaths. 'You look at what was happening in his life, the events around him, what was going on with the INXS tour, his private life and with Tiger Lily, Bob Geldof and Paula Yates. 'He hit a low point on his own in that room that night.' The Last Autopsy of Michael Hutchence was one of the most watched shows in Australia on Sunday. A coroner said Hutchence's death was the result of suicide, but girlfriend and mother of his daughter Tiger Lily, Paula Yates, publicly insisted he had died accidentally during a sex game gone wrong .","Renowned pathologist Dr Richard Shepherd has sifted through toxicology and autopsy reports related to Michael Hutchence's death .

"In two minds: Gordon Brown has apparently changed his mind about how he felt when England beat Scotland during Euro 96 . He once described Gazza’s wonder goal against the Scots at Wembley as one of his favourite footballing memories. But Gordon Brown, who no longer courts the English vote, has now spoken of his heartbreak at watching Gary McAllister’s botched penalty for Scotland in that famous Euro ’96 match. In a plea to Scots to vote against independence in September’s referendum, the former Prime Minister said he ‘yields to no-one’ in his love of Scotland. He spoke fondly of his trips with the Tartan Army to Wembley, Spain, Italy and France and recalled Jim Baxter’s skills against then-world champions England in an historic 3-2 victory for the Scots in 1967. Mr Brown also said he was as ‘humiliated’ as any Scot with the rugby team’s massacre at the hands of the Welsh in last weekend’s Six Nations match. 'The only comfort is that we were beaten by Wales, and not England,' he said. His comments, made at an event in Perth where Labour is holding its annual Scottish conference, are a far cry from previous attempts to woo English sports fans when he was Chancellor and Prime Minister. In the run-up to the 2006 World Cup, Mr Brown said: 'Two-thirds of all Scots want England to win, and I’m certainly one of them. '[I have been to] lots of England matches, but the most memorable were the Euro 96 game against Scotland, with Gazza's great goal, and the 0-0 game in Rome the following year when England held on to qualify for France 98.' Heartbreak With England up 1-0, Scotland were given a penalty which Gary McAllister has saved by David Seaman . At the time, SNP leader Alex Salmond said: 'I can't believe that any genuine Scottish football fan could believe that a goal scored against us was his most memorable moment.' But Mr Brown was criticised once again in 2007 when he appeared to back England to host – and win – the 2018 World Cup. He said he would like ‘the host’ to win such a contest, before adding: 'Of course, Scotland will do well.' In the Euro ’96 match between the Auld Enemy, England were leading 1-0 when Scotland were awarded a penalty to level the match. David Seaman saved McAllister’s spot-kick, and the ball was fed to Paul Gascoigne. In a moment of individual brilliance, Gazza then volleyed the ball past Andy Goram to hand England a famous 2-0 victory. Mr Brown said: 'I yield to no one in my patriotic pride in being a Scot. I was there when Gary McAllister missed the penalty. Goal: Paul Gascoigne celebrates scoring a volley which saw England beat Scotland 2-0 during the match . 'I was there when Scotland were playing Brazil in Spain and David Narey scored that goal. I was there in Italy to watch Scotland in the World Cup, and in France to watch Scotland in the World Cup.' He said Scots have made a great contribution to the Union, and said the ‘pooling and sharing’ of resources should continue. Mr Brown also accused the SNP of promising tax cuts for ‘fat Nats’ if Scotland becomes independent. He hit out at Mr Salmond’s bid to cut corporation tax levels, and threw his support behind a ‘mansion tax’ for Scots homeowners and a higher top rate of income tax. Meanwhile, Prime Minister David Cameron has backed Scotland’s bid to host matches for football’s Euro 2020 tournament, which will be staged in cities across the continent.","Gordon Brown has visited Scotland ahead of independence vote .

"Reverend James Ogley, 38, pleaded guilty today to seven charges of publishing obscene material . A vicar has admitted having obscene conversations with children, one as young as 12, on an internet chat log. Reverend James Ogley, 38, who is vicar at Saint Francis Church in Carteret Road, Luton, pleaded guilty today to seven charges of publishing obscene material under the Obscene Publications Act, 1959. Six offences refer to online material from June 2012 and one to publication in November 2012. Ogley, of Hollybush Road in Luton was appointed as the vicar of St Francis in August 2011. He was formerly vicar in the Diocese of Winchester, near Southampton. The vicar was given bail by Judge Michael Kay QC and is due to be sentenced at Luton Crown Court next month. The judge warned him: 'All sentencing options are open.' The vicar was suspended from all his roles as a clergyman in January 2013 and remains so, a spokesman for the Diocese of St Albans confirmed. In a statement, the Diocese said: 'Upon conviction of a criminal offence, the Bishop of St Albans, the Rt Revd Dr Alan Smith, may, under the Clergy Discipline Measure 2003, impose a penalty on a clergyman without further legal process. 'The Bishop will impose an appropriate penalty after sentencing. 'He will take account of what he sees as the gravity of this case and the breach of the trust reposed in Ogley by the church and by the parishioners of St Francis Luton.' Ogley has been vicar at St Francis Church in Luton (pictured) since August 2011. He is due to be sentenced at Luton Crown Court next month . Speaking after the hearing, the Bishop said: 'I am deeply saddened that one of the clergy, of whom I expect the highest standards of behaviour, has committed these offences. 'My prayers are with all those affected by James Ogley's actions and with the people of his parish.' On the church website, it says: 'At St Francis’ we take the responsibility of safeguarding children as priority. We have a child protection policy in place and operate safer recruitment procedures.' Ogley admitted having obscene conversations with children as young as 12 on an internet chat log . Defence barrister Andrew Morton asked for sentencing to be adjourned for probation reports to be prepared. Ogley pleaded not guilty to two further charges of publishing material in April 2012, but those charges will not be pursued and he will not stand trial.

"Journalists know better than anyone the influence social media has today, but it still doesn’t stop them getting into lots of bother for what they say on it. The latest culprit is Fox Sports AFL reporter Julian de Stoop whose Twitter comment comparing Sat Navs and women generated a huge backlash on Tuesday. Twitter followers smashed De Stoop for saying: ‘Given women generally women struggle to read maps it’s a little ironic the voice on the Sat Nav given (sic) directions is a women.’ A hashtag saying ‘confused’ was attached. It was all supposed to be a bit of harmless banter on Twitter but Fox Sports AFL reporter Julian de Stoop soon found himself in hot water . Mr De Stoop joked about women's voices being used in Sat Navs it did not go down well . Match Review Panel felt de Stoop should use a self monitoring compass . Alan Baaff wondered out loud who would be the AFL journalist to replace him? If he wanted a response he got one as Twitter followers lined up to give him stick.

"Some 40,000 Iraqi refugees face starvation after being forced into hiding on a barren mountain top by a circling band of bloodthirsty jihadists. They must now decide whether to descend and risk being slaughtered or hope their attackers are defeated before they die of thirst or hunger, officials said. They were driven from the town of Sinjar by ISIS over the weekend and have already been forced to bury at least 20 children who succumbed to the harsh conditions on Mount Sinjar. Scroll down for video . Bleak: Iraqi Yazidi women who fled ISIS in the Iraqi town of Sinjar take refuge in the Kurdish city of Dohuk. Around 40,000 other Yazidis have been forced to the top of a mountain by the militants . Forced into hiding: An Iraqi Yazidi family that fled the violence in the northern Iraqi town of Sinjar sit at a school where they are taking shelter in the Kurdish city of Dohuk in Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region . Marzio Babille, the Iraq representative for the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said: 'There are children dying on the mountain, on the roads. 'There is no water, there is no vegetation, they are completely cut off and surrounded by the Islamic State. It’s a disaster, a total disaster.' One of those trapped, 23-year-old Shihab Balki, texted Loveday Morris from The Washington Post to say he had witnessed several deaths over the last few days. 'I saw their bodies with my own eyes,' he wrote. Their plight came as the UN Security Council warned that ISIS may be held accountable for crimes against humanity for its systematic persecution of minorities in Iraq. The council singled out the group's attacks on the strategic city of Tal Afar near the Syrian border, which it seized in June, and neighboring Sinjar, which it captured on Saturday, for condemnation. ISIS issued an ultimatum to tens of thousands of people from the Yazidi community on Saturday to convert to Islam, pay a religious fine, flee their homes or face death. Yesterday, the extremist group posted images on social media showing the moment it stormed Sinjar. One picture showed several men lying face down in a field with a gun pointed at their heads, with the caption: 'Kill them wherever you find them.'

Barren: Mount Sinjar, where thousands of Yazidi families have been forced to flee from Islamic militants . Yazidis follow an ancient religion with links to Zoroastrianism. At least 40 children from those displaced from Sinjar were killed in the violence in the area, UNICEF said yesterday. Kurdish fighters from Iraq, Syria and Turkey were co-ordinating operations in northern Iraq to reclaim areas lost to the jihadists and rescue thousands of civilians stranded in the nearby mountains, it was reported by AFP. Iraqi helicopters have dropped some supplies, but officials warned the process of providing safe passage would take days. The UN security council condemned the Islamic State group and associated armed groups 'in the strongest terms' for attacking and killing minorities, including Christians, as well as Iraqis who oppose their 'extremist ideology.' The radical Islamist militants went on a lightning offensive last month, crossing from territory they hold in Syria and capturing a large swath of northern and western Iraq, in co-operation with local Sunnis who have long distrusted Iraq's Shi'ite dominated government. Marauding: ISIS has posted pictures of its takeover of Sinjar on social networking sites . The Security Council said in a press . statement approved by all 15 members that the group poses a threat not . only to Syria and Iraq 'but to regional peace, security and stability.' It . expressed deep concern for the hundreds of thousands of people . displaced, many from vulnerable minority communities especially the . Yazidis who have lived in the area for hundreds of years. The . Security Council said many Iraqis from Tal Afar and Sinjar have been . forced to flee and seek refuge 'while many others have been executed or . kidnapped.' Council members . noted that 'widespread or systematic attacks directed against any . civilian populations because of their ethnic background, religion or . belief may constitute a crime against humanity, for which those . responsible must be held accountable.' Ruthless: One picture shows men lying face-down in a field, with a gun pointed at their heads with the caption: 'Kill them wherever you find them' They stressed that all parties, including the Islamic State group, 'must abide by international humanitarian law, including the obligation to protect the civilian population.' Iraq's government has been struggling to unite to confront the threat from the extremists, and it has yet to choose a new prime minister. Council members called on all Iraqi communities 'to unite to respond, with the support of the international community, to this violent and senseless threat to Iraq's unity, identity and future.' The council specifically called on all political groups to overcome divisions and work together, and for the country's leaders 'to engage as quickly as possible to form a government that represents all segments of the Iraqi population and that contributes to finding a viable and sustainable solution to the country's current challenges.' The Security Council urged all 193 UN member states to implement and enforce targeted U.N. financial sanctions, an arms embargo and travel ban on the Islamic State group and associated groups and individuals.","Families from Yazidi minority forced from homes by Islamic militants .

"A 14-year-old boy has been identified as the first of 55 bodied dug up on the grounds of a former Florida boys' school decades after they died allegedly of neglect and brutality. University of South Florida researchers said Thursday that remains belonging to George Owen Smith had been exhumed from the grounds of the renamed Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys, an institution with a troubled history where the facilities were often decrepit and guards were accused of brutality. In December 1940, Owen Smith's mother wrote the superintendent of the then-Florida Industrial School for Boys about the welfare of her 14-year-old son, who had been sent there months earlier for being with a friend in a stolen car. Scroll down for video . George Owen Smith, pictured, the first victim positively identified from one of the 55 unmarked graves the former Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys in Marianna, Florida . University of South Florida Associate Professor Erin Kimmerle, right, gestures as she stands with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, center, and Ovell Krell during a news conference Thursday . Frances Smith received a letter from superintendent Millard Davidson, saying no one knew where Owen was. A month later, the family was summoned to Florida Panhandle school and led to an unmarked grave. Owen was in it, they were told - he had escaped and was found dead under a house. Frances Smith never accepted the story. She waited for him to come home. Sadly, the researchers were unable to determine how Owen did in fact die, and they will probably never know. Owen hastily buried in a two-foot grave, lying on his side with his hands over his head, they said. He was unclothed other than a shroud. His family says he will soon be reburied next to his mother and father in the central Florida city of Auburndale. 'This is what we worked for,' said his sister, Ovell Krell, now 86. 'It was not an easy road.' The identification was made through a DNA sample collected from Krell. This December 20, 2013, file photo provided by the University of South Florida, shows where researchers found some of the remains of 55 people in a graveyard . Associate Professor Erin Kimmerle, center, facing camera, is pictured during the excavation of bodies late last year . Official records showed 31 burials at the Marianna school between its opening in 1900 and its 2011 closure for budget reasons, but researchers found the remains of 24 additional people between last September and December. Some former students from the 1950s and 1960s have for at least a decade accused employees and guards at the school of physical and sexual abuse, but the Florida Department of Law Enforcement concluded after an investigation that it couldn't substantiate or dispute the claims because too much time had passed. Many former Dozier inmates from that era call themselves 'The White House Boys' after the white building where they say the worst abuse took place. In 2008, the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice held a ceremony to officially 'seal' the building and recognize the boys who passed through it. Some of 'The White House Boys' were present and media coverage of the event, as well as an order from then-Governor Charlie Crist, led to the investigation. Researchers, reacting to the allegations, excavated the graveyard at the school. Ovell Krell, sister of George Owen Smith, the first victim positively identified, gathers up an undated family photo of George, after a news conference Thursday . Krell said her older brother would wear a guitar string around his neck and that the family would sing country-western songs for entertainment. He hadn't been in trouble before the stolen car, she said. Over the years, the family had kept his wallet, which was displayed at Thursday's press conference. 'It was important to him and I often wondered why he left it,' Krell said. The wallet had a Junior G-Man card, which was tied to a popular radio program that featured a former FBI agent. At its peak in the 1960s, 500 boys were housed at the Dozier school, most of them for minor offenses such as petty theft, truancy or running away from home. In 1968, when corporal punishment was outlawed at state-run institutions, then-Governor Claude Kirk visited and found the institution in disrepair with leaky ceilings, holes in walls, cramped sleeping quarters, no heating for the winters and buckets used as toilets. Ovell Krell, sister of Owen Smith, talks of her brother who was 14 when he disappeared from the school in 1940, and was never seen alive by his family again . 'If one of your kids were kept in such circumstances,' he said then, 'you'd be up there with rifles.' Some of the bodies were found under roads or overgrown trees, well away from the white, metal crosses marking the 31 officially recorded graves. Erin Kimmerle, the lead researcher and an associate anthropology professor, said another body could soon be identified. Officials have said it's unclear if there are other graves elsewhere on the school site. The team excavated only five of the property's 1,400 acres. Jerry Cooper, who is head of a White House Boys group, said the circumstances of Owen's disappearance and the way he was buried support their contention of abuse. 'I want an apology from the state for what happened there, but so far no go,' said Cooper, who was sent there as a teenager in the early 1960s for riding in a stolen car. He has said he suffered horrible beatings with a leather strap in the White House. 'If they apologize, they are admitting guilt and they aren't going to do that.'","University of South Florida researchers said George Owen Smith's remains had been exhumed from the grounds of Arthur G.

"Jean Charles de Menezes, who was mistakenly shot dead by anti-terror police in July 2005 . The family of the Brazilian mistakenly shot dead by anti-terror police were allegedly spied on by undercover Scotland Yard officers. Members of the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS) gathered information on relatives who were campaigning for justice following the death of Jean Charles de Menezes, 27. His family are reported to be among at least 12 spied on by officers from the now defunct unit. They include relatives of Cherry Groce, whose shooting by police triggered the 1985 Brixton riots, and relatives of an Asian man called Ricky Reel, 20, who died in mysterious circumstances after falling into the Thames in south west London in 1997. The scandal-hit police unit also collated sensitive details about the family of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence during their justice campaign in the late 1990s, it emerged earlier this year. Details of the alleged intrusion suffered by Mr de Menezes’s relatives are expected to be outlined in a hard-hitting report to be published today. It will attack undercover police units for gathering and keeping information about black justice groups that ‘served no purpose in preventing crime’. According to Channel 4 News, Mr de Menezes’s family had their privacy breached by undercover Met officers in the aftermath of his death at Stockwell Tube station in south London in July 2005. The electrician was shot seven times in the head by officers who mistakenly thought he was a terrorist. An inquest jury later found the Met guilty of health and safety failings. Mr de Menezes’s family received about £100,000 compensation from the force and depending on the level of intrusion by undercover officers, could now be in line for a further payout. Scotland Yard declined to comment last night. Channel 4 News claimed at least 12 families have been contacted by the Met to say they appear in reports and notes kept by the SDS, which was disbanded in 2008. Today’s report by Derbyshire Chief Constable Mick Creedon will say that neither the families nor their campaign were the target of undercover officers, but that information about them was reported and retained, when it should have been discarded. Labour MP Diane Abbott said that the spying claims concerning the de Menezes family ‘fatally undermine confidence’  in the police. Mr de Menezes's cousins, Patricia da Silva Armani and Alex Pereira. It is alleged his family were spied on by undercover Scotland Yard officers . Sukhdev Reel, the mother of Ricky Reel, told Channel 4 News: ‘Rather than them helping us pick up the pieces trying to find out what happened to us they were spying on us. I don’t understand it, I just feel I’ve been stripped of my dignity… I feel really angry.’ Mr Creedon was called in to lead an inquiry after a series of allegations were made about the SDS, including that officers used the identities of dead children without permission and tricked women into serious sexual relationships. He said last night: ‘My report is very clear that criticism must be levelled at the Metropolitan Police for keeping information, which had been gathered by undercover officers, which served no purpose in preventing crime or disorder.’ A spokesman for the Jean Charles De Menezes Family Campaign said last night: ‘It begs the question – what exactly were they spying for? ‘We can only assume they were gathering information in an attempt to discredit the family’s campaign for justice in order to deflect accountability for their own failings.’","Allegations family of shot Brazilian were spied on by undercover officers .

"Isis today overran a cluster of predominantly Christian villages in Iraq alongside the country's semi-autonomous Kurdish region, sending tens of thousands of civilians and Kurdish fighters fleeing from the area. Militants were seen pulling down church crosses and burning manuscripts during violence that has alarmed the Baghdad government and regional powers. The mainly Christian town of Tilkaif, as well as Al Kwair, were overrun by militants, according to witnesses, and residents of Iraq's biggest Christian town, Qaraqosh, fled before the arrival of the Islamist fighters. Scroll down for video . Iraqi volunteers who joined government forces to fight against Isis hold a position at a checkpoint in Udhaim, in the Diyala province, north of the capital Baghdad . A member of the Kurdish peshmerga takes his position holding a rocket-propelled grenade launcher during an intensive security deployment against Isis . Kurdish peshmergas guard the border to prevent the attacks of armed groups led by Isis . Vigilant: Kurdish peshmergas patrol in Mahmur . This advance brings Isis to the very edge of the Iraqi Kurdish territory and its regional capital, Irbil. France's Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said France was 'very deeply concerned by the ... seizure of Qaraqoush, Iraq's biggest Christian village, and by the intolerable abuses committed.' He asked that the international community mobilizes itself against the threat and brings help. The Isishas already seized large chunks of northern and western Iraq in a blitz offensive in June, including Iraq's second-largest city of Mosul. The onslaught has pushed Iraq into its worst crisis since the 2011 withdrawal of U.S. troops. The al-Qaida-breakaway group since has imposed a self-styled caliphate in territory it controls in Iraq and Syria, imposing its own harsh interpretation of Islamic law. Iraqi government forces and allied Sunni tribal militiamen have been struggling to dislodge the Isis militants with little apparent progress. Bishop Joseph Tomas, who is based in the Kurdish-held city of Kirkuk, said the Isis pushed into Qaraqoush and four surrounding hamlets - Tilkaif, Bartella, Karamless and Alqosh - on Wednesday was in control of them on Thursday. Iraqi government volunteers take up positions at a checkpoint in Udhaim . Islamic militants parade in Beiji, some 155 miles north of the capital, Baghdad, in late July . Kurdish peshmerga units, which had protected the area, fled along with civilians, Tomas said. Other priests contacted by The Associated Press, confirmed the information. The raid started late Wednesday, and by 10 p.m., most Kurdish fighters had pulled out, said Father Gabriel, a resident of Alqosh. The Christians and members of other minority groups ran for their lives, with tens of thousands heading to Kurdish northern Iraq, he added. 'All Christian villages are now empty,' said Bishop Tomas. When Mosul fell into the militant hands, the Isis gave members of the many ethnic and religious minorities an ultimatum to convert, pay a tax or leave. Those who did not obey risked death. The peshmerga units had initially managed to stall the militant advances, but their defense waned in recent weeks as the Isis group intensified efforts to expand its territory. On Monday, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki ordered the Iraqi air force to provide aerial support to the peshmerga, in a rare show of cooperation between Baghdad and the Kurdish regional government that underscored the serious nature of this crisis. In Batella, one of the hamlets overrun overnight, Kurdish fighters and local Christian security guards went knocking on people's doors, urging them to leave, said Um Fadi, who only gave her knickname, fearing for her own safety. A government employee who fled from Mosul with her family for refuge in Batella more than two weeks ago, Um Fadi said she was in despair. 'Our situation is miserable,' she told the AP by phone on Thursday. 'We do not know what to do or where to go.' The head of the Kurdish regional government, Nechirvan Barzani, urged Iraqi Kurds 'not to panic but to remain calm,' stay where they are and continue their 'normal work and life.' Last week, the Isis also seized the northwestern town of Sinjar, forcing tens of thousands of people from the ancient Yazidi minority to flee into the mountains and the Kurdish region. Pope Francis has called for world governments to take measures to protect Christians driven from their villages in northern Iraq and provide them with humanitarian aid. In a statement, Francis appealed to the international community to 'put an end to the humanitarian drama underway, adopt measures to protect those who are threatened by violence and assure them necessary aid, especially urgent for those who are homeless and depend on the solidarity of others.'","Terror group Isis has overrun several Christian towns in northern Iraq .

"Allegations: Sir Cyril Smith is alleged to have used his status to sexually abuse young boys with impunity at Knowl View School in Rochdale . Police are set to launch a criminal investigation into an alleged cover-up of child abuse at a school linked to Sir Cyril Smith. The . Lib Dem politician, who died aged 82 in 2010, is alleged to have used . his status to sexually abuse scores of young boys with impunity at Knowl View . School in Rochdale. But despite repeated complaints by his victims and previous police inquiries, he and others have never been prosecuted. A separate investigation is ongoing to identify suspects who actually took part in the alleged sexual abuse. Now, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) are set to investigate whether their own . officers and local politicians were part of a cover-up of what was going . on at the time. The latest inquiry was sparked by Labour’s . Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk, who claimed in a recently published book that . Smith raped a number of young . boys at the residential school. Police, . spies and politicians helped to hide the historical child abuse carried . out by Smith, according to Mr Danczuk’s book, Smile For The Camera: The . Double Life Of Cyril Smith. This left the . 29-stone former Rochdale MP free to abuse children as young as eight . despite 144 complaints by victims, Mr Danczuk and co-author Matthew . Baker said. Today, Assistant Chief Constable Ian Wiggett, of GMP, said: 'Following the publication of MP Simon Danzcuk’s book ""Smile for the Camera"", GMP conducted an assessment of the allegations contained within that book. 'As a result of the assessment, GMP decided that a criminal investigation was required. 'The GMP investigation will now seek to identify whether any offences have been committed in the way that previous reports of abuse were handled or allegedly covered up. 'The main concerns relate to the response to child abuse over several decades connected to Knowl View School in Rochdale. Investigation: Greater Manchester Police (GMP) are set to investigate whether their own officers and local politicians were part of a cover-up of what was going on at Knowl View School (pictured) at the time . 'We have consulted with the Home Office in relation to the national inquiry that has been announced into how organisations responded to child abuse, but as these matters relate to criminal allegations in the GMP area, the responsibility to investigate them falls to the Chief Constable.' Mr Wiggett said that the allegations relating to the past involvement of police officers have been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). He added: 'In addition, we have established an independent oversight panel to demonstrate the independence and rigour of the investigation that we will be conducting. 'If there are further allegations that relate to the conduct of police officers, these will similarly be referred to the IPCC, as we are required to do.' Claims: The inquiry was sparked by Labour MP Simon Danczuk (right), who claimed in his book, Smile For The Camera: The Double Life of Cyril Smith (left), that Smith raped a number of young boys at the residential school . Fourteen . suspects have been questioned as part of the inquiry into alleged sexual offences committed at . Knowl View School between 1969 . and 1990. The claims relate to the alleged abuse of pupils by both adults at the residential school and among the boys themselves. Earlier this month, it was revealed that prosecutors ruled there was a realistic chance of convicting Smith of child sex offences 12 years before he died. But they advised against bringing a case because the politician had been assured decades earlier that he would not face charges. Escaped justice: Earlier this month, it was revealed that prosecutors advised against bringing a case against Smith (pictured), former Rochdale MP, because the politician had been assured he would not face charges . Documents made public also revealed that police knew of three potential witnesses to Smith’s abuse but failed to interview them. Lancashire Police first investigated Smith in 1969 over complaints that he abused eight teenage boys at a hostel in Rochdale. But the then Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Norman Skelhorn, rejected the case, ruling the following year that the allegations were ‘somewhat stale’ and ‘completely without corroboration’. In 1998 the Crown Prosecution Service was asked to review the original file of evidence. Peter Watson, Crown prosecutor for Rochdale, noted in his ruling at the time that the alleged victims living in the hostel all complained of ‘virtually the same type of indecent misconduct’ and had given consistent accounts. He concluded: ‘I have arrived at the firm view, having regard in particular to the number and nature of the complaints and how they came to be made, that there would be a realistic prospect of conviction.' But shockingly, the prosecutor went on to recommend against charging Smith because police had told him back in March 1970 that he would not face further action. Today, Mr Danczuk said: 'I welcome the fact that GMP are taking what’s in our book seriously. It is clear to me that crimes have been committed, though I hope the police will prioritise the arrests of abusers who are still alive over whether council officers covered this up. 'That is what the victims have told me is their priority. They want to see those who inflicted terrible abuse on innocent children brought to justice.'","Sir Cyril Smith allegedly sexually abused young boys at Knowl View School .

"British companies sold chemicals used to make lethal nerve agent sarin to Syria in the 1980s, ministers will admit today. In the week that the US has started the process of destroy Syria's stockpile of chemical weapons, it has emerged that the UK supplied the country with key elements for making them. It is a major embarrassment for the British government, after condemning the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime during the bloody three-year civil war. British firms were the sole suppliers of three chemicals that Syria used in the production of sarin. A member of UN investigation team is pictured in Damascus last year taking samples of sands after reports of a chemcial weapons attack . U.N. chemical weapons experts wearing gas masks carry samples from one of the sites of an alleged chemical weapons attack in the Ain Tarma neighbourhood of Damascus . Ministers will today rush out a statement to the Commons on historical exports to Syria. According to BBC'S Newsnight, a leaked Foreign Office document said the phosphate chemicals used to manufacture sarin were supplied in the mid 1980s. A Government spokesman said controls have been tightened since the chemicals were sold. A report by the UN last year found that in one particular incident in Damascus 'chemical weapons were used on a relatively large scale, resulting in numerous casualties, particularly among civilians and including many children'. While President Bashar al-Assad's government was accused of being behind chemical attacks during recent years of fighting, he has always denied this, blaming opposition forces. David Cameron was defeated in a Commons vote last year on ordering British military intervention in Syria. He argued that the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime crossed a 'red line' and the rest of the world could not stand by. Syrian President  Bashar al-Assad agreed to hand over his stockpile of chemical weapons after being threatened by the US with military action . In what was thought to be an unprecedented parliamentary reverse over British military action, Tory rebels joined with Labour to inflict a humiliating defeat on the Prime Minister. However, after the US threatened missile strikes in retaliation for a chemical attack on a rebel-held suburb of Damascus, Syria agreed to surrender its arsenal. The material handed over by Syria included mustard gas and precursors to the nerve gas sarin. On Monday the Pentagon said the destruction of the chemical weapons on board the US cargo vessel MV Cape Ray had begun. It is expected to take about 60 days to destroy the approximately 600 metric tons of material loaded onto the ship. Last month Syria handed over to Western powers the 1,300 tons of chemical weapons it acknowledged possessing. Prime Minister David Cameron suffered a humiliating defeat in the Commons last August, when MPs refused to back British military action in response to Syria's use of chemical weapons . Documents handed passed by Syria to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) reveal details of how chemicals used to produce sarin came from the UK. British firms were the the sole supplier of dimethyl phosphate (DMP), trimethyl phosphate (TMP) and hexamine - three chemicals that Syria used in the production of sarin, the BBC said. In addition to hundreds of metric tonnes of the chemicals, in 2003 Britain sold electrical fans to Damascus which were used in the manufacture of sarin. A Government spokesman said: 'We do not comment on what are alleged leaked documents. 'Officials have been reviewing historical Government records on exports to Syria including from the 1980s, when we know Syria was building its chemical weapons programme and importing goods from a range of countries, with a view to an announcement in Parliament . 'Export controls have been tightened very significantly since the 1980s.'","British firms sold dimethyl phosphate, trimethyl phosphate and hexamine .

"Nigerian women are being trafficked to Italy hoping for a better life – but often end up working the streets as prostitutes. Their plight has been highlighted by Paris-based photographer Elena Perlino, originally from Italy, who began to notice the presence of young African women working on the streets during her commutes from Turin. She said: 'I decided to start from this surreal vision to tell a story. I have been working on the topic for several years, focusing mainly on the Italian connection.' Police control find a Nigerian woman working as a prostitute in the outskirt of Turin . Nigerian woman Fatima shows the scars on her body due to vicious fighting with collegues working as prostitutes in the outskirts of Acerra . A Nigerian in Italy waits for a client in the countryside during the winter season . A Nigerian cultural mediator offers condoms and psychological support to some of the younger prostitutes working close to Acerra . Perlino reveals that many Nigerian women come to Italy hoping to make enough money to support their families back home, but often they get trapped or tricked by traffickers into working in the sex trade. Arrests, violence and abuse often follow. Traffickers demand on average more than 50,000 euros (US $60,000) for travel expenses and accommodation, with the women having to work as prostitutes until their debts are paid off. As Claudio Magnabosco, former official of the European Parliament, explained: 'The women are still coming: they are younger than ever and arrive here with massive debts to pay off. 'They are forced into prostitution and are now increasingly reinventing themselves as madams or working for the traffickers, also trafficking men, children for adoptions and organs and drug dealing. 'These are the activities of the powerful Nigerian mafia, which is also involved in arms dealing. What has changed is that the madams are now less violent towards the girls, having understood that if they mistreat them the girls run away: the girls forced into the sex industry now get to keep a little of the money they earn and this makes their lives a little bit more tolerable. 'As they cannot find a real way out, they get used to life as prostitutes and prostitution becomes their only source of income.' Nigerian women working as prostitutes in the North area of Turin .

"Lord Tebbit last night joined those demanding an explanation over the missing dossier detailing claims of a Westminster paedophile ring. The former Tory Cabinet minister spoke out as the clamour grew for a full-scale inquiry into historical child abuse. More than 130 MPs are now calling for an investigation into allegations that have left former home secretary Leon Brittan facing questions over his handling of the dossier. Pressure: Former Tory Cabinet minister Lord Tebbit is demanding an explanation from Lord Brittan over the missing dossier which detailed allegations of a paedophile network within Parliament and Whitehall . Lord Brittan has confirmed he received a ‘substantial bundle of papers’ from MP Geoffrey Dickens in 1983 – which detailed allegations of a paedophile network within Parliament and Whitehall – and passed them to his officials for investigation. But amid claims of an Establishment cover-up, the Home Office admits the dossier was either lost or destroyed. Lord Tebbit, a fellow member of Margaret Thatcher’s Cabinet in the 1980s, said yesterday: ‘He should deal with the accusations which have been made. People will then have to assess for themselves.’ Asked whether he thought Lord Brittan had dealt with the dossier in a proper manner, he said: ‘It would depend on the relationship he had with his officials and also what he told them. I don’t know whether he said, “Christ you should go away and look at this stuff”, or whether he said, “This is nonsense, go and bin it”.’ Lord Brittan had said he could not remember receiving the dossier from Mr Dickens but on Wednesday released a statement confirming he had been given it, asked officials to look into the claims and could not remember hearing any more about it. However, a 2013 Home Office review revealed that he had written to Mr Dickens in 1984 saying the dossier had been handed to police. Lord Brittan then released a second statement saying he had only just been made aware of the review, which proved that appropriate action had been taken. Labour demanded an investigation into the way the Home Office handled the evidence in Mr Dickens’s dossier. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the 2013 Home Office review was carried out by two officials and took only four weeks. ‘This is not good enough,’ she said. ‘The lack of proper answers from the Home Office is just increasing the confusion.’ Document: Lord Brittan has confirmed he received a ‘substantial bundle of papers’ from MP Geoffrey Dickens in 1983 . Among at least 133 MPs who have added their names to calls for an inquiry are more than a dozen Liberal Democrats, in defiance of their leader Nick Clegg, who said the abuse claims were ‘stomach- churning’ but that police should be left to investigate them. Labour’s Michael Dugher, one of Ed Miliband’s key lieutenants, said: ‘The Home Secretary should step in now, in the light of several reports, and establish an overarching inquiry led by child protection experts to draw together the fragmented investigations so we can make sure vulnerable young people are listened to and better protected.’ Former children’s minister Tim Loughton said he would consider, if necessary, using parliamentary privilege to name high-profile people accused of child abuse. Labour MP John Mann said it looked bad that there were independent inquiries into historic child abuse at the BBC and the NHS but that one for Westminster was being denied. Mr Dickens, who died in 1995, told his family the dossier details would ‘blow the lid off’ the lives of powerful and famous child abusers, his son said. Barry Dickens told the BBC the Tory MP would have been ‘hugely angered’ that the allegations had not been properly investigated. A child abuse campaigner who worked closely with Mr Dickens said the missing dossier could have toppled the government of the day. Dianne Core, who founded the charity Childwatch in the 1980s, would not reveal the names of the alleged Westminster paedophiles she believes were in the file. But she claimed some belonged to Mrs Thatcher’s government – and called on David Cameron to help end the cover-up. ‘This file will never see the light of day because it could have brought a government down. It will have been shredded and burned,’ she said. Keith Vaz, the Commons home affairs select committee chairman, said he would not call Lord Brittan to give evidence, adding: ‘People shouldn’t look for conspiracies.’ But Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who helped expose the full extent of Cyril Smith’s paedophile attacks in a book serialised by the Daily Mail, said: ‘What has emerged from Tuesday’s select committee hearing is that Lord Brittan has questions to answer about what happened to the Geoffrey Dickens dossier. ‘The muddled statements issued by Lord Brittan have shed little light on this. Instead of clearing up this issue, they’ve generated more questions about where the dossier is and what he knows about the wider issue of establishment paedophile networks.’ Why I'm ready to name names, by former children's minister TIM LOUGHTON . Fears: Former children's Minister Tim Loughton says the continuing allegations is undermining public confidence in children's safety . Every week seems to bring some horrific new story about historical child abuse. The avalanche of allegations is confusing and frightening, and this latest story undermines public confidence in our children’s safety even further. After a major dossier concerning child sex abuse was handed to the Home Secretary Leon Brittan in 1983 by one of his own MPs, the files which named suspected paedophiles disappeared without trace. No one knows whether this was a criminal cover-up or incompetence, but conspiracy theories that followed were inevitable. Along with scores of my colleagues in the House of Commons, I believe there is only one way to quell the nationwide fears over our children and to ensure that the perpetrators of sick crimes are brought to justice, even if the offences occurred decades ago. There must be a full Parliamentary inquiry. Already 130 MPs have signed up to this. The Government is resisting us — this afternoon, I received a letter from Home Secretary Theresa May informing us that she is ‘not minded’ to set up the inquiry, although she says she is not ruling anything out. An overarching inquiry means a co-ordinated examination of the facts. It must be a commission of respected figures from the legal system, Parliament, social services and children’s charities; an independent inquiry with the power to demand evidence and summon witnesses. It would have an overview of all the historical cases of child sex abuse going back to the 1960s. An inquiry must address four main issues: . Like many in Westminster, I was gravely concerned by the news the dossier compiled by Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens, who spent his career fighting child abuse, had been lost. Inevitably there is conjecture that someone deliberately lost it or hushed it up. Who did this? Were they politicians, civil servants, or police complicit in a cover-up? It could be mere incompetence. No one knows, and it is gravely damaging to both the police and Parliament that we can’t get to the facts. Some people say we should not dig under these stones, for fear of what we might find. That’s rubbish. This issue is not going to go away: we cannot reassure people by saying we will not investigate the past. Transparency is the only way to restore public confidence. We have one major advantage in our fight to force a public inquiry. Since these stories started coming out, a lot of victims have come forward. There were 500 victims of Jimmy Savile alone, some of whom had gone to the police before and been dismissed. These people have not had their stories heard. An inquiry will unearth first-hand evidence from people. How long it will take before the Government is dragged, kicking and screaming, to agree to an inquiry, I don’t know. I know David Cameron has a deep interest in combating the cancer of child abuse. But if he doesn’t act quickly, there is a risk that this campaign will become party political and the truth will be swamped under a barrage of mudslinging. There will be those who will want to know why I and my colleagues do not use Parliamentary privilege to name and shame suspected paedophiles in the Commons. I call it the nuclear option, and it might come to that. But we don’t want to compromise any police investigation. We need to make sure police have had every opportunity to pursue evidence. It is deeply frustrating, but some patience has to be exercised. Meanwhile, we must not remain silent. The louder our demands for a public inquiry into all the facts, the better our chances of bringing the abusers to justice – and making sure this appalling travesty can never happen again.

"It was the day of reckoning for dozens of looters and rioters who have reduced our streets to lawlessness. But while the trouble has been largely blamed on feral teenagers, many of those paraded before the courts yesterday led apparently respectable lives. A postman, a primary school  mentor, lifeguard, charity worker and a father of a newborn baby were among defendants appearing alongside schoolchildren and college students to answer charges ranging from theft to violent disorder. Some wept, some grinned and others merely stood in blank defiance at the magistrates. A very misguided youth: An 11-year-old boy walks from Highbury Magistrates Court with a woman, thought to be his mother, right. Left, the same boy outside the court carrying TWO mobile phones . The youngest looter was an . 11-year-old boy who arrived at court in North London accompanied by his . mother clutching a mobile phone in each hand. He was convicted of an . unrelated offence only last week and is yet to begin his punishment. Should rioters have their benefits taken away from them? One of the eldest defendants was a . 35-year-old new father, who claimed he was trying to buy nappies when he . was wrestled to the ground by police in a ransacked supermarket. The majority of yesterday's suspects . poured through courts in London but many more were expected in the dock . over coming days in Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and Nottingham. At one magistrates' court, staff were . preparing to work through the night as cells overflowed and suspects . were left sitting outside in a queue of police vans. One official said there were 'mad . scenes' as colleagues battled to deal with some of the 371 people . charged by the Metropolitan Police. Many of those in court were young men . apparently caught red-handed with stolen TVs, laptops and mobile phones . worth thousands of pounds. They were joined by supposedly . respectable professionals and tradesmen whose lawyers said they had been . caught up in a 'moment of madness' as anarchy took hold of the streets. Some stood accused of attempting to incite rioting with incendiary messages on social networking sites. Judges refused to grant bail in the . majority of cases, telling suspects they must face a Crown Court judge . who can impose stiffer punishments. They were told they must remain behind bars to prevent them joining in fresh unrest. In a handful of cases rioters were . dealt with on the spot, including two rioters who were jailed in .

Thugs caught looting and rioting could be thrown out of their social housing, a council said today.

Housing minister Grant Shapps has backed moves to evict tenants who have taken part in criminal and anti-social behaviour but lawyers have said it may not be that easy. The council must show that the disorder happened in the immediate area around the property - and the individual must have been found guilty in the crown court. Jonathan Glanz, Westminster Council cabinet member for housing, told the Guardian: 'Social housing isn't a right, it's a privilege and if people abuse that privilege then in common with anyone else they should face the consequences. 'Families have to take responsibly for children living in their households, and we have a responsibility to our communities at large.

"Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg this morning rejected calls for a Hillsborough-style inquiry into historic sex abuse allegations - despite growing concern over the disappearance of a dossier detailing explosive claims of sex abuse by paedophiles within Westminster. Mr Clegg said the police should be in charge of getting to the bottom of what happened to vulnerable children in care homes, following claims that high profile individuals were part of a paedophile network targetting children. The Lib Dem leader's remarks came after former Home Secretary Leon Brittan admitted receiving a file containing allegations of a child abuse network operating in Westminster. He said he was given the file by the late Conservative MP Geoffrey Dickens in 1983 and launched an investigation into the claims. Nick Clegg said child sex abuse allegations should be handled by the police and rejected calls for a Hillsborough-style public inquiry . A dossier detailing explosive claims of sex abuse by paedophiles within Westminster has gone missing. Given to Home Secretary Leon Brittan in 1983, the files allegedly exposed a vile network at Parliament and Whitehall . Lord Brittan, 74, is now facing questions over his handling of the document and inconsistencies in his account of what he did with it.The Tory peer told journalists last year he had no recollection of being given the dossier. But in a statement yesterday morning, he changed his mind. He confirmed he was handed a ‘substantial bundle of papers’ by Mr Dickens in November 1983 and passed them to his officials for further investigation. He said: ‘I do not recall being contacted further about these matters by Home Office officials or by Mr Dickens or by anyone else.’ Hours later Lord Brittan amended his account again after proof emerged that he had written to Mr Dickens in March 1984 informing him the dossier had been assessed by prosecutors and handed to police. Home Office officials say they have searched for the dossier but cannot find it. Last night Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who has challenged Lord Brittan to explain how he dealt with the allegations, demanded to know what police had done with the information provided by the late Mr Dickens and called for a Hillsborough-style public inquiry into historic sex abuse. But Mr Clegg, who worked for Lord Brittan in Brussels when the Tory peer was a European Commissioner, rejected Mr Danczuk's call. He said: 'I would support anything that helps get to the truth and crucially delivers justice for those victims who - if these horrific allegations fo abuse in in childre's homes in various parts of the country turn out to be true - have suffered for years in silence, and their plight has gone unrecognised. 'My view is, given the very serious criminal nature of these allegations - namely that there was a circle of people who hid what they were doing, that what they were doing was abusing vulnerable children in children's homes - the only way to deliver justice, even in the years afterwards, is allow the police to get to the bottom of these things. 'That's why I would urge anybody who has any information, any evidence which they think might be relevant to this, to pass it to the police. 'The police already - as you probably know - are conducting inquiries into the children's homes in the north west, in south west London and elsewhere. 'I really want to see the police see that through. So that for me, I think, is the absolute priority for anybody who wants to see justice done.' The Tory peer told journalists last year he had no recollection of being given the dossier. But in a statement yesterday morning, he changed his mind. He confirmed he was handed a 'substantial bundle of papers' by MP Geoffrey Dickens (pictured) in November 1983 and passed them to his officials for further investigation . Mr Clegg said he could not provide 'too much additional insight into what happened in the Home Office in the mid-1980s'. But he added: 'My understanding is as Leon Brittan explained yesterday - and the Home Office explained - when he was Home Secretary, information was passed on and the relevant bits of information were passed onto the prosecuting authorities and the police, and that the Home Office is not in possession anymore - following an independent trawl through the records conducted last year - is not in possession anymore of the full documentation.' He added: 'Most importantly I want to see the police getting to the bottom of what was alleged to have happened - which is absolutely horrific in some of the children’s homes up and down the country. Mr Clegg said: 'I just want the truth to come out and justice to be done and I think when we are dealing with something of such a criminal nature - I don’t think there is any surrogate really for allowing police to get to the bottom of what happened.' But Labour's Mr Danczuk said Lord Brittan needed to explain what happened to the dossier. Mr Danczuk said: ‘The impression conveyed is that Sir Leon does not want to talk about this. It goes right to the heart of an attitude in politics that child abuse is a subject best avoided. 'He should reveal what he knew at the time about paedophile networks and what action he took.’ The Rochdale MP – who helped expose the full extent of Liberal MP Sir Cyril Smith’s paedophile attacks in a book earlier this year, serialised by the Daily Mail – is calling for a Hillsborough-style inquiry into child abuse allegations against politicians. Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who has challenged Lord Brittan to explain how he dealt with the allegations, demanded to know what police had done with the information provided by the late Mr Dickens . A lawyer representing alleged victims of abuse at the south-west London Elm Guesthouse reportedly named in the dossier, criticised the loss of the document. Alison Millar, head of the abuse team at Leigh Day, said: ‘My clients are incredulous at how this dossier can have simply disappeared. It seems inconceivable that a document of such importance can have simply disappeared. ‘I would strongly support the calls for a widespread inquiry into historic sexual abuse so that my clients could have their many questions answered about who knew what and that a very troubling veil is lifted from the corridors of power.’ The Prime Minister’s official spokesman declined to back Mr Danczuk’s demands for an over-arching inquiry – a call which has garnered the support of 120 MPs. He said independent inquiries were already under way into allegations relating to the BBC and the NHS. But when asked whether there should be an independent inquiry into allegations of Westminster paedophile rings, he referred to last year’s Home Office review. The Rochdale MP - who helped expose the full extent of Liberal MP Sir Cyril Smith's (pictured) paedophile attacks in a book earlier this year, serialised by the Daily Mail - is calling for a Hillsborough--style inquiry into child abuse allegations against politicians . Asked to comment on the Dickens dossier, Scotland Yard said last night: ‘The Metropolitan Police is currently assessing information and conducting a number of investigations under Operation Fairbank. Any material submitted to us, historic or current, is reviewed to establish if it is relevant to these.’ Tim Loughton, former children’s minister, told Channel 4 News: ‘In order to restore confidence in our child protection system, because things have got a lot better, we need an overarching inquiry that puts all this into context and makes recommendations so we can make sure we have a child protection service that is fit for purpose. ‘The victims must come first. And those many victims, many hundreds if not thousands who have been suffering often in silence going back to the 60s, 70s, 80s who have been emboldened to come forward. 'At last we are listening to them and their stories are being taken seriously but we need to find out why they weren’t taken seriously when these offences happened.’","Lord Brittan, 74, is facing questions over handling of 'explosive' document .

"Paedophile: Elvis impersonator Louis Fella, pictured in costume, admitted child pornography charges . An Elvis impersonator who sang for Sir Elton John at a celebrity party has been exposed as a paedophile. Louis Fella - stage name Louis Rockafella - performed his tribute act for celebrities, on national television and in front of thousand-strong audiences in Las Vegas. But he was this month exposed as a paedophile when a cache of more than 900 images of child abuse - some of which he had made himself - were found on his computer. The court was told that some of the images seized by investigators were graded levels four and five - the most severe - on the SAP scale. Images of this severity usually show sex between children and adults, sadism or even bestiality. Fella pleaded guilty to pleaded guilty to 12 counts of making indecent images and seven counts of distributing images between November 2009 and April 2013 at Liverpool Crown Court. The court heard that the impersonator, who boasts of having won Elvis look- and sound-alike competitions, even shared his collection with other paedophiles over the internet. Fella, of Southport, Merseyside, was granted bail but banned from having unsupervised contact with any child aged under 16. He will be sentenced on July 17. On his website, Fella says his 30-year career began when he was just 12 years old. He goes on to describe his 12-year stint with the Army before returning to music. Fella appeared in a 2002 BBC documentary, There’s Only One Elvis, to mark 25 years since the rock 'n' roll legend's death. Impersonator: Fella performed for Sir Elton John and in front of crowds of Elvis fans in Las Vegas .

"People living in the port city where a U.S. ship is docked ahead of its mission to destroy Syrian chemical weapons say they are worried about potentially dangerous leaks. Residents of the town next to the southern Italian port of Gioia Tauro say they have been kept in the dark about the chemical weapons being shipped in. Despite official reassurances, they fear the potential impact that any leaks may have on their health or the environment and accuse the government of lumbering them with the consignment. Mayor of San Ferdinando Domenico Madafferi: He said local people had been kept in the dark over the hundreds of tons of chemical weapons being transported to their city from Syria to be decomissioned . The MV Cape Ray arrived in Gioia . Tauro today for the unprecedented transfer and destruction of about . 1,300 tons of Syrian chemical weapons. The . 648ft U.S. government cargo ship has been fitted with two machines . designed to neutralize the most toxic chemicals, including mustard gas . and the raw materials for sarin nerve gas. The chemicals were handed over by the Syrian government as part of a deal with the international community to destroy its chemical weapons. The most dangerous chemical weapons will be transferred from the Danish vessel Ark Futura to the Cape Ray, which will move into international waters for the destruction. Other material will be taken to toxic wastes sites in various countries for disposal. Kept in the dark: People sunbathe on the beach of San Ferdinando, next to the giant Gioia Tauro port . But on the eve of the ship's arrival, residents and officials from Gioia Tauro and nearby towns voiced concern about potential environmental contamination as a result of the transfer. They also complained that they hadn't been told what exactly would be taking place near their homes. 'We live this situation with uncertainty and resignation because for the last four months we continued to ask for information about it but they didn't give it,' said Domenico Madafferi, mayor of the nearby town of San Ferdinando. He told Italian paper La Stampa: 'People are fed up and it’s not true that they support it. 'We’re not even sure about the materials being transported…Some people speak about the lethal impact of iprite [mustard gas] and sarin, others are even claiming that the entire load of weapons is ready for use.' He accused the Italian government of 'making it rain on the heads' of people on Calabria, which is one of the country's poorest regions. Carabinieri patrol the port's perimeter: . Locals fear the potential impact that any leaks may have on their health or the environment and accuse the government of lumbering them with the consignment . While the disarmament process is risky from beginning to end, those in charge have insisted that equally hazardous chemicals are neutralised on a daily basis around the world. But the claims are scant reassurance to residents aware that Albania, Norway, Belgium and France had all refused to host the stockpile before their own government accepted it. Destroying chemical weapons at sea is unprecedented, but U.S. officials told the Associated Press that the process is a proven, safe way to neutralise toxic chemicals. The officials said no vapour or water runoff will be released into the atmosphere or sea as a result. Mission: The US cargo ship MV Cape Ray after it arrived docked at Gioia Tauro early this morning . Bolted into the Cape Ray's cavernous cargo hold are two machines called Field Deployable Hydrolysis Systems. They consist of mazes of tanks, tubes, cables and electronics that will mix the Syrian chemicals with heated water and a cocktail of other chemicals in a titanium reactor to render them inert. More than 60 experts needed to operate chemical destruction machinery, as well as security and support staff, are expected to be on board to oversee the process. The operation marks the first time the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has overseen the destruction of a chemical weapon stockpile in the midst of a raging civil war.","Local mayor says people have been kept in the dark about the operation .

"Rangers are fighting an attempt to force them to pay the £250,000 fine levied for the oldco Ibrox club’s widespread use of undisclosed payments to players. A commission set up by the Scottish Premier League handed oldco Rangers the fine in February 2013 after the club failed to disclose dozens of payments worth millions of pounds from 2000 to 2011, breaching league rules. The commission decided Rangers had gained no sporting advantage and stopped short of stripping the club of titles and it appeared the issue was over as the fine was levied on a liquidated company. Rangers are fighting an attempt to force them to pay the £250,000 fine levied for the oldco Ibrox club’s widespread use of undisclosed payments to players . But Rangers say the Scottish Professional Football League - the result of a merger of the SPL and Scottish Football League - is now trying to recover the fine. A Rangers statement to the stock exchange read: 'The board of the SPFL has determined that Rangers Football Club Limited is liable to pay the EBT Commission fine of £250,000 levied on RFC 2012 PLC (previously The Rangers Football Club plc) (in liquidation). 'The SPFL has also decided that this sum will be recovered from the club by the SPFL withholding broadcasting money and other sums due to the club but which are paid in the first instance to the SPFL. 'An appeal has been lodged with the judicial panel of the Scottish FA which has confirmed that the decision of the SPFL is suspended pending the outcome of the appeal subject to the SPFL’s right to object. Mike Ashley has found himself in trouble after apparently breaking rules about dual ownership . 'The board is advised that the sum is not due to SPFL and the appeal will be pursued vigorously.” The payments were related to the club’s tax-avoiding Employee Benefits Trust scheme and totalled £9million in one season alone. Former owner Murray International Holdings has largely won two court cases against Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs over the scheme, with another one planned, but the commission focused on the club’s use of undisclosed side letters to players rather than the legality of the payments. Newco Rangers assumed liability for the liquidated company’s football debts when the club’s SFA membership was transferred in July 2012 but it was widely thought that the new fine would not affect the current Ibrox regime. The Scottish Football Association made an agreement with Ashley in 2012 to limit his influence at the club . Meanwhile, Rangers say they will also fight another case with the SFA. The club and shareholder Mike Ashley were this week hit with a total of five charges following the SFA’s investigation into the Newcastle owner’s dual interests. A second statement to the stock exchange read: 'The directors of Rangers will take legal advice with a view to defending the actions of the company and the club robustly in relation to those matters raised by the SFA.' Both announcements came on a day when the Ibrox board is expected to meet to decide the fate of manager Ally McCoist, who last week triggered a 12-month notice period in his contract by handing in his resignation.","Commission set up by SPL hand oldco Rangers £250,000 fine .

"By ZOE HARCOMBE . Last week, there was  a headline in the news-papers that felt like a ray of hope. 'Skimmed milk doesn’t stop toddlers getting fat,' it read. Well, hallelujah. It doesn’t stop adults  getting fat either — in fact, I’d argue the opposite, that skimmed milk and other low-fat dairy produce can make you fatter. Here’s why. Fat tastes great for good reason: it keeps us alive and it is uniquely satiating — it makes us feel full. If I ever get given a skinny cappuccino by mistake, it not only tastes gross but it doesn’t satisfy me. Step away from the latte! Drinks made with skimmed milk don't help you lose weight - they do the opposite . A large milky coffee can nicely bridge the gap between an early breakfast and a late lunch. It  feels substantial. Skimmed milk has no such ability to satisfy the appetite. The same goes for a reduced-fat yoghurt, or low-calorie cheese substitute. Put bluntly, if you don’t eat enough fat, you won’t feel full — if you feel constantly hungry, you’ll keep  eating and get fatter. Sounds simple, doesn’t it? But it took me years to make this connection. In my late teens and early 20s, I started every day in fresh hope that I would be 'good', and being 'good' would make me slim. But I thought 'good' meant dutifully counting calories, avoiding fat, and trying to exist on four large apples and a box of Fruit Gums daily,  which adds up to about 700 (fat- free) calories. Needless to say, my body craved the fat and nutrients I was so sorely lacking, and I would find myself bingeing uncontrollably and gaining weight steadily, despite my overwhelming desire to get thinner. Later, I became an obesity researcher — as an unsuccessful calorie counter, I had an insight into the diet- and-binge cycle that most  overweight people seem to be trapped in. I tried to understand why two-thirds of us are overweight, when all we want to be  is slim. My single biggest discovery was that trying to eat less makes us eat badly. Ever since scientists first estimated the calorie values of the components of food, we have understood that carbohydrate and protein provide approximately four calories per gram, while fat approximates to nine. Calorie counters know these numbers and see fat as the  bad guy. They want the biggest bang for their buck — the most food for the  fewest calories. But my big box of Wine Gums and its 400 empty calories were giving my body nothing that it needed — no essential fats, no protein, no vitamins, no minerals. Any lifelong dieter will count calories, but any successful dieter will keep consuming healthy fats and concentrate on controlling carbohydrates. The biggest difference between the two types is that the successful dieter’s approach enables them to eat real food — the stuff that our bodies have evolved to consume. Drink up! Full fat milk is a better choice for slimmers and those in search of a healthy diet alike . The ideal amount of body fat is 3 to 5 per cent for men and 10 to 16 per cent for women. Our planet has provided all the nutrients we need in the natural food around us — if we shun eggs for processed breakfast cereal, or steak for a sandwich full of additives, these calories won’t count towards health in anything like the same way. It’s hardly surprising, therefore, to read that a study of 11,000 toddlers has found that two-year-olds who drink full-fat milk are less likely to be overweight or obese by the age of four than those on low-fat milk. It concluded that this might be because higher-fat milk makes children feel fuller for longer, so they eat less of other foods as a result. The whole-milk children are also getting the nutrients that they need, in a way that their bodies can deal with, so they’re not seeking out more food to fill the nutritional gap. Full-fat dairy produce is a vital source of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K — particularly the first two. Dairy is a great source of calcium and phosphorus —  the minerals that work  with vitamin D for  bone health. The term 'fat-soluble' means that these vitamins need to be delivered in or with fat for the nutrients to be available to the body. That’s why nature puts fat-soluble vitamins in foods containing fat — how clever. So man removes the fat to make low-fat milk and thereby removes the nutritional delivery mechanism — how stupid! Very few of us get enough vitamin D, which is so vital to our health. We are seeing a re-emergence of rickets in children in the 21st century, thanks to our crazy public health advice that demonises fat, cholesterol and sunshine — the three most important things our body needs to obtain vitamin D. Worrying: Obesity is on the increase in the UK - a fact Zoe puts down to too much fat avoidance . Better: Meals cooked from scratch without processed ingredients and with small doses of fat are healthier . Removing the fat in dairy is bad enough. Sometimes that is all that manufacturers do (for example, with skimmed milk). Sometimes they do worse — they remove the nutritious fat and replace the lost taste with sugar (yoghurts are the main victims of this practice). Mouth-wateringly scrumptious, creamy Greek-style yoghurt containing healthy natural fats is turned into a fat-free, sweetener-laden apology for a treat and the calorie counter who eats it thinks they are being good to him or herself. They’re not. Besides, have you read the nutritional info on a carton of milk recently? ‘Full fat’ milk is a measly 3 to 4 per cent fat. Even to an ardent calorie counter, that hardly makes it a high-fat food. Of all the misconceptions about food that litter the media today, the one that has harmed humans the most is the idea that fat makes you fat. It was the Seventies demonisation of fat that directly led to  government advice to ‘base your meals on starchy foods’. Until  this point we used to think  that starchy, carb-heavy foods were fattening (our grandmothers still do). Since this change, obesity in the UK has increased from  2.7 per cent of men and women (1972) to 22.6 per cent of men and 25.8 per cent of women in 1999. Coincidence? And while UK obesity levels have increased almost tenfold, saturated fat intake has fallen from 51.7g per person per day (1975) to 28.1g (1999). The National Food Survey also informs us that we consume a quarter of the whole milk that  we used to, and consume six to seven times more reduced-fat dairy produce. As we have eaten more carbs and less fat we have become more obese and less healthy.If only we could return to the real food, whole milk, meat and two veg world of little more than a generation ago, we could maybe return to their enviable figures and waist sizes. So, whether you think of your slimmer ancestors or those tubby toddlers, the message is clear: eat real food. That means real dairy products — not brightly coloured, plastic-looking processed cheese but brie oozing off the plate. Not sugared, sweetened, artificially coloured stuff in a pot called yoghurt, but plain, natural, nutrient-rich, stand-your-spoon-up-in-it proper yoghurt. The real thing is more filling, more nutritious and way more delicious — and the evidence is overwhelming that we were slim when we ate it and we’re fat now we don’t.

"With her flowing robes and long hair swirling in the water around her, this woman could be King Arthur's Lady of the Lake. These captivating photographs illustrate a different legend, however. This is a recreation of the 'Lady of the Orda Cave', a spirit said to inhabit the world's longest underwater cave in freezing Siberia. Scroll down for video . Ghostly: This is a recreation of the 'Lady of Orda Cave', a spirit said to inhabit the world's longest underwater cave . Beautiful: The project is the brainchild of award-winning photographer Victor Lyagushkin. He admitted the dive is risky but that the reward was 'to see something that nobody has seen before' The cave lies beneath Russia's Ural Mountains and the waters are so clear you can see for 50 yards. Former champion free diver Natalia Avseenko spent two days in the icy water recreating the myth with the help of other cave divers. The 37-year-old held her breath for up to three minutes at a time at depths of 17m while posing in flowing robes on top of a wet suit. Despite the chill and the threat of danger, she described her experience as 'incredible', mysterious and beautiful'. Harsh conditions: Temperatures inside the cave reach -23C while the water is 5C . Dangerous: Ms Avseenko found the shoot demanding and it took its toll causing significant pain to her exposed eyes and face . Eerie: Ms Avseenko held her breath for up to three minutes at a time to depths of 17metres while posing in flowing robes . She said: ‘It felt as if I was in Alice in Wonderland.' ‘I was scared to enter the cave at the beginning but having squeezed through the narrow entrance I entered a beautiful hall. ‘It . felt as if I was in a natural cathedral. I thought it would be dark and . scary inside but I had light and everything was visible. ‘There is a feeling of being in complete silence and harmony. There are no thoughts inside your mind. ‘I . realised the greatness of nature and the universe. I was full of joy . and harmony. All the fears were disappearing one by one. I had no inner . battles and I just let all my inner-garbage go.’ Team work: A diver lets Ms Avseenko breathe from his oxygen tank on the dive . The setting: A support diver swims through the crystal clear waters of Orda Cave in the Ural region of Russia . Taking in the view: Free diver Natalia Avseenko watches the horizon outside Orda Cave, where the temperatures can reach -40C, in the Ural Mountains . Frozen: Ms Avseenko, 37, walks into the depths of the chilly cave. She spent two days in icy water recreating the myth of the 'Lady of Orda Cave' with the help of other divers . Conditions were harsh with . temperatures reaching -40C outside, while inside the cave was slightly . warmer at -23C and the water itself at a less-than-balmy +5C. Yoga . expert Ms Avseenko, who has previously held her breath underwater for . 10 minutes and 40 seconds, found the shoot physically demanding. Diving without face equipment took its toll causing significant pain to her exposed eyes and face. The . project was the brainchild of award-winning photographer and filmmaker . Victor Lyagushkin, 42, who has led previous expeditions to capture the . eerie beauty of the crystal cave. He . uses an underwater funnel to stop oxygen bubbles damaging the delicate . edges of the cave, which are made of gypsum - a soft calcium mineral. Route planning: Photographer Victor Lyagushkin maps out the route the divers will take for the shoot at Lake Orda . Costume change: Ms Avseenko prepares for her dive (left) into the depths of Lake Orda before putting on a wig and clothes on top of a wet suit (right) Final touches: A diver helps Ms Avseenko as she enters the water in full costume . The project sprung into life after Mr Lyagushkin, from Moscow, came across a legendary tale about a spirit dwelling in the depths. Some divers will even decide not to dive on a certain day they feel a presence or tiny glitches with their equipment. One diver describes the feeling as an 'inquisitive, jealous and purely female glance... like an elder sister'. Despite this slight foreboding, every risk was calculated to ensure maximum safety for everyone involved. Freezing: Ms Avseenko wraps up warm after her dive.

"Police used a house filled with hidden cameras and tempting electronic and designer goods to catch burglars in a crime-ridden neighbourhood. Officers covertly filmed teenage thieves after they smashed their way into a bugged house and exclaimed with delight as they scooped up Armani trousers, an Apple iPod and a Sony mobile phone, as well as money. The camera footage was used to convict three juveniles of burglary and led to a drastic reduction in burglaries in the north Birmingham suburb of Erdington. Scroll down for video . The hidden cameras recorded the burglars telling each other what they found as they ransacked the house . Here one of the gang, his face blurred out by police, is caught gloating as he helps himself to a watch . In the police footage, which was first broadcast this morning, a trio of youths can be seen making their way around a house baited with cash and expensive goods. As they nose around the sitting room, one exclaims: 'Watch...some change'. Another says: 'Taking the iPod, MP3...', then adds: 'There's the phone'. His accomplice asks: 'What phone is it?' and is told it is a Sony Ericsson 'W8'. The burglars move on to another part of the house and one picks up an item of clothing, saying: 'Pair of Armani's, man'. Later, one of the gang says: 'I want to go upstairs, there'll be more upstairs.' One burglar is filmed checking with his friend: 'You got the phone, ain't you?' while another revels in his pickings, saying: '...got the dough for tomorrow anyway'. The hooded burglars are showing helping themselves to a mobile telephone they find laid as bait . The burglars' greed is plain to see as they make their way around the 'capture house' in north Birmingham . One of the thieves instantly identifies the phone as a Sony Ericsson W8, a highly-covetable android mobile . West Midlands police were alerted to the burglary in process via motion sensors in the bugged house, and swooped on the property while the youths were still ransacking it. The trio were caught and later charged with burglary and found guilty, receiving suspended sentences. The bugged house was the idea of West Midlands police Inspector Dave Keen, who was charged with reducing the 'blight' of burglary in Erdington. The burglars are in no rush as they methodically ransack the house, scooping up every last penny . They are filmed leaving the sitting room and going upstairs in search of more treasures to steal . One of the gang is filmed marvelling at a pair of designer trousers he has found in the baited house . He said: 'We were suffering probably two or three burglaries each day in what was a particularly tight, small area. 'It's a horrendous crime to suffer - I've been a victim of burglary in the past myself and it does really shatter that experience of feeling safe at home.' The police were lent an empty house by the local council, and filled it with discreetly hidden CCTV cameras, before strewing around various tempting goods including an android mobile telephone, iPod, MP3 music player and designer clothes. The hidden police cameras, pixellated here by officers, gave detectives crystal-clear shots of the thieves' faces . The burglars were all subsequently charged and found guilty of burglary, and received suspended sentences . Going upstairs for more: West Midlands police had filled the house with hidden cameras . The cameras in the house were motion sensitive, and once movement was recorded by thieves breaking into the house, officers were alerted by text.  The text allowed them to dial straight into the house's cameras on their mobile phones, so they could watch the burglars live at work. Insp. Keen said the cameras were just one of the high-tech tools police were using to clamp down on burglars. He said: 'We also use forensics marking spray . on door handles, window frames, sills and property which has a ‘bar . code’ unique to that can – so anyone found with that marking liquid on . them can’t deny having been inside the house. Inspector Dave Keen, of West Midlands Police, said burglaries dropped dramatically after their sting operation . Police officers could watch the burglary live in process on their mobile phones thanks to the hidden cameras . 'Our capture houses have proved very . effective both in catching and helping convict offenders, plus deterring . burglars…we want thieves to know they could easily pick the ‘wrong’ house and fall straight into police hands.' Following the apprehending of the three burglars in Erdington, police noticed a dramatic reduction in similar crimes in the area. Insp Keen said: 'It puts the fear back onto the criminal rather than on the house or the victim'.

"The German government has been forced to hand over hitherto secret documents that expose the flaws of the euro - and the misgivings of European politicians - in the years before it became a reality. Der Spiegel news magazine made a successful request for the release of the euro files at a time when the odds on Greece quitting the common currency within 18 months rise to 75 per cent and the chances of a complete shattering of the eurozone have never been higher. Born in 1998 and introduced across the continent four years later, the euro was always a time bomb waiting to go off. Many of Helmut Kohl's aides had huge doubts at the time - and pinpointed Italy as the weakest link. Firefighting: The odds on Greece quitting the common currency within 18 months are now 75 per cent and the chances of a complete shattering of the eurozone have never been higher . 'The documents from the Kohl administration, kept confidential until now, indicate that the euro's founding fathers were well aware of its deficits. And that they pushed ahead with the project regardless,' said Spiegel when it broke the news of the great euro con trick on the people of Europe today. Hundreds of pages of German government documents from 1994 to 1998 stated clearly that Italy - now one of the floundering southern European euro states - should not have been allowed to join. Later on the files bring up another country that was poised for catastrophe: Greece. Aides warned Kohl - who, along with De Gaulle in France relentlessly drove the European Project onwards as a bulwark against future war - that Italy's austerity measures taken at the time were merely 'window dressing.' Early doubts: Newly released documents say that before the euro currency was introduced in 1998 many of German Chancellor Helmut Cole's (pictured) aides had raised concerns . Spiegel dubbed the information in the files as 'Operation Self Deception.' The Germans seemingly knew they were driving the continent into a fiscal cul-de-sac but went ahead with it anyway.On February 3, 1997, the German Finance Ministry noted that in Rome 'important structural cost-saving measures were almost completely omitted, out of consideration for the social consensus.' On April 22, speaker's notes for the chancellor stated that there was 'almost no chance' that 'Italy will fulfill the criteria.' On June 5, the economics department of the Chancellery reported that Italy's growth outlook was 'moderate' and that progress on consolidation was 'overrated.' Horst Koehler, a man who later became German president but at the time was the German chief negotiator in the Maastricht Treaty negotiations, concluded that Italy had not fulfilled the conditions 'for permanent and sustainable deficit and debt reduction,' and that it posed 'a special risk' to the euro. But Kohl overrode him. 'The documents that have now been released suggest that the Kohl administration misled both the public and Germany's Federal Constitutional Court,' said Spiegel. The paperwork comes at a time of rising dissent in Germany among workers that it has become the banker for more profligate nations. Not a convert: Hundreds of pages of German government documents from 1994 to 1998 stated that Italy should not have been allowed to join the common currency . They show Kohl desperately wanted to believe that Italy was 'cleaning up its act' even when his own advisers told him it wasn't. On April 3 1990 the . German embassy in Rome warned that the risk Italy represented to fiscal harmony should 'not be ignored.' Three months later, when Italy had secured its participation in the euro, Italy admitted its bookkeeping was less than exemplary and that reforms planned at Maastricht had not been reached. Spiegel added; 'The message the documents convey is that political opportunism will ultimately prevail. A monetary union amounts to more than shifting several billion euros back and forth. It is also a community of fate. Shared money requires shared policy and, in the end, shared institutions.'The euro is now in its 14th year, and after two years of ongoing crisis, there is a growing realization in Berlin and other capitals that the status quo cannot continue. All reform efforts still resemble small steps to nowhere.'","Documents highlight concerns raised by Helmut Kohl aides before euro was introduced .

"Cyril Smith confessed to spanking teenage boys and engaging in intimidate 'medical examinations' on them but was allowed to remain an MP, former Liberal Party leader Lord Steel has admitted. Rejecting criticism that he had failed to expose sex abuse allegations against 29-stone Smith, who died in 2010, Lord Steel revealed he had confronted the paedophile politician over his 'unusual behavior' at a hostel in Rochdale in the 1970s. In an extraordinary defence of his own - and the Liberal Party’s - conduct concerning the serial sex abuser, the peer again insisted he knew nothing else of Smith’s vile activities. Claims: Ex-Liberal leader David Steel (right) Lord Steel said there 'is no question' Cyril Smith (left) would be 'up for assault now', but argued that at the time corporal punishment 'went on' Lord Steel claimed he confronted Smith . over his behaviour at the Rochdale care home in 1979, after an article . in Private Eye detailed how the Liberal Party MP spanked young boys’ bare bottoms. The magazine had reported on . an investigation published by the Rochdale Alternative Press which . detailed claims made by a number of young men about Smith spanking boys. Lord Steel said he confronted Cyril Smith over his 'unusual behavior' at a hostel in Rochdale . 'I . asked Cyril Smith about it. I was half expecting him to say it was all . wrong and I would have been expecting him to sue to save his reputation. To my surprise he said the report was correct,' The Telegraph quoted him as saying. 'He . had some kind of supervisory role, I don't know what it was, in these . institutions in Rochdale, which he reckoned entitled him to be involved . in corporal punishment,' Lord Steel added. Claiming the Rochdale hostel report was the extent of his knowledge of Smith's abusive behaviour, Lord Steel said: ‘All I knew was what was in Private Eye. Any member of the public could know that.' Lord Steel, who led the Liberals between 1976 and 1988, said . there ‘is no question he would be up for assault now’ but compared the . child abuse claims to corporal punishment in schools. ‘We have to remember that this was a . different era. Corporal punishment was permitted. It would be totally . illegal now, there is no question he would be up for assault now. In . those days it went on', he said. Smith died in 2010 and two years later Greater Manchester Police began investigating claims he abused boys while secretary of Rochdale Hostel for Boys Association in the 1960s. The allegations related to a time in the 1960s when Smith was a Labour councillor and had not yet entered Parliament. Lord Steel insisted that he had ‘no locus’ in the affair. He told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ‘We are a political party, not a detective agency.’ But he said he would not have recommended Smith for a knighthood in 1988 if he had had ‘the slightest inkling’ of allegations that he abused young men while an MP. Allegations: Lord Steel claimed he was only aware of a Private Eye article in 1979 detailing how the 29-stone monster spanked young boys' bare bottoms . Lord Steel said that he found Smith's reported behaviour ‘odd’, but added: ‘The fact is these were allegations that were 10-15 years old. ‘I had no locus in the matter at all. He wasn't even a member of my party at that time.’ Asked if he had considered launching an internal party inquiry, Lord Steel replied: ‘Why should I? There was no allegation about his behaviour as an MP. ‘There are now allegations which have come to light since his death. These were very serious, but they were not known to us at the time.’ Probe: On Monday police announced a fresh probe into an alleged cover-up of Smith's activities in Rochdale . Lord Steel said that the Private Eye report led to ‘gossip and tittle-tattle’ in the Commons about Smith, but insisted that there was no firm allegation about his behaviour as an MP. ‘Idle gossip is not a basis for any inquiry at all,’ he said. ‘Not a single story emerged, not even a rumour emerged about him misbehaving as an MP. If that had happened, of course I would have inquired. ‘If I had had the slightest inkling that that was going on, of course I would have taken action, but these were old allegations, publicly acknowledged, which the police had investigated.’ Lord Steel said it was for the police and not the Liberal Democrats to explain why no action was taken on the initial allegations.","Former Liberal Party leader insists he did not know about sex abuse claims .

"Allegation: Simon Danczuk, Labour MP for Rochdale, said he may unmask someone 'much more important' than Cyril Smith who allegedly abused boys at the notorious Elm Guest House in Barnes, South-West London . The MP who exposed the paedophilia of the late Cyril Smith is threatening to name another former senior politician alleged to have had sex with children. Simon Danczuk, Labour MP for Rochdale, where one of his predecessors was Smith, said he may unmask someone 'much more important' who allegedly abused boys at the notorious Elm Guest House in Barnes, South-West London, which was used as a venue for a paedophile ring of VIPs. 'I have been contacted by people making serious allegations.' The MP says he could use parliamentary privilege - which would give him legal immunity - to name the former influential MP. He added: 'It would be best for him to come forward of his own volition, but I would consider using privilege to name the parliamentarian.' Mr Danczuk spoke as it emerged that disgraced former Co-op Bank chairman Paul Flowers faces questioning over an alleged cover-up of child abuse at Knowl View School, a special school in Rochdale linked to local Liberal MP Smith. Over three decades, boys as young as seven were repeatedly abused at the school by Smith and his cohorts. It was described as 'a sweet shop for paedophiles' and pupils were driven to public toilets to have sex with men who had travelled from all over the North. In 2012 - two years after Smith's death - the Crown Prosecution Service admitted the MP should have been charged with historic child sex offences. At the time of the alleged cover-up, ex-Methodist minister Flowers was vice-chairman of the social services committee at Rochdale Council, which oversaw Knowl View School. He is to face claims that he and other Rochdale councillors ignored a series of damning reports detailing the abuse. This week Flowers, 63, who has been charged with three counts relating to possession of cocaine, ketamine and crystal meth, will receive a letter saying he must answer questions from Andrew Warnock QC, who is leading the investigation into the council's handling of the allegations. Predatory: MP Cyril Smith, left, knew Paul Flowers, right, during their time together on Rochdale Council . Nine others are also part of the investigation. There is no suggestion Flowers, who was also on the council's education committee, was involved in any form of abuse at Knowl View, but his time on the council coincides with key developments in the alleged cover-up. Colin Lambert, leader of Rochdale Council, said: 'The letter is quite strong, and they should be worried because the allegation is that they took part in a cover-up. So if they knew and decided not to do anything that is a very serious matter. 'There are criminal issues here.' Fears that vulnerable young boys were being abused at the school were repeatedly raised between 1988 and 1992, when Flowers held key council posts. Three reports were issued detailing serious sexual abuse at Knowl View, yet no one was ever held to account. It was not until 1994 that the matter was raised again when the reports were discovered by the school's head of care, Martin Digan. Mr Warnock's inquiry will cover the years 1985 to 1995 and will focus on whether there was a cover-up.

"A five-year old boy was raped in the toilets of a prestigious international school in Jakarta International, reports today suggest. It is alleged the boy, who is thought to have turned six last week, was attacked in the toilets of the Jakarta International School by two cleaning staff wearing blue uniforms. The pair twice attacked the boy during school hours in the bathroom nearest to his classroom, reports suggest. Indonesian security officers stand guard in front of the Jakarta International School - where the alleged rape of the boy, then five, is said to have taken place . It is thought the boy contracted herpes and a bacterial infection during the horrific attack. The staff, who are believed to be employees of contract cleaners ISS, are now in police custody following the attacks in February and March - according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Officers in Jakarta have said two other men and one woman are also under investigation. The boy is reportedly the son of a Dutch father and an Indonesian mother. The mother decided to go public with the details of her child's attack after the school was slow to act following the allegations, she says. Reports suggest the boy was attacked by two out-sourced cleaning staff in the bathroom near to his classroom on two occasions in February and March . The family's lawyer Andi Asrun has said the boy's parents believe the school should have been aware of the boy's absence from class -  and his teachers should have noticed he was in distress when he rejoined the class. The lawyer told the newspaper the child was locked inside a janitors' closet during his ordeal so his screams could not be heard. The school's head, Tim Carr, says the school has made security changes and installed CCTV cameras following the horrendous attacks. He added the school was cooperating with the authorities. The school's head has made security changed and installed CCTV cameras following the attacks . In a letter to parents, the school said outsourced staff now had restricted access to the school - and that ISS staff no longer worked on campus. Police have asked parents to monitor their child's behaviour and to report anything suspicious to officers. The Jakarta Education Agency has similarly notified all local schools of the attack and advised them to improve security measures.","Schoolboy, five, allegedly raped by two out-sourced cleaning staff .

"During the 1990s, financial adviser to the stars Dana Giacchetto lived like the punk-rock prince of New York City who by his own admission, 'flew too close to the sun and spun out of control.' His palace was a mammoth SoHo penthouse where he hosted drug-fueled orgies witnessed by a pair of cockatoos named Angel and Tiberius - one each for him and his best-friend, Leonardo DiCaprio. At the height of his rebel-reign, he and the then 23-year-old star of Titanic defiantly watched the 1998 Academy Awards at his Manhattan apartment, while over in  Los Angeles the James Cameron blockbuster won 11 Oscars. Now and then: Dana Giacchetto at the Manhattan Federal Courthouse in February where he is facing fresh fraud charges and (right) at a party in Los Angeles in June 1999 . Best friends: Leonardo DiCaprio enjoys lunch with his one-time pal, Dana Giacchetto in New York in 1998 . 'I was king of the world,' said Giacchetto to The Hollywood Reporter.. 'We projected the Academy Awards on the wall and had every star come to New York to give the middle finger because we felt the Academy Awards were a complete f---ing sellout and anti-punk rock.' His influence on DiCaprio was such, that he reputedly inspired the Hollywood stars' performance in The Wolf of Wall Street, despite their friendship ending when he pleaded guilty to misappropriating nearly $20 million of his clients' money in 2000. Giacchetto, who is now 51, spent three-years in prison for his fraud after swindling millions from clients who included, R.E.M front man Michael Stipe, Spiderman star Tobey Maguire, Cameron Diaz and Ben Affleck. Indeed, he was back in court in February facing charges that he used a friend's credit card to rack up $10,045 in charges to buy liquor, a plane ticket and food, according to court filings. But while he vehemently denies that, in new revealing interview with The Hollywood Reporter, he positively revels in the speculation he was his former friends muse for The Wolf of Wall Street. Party time: Dana Giacchetto with tragic super-agent Jay Moloney (left) and Hollywood financier Tom Lassaly (right) in Los Angeles in 1999 . However, unlike trader Jordan Belfort, whose story is told in the Martin Scorcese hit, Giacchetto tries to claim he is not a fraud - despite his conviction. 'I'm the Lamb of Wall Street,' said Giacchetto to The Hollywood Reporter. 'If I wasn't dragged from an airplane at gunpoint, I would've been able to fix the positions. Whether clients lost money because the market went down or because I was a f—-up, I felt really bad about it. 'I never stole money in my life. Why would I do that to the people that I love?' Inspiration: The muse for DiCaprio's performance in the Martin Scorcese movie The Wolf of Wall Street was allegedly Dana Giacchetto . In 2000, Giacchetto was arrested at Newark Airport, traveling with a fake passport trying to flee the country having admitted fraud involving his incredible list of clients money. Displaying the charisma which no doubt enamored him to talented actors, musicians, directors, artists and Oscar winners, punk-rock fan Giacchetto's big break was brokering the deal for a small underground Seattle record label, Sub Pop, in 1991. On their books was an unknown grunge band named Nirvana, who were tipped for the top. Together with Giacchetto's investment firm, the Cassandra Group, 49-percent of Sub Pop was sold to Warner Music Group in 1994 for $20 million - many times its expected value. By his 37th birthday in 1998, Giacchetto controlled by his estimation, $5 billion in assets - needing to hire a young lawyer called Chris Cuomo, the brother of New York Governor Andrew and current host of CNN's New Day. Armed with success and money, Giacchetto embarked on one huge party - and the celebrity he was indelibly linked to was a young Leonardo DiCaprio. The actor, 12-years Giacchetto's junior, was already on the road to superstardom and spent months living in his friends lavish SoHo apartment. He took him on tours of the New York Stock Exchange and they were frequently spotted at parties together and lunching. Giacchetto told The Hollywood Reporter that he believes he is definitely the inspiration for DiCarpio in The Wolf of Wall Street, although the actor has never mentioned this . Rooftop: Leonardo DiCaprio is seen here in The Wall of Wall Street - more than a decade earlier he was a guest at Giacchetto's penthouse apartment for months at a time . He claims to have been told that when DiCaprio was asked if his old friend was his template, he demurred, 'No, not exactly.' Calling this 'lovely', the convicted fraudster reminisces about the life he led and its similarities to the crazed-lifestyle portrayed in movie. 'I lived it -- not the stealing-money-from-poor-people part. Listen, the sex and the drugs and the decadence in my life was 10 times worse than Wolf, a bacchanalian orgy for 10 years,' said Giacchetto to The Hollywood Reporter. 'There was sex constantly, there were drugs constantly, but there was no sex without condoms ever that I ever witnessed. There were certain rules, and that was one of those rules.' Like a raging Master of the Universe or Wall Street Jay Gatsby, the tales of Giacchetto's parties are legendary. 'There were lots of weird sex scenes,' says one prominent Giacchetto partygoer to The Hollwyood Reporter. 'The loft had $300 champagne, $5,000 hookers, top models, rockers, actors and artists. There also were two cockatoos, Angel and Tiberius -- one each for Giacchetto and DiCaprio. Friends: Michael Stipe of R.E.M. (left) was one of the fraudsters friends as was Ben Affleck (right with his best friend Matt Damon) 'Victoria Leacock Hoffman, a friend of Andy Warhol, Martin Scorsese and Giacchetto, attended a Christmas party at the loft and later threw Molly Ringwald's 30th birthday party there, both of which she says were fairly tame. 'Leo was always sweet and gentlemanly,' she says. Giacchetto's riotous parties also welcomed Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder, Kate Moss, Michael Stipe and Mark Wahlberg - although there are no accounts or suggestions of them partaking in anything nefarious. 'I had all my windows open, and John F. Kennedy Jr. was standing there,' said Giacchetto to The Hollywood Reporter. 'Everyone's like, 'Don't fall out that f---in' window!' His friendship with DiCaprio was so strong that it went beyond money - he claims to have fallen out with the actor's manager over his career trajectory. 'I had a fight with DiCaprio's then-manager Rick Yorn,' said Giacchetto to The Hollywood Reporter. 'He wanted Leonardo to make American Psycho,' as did DiCaprio. 'I called Leo's dad, George, I called Leo's mom, Irmelin. I said, 'Leo, if you do this movie, you must move out. Cutting people up? Is that what you're about?' Former partners: Guests at Giacchetto,'s SoHo parties included Johnny Depp and Kate Moss when they were still a couple . Giacchetto also told The Hollywood Reporte about his controversial relationshps with one time Walt Disney Company chief Mike Ovitz and Hollywood superagent, Jay Maloney, who tragically ended his life in November 1999 after problems with depression. 'My performance for so many years was so good and quantitative -- not bullshit, not boiler room, really good -- that I started to get the Ovitzes of the world and the very, very serious heavy-hitter asset managers to say, 'This guy actually f---ing knows how to trade,' said the fraudster. 'He has a gift. He may be a flake, he may be effeminate, but he knows what he's f---ing doing.' I'm some crazy mathematical rock-star wacko who sold Sub Pop and Matador and made a lot of money.' Despite his convictions, Giacchetto denies he was a thief. His problems began when his previously safe investments began to falter in the late 1990s and instead of telling his famous friends, he attempted to cover up his losses. He began moving money from one account to another, but when he was taken into custody on April 12, 2000, he was carrying only $4,000 in tens and fives. Investments: Dana Giacchetto helped broker the deal that sold Sub Pop - who boasted Nirvana and Kurt Cobain on their books to Warner Music in 1994 and hosted JFK. Jr. to one of his parties too . 'I never planned to steal people's money. I got in over my head on deals that lost money. But I never stole.' His friendships with the rich and famous ended - or they did officially according to Giacchetto. 'When I go to Hollywood and see all my old clients, which I do, it's always off the record,' he said to The Hollywood Reporter. 'Even the people that I loved the most, they would answer the phone like, 'I'm afraid to see you,' because Hollywood is so small. Leo, I mean, we only talked through lawyers through the years because we're afraid.' Despite his impending credit card fraud, Giacchetto says that he has found happiness as the father of two children, although their mother has left him. He is friends with heiress and fashionista Daphne Guinness and plays in Manhattan with his band, Element 4. Indeed, his entrepreneurial skills are still strong. He owns a food business called Taste which makes salsa. However, he will always remember the heady days of the late 1990s as witnessed by his 2001 sentencing, when he told the judge, 'I lived in a world of fantasy.'

Staff at Arizona's Banner Desert Medical Center initially thought baby Richie's face was swollen at birth. But they were stunned to discover the reason his eyelids would not open was because he did not have eyes - an extremely rare condition called Anophthalmia. Scroll down for video . Staff at Arizona's Banner Desert Medical Center initially thought baby Richie's face was just swollen . But they were stunned when they discovered the reason his eyelids weren't open is because he had no eyes . Richie's mother Kelly Lopez, who had a normal pregnancy, became worried after Richie failed to open his eyes after he was born. A MRI scan 13 days later showed that he had been born without eyes. She told KTLA that it was a traumatic discovery and 'by the time we left, I think every single nurse had cried with us.' But she and her husband, who are from Mesa, Arizona, are optimistic that science will progress enough to help Richie, who does have an optic nerve, see in his lifetime. The three-month-old had surgery to be fitted with expanders in his sockets, so that they will grow enough to hold a prosthetic eyeball in the future. The three-month-old had been fitted with expanders to allow his sockets to grow, but he rubbed them out . However, at present the baby only has one expander in place. Both expanders fell out after Richie rubbed his eyes and Mrs Lopez was only able to replace one. She described her husband's encouragement as he held their son while she struggled to insert the expander, adding: 'I got it in and then I just cried'. Mrs Lopez said: 'I do hold out hope. I know that researchers are testing it and doing what they can, but I do hope that, one day, they'll be able to grow an eye or transplant an eye.' But for now, the couple are helping their son with special toys and development programs. His mother Kelly revealed how she struggled to put one back in and added she is hopeful he will one day see . Anophthalmia is a medical term that means an absence of the eye - and a child may be born with one, or both eyes, missing from the eye socket. The terms Anophthalmia and Microphthalmia (small eyes) are often used interchangeably since CT scans or MRI show some remnants of either the globe or surrounding tissue in most cases. The condition is extremely rare and a report from a prospective study of 50,000 newborns found an incidence of microphthalmia of 0.22 per 1,000 live births. In a recent study in England, the prevalence of Anophthalmia and Microphthalmia was one per 10,000 births. It is not known exactly what makes Anophthalmia occur, but it is likely due to a disruption in the sequence of developmental steps that take place when the eye is forming during pregnancy. They may result from inherited genetic mutations, sporadic genetic mutations, chromosome abnormalities, prenatal environmental insult or other unknown factors. Unfortunately, there is no treatment that will restore vision in children affected by Anophthalmia and they need to undergo repeated hospital visits. Many have prosthetic eyes to ensure that the bone and soft tissue around the eye socket grows properly and to improve appearance.

Australia’s national day was ruined by grey skies and rain across some parts of the country including Toowoomba in Queensland . 'Goon of fortune': These true blue Aussies spun a sack of goon on their clothes line for a bit of fun . Explaining the drinking game on photo sharing site Imgur, one commenter wrote: ‘Strap a goon (wine) sack onto the spinning clothes line. Spin. Whoever it lands on sculls from the sack for a predetermined amount of time.’ One fan of the photo added: ‘I also like how during the drinking game you also have a beer while you're waiting for your turn.’ On a dusty bush track, a puddle shaped like the Australian flag was allegedly spotted on Australia Day. A Woolworths store was caught out when the hung a New Zealand flag from the ceiling on Australia Day . These four lads were visited by the police after their roadside drinking game turned sour . The friends said it was an 'overreaction' when up to ten police officers came and spoke to them . While, West Toowoomba Bowls Club in Queensland jokingly cancelled the day due to the rain and grey skies, calling it ‘Pommie weather’. One shopper questioned a navy tank top they found which had ‘Made In Straya’ adorned on it in white writing. Inside the singlet the shopper supposedly found a label which read ‘made in China’. Another Aussie found a plastic drink’s tumbler adorned with the Australian flag which was also ‘Made in China’.

"The two men behind the Iraq invasion that led to today’s crisis were busy enjoying themselves yesterday. Tony Blair and George W Bush showed little concern over the execution of Mr Foley and the continuing carnage in Gaza. Mr Blair, now the Special Envoy to the Middle East, was pictured over the weekend on his summer holiday in shorts, flip-flops and sunglasses. Scroll down for video . Former Prime Minister Tony Blair with his wife Cherie, and restaurant owners Emanuele and Sarah Tomasello in Sicily . And yesterday George Bush issued an ill-timed video of him taking part in the latest video craze called the Ice Bucket Challenge, where a bucket of water is poured over his head. Mr Blair is currently enjoying ‘la dolce vita’ on Lipari, the largest of the Aeolian islands off the north coast of Sicily. He and wife Cherie were staying there as guests of wealthy industrialist Massimo Carello and his wife Sara, who have a luxurious villa on the island. The Blairs were seen out and about dining on prawns and seafood platters at several of Lipari’s best restaurants, and on a yacht belonging to one of Mr Carello’s friends. It is thought the Blairs left Lipari on Tuesday, but it is not clear where they were heading. Mr Blair is officially the Special Envoy for the Middle East on behalf of the Quartet - the United Nations, European Union, United States and Russia - with a brief to help broker peace between the Israelis and Palestinians. But his role might be expected to see him take a wider interest in the region. The last post on his official website was on July 31 when he welcomed the (as it turned out, short-lived) Gaza ceasefire and said he hoped it would secure ‘a broad, sustainable and long-term solution to the crisis’. Together . with former George W. Bush, Mr Blair has faced criticism for his . handling of the Iraq war while Prime Minister and the toppling of Iraqi . dictator Saddam Hussein without carefully laying the foundations for a . post-Saddam regime. Yesterday, . hours after the video of US journalist James Foley being beheaded by an . Islamic State militant was put on the internet, Mr Bush posted a video . of himself clowning around and having a bucket of water poured over his . head on his own Facebook page. He . was taking part in the so-called ice bucket challenge, which has caught . on with notable figures participating in the campaign to raise money . for the fight against ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease, a progressive . neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the . spinal cord. The former president's wife Laura Bush pours water over him before he nominates his predecessor Bill Clinton . The stunt was poorly timed - it was released just hours after video showing journalist James Foley being beheaded was publicly released . In the video, Mr Bush nominates Bill Clinton, his predecessor as U.S. president, to take the challenge next. Mr Bush said: ‘To you all who challenged me, I do not think it’s presidential for me to be splashed with ice water, so I’m simply going to write you a check’, before his wife Laura Bush comes into shot, douses him and says: ‘That check is from me - I didn’t want to ruin my hairstyle.’ Former Fiat executive Mr Carello previously provided hospitality to the Blairs in 2006 when Mrs Blair stayed at his mansion on a hill overlooking Turin while she attended events as an ambassador for the London 2012 Olympics. Mrs Carello is a trustee of the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women. Mr Blair infamously enjoyed a free holiday in Sardinia at the 27-bedroom villa of since-disgraced Italian premier and billionaire Silvio Berlusconi in 2004. That jolly was much remarked on at the time - both because Labour MPs were appalled at their leader accepting hospitality from such a sleazy Right-wing host, and the fact Berlusconi sported a ridiculous bandana during their public appearances, to conceal the aftermath of a hair transplant. In August last year, while there was a crisis in Syria after claims of a chemical weapons attack in Damascus, Mr Blair was to be found in Sardinia again, this time on a superyacht owned by American music mogul David Geffen, and then in St Tropez, the perennial playground of the international playboy. Yesterday a spokesman for Mr Blair declined to discuss what he was doing in Lipari.","Two men behind the Iraq invasion show little concern over current crisis .

"The 'gutted' woman at the centre of a blackmail scandal has come out to defend her name after her former fiancé threatened to reveal graphic details of an alleged affair with England cricketer Eoin Morgan unless he was paid £35,000 ($70,000). Brooke Tsakirakis's ex-partner, Nick Emery, said he would release 'sexually-based' messages and videos he found on his computer featuring the cricketer, 28, unless he was paid the money before the start of England's match today. Now, a tearful Ms Tsakirakis said she is 'furious' that her life has been ruined because of a relationship she had five years ago and claims Emery unlawfully gained the information from her phone. Scroll down for video . England cricket captain Eoin Morgan, pictured with his current girlfriend Tara Ridgway, was the focus of a £35,000 blackmail plot over a fling with an Australian woman five years ago . The emails were traced to safety consultant Nick Emery (above). He is pictured with Brooke Tsakirakis - who said she is 'gutted' and her life has been ruined because of a relationship she had five years ago . 'I don’t want to air mine and Nick’s dirty laundry, but I’m gutted. I’m ropeable angry. I’m fur­ious, but I don’t think right now that anger towards him is worth wasting my energy on because I have to protect my children. They are my first priority,' the 36-year-old told The Mercury. Ms Tsakirakis made it very clear that she is not in a relationship with Emery any more and he is well aware of the situation. Mr Emery, a safety consultant from Tasmania, said he had come across 'some interesting Skype calls' between his fiancée  and Morgan after Tsakirakis had backed up her phone on his computer. He told reporters: 'I have got a fair bit of interesting content regarding Eoin Morgan with a woman who isn't his girlfriend ... there's sexual content. It's my partner.' However, a 'furious' Ms Tsakirakis said Mr Emery hacked into a deactivated Facebook account she had at the time she met Mr Morgan. '[At] no time [was] my phone uploaded or backed up on his computer. He unlawfully gained that information and he has admitted that to me,' she said. Ms Tsakirakis went on to say that she was is more concerned about the effects the scandal is having on her two children aged 13 and eight. 'I’m a true and honest person and I’ve always supported Nick through our relationship and tried to help him.' she said. The England Cricket Board said it had received an email, demanding money be paid or details of Morgan's previous relationship, including videos, would be given to both the UK and Australian press . She said the controversial messages between her and Mr Morgan 'may have been romantic or sexually explicit' but claimed that they were not out of the ordinary for two consenting adults. Ms Tsakirakis was astounded when two Cricket Australia officials visited the gym she works in to ask her questions about the blackmail scandal. She initially thought they were there to join the gym but soon realised they were looking for Emery. 'I was quietly embarrassed. They were quite supportive but they said they didn't want it to go any further and they had a deadline, the situation needed to be dealt with and they needed to talk to Nick and where was Nick?' she said. In one interview with the Australian press, Emery claimed he had found compromising messages between the pair from just last year. Speaking to the Melbourne-based Herald Sun newspaper, a distraught Ms Tsakirakis, 36, said: 'My life is ruined because of a relationship I had five years ago.' The Tasmanian mother-of-two said she had no knowledge of Mr Emery's alleged blackmail attempt. 'He's the one who tried to extort money, not me,' she said. 'I'm gutted.' A collage of happy photographs of Mr Emery and Miss Tsakirakis, which he posted on social media . Ms Tsakirakis said she has now ended her relationship with her fiancé and the cricketer said his involvement in the blackmail plot has not distracted him from the job at hand. The England captain, who has been dating Australian model and law student Tara Ridgway for the last three years, is understood to have had a relationship with Ms Tsakirakis five years ago while he was playing cricket in Australia. On Wednesday, the England and Wales Cricket Board took the extraordinary step of releasing details of the plot amid fears that speculation surrounding the dalliance could disrupt the match. The board also disputed Emery's claim that there was some kind of relationship between the pair last year, insisting that the relationship took place five years ago when both parties were single. The blackmail plot emerged before Dublin-born Morgan led out his side against Australia. The ECB immediately told Scotland Yard of the blackmail plot after receiving two emails from Mr Emery. UK detectives then tracked him down within 24 hours with the help of colleagues in Australia. After meeting ECB officials and Australian police officers, he said he had made a mistake because he was in a 'bad head space'. Emery's fiancée is Brooke Tsakirakis. She has spoken out following the blackmail plot and said she is 'gutted' Speaking to the Herald Sun, he said: 'It's done. It's dealt with. I did the wrong thing in the wrong state of mind. 'I wanted to catch her out in a big way. I was in a very angry and bad head space. 'Everything is sorted now. They were very understanding. We came to an agreement.' He said he had stumbled upon the messages when his partner backed up her phone on his computer. Emery added: 'It was a stupid mistake on her behalf. I knew something went on between them a long time ago.' He said he had called Morgan's number to confirm it was the cricketer, but had not confronted either of them. The blackmailer gave no indication to his friends or family about what he was planning to do. Instead, he posted a picture of himself and Ms Tsakirakis smiling on his Facebook page last week. The cricketer, 28, is currently in a relationship with Ms Ridgway (left), who is studying law and public relations at Bond University in Australia . Morgan is thought to have met his girlfriend during the 2010/11 Ashes series in Australia, which England went on to win 3-1 . Morgan and Ms Ridgway pictured together in Australia earlier this month . In October he wrote: 'This time one year ago I met this hottie for a coffee. 12 months on we still meet for coffee, every morning in the kitchen. She keeps me real, she believes in me and I love her loads.' A month later he announced their engagement over Facebook. On Wednesday, Paul Downton, managing director of the ECB, said: 'There were references to a relationship that Eoin Morgan had five years ago with a single Australian lady. 'It was a brief relationship and what appears to be a fairly deliberate attempt to extort a sum of money from the ECB. 'The individual, who comes from Hobart, demanded that the money be paid before the first ball was played on Friday. 'The suspect has been identified as an Australian resident of Hobart who is the new boyfriend of the woman Morgan dated five years ago. 'The individual is understood to have found a phone with details of Morgan's relationship. 'He has now apologised saying it was not intended to go this far.' Mr Downton said the ECB would not be pressing charges against Mr Emery. Police declined to comment. Morgan (centre) today with his teammates James Taylor and Tim Bresnan. The ECB has said it will 'not allow anyone to disrupt our team's performance on the field of play' Morgan insists his involvement in the blackmail plot has not distracted him from the job at hand, despite being dismissed first ball in the Tri-Series defeat to Australia. 'It hasn't been distracting at all. I spoke with the ECB yesterday and I was very happy for them to deal with it,' he said. 'They told me just to focus on the cricket 100 per cent and I've done that. 'I was very comfortable with them looking after the situation. 'I'm happy it's all been cleared and everything is over and I can get on with my cricket, which I managed to do today.'

Speaking ahead of the trip to home side's 8,000-capacity home Van Gaal explained that he preferred using a 3-5-2 system because a more traditional 4-4-2 left his side open. 'All the matches when we play 4-4-2, like against West Ham United, it was always twitching your ass and I don’t like it,' he said.

The next day, the 26-year-old all rounder was left out of the Pakistan team, who lost to a New Zealand President XI. According to Pakistan team manager Naveed Akrama Cheema, Mr Sohail was 'visibly shaken' after the incident and called a member of the coaching staff.
