"By . Joel Christie . A Michigan high school student who was banned from competing in his school track meet unless he got rid of the pink Mohawk that honors his cancer-stricken mother has decided to quit the team rather than give in to regulations. Mike Barker, a junior at West Iron County High School in Iron River, told FoxNews he was told his new hair style did not meet the school's grooming and appearance policy. He was told by his coach and then the school principal that he could not compete in his team's meet on Thursday unless he changed his haircut to something more conservative. '[My coach] told me I can't have pink hair with Mohawk to support my mom with breast cancer,' the 17-year-old told FoxNews. Banned: West Iron County High School student and track athlete Mike Barker wanted to show his support for his mother's fight against breast cancer by dyeing his mohawk-style hair bright pink . Barker said he was told to shave his head or return it to its natural state (pictured) otherwise he would not be permitted to compete . Honored: Wendy Pawlicki, 37, who has battled breast cancer three times, said she is outraged that the school only had a problem with her son's hair once he dyed it pink . 'I want this to change. That's my goal' Barker said the idea began when he and his mom were talking at the start of football season in the fall. 'She said, 'You know what you should do for me? You should dye your hair pink and make a Mohawk for me',' Barker said. By the time basketball season came around, his hair was long enough for a Mohawk and finally on Wednesday he bleached his hair to prepare for dying it pink. His mother, Wendy Pawlicki, said she was all the more outraged because her son had been to track practice for weeks with his Mohawk, but it was only when he dyed it pink that he was suddenly not allowed to compete. West Iron County High School principal Mike Berutti released a statement about the incident, reiterating their regulations, which Barker confirmed he was aware of before he chose the hairstyle. 'The West Iron County Public Schools supports the needs of the students to express themselves, as long as their expression does not interfere with the educational process,' the statement said. 'We also strive to balance individualism of athletes with the concept of team that fit within our athletic code. Mike Barker was banned from track meet at West Iron County High School in Iron River, Michigan (pictured) because of a pink Mohawk he got to support his cancer-stricken mom . 'The athletic department is going to work with the student and parents to resolve this issue. 'The student was not dismissed from the team and we welcome his participation in the future. 'The athletic department has long supported breast cancer awareness by participating in numerous events involving student athletes and staff held in October (Breast Cancer Awareness Month) and plan to continue to support this worthy cause.' But Barker says it was,in fact, his principal, in addition to his track coach, who said it was shave his head or not compete in the track meet. Pawlicki said several family members have had cancer and she was proud of her son's commitment to raise awareness with his pink Mohawk. Following the controversy, a group of students arrived at the track meet with similarly-styled pink Mohawks. Barker, along with the other students who fashioned their hair after him, were not allowed to compete. Even students from other schools are joining in on the trend, Pawlicki said. 'I'll support him in whatever he's doing,' she said. Barker and his supporters have been circulating a support . petition which he hopes to turn into the school board. He says he does . not regret his decision, and is going to try for track again next . year, again with a Mohawk.","Mike Barker's mother, Wendy Pawlicki, 37, has battled breast cancer three times .

"By . Paul Donnelley . The grandfather of Alexandria Hollinghurst, the British teenager who with Brandon Goode, her American boyfriend, killed a policeman, blames himself for the tragedy. David Hollinghurst also dismisses suggestions that his granddaughter had drug problems or mental illness. ‘She’s a spoilt brat,’ he said. ‘She hadn’t got her own way, so she did whatever she did.’ 'Spoilt brat and it's all my fault': Alexandria Hollinghurst, 17, just wanted her own way says her grandfather who blames himself for moving the family to America . David Hollinghurst, the grandfather of  Alex Hollinghurst on his front porch at his home in Okeechobee Florida . Blames himself: David Hollinghurst,  the grandfather of  Alex Hollinghurst, believes that he is at fault for the tragedy that befell her . The home in Okeechobee Florida of David Hollinghurst, the grandfather of  Alexandria . Mr Hollinghurst emigrated to America in 1995 with his wife Lynett. Their son, Tom, his wife Jane and their two daughters followed 12 years later. They moved into a bungalow in one of the new neighbourhoods on the edge of Disney World. He blames himself for the tragedy. ‘I’m the one that came here,’ he said. ‘It sucks, this place, it’s horrible. I’m angry at myself for coming here.’ Another ex-pat Brit, a property developer from Oldham in his 50s, told The Times: ‘A lot of Brits live here. Like Disney World, it’s a fine place for children and adults of a certain age, but it can be a hard place to keep a teenager. Alexandria Hollinghurst had an uneasy relationship with her mother but adored her father (left); Officer Robert German was on duty last Saturday when he encountered Hollinghurst and her boyfriend Brandon Goode. They murdered him before committing suicide . Officer German's body is taken away by paramedics after he was gunned down by two teenagers . Brandon Goode (left) and girlfriend Alexandria Hollinghurst were making their way to his father's house when they were stopped by Officer Robert German. They murdered him and then committed suicide . ‘There is a void there,’ he said. ‘One of my son’s friends just hanged himself. Florida is a pill mill.’ Alexandria Hollinghurst was bright – she completed school a year early – but frustrated in the confines of her home and had a rocky relationship with her mother. In a letter she wrote to 18-year-old Goode, after the pair was arrested on drugs charges, she revealed that she hoped she would go to prison. ‘I need a break from the bitch.’ She had met Goode in 2012 and saw a new life with him. They would drive to Kissimmee to buy marijuana. On a trip back in February this year the police stopped the car and found drug paraphernalia inside. Goode was sent to jail and Hollinghurst to a juvenile assessment centre. They wrote to each other several times, hatching more and more unlikely plans including one that involved stealing a boat and sailing to Panama. Both sets of parents wanted the couple apart. On March 19, the day before he was due in court, Goode delivered a letter to Hollinghurst’s home. 'Brat': Alexandria Hollinghurst moved to America in 2007, following her grandfather, David, who emigrated in 1995. He later regretted the move and blamed himself for the tragedy that befell his granddaughter . She climbed out of her bedroom window, leaving a rude letter for her mother. ‘Thank you for accusing me of being anorexic FOR YEARS,’ she wrote. ‘After trying to fix things, thank you for turning a conversation about depression and suicide into something all about you.’ Ironically, neither Goode nor Hollinghurst were going to see the inside of a prison – he was to be sent to a rehabilitation unit and no further action was to be taken against her. By that time, it was too late and the two teenagers were on the run. Officer Robert German was tasked with intercepting the couple as they made their way to Goode’s father’s house in Windermere, an affluent area. He caught up with them around 4am last Saturday. Three shots rang out – Officer German was murdered. Five minutes later, the two teenagers were also dead.","David Hollinghurst moved to America in 1995 followed 12 years later by son and daughter-in-law and two granddaughters .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Attack: Jeanne Marie Ryan, 29, suffered a broken nose and fractured cheek bone after being attacked in a club when she confronted a man who tried to grope her . An Oxford University student who posted a battered and bruised 'selfie' after a nightclub attack to make a stand against violence has raised more than £12,000. Jeanne Marie Ryan posted the graphic photo of her purple and blue, swollen face online after being beaten in a nightclub. The 29-year-old said she confronted a man who groped her on the dancefloor and was punched in the face up to seven times. She suffered a broken nose and fractured cheek bone. As the 'no make-up selfie' mania began to sweep social media to raise money for Cancer Research UK, the student decided to make her own stand. And in just one week, she has surpassed her £100 target, raising more than £12,000 for a rape crisis centre in Oxford from over 1,400 donations - and the amount has been rising every minute. The DPhil student, reading Education at St Edmund Hall, said: 'I was really, really mad. I thought I just needed to do something about this. 'I wanted to help women who go through this sort of thing. I get very angry with guys like this. 'I'm just incredibly impressed. It has just made me feel a lot better that something good can come out of this. I wasn't expecting this at all.' On her Just Giving page, she added: 'I am sorry cancer research, but my #nomakeupselfie is for a different cause. 'I'm trying to channel my rage into something constructive, so I'm raising money for the Oxford Sexual Abuse and Rape Crisis Centre.' Women around the world posted images online of them without make-up in support of Cancer Research . Viral: Miss Ryan's attacked selfie emerged as no make-up selfies swept social media last week, with celebrities such as Cheryl Cole joining in and making donations to the charity . Recalling the attack she said she was groped by a man as she danced at Plush Lounge in Park End Street, Oxford. The attacker then reigned down seven blows leaving her bloodied and bruised. 'He was expecting me to back down and cry and when I didn't, he just got more and more angry,' said Miss Ryan recalling the attack. The student was then punched outside the club, causing her to trip down some steps. A variation on the trend saw men taking pictures of themselves wearing make-up . 'I was hoping that someone would pull him off me. But when I stood back up, he hit me another four or five times,' she said. A spokesman from Oxford Sexual Abuse and Rape Crisis Centre said they work with more than 350 women and girls, and their families, each year who have been sexually assaulted. 'We're overwhelmed by the response to the campaign and would like to give huge thanks to Jeanne Marie for sharing her experience in such a brave way,' said the spokesman.

"By . William Turvill . The friend of Prince Harry who organised his Kazakhstan skiing holiday with Cressida Bonas has denied suggestions it was a PR stunt. Inge Solheim, a Norwegian former stockbroker, has described allegations that the four-day trip was a ploy to gain publicity for a country with a poor human rights record as ‘nonsense’. He said his 'dear friend' Harry, 29, decided to go on the holiday on the spur of the moment and insisted suggestions to the contrary were ‘inaccurate, speculative and disappointing’. Inge Solheim (right) has denied suggestions Prince Harry's skiing holiday to Kazakhstan was a PR stunt . The royal couple: Cressida Bonas and Harry in Kazakhstan, with his police protection officer behind them . Mr Solheim, 41, said the couple’s decision to go on the trip was ‘wholly innocent’. He told the Telegraph: ‘Harry is a dear friend and if I can facilitate a visit during which he and Cressie can spend some time in private, as young lovers want to, it’s beautiful.’ Mr Solheim, who met Prince Harry on a 2011 expedition to the North Pole, flew with the couple and his wife, Anna, on the private jet of Turkish-born property developer Burak Oymen. My Oymen, 40, who now lives in Monaco but has homes across the world, is understood to have sent his private plane to London to collect the four. This photograph shows Burak Oymen with his Czech model girlfriend, Tereza Maxova . The son of a senior Turkish . politician, he and his business partner, Serzhan Zhumashoc, who has . close links with the controversial Kazakh ruler, President Nazarbayev, . own the ski resort of Shymbulak where Harry stayed. He recently said in an interview it was his intention to turn the resort into the ‘Courcheval of Kazakhstan’. Amnesty International has questioned the Prince’s decision to visit Kazakhstan, a country accused to serious human rights violations. Mr Solheim told the paper that while he had been planning the trip for some time, Harry’s involvement was a late arrangement. He said Mr Oymen, a ‘very dear and close friend’, is already a very well-connected man and ‘so he isn’t trying to gain something from this'. Anna Solheim, the wife of polar adventurer Inge Solheim, who organised the weekend . He told the paper: ‘The only reason Harry and Cressie came along was that I said I was going to Kazakhstan to chill out, and said to Harry, “Do you want to come along?” ‘Harry said that, yes, it would be a great way to chill for a short time. That’s all it was. I don’t care what anybody thinks. That was it.’ He defended Harry against allegations his visit was an endorsement of the Kazakhstan regime, although he added: ‘I don’t believe you are going to bring Kazakhstan up in the world by isolating its people.’ On suggestions the trip was a PR stunt, he said: ‘We managed to keep the visit secret for one and a half weeks but, of course, we were under no illusion that we could keep it secret for ever.’","Inge Solheim described allegations the four-day trip was a ploy to gain publicity for a country with a poor human rights record as 'nonsense'

"By . Scarlett Russell . A successful marriage can be achieved in six steps over 21 days, say a married therapist couple. In Making Happy: The Art and Science of a Happy Marriage, Dr . Les and Leslie Parrott claim trying new hobbies, doing something . charitable together and writing 'gratitude letters' to those that have . supported their relationship are just some of the steps that can . transform your marriage from 'good' to 'great.' Implementing these steps over the course of three weeks promises to give a 25per cent happiness boost to any flailing relationship, say the Seattle-based couple. Happy marriage: A new book promises to save your relationship in just 21 days, by following a 'six point happiness plan' Dr Les Parrott is a clinical psychologist and his wife of 29 years,  Dr. Leslie Parrott, is a marriage and family therapist. 'A . lot of couples sail along and do fine, they don’t want to rock the . boat, but they’re missing out on the next level of commitment,' Dr Les tells MailOnline. ‘One of the biggest complaints we hear is that the couple's ""spark"" has gone, but by making little changes and creating new habits, you can kick the boredom and monotony out of your marriage and be much happier. 'And we know from psychological research that it takes three weeks to form a new habit.' One of the book's 'Happiness Boosters' is, ‘Count your blessings,’ meaning couples must tell each other precisely what they are grateful for. ‘This will instantly increases your level of happiness,’ says Dr Parrott. 'By . making little changes and creating new habits, you can kick the boredom and . monotony out of your marriage' ‘Gratitude puts things in perspective. You can’t help but become more satisfied with what you have in your own life.’ The book also suggests couples write a letter to someone other than their own spouse, who . has been a significant part of their relationship - perhaps a parent they model their marriage on or a friend who gives brilliant advice. But instead of sending them the letter, the doctors advise that couples read it to them aloud. Not only will this make the recipient feel incredible, but it’s a reminder of the strength of a couple’s relationship, explains the doctors. And while date nights are all well and good, going to the same old restaurant every Friday night simply won’t do. Secrets of a happy marriage: Authors Drs Les and Leslie Parrott are both relationship therapists. They have been married for nearly 30 years and a couple for 37 years, as they started dating in High School . The book instructs couples to try brand new activities together to recreate the chemistry of when they first fell in love. ‘This has been proven to change the chemistry in your brain,’ says Dr Parrott. ‘You can’t help but come away feeling more energized and excited.’ Another 'Happiness Booster' is ‘Celebrating each other,’ where the book encourages couples to give more attention and conversation time to positive things that happened to their partner that day. 'Celebrating . positive things together greatly strengthens your . relationship' ‘This shows that you’re supporting each other,’ says Dr Parrott. 'It's not about just taking an interest in your spouse but celebrating . positive things together, which we’ve found greatly strengthens . relationships. You should be each others biggest cheerleaders.’ Discussing the future is another vital step: ‘The moment a couple stops looking toward future, they are defeated,’ says Dr Parrott. ‘You have to be able to see where you are headed because, not only is it exciting to have a plan and something to look forward to, but also it certifies your commitment to one another.' He suggests that a couple talks about what they want to have accomplished together in five years and where they want to be in ten years, like a business plan but for marriage. For . the more spiritual couples out there, in the ‘Attune Your Spirits’ chapter, couples are encouraged to pray or meditate together, which the . authors are convinced will also bring partners closer. Happily ever after: New book Making Happy, pictured here, promises to improve your marriage . Not so New Age-inclined? ‘Feel free to skip this step in that case,’ laughs Dr Parrott. Finally, though the ‘Happiness Boosters’ do not need to be completed in any particular order, the book advises couples to ‘add value to others,' essentially asking them to look beyond their own marriage to those less fortune and help them together. This . could mean sponsoring a child (something the Parrotts have done and . say it strengthened their relationship) or taking part in a charitable . event or activity. ‘This is a big step and the effect is immediate,’ says Dr Parrott. ‘When a couple reaches out beyond boundaries of their own married life, it adds value to their life and becomes fulfilling.’ Once . the book defines and explains each of these steps it draws out the . 21-day plan, suggesting how a couple can implement certain elements of each . 'Booster' to their marriage that day. ‘The plan works because couples become conscious of activities they can do together which will bring them closer and make them more grateful,’ says Dr Parrott. ‘It doesn’t require a major overhaul or a lot of hard work; it’s just about paying a little bit more attention to detail and making a little more effort in specific ways.' The biggest message of this book, says Dr Parrott, is that marriage doesn’t make people happy, it is people that make their marriage happy. ‘Our research says that when you rely on your marriage as a ""happy pill,"" you can elevate your mood for two years but, after that, the honeymoon period has worn off and you have to work at it,’ he says. ‘Any marriage in any stage can benefit: One that is doing badly will do better and one that is good will become great.' Drs Les and Leslie Parrott have written several books, including Saving Your Marriage Before It Starts, which has sold over a million copies. Their books, The Hour That Matters the Most and You're Stronger Than You Think were both number one on the New York Times Bestsellers List. In 1991, they founded the Center for Relationship Development on the campus of Seattle Pacific University – a program dedicated to teaching the basics of good relationships. They have been together for 37 years after meeting in Junior High School and married seven years later. They live in Seattle with their two sons and, in June, will celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary. Making Happy: The Art and Science of a Happy Marriage is published  April 15, Worthy Publishing.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Missing: Inez Garcia was last seen leaving a Santa Fe bar in November 1952 . Bones found under the dirt floor of a New Mexico garage could finally solve the case of a mother-of-four who went missing in 1952. Inez Garcia was last seen leaving a Santa Fe bar in the early hours of November 6 after having an argument with her husband, who later reported her missing. Detectives decided to revisit the unsolved 62-year-old case earlier this month and, on Tuesday, found two bone fragments that could belong to the 27-year-old woman. Family and friends of Ms Garcia had always feared the worst, saying she would never have walked out on her four children, aged from eight months to five years at the time. Rumors circulated for decades that her husband, who has since died, may have been involved. Police told Fox News that after Ms Garcia disappeared her husband, Juan Andres Jose Garcia, refused to let anyone in the garage. 'Nobody was allowed in here when he was . alive ... The kids weren’t allowed in here, nobody . was ever allowed in here, so it’s just the mystery of what could be . here,' police spokeswoman Celina Westervelt said. 'There were lots of rumors that he buried her in the dirt floor,' she added. Mr Garcia, who was 40 at the time of his wife's disappearance, was questioned several times by police but never charged. Two officers have been searching the dirt floor by hand, and brought in a cadaver dog too which is said to have immediately pinpointed areas of interest. The fragments of bone they found are thought to be human, and could be from a shin bone and forearm. Cold case: Detectives decided to search the garage after talking to old colleagues about Inez Garcia . Search: Detectives sift through the dirt floor of the Garcias' old garage . The bones have been sent to a laboratory that will test whether they are human. DNA samples were also taken from one of Ms Garcia's daughters to see if it will match. It is not the first time the garage of Ms Garcia's home has been dug up in the search for her. When the apartment changed hands in 1996, after her husband's death, police were called in after reports that neighborhood dogs were hanging around the garage, according to the Albuquerque Journal. In that case two large bones were found, but tests showed they were from animals. Detective Garcia, who is not related to the family, decided to open the cold case after speaking to older colleagues in the police department. 'I thought, ""Why not?"" Maybe I could bring a little closure,' Detective Garcia told Santa Fe Mexican. It will take about two months for tests to be completed on the bones.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Oprah Winfrey's ex-stepmother could be evicted from the $1.4 million Nashville home the talk show host bought for her to live in. A court hearing scheduled to take place on Monday could bring an end to a legal case that has hung over the Winfrey family since her father Vernon filed for divorce from Barbara in 2012. Barbara Winfrey, who was married to Oprah's father for more than 20 years, has appealed for the TV star to call her so they can talk 'woman to woman'. Dispute: Barbara and Vernon Winfrey pictured in 2010. The couple divorced in 2012 . The 66-year-old says she will have nowhere to go if evicted from the house she has lived in for 13 years, and says she will be left with a bad credit rating that will prevent her renting a new home. 'I'm not trying to stay here [just] to . stay here,' Barbara Winfrey told the Tennessean. 'Where am I going to go at 66 to . find someplace to live? Who's going to rent to me?' After her husband filed for divorce, claiming inappropriate marital conduct, Barbara Winfrey made claims that Vernon has been abusive to her. In a messy legal dispute, Barbara claimed Vernon cheated on her . for years with prostitutes including one named 'One Tooth', and . threatened to shoot her. She also claimed a woman tried to blackmail him over a sordid sex tape. The judge ruling stated that the TV . talk show star purchased the property after . her father gifted it to another man, Tom Walker, who then defaulted on . the mortgage. 'The court . finds [Vernon Winfrey] allowed [the marital property] to go into . foreclosure knowing that it would be purchased by his daughter, Oprah, . for his and Thomas Walker's benefit and to defeat any interest of . Barbara Winfrey,' the ruling stated. At the time of the hearing, a spokesman for Oprah told Radar she stepped in because she didn't want her father's 'life work to be dissolved.' 'The . property was in foreclosure and when it went up for auction, Ms. Winfrey bid and got it because she didn't want her father's life work to . be dissolved,' the spokesman said. Court date: Barbara Winfrey faces an eviction hearing on Monday over this $1.4 million home . Legal proceedings: A spokeswoman for Oprah, pictured here with her father Vernon, says the TV star offered Barbara several deals including a different property to live in . A source close to the family said at . the time Oprah had been stunned by her step-mother's allegations. 'The . idea that her father would conduct himself this way is very disturbing . to Oprah,' the source said. In . court papers seen by the New York Post, Vernon admitted having a . one-week affair with an unnamed woman, but said he apologized when his . wife found out. He and Barbara, a school teacher, married in 2000 and lived in the property she now faces being evicted from. As . part of the divorce deal, Barbara Winfrey was offered a different . property, in Chateau Valley, Nashville, for free but she chose not to . accept it. The deal to move there allegedly included having to sign a confidentiality agreement about Oprah but Barbara Winfrey said: 'I'm not going to sign anything.' Family: Oprah with her father, Vernon, at an awards dinner in 1994 . Protective: Oprah is said to have been stunned by the allegations her stepmother made against Vernon, a Nashville barber . A spokeswoman for Oprah said an offer was also put to the star's ex-stepmother to sell the house she is in and split the proceeds equally. But she turned that offer down too. 'After several requests to voluntarily vacate the property at . Willowbrooke Circle, the appropriate paperwork has been filed to have . her vacate the property,' the spokeswoman told the Tennessean. Barbara Winfrey claimed that she had never been offered money from the sale of the house, but said it was an offer she would now accept. She added that she wasn't trying to take anything from Oprah. 'It's not money. It's never been about money. If it had been about money, I would have taken it and run a long time ago.'","Barbara Winfrey says she turned down offers of help because she didn't want to sign a confidentiality agreement .

"By . Snejana Farberov . A 63-year-old Wisconsin man is in a coma after falling off a roller coaster due to a faulty safety bar three weeks ago. An attorney for the family of 63-year-old Anthony Theisen said the man remains at University Hospital in Madison with numerous fractures and a brain injury caused by the March 6 accident. According to Lake Delton police, Mr Theisen fell nearly 17 feet from the Opa! Twister Steel Roller Coaster to the concrete floor at Mt. Olympus Theme Park in Wisconsin Dells. Bad ride: Anthony Theisen (right) and his wife, Kay, were enjoying a day at Mt Olympus Theme Park in Wisconsin Dells March 6 when the 63-year-old man fell from a roller coaster . Indoor attraction: Mr Theisen plummeted 17 feet from the Opa! Twister coaster . Unrestrained: An investigation revealed that Mr Theisen's lap bar became loose while the four-person cart he was on was rounding a corner . Theisen's wife, Kay Theisen, was riding in the same cart and told police her husband's lap bar unlocked when they went around a corner, hurling him into the air. Attorney Todd Korb said Theisen sustained a fractured scapula, four fractured vertebrae, fractured toes, a fractured finger and dislocated shoulder, in addition to life-threatening brain injuries. Officer Troy Spencer wrote in his police report that he checked the four lap bars in Theisen's cart several times and found three bars could not be pulled up. But, the fourth bar, where Thiesen was sitting, came unlocked. ‘It appeared that the lap bar on Seat #1 locking mechanism was stripped. I checked the lap bars over three times to make sure Seat #1 was the only seat to come unlocked, which it was,’ Spencer wrote. Police interviewed several witnesses at Mt. Olympus, including a maintenance worker who told investigators the ride was working properly during test runs that day. Pain and suffering: Mr Theisen (left) sustained a life-threatening brain injury, a fractured scapula, four fractured vertebrae, fractured toes, a fractured finger and dislocated shoulder . Theisen's attorney said a safety test was done on the ride earlier this week. Sand bags to simulate Theisen's weight were placed in the seat he was using, Korb said, and when the cart reached the point on the track where Theisen was ejected, the lap bar opened. The couple who were riding with the Theisen couple in the four-person cart said they saw the man ‘flying out of the cart’ and hurtling through the air ‘like a rag doll,’ Wisconsin Dells Events reported. Another amusement park visitor told police she rode in Theisen’s very seat five minutes earlier and noticed the safety bar was slack, according to the report cited by Channel 3000, forcing her to hold onto it for the entire duration of the ride. Anthony and Kay Theisen live in Fremont, and according to the woman’s Facebook page, they have three grandchildren. Tourist destination: Mt Olympus officials said it is the first time an accident of this type has occurred at the Wisconsin theme park . Playground: Mt Olympus Water and Theme Park, which has been in operation since 2004, features a total of 53 rides, including seven roller coasters . Mt. Olympus said in a statement released by general manager Adam Makowski that the company has fully cooperated with Lake Delton Police and the Wisconsin Department of Safety and Professional Services (DSPS). It is the first time an accident of this type has occurred at the theme park, the statement said. The roller coaster will remain closed pending the results of an investigation.

Steven Fields, of Hull, turned himself in Friday. He faces a charge of theft by taking. The Madison County Sheriff's Department says a teller at a bank in Hull mistakenly deposited a check for approximately $31,000 into the wrong account. Behind bars: Steven Fields, 18, turned himself in after failing to return $25,000 that a bank had accidentally deposited into his account . Big spender: Police say Mr Fields went on a wild shopping spree, making purchases at a car dealership and various stores . According to investigators, Mr Fields wasted no time going on a massive shopping spree, with stops at a car dealership, a variety of stores and a fast-food restaurant. Authorities say there was an effort to come to an agreement between Fields and the bank, and that Fields eventually said he couldn't repay the money. The 18-year-old, who graduated from high school last year, has an account with the Athens branch of First Citizens Bank. On March 7, he received an unexpected windfall totaling $31,000 after a bank employee unwittingly processed the deposit into the wrong account, police told the Athens Banner-Herald, because multiple customers have the same name. Bank employees discovered the error March 17 and immediately found the missing money’s destination. By that time, about $25,000 of the deposit was already gone, police said. Fields, from nearby Hull, had withdrawn $20,000 in cash and made $5,000 in purchases with his debit card, authorities said. More money, more problems: Fields received an unexpected windfall totaling $31,000 after a First citizens Bank employee processed the deposit into the wrong account . He was confronted by bank employees about the missing money when he arrived at the bank the following bank and attempted to withdraw more cash. Fields was asked to return the missing funds but refused, claiming that it was an inheritance from his grandmother's estate. The teenager eventually agreed to come to an agreement with the bank, which gave him a deadline of March 19 to return the missing $25,000, but Fields was unable to come up with the funds in time. Nearly four years ago, then 14-year-old Fields wrote prophetically on his Facebook page: 'Life is like a coin. you can spend it in any way you wish, but you only spend it once.'","Steven Fields, 18, turned himself in Friday after failing to return the money .

"By . Snejana Farberov . A 10-year-old California girl's personal plea to Pope Francis has been answered when her detained father, who is facing deportation, was released Friday. Mario Vargas was freed from a detention facility in Louisiana after he posted $5,000 bond. A relative who saw his daughter, Jersey Vargas, on television asking the pontiff for a miracle during a public audience helped with the funding, said his wife, Lola Vargas. 'When she left, her wish was that her father would be home,' she told The Associated Press in Spanish. 'Thank God she is going to get her wish.' Ask, and you shall receive: Just days after Pope Francis met with 10-year-old . Jersey Vargas (pictured), who pleaded with him to help spare her father from deportation, the child was reunited with her parent . Tears of joy: Jersey (center) cries as she gives interviews after greeting her father Mario Vargas-Lopez (second right) as her brother Yancy Vargas, 8, (center left) looks on at Los Angeles airport, California March 29, 2014 . Reunited: Mario Vargas-Lopez was freed on bond from a detention center in Louisiana three days after his daughter asked Pope Francis for help in stopping her father's deportation . Mr Vargas' release came after his daughter, of Panorama City, Calif., addressed the pope this week as part of a California delegation that traveled to urge the Vatican to prod President Barack Obama on immigration reform. The girl and a teenager went as part of the 16-member group to represent the American children of immigrant parents who are afraid their families will be divided by deportation. The president and the pontiff met for the first time Thursday. 'I feel very happy and proud because I'm finally going to have my dad back and we're going to be reunited,' Jersey told the AP late Friday before boarding a flight from Rome to Los Angeles. She said her father was also heading to Los Angeles, and that she hoped he would get there before her arrival Saturday. Together at last: Jersey said she has not seen her father in two years, and that the separation was hard on their family . DUI rap: Mario Vargas was arrested last year in Tennessee and convicted of driving under the influence . 'I haven't seen him in two years,' she said. 'It's been very hard since my dad hasn't been home. My mom has had to be the provider for my family, she's been the mother and father for two years.' Mario Vargas was arrested in Tennessee in September on a drunk driving charge and served a six month sentence. Upon his release he was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and held in a Louisiana detention facility until he could appear before a judge for removal proceedings, said Bryan Cox, agency spokesman in New Orleans. A judge had approved the bond request several days before the girl met with the pope, but the money was not available until late this week, said Vargas' attorney, Alex Galvez. The bond amount was not changed as the result of his daughter asking the pope to intercede, Cox said. Vargas-Lopez is required to stay in communication with ICE and tell agency officials where he is pending his next court appearance, Cox said. Emotional: The 10-year-old burst into tears when she came face to face with the pope, telling him that her father was suffering . No special treatment: ICC officials said t Vargas' bond amount was not changed as the result of his daughter asking the pope to intercede . 'Him being released on bond in no way translates into special action on his behalf,' Cox said. 'This was standard procedure.' Galvez agreed that the release was unrelated to the daughter's visit with the pope. He said her message to the Catholic leader was related to the larger need to improve an immigration system in the United States that separates families. Lola Vargas said she had been gathering money to pay for her Mexican husband's bond but didn't have enough until one of his cousins called, surprised to see the girl on TV, and offered to help. Her husband had gone to Tennessee to look for work in construction and had been sending money to his family in California, she said. Juan Jose Gutierrez, an immigrant advocate who coordinated the trip to Italy, said the archdiocese of Los Angeles helped get the group a key spot so they could speak with Pope Francis amid the crowds. Little Jersey, a chatty and outgoing fourth-grader from Panorama City, arrived in the Vatican Wednesday as part of a delegation from Southern California that traveled to Rome to deliver 1,300 letters to the pope written by children of undocumented immigrants. The advocates were hoping to have a few minutes to speak to the pontiff, but the slender little girl was the only one out of her group to squeeze her way to the front of the crowd. When she finally came face to face with Pope Francis, the 10-year-old burst into tears, telling the leader of the world’s 1.1billion Catholics, ‘My Father is suffering.’ Pontiff's promise: Pope Francis gave Jersey a blessing and promised her to speak to President Obama about U.S. parents facing deportation when he meets him Thursday (pictured) She also gifted the pope with a handkerchief embroided by her mother with the words 'nido de amor,' which means ‘nest of love’ in Spanish. 'That napkin represented my family – my mom and dad – until they got separated. Their nido was destroyed,' the girl revealed to OC Register. In return, the Holy Father gave Jersey a blessing and a kiss on the forehead. 'I told him to pray for my family and to ask the president to stop deportation because it's separating my family,' Vargas told Fox News Latino. Jersey, who is a U.S. citizen, said the pontiff then whispered in her ear that he was going to discuss the deportation issue with Mr Obama.","Jersey Vargas, 10, traveled to Vatican City in 16-person delegation of American children whose immigrant parents are facing deportation .

McDonald's hopes that the limited promotion will catapult breakfast sales to stay on top of their competitors . The Oak Brook, Ill., company is hoping that the coffee giveaway will bring in new customers. It's also a way to get existing customers to come in more frequently. And it's likely that those stopping by for a free coffee will be tempted to pick up a breakfast sandwich or other items while there. Breakfast is an important component of McDonald's business, comprising about 20 percent of its U.S. sales. The announcement comes as Taco Bell rolls out ads to promote its new breakfast menu, which includes a waffle taco. The ads star everyday men that happen to be named Ronald McDonald, the same name as McDonald's mascot. Chains like McDonald's Corp., Taco Bell and Starbucks Corp. - which recently revamped its sandwiches - are all fighting for a piece of the breakfast market because people are increasingly buying breakfast on the go.

For a long time McDonald's, which started offering breakfast nationally in 1975 with the roll out of the Egg McMuffin, has dominated the morning category.

"By . William Turvill . John Garner, 53, died after being found with serious head and leg injuries surrounded by debris, oil and thick smoke off the coast of St Vincent on Wednesday . The diving instructor who was first to the scene of a British sailor’s yacht after it caught fire in the Caribbean does not believe he was murdered. John Garner, 53, was found with serious head and leg injuries surrounded by debris, oil and thick smoke off the coast of St Vincent on Wednesday. He was pronounced dead upon arrival at hospital on Wednesday afternoon. A murder investigation is underway and police have said they are hoping to speak to the Briton’s wife, Heidi Hukkelass. But Kay Wilson, a professional diver from Bristol who has lived in the Caribbean for 12 years, does not believe he was murdered. Ms Wilson said: ‘My initial impression was that it was an accident. There is the fact that it had happened around lunchtime and there was an explosion on board. ‘The injuries this person had was, from my perspective, that something had exploded in his face and he had injuries to his face and leg. ‘I did not see any defensive wounds or anything that would suggest that there was foul play.’ Mr Garner flew to St Vincent with his wife on January 19. But ex-pats living on the island - including Ms Wilson - said Miss Hukkelaas left her partner two days previously, to return to Norway to look after her children, as planned. And despite Caribbean police claiming to be searching for Miss Hukkelaas, Norwegian authorities said no requests have been made with them regarding her whereabouts, only to inform Norwegian relatives that Mr Garner had died. 'We have not been asked to do anything but inform relatives of the incident,’ a spokesperson for Norwegian Police told Verdens Gang. ‘We are not aware that the Norwegian woman is wanted internationally and there is no such request regarding this woman in our system.’ St Vincent police commissioner Michael . Charles said: ‘We are treating the death as suspicious and are looking . at all lines of inquiry. We suspect foul play and will investigate the . matter fully. ‘Miss . Hukkelaas is a person of interest and as with every murder investigation . we have to look at everyone and everything and will leave no stones . unturned.’ Officers said checks revealed Miss Hukkelaas had not left the country via any of the island’s main airports or seaports. The commissioner refused to confirm her nationality or relationship to the deceased last night. However, Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang . has been in touch with the Miss Hukkelaas' family and they have confirmed . that she is back in her home country, arriving the day before the . incident. Diving instructor Kay Wilson (pictured here on Skype) has said she believes Mr Garner's death was an accident . A local TV station posted this picture believed to be of the yacht on fire off the coast of St Vincent . Ms Wilson, who owns Indigo . Watersports, said she was taking a boat trip full of guests from a . nearby hotel resort when she saw smoke on the horizon and went to . investigate. She said . she and her crew discovered Mr Garner's body free floating in the water . wearing a life jacket, with severe lacerations to his face and legs. A burning life raft was also found close to the yacht, which was well ablaze, she said. His . passport and personal documents were floating nearby in a waterproof . 'grab bag' - a tool commonly used by yachtsman in case of emergency. Only his personal details were found in the bag, indicating that he was alone, she said. She said: 'There was a lot of debris in the water, as there commonly is with explosions. 'He . was free floating in the water. A life raft was nearby but it didn't . appear to have deployed properly and that was on fire too. 'The heat from the burning vessel was such that we could feel it when we were approaching.' She . said: 'It was lunchtime, I think he may have gone to the galley to make . himself something to eat and the lacerations on his face and legs lead . me to believe he was bending over a gas canister. 'If someone had killed him onboard, he wouldn't have been able to try and deploy his life raft. 'I have been living in Caribbean for long time and have helped rescue people in severe floods. 'When . you attend you expect to help people. If you do encounter someone that . you are unable to help, one thing that makes it more tolerable, was at . least we were able to uncover Mr Garner's body for his family. ' Police say the life raft was found approximately 15 nautical miles west of Buccament in southwestern St. Vincent . Mr Garner's yacht, Asante, was found floating about 15 nautical miles off the coast of St. Vincent . Mr Garner's daughter Elisabeth, 37, . told the MailOnline on Thursday that her family were unaware that her . father's death was being treated as suspicious, and was instead a . 'tragic accident'. She . said she had spoken to her stepmother who had left St Vincent two days . before Mr Garner, to head back to Norway and look after her young . children. She said: 'She always leaves before him. 'This . is a shock for everybody. We have not been told that this is being . treated as suspicious. As far as we have been told, it is being treated . as a tragic accident.' A . sailing friend in Norway, where Mr Garner has lived for many years, said . the divorced grandfather was ultra-fit and previously worked as a . physical trainer for British special forces. He had previously divorced from a Norwegian woman and had several children and grandchildren, the source said. The . friend said on Thursday: ‘It is very shocking news. He was a very nice . man. He loved his yacht, Asante, and he was meticulous about the way he . kept it. He had a military attitude towards things and was a strict . sailing instructor. ‘He . is what you would call an English gentleman. He trained the special . forces in Britain, the SAS I believe, although he was a civilian and did . not have a rank. ‘He . loved sailing and I know Heidi went with him sometimes, although I never . met her. He was often in the Caribbean and would then come back to . Norway, where he had a house.’ The friend said they had previously spoken to Mr Garner about the dangers of travelling to St Vincent. ‘Me . and John spoke about St Vincent many times. In the yachting society, St . Vincent is somewhere you sailed straight past and did not stop at. ‘It was not a safe place, it was a place to avoid. People were worried about thefts and robberies and rapes. ‘Boat . boys would try to help you to anchor, when you did not need help, and . then charge you money. You paid them because you feared they would come . back at night time. ‘I told John this but he would say that it was okay and that he did not have a problem with them.' On Wednesday, pictures emerged of the burning boat, with plumes of black smoke billowing out. The yacht, called Asante, was found floating about 15 nautical miles off the beautiful coastal resort of Buccament, south-west of the island, which boasts several five-star hotels. The Asante was is described as 'a large ocean-going yacht of 49 feet and very pretty' with four sleeping cabins . A file picture of the Asante. Mr  Garner's body was found on board a partly burnt raft at sea on Wednesday . Police said Mr Garner and Miss Hukkelaas had recently been granted permission to extend their stay on the island until April 19. Mr Garner had previously advertised sailing trips around the British Virgin Islands for between £5,500 and £9,000. The . online advertisement offers a journey around a ‘beautiful area’ and . lessons in navigation, boat handling and overboard practice, among other . kills. It states: ‘The instructor of Asante, John Edward Garner is Norwegian / English and he is also the owner of the boat. ‘Skipper . and instructor John at Asante is a graduate of the English Yachtmaster . system and Yachtmaster Ocean from England, and has sailed far.’ The boat is described as ‘a large ocean-going yacht of 49 feet and very pretty’ with four sleeping cabins. The course was described as suitable for beginners and adheres to ‘British Royal Yachting Association’s rules’. The . murder comes just two months after retired management consultant Roger . Pratt, 62, was murdered and his wife Margaret, 60, injured when robbers . attacked their yacht as it lay moored off the Caribbean island of St . Lucia. The couple, from .

"By . Wills Robinson . For decades they led the way in childrens' entertainment and were a constant fixture at birthday parties. But the future of British clowns is now in serious doubt, and it is no laughing matter. The entertainers claim an increasingly 'cynical' public image has seen membership at Clowns International (CI) drop from almost 1,000 in the 1980s to just 100. They also argue TV characters such as The . Simpsons' Krusty the Clown, who is portrayed as a heavy smoker and . drinker, and filmmakers who turn friendly clowns into psychopaths, have contributed to the decline which could see the . profession wiped out. Conference cancelled: Clowns gather for the annual gathering in Butlins at the beginning of March in 2007. This year's event did not go ahead after the company withdrew its sponsorship . The clown in horror film It, based on the Stephen King novel, and . the Joker, played by Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight, have created an increasingly sinister view of the entertainers, with children relating to them as villains rather than loveable comedians. The average age of clowns has also risen, . with fewer younger people wanting to take up the profession, and many . have had to go part time as work at childrens' parties has dried up. Former chairman of CI, Blue Brattle, told The Daily Telegraph: 'There is an image problem. There is a very negative view from Hollywood, with films like It and characters like Krusty. He added it was no longer 'cool' for children to have clowns at a party, as parents are opting for television or film-themed events instead. 'Now its all DJs and paintball themed-parties.It's the way of the world, children and growing up quicker. Cynical: A veteran entertainer has said clowns on TV, like The Simpson's degenerate, Krusty, have created a negative public image . 'For some reason, clowning has been jumped upon as being unfashionable and the scary clown bandwagon has been particularly jumped upon. This year's annual gathering of clowns at Butlins in Bognor regis was cancelled this year after the holiday camp withdrew its sponsorship. Attendees usually provide free entertainment to holidaymakers in exchange for free accommodation and food, but falling numbers have signaled the end of the deal. Children having a phobia of clowns may also be blamed on the decline, but the 70-year-old veteran entertainer claims he has only met one person who had a genuine fear. The problem is not confined to Britain with the World Clown Association reporting that membership has fallen from about 3,500 to 2,000 in the past decade. The Joker, from the Batman films, is believed to have made coulrophobia more prevalent . Scientists generally agree that . coulrophobia is a result of not knowing who lies behind the makeup, red . nose and hair of a clown. According . to Coulrophobia Facts, research has shown the fear of clowns has . increased since the Steven Spielberg's 1990s' film, 'It', which depicts a . murderous clown. The portrayal of the Joker in Batman films is also blamed. According . to the site, the phobia, which can cause panic, breathing difficulty . and nausea, does prevent some people from eating at McDonalds. Coulrophobia can affect both adults and children.","Membership of Clowns International (CI) has fallen from 1,000 in the 1980s .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . Cuban villagers staged a mock funeral and burial of a living man this week in a boozy festival that has become an annual tradition in a small town near Havana. A tractor pulled a trailer slowly through the streets in the early morning carrying the man in a coffin and a four-piece tropical band. Behind it, dozens of people drank, clapped and sashayed to the music, as a white-haired woman pretending to be the bereaved widow wept loudly for the 'deceased'. 'What a good man he was,' Carmen Zamora cried, dabbing at her eyes with a handkerchief. 'He's leaving me all alone. I don't want them to bury him in the ground. My God, no.' Mock funeral: Divaldo Aguiar, who plays the part of Pachencho, is lowered into a grave as he lies inside a mock coffin as part of the Burial of Pachencho celebration at a cemetery in Santiago de las Vegas, Cuba . Hurting: Carmen Zamora, who plays the part of Pachencho's widow, grieves over her husband's 'dead body' Old tradition: Men carry Pachencho's dead body in a coffin through a cemetery in Santiago de Las Vegas, Cuba, for the mock funeral . The celebration in Santiago de las Vegas, about 12 miles south of the Cuban capital, has been held each February 5 for the last 30 years and is known as the Burial of Pachencho. But the atmosphere is more street-party than funereal. 'I never miss this party. I tell my boss and take a day off work,' said 50-year-old Rebeca Morera, shaking her hips to the music. 'This is a tradition of my town where I was born and raised. We can't lose it.' 'Being reborn is the most beautiful thing there is in life': Mourners play instruments and toss flowers during the mock funeral which is more street-party than funereal . Party time: Carlos Pineiro plays two trumpets during the annual Burial of Pachencho in Santiago de Las Vegas, Cuba . Annual tradition: A tractor pulls a trailer slowly through the streets to the cemetery in the early morning carrying Aguiar in a coffin, along with a four-piece tropical band and the white-haired woman pretending to be the bereaved widow weeping loudly for the 'deceased' The bash kicked off Wednesday with a slow procession to the local cemetery. Pallbearers carried the coffin of 'Pachencho', who's known the other 364 days of the year as Divaldo Aguiar, to an open grave and used ropes to lower it six feet under. A man masquerading as a priest in a flowing blue frock made the sign of the cross over the grave and muttered, 'rest in peace'. People blew trumpets, banged drums and tossed flowers. Then villagers splashed rum into Aguiar's mouth from above, and he opened his eyes and climbed out of the tomb. 'Being reborn is the most beautiful thing there is in life,' said Aguiar, who said he has played 'Pachencho' for several years running. Bonding: The celebration, about 12 miles south of the Cuban capital, has been held each February 5 for the last 30 years, with an atmosphere that is more street-party than funeral . Outburst: It's not clear if this little girl is crying for 'Pachencho' or her mother as she sits in the back of a tractor pulling a mock coffin . The tradition was born on February 5, 1984, when villagers got the idea of putting on a mock burial to mark the end of local carnival season. It took its name from the title of a play that had been shown in what was then the town theater. 'Pachencho' is not representative of any real person, living or dead, explained Alvaro Hernandez, head of a learning and recreation center that today is housed in the former theater. 'He's a product of popular imagination,' Hernandez said. 'It's an homage to the challenge of life': The annual tradition was born on February 5, 1984, when villagers got the idea of putting on a mock burial to mark the end of local carnival season . Dead drunk: Pallbearers lighten the load with a lick of rum under the Cuban sun . Even the dead get thirsty, apparently: Playing dead is thirsty work, with mourners pouring rum into Divaldo Aguiar's open mouth . Following Aguiar's miraculous revival, the procession returned to the center and the party went on all day long. 'This breathes life into a town that needs it because life is hard here,' said Yaumara Solis, a 39-year-old homemaker. 'Mourning a live dead man is not disrespectful to the dead - it's an homage to the challenge of life.' Well played: Carmen Zamora, who plays the part of Pachecho's widow, sits under a framed picture of Cuba's President Raul Castro as she waits for the start of the annual celebration .","Santiago de las Vegas villagers staged mock funeral, known as 'Burial of Pachencho', on February 5 .

Birkenstock picked up the 3,424-square-foot, 30th-floor pad at 40 Broad Street in 2011 for $5.86 million, then engaged in a $5 million renovation spearheaded by Miami-based interior designer Steve Harivel, the force behind nearby Soho House. Lined with exposed brick, 1920s Art Deco doors from a Hawaiian theater and hardwood floors from the Portuguese embassy in Paris, the pad is now on the market for $12.99 million. Platinum Properties' Daniel Hedaya and Khashy Eyn have the listing, according to The Real Deal. Luxury: The two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment is perched above The Setai wellness center in Manhattan's Flatiron District. It has been listed for $12,995,000 . Shielded behind an LLC, Birkenstock bought the 30th-floor, 3,424-square foot apartment in 2011 for $5,867,156 .

"By . Deni Kirkova . and Heidi Parker . Cosy nights in eating pizza and pasta and generally pigging-out tend to go hand in hand with being a loved-up couple. And Jennifer Aniston claims she's just like the rest of us who gain a bit of 'love-chub' when we're happily dating. The smitten Friends star, 45, she says she's been suffering the typical symptom of being comfortable in a relationship and indulging in carb-heavy treats with her other half. And it's all thanks to boyfriend Justin's killer Carbonara. Loved-up celebrity couple Justin Theroux and Jennifer Aniston pictured at the Oscars last year . In an interview with People magazine, girl next door Jennifer said: 'Like, hello! Carbonara. It's a killer. The last couple of years since meeting this man have made me gain a couple extra pounds. But it's all worth it.' Ok, so the weight gain isn't very obvious to us - perhaps because Jennifer hasn't slacked at the gym. She said she sticks to daily Yoga sessions and plenty of cardio workouts. 'It catches up to you, and you take care of it,' Aniston says. 'But it's still fun. It was all in the name of love!' Rather than allowing pounds to creep on and panic close to summer, Jennifer says she exercises all year round, reported Grazia. 'It's not about bikini season,' she said. 'It's about being healthy. Of course we want to have toned skin and legs and muscles and all that, but it's really just about feeling great.' Jennifer looking slightly curvier on 14 September 2013 (left) and super svelte back in June  (right) It's been nearly two years since Justin Theroux, 42, popped the question to Jennifer. UsWeekly has claimed the lovebirds - who met in 2011 on the set of Wanderlust - may want to tie the knot without all the fanfare. 'Jen and Justin might be eloping!' the publication reported last week. The weekly added that the actress is looking to move fast. 'She would love for the big day to be this spring,' added the insider. Jennifer has been married only once before, to Brad Pitt; this will be Justin's first time getting hitched. 'She already had the big fairytale wedding,' a longtime friend reportedly told UsWeekly. 'Now she's ready for something 'not too stuffy, something casual' with her closest friends.' A destination wedding is a possibility. 'Jen would fly people out, someplace warm. Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, is a possibility. She loves it there.' Jennifer has said: 'We already feel married,' but that hasn't kept her from thinking about her wedding day appearance. In July she told Marie Claire: 'For my wedding, I wouldn't do an updo, but I think a veil is always pretty.'","Jennifer, 45, says Justin's signature Italian dish is 'killer'

"By . Associated Press . Nearly a million jars of peanut butter are being dumped at a New Mexico landfill to expedite the sale of a bankrupt peanut-processing plant that was at the heart of a 2012 salmonella outbreak and nationwide recall. Bankruptcy trustee Clarke Coll said he had no other choice after Costco Wholesale refused to take shipment of the Sunland Inc. product and declined requests to let it be donated to food banks or repackaged or sold to brokers who provide food to institutions like prisons. 'We considered all options,' Coll said. 'They didn't agree.' Wasted: Some of the millions of jars of 'perfectly safe' peanut butter are dumped at a New Mexico landfill after Costco insisted it was destroyed . Dumped: Almost a million jars of peanut butter are being trucked to a New Mexico landfill after Costco refused to either accept them or allow them to be donated to food banks . Costco officials did not return telephone calls seeking comment. But court filings indicate the product was made with $2.8 million worth of Valencia peanuts owned by Costco and had been sitting in the warehouse since the company shut down and filed for bankruptcy last fall. After extensive testing, Costco agreed to a court order authorizing the trustee to sell it the peanut butter. But after getting eight loads, Costco rejected it as 'not merchantable' because of leaky peanut oil. Coll said 'all parties agreed there's nothing wrong with the peanut butter from a health and safety issue,' but court records show that on a March 19 conference call Costco said 'it would not agree to any disposition ... other than destruction.' So instead of selling or donating the peanut butter, with a value estimated at $2.6 million, the estate is paying about $60,000 to haul the 950,000 jars of nut butter — or about 25 tons — to the Curry County landfill in Clovis, where public works director Clint Bunch says it 'will go in with our regular waste and covered with dirt.' Refusal: Costco refused to take the shipment and declined requests to let it be donated to food banks, repackaged or sold to brokers who provide food products to institutions like prisons - even though tests showed it was safe . Closed: Bankruptcy trustee Clarke Coll said the peanut butter was produced for Costco Wholesale before the plant shut last autumn . The last of 58 truckloads was expected Friday, he said. Sunland made peanut butter under a number of different labels for retailers like Costco, Kroger and Trader Joe's, along with products under its own name. But the plant was shut down in September 2012 after its products were linked to 41 salmonella cases in 20 states. It later reopened for about five months, but shut down last October after the company's Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing. Sunland processed Valencia peanuts, a sweet variety of peanut that is unique to the region and preferred for natural butters because it is flavorful without additives. Sonya Warwick, spokeswoman for New Mexico's largest food bank, declined to comment directly on the situation, but she noted that rescued food accounted for 74 percent of what Roadrunner Food Bank distributed across New Mexico last year. 'Our fleet picks up rescued food from hundreds of locations weekly and brings it back to the food bank,' she said. 'Before distributing it, volunteers help label, sort or repack it for distribution to partner agencies across the state. 'Access to rescued food allows us to provide a more well-rounded and balanced meal to New Mexicans experiencing hunger.'","$2.6 million worth of peanut butter is being taken to the dump .

"By . Brendan Carlin . The Tory MP who lied about his role in a Nazi-themed stag party was forced to resign after David Cameron intervened, it was disclosed last night. Aidan Burley was summoned to a Downing Street showdown after The Mail on Sunday revealed he had failed to tell the truth to an official Tory Party inquiry into the matter. The Cannock Chase MP insisted he had not lied and made it clear he wanted to hang on to his seat. Nazi party: Aidan Burley, centre, was filmed at a meal which included toasts to the third Reich, alongside Mark Fournier, pictured right in an SS uniform . But, after further discussions involving Mr Cameron’s senior officials, it was decided he should step down at the next General Election. ‘There were just too many inconsistencies in his story,’ said one insider. Eventually, Mr Burley decided to throw in the towel and stand down. It is now more than two years since this paper uncovered Mr Burley’s  role in a Nazi-themed stag do in the French alpine resort of Val Thorens. Footage showed the MP at the event which featured a toast to the Third Reich and the bridegroom Mark Fournier dressed as an SS officer in a uniform brought by Mr Burley, his best man. 'Difficult time': Aidan Burley and his fiancee Jodie Jones with the Prime Minister at No 10 . Mr Burley was shortly afterwards sacked as a ministerial aide after admitting ‘clearly inappropriate behaviour’ but further action was put on hold pending a full inquiry and the outcome of court proceedings in France which forbids the wearing of Nazi uniforms and insignia. Mr Fournier was last month convicted for using the uniform. Conviction: Mark Fournier, pictured in Nazi uniform, was fined by a French court . But the publication shortly afterwards . of the Tories’ own report into the event sparked a new storm after this . newspaper showed Mr Burley had lied to the inquiry by claiming he had . not been present at a bar where revellers were chanting ‘Hitler’ and . ‘Himmler’. A Mail on Sunday photograph provided incontrovertible proof that he had been at the bar. Separately, a tape recording made at the pub, with Nazi chants audible in the background, revealed a member of Mr Burley’s party identifying him as MP for Cannock Chase. The inquiry also reported Mr Burley had claimed he had left the earlier stag dinner ‘immediately after’ the groom’s brother gave an offensive toast to the Third Reich, giving the impression he had walked out. But, at best, that account was highly misleading as the entire party left the Restaurant La Fondue at that stage, as video footage taken by this paper clearly shows. No one from the inquiry, conducted by Tory peer Lord Gold, asked for this paper’s version of the events. In his resignation statement last week, Mr Burley said: ‘After a difficult time, I have decided to announce I will stand down at the next General Election.’ Damning: How the Mail on Sunday covered the scandal . But insiders said the party’s need to hold Mr Burley’s Cannock Chase seat was a key factor in his standing down.One said: ‘There was a view we’d have a much better chance of defending the seat next year with a new candidate.’ Senior figures in the Jewish community praised The Mail on Sunday’s reporting of the scandal. Rabbi Aaron Goldstein, senior rabbi of Northwood and Pinner Liberal Synagogue, said: ‘The glorification of Nazi culture and all that it represents is never acceptable. This behaviour is not consistent with holding public office.’ A Tory spokesman insisted the decision to quit had been the MP’s alone. Reaction: Aidan Burley's response on Twitter to our story last week - and one user's reply . Tory chairman Grant Shapps last night insisted his party had treated the Aidan Burley affair with the ‘utmost seriousness’. But he still did not answer a series of questions put to him by The Mail on Sunday. They are: . In a statement last night, the Tory chairman said: ‘The Mail on Sunday exposed an incident that the Conservative Party has treated with the utmost seriousness.’ He added that Lord Gold ‘took the view that all serious and substantive allegations relating to Mr Burley would have been put in the public domain by The Mail on Sunday or other newspapers. On this basis, he reached his conclusions’. Mr Shapps said that while this paper had highlighted a ‘conflict around the factual account of the precise events of the evening’, that did not impact on the report’s conclusion. He said: ‘It remains the case that  it is right that your exposure of the incident ended with Mr Burley  losing his job, apologising, and visiting Auschwitz but that equally, Mr Burley was not driven by racism or anti-semitism.’","Aidan Burley was filmed by the Mail on Sunday at a Nazi-themed stag party .

"By . Matt Lawton . Now read Dominic King's full match report from Anfield HERE . However much Brendan Rodgers and Roberto Martinez might have in common, and however close their two teams might have been in terms of points prior to this encounter, here was a Merseyside derby that highlighted the gulf that still remains. It is a gulf in quality and resources on the pitch. A gulf that means Liverpool can boast one of the finest front lines in Europe, all bought and paid for thank you very much, while Everton are still picking up bargains in the loan market. Take nothing away from Brendan Rodgers and his players here at Anfield. They were magnificent; a superb attacking force that demonstrated to devastating effect that, of the two teams in residence either side of Stanley Park, they are the better equipped to challenge for a Champions League place this season. Perhaps even the title. Scroll down for video . Pass masters: Brendan Rodgers (left) and Roberto Martinez (right) watch as their sides battle out the Mersey derby . Head to head: Brendan Rodgers (right) welcomes Roberto Martinez to Anfield as Everton manager . Down to business: Martinez (right) and Rodgers (left) were vocal on the touchline . But while Rodgers watched Luis Suarez . and Daniel Sturridge once again combine to destroy another Premier . League defence, Martinez had to try and respond with his attack all but . neutralised by the loss of Romelu Lukaku to what looked like a nasty . ankle injury. That Martinez . had to turn to Steven Naismith as a replacement really said as much as . the fact that Lukaku remains a 20-year-old on loan from Chelsea. Rather . than throw money at Suarez, Everton’s supporters might have been better . served donating it to their club. Lukaku’s . premature departure does not explain how Everton proved so ineffective . in containing Liverpool’s forwards when they came here to Anfield having . lost only twice in the Premier League this season. But . a team lacking any real punch at one end will always suffer at the . other and so it was for an Everton side left crushed by their rampant . rivals. Off to a flyer: Liverpool surged into a 3-0 lead at the break over Everton at Anfield . There were other . issues for Martinez. As well as the absence of Sylvain Distin and Seamus . Coleman in his back four, it was clear that Phil Jagielka, Ross Barkley . and Steven Pienaar were lacking fitness after their recent injury . problems. But this remained . an uncharacteristic performance from Everton and one that Martinez will . not be prepared to accept whatever obstacles they had to overcome. He . expects his team to be organised and disciplined. Not in total disarray. Gareth . Barry, another loan signing it is worth remembering, had been brilliant . for Martinez but he had a night he will certainly want to forget. Not . only was he at fault for two of Liverpool’s goal, it was his collision . with Lukaku that left the Belgian forward leaving the field on a . stretcher. For the two . managers it meant this derby was much like their respective exits from . Swansea City. Joyous for one and bloody uncomfortable for the other. While . Rodgers was thanked for guiding the club into the Premier League before . heading off to Anfield, the circumstances of Martinez’s departure were . rather more acrimonious. In . 2009 Martinez planned to marry in the Welsh city, and such was his . popularity as the football club’s forward-thinking manager he and his . future wife found that nobody would take their money for organising . their nuptials. Until, that is, he announced his intention to move to . Wigan. Suddenly the . bills started coming through the letter box and by the time they arrived . at their wedding day they needed the assistance of South Wales police . to ensure that there was no trouble at the church. Roaring success: Luis Suarez celebrates after getting in on the act in a comfortable win . Finesse: Suarez is already wheeling away as he rolls the ball past Tim Howard . That . anger and resentment has now subsided, to be fair, and Swansea . supporters would probably agree that the two managers who played such an . important role in their rise to the top flight share certain qualities. Martinez . introduced a continental style of play Rodgers also subscribed to when . he took control at The Liberty Stadium and it is fascinating to see . these two men now applying those same principles here on Merseyside. But this was not the best night for making those comparisons. They . are similar even if one is Catalan and the other Northern Irish. They . are virtually the same age, they rank among the sharper dressed Premier . League managers, and they have an appetite for flair and adventure as . well as a tactical, methodical approach. Lethal: Daniel Sturridge coolly strokes his effort past Tim Howard in the first half . The . derby back in November at Goodison was a better example of the . philosophies they share; a 3-3 draw that was memorable for some stunning . attacking football by both teams. Here . at Anfield last night they certainly started with the intent of . producing a spectacle at the same high-octane level, with both men . opting for the same 4-2-3-1 formation. In red and blue there are players to thrill and inspire too. Suarez and Barkley for a start. Bad night: Romelu Lukaku struggles off the pitch after colliding with Gareth Barry . But . by the time Suarez had raced away from Jagielka to score Liverpool’s . fourth, Martinez could only look in in agony; his arms folded, his glare . fixed on players and his jaw going ten to a dozen on a piece of gum. Ok. It was not as bad as that day in Swansea. There will be no need for police protection here. But . to be an Everton manager on the end of a thumping like this is no fun . at all. And certainly not the night for celebrating the respective . qualities of two fine young managers in Liverpool. Better to focus on . two very fine forwards, from England and Uruguay. As well as one or two . others in red.","Both Brendan Rodgers and Roberto Martinez previously the Swansea job .

Despondent: New York City mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner speaks to voters during a campaign stop on Monday, July 29, despite calls for him to step down . Smug: The campaign manager who helped to guide Weiner's bid for New York City mayor resigned over the weekend adding more misery to his woes . Frenzy: Last week, he admitted his more than six-month virtual relationship began at the same time as the People interview and has attributed his behavior to a 'rough patch' in their relationship . Sex pad: Sydney Leathers told how Anthony Weiner talked about renting her a $5000-a-month condo in Chicago . She said she wanted to let everyone know how much her husband had changed and that they had moved on, even saying she was proud to be married to him. 'Anthony would be the first to tell you . that he regrets the mistakes that he made and he has spent every single . day since then trying to be the best dad he can be, the best husband he . can be and it shows,' she said. Devoted daddy: Weiner said quiet time with his son at 3am helped turn him into a different person . 'I consider myself very lucky to be married to him. I'm proud to be married to him, I want Jordan to be proud of who his . father is. 'We're a happy family. We're a couple in love and have a . baby boy who is a reflection of that love and I want people to know . that. I just want people to know we're a normal family.' She continued to tell People magazine how Weiner does all the chores around the house as well as the 3am baby shift. Though it appeared all of his time was spent on acting like husband of the year, the disgraced politician still managed . to squeeze in some extra-curricular activities outside of . laundry duty - this was when he started his online affair with Sydney. 'I have not washed a single piece of . clothing ever. Anthony does all our laundry. I have not been to our dry . cleaner. He does that,' Huma boasted. 'He makes my tea when I get up in the morning. He's just a loving, caring, thoughtful spouse and partner.' Looking ever the devoted father and husband in the accompanying photo shoot, Weiner said: 'Every day since this has happened, I've . tried to become a better person, a husband that Huma deserves and as . good a father as I can be.' Last . week, he admitted that his more than six-month virtual relationship . began at the same time and has attributed his behavior to a 'rough . patch' in their relationship - a far cry from the united front they put . on for the magazine. 'The . fact is that it was the time that my wife and I were working through . some things in our marriage.' he said during a press conference last . week.

The mayoral candidate also mused in the People interview how much cradling his son at 3am gave him a sense of still and calmness he never had before. 'I learned that I always had a great sense of where I was going and how to get there next but I didn’t have a good sense of just sitting and being and feeling and having a sense of peace. 'That's not my m.o. Of all the adjectives you could use to describe Anthony Weiner, ""still"" wouldn't be one of them. I really do feel like a very, very different person.'

Though their interactions started to peter out by Christmas, she revealed he contacted her as recently as April. In an exclusive interview with MailOnline at the weekend, Sydney Leathers unashamedly lifted the lid on Weiner's depraved and bizarre sexual fantasies, and how he sighed: 'Oh baby, I want to suck your toes', while demanding photos of her feet in high heel shoes. The man she said she once put up on a pedestal, she now brands as a ‘narcissist’, adding: ‘I don’t think he’s an ethical man. I don’t think he’s an honest man or a trustworthy man. I certainly don’t think he should be the mayor of New York City. 'He would say all sorts of things, and wanted me wearing high heels and nothing else,’ she said.

"By . Mark Duell . A Lebanese restaurant owner has placed a giant poster of Saddam Hussein in his eatery's window. Ayyad Al-Hamdan, 43, the owner of This Is It in Harrow, north-west London, has sparked outrage among local residents by placing the picture of the ruthless Iraqi dictator on display. He has refused a request from council chiefs to remove the ‘offensive’ photograph, saying it is a political protest. Several people have left angry comments about it on the TripAdvisor review website. 'Political protest': The owner of the This Is It eatery in Harrow, north-west London, has sparked outrage by placing the picture of the Iraqi dictator on display . One Harrow resident said: ‘We live in a society where a cabbie can be told not to fly the St George flag in his car or people can't display them in offices. And yet this guy gets away with posting a picture of Saddam Hussain in his window. It is utterly barmy.’ Another added: ‘I will never go there again as they now have a huge poster of a smiling Saddam Hussein in their window. Are they completely mad or just total morons? I think this place should be boycotted. How dare they?’ Harrow Council leader Susan Hall went to the restaurant with an enforcement officer and asked the owner to take the picture down. She said the owner was ‘polite but defiant’ and said it was not a council issue and it was his freedom to display the picture. Cllr Hall said: ‘We have had several members of the public complain and ask what the council can do about it. The short answer is we are limited in what we can do. ‘The police have also, we understand, been to the restaurant but the owner gave them the same response. The council is currently considering whether there are any options it could look at. ‘For example whether this picture constitutes a potential breach of the peace - but again that is more a police matter.’ She added: ‘I am all for free speech but the relatives of British service people killed or injured fighting in Iraq might not see it that way. ‘Harrow has a multi-ethnic population and to allow this picture to remain in the restaurant window could give offence to many, and could prove a licence for agitators to provoke trouble. Photo in the window: The restaurant owner admitted angry passers-by had stormed into the restaurant and hurled abuse at him - and that he risked offending the families of British soldiers killed in the Gulf wars . ‘Public images of dictators be it Saddam Hussain, Hitler, or the leader of North Korea for that matter, have no place in Harrow. This is a restaurant promotion that leaves a nasty taste in my mouth.’ But defiant restaurant owner Mr Al-Hamdan vowed to fight efforts to remove the offending photo. He said: ‘The council and police have come here and asked me to take it out of the window and put it in the restaurant. But I won't, there is no point. I want people to see it. I told them I will take it to the court.’ 'The council and police have come here and asked me to take it out of the window and put it in the restaurant. But I won't, there is no point. I want people to see it. I told them I will take it to the court' Ayyad Al-Hamdan, This Is It owner . Mr Al-Hamdan admitted angry passers-by had stormed into the restaurant and hurled abuse at him - and that he risked offending the families of British soldiers killed in the Gulf wars. However, he added: ‘If people are upset about it then they can come and speak to me. ‘Go back to 1990. The British soldiers when they tried to kick Saddam from Kuwait, think about how may soldiers they lost there, how many went mad. Now we in Kuwait need help again.’ The asylum seeker, who said he came to Britain in 1997, explained that he forked out £60 for the print of the tyrant in protest over the Government in his native country. He said: ‘The British and Americans said that Saddam was a dictator, and they removed him to give freedom for the people of Iraq. ‘But now we in Kuwait are dying slowly. No-one cares about them because the British government has a good relationship with the Kuwait government.’","Ayyad Al-Hamdan sparks outrage with poster in Harrow, NW London .

Since 2010, 438 commerical and private flights over Britain have been flagged up to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) because they have flown too close together. The worrying statistics come after it was revealed that 361 RAF planes have been involved in near misses in the last 16 years. Ministry of Defence officials had pledged to install new safety equipment in 1998, but never did. Since 2010, 438 commerical and private flights over Britain have prompted safety investigations because they have flown too close together . If there is a reduction in the space between aircraft during a flight, the incident is required to be reported to the CAA under the Mandatory Occurrence Reporting (MOR) scheme. If a pilot or air traffic controller feel that safety may have been compromised at any time, the authorities are also  alerted. These conflicts are referred to as Airprox and are investigated by a specialist team that analyses  data such as recorded radar and voice communications. A serious breach in safety occurred last year when two jumbo jets with around 1,000 people on board were just 100ft from crashing over Scotland, because pilots confused their flight instructions. The two Boeing 747s were 30 miles north of Glasgow and preparing to cross the Atlantic when an air traffic controller spotted they were moving closer together. Last month an airliner that was coming in to land had a near miss in mid-air with a motorised parachutist at 2,000ft about the ground. When air space is reduced between two aircraft over UK airspace, it is reported to the Civil Aviation Authority . The . Airbus A319 missed the flying-machine by only 150ft, causing the pilot . to see the parachute canopy flash by the cockpit of the plane. In 1948, 39 passengers died when two planes crashed mid-air over Northwood near London. A CAA spokesperson said: 'An Airprox is a situation in which, in the opinion of a pilot or a controller, the distance between aircraft as well as their relative positions and speed have been such that the safety of the aircraft involved may have been compromised. 'The majority of airproxes do not involve airliners and serious airprox incidents involving airliners are extremely rare. 'For example, there have only been two ""category A"" incidents - where there is a serious risk of collision – since 2005. 'Nevertheless, any incidents that do occur are thoroughly assessed by independent investigators and a panel of safety experts. 'Any lessons that can be learnt are acted on and shared across the aviation industry.'","Since 2010, 438 commercial and private journeys probed by authorities .

Elite universities charging £9,000 a year for courses are employing overseas lecturers whose English is so poor that students cannot understand them, a Mail on Sunday investigation has found. Undergraduates complain  they are being robbed of good grades because of staff who have ‘thick accents’ and whose English is ‘incoherent’.

Claims: The complaint was raised in a student survey by students in Durham, pictured . ‘Students are extremely critical where they struggle to understand staff.’ Durham is not the only leading university where students have complained. Todd Davies, an undergraduate from Manchester University, wrote online that he found it difficult to understand his Asian lecturer’s English.

"By . Nick Constable . and Martin Beckford . Too much: Ben got caught up in a 'hedonistic' party lifestyle in London . Police and a coroner have been accused of serious failings in their investigations into the death of a teenage boy allegedly groomed by a TV star. Ben Cowburn was found dead in hospital after telling medical staff he had been raped by the celebrity, whose identity was covered up at the inquest into Ben’s death. Now it can be revealed that the nurse who discovered his secret torment was never asked to give evidence to the jury, even though the fashion student’s family were desperate to hear from him. The nurse says Ben told him he was raped by the comedian, and believed he was plied with drink and drugs to ensure he gave his  ‘consent’ for sex. Although Scotland Yard claims to have carried out a full investigation, detectives did not even manage to access the tragic 18-year-old’s phone to look for text messages he received from his alleged abuser. The TV comic himself was never questioned by police or the coroner and, when asked about his former friend this week,  replied: ‘Who’s Ben Cowburn?’ Last night there were calls for the Metropolitan Police to reopen its investigation into the sexual assaults allegedly suffered by Cornwall-born Ben during the year he spent caught up in a ‘hedonistic lifestyle’ in London. An online petition has been launched calling on the Metropolitan Police to ‘investigate fully all the allegations’, and ‘at least interview’ the celebrity. Critics said coroner Emma Carlyon should explain why she failed to approach key witnesses and why she agreed that the comic should only be called ‘Mr X’. A friend of Ben said: ‘We’re very concerned that key witnesses were not contacted, and the police didn’t do a very good job.’ The court heard how Ben was ‘groomed’ by the comedian after moving from Truro to study at the London Fashion Retail Academy in September 2009, aged 17. In July 2010 the comedian and Ben fell out and the teenager’s mental health quickly deteriorated. He returned to Truro but made a series of apparent suicide attempts and was admitted to Longreach House, a nearby mental health centre. A family's anguish: Ben's sister Laura, 25, could not hide her emotions outside the inquest in Truro, Cornwall . There he gradually revealed how the celebrity took him to drug-fuelled parties, leaving him feeling ‘dirty and used’. On one occasion, he said, the older man climbed uninvited into his bed, engaging him in a sex act. Another time Ben said he was persuaded to strip by a group of men and publicly fondled. Ben was found dead in his room beside a plastic bag in December 2010. But after the eight-day hearing ended last Wednesday with an open verdict, Ben’s mother said the family had been ‘failed by the inquest process’ and suffered a ‘tragic injustice’. In a joint statement with the rest of her family, Mrs Cowburn, 52, highlighted how ‘key members of Ben’s care team… were not available’ to the inquest. Emotional: Amber Cowburn, Ben's sister, arrives at the inquest into the tragic death of her brother . They had asked to hear from a nurse whom Ben told about the alleged rape. However Gavin Simonsen-Kuhl was never called to give evidence. Family solicitor Rachel Heelis said: ‘He was one of the staff Ben felt he could talk to. We requested he attend the inquest but were told he was in Norway so couldn’t be called.’ The nurse was stunned to be told by this newspaper that he had been deemed ‘unavailable’. Mr Simonsen-Kuhl, a 35-year-old former soldier, said he ‘found it really, really surprising’ not to be called, adding: ‘Ben told me he was raped in London. All the stuff that was going on in his head –  he was taken advantage of.’ He added: ‘You’ve got to take what he says until you can actually find out the truth. It’s a grey area in mental health, but for someone to go the way he did there has got to be some truth in what’s gone on.’ Told that the Metropolitan Police said there was no conclusive evidence of sexual assault he replied: ‘Why didn’t they go and look for it then?’ The Met’s DC David Gadsby told the inquest how Ben revealed his torment in a one-to-one conversation with Mr Simonsen-Kuhl in which the nurse ‘was quite sure the word rape was used’. Ben had already described other traumatic sexual incidents involving the older comedian and his friends. But this was the only time he spoke of a criminal offence. Detectives found some Facebook messages between the pair and decided they were friendly, but could not crack the security features on Ben’s phone.The Met said: ‘Following an assessment of the available material no criminal offences were disclosed.’ By ROGER MAYNARD and MARTIN BECKFORD . The celebrity accused of grooming Ben Cowburn has denied knowing the teenager. The gay comedian dedicated a gig to the 18-year-old after his death in 2010. But when asked by . The Mail on Sunday about his former friend this week, the TV star replied: ‘Who’s Ben Cowburn?’When he was reminded that he had previously paid tribute to Ben, the comic said: ‘I don’t remember.’The star – referred to only as ‘Mr X’ at Ben’s inquest – then refused to answer any further questions. Standing united: Sharon Cowburn, Ben's mother, reads a statement following the conclusion of the hearing . When told that Ben’s twin sister Sophia had spoken of concerns that her brother had been ‘groomed’ by the comedian in London, he replied: ‘I have nothing to say.’ The comedian was approached again by this newspaper after the conclusion of the inquest in Truro, Cornwall. He refused to answer any questions, and walked away. The comic has, however, made a series of angry comments on the internet about the allegations surrounding him. These cannot be reported for legal reasons, after coroner Dr Emma Carlyon unusually granted him anonymity at Ben’s inquest. At a pre-inquest hearing attended by lawyers for Ben’s family and the hospital where he died, the coroner decided that the older man should only be referred to as ‘X’. Sources say it was because he was not a witness and had not been interviewed by the police. The media were not told about this hearing in advance and the coroner did not make a formal order banning the reporting of the name. Media law expert David Banks said of the decision: ‘I’ve never seen anything like it myself. I can’t see that it was entirely successful or satisfactory for any party. It’s very unusual.’ The name of the gay comedian was not mentioned during the inquest at Epiphany House in Truro, Cornwall, last week . Lib Dem MP John Hemming said: ‘This case worries me. Secrecy does not seem to be justified, but is enforced by the judicial system.’ Under the Contempt of Court Act 1981, judges and coroners can keep the identities of individuals secret, but only if they would refuse to give evidence otherwise, or if naming them would not be in the interests of justice. Even police officers involved in highly sensitive shootings have been named in inquests after challenges to anonymity orders. After last week’s Mail on Sunday revealed details of the comedian’s relationship with Ben, he hired a prominent legal firm to ensure his name remained secret. The internet remains awash  with speculation over his identity, but his solicitors have threatened to sue any newspaper which unmasks him.","Police and a coroner accused of serious failings in death of teenage boy .

"By . Lizzie Parry . This is the face of the vandal caught on camera urinating on a war memorial which honours those who died fighting for this country. David Skinner is today behind bars after a judge sentenced him to five years in prison for robbery. On the same day that he relieved himself against the war memorial in Margate, Kent, the 47-year-old was caught stealing £170 from a flat in Cliftonville, in the town. Pictured: This is the face of David Skinner, the vandal caught urinated on a war memorial in Margate, Kent last month. He has since been imprisoned after admitting robbing a man in Cliftonville, Kent, stealing £170 . Caught in the act: David Skinner, 47, was photographed urinating on the war memorial in Margate, Kent . Skinner was caught on camera as he showed little regard for the hundreds of names of soldiers from the area killed in conflicts since the First World War. Skinner was fined £100 and ordered to pay a £20 victim surcharge when he appeared before Medway Magistrates' Court on February 19. He admitted outraging the public decency. But the 47-year-old was taken into custody almost immediately after his first court appearance as police officers charged him with robbery. He appeared at Canterbury Crown Court on March 18, where he pleaded guilty and a judge sentenced him to 64 months in prison and fined him £120. A spokesman for Kent Police said Skinner is set to reappear in court on May 7 to face a charge of criminal damage. One . of the names inscribed into the part of the memorial where Skinner urinated is Marine Engineering Mechanic Alistair R. Leighton who died . aged 19 during the Falklands war when HMS Ardent sank in 1982 after . being bombed by the Argentinians' A-4 Skyhawk aircraft.

"By . William Turvill . A French firm plans to fatten up a million ducks in China to supply a growing appetite there for foie gras. The duck liver delicacy did not make it onto a list of French foods newly approved by Chinese import authorities this week - despite years of lobbying - and manufacturer Rougie has already taken a more direct route into the market. Rougie's parent Euralis already accounts for nearly a quarter of French national production, and began modest output in China in 2007. This month it began breeding work for a . facility that will house 500,000 ducks initially and aim for 1 million . by 2020, increasing existing Chinese production by at least 50 per cent. A French firm plans to fatten up a million ducks in China to supply a growing appetite there for foie gras . Foie gras failed to make the list of meat products put forward this week for approval for sale in into China. French President Francois Hollande pushed for market access during a visit to China last year and a number of meat products won the right to request export licences this week during the state visit to France of Chinese President Xi Xinping's visit. 'It was a disappointment,’ said Rougie managing director Jean-Jacques Caspari. ‘We hoped things would move during this visit.’ Mr Caspari is also in charge of economic affairs for foie gras makers group CIFOG. ‘We had no choice. From the moment you cannot export and you want to get onto the Chinese market you must produce locally,’ Mr Caspari said. Foie gras is made from geese and duck livers which have been fattened, most often by force feeding. Sold whole or as a pate, it is considered a gourmet food in both Western and Asian cuisine, although the practice of force-feeding has been criticised as cruel by animal activists. California banned its manufacture and sale in 2012. Euralis started Chinese production in 2007 with a 30-tonne foie gras plant. That was destroyed by a snow storm in 2012. Foie gras is made from geese and duck livers (pictured) which have been fattened - often by force feeding . The new, larger plant in the Jiangsu province between Beijing and Shanghai will produce 250 tonnes of foie gras a year initially and should be operating in May, Mr Caspari said. Euralis has 9 million foie gras ducks in France, where the total foie gras duck population is 38 million. Only 3 per cent of French foie gras comes from geese. China's current foie gras output is pegged at between 500 and 1,000 tonnes but there is potential for much more, Mr Caspari said, adding that Rougie would be the sole foreign maker in China. France, the world's top foie gras maker with 19,200 tonnes, saw its exports rise 5 per cent in value in 2013, helped by strong gains in Japan and Belgium, its number two and three clients, partly offset by a fall in number one market, Spain, CIFOG said.","French firm Rougie plans to fatten a million ducks in China by 2020 .

Mr Mrozowsi's eBay listing, which expires on Sunday, advertises his skin as the 'the smoothest, softest leather on Earth'.

But Mr Mrozowsi claims the few people he has told of his plan are supportive - with his friend, Donna McGowan, saying: 'lt really is a bit of a genius idea. He has definitely tapped into a bit of a niche market.' However, not everyone is convinced by his unusual idea. Dr Kadaba Vasudev, a retired consultant pathologist who used to work at Blackpool Victoria Hospital, said: 'I have never come across anything like that in all my years of working in medicine. 'Once the patient is dead the skin dies as well so, medically speaking, I don't think it would be any use. I have never heard of that happening.'

It says it caters to a 'highly discerning clientele' and its prices start at £7,500 for a wallet - with a pair of shoes costing a whopping £15,000.

'I think of myself like an art gallery. After a while the art gets old and people want to see something new and that's how I feel about my tattoos,' he said. 'I've had enough of them and I've run out of skin to tattoo on - so I thought why not get them lasered off and just start again.'

Shortly afterwards, international news agency Reuters reported the official announcement, with the news then featuring on the BBC, Sky News and other news outlets. At 3.09pm, the service's Twitter account announced the mistake. Shortly afterwards, Reuters reported that a 'big tugboat pulling a ship' had been mistaken for an aeroplane by the services. These are the tweets sent by the emergency services in the Canary Islands. The first tweet, announcing that a plane had crashed into the sea two miles off the coast of Gran Canaria, was sent at 3.01pm today . The tug which apparently caused the false alarm on a plane crash at Gran Canaria in the Canaries, off the La Garita area . In English, the first tweet, at 3.01pm, read: 'Canaries air control has confirmed that a plane has fallen into the sea two miles off the coast of Gran Canaria near Jinamar. The number of passengers is not known.' At 3.09pm, it said: 'With regards to the potential plane accident, SAR, air and helicopter control, has confirmed that it is a tugboat pulling a boarding area.' And at 3.18pm, the account tweeted: 'Assistance which is flying over the area on the coast of Gran Canaria have confirmed that there has been no plane accident. It is a tugboat with a boarding area.' The error comes as the search for the flight MH370 plane, travelling between Kuala Lumpur and Beijing, goes on. Today is also the anniversary of a crash between two planes in the Canary Islands. On . March 27, 1977, 583 people died in the biggest disaster in aviation . history when two Boeing 747 passenger planes collided at Los Rodeos . Airport in Tenerife. 'It's . not an airplane, it's a big tugboat pulling a ship,' a spokeswoman for . the Canary Island emergency services told Reuters shortly after it had . raised the false alarm. Photographs believed to show the shipping vessel have been circulating on social media this afternoon. This photograph, which has circulated on Twitter this afternoon, is believed to show the shipping vessel in the sea off the coast of Gran CanariA . This photograph shows the scene of what is believed to have been the world's worst aviation disaster, which took place on this day in 1977 in Tenerife, also in the Canary Islands . While many have expressed relief at the . fact the plane crash turned out to be a false alarm, others have taken . to Twitter to ridicule the area's emergency services. Sky News presenter Kay Burley tweeted: 'Canary Islands emergency services mistook a ship for a crashed airliner... #ShouldHaveGoneToSpecSavers'. Meanwhile, photographer Bette Lynch said: 'Stand down on Canary Islands plane crash. Staff mistook boat for plane. Little clean of the glasses needed perhaps?'

"By . Fiona Macrae . The average British man is four inches taller than 100 years ago. Researchers credit improvements in nutrition, hygiene and housing and the decline of heavy industry for allowing modern males to tower over their great-grandfathers. Smaller family sizes have also played an important role.  But surprisingly, advances in medicine are not thought to have been key. Upwardly mobile: The average British man is four inches taller than 100 years ago . The research, by economic historian Tim Hatton, found that the typical young man in Britain today is 5ft 10in. This compares with just 5ft 6in a century ago. Professor Hatton, of the University of Essex, used First World War records to obtain the adult height of soldiers born in the 1890s. Recruitment pressures meant that the official minimum height of 5ft 3in was often disregarded and it is believed the data is fairly representative of the generation as a whole. Information about on the men’s childhood taken from the 1901 census helped explain why modern man is four inches taller, on average. It is thought that nutrition and hygiene, improvements in water supply and sewage disposal, changes in housing, including the clearing of slums and the reduction in overcrowding all played a role. Fascinatingly, family size mattered, with recruits shorter the more siblings they had.  For example, men with six brothers and sisters were half an inch shorter than those with just one. It is thought that children in large, overcrowded households suffered from lack of food and exposure to infection. Data: Researchers used First World War records to obtain the adult height of soldiers born in the 1890s . In contrast, coming from a family with a high socio-economic status added about half an inch to height. But home-life was not the most important factor. The study, presented at the Economic History Society’s annual conference found the conditions in the neighbourhood the men grew up in, including child death rates, to have the biggest impact on height. The two key ingredients of growth during childhood are nutrition, which builds bone and tissue, and disease, which hinders it. High infant death rates are seen as a sign of disease being rife, overcrowding and toxic heavy industry. Bearing this out, the professor found that the men who grew up in the least healthy districts were an inch shorter than those from the healthiest areas. A childhood in an area with high rates of illiteracy among young women stunted growth – perhaps because as mothers, they had less access to information about nutrition and hygiene. London slums in 1925. It is thought that nutrition and hygiene, improvements in water supply and sewage disposal, changes in housing, including the clearing of slums and the reduction in overcrowding all played a role . While advances in medicine are usually assumed to go hand-in-hand with improved living standards, Professor Hatton doesn’t think they are hugely important in this case. This is because most of the improvements, including routine use of antibiotics, didn’t occur until the second half of the century – long after the growth spurt begun. Professor Hatton believes that female height likely increased in parallel. However, lack of historical data, such as the Army records used for the men, makes it difficult to put figures on women’s growth over time. His data is for Britain as a whole but previous research has shown the Scots to be the shortest people in the UK.  Yet, 200 years ago, they towered over their English cousins. The Southampton University researchers said it seems that the pace of improvement in living standards in England, and particularly the South, outstripped the change in Scotland.","Researchers credit improvements in nutrition, hygiene and housing .

"By . Jill Reilly . Ukrainian former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, released from jail last month after her rival Viktor Yanukovich fled from power, announced today that said she would run again for president in an election on May 25. She also pledged to build a strong army and said she hoped to be able to recover Crimea from Russia, which annexed it last week. The announcement by the flamboyant Tymoshenko set up a contest with boxer-turned-politician Vitaly Klitschko, who has also declared his candidacy, and other figures who have emerged to contend for top posts after four months of political turmoil. Scroll down for video . Ukrainian former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, released from jail last month after her arch-foe Viktor Yanukovich fled from power, said on Thursday she would run again for president in an election on May 25 . She also pledged to build a strong army and said she hoped to be able to recover Crimea from Russia, which annexed it last week . 'I plan to run for president,' she told her first news conference since being released from jail a month ago. 'None of the politicians understand the depth of lawlessness (in the country) and nobody wants to end it as desperately as I do,' she said. Tymoshenko, 53, a powerful speaker known in her heyday for her trademark peasant hair-braid, served twice as prime minister and ran for president in 2010, only to be narrowly beaten in a run-off vote by Yanukovich. 'I plan to run for president,' she told her first news conference since being released from jail a month ago . 'None of the politicians understand the depth of lawlessness (in the country) and nobody wants to end it as desperately as I do,' she said . Yanukovich, her nemesis, subsequently launched a campaign against her and her allies, and she was jailed in 2011 for abuse of office linked to a gas deal she brokered with Russia in 2009. She served two years of a seven-year term, mainly under prison guard in a hospital in Kharkiv, before being released when Yanukovich fled on Feb. 20 and was subsequently ousted by parliament. She was wildly popular at the height of her power 10 years ago when she led tens of thousands on the streets of Kiev against an earlier bid for power by Yanukovich in what became known as the Orange Revolution. But though there was sympathy from many people for her plight during her incarceration, many take the view that she was divisive and headstrong when in power. Her time as prime minister was marked by infighting between her and then President Viktor Yushchenko which doomed the record of the 'orange' order in office and allowed Yanukovich to return to power. Tymoshenko, 53, a powerful speaker known in her heyday for her trademark peasant hair-braid, served twice as prime minister and ran for president in 2010, only to be narrowly beaten in a run-off vote by Yanukovich . When she was brought to the 'Maidan' - Independence Square - in late February to face the tens of thousands who had forced Yanukovich out after three months of violent turmoil in which more than 100 people had been killed, she met with a mixed response from people disenchanted with the political class as a whole. Recent opinion polls measuring people's trust in today's leaders show her well behind Klitschko, a former world heavyweight boxer who has declared his intention to run, and confectionary oligarch Petro Poroshenko, an early and influential supporter of the 'Maidan' revolt who has yet to declare his intentions. Tymoshenko appears now to have decided to re-brand herself possibly in an attempt to distance herself from an old image which could be used against her in the coming campaign. On Thursday she eschewed her hair-braid and was carrying a stick, a reminder of the back trouble that plagued her in prison and for which she has had treatment in Berlin since being released. 'I must stand for president because I am the only person who has realistically shown how to end corruption in all spheres,' she said. Russian President Vladimir Putin chairs a meeting with members of the Federation Council at the Novo-Ogaryovo state residence outside Moscow today . President Vladimir Putin warned the West on Thursday that curbing Russians' use of payment systems based in the United States and Europe would backfire by causing companies involved to lose money and market share . And she went on to argue that, as someone born in the industrial east of the country, she was particularly suited to build a bridge with Russian-speakers there, many of whom are unhappy over the way Yanukovich was forced out of power. 'I can find words and arguments for my mother and that means for those who represent the east and live in the east,' she said. With an eye to Russia's annexation of Crimea, she said she would build a powerful security system and a strong army. Today the International Monetary Fund approved a new aid package for Ukraine saying it does not see a need to restructure the country's debt at this time. 'We don't proceed with programs if they're deemed to be unsustainable,' IMF spokesman Bill Murray told reporters on Thursday. A Russian soldier (left) guides a Ukrainian tank, which is to be loaded onto a train, in northern Crimea . Members of the Crimean self defence forces gather for their morning briefing prior to patrolling the city at Soviet Union founder Vladimir Lenin's statue in Simferopol, Crimea . Crimea's government has decided to disband self-defense forces which provided help to the Russian military which have been occupying since late February . 'So the fact that we're proceeding with the program indicates we don't envisage at this point a debt restructuring.' Murray added that he believed Ukraine's new government was committed to economic reforms.'We've consulted widely in Ukraine across the political spectrum,' he said. 'The Ukrainian authorities have voiced publicly and privately a keen interest in getting their economic house in order.' The IMF's two most recent programs with Ukraine went off track because of the previous governments' failure to follow through with politically difficult measures such as raising gas prices, which the IMF said was necessary to put the government's finances in order. But Kiev on Wednesday said it would raise the price of energy for domestic consumers by more than 50 percent from May 1, seen as a gesture to secure the IMF package. The country's prime minister has said his government was on a 'kamikaze' mission to take painful decisions. The IMF on Thursday said it would lend Kiev $14 to $18 billion over two years to help the heavily indebted ex-Soviet republic stabilize its economy. The country has been in turmoil since anti-government protests resulted in the overthrow of President Viktor Yanukovich, and a standoff with Moscow in which Russia annexed the Crimea region.

"By . Leon Watson . West Yorkshire police commissioner Mark Burns-Williamson drives a car confiscated from a drug dealer . A police and crime commissioner came under fire today after it emerged he drives a car confiscated from a drug dealer. West Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner Mark Burns-Williamson uses a high-powered Audi A4 as a 'pool' vehicle after it was seized from a criminal. Assets seized as part of the Proceeds of Crime Act are usually sold off with half of it going to the Treasury. But Burns-Williamson, who earns £100,000 a year, is campaigning for forces to keep all the cash. A councillor in Huddersfield said the high-value Audi A4 should be sold and the money ploughed into local policing. Almondbury's Lib Dem Councillor Phil Scott discovered the car deal when the commissioner arrived at a supermarket drop-in session in the Audi. The silver car is seven years old and would have cost £25,000 when new. Speaking at a full Kirklees Council meeting Cllr Scott said: 'This vehicle should be sold and the money spent on local policing in communities. 'Use the money to buy a more economical car, fair enough, but do not go around in high-powered cars.' He later said: 'When we have police stations in a poor state used only for meal breaks then every penny counts. 'This is a commissioner who is calling on the Government to give us more of the assets we get from POCA and I agree with him. 'I accept that he will need a car, so let's get a cheaper car. Who is insuring this high-powered vehicle, who is paying the tax and who is the legal owner? 'He's a nice guy but he's slipped up here, he's on £100,000 a year and I don't think this is appropriate.' Cllr Ken Smith, a Kirklees member of the Police Crime Panel, said at this week's full council meeting: 'It's as broad as it is long. 'The money might go to hire or buy a new car, or you can cut out those transactions and just use the car.' The Audi A4 used by West Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner Mark Burns Williamson . The PCC is a political appointment elected to oversee each police force. A West Yorkshire Police spokesman said: 'The PCC uses his own car, but along with all staff working within the office of the Police and Crime Commissioner, he has use of a seven-year-old Audi A4 vehicle, which was seized following a forfeiture order against a man who was using the vehicle to deal drugs.' PCC Mark Burns-Williamson said: 'Re-using the vehicle saves the public a significant amount of money which would otherwise be incurred through business mileage claims or the commercial hire of vehicles. 'This forms part of ongoing efficiency savings to ensure we continue to cost the public less than the previous police authority.'","Mark Burns-Williamson uses Audi seized by West Yorkshire Police .

But instead her local education authority have given her a place at Erith School which is over three miles and two bus journeys away.

Shannon and her angry parents Paul Gunning, 49, and Kerry Joyce, 43, say they have been given no explanation for the decision. Shannon, of Crayford, south east London, said: 'I don't understand, it's so not fair. 'It isn't fair that my friends can go to the school next door to my house but I have to go to a school miles away. 'I don't understand. I just want to go to school with my friends.

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . The use of Tasers by police officers has surged by nearly a third to more than 10,000 deployments last year, new data shows. Use of the stun gun in England and Wales increased from 8,161 fires in 2012, to 10,380 in 2013 - Home Office figures reveal. The figure, a 27 per cent increase, is the same as 199 uses a week, or 28 times per day.

The proportion of cases when the Taser was fully fired dropped between 2012 and 2013 from 21 per cent to 17 per cent. The device was introduced into British police forces in 2004 to give officers an option between firearms and other weapons such as batons. Today, critics say they fear Tasers are being misused. Sophie Khan, legal director of Police . Action Centre: 'The statistics show that there is an ongoing issue with . the use of Tasers by police, especially as the statistics suggest that . the Taser is being used as a compliance tool which is in direct . contravention of the Taser Policy and Guidance.

"By . Sara Malm . Jailed: Richen Turner. 45, spent seven years on the run before finally facing justice in the U.S. A British woman has been jailed after spending seven years on the run from U.S. justice over a hit-and-run accident which killed a 39-year-old father. Richen Turner, 45, was three times over the limit when she ran a red light and ploughed into Peter Cambra's vehicle in October 2005. Mr Cambra died aged 39 when Turner, of Sheffield, South Yorkshire went through the traffic top at Atlantic Boulevard and Federal Highway in Pompano Beach, Florida, fatally colliding with his Cadillac. Turner was driving a 1996 Ford Explorer without a licence and rolled several times before coming to a halt 200ft from the collision and suffered only minor injuries. She fled back to the UK but was tracked down only after the Cambra family hired a private investigator and was finally extradited to the US in October 2012 to face charges after losing a lengthy legal battle. Turner had claimed she was mentally ill and threatened to commit suicide if she was made to go back, but a judge ruled she must face charges relating to bodybuilder Mr Cambra's death. Appearing in a Florida court on Thursday, Turner wept and apologised to the family of the victim before being jailed for six years. During the hearing, Peter's son, Peter Cambra Jnr - who was just 16 when his father died - told Turner: ‘You took away someone who was not only a father, but just everything. He was a wonderful man. ‘I don't believe that any family or anyone should be wondering for a decade where you are or what you're doing, or why you didn’t just come forward.’ Tragedy: Father Peter Cambra was just 39 years old when he died in Florida in 2005 after Richen Turner crashed into his Cadillac when driving drunk . Life lost: Turner was driving her 1996 Ford Explorer and blew through a red light and crashed into Mr Cambra's Cadillac, throwing him from his vehicle . Peter's son, Peter Cambra Jnr told Turner in court that she 'took away someone who was not only a father, but just everything' Shamed Turner told him: ‘I can't imagine what I've done to your family.’ Speaking . after the hearing from his home in Rhode Island, Peter's brother Joey, . 48, said: ‘We were a very close family, but this destroyed us.

"By . Becky Barrow . Millionaire: Hossein Mehjoo made his fortune in the UK after coming here as a child refugee from Iran - then tried to avoid paying £850,000 tax . A refugee given asylum in Britain became a millionaire entrepreneur – but repaid the country that helped him by trying to avoid £850,000 in tax. Hossein Mehjoo fled his native Iran at the age of 12 and won  asylum in 1982 after his MP and a local newspaper campaigned for him to stay. He claimed at the time he would get ‘a bullet in the head’ in Iran. ‘I am terrified of going back. I will fight this all the way,’ he said. ‘They will have to handcuff me and drag me to the aircraft.’ He became a British citizen and built a successful fashion business that paid for a yacht and a home in Worcestershire with two tennis courts. In April 2005, he sold his firm, Bank Fashion Limited, for £8.5million. But he was determined to avoid paying a 10 per cent tax on capital gains, equal to around £850,000. He might have deemed it a small price to pay for his new life. Instead, the 54-year-old has waged a long legal battle against accountants Harben Barker – for failing to get him out of the tax bill. He tried to throw the blame on to Alan Purnell, a close friend who started working as his accountant as his fashion business grew. Mr Purnell, 68, worked for Harben Barker until his recent retirement. The High Court initially ruled in favour of Mehjoo, awarding him more than £1million in June last year. Judge Silber said Mr Purnell was ‘honest, decent and competent’, but should have advised Mehjoo to take specialist tax advice because he is not domiciled in Britain. This means different rules apply to his assets. The judge’s ruling caused controversy because it seemed to say that accountants have  a duty to help their wealthy  clients avoid tax. But this week the Court of Appeal overturned the ruling – and left Mehjoo with a multi-million pound bill. One accountant, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘It was pure greed. He only had to pay capital gains tax at 10 per cent. Britain saved his life, and that is the way that he thanks this country and his mate.’ The friendship between Mr Purnell and Mehjoo began in 1981 when the pair started playing squash regularly. Mehjoo, who went to a boarding school in West Yorkshire, played squash professionally until injuring his back in 1998. Luxury: Mr Mehjoo's Worcestershire home, paid for by the 2005 sale of his fashion business for £8.5million . Yesterday HM Revenue and Customs said: ‘This case shows the fall-out when tax avoidance schemes don’t live up to their promises. ‘Most schemes simply don’t work . . . You can be left with considerable costs, including fees, penalties and interest. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.’ Father-of-two Mehjoo was born in Tehran in 1959 and is a non-domicile, meaning that his official main residence is not in Britain. When he sold his firm in 2005, he paid £200,000 to enter an aggressive tax avoidance scheme recommended by an outside accountancy firm – not by respected Harben Barker. However, when this failed and he had to pay the tax and large amounts of interest, he sued Harben Barker because, he said, they should have told him there were better schemes available to him. As a non-domicile, he could have avoided paying capital gains tax at all in a ‘Bearer Warrant Planning’ scheme. He will now have to repay the money he won from Harben Barker as well as millions of pounds in legal fees. Britain loses some £35billion a year as a result of cheats and tax avoiders, HMRC said. David Minett, of Harben Barker, said it is ‘delighted that justice has prevailed’ after a three-year legal battle.","Hossein Mehjoo fled Iran aged 12 and was granted asylum in 1982 .

"By . Jill Reilly . The mother of a British woman jailed for 12 years in the Caribbean for killing her husband in a car crash has vowed to overturn the ‘miscarriage of justice’. Nicole Reyes, a former travel rep from Rumney, was yesterday handed the prison sentence after judges convicted her of the voluntary manslaughter of her husband Jorge on the island in July 2012. Mrs Reyes, 38, was driving home from a night out in the Dominican Republic next to coconut water salesman Jorge when her car hit his motorbike, leaving him dead. Accused: Nicole Reyes (pictured left and right with her husband on their wedding day) has been jailed for 12 years for killing her husband Jorge in a road crash in the Dominican Republic in July 2012, despite insisting it was an accident . Mrs Reyes' family are devastated the sentence and have vowed to overturn the 'miscarriage of justice'.  Pictured: Her mother Jeannette and daughter Leah Jackson with her young son  Antonio . She insisted he had swerved to avoid . an oncoming car and hit her by accident - but police in the Caribbean . accused her of murder. Her . parents Jeannette and Mike Clements had flown out to the island for . yesterday's two-and-a-half hour court hearing and called it a . 'miscarriage of justice'. Mrs Clements, 62, said they will now appeal the ruling and will meet with their daughter's lawyers today. She said the court yesterday heard from a police officer who she said told the judges that he could see it was an accident. The . grandmother said her daughter was allowed to speak about what happened, . but was stopped when she tried to speak again later in the hearing. Mrs Clements said she felt 'totally sick' when the sentence was announced. She said: 'For someone to know their child was guilty would be bad enough but knowing she's innocent, it doesn't make sense.' Distraught: Mrs Reyes' mother Jeanette Clements, pictured, insists her daughter is innocent . Jeannette Clements has turned part of her living room into an office, working endlessly to help her daughter . But she said her daughter remained calm and that after the hearing she was 'whisked off' back to the prison she described as a 'hell hole'. She said: 'I honestly believed she was going to be set free.' She said they feel their daughter did not receive a fair trial and have called on the UK Government for help. Her parents said they fear for their daughter's health. Mrs Clements said: 'I visited her in the prison on Saturday and she collapsed in my arms saying she was just so ill with so much pain in her stomach and back.' Mrs Reyes, 38, was driving home from a night out in the Dominican Republic next to coconut water salesman Jorge when her car hit his motorbike, leaving him dead . Mrs Reyes was driving her sports utility vehicle next to the Yamaha 125 motorbike being ridden by her 38-year-old husband when the crash happened . She said they will now have to find the money to cover the legal fees for the appeal process and her continuing medical bills. Mrs Reyes' daughter Leah said that she and her brother Luke were 'devastated' by the news. Mrs . Reyes first visited the island on holiday before taking a holiday rep . job with Thomas Cook, where she met her husband, a coconut water . salesman, in 2006. They married in 2007 and had what was described as a happy relationship until the crash in July 2012. The couple's Dominican Republic home which appears to be on sale .

Police told Mrs Reyes they would take her to hospital - but took her straight to prison, it is claimed. Mrs Reyes’ children who are both 18, have moved back to Britain to be with their grandparents and speak to their mother every day on the phone. Leah said: 'We are heartbroken that mum is not going to be coming home but we will continue to fight in court and will appeal the decision. 'Twelve years is better than 30 years but for her to be in prison at all is pathetic because she has done nothing wrong.' A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office told MailOnline: 'We're aware that a British national, Nicole Reyes, has been detained in the Dominican Republic since July 2012. 'We are monitoring events closely and we continue to provide consular assistance to Ms Reyes and her family.'","Nicole Reyes, 38, was driving home alongside Jorge in Dominican Republic .

"Two young brothers who were miraculously rescued from shifting ice on an Iowa river returned from a TV interview about their ordeal to find their house burgled. Corbin and Dylan Crawford, aged 12 and seven, had travelled with their mother and a local fire-fighter to New York on Monday to appear on the Today Show. When the Crawfords returned to their home in Fort Dodge, Iowa, it had been ransacked by burglars who had taken everything, including their clothes and toys. 'Disgusting crime': Corbin and Dylan Crawford, aged 12 and seven, from Ford Dodge, were burgled while they were in New York to appear on the Today Show . The criminals took valuables as well as personal items of the two young brothers such as clothes, games and toys. The Fort Dodge police called the crime ’disturbingly disappointing if not disgusting,' WhoTV.com reported. Corbin and Dylan hit the headlines last week when local firefighters saved then after they got stuck on the ice in the Des Moines River and managed to escape unharmed. A rescue operation was put into play using rope and a boat that was able to get the pair back to dry land after they landed in the slippery situation. The incident occurred on Thursday afternoon near Hydro Electric Park after the boys walked onto the ice near the park's boat ramp, the Fort Dodge Messenger reported.

Corbin Crawford, 12, reaches out for a rope tossed to him from shore by a member of the Fort Dodge Fire Department . A witness said the boys panicked when the ice started shifting. They eventually got about 75 feet from the west bank of the river and about 300 feet north of the Hydroelectric Dam. They huddled with one another as help arrived. The rescue, which took about 45 minutes, involved firefighters throwing rope at the boys in order to send them life jackets. A firefighter in a flotation suit went onto the ice with the brothers.

Emotional reunion: Corbin Crawford runs to the arms of his mother, Barbara Crawford, following the rescue . The firefighters helped get a flat-bottomed aluminum boat to the boys, which they used to pull them to shore. The boat's light weight helped reduce the chances of it breaking through the ice. The brothers were hugged by their mother once they reached solid ground. They were examined at the scene but did not require hospitalization. 'One of the guys here got a message saying they're home and enjoying some hot chocolate and that they learned their lessons for the day,' Fire Department Capt. Paul Neeson said later Thursday.","Corbin and Dylan Crawford, aged 12 and 7, were burgled while in New York .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . No longer on the rise: Baguettes are falling out of favour compared to hamburgers in France . The hamburger is threatening to overtake the baguette as France’s staple sandwich. Three-quarters of traditional French restaurants now sell hamburgers and nearly half of all sandwiches sold in France last year were burgers, up from one in nine in 2000 and one in seven in 2007 according to research by marketing firm Gira Conseil. The market is dominated by fast food chains such as McDonald’s, for which France represents the second largest market in the world after the US. The report also revealed that the French are the second-biggest  consumers of pizza in the world, after the Americans. Last year it emerged that the market share taken by the traditional sit-down restaurant, historically a sacrosanct part of the French way of life, had been beaten by la restauration rapide (fast food) for the first time – partly because meal breaks have fallen from almost 90 minutes in 1975 to less than half an hour today. Last year a quarter of the 970 million burgers eaten in France were sold in traditional restaurants. Bernard Boutboul, Gira’s director, said the study found that '75 per cent of traditional French restaurants offer at least one hamburger on their menu' and that in a third of these cases burgers were out-selling entrecotes, other grilled meat or fish dishes. Mouth-watering? The humble hamburger is booming as the length of French meals is cut short . The sales of burgers in traditional restaurants have rocketed by 40 percent in the last two years, Mr Boutboul said. 'La restauration rapide' (fast food) swiped 54 per cent of the market in 2012 for a turnover of 34 billion euros (£29 billion) - a huge jump from 2011, when fast food only claimed 40 per cent of overall market share. The rise was attributed to shorter meal breaks in France  and the growing range of new products on the market, not just sandwiches but thematicoutlets offering salads, bagels or kebabs.","Almost half of all sandwiches sold in France last year were hamburgers .

"By . Christopher Stevens . George McGavin hosts a news series called Monkey Planet . The most audacious daylight robbery since The Italian Job will have us gasping at our TVs this week - and the criminals aren't human. A gang of rhesus macaques ransack an Indian home and make off with every last crumb. But there's no need for a Crimewatch appeal to catch these crooks, because the hidden cameras of BBC1's new animal documentary series Monkey Planet have captured every stage of the heist. The gangsters have been hanging round a street market, trying to snatch fruit, but an open window in an apartment block tips them off to easier pickings. Swinging along the power lines, the macaques post lookouts before peeping through the window. One swaggers in and pinches a mango from a fruit bowl. Another seizes a naan bread. Then the rest of the troop bowl in - and chaos ensues. Tables are overturned, curtains torn and cupboards stripped bare. Then a particularly clever monkey works out how to open the fridge, and discovers a dozen eggs. Smashing them on the floor, the rascals start slurping them up - until one gangster overturns a tin bowl with a clatter. Spooked, the burglars run... all except one, who darts back to nick the last chapati. 'It's so human,' laughs presenter George McGavin, the author and academic who has jetted all over the world filming monkeys and apes for the show. He had another encounter with macaques at a temple in Thailand, where the monkeys are revered as divine beings. They make the most of their holy privileges, climbing all over visitors and stealing whatever they can. George managed to hang on to his spectacles, but he concedes that it was difficult to remember his script with monkeys hanging round his neck. 'I got one little nip,' he says, 'from a young one who got a bit over-excited. But that wasn't the real problem. There were monkey droppings everywhere, and all over their feet - so after a day's filming, I really stank.' The documentary captures a group of macaques breaking into a house and stealing from the fridge . George is a TV veteran but Monkey Planet is, he says, the best thing he's ever done - three hour-long shows that took him from Africa and Asia to the US and everywhere in between. Filming the snow monkeys of Japan, his team took a thermal camera to discover how the macaques stay alive in sub-zero temperatures. That meant an uncomfortable day for George, as he stripped to his underwear in a blizzard. 'It's TV,' he shrugs. 'You have to show and tell - it's not enough just to say it's cold.' The heat-sensitive images reveal how fast a human loses heat: George's feet and head go a chilly blue within seconds. 'If I'd been on my own it would have been a crazy thing to do. My hands were so cold I couldn't get dressed.' The monkeys cope by huddling on high branches at night and taking turns to squeeze to the warm centre of the pack - behaviour never caught on film before. The sequence that thrilled him most, though, was shot in Uganda within moments of arriving in the forest. As the team unpacked their cameras, they realised chimpanzees were hunting overhead, pursuing a troupe of colobus monkeys. Dr. George said he did meet some friendly primates whilst filming . Grabbing the cameras, George and the crew chased after them, before lurching to a halt - the chimps had caught one of their prey. 'I squatted down on my haunches and didn't move as they ripped this animal apart. The alpha male plucked the heart out of this big colobus, held it up still beating and then ate it. We didn't capture that on film - but frankly, I don't think we could have screened it on BBC1 anyway. It was too gory.' He was shocked at first. But when he reflected, George says he realised humans commit far worse acts of violence - 'and not because we're hungry, either. I still think of all the animals I trust least it has to be humans.' Most of the primates he filmed are rather cuter, though. His personal favourite was the aye-aye, a creature that has bat's ears, a squirrel's tail and hunts for grubs with a long, bony finger that's much more sensitive than its other digits. For sheer adorability, though, an orangutan called Siswe takes the biscuit... and the bananas. She and her colony live on the edge of an Indonesian river, close to a village, and have picked up human quirks such as how to wash their fur with discarded shampoo. Siswe likes to work up a good lather before dousing herself with river water. Then she borrows a canoe to paddle across to the opposite bank. Most remarkable of all, Siswe has worked out how to open a door with a key. George and the crew waited days to film this behaviour, leaving a bunch of ripe bananas on display in a locked cabin. As the clock ticked down, Siswe refused to perform and lazed under a tree instead. 'I'm certain she was winding us up,' says George, half seriously. But when the team were about to pack up, Siswe ambled over, took the key, turned the lock and took the fruit. She might have a career in crime ahead of her... there's certainly a pack of macaques who'd appreciate her lock-cracking services.

"By . Philip Whiteside . and Dan Bloom . Canada has banned a string of iconic British foods including Marmite, Ovaltine, Bovril, Lucozade and Penguin bars, it has been claimed. Government inspectors reportedly swept products off the shelves of a specialist food shop after telling its owner they contained unapproved ingredients. The ban came to light after Tony Badger, who owns three expat shops including Brit Foods in  Saskatoon, central Canada, had his Christmas shipment . impounded by customs officers. Ban: Love it or hate it, Brits will apparently have to do without Marmite in Canada thanks to food laws . Smear: In a letter to a shop owner, authorities said Marmite contained 'enriched vitamins and minerals' He then received a letter from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) saying the products contained unapproved ingredients - before officials removed them completely last week. Mr Badger said he had been selling several of the products since he opened his first shop in 1997 with no complaints. ‘We’ve been bringing Irn-Bru in since the very beginning,' he added. 'My understanding was we were importing legally. ‘We’ve been declaring it through a customs broker and we’ve never had an issue until now. 'The concern now is, with the . next shipment, if it gets held there may be new issues with new . products, so it somewhat paralyses our ability to bring new product in.' Illegal: Irn-Bru also made the list for containing the red food colouring Ponceau 4R (file photo) One customer, Brian Smith, said he regularly visited to the shop for Ovaltine and Royal Game soup - both of which were removed. He said: 'I can feel for Tony on this because I think it's unfair that he's been in business since 1997 and now they're all of a sudden stopping it. 'It's good enough for the U.K., it should be good enough for Canada.' In a letter to Mr Badger, CFIA said Irn-Bru from Britain contained the red food colouring Ponceau 4R, which is not on its approved list of food additives. Marmite, Ovaltine, Lucozade, Penguin Bars and Bovril, meanwhile, ‘are enriched with vitamins and minerals’ and therefore illegal. Other products like canned soup and stock contained too much animal product, according to the body. Mr Badger said he had heard CFIA was conducting a health-risk assessment to see whether the ruling could be overturned. Iconic: Marmite is a British staple, but it is one of several foods banned in a letter to a Canadian shop owner . He said: 'When this health-risk assessment is done we should know definitively whether you can import Irn-Bru.' A spokesman for A.G. Barr, which makes Irn-Bru, said the company produces a Canada-specific product in a specially-labelled 500ml plastic bottle which does not contain Ponceau 4R, and has been exporting via a local distributor for more than 15 years. It is the only Irn Bru product A.G. Barr exports to Canada, according to the spokesman. But Mr Badger said to his knowledge, all British specialty shops in Canada were selling the British recipe. Canada is home to one of the largest populations of Scottish expats. The CFIA has yet to comment. Irn-Bru maker A.G. Barr’s website said the company was working to replace the food colouring to bring it in line with guidelines set by the UK’s Food Standards Agency. However, the company assured the public the colouring is safe.","Ban came to light in a letter to expat Tony Badger, who owns Brit Foods .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Savvy supermarket shoppers often buy in bulk in order to get the best deal. But larger ‘value packs’ may not always beat smaller ones on price, according to a study by the website canieatit.co.uk. It found that Tesco customers buying two boxes of six Happy Eggs at £1.98 each, rather than a large box of ten at £3.49, were paying 33p per egg instead of 35p. Discrepancy: The study found that six-packs of Happy Eggs in Tesco, and 70cl bottles of Gordon's gin in Morrisons, were better value than larger containers of the same product . And a litre of  Gordon’s Special Dry London Gin at Morrisons cost £21.29 or £2.13 per 100ml, which is more expensive than a 70cl bottle costing £13.00, or £1.85 per 100ml. Website founder Martin Isark said: ‘Supermarkets know shoppers automatically grab bigger packs, so when they feel they can get  away with it they make them the most expensive.’ Last year a survey revealed that supermarkets were selling wine for artificially high prices in order to make discounts seem more appealing. One store marketed a pinot grigio as ‘33 per cent off’, when it had only been sold at the higher price for 16 days in the year.","A study by canieatit.co.uk found that sometimes smaller packs beat larger .

In India, it's important that you finish your meal. Wasting food is considered extremely disrespectful.

"By . Tom Latchem . When quitting a job, most of us would have something else lined up - but not Coronation Street's Michelle Keegan. Showing the brassy qualities of her character Tina McIntyre, she's walking out on Britain's biggest show in June - her first and only acting role - even if it means a spell of unemployment. 'There's no plan,' she says. 'I'm going to go with the flow and if I get another job straight away, great, but if I don't then I don't. I have things in the pipeline but nothing's set in stone.' Michelle isn't worried about having a spat of unemployment when she leaves Corrie this June . It looks like a bold decision, especially now there's no way back - after initially telling her she could return, the producers decided Tina would be murdered. Says Michelle, 'When they told me I was being killed off, I got a bit nervous.' Michelle, 26, who's won a host of awards, can take comfort from those who've left Corrie and gone on to impressive careers. 'Suranne Jones went on to do amazing things, and Kate Kelly hasn't stopped working since leaving. I'd love to follow suit. I'd like to do a bit of drama, a bit of comedy. Lots of variation, ideally.' She first set foot on the Corrie cobbles in 2008, less than a year after starting to train as an actor, as the short-term girlfriend of David Platt. 'From day one I felt like an imposter. I didn't feel I had a right to be there,' says the Stockport-born actress. 'I'm a Northern girl who grew up watching Corrie, so it was a massive deal.' Michelle has been on the set of Coronation Street for six years . Michelle admits dealing with the overnight fame was tricky. 'It's a different sort of fame when you're in a soap,' she admits. 'People feel as though they know you, and nothing prepares you for that.' And her strangest fan mail? 'I was sent an engagement ring with a proposal. The guy said he wanted me to wear it so everyone would know we were engaged. I had to send it back.' In her six years on the show, Michelle's been at the heart of gripping storylines, including having a secret abortion, accusing Gail Platt of murdering her father, and becoming a surrogate mother for friends. Her decision to leave has the backing of her fiancé, reality star turned radio and TV host Mark Wright, 27. The pair got engaged last September after a nine-month courtship and will wed in the summer. 'The idea of marriage is so appealing and with Mark I knew straight away,' she insists. She says she wants four children. 'My mum's told me how exhausting it is but when the time comes I'll be ready.' But until June, Corrie is Michelle's main focus - as her on-screen affair with married Peter Barlow becomes increasingly messy, with Tina and Peter's wife both telling him they're pregnant. 'Tina's excited at the prospect of being a mum,' says Michelle. 'She thinks if she's pregnant with Peter's child she'll be more than just the mistress. So she's going to be very hurt and angry if she finds out Carla's pregnant too - and I'm sure she'll want to make Peter pay.' Cats or dogs? Dogs.

"By . Deni Kirkova . An animal lover met her husband-to-be on a dating site after falling for the online profile picture of his black pet Labrador. Katie Beddo, 31, from Darlington, County Durham, immediately thought 'his owner must be a bit of a laugh to do that', and decided to get in touch. Farmer Richard Craggs, 30, had been on Match.com for months without success, so for a laugh switched his profile image to one of his pet pooch George. Katie was smitten by cute George on Richard's profile - who now has a daughter, two year-old Labrador Ebony . But when dog-lover Katie spotted it she was so smitten by the cute Labrador she contacted Richard  to praise him for his wit and adorable pet. Five years on and the pair have married, have a 12 week-old daughter Bethany and live together at Katie's home. George the dog even had an important role at the wedding as their ring-bearer, carrying a cushion in his mouth down the aisle. Primary school teacher Katie said: 'I always wanted a dog so when I spotted George online it made me laugh and think 'Aww how cute!' 'I had only been on the site for a few weeks when I spotted the bizarre profile picture of George. 'When I clicked on it and read Richard's profile the idea he had used George's picture really tickled me so I contacted him through the site. Richard's pet George is a working dog and helps him out on his brother and parent's family-run farm . 'I messaged him saying 'Does your dog know you are looking for love?!' 'We got on great straight away and just weeks later went on our first date and two months later he even joined my family on holiday in Spain. 'As we jetted out he asked me 'So do I tell people I'm your friend or your boyfriend?' 'I said 'Go on then... my boyfriend' - and that was that.' Richard's pet George is a proper working dog and helps him out on his brother and parent's family-run farm in Yarm, North Yorks. As well as hooking Katie and Richard up, George also had a vital role in their nuptials when they tied the knot in the leafy North-East village of High Worth in December 2011. About 18 months after they met online Richard proposed and the couple married the following year . Katie went on: 'About 18 months after we first met Richard proposed and we married the following year at the local church. 'George was the ring-bearer and looked so adorable. 'Now we have [our daughter] beautiful Bethany and George has his own daughter, a two year-old black Labrador called Ebony.' Katie admits she may never have found Richard or George after dismissing at first the idea of going on a dating site. She explained: 'Being a primary school teacher and in my late 20s most of my working day is spent with young children or women. 'Then when I went out with my friends most of them were already in stable relationships or even married with kids. 'Meeting single men my own age was becoming more difficult so my mum and best friends were telling me to give Internet dating a try. 'I thought basically it was not for me at all and went on it to prove my mum wrong. 'But in the end they proved me wrong as clicking on George's daft profile picture was the best decision I ever made!' George was the ring-bearer 'and looked so adorable', says Katie .

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . A mother who was diagnosed with aggressive cancer at the same time as her husband when their daughter was just 18 months old has lost her three-year battle with the disease. Elisa Bond, 39, from Brooklyn, New York, passed away on Wednesday, prompting her husband, Nathan - who is now in remission from stage 3 colon cancer - to write a heartfelt note on Facebook. 'It is with profound sorrow that I write these words. My light and love Elisa passed away yesterday afternoon,' the father to four-year-old Sadie wrote on the Team Bond page.

Doctors estimated the couple, who married in 2005, had around five years to live and both were forced to quit their jobs as they underwent urgent treatment. Mrs Bond worked in real estate after trying out as an actress while Mr Bond was a painter. 'I . wanted to grow old with my husband and care for our daughter.

"By . Scarlett Russell . A woman who had liposuction at the age of just 18 has revealed how she immediately regretted the surgery. Writing ten years on, in a candid essay for Rookie magazine, Kate McMahon, 28, from Los Angeles, admits she was left crippled with insecurity that then spiraled into depression. ‘After all I had hoped for, I felt worse about myself,’ she writes. Kate McMahon, 28, pictured here, wrote about having liposuction at just 18 and how she immediately regretted it, but now says; 'My stretch marks and scars remind me that I am strong and beautiful' When describing her recovery from the liposuction, she said: ‘The physical post-op pain was extreme, but it was nothing compared to how heavy my insides were with confusion and regret.’ The physical effects of the liposuction were far from what Miss McMahon had in mind. In her quest for the perfect skin, toned limbs and skinny waist, the results were anything but. Whilst her thighs had shrunk, her knees appeared swollen instead of chunky. ‘My arms were the same size, but with extra skin flaps, little white stretch marks, and oozing scars,' she writes. She adds that her stomach had extra skin that fell loose around the area. Back at her father's home to recover, her brother had a cute friend staying at the house. Being around an attractive boy, when she felt anything but, only made Miss McMahon regret her surgery more. She felt humiliated in front of her family and stayed in her room, crying. 'I had hoped I would feel sexy after the procedure - now the thought . of guys wanting me seemed ridiculous' ‘Where . once I had hoped I would feel sexy after the procedure, now the thought . of guys wanting me seemed impossible and ridiculous,' she writes. But instead of sharing her distress, she attempted to pretend everything was normal. ‘I was supposed to be old enough to make this choice for myself, so I tried to act like I was fine with what I had done.’ It was during a shopping trip with her mother just before Miss McMahon’s tenth birthday, that she first conceived of the idea of being overweight. In a dressing room, her  mother casually commented on Miss McMahon’s ‘thunder thighs,’ a comment that bred a ten-year battle with body image. After her mother's comments, Miss . McMahon started eating nothing but lettuce and smoking cigarettes, . because she had heard they, 'made people skinny.' ‘Starving . myself seemed far easier than having to actually admit my shame and . self-hatred about my body out loud,’ Miss McMahon writes. As well as starving herself, she would sometimes even binge on food then make herself sick. Miss McMahon told ABC news . on Wednesday that she hopes the essay will teach young girls that . plastic surgery is not necessarily the answer to body insecurities. According to the American Society for Plastic Surgeons, 236,000 teenagers underwent cosmetic procedures in 2012, increasing by 2 percent from the previous year, reports ABC News . The . news website reports that, according to the American Society for . Plastic Surgeons, 236,000 teenagers underwent cosmetic procedures in . 2012, increasing by 2 percent from the previous year. On . another shopping trip with her mother, when she was 16, Miss McMahon . burst into tears after struggling to find anything in a plus-sized store . that fitted her. Her . mother suggested she have liposuction because, revealing had she had it . herself to get rid of her baby weight and was happy with the results. She also offered to pay for the surgery. 'My stretch marks and scars remind me that I am strong and beautiful' Remarkably, when Miss McMahon broached the topic to her father, he was ‘fine’ with it. When she was 18, she decided to go through with the procedure and had liposuction on her arms, thighs and stomach. It was a decision she would speedily regret. She became increasingly withdrawn, even having suicidal thoughts. It wasn’t until a college professor expressed concern for her glaringly obvious unhappiness, that she decided to take action. She confided in a trusted personal trainer who stressed that being happy with her weight and body meant caring for her health, not starving herself. This sparked what Miss McMahon calls her ‘major change.’ Whilst the relationship with her mother is still scarred, Miss McMahon says that accepting and loving herself is her own choice, not her mother’s. Now living happily in Los Angeles with her boyfriend, she takes medication for her depression, regularly attends therapy and has learnt to embrace her body. She’s even stopped regretting her decision to have liposuction. ‘My stretch marks and scars remind me that I am strong and beautiful. Sometimes, it just takes a lot of reflection,’ she writes. Claire Mysko, who oversees teen outreach . at the National Eating Disorders Association, told ABC News that plastic surgery is . often driven by deeper issues such as depression and low self-esteem. 'There’s . this idea that if you fix the surface issue that it’s going to solve . this feeling of inadequacy or insecurity that you’re dealing with,' she says. 'Fixing the body part that you’ve fixated on is not going to solve . the problem.'","Mother of Kate McMahon suggested her daughter have liposuction aged 16 .

"By . Emma Innes . A mother has beaten the odds of 200,000 to one to give birth to extremely rare identical triplets. Jenna Edeson, 27, gave birth to 3lbs 6oz Tommy, 3lb 5oz Henry, and 3lb 6oz Alfie after 31 weeks of pregnancy. The naturally conceived babies spent five weeks in Hull and East Yorkshire Women and Children’s Hospital and are now home and doing well with Ms Edeson and her fiancé Graeme Robinson, 27. A mother has beaten odds of 200,000 to one to give birth to identical triplets- Tommy, Alfie and Henry . But the couple say telling the boys apart is going to be difficult so they plan to dress them in different brightly coloured sleep suits. Triplets occur around once in every 4,400 pregnancies and about 60 per cent are thought to be the result of fertility enhancing treatments. The chances of having identical triplets are about one in every six triplet pregnancies. The Multiple Birth Foundation says there is about a one in 10,000 chance of having triplets naturally and that only about four or five identical sets are born in the UK each year. Ms Edeson, who was in labour for just two hours and gave birth on February 3 this year, said: ‘I found out I was having triplets early on. Jenna Edeson and her partner, Graeme Robinson, conceived the triplets naturally making them extremely rare. They are pictured with their oldest child, three-year-old Hayden . The triplets were born after 31 weeks of pregnancy. Tommy weighed 3lb 6oz, Henry weighted 3lb 5oz and Alfie weighed 3lb 60z . ‘It was seven-and-a-half weeks in to my pregnancy and we were really shocked. ‘The . pregnancy was really good - I didn’t suffer any morning sickness. By . the end I was carrying 11lb of babies - it is not common. ‘The doctors have said it is really rare to have identical triplets, especially considering I conceived them naturally. ‘I had to try and rest as much as possible and just take it easy.’ Ms Edeson, of Bridlington, in East Riding of Yorkshire, already has a son, three-year-old Hayden. The triplets are all now at home and doing well - they spent just five weeks in hospital after their birth . Ms Edeson says her family were shocked when she told them she was having triplets . She said: ‘It is confusing and it is hard to tell them apart, but they are good babies and they are not really that noisy. ‘I would say that Tommy is the loudest but Alfie does get loud when he knows it’s feeding time. ‘Henry . is the cheeky one - he’s got a cheeky little smile. I was excited and I . couldn’t wait to get them home. It is going alright. ‘I have got them in a rhythm where I feed one after another. They are all well. ‘Graeme loves them to bits and our family were all shocked to find out about the triplets.’","Jenna Edeson gave birth to extremely rare identical triplets in February .

"By . Amanda Jones . and Emma Innes . Amanda Jones, 71, lost her 33-year-old daughter, Rebecca James, to breast cancer 11 years ago. Since then Mrs Jones has been tirelessly campaigning to raise awareness of the disease. She regularly visits prisons and other women’s institutions to educate people about the signs of breast cancer. Mrs Jones, from Camberley, in Surrey, has also raised more than £200,000 for Breakthrough Breast Cancer. Now, as Mothers’ Day approaches, the retired radiographer pays tribute to her daughter. Amanda Jones (left) lost her daughter, Rebecca James (right) to breast cancer when Rebecca was 33 . ‘Happy Mummy's Day! This is my best card of a horse EVER for you!’ Small, round, auburn haired,  little red wellies on her feet and my riding hat jammed on her head, my youngest child, Rebecca - Becs - competed noisily with her elder sister and brother in the giving of cards and receiving of cuddles. It would be the same picture being enacted all over the country on that special day - and every Mother’s Day since - precious memories of love and laughter. Becs was born, two weeks late, on June 7, 1969. I'd spent some time in hospital during the pregnancy, due to a threatened miscarriage, so she arrived with determination to get on with life, against the odds. And that's how her character continued to develop - always holding her own with her siblings, Camilla and Dominic, while they made a formidable, loyal and loving trio. She made her way through nursery, primary and secondary schools, making great friends while not overdoing the academic side of life! Mrs James found a lump in her breast when she was just 32 and was diagnosed with breast cancer. She had surgery to remove the lump as well as chemotherapy but the cancer returned and spread to her liver . Mrs James (left) died just 11 months after her initial breast cancer diagnosis. She is pictured with her mother, Amanda Jones, and sister, Camilla . She played first the violin, and then the French horn. She was in the school orchestra and she indulged the dramatic side of her nature in the annual musical - she was always an entertainer, fun-loving, outgoing and simply so loving. Rather reluctantly, she went off to college, in the same city where Camilla and Dominic were studying, and it was much later that I heard about the rescues of Becs that the two of them had carried out, retrieving her from less than salubrious situations and returning her to her rooms. Her social life definitely took precedence over her studies! Source: Breakthrough Breast Cancer . After a year at college, she went off to . France to spend the summer working for Canvas Holidays and there the . course of her life changed. She went to a camp site outside Nice for the season, with the intention of returning in October. But, as the date approached, she spoke more and more about the son of the campsite owners, with whom she'd been working all summer. And that was how, at 19, she found her soul mate, Christian, and France became her home. We, the family, spent so much time with them throughout the years - weeks of such joy, in the sunshine of the south of France, where her auburn hair turned golden and she became our Rayon de Soleil, our Golden Girl. Just after her 32nd birthday, she rang to say she'd found a lump in her breast and was having it removed the next day. Christian phoned, so distressed, from the hospital to say it was cancer and we went over at once to be with them both. When I look back on that fateful call now, I remember all the hope and optimism and determination they both showed, giving us the example we so needed. Becs received the very best treatment from that day on from specialists who would never give up THEIR hope for her. During her first course of chemotherapy, a further lump was found in her breast and then she had a mastectomy, something that the surgeons had hoped not to have to perform on someone so young and so beautiful. Since her daughter's death, Mrs Jones has campaigned to raise awareness of the signs of breast cancer. She is pictured (left) with her children - Camilla (centre), Rebecca (second from right) and Dominic (right) - and her daughter-in-law, Joanna . Mrs Jones said: 'I saw my darling daughter draw on reserves of courage and strength that, to us, were superhuman.' Her children (including Rebecca, right) are pictured the last time Rebecca was able to go outside . On New Year's Eve, 2002, we were all in the mountains above Nice, Becs with no hair, dancing on the table and so full of joie de vivre, so full of courage and optimism. In March of 2003, it was found that Becs had developed secondaries in her liver. From then on, I saw my darling daughter draw on reserves of courage and strength that, to us, were superhuman. She never stopped thinking of others, even when so exhausted. The love that she and Christian had for each other, 14 years after they first met, had such an effect on us all through those last few weeks. On May 27, 2003, just eleven months after she was diagnosed with breast cancer and at the age of 33, Becs died peacefully, with Christian and all the family beside her. It was such a privilege to be with her at that moment. Mrs Jones (pictured with her three children) wrote: 'I know that she is with us all forever, inspiring US to live life to the full and giving us HER courage when we tire and HER laughter when tears are too close' As I had brought her into the world, so I was with her as she left her all too short life, leaving me with the gift of unconditional love that she gave me and the inspiration of her courage. She left so much undying love for her sister and brother and, for us all, the memories of her living life to the full, from the moment she and I shared her birth through her years with us, so full of love, fun and laughter. I miss her desperately every single day, I hear her voice saying ‘Hi, it's me’ on the phone, I see her swimming with Christian in the warm Mediterranean waters and I know that she is with us all forever, inspiring US to live life to the full and giving us HER courage when we tire and HER laughter when tears are too close. On Mother’s Day, I shall think, as always, how endlessly blessed I am to have three deeply loved, amazing, supportive children, even though the youngest of them is now just out of reach, ‘just down the road’, as Becs used to say, but whose presence fills my heart every moment.

"By . Luke Garratt . A mother was left weeping with joy after her severely disabled son spoke his first-ever word after nine years of silence, giving her hope that he might one day utter full sentences. Lucas Kirby suffers from a rare condition called lissencephaly which means his brain has not developed beyond that of a baby. His mother Tracie, 45, was warned that he might not live beyond two, but Lucas has defied all the odds and reached his ninth birthday. Tracie Kirby with her son Lucas, who finally spoke his first word - the name of the paramedic who saved his life . The brain condition means that he is confined to a wheelchair and had never spoken a word - until recently. When Lucas choked on some food and lost consciousness, his mother called 999. Before they arrived Ms Kirby managed to dislodge the blockage and resuscitate him, but paramedics still arrived to check on him. Dr Andrew Mason introduced himself to Lucas while he was performing checks and was startled when the boy said his name 'Andy' back to him. Dr Mason called for Ms Kirby and he repeated the name again. Dr Andrew Mason (far right) with his fellow paramedics and Lucas when he went to visit the ambulance crew which responded to his emergency . Dr Andrew Mason, who introduced himself to Lucas and was startled when the boy repeated his name . While Lucas has not said anything since his outburst on March 2, his mother says she now has fresh hope that he might one day be able to talk. She said: 'My first reaction when the paramedics told me was that they were taking the mickey. Lucas has never spoken because he is so disabled. 'I was just floored, literally floored. One of the rapid response team had to hold me up, I was just sobbing. 'It has definitely given me hope that he will speak again. You have gone from thinking that he is not capable of doing it to seeing and hearing that he is. 'Lucas has gone through so much in such a short life that every day he is exceeding expectations. 'We were told he wasn’t going to live past two and this month he turned nine. 'I have been trying to get him to say ""mum"" his entire life so it is actually quite annoying. 'Even if he never speaks again, at least I know he can. He’ll always be my little miracle boy.' Since the incident, Tracie Kirby said she now hopes her son might one day be able to speak more words . Ms Kirby had been told her son wouldn't survive beyond the age of two but he has just had his ninth birthday . Lucas’s Lissencephaly  means he has a 'smooth brain' which doesn’t have the same grooves or ridges as other children’s. As a result he needs round-the-clock care as regular seizures put him at risk of dying every day. There is no cure and sufferers rarely live past the age of ten. Ms Kirby, who looks after him full time at their home in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, added: 'He is just a happy kid. 'They said he wouldn’t show any emotion but he definitely does. 'He doesn’t need to say anything because his facial expressions tell you how he feels. Lissencephaly, which literally means smooth brain, is a rare brain formation disorder. It is caused by defective neuronal migration during the 12th to 24th weeks of pregnancy resulting in a lack of development of brain folds and grooves. The disease can be identified at birth, or soon after, by ultrasound CT or MRI. Causes can include viral infections of the uterus or the fetus, or insufficient blood supply to the fetal brain early in pregnancy. 'I am proud of him every day. Even with all his issues he is still the best thing I have ever done. 'You go through life with your blinkers on. You don’t think how many disabled children there actually are. 'But Lucas fills me with wonder every day. One of his nicknames is my wonder boy.' Dr Mason, from Suffolk Accident and Rescue Service, said: 'I walked over to little Lucas and introduced myself. 'When he repeated my name after me, I assumed that it was because his consciousness was improving. 'I told his mum this, only for her to say he couldn’t speak so he can’t have said my name. 'Again I introduced myself and the same thing happened, as clear as anything he said ""Andy"". 'This time Tracie was there to witness it - and promptly burst into tears.' Lucas was taken to West Suffolk General Hospital but was soon discharged and is now recovering well at home. Since the incident the youngster and his mother visited Bury St Edmunds ambulance station to meet the crews and doctor who saved his life. Andrew Mascall, from the East of England Ambulance Service, was the first paramedic on scene and said Lucas’s first word was a 'wonderful moment'. He said: 'It was clear Lucas was quite unwell so we immediately started assessing and treating him. 'He was beginning to show signs of improvement when we clearly heard him say ""Andy"". 'I don’t think I’ve ever seen such a wonderful moment. It was amazing. 'Tracie was bawling her eyes out after hearing her son say his first word ever - though I think she was pretty miffed it wasn’t ""Mum"".'","Lucas Kirby was born with a condition that hampers brain development .

"By . Margot Peppers . A theatre professor and costume designer has married fashion with biology by creating a series of dresses inspired by cancer cells. Fashioning Cancer: The Correlation between Destruction and Beauty is an exhibition by Jacqueline Firkins, who works in the Department of Theatre and Film at the University of British Columbia. It consists of ten ball gowns in pattens inspired by microscopic photos of cancer cells and cellular systems, with the aim of prompting a conversation about the relationship between beauty, body image and the disease. Across genres: Jacqueline Firkins, a theatre professor and costume designer at the University of British Columbia, has designed a series of dresses inspired by cancer cells and cellular systems . Biology beauty: Her ten ball gowns are part of an exhibition called Fashioning Cancer: The Correlation between Destruction and Beauty . The images were captured by her associate Dr Christian C G Naus, a professor in the Department of Cellular and Physiological Sciences, and his colleagues. One of the photos shows a brain tumor - with a normal brain area, depicted in blue and green, being encountered by invading cancer cells, which are colored red. This is represented in a gown worn by model Eva Tavares, an undergraduate opera student. Her floor-length halter dress is made from shredded blue and pink silk saris. The scraps of color, which mirror the microscopic picture of cells, are attached to an organza skirt, and the underskirt is made of tulle.

Another one of Dr Naus's images shows an injured area of brain tissue, which is colored faded red. Tiny green spots on the tissue represent dying neurons - part of the process when cancers progress. Theatre production and design student Rebecca Burks models the dress designed to mirror this image, which is made from black silk taffeta, with a red silk bow. Ms Firkins explains that her collection is in part designed as an alternative to the typical fashions currently associated with cancer, like the pink ribbon.

"By . Emma Innes . A baby girl is defying the odds by surviving after being born on the legal abortion cut-off point. Claire Cressey, 34, gave birth to Emily Grace on February 27 when she was just 24 weeks pregnant. Believed to be one of Scotland's tiniest ever babies – born at the legal cut off for abortions - she is so small she could fit into the palm of a hand. Emily Grace is one of Scotland's smallest ever babies after being born at 24 weeks weighing just 1lb 3oz . Emily– who was born the day before her mother’s birthday - weighed just 1lb 3oz. She is so fragile that her parents have not yet been able to hold her. Doctors at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary (ERI) are now working around the clock to save her. Mother-of-four Ms Cressey said it was a feeling of ‘huge panic and devastation’ when she went into labour. ‘I didn't know what to think, having thought I would be having a nice birthday on the 28th,’ she said. Ms Cressey was escorted by ambulance from her home in Coldstream, Scottish Borders to ERI so medical experts could attempt to save her baby. Emily (pictured with her father, Alan) has been on a ventilator for most of the time since her birth . If Emily had been born a week earlier her birth would have been classed as a miscarriage . Emily's mother, Claire Cressey, says she is desperate to hold Emily for the first time . After a four hour labour, Emily was born and was moved straight to neonatal intensive care. ‘When I first saw her, I was absolutely petrified,’ said Ms Cressey. ‘I was frightened to death of her, she was so tiny and they immediately put her in a little bag to keep her temperature from dropping. A normal pregnancy involving just one baby is expected to last for 40 weeks. It is legal to have an abortion in the UK during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. If a baby is born before 24 weeks, the birth is classed as a miscarriage because babies are normally only considered viable outside the womb from 24 weeks. Some hospitals may attempt to save a baby born at 23 weeks but the chance of survival is lower. ‘I just cried when I saw her. You feel shock, horror, fear, it's your worst emotions coming true - everything you never want to feel. ‘Within an hour of her being born they took me to see her. She was still in the bag and hooked up to life support, it was really frightening. ‘She's so tiny it's unbelievable, even the pictures don't do it justice - she's the size of my hand.’ At three-days-old, Emily was able to breathe by herself and doctors put her on a lower dependency CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine. But ten days later, she started to struggle so doctors were forced to ventilate her again, a necessity not uncommon with babies born before 29 weeks. ‘We only got to touch her for the first time a week ago,’ Ms Cressey added. ‘It was our first mother-to-baby contact and was incredible to feel her tiny fingers. Claire Cressey (pictured with Emily and her older daughter, Brooke) was shocked when she went into very premature labour the day before her birthday . Emily is so small and fragile that her parents have not yet been able to hold her . ‘She opened her eyes last week, which was a massive step for us. ‘It was a tremendous feeling, there's no words for it, but that just left me longing to hold her so badly. ‘She's so delicate, she can't come out at the moment, which is so difficult for us.’ Ms Cressey, and her partner, Alan Coultas, have praised the local community for supporting them during an incredibly stressful period. Reverend David Taverner travelled to the hospital to baptise Emily after the couple's eldest daughter wrote him a letter asking him to pray for the tiny baby. Ms Cressey said it was a feeling of 'huge panic and devastation' when she went into labour . Mrs Cressey (with daughters, Millie, Brooke and Caitlin) said: 'When I first saw her, I was absolutely petrified' Emily opened her eyes for the first time last week which her parents say was a huge step . Bliss, the national charity for newborn babies said babies born early often have problems with breathing and gaining weight. They can also be more prone to infections. If a premature baby's lungs are not fully developed, or the baby is very weak, it may be put on a ventilator. A growing number of babies are being born prematurely and more of those who arrive very early are surviving. Many premature babies have problems feeding and have to receive the nutrients and fluids they need to grow through tubes. Recent research funded by the Medical Research Council pointed to a cut-off point in terms of chances of survival at 24 weeks - the current legal limit for abortion.","Claire Cressey, 34, gave birth to Emily Grace after 24 weeks of pregnancy .

"By . Liz Hull . Keeping skin moist, women are so often told, is the key to staying young. But working out when your skin is thirsty and needs a boost is far from simple. Now scientists have come up with an ingenious new ‘pen’ which claims to help the beauty conscious prevent the onset of aging. The £75 Hydrapen works by sending a small electrical current onto the skin, which determines the level of oil and moisture in the tissue . The HydraTest device measures oil and hydration levels in just five seconds, delivering a personalised ‘skin prescription’ to the user and prompting them to treat dehydrated skin. It works by sending a small electrical current onto the skin, which cannot be felt by the user, but the amount of resistance to the current determines the level of oil and moisture in the tissue. The digital screen shows a percentage read-out, which can then be cross-referenced with a small credit card sized information card. This includes a moisture sliding scale, with 30 per cent or less meaning the skin is dehydrated, 31 to 35 per cent indicating dry skin, 36 to 46 per cent for normal skin and 47 per cent or indicating a high moisture content. The pen also measures oil levels at the same time, using bars similar to reception levels on a mobile phone, ranging from one, meaning low oil, to four or five bars, meaning high oil content, on the digital display. The HydraTest device measures oil and hydration levels in just five seconds, delivering a personalised 'skin prescription' to the user and prompting them to treat dehydrated skin . Ibs Ansari, director of BeautyPro, which manufactures the pen, said it was the first pocket-sized device, based on salon technology, of its type to measure skin moisture levels in real-time. ‘The two prongs on the analyser send a slight electrical current to the skin,’ he said. ‘Anyone who uses it won’t feel this current, because it is so small, but the amount of resistance to the current is used to determine the amount of moisture and oil in the skin tissues. ‘The pen will enable individual women – and men – to assess their skin problems accurately at home or on the go for the first time and, more importantly, tailor a skin care regime for themselves. It also allows users to monitor progress to see how their skin is improving.’ The pen also measures oil levels at the same time, using bars similar to reception levels on a mobile phone, ranging from one, meaning low oil, to four or five bars, meaning high oil content, on the digital display . The pen, which weighs around 40g, and is as big as a standard pencil, is portable and powered by a single AAA battery – enough to deliver around 1,000 readings. It has already proved a hit with those working in the beauty industry and early sales indications are it is also proving popular with the general public after being launched in Harvey Nichols stores last month. One mobile beauty therapist said: ‘This is such a handy addition to the services I offer. I use it at the beginning and the end of a treatment to show the difference it has made. It also means I can better tailor products I use on clients and has also increased my after sales.’ Costing £75 it is available from Harvey Nichols or can be bought online.","HydraTest prompts user to treat dehydrated skin based on levels .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A mother desperate for a lung transplant has said she would gladly accept the organs of a smoker  rather than die on the transplant list. Robyn Davidson suffers from cystic fibrosis and has been warned by her doctors she needs a transplant in order to survive. One in three people waiting for new lungs die on the transplant list and she has already been waiting five months. Robyn Davidson suffers from cystic fibrosis and has been warned by her doctors she needs a transplant in order to survive. She says she would gladly accept the organs of a smoker  rather than die on the transplant list . Robyn, who has two young daughters, told ITV's This Morning: 'Yes, transplants are risky, but the biggest risk for me is not getting any lungs at all. 'Anything that I can do to increase the chance, I am prepared to do. I am the mother of two daughters and I want to be here for them.' 'For me, the risk of getting lung cancer from a smoker's lungs in one, 10, 20 years time is very small - compared to the risk that I won't get new lungs at all. 'It's absolutely an option I am willing to take.' Robyn, who has two young daughters, told ITV's This Morning: 'Yes, transplants are risky, but the biggest risk for me is not getting any lungs at all. Anything that I can do to increase the chance, I am prepared to do' Last week the Cystic Fibrosis Trust called for smokers' lungs to be made more widely available to transplant patients. The . current rules are that a donor should not have smoked more than a pack a . day for 20 years. Anyone who has smoked more than this is classed as a . marginal donor. But doctors are warning that many lungs that could be used for people like Robyn are being thrown away. Discovery: Transplant patients who are given . smokers' lungs (right) are just as likely to survive as those who . receive organs from non-smokers (left), a study has revealed. Some . patients even had higher survival rates . Last month it was revealed that one in five lung transplant patients are given organs from 20-a-day smokers. In fact, almost a half of donated lungs come from someone who had smoked, according to a major  British study. Despite . this, the researchers said patients' survival rate was not harmed by . receiving a smoker's lungs and the research should ease patients' fears . about donors who had smoked. Robyn said: 'I have had to start thinking about if I don't get a transplant. I have started writing letters I can leave for my daughters if the worst happens' The . study showed that patients who received lungs from non-smokers actually . had a slightly lower one-year survival rate. The research was carried . out at Harefield Hospital in north-west London. Robyn's . condition is now at the stage where she needs an hour of physiotherapy . every day and an hour using a nebuliser (to deliver medication). She told hosts Philip Scofield and Holly Willoughby: 'I have good days and bad days, but I am progressively getting worse. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition which causes the lungs and the digestive system to become clogged with mucus. Symptoms usually appear in early childhood and they include a persistent cough, recurring chest infections and failure to thrive. As the condition develops, a lung transplant may be required. There is no cure for cystic fibrosis so treatment revolves around relieving symptoms and reducing long-term damage caused by infections. The most common treatments are physiotherapy to clear the mucus from the lungs, and antibiotics to treat the infections. The condition is caused by a genetic mutation which allows too much salt and water into cells - this results in a build-up of mucus. For a child to inherit the condition, both of their parents have to be carriers of the mutated gene. In this situation, there is a one in four chance the child will not inherit either of the faulty genes, a one in two chance they will inherit one of them and be a carrier but not a sufferer, and a one in four chance they will inherit both genes and suffer from the condition. About one in every 2,500 babies born in the UK are born with cystic fibrosis. As treatments have improved, the outlook for these children has improved dramatically. Life expectancy remains in the 40s. Source: NHS Choices . 'I . have had to start thinking about if I don't get a transplant. I have . started writing letters I can leave for my daughters if the worst . happens. 'They are obviously aware of my condition and try and help me.' In . 2012, 188 lung transplants were carried out. Yet at any one time there . are about 240 people waiting for such an operation. Recent developments . in techniques, sometimes dubbed ‘washing’, mean that today just over a . third of lung transplants come from patients who smoked. Doctors . believe that if rules were relaxed further, up to 100 more lungs a year . would become available. These would be from groups designated . ‘sub-optimal’ – not considered good enough to donate . Campaigners . also want the rules regarding age limits for donors erased, and for . lungs from those with pre-existing medical conditions such as asthma, . diabetes and even hepatitis to be considered viable. ‘Common sense suggests that lungs from a donor who smoked can’t be very healthy, but studies have shown that three-year survival rates following a lung transplant are unaffected by whether or not the donor was a smoker,’ says Andrew Fisher, Professor of Respiratory Transplant Medicine at Newcastle University. Some risk continues to exist, such as development of lung cancer in the donor lung of a smoker. Tiny cancers are not visible on inspection so there is a small chance that such a cancer could be transplanted with the donor lung. But this is a very rare occurrence.’ The average survival after a lung transplant is six years. ‘It is more important to get a transplant performed than worry about potential risks that may or may not happen 15 years later,’ adds Professor Fisher. Fears were raised two years ago after the shock lung cancer death of Jennifer Wederell, a 27-year-old CF patient. Sixteen months earlier she had undergone a lung transplant – she later found out that the donor had smoked 20 cigarettes a day throughout their life.

"By . Emma Innes . There has long been a theory that smoking more potent cannabis is actually healthier than puffing on a less powerful joint. The thinking is that when people smoke high-potency cannabis, they compensate for the potency by inhaling less smoke. But now this theory has been partially debunked by researchers. People who smoke high-potency cannabis take in more of the drug's active ingredient, THC . If this was accurate, it would mean they experience the desired high while doing their lungs less damage. However, Dutch research has now revealed this theory is not accurate. The scientists, who published their findings in the journal Addiction, discovered that people who smoke high-potency cannabis inhale more of the drug’s active ingredient, THC. They say that while these smokers do reduce the amount of smoke they inhale, they still take in more THC than people who smoke lower potency cannabis. This is because of the higher THC content of high-potency cannabis. As a result of consuming more THC, they are more likely to become addicted to the drug. However, as they inhale less, they do take in a smaller volume of smoke. Despite this, they still inhale harmful smoke. To make up for the additional strength of the drug, people who smoke high-potency cannabis inhale less. This means they take in slightly less harmful smoke . To conduct the study, the researchers observed 98 cannabis smokers as they rolled and smoked cannabis of varying concentrations. Those who made strong joints inhaled smaller volumes of smoke, presumably in an attempt to reduce the amount of THC taken into the body. But these efforts were only partially successful, compensating for roughly half of the THC strength. So, although smokers of strong cannabis alter their smoking behaviour to compensate for the higher potency, they don't alter it enough to make smoking high-strength cannabis the healthier option.","The theory is that when people smoke high-potency cannabis, they compensate for this potency by inhaling less smoke .
But they also take in more of the active ingredient - THC .

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . When an email asking for volunteers to star opposite Scarlett Johansson appeared in Adam Pearson’s inbox, he replied saying he’d be willing ‘as a bit of a joke’, and thought no more about it. But last weekend the film, Under The Skin, opened with the 26-year-old appearing opposite one of the most beautiful women in the world – and for much of the time, both are naked. Adam, 26, first hit the screen as the memorable face of Channel 4’s groundbreaking series Beauty And The Beast: The Ugly Face Of Prejudice. Scroll down for video . No joke: Adam Pearson stars alongside Scarlett Johansson in her new Hollywood blockbuster Under The Skin where they both shed their clothes . The show paired up those with facial disfigurements with image-obsessed WAGs, to explore society’s fixation  with physical perfection. And he admits being quite used to shedding his clothes in public. Adam, who has the genetic disorder neurofibromatosis, which causes  bump-like tumours beneath the skin and around the muscles and nerves, famously appeared in the poster campaign for the show, in just a pair of underpants à la David Beckham. Yet even he was daunted by the prospect of ‘running around a field  with my tackle out’. Against the odds: Mr Pearson, 26, suffers from the genetic disorder neurofibromatosis and first appeared on Beauty And The Beast: The Ugly Face Of Prejudice . Brave: Mr Pearson's condition causes  bump-like tumours beneath the skin and around the muscles and nerves, and he is an active campaigner for awareness and challenging society's views on 'facial equality' His character is vital to the plot. Scarlett plays an alien who drives around Scotland in a van seducing men then doing horrible things to them. But meeting Adam is a turning point. ‘When people see a beautiful actress next to someone who is facially disfigured, they think he must be  the bad guy. But in this film, I’m the victim. It’s an interesting twist. ‘And my vulnerability shows her something about humanity that changes her.’ He adds: ‘In the end, the nude scene was a bigger deal for her than it was  for me. I’m totally comfortable in my own skin. The worst part was that I was bloody cold.’","Adam Pearson, 26, suffers from the genetic disorder neurofibromatosis .

"By . Emma Innes . One in four people who have had cosmetic procedures on the NHS have lied to secure funding, new research suggests. A quarter of patients have lied about their mental health to get treatment as they did not meet the standard criteria. Many of these people have claimed to have low self-esteem or depression as a result of their appearance, according to research by a firm of medical negligence solicitors. One in four people who have plastic surgery on the NHS lie about their mental health to meet criteria, according to new research . The firm surveyed 1,394 over-18s in the UK who said they had had cosmetic surgery on the NHS within the last five years. The most common procedure these people had had was breast enlargement – 24 per cent had been given breast implants. The next most common procedure was mole removal (18 per cent), followed by breast reduction (11 per cent), a nose job (seven per cent) and ear reshaping five per cent). Medical Accident Group also discovered that 24 per cent of the patients had not initially met the criteria required to receive the treatment on the NHS. These people admitted to lying to get it. They were then asked what they had been dishonest about. Some 41 per cent said they lied about their appearance making them self-conscious and 11 per cent said they were depressed because of their looks. Another nine per cent admitted to lying about being in pain and three per cent claimed they needed treatment because their health was being impacted – for example, some people who wanted a nose job claimed the shape of their nose was making it hard for them to breathe. Inez Brown, Partner at Medical Accident Group, said: ‘We’re shocked to hear how many people lie and trick their way into getting cosmetic surgery or other aesthetic treatments for free purely due to vanity. ‘While we understand that some people may genuinely feel their lives are being affected by their hang-ups, many are just taking advantage of the NHS and trying to get something for free that would usually cost them a lot of money. Most commonly people lie that their appearance is making them self-conscious or that their looks are causing them to suffer from depression. Some even claim they are in pain . ‘These Britons are taking nurses, doctors and surgeons away from patients who genuinely do need their help – not forgetting to mention the risk that goes with any surgery, regardless of how necessary or unnecessary it is. ‘Unfortunately, there are a large number of cases of medical negligence each year whereby doctors and surgeons are too busy tending to other patients to help those who really need it. 'Our advice would be for Britons to try and deal with their body hang-ups and only look for surgery or treatment where it’s truly necessary.’","Many patients claim to have low self-esteem or depression to meet criteria .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Ever felt you can't enjoy being happy in case you tempt fate? If so, you're not alone. Millions of people actively avoid feeling happy because they think it will cause something disastrous to happen to them, research has revealed. New Zealand psychologists have found that we shy away from enjoying the moment because we fear it leads to unhappiness and other unfortunate consequences. Tempting fate: Millions of us fear that embracing feelings of happiness will cause something disastrous to happen later down the line . Others - both in Western and Eastern cultures - avoid happiness because they are convinced it makes them a worse person and others may see them as selfish, boring or shallow. People in non-Western cultures, such as Iran and neighbouring countries, worry that their peers, an 'evil eye' or some other supernatural deity may resent their happiness and they will eventually suffer any number of severe consequences, the study found. In America, however, it is almost taken for . granted happiness is one of the most important values guiding people's . lives. Western cultures are more driven by an urge to maximize happiness . and minimise sadness. Psychologists Dr Mohsen Joshanloo and Dr Dan Weijers said: 'Many individuals and cultures do tend to be averse to some forms of happiness, especially when taken to the extreme, for many different reasons. Negative: Others fear that being happy makes them appear selfish, boring or shallow . 'Some of the beliefs about the negative consequences of happiness seem to be exaggerations, often spurred by superstition or timeless advice on how to enjoy a pleasant or prosperous life. The researchers, from the Victoria University of Wellington, said being pleased with your lot is more likely to be the ultimate goal of Westerners, rather than people from other cultures. The analysis, published in Springer's Journal of Happiness Studies, reviews why we avoid being happy and why various communities react differently to feelings of well being. Dr Joshanloo and Dr Weijers add it is 'a cultural phenomena' that for some individuals happiness is not a supreme value. The researchers believe being raised in a culture that does not value happiness could encourage a person to back away from it. And while avoiding it exists in both Western and non Western cultures, it is more valued in the West. Failing to appear happy is often a cause for concern. Its value is echoed through Western positive psychology and research on subjective well being. But in non Western cultures it is less valued. The ideals of harmony and conformity are often at odds with the pursuit of personal happiness and the endorsement of individualistic values. For instance, studies have shown East Asians are more inclined than Westerners to believe it is inappropriate to express happiness in many social situations. Similarly, Japanese are less inclined to savour positive emotions than Americans.","Others fear that being happy makes them seem  selfish, boring or shallow .

"By . Ruth Styles . While mulled wine and egg nog are the traditional festive tipples of choice, it seems they might have competition this year from an even older beverage - real ale. According to sales figures, the barley and hops based brew has enjoyed record sales as people stock up ahead of Christmas Day. In the last week alone, Tesco reported selling a staggering 1.5 million bottles of the alcoholic drink - the largest amount it has ever sold over a seven-day period. Popular: Sales of real ale have tripled with Tesco selling 1.5 million bottles in the last seven days alone . The reason for the sales boom, say the superstore's experts, are a growing interest in real ale as an accompaniment to food. According to food enthusiasts, pale ale goes well with fish, while malt beer is the perfect partner for turkey and goose, as well as a good alternative for those who dislike wine. The popularity of the drink has also been boosted by the Campaign For Real Ale and the increasing availability of the drink in traditional pubs. Surprisingly, demand for the drink is highest among younger consumer - a sea change in attitudes given that until recently, ale was considered the preserve of older male drinkers. As a result, stores are now stocking a huge variety of different ales, with Tesco alone increasing its offering from 20 types in 2006 to 350 brews in 2013. Of the brews on offer, sales . figures reveal that the ales most likely making it onto Christmas dinner tables . are Old Speckled Hen, Newcastle Brown Ale, Theakstons Old . Peculiar, Fullers London Pride, and Badger Fursty Ferret. Top choices: Fuller's London Pride and Newcastle Brown Ale are both proving hugely popular with shoppers . Christmas ales, including Santa's Beard, Bateman’s Seasonal Ale, Santa’s . Swallie Christmas Beer, Shepherd Neame Christmas Ale, and Thwaite’s . Yule Love It, are also proving popular. Commenting on the figures, Tesco ale buyer Chiara Nesbitt said: 'Ale is an ideal match with the Christmas feast due to its cosy, warming flavours which perfectly complement the roasted, savoury and spicy tastes on offer in the main course as well as with the fruit in the pudding and mince pies plus the cheese and biscuits later on. 'Brewers are increasingly producing new and exciting products with connoisseurship in ale rivalling that in wine. 'With demand growing at its present rate we believe that it won’t be too long before restaurants offer up ale lists with their food menus and cheese courses. 'There has never been a more exciting time to drink beer as the last few years have seen an explosion of small brewers producing exciting new beers, often made with locally available ingredients. 'Sales of bottled ales have been growing steadily since the mid-noughties but this is by far the highest demand we have ever seen in Christmas week which would indicate that people will be drinking it with their roast turkey.' Perfect partner: According to Tesco, malty ales taste wonderful with Christmas turkey and goose . Christmas dinner doesn't have to mean imbibing vats of wine. Whether you're tucking into a turkey or chomping on a Christmas pudding, Tesco's beer experts have a beer for you. FISH . Drink light ales to bring out delicate fish flavours.  Two that are worth a try are Castle Rock Harvest Pale Ale (CAMRA Champions Beer Of . Britain 2010) or Badger Golden Champion. TURKEY AND GOOSE . Malty ales work best to add to the fuller flavour of . these birds. Suggested matches are Fullers London Pride or . Marstons Pedigree. CHRISTMAS PUDDING . Contrast the fruit and peel of the pudding with the . chocolate malts of Hobgoblin ale or the subtle sweetness of . Banana Bread Beer. CHEESE . For mild varieties, a light ale such as Eagle IPA is best, while strong cheeses such as mature cheddar taste wonderful with Hobgoblin. Those tucking into strong blue cheese should try an aged ale which have have great depth and flavour and are best to . cut through the strong mature cheeses. Old Tom which was . voted the world’s best ale in 2009 is a good choice, although its worth noting that it has a similar strength to wine and should be sipped like a good port.","Tesco have reported bumper sales figures in the run-up to Christmas .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . There are a number of hand gestures used around the world that people recognise, regardless of what country or language they're being used in - such as tapping your wrist to ask for the time, or writing in mid-air when asking for the bill. However, the rise in technology is seeing an number of new, tech-related gestures achieving similar global recognition, according to research from HP. For example, the European study found  89 per cent of people can correctly identify the finger swiping motion for 'the next page' - and this exceeded the 83 per cent of people who identified the gesture for asking for a drink. Tech firm HP asked 6,000 people across UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Russia to identify nine hand actions. They included traditional, everyday gestures such as OK, established tech gestures, including 'texting', and more contemporary gestures, such as 'next page' and 'scroll down' pictured . HP surveyed 6,000 people across the UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Russia, and asked each participant to identify nine different actions. The first three were traditional, everyday gestures including the OK sign, made by pressing together a thumb and index finger, raising an imaginary glass to ask someone for a drink, and tapping a wrist to ask for the time. The next three were established technology gestures including holding an imaginary telephone to the ear to signify ‘call me’, tapping a thumb rapidly to mimic texting, and typing on an imaginary keyboard when discussing emails.

Respondents were then asked to identify three actions based on modern touchscreen hand gestures, namely swiping to the next page, scrolling, and zooming out. The vast majority of people in the UK correctly identified gestures for calling someone and typing an email (97 per cent and 88 per cent respectively), while 81 per cent also correctly identified the ‘scroll down’ gesture. James Morrish, HP's chief technologist for printing and personal systems in UK and Ireland said: 'This study shows how new technology is paving the way for new immersive ways of interacting with our devices. As expected, established gestures such as 'What's the time?' had one of the highest recognition rates, pictured bottom. The sign for OK was recognised in 86% of cases, but people in France and Russia also thought it was the sign for zero . There were cultural variations in the understanding of 'zoom out', pictured. In the UK, recognition rate dropped to 18% while France (37%) Spain (18%) and Russia (30%) also found the 'zoom out' gesture harder to identify. Respondents from Italy and Germany fared better, with 95% and 89% respectively . 'We used to learn to ‘speak’ our computer’s language, but today gesture-led technology intuitively works in conjunction with our natural language and movements.' There were some cultural variations in the understanding of the ‘zoom . out’ gesture, however. In the UK, the recognition rate dropped to 18 per cent, while France (37 per cent) Spain (18 per cent) and Russia . (30 per cent) also found the ‘zoom out’ gesture slightly harder to . identify. In addition, just under a third (30 per cent) of the UK sample . said that they didn’t know the meaning of the ‘zoom out’ gesture. Respondents from Italy and Germany fared far better, with 95 per cent and 89 per cent getting it right respectively. When it comes to drinking, Germans and Britons most commonly mimed a large glass when asking for a drink. In France, the most common drinking gesture was the 'wine bottle' mime. Italians used a mixture of large glasses and wine bottles, while Russians additionally used a short glass gesture, pictured . Gestural communication expert Dr. Peter Collett said: 'The findings suggest some gestures can give . rise to ‘iconic confusion’. In the case of the zoom out command, for . example, the fingers actually come closer together, not further apart, . which looks like they’re depicting a narrower, not a wider, perspective. 'It’s quite likely that the inherent contradiction of this gesture will . slow down its spread, even in countries where touch screens are widely . used, until such time as the gesture manages to gain a proper foothold'. The study also found age does not significantly impact a person's ability to recognise new tech gestures with only a two per cent difference in success rate between the over 65 age group, and participants aged 18 to 24. 'This is a story about the constant evolution of humanity and what we are seeing is a snapshot of a deeply fascinating process, as it happens,' added Dr. Collett. 'The younger generation has an inherent understanding of touch technology, and their influence extends to people who are much older. In no time at all ‘touch tech’ gestures will become a part of a universal convention.'","Tech firm HP asked 6,000 people across Europe to identify hand gestures .

"By . James  Nye . In one small swoop, Idaho architect Macy Miller has opted out of paying rent or even a mortgage with her perfectly formed 'Tiny House' - that cost her only $11,416.16 and which she broke her back building. Finding herself divorced, unemployed and losing her home to foreclosure two years ago, the Boise resident enlisted the help of her dad and later her boyfriend to start building her 196-square-foot dream home. The house which is built atop a flatbed trailer - made complete with sustainable materials - has the unlikely boast of its $2,000 compost toilet being the most expensive amenity or appliance in the whole cute build. Scroll down for video . Small but perfectly formed: Macy Miller's tiny house in Boise, Idaho, which is only 196-square-feet - but boasts all the modern conveniences of a normal, lager home . The idea for her home came to Macy in a dream - way before she knew that across the nation a whole community of small home dwellers was springing up. 'It didn't occur to me that it had been done before -- building a tiny house just made sense for me and for my situation, in every way,' she told the Huffington Post in 2011. Home: Macy Miller began construction of the property in December 2011 and has plowed $11,000 of her own money into the tiny home . Comforts: The kitchen is powered by gas and the home is currently hooked up to the power grid - but soon Macy wants that to change . Creating her plans for the house from scratch, taking influence from other tiny home residents, Macy invested $10,000 initially in her new home. Inside the cozy home, every modern amenity needed is available including lighting which she wired herself, a kitchen area, and a working bathroom. $500 – 24’ flatbed goose-neck trailer with 5’ dovetail, 8’ wide.$375 – Under-floor radiant heat system$1,000.00 – (192) 2’x8’, 2” thick pieces of rigid insulation$300.00 – 2x4s 10′ (81), 2x4s 8′ (84), 2x6s 14′ (21), 5/8″ plywood (17), 5/8″ OSB (7), nail plates, wire, electrical boxes, electrical hangers$30.97 – Black and Decker Wiring book (highly recommended), lighting receptacles$105.28 – Electrical panel and circuits$2,000.00 – Composting Toilet$45.00 – Kitchen Sink$701.83 – TPO roofing and roofing glue$579.09 – All plumbing supplies including a $203 bathroom sink and $53 shower drain$354.06 – Drywall, screws, corner metal, nails, mud, paper tape$518.21 – floor and shower tile$886.00 – Washer Dryer$359.98 – Tankless hot water heater . 'I have incorporated every single ‘dead space’ as storage,' said Macy. 'The steps leading to my bed will have drawers, the space above my pantry is sunken to have storage, behind my fridge is more storage, I have built in book shelves and I have plenty of cupboards and space under my bed for storage. Room to move: Macy's bed is above her cupboards which is just behind her living room to the rear of her kitchen . Creating her plans for the house from scratch, taking influence from other tiny home residents, Macy invested $10,000 initially in her new home. 'I have opted to leave open shelving in the kitchen to make it feel ‘bigger’ and more open but will be using shelving that maximizes the amount of storage space available.' Her worst injury during the construction process was breaking her back falling off the roof - an injury which left her needing crutches for weeks. Declaring that she will miss baths the most, her most pressing concern now is moving her tiny house to a permanent berth. The talented architect hopes to one day run the entire structure completely off-the-grid, making it both eco-friendly and space-saving and cost saving.","Architect Macy Miller woke one morning from a dream following her divorce and home foreclosure and decided she would built her own tiny house .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Many people have wondered why animals tend to avoid grazing on land near high voltage electricity pylons and power cables. And now scientists believe they have solved the mystery by finding that flashing UV light that is undetectable to humans probably scares creatures including reindeer away. Power lines give off ultraviolet light as irregular flashes at insulators and as a ‘standing corona’ - a halo of gas - along the cables that can be seen by birds and some mammals. The subject of animals being forced to avoid cables because they are frightened is particularly controversial in Scandinavian countries because of demands that power lines should be located away from wild and semi-domesticated reindeer (pictured) Scientists are not sure why some animals can see ultraviolet light and others can't. It is thought that some use it to see in the dark as well as spotting potential mates or predators. Reindeer for example see UV light and it helps them spot polar bears that appear to be incredibly well camouflaged in white snow. Bees and other insects use their UV vision to see colours and patterns on plants. Rodents use it to follow trails of urine, but they are not sure what pets use it for. Experts also question why human eyes filter out UV light. Some think it could be to protect the delicate retina, but other animals that live for a long time and see UV do not have damaged eyes. Other scientists consider that the human eye is best suited to seeing detailed images in low levels of light, whereas other creatures that see UV tend to see in less detail. It is thought that reindeer see the UV range as the Arctic is rich in UV light and it might even help them spot polar bears. A recent study found that around 35 species of animals, including cats and dogs, can see light that humans cannot. Scientists from University College London (UCL), Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, UIT The Arctic University of Norway and the University of Oslo in Norway investigated the phenomenon to investigate whether pylons have detrimental effects on populations of reindeer. The mystery of mammals and birds avoiding high voltage power lines has been recognised for some time but had puzzled scientists because suspended cables are neither a barrier to wildlife nor are regularly associated with humans. The subject of animals being forced to avoid cables is particularly controversial in Scandinavian countries because of demands that power lines should be located away from wild and semi-domesticated reindeer - the latter herded by indigenous Saami people who depend on the animals. Populations of wild reindeer in Norway can sometimes fragment because they ‘cannot’ roam freely because of power lines, leading to the creation of 23 distinct herds in southern Norway, The Independent reported. Professor Glen Jeffery of UCL, said: ‘New information about animal vision along with the characteristics of power lines, provides strong evidence that the avoidance may be linked with animals’ ability to detect ultraviolet flashing on power lines that humans cannot see and which they find frightening.’ By choosing to avoid power lines, animals such as reindeer face disruption of migration and substantial loss of grazing land. This can affect the growth and genetic variability of populations. For reindeer in particular it influences the wellbeing of herds and of herders who rely on the animals for their livelihoods, cultural identity and food, the experts said. The effect may be more pronounced in snowy areas where the ultraviolet light is reflected and scattered by snow, they explained. In dark Arctic winters, the team argues, power lines do not appear to reindeer merely as impassive, grey structures but rather as lines of flashing lights stretching across the terrain. High voltage power cables can cause a build-up of ionised gas that means they have a ultraviolet glow as well as occasional bursts of light. Power companies work hard to stop such bursts because they cause power leakage, but it is almost impossible to eliminate them. Scientists think that the UV filter in the human eye means that we can see more accurately than without it. Humans can see in such detail because we have dense colour-sensitive cells (cones) in the retina (pictured) that convert light to create detailed images in dim conditions . British researchers found that a whole plethora of mammals, including dogs, cats, hedgehogs and ferrets can see in UV, giving them a better view at night among other benefits. It was previously thought that only a handful of mammals could see ultraviolet light, but the new study could help scientists shed some light on why pets behave the way they do. Ron Douglas, a biologist at City University London, in England told LiveScience: ‘Nobody ever thought these animals could see in ultraviolet, but in fact, they do.’ Light is made up of a spectrum of colours and humans can see from red to violet, whereas many animals, such as bees, fish, reptiles and amphibians can see ultraviolet wavelengths invisible to humans. A number of mammals including bats, reindeer and some mice and moles are already known to see in ultraviolet, but scientists are not sure why some animals have it and others, as well as humans, do not. The lens of the human eye blocks ultraviolet light, but in some animals UV can reach the retina and the light is converted into nerve signals, which travel to the brain and are processed. To explore which animals possess the capability to see ultraviolet light, the researchers obtained eyes from a wide array of mammals that had died in zoos, vets, science labs or slaughterhouses. They measured how much light got through each animal’s eye to the retina. Scientists found that many of the animals, including cats, dogs, hedgehogs, ferrets and okapi, have lenses that let some ultraviolet light though, suggesting that they can see well in the dark. Scientists already know that bees and other insects use their UV vision to see colours and patterns on plants, while rodents use it to follow trails of urine, but they are not sure what pets use it for.","Scientists from University College London found that the UV flashes can cause the fragmentation of reindeer populations in Norway .

"By . Eleanor Harding . Ryan Zon a teenage footballer suffered a massive heart attack on the pitch in Sheffield - and was brought back to life by the team of medics he was playing against . A teenage footballer who almost died from a heart attack during a game was saved because he happened to be playing against a team of medics. Ryan Zon, 19, was ‘effectively dead’ for ten minutes after collapsing in front of horrified spectators. By extraordinary good fortune the opposition was made up of doctors who gave him cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) while an ambulance was called. The drama has echoes of the incident last year involving Fabrice Muamba who was playing for Bolton when he suffered a cardiac arrest and his heart stopped beating for 78 minutes. Muamba survived after a consultant cardiologist at the game as a fan helped to treat him on the pitch. Ryan’s family say he would have died on the pitch if the footballing medics had not battled to revive him. Tests revealed the heart attack was caused by one of his arteries growing the wrong way, which stopped the blood circulating. Ryan, described by friends as a ‘keep-fit fanatic’, is stable in hospital but will need open heart surgery. His mother Tracey, 47, said: ‘We owe everything to those doctors. Talk about being in the right place at the right time – Ryan will never be as lucky again. ‘We can’t thank them enough. Ryan has asked what would have happened if they’d not been there and I’ve told him we would have been burying him. It’s unbelievable to think how close we were to losing him.’ Ryan, from Aston in Sheffield, collapsed while playing as a winger for Swallownest Miners Welfare Reserves last weekend. The match, at the city’s Norton playing fields, was against Sheffield Medics FC which consists of doctors and trainee medics. When Ryan fell his team-mates thought it was a seizure but the medics instantly recognised it as a heart attack and took it in turns to give him CPR. The football team who helped save Ryan Zon. The opposition players were a team of doctors and trainee medics - who, along with two other doctors who happened to be nearby, gave him CPR until an ambulance arrived . Ryan Zon (second left) pictured here a few years ago. He collapsed like professional Fabrice Muamba in the middle of a game, in front of horrified team mates and spectators . Two doctors playing rugby nearby joined in until the ambulance arrived. The prognosis for Ryan is good although he will have to give up football. Muamba was also forced to retire. It means Ryan will have to stop coaching disabled children with Rotherham United during the school holidays, which he did last summer. Mrs Zon added: ‘He could have played football or cricket professionally, but he will never kick a ball again. I know he will struggle with that, but we just have to be thankful he is still alive.’ The family are calling for all football clubs to have defibrillators – which give the heart a potentially life-saving electric shock – on hand. Ryan’s team manager Dixie Nightingale, 52, said: ‘People saw it live on TV when Fabrice Muamba had a heart attack – and to see it happen in front of your own eyes to one of your own players was shocking.’ Iain Ruddick, secretary of Sheffield Medics FC, added: ‘Everyone in the club is delighted there was a happy ending. Our players went into doctor mode and did the CPR taught from day one at medical school.’","Ryan Zon, 19, was ‘effectively dead’ for ten minutes after collapsing .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Prisoner Of War Jeremiah Denton, who survived 7 years locked in a tiny windowless cell in Hanoi during the Vietnam war, has passed away in his Virginia home, aged 89. The veteran famously alerted the U.S. military to conditions at the 'Hanoi Hilton' and other camps when he blinked the word 'torture' in Morse code during a television interview - a message missed by his captors. Denton, who was released from captivity in 1973, died of heart problems Friday, his grandson Edward Denton said. After returning from Vietnam, the elder Denton became the first Republican from Alabama elected to the U.S. Senate since Reconstruction. Scroll down for video . Passed away: POW Jeremiah Denton, pictured in 1999, died Friday. He was 89 . However, the iron will that allowed him to persevere in the small, stinking cell gave rise to criticism he was too rigid a politician. In July 1965, a month after he began flying combat missions for the U.S. Navy in Vietnam, the Mobile native was shot down near Thanh Hoa. He was captured and recalled his captivity in a book titled 'When Hell Was in Session.' 'They beat you with fists and fan belts,' he told the Los Angeles Times in 1979. 'They warmed you up and threatened you with death. Then they really got serious and gave you something called the rope trick.' The use of ropes — to cut off circulation in his limbs — left him with no feeling in his fingertips and intense muscle spasms, he said. Some of the most severe torture came after the 1966 interview, in which he confounded his captors by saying that he continued to fully support the U.S. government, 'and I will support it as long as I live.' 'In the early morning hours, I prayed that I could keep my sanity until they released me. I couldn't even give in to their demands, because there were none. It was pure revenge,' Denton wrote. The tape was widely seen, and U.S. intelligence experts had picked up the Morse Code message. Capture: In July 1965, a month after Denton, pictured as a young pilot, began flying combat missions for the U.S. Navy in Vietnam, the Mobile native was shot down near Thanh Hoa and he was captured . But Denton theorized later that his . captors likely figured it out only after he was awarded the Navy Cross — . the second-highest decoration for valor — for the blinks in 1974. He . said his captors never brought him out for another interview. But with . the war's end drawing closer, he was released in February 1973. Denton was the senior officer among former POWs who stepped off a plane into freedom at Clark Air Base in the Philippines. Denton epitomized the military spirit . as he spoke for the returning soldiers: 'We are honored to have had the . opportunity to serve our country under difficult circumstances. We are . profoundly grateful to our commander-in-chief and to our nation for this . day. God bless America.' His words and bearing, beamed back to his country by television, gave heart to the military at a time of increasing uncertainty and bitter division over the course of the war. He was promoted to rear admiral and retired from the Navy in November 1977. Denton then turned to politics, despite having no experience running for a statewide political office. With Ronald Reagan atop the GOP ticket, Denton became the first Republican elected to the Senate from Alabama since the Reconstruction era following the Civil War. In Washington, he was a Reagan loyalist, a defender of military might and an advocate for a return to traditional family values and conservative stands on moral issues. But critics said his rigid stands left him no room for political compromise and lessened his influence, limiting his ability to help Alabama. Senator: Denton, pictured in 1981, retired from the Navy in November 1977 and then turned to politics, despite having no experience running for a statewide political office . Denton lost his re-election bid in 1986 by only a fraction of a percentage point. After his defeat, Denton founded the Coalition for Decency and lectured about family causes. Denton also launched a humanitarian outreach to needy countries through his National Forum Foundation, which arranged shipments of donated goods. 'He was a war hero, an honorable senator, and a family man who cared deeply about his country,' said a statement from U.S. Senator Richard Shelby, who as a Democrat defeated Denton in 1986. Shelby switched to the GOP in 1994 and was elected to a fifth term in 2010. Arizona Senator John McCain, who also was held captive as a POW in Vietnam, described Denton as his mentor. 'As a senior ranking officer in prison, Admiral Denton's leadership inspired us to persevere, and to resist our captors, in ways we never would have on our own,' McCain said. In later years, Denton lived in Williamsburg, Virginia, but he still appeared at patriotic gatherings. In November 2008, an emotional Denton watched at Battleship Memorial Park in Mobile, Alabama, as a newly restored A-6 Intruder fighter/bomber — like the one he flew over North Vietnam — was rolled out in his honor. Denton's grandson, Edward, said that on one hand, Denton was a normal grandfather who enjoyed taking his grandchildren fishing aboard his boat in Mobile. 'On the other hand,' he said, 'he was a war hero and someone who set an example for what being a good, patriotic American is all about.'","Denton, who was released from captivity in 1973, died of heart problems Friday, his grandson Edward Denton said .

First look: Chloe Green has unveiled a new footwear and accessories range, which will be landing in Topshop, Miss Selfridge and on her website today . The result? A 12-strong trend-led collection of monochrome wedges, studded stilettos and butterfly applique embellished sandals designed to take her wearers from desk to dancefloor this summer. 'I am following the trend for lower heels this season but I didn't take much inspiration from the catwalks because I always want to base my designs on what I'd wear myself. I don't want to lose what's me,' she explained. Speaking about her personal style, she said: 'I would say I'm edgy chic but effortlessly put together. I love Givenchy and YSL and high street wise, I usually shop in Topshop and I love Zara at the moment.' New range: Chloe, who isn't modelling the range herself this season, has created a 12-strong trend-led collection of heels and sandals . Staying true to her style: Chloe, who describes her look as 'edgy chic', hopes her new footwear reflects her personal style . In keeping with her signature style, each shoe has a green sole and is named by Chloe herself. The former Made In Chelsea star has named each shoe after places she visited across the Americas - and from Upper East to Rio de Janeiro, the city styles are reflected in each design. She has aimed to create fashionable and flattering designs, explaining: 'I have designed the shoes so they don't cut above your ankle - they make your legs look longer.' Her . roster of celebrity fans now includes the likes of A-listers Kim Kardashian, Demi Lovato and . Nicole Ritchie and she is hoping her latest green-soled shoe collection proves just as popular. Low point: Chloe's new range incorporates the trend for lower heels, which she says Kate Moss will love . 'I have sent some to Emma Roberts and Rita Ora, Cara Delevingne and Naomi Campbell will be coming to my launch event so I am really excited to introduce them to the range and see which designs they choose. 'Rita's style is so cool, I love it. I think that by wearing them, she will inspire people to wear them in a different way.' Chloe also has a pair with Kate Moss' name on - the good friends recently holidayed together and Kate is set to unveil a clothing collection in Topshop this season. 'Kate loves lower heels, so I think she will covet the Pasadina shoe I have created,' said Chloe. Globetrotter: Chloe, pictured, left, with father Sir Philip and, right, with Kate Moss, is already planning her summer travels and winter collection . Moss style: Chloe says the Passadena sandals are right up Kate's street . Chloe, who couldn't live without her bronzer and describes her beauty look as 'natural', has plans to take her range forward. 'I am taking the future as it comes. I am looking forward to doing some more travelling and heading to the Grand Prix but I am so pleased with how the collection has turned out and I'm already working on my winter range. 'Who knows, perhaps some going out dresses to complement my shoes could be my next step,' she said.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . These pictures show how a Catholic monastery which was owned by Henry VIII and Elizabeth I has been converted into a luxury home with a £5.5million price tag. Horton Priory in Ashford, Kent was built in the 12th century - although within its grounds are parts of a settlement dating back as far as the early Iron Age. The complex was originally owned by King Henry I, but he later handed it over to the Cluniac order of monks to be converted into a medieval priory. After the dissolution of the monasteries it was seized by Henry VIII, who passed it on to his daughter Elizabeth before the home was given to the Mantell family in 1970. The Grade I-listed mansion is situated in 55 acres of land, and has undergone a thorough makeover to turn it into a modern home. It now boasts a private cinema, wine cellar, swimming pool, 11 bedrooms and even a driving range.

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . Embattled New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie kept his presidential hopes alive on Friday with an hour-long press conference that saw him tussling with journalists while insisting that his hands were clean in the 'Bridgegate' fiasco. 'The fact of the matter is I had nothing to do with this, as I said from the beginning,' he said of a September 2013 plot to close down on-ramp lanes to the George Washington Bridge as political payback for a Democratic mayor who failed to endorse his re-election effort. 'In the long sweep of things,' he predicted coyly, 'any voters, if they consider this issue at all, in considering my candidacy – if there ever is one at all – I’ve got a feeling it'll be a small element of it, if any element at all,' said Christie. But reporters scraped and kicked their way to a series of gubernatorial outbursts that could portend one of American history's most colorful White House press briefing rooms. Scroll down for video . New Jersey Governor Chris Christie sparred with reporters for an hour on Friday, while announcing the resignation of  the chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey . A media crush met Christie in the New Jersey state capitol building as pressure built for him to comment publicly on the 'Bridgegate' scandal that has embroiled the potential 2016 Republican presidential contender . One journalist's pointed question, Christie scowled, was 'so awful that it’s beneath the job you hold.' He barked to another: 'You have to get the facts right if you’re going to ask me a question.' When the dust settled, he turned passive-aggressive in a way that New Jerseyans have come to recognize. 'It's such a joy and relief to be finally able to come back and interact with you in the kind and gentle way we always have,' Christie said to a room bulging with tape recorders, notebooks and TV cameras. 'I'd love to say I missed you, but I didn't. But I'm looking forward to having you all back on a regular basis.' Christie's last press conference was on January 9 and lasted two hours. He conceded during both events that the bridge scandal had shaken the confidence he once placed in his most senior staffers. 'It's obvious to me that I have to make clearer ... what's acceptable conduct and what is not,' he said Friday. Friday's defiant Q-and-A came a day after the release of a formal report, commissioned by the governor and written by a hand-picked law firm. The embattled governor has a reputation for fearlessly taking as many questions as media organizations want to throw at him, and his answers are often headline-worthy . Attorney Randy Mastro delivered a lengthy Bridgegate report to reporters on Thursday, exonerating Christie but enraging Democrats who say the authors failed to talk to at leas ttwo key witnesses . The lengthy examination of the events of Sept. 9-13 exonerated Christie, while also leaving the door open for questions about the independence of the investigators. But the Republican swashbuckler who figures prominently in most predictions of the GOP's 2016 presidential field – 'They love me in Iowa,' he told ABC's Diane Sawyer on Thursday – stood by the document's findings. 'This report has supported exactly what I said,' he told a packed room of reporters. David Samson, a former New jersey attorney general and a long-time Christie ally, resigned Friday from his post as chairman of the powerful Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the George Washington Bridge . The report's authors, he insisted, 'have their own professional and personal reputations. Six of them were former federal prosecutors. They're not going to whitewash anything for me and put their reputations at stake.' He declared that their work product would 'stand the test of time – and it will be tested by the other investigations that are going on. New Jersey U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman – Christie's successor in the job, and not a fan of the governor – is running his own investigation. A New Jersey special legislative committee dominated by New Jersey lawmakers is running its own probe. Two of those partisans fired back Friday afternoon, saying the report was incomplete because it didn't include input from Bridget Kelly, the former deputy chief of staff whom Christie fired in January after the bridge scheme became national news. Kelly sent an infamous email to David Wildstein, a Christie appointee at the New York/New Jersey port authority – which operates the George Washington Bridge – apparently signaling that a plan to alter its traffic patterns should go ahead. 'If we don't hear from the person who put the lane closures into motion, Bridget Kelly, who we know sent the email ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee"" ... if we don't know why she sent that email, if we don't know who gave her the authority to send that email, if we don't know what she thought she may be accomplishing by sending that email, then we can't have a complete picture of what happened here,' Democratic Assemblyman John Wisniewski told the Newark Star-ledger. Wildstein, the Port Authority . official, resigned in early December, and has since refused to testify . before the legislative committee in Trenton. Christie said Friday that it 'was a mistake' to hire him. The man at the top of the Port Authority, David Samson, quit his post on Friday. Samson's . departure didn't appear related to the report, although the governor . said he had 'tendered his resignation to me, effective immediately,' earlier in the day. Samson also didn't figure in the report itself – because, as with the case of Bridget Kelly, investigators never spoke with him. Bad girl: Former Christie deputy chief of staff Bridget Anne Kelly appears to have been the driving force behind a plot to punish a Democratic New Jersey mayor by creating traffic jams in his town; Christie publicly fired her in January . Troublemaker: Former Port Authority official David Wildstein (C) implemented a days-long scheme to dlose lanes of the George Washington Bridge, and inspected the results . 'The Governor's top appointee at the Port Authority refuses to be interviewed for the administration's report and then resigns the day after it comes out,' Wisneiwski noted in a joint statement Friday afternoon with fellow Democrat Loretta Weinberg, 'leaving us once again with far more questions than answers.' 'Any credible examination of the lane closures should be focused on uncovering the facts, not exonerating the governor or anyone else,' the two lawmakers said. Cleared or not, a feisty and defiant Christie seemed to outlast a national press corps that was eager to see him slip. Answering questions about how a plot to abuse traffic resources for political revenge could have escaped his notice. As a chief executive, he said, deputies sledom strode into his office to brief him on minutiae. 'That's not the way it works,' he insisted.","Christie said the politically motivated bridge lane closures in 2013 will be 'be a small element ... if any element at all' of his potential presidential future .

"By . Alexandra Klausner . One artist created an intricate model of a fast food restaurant entirely out of wood . Roxy Paine created the piece 'Carcass', an installation comprised of two large scale dioramas at the Kavi Gupta gallery in Chicago. This is part of 'Apparatus', Paine's first solo show in Chicago. Paine's replica leaves no detail behind and is equipped with a deep fryer and a soft serve ice-cream machine. What's missing however,  are big logos and any semblance of food. The other diorama is meant to resemble a control room with an unknown function, reports thisiscolassal.com. The models are made of birch, maple, glass, and are accented by fluorescent lighting. 'Paine transforms the environments on display by using the diorama’s traditional experience as a tool to create a contemplative experience where what we see behind the glass transitions between being real and being a mere shell of something real,' says the gallery's website. The gallery's website explains that in the Greek language diorama quite literally translates to, 'through that which is seen.' 'Roxy Paine introduces a new chapter in his work, a series of large scale dioramas. Inspired by spaces and environments designed to be activated via human interaction, a fast-food restaurant and a control room, the dioramas present spaces and objects which are hand carved from birch and maple wood and formed from steel, encased and frozen in time, void of human presence, making their inherent function obsolete,' explains the website. The spaces the artist creates are reliant on the viewer's 'human interaction' to give them a function and are otherwise devoid of meaning. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Wood you eat in this kitchen?

"By . Deni Kirkova . An occasional dessert lifts family mood and improves interactions . Good news for those who have struggled to maintain their New Year's diets - new research has revealed that eating dessert can really be good for you. The research, which explores everyday eating habits, has identified that an  occasional dessert lifts family mood and improves interactions. It also shows how children can benefit from family meals - they are more likely  to succeed in life, be healthier, do better at school, have higher self-esteem  and are less likely to develop eating disorders. Professor Geoffrey Beattie - who was once a psychologist for Big Brother - and advised on the study, said: 'We've known that sharing food has huge psychological, cultural and emotional significance. It's a critical part of our evolution and core to our everyday social world. 'This study identified that occasionally eating a dessert is producing a blip of happiness which is positively affecting families' mood, influencing how families are interacting with each other, and is creating happy memories.' A spokesman for Coppenrath & Wiese, who commissioned the research, said: 'I know that we all see eating dessert as routine and commonplace. 'But I'm sure we've all experienced the flicker of anticipation and excitement when we know that there is a treat on the way. 'We had no idea that the humble dessert could have such a psychological effect. It seems like the occasional dessert really could give British families a feel-good boost.' 1. It seems that many of us have got out of the habit of sitting down as a family and having a meal together. Discuss as a family why it would be a good thing. We all need time for each other away from our hectic lives. It may be inconvenient at first, but the positive benefits will make it really worthwhile. 2. Start small and realistically. One evening a week, a special occasion, with everyone helping to prepare, cook, setting the table, clearing up etc. Anticipate the event, keep it fun. Everyone then has a stake in having a good time, the responsibility does not fall on one individual. Eating a dessert is producing a 'blip'  of happiness which is positively affecting families' mood . 3. Try to avoid cooking several different meals. It is about sharing food. 4. The focus should be on the meal itself and the interaction, turn the TV, phones etc off. It is an opportunity to talk positively, don't use it as an opportunity to complain, accuse, challenge etc. If you have to do these, do them elsewhere. Use the time wisely. Reminisce as a family. Research suggests that what you talk about during the meal is one of the most important elements in promoting well-being and happiness. 5. Make it clear that this is something that the whole family should try. It may sound strange that something as basic as a family meal has to be approached in this way. But for many it will be a step into the unknown. Rediscover the joy of thinking as a family.","Psychologist Professor Geoffrey Beattie studied benefits of eating treats .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Canadian woman who suffered a brain hemorrhage just after Christmas is being kept on life support until her baby boy is big enough to be born. Robyn Benson, of Victoria, was 22 weeks pregnant when she collapsed at home after complaining of a piercing headache. There was nothing doctors could do to save her, but they are trying to keep her body alive for seven more weeks in the hope that the baby she was carrying will survive. In love: Dylan and Robyn Benson at their wedding last July. The couple had been high school sweethearts . For her husband, Dylan, the day the couple's longed-for baby boy is born will be filled with mixed emotions. 'On one hand, I can’t wait to meet my son and try, and give him the best life possible and try my hardest to be a great dad for him. On the other hand, I know that the day or the day after he is born will be the day that I have to say goodbye to Robyn,' Mr Benson told CBC. Although Mrs Benson has been declared brain dead, doctors are trying to keep her body alive for another seven weeks, so the baby can be safely delivered by cesarean section. 'Pretty much her body is doing everything but her brain isn't there anymore,' he said, adding that he recently felt the baby kicking for the first time. The couple, who had been high school sweethearts, married in July and were eagerly looking forward to the arrival of their first child. When the baby is born, Mr Benson plans to call him Iver - a name the couple had chosen before Mrs Benson's sudden illness. On the morning that she suffered the brain hemorrhage, Mrs Benson had woken with a piercing headache and asked her husband to go out and buy painkillers. When he returned, Mrs Benson was slumped unconscious in the bathroom. Tough times: Dylan Benson is keeping a vigil at the bedside of wife, Robyn, who is being kept on life support until their son is born . Hope: A scan shows baby Iver who is growing healthily despite his mother being declared brain dead . She was rushed to hospital but the following day, on December 29, she was declared brain dead. Mr Benson, who works for an IT company, has had to take time off work to keep a vigil at his wife's bedside. A You Caring fundraising site has been set up to help Mr Benson, who will be welcoming a baby into the world at the same time as burying his wife. Initially, the family hoped to raise $36,000 - enough to cover Mrs Benson's annual salary - but in an outpouring of support for Mr Benson and baby Iver, more than C$115,000 ($103,000) has been raised. In an update on Iver's progress, Mr Benson posted a message on the site saying how touched he was by the support. He added: 'We had another ultrasound today and things are still looking good for Iver, and Robyn is still holding on strong.' Money raised through the fund will be used to pay for baby supplies, daycare, housing and an education fund for Iver. 'It is very difficult to know that our son will grow up never meeting his wonderful mother, and that we will have to say our goodbyes to Robyn within hours of seeing Iver for the first time,' Mr Benson said.","Robyn Benson was 22 weeks pregnant when she had a brain hemorrhage .

Portable beach jails and extra police officers have been deployed to beaches in Florida to cope with the spring break invasion. The move comes after a huge spike in crime as thousands of teenagers hit the state’s Gulf Coast for the annual vacation. In the first week of spring break on Panama City Beach alone, already more than 210 arrests have been made for underage drinking, public intoxication, DUI, and one person has been charged with sexual assault. High police presence: More officers have been deployed to cope with the spring break invasion in Florida . Portable jails: The mobile unit on Panama City Beach allows officers to deal with offences quickly . One university student, Reny Jose, has been missing for more than a week after taking the hallucinogenic drug LCD at a beach house. And 21-year-old Rebecca Denardis, of Cary, was killed when the car she was driving was hit by a truck in a DUI-related crash. Panama City Beach Police Chief Drew Whitman said the portable jails had been brought in to allow officers to crack down on underage drinking and other offences without making the two-hour round-trip from the beach to the county jail. Annual holiday: Up to 300,000 students are expected to visit Panama City Beach during spring break . He said: 'The hotels have extra security staff, we have on our website information about how to enjoy spring break responsibly, and police walk the beaches and interact with the kids throughout the day to make sure that they are staying smart and to addresses situations before they occur.' About 300,000 college students are expected to converge on Panama City Beach during March. More than half this number will crowd Orlando's theme parks and attractions, with spring break the third busiest time of the year for the city.

"By . Jill Reilly . A herd of dairy cows nearly lifted the roof off their barn in central Germany when methane released by the animals caused an explosion. Police in Hesse state said in a statement that a static electric charge apparently triggered the detonation, and a spurt of flame, on Monday at a farm in Rasdorf. The roof was slightly damaged and one cow suffered light burns - no-one was hurt. A herd of dairy cows nearly lifted the roof off their barn in central Germany when methane released by the animals caused an explosion (file photo) Police say 90 cows are kept in the shed and it wasn't clear why quantities of methane had built up. Bovine belching and flatulence releases large quantities of the gas. An economist Portsmouth University revealed a herd of cows produces more greenhouse gas in a year than a family car produces to drive 3,000 miles. Dr Andy Thorpe said that 200 cows expel an annual amount of methane equivalent to the carbon dioxide emissions of a car burning 21,400 litres of petrol. Dr Thorpe added that while CO2 emissions have increased by 31 per cent in the past 250 years, methane has increased by 149 per cent over the same period. An economist revealed a herd of cows produces more greenhouse gas in a year than a family car produces to drive 3,000 miles . Methane has a greater warming effect than CO2 and a longer lifetime in the atmosphere. He said the gas is responsible for one fifth of global warming experienced since 1750. Between 55 per cent and 70 per cent of methane produced comes from man-made sources, mostly farming of animals such as cows, sheep and goats, which have an additional stomach and produce large amounts of methane as they digest food. Dr Thorpe said: 'Methane emission-growth, like CO2 growth, has been increasing exponentially in the developing world due to a rise in incomes leading to an increased demand for meat, and the ""hamburger connection"" where developing countries make a lucrative profit supplying meat to developed countries.' He explained that up to 75 per cent of animal methane emissions came from developing countries, with India and Brazil being the leading producers. Efforts are being made to reduce emissions, including providing different feed and using vaccinations, but they are in the early stages of research. Dr Thorpe, whose research is published in the journal Climatic Change, warned there could be problems with downsizing herds. A reduction in meat could lead to a 'disastrous' increase in demand for fish and cereals.","Static electric charge apparently triggered the detonation .

Carpenter, who has worked at Caboolture for 14 years, said the crash could have been caused by any number of things. 'One of the things one would expect would be an engine failure, but the engine was delivering power on touch down,"" he said. 'So it's something mechanical I would say ... or the pilot could have blacked out – any number of scenarios; it's a bit like MH370 at the moment, we just don't know.'

"By . Lizzie Parry . A family from Florida have been told they must get rid of their pet pot-bellied pig or risk losing their home, after council bosses referred to 'outdated' rules. David Kirkman and his wife Laura have been told keeping Buttercup, their 250lbs pet, is in breach of a Pensacola city council regulation, which bans 'livestock' from within the city boundaries. The couple, along with their two children, nine-year-old Molly and Butch, seven, have argued Buttercup is a pet and should not be classed as livestock. The Kirkman family from Pensacola in Florida have been told they must get rid of their pet pot-bellied pig Buttercup, pictured with Molly Kirkman, nine and her seven-year-old brother Butch, or risk losing their home . The family raised the two-year-old pot-bellied pig from the age of five weeks old, and she sleeps along with the family dog, Muck, in the children's bedrooms. But the city council have given the family until May to get rid of Buttercup or risk losing their home. The Pensacola News Journal reported the council received an anonymous tip that the Kirkmans were keeping a pig on their property, in December. The council rule states, 'It shall be unlawful to keep any horse, mule, donkey, goat, sheep, hogs and cattle in any stable, shed, pen or enclosure within city limits.' Mrs Kirkman said the ordinance or regulation refers to 'hogs' in the plural, and despite her size she is still 'just one pig'. 'We're not going to eat her and we're not going to sell her,' said Molly Kirkman, nine. 'She doesn't live on a farm. She sleeps in my room.' Pensacola city council received an anonymous tip in December telling them that the Kirkmans were keeping a pig on their property. A council regulation bans residents from keeping 'livestock' within the city boundaries . David Kirkman, pictured with this wife Laura, children Molly and Butch and Buttercup, says the two-year-old pot-bellied pig is their family pet and should not be classed as livestock . The family has taken their case to council member Sherri Myers, who has agreed to backed their cause. Ms Myers branded the rules 'pretty outdated', adding she is working to submit a council agenda item that would exclude pot-bellied pigs from the definition of livestock. She said they should be classified as domestic animals. Ms Myers said she recently discovered a pot-bellied pig wandering in her neighbourhood. She said: 'The whole neighborhood was excited that there was a pot-bellied pig around.' The mystery was solved when Ms Myers and her neighbours learned a friend was pet-sitting the pig, which had escaped. The family have taken their case up with council member Sherri Myers, who branded the rule 'outdated'. She said she is drafting a council agenda to exclude pot-bellied pig from the definition of livestock . 'It was kind of exciting for our neighborhood,' Ms Myers added. The Kirkmans said they receive the same excited response from people who meet Buttercup. 'She's not noisy. She's not smelly, she's not trouble to anyone,' Mrs Kirkman said. 'Most people love her. She's an attraction around here.' But she added, the saga has been a good learning curve for her children, teaching them how to tackle a problem head on. 'They're learning how to handle a problem,' Mrs Kirkman said. 'They're learning to do things the right way, and to show respect while they're doing it.'","David Kirkman and his wife Laura have been told to get rid of their pet pig .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Philadelphia Eagles star wide receiver DeSean Jackson has been cut from the team over alleged ties to the notorious Crips street gang members implicated in multiple murders, according to a new report. Jackson, 27, was due more than $10million for the upcoming season, but a report citing unnamed sources says the move was hardly a salary cap dump, and more a preemptive strike for a team looking to avoid the next Aaron Hernandez. The shock announcement came Friday less than an hour after the report linked the wideout to known gang-bangers Theron Shakir and Marques Binnes, as well as explaining how even the name of his record label aligns with Crips culture. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Superstar: Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver DeSean Jackson (10) reaches for a pass as New York Giants cornerback Corey Webster (23) defends during a game last season. Jackson was cut Friday by the team over alleged gang ties, according to a report . The Los Angeles native set career highs with 83 receptions for 1,332 yards and nine touchdowns en route to his third Pro Bowl, but the team reportedly became weary of him flashing gang signs both on the field during games and in social media posts. ‘They are concerned about having him around the younger players,’ a team source told the paper. Jackson and his agent have denied any ties to the murderous gang despite the Star-Ledger report. The six year veteran was the subject of rampant trade rumors for the past several weeks, but the Eagles decided to instead give him his outright release, according to a team statement. ‘After careful consideration this off-season, Eagles decide to part ways with DeSean Jackson. The team informed him of his release today.’ The team was aware of Jackson’s association with the two men, implicated in multiple murders since 2010, according to the report. But the details revealed Friday by the paper likely forced its hand – especially with NFL teams weary of ex-Patriot Aaron Hernandez suspected in as many as three murders, as well as drug and arms trafficking and gang activity. Gang-involved friends: Jackson (far right) pictured with Shakir (center right) shortly after his release from prison. Shakir is still wearing his LA County Jail t-shirt in this shot posted to Instagram . Shakir and Binns were charged in the Dec 29, 2010 execution of a 14-year-old boy who flashed a rival gang sign at them while riding his bike through crime-ridden South Los Angeles. The two men were accused by police of shooting the young boy multiple times, but Jackson stood by him and even posted pictures of them together while he was detained, the Star-Ledger noted. Shakir is signed to Jackson-owned Jaccpot Records under the name ‘T-Ron.’ Jackson was not ever named a suspect in the killing, but was questioned by police. An LAPD spokesperson told the paper the player was ‘cooperative at the time,’ and in no way even suspected of having anything to do with the killing. Charges against Shakir were eventually dropped after he sat in prison for one year awaiting trial. Jackson, Shakir and two other men were seen in a photo posted to Instagram soon after his release. Shakir still had on his LA County Jail shirt while Jackson’s arm was around him. Shakir was still wearing a prison-issued t-shirt. Binns was convicted of murder and sentenced to 15 years to life in prison, records showed. 'Free Trezzy': jackson (center) posted this picture to Instagram with a caption calling for Shakir's release while he sat in jail awaiting trial on charges he gunned down a 14-year-old boy . Those posts and the police questioning didn’t deter the Eagles from signing the star player to a five-year, $48.5million contract extension. About a year after this incident, another troubling gang-affiliated murder occurred in a building owned or leased by a Jackson relative, police told the Star-Ledger. Documents including a gun permit and a car title were found in the building where the killing occurred, but Jackson was not tied to the crime. The Jaccpot record label, at which Shakir is a signed artist, is said to be spelled in Crips-style – spelling it as Jackpot would be against gang rules since ‘ck’ in any use stands for Crip Killer, an expert told the paper. Jackson has publicly defended the name of the label by saying the ‘jackpot.com’ domain was previously taken. 'Rolling 60's': Jackson has been photographed many times flashing the contorted C signal used by members of a local Crips gang from the Crenshaw neighborhood he grew up in - he even flashed the supposed gang sign at Washington Redskins player DeAngelo Hall on national television last season . Snoop Dogg, a hip hop artist long-known to make references to the Crips in his music, released a song on Jaccpot with Jackson in a music video flashing hand signals similar to the gang signs flashed by the Rolling 60’s neighborhood Crips, a gang expert told Larry Brown Sports. Jackson also flashed the same ‘contorted c’ hand signal at the Washington Redskins’ DeAngelo Hall after making a big catch during a game early last season – on national television. ‘You don't want to see anybody throwing up gang signs like he did in the Redskins game last year,’ an LAPD gang expert told the Star-Ledger. ‘Those were neighborhood Crip gang signs and he flashed them during a game,’ the expert continued. ‘He may not be affiliated with the gang, but they don't [ordinarily] take kindly to those not in the gang throwing up those gang signs.’ The boisterous receiver then wrote ‘10mode 1-0 to start .. Keep Rollin,’ in an Instagram post after the game. ‘DeSean Jackson is not a gang member,’ EAG Management CEO and founder Denise White, Jackson’s agent, told the paper. ‘He’s far, far from it.’ Jackson was not made available for comment, but did offer the following statement posted to Facebook by ESPN reporter Adam Shefter. ‘I would like to make it very clear that I am not and never have been part of any gang,’ said the embattled footballer. ‘I am not a gang member and to speculate and assume that I am involved in such activity off the field is reckless and irresponsible.’ Players have had mostly negative reaction to both the report and the release. ‘Something isn't right with this DeSean/Eagles situation. Doubt it had anything to do with gang stuff,’ tweeted New York Giants linebacker Spencer Paysinger. ‘It's hard to believe some people are trying to draw a connection between [Jackson] and Aaron Hernandez,’ former Eagles running back Brian Westbrook tweeted. Jackson’s former coach at Crenshaw High School also defended him, saying there was never any inclination of gang activity and even chalked his rowdy behaviour up to wanting to play up a tough image for the music label. Jackson has never been convicted of any crime outside of a guilty plea in April 2010 to a charge of disturbing the peace.","The Pro Bowl wideout has been accused of either belonging to or socializes with members of the violent gang .

"By . Joel Christie . An Orlando couple have gone public with some 'disturbing' news they discovered from their five-year-old daughter, who told them she was instructed by a teacher that 'praying is not good' when she went to give thanks for her food. Marcos and Kathy Perez said they were so shocked to learn of the incident they started filming for their little girl's confession on Marcos' iPhone. The kindergartener's story was posted on YouTube and, as reported by The Blaze, has generated a groundswell of interest. 'I was at school, and I got my lunch, and I was about to pray and say something to Jesus,' their daughter said. Scroll down for video . 'Not good': A video of the little girl, from Orlando, explaining what her lunch teacher said to her has created quite a stir . The -five-year-old demonstrates how she prays. It is alleged that a teacher at her school told her she is not allowed to pray . Marcos Perez is seen here in a Facebook photo with his daughter . Then this shocker: 'My lunch teacher told me ... you're not allowed to pray.' According to the girl's description, the staff member in question is female. Marcos Perez told TheBlaze on Friday that the exchange occurred the week of March 10 at a public school near their Orlando-area home. Perez said he's not prepared to release any more identifying facts — including his daughter's first name — until the incident has shaken out. The parents said they are incredibly proud of their daughter, who stood up for herself by saying 'it's good to pray'. The teacher then allegedly came back with: 'It's not good'.' 'It is good,' the girl insisted. The toddler then said when she went to pray for a second time, she was again caught. 'No American should ever experience having their right to pray taken away,' he told TheBlaze. Perez — vice president of sales at Charisma House, a Christian book publisher — emailed and called the principal of his daughter's school, who in turn checked into the incident. 'As expected, the staff denied everything,' Perez said. For now the Perezes are attempting to figure out he identity of the staff member in question by looking at photos online — and strongly considering homeschooling. 'We're concerned about Common Core,' Perez said, adding that their daughter 'doesn’t need to be exposed to that and get harassed because of her faith.' The little girl, who said a teacher told her praying 'is not good', is seen here with her mother, Kathy Perez . Marcos Perez says he awaiting answers from his daughters school over the incident . Dear — . I'm am writing this email in shock and disbelief. Today, our daughter —, a kindergarten student at —, told us that during a recent lunch period at school, a staff person at (school name) saw her praying for her food — stopped her — and told her that she could not pray. Our daughter responded by saying 'but it's good to pray,' and she said the staff person said 'it's not good.' I asked her, 'Did she just say 'No' or did she say ‘it's not good? To which she responded with the same face and imitation of the staff person that said 'it's not good'. I asked her what she did next, and she said she tried praying but she couldn't because 'they caught me again'. At this point, we affirmed her courageous attempt to stand up for her beliefs and we encouraged her to ensure she understood that according to our views and our family values – she did nothing wrong. To say this was disturbing is a gross understatement. What is the school's position on this? I look forward to your prompt reply. Sincerely, . Marcos Perez . Mr. Perez, I received your email and your voice message this morning. I have spoken to each adult who was in the lunchroom at the time that your daughter had lunch yesterday.  None of them recall having this conversation with your daughter. Please know that students are permitted to pray during school. I will remind all staff members of this. Dear — . Thank you for your response. I'm pleased to know this is not a policy or position of the school. However, please note that this did not happen yesterday. As a matter of fact, my daughter was not at school yesterday as she is home with a stomach bug. This actually happened the week prior to Spring break, the week of March 10.  She said something to my parents in passing on Friday, March 14 but we did not sit down and talk to her about it until last night in full detail. So you are aware, during our discussion last night, I decided to whip out my iPhone and record my daughters story. I posted that video on social media for friends, family and other concerned parents to see what my daughter experienced. My 5-year old should not feel conflicted about prayer with respect to trying to follow rules or authority. We remain speechless that our daughter had to experience from an individual with an agenda. Please click on the following link so you can see for yourself. There are two issues here. The first is the violation of my daughter's right to pray during lunch by the individual who said this to her and prevented her from praying. The second is the school's position on this, which is now settled and I'm clear on – and satisfied with. But the first issue — the violation of my daughters right to pray — by the rogue individual in authority at that time, is still a major concern. Are the same staff in the lunch room every day? Could there have been someone else in her lunch period the week of March 10? Thanks again for your help with this. Marcos . Mr.  Perez, . Typically the same staff members are in the cafeteria each day. I checked with any possible person who may have been there, as well our food service personnel. No one recalls having this conversation with your daughter the week prior to spring break or ever. Again, I will reiterate to the entire staff, that students are permitted to pray. The Perez family said they intend to get to the bottom of the matter as quickly as possible.","Orlando parents Marcos and Kathy Perez were shocked when their five-year-old daughter came home and said she had been told not to pray at school .

"By . Jill Reilly . A French court has rejected a residency appeal by a Roma 15-year-old whose arrest in front of her schoolmates and expulsion to Kosovo sparked national protests. Leonarda Dibrani was detained in October as she got off a bus from a school trip, sparking rowdy protests in Paris and other cities. A court in the eastern French city of Besancon threw out the family's request to return to France, ruling that their expulsion did not contradict the country's international commitments to respect family and children's rights. A French court has rejected the appeal for the residency for the deported Roma family. Leonarda Dibrani, who had lived in France for about five years, was taken off a bus by police during a school outing . It noted Mr. Dibrani's 'lack of prospects for economic and social assimilation in France' and Mrs. Dibrani's 'lack ... of any assimilation into French society.' The girl, Leonarda Dibrani, received the news in the family's shelter house in Kosovo's town of Mitrovica. She said: 'My future came to an end today.' 'For me this is a nightmare,' she said. 'I have taken this very badly. I try to be courageous but inside it hurts.' Dzemile Dibrani, the mother of Leonarda Dibrani, sits alongside her baby daughter Medina after the ruling by a French court . In June, the regional administration had ordered the family to leave France and return to their father's native Kosovo. The family could appeal, but court spokeswoman Leila Azizi said it's unclear whether they will do so. The teenager was detained in front of her classmates and expelled as an illegal immigrant. While such expulsions occur regularly as France tries to stem illegal immigration, the circumstances of the arrest - in front of Leonarda's classmates and teachers - shocked many. Following pressure from the far left and members of his own party, Socialist President Francois Hollande invited Leonarda to return, but said the rest of the family could not come with her. She refused to return alone. The family as they anxiously waited for news. Leonarda Dibrani, was taken off a bus in October 2013, sparking protest in France . While such expulsions occur regularly as France tries to stem illegal immigration, the circumstances of the arrest - in front of Leonarda's classmates and teachers - shocked many . The head of the family, Reshat Dibrani, admitted he lied in his asylum application when he said the entire family fled Kosovo, where they were persecuted for being Roma . 'We have been thrown away here like dogs,' said Leonarda's mother, Dzemila Dibrani. Leonarda Dibrani, and most of her siblings, were born in Italy but do not have Italian citizenship. The head of the family, Reshat Dibrani, admitted he lied in his asylum application when he said the entire family fled Kosovo, where they were persecuted for being Roma. The father is the only member of the family who is a Kosovo citizen. The court said the regional administration should not be held accountable for the fact that the Dibranis were not actually Kosovar and had lived in Italy before coming to France, since the Dibranis didn't tell anyone that. Kosovo authorities are currently supporting the family.","Court in eastern French city of Besancon threw out family's request .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . The Navy said farewell Friday to the USS Miami, the nuclear-powered submarine whose service was cut short when a shipyard employee trying to get out of work set it on fire, causing $700 million in damage. The somber deactivation ceremony at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard marked the beginning of an inglorious end: Next year, the submarine will be towed to the West Coast to be cut up for scrap metal. Rear Adm. Ken Perry, commander of the submarine Group Two in Groton, Conn., where the sub was based, acknowledged the disappointment over its premature retirement but told the crowd they were there to celebrate Miami and its crew members for nearly 24 years of service. Goodbye: Commander Rolf Spelker, left, receives the commission pennant at the decommissioning ceremony for the fire-damaged USS Miami nuclear submarine at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Friday, March 28, 2014, in Kittery, Maine . In better times: The USS Miami SSN 755, homeported in Groton, Conn., arrives in port in 2004 in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. 'This is a tribute,' he said. 'This is a celebration of the ship's performance and the superb contributions to the nation's defense and this is how we're going to treat it. So I expect to see some smiles out there.' Perry praised the ship's performance over more than a dozen deployments that included clandestine undersea warfare missions and back-to-back deployments in which it fired cruise missiles in Iraq and in Serbia, earning the nickname 'Big Gun.' The audience included crew members and their families and seven former Miami commanding officers, including retired Capt. Tom Mader, the sub's first skipper. At the end of the ceremony, the crew filed out of the auditorium after its top enlisted sailor, Chief Tyrus Rock, led them in a cheer, shouting out the first part of the ship's motto, 'No free rides!' The crew finished by responding, 'Everybody rows!' Sending off: Rear Admiral Ken Perry arrives at the decommissioning ceremony for the fire-damaged USS Miami nuclear submarine at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Friday, March 28, 2014, in Kittery, Maine . Cmdr. Rolf Spelker, the Miami crew's current leader, said he came to Portsmouth thinking his assignment was to return the ship for service. 'They are no doubt disappointed and saddened that they can't take the ship out to sea,' he said of his crew. 'They have gone through the tidal wave of emotion.' After the fire, the Navy originally intended to return the ship to the fleet next year after extensive repairs. But it decided to scrap the submarine when estimated repair costs grew substantially above a $450 million estimate. Instead, shipyard workers will remove nuclear fuel and ship it to a federal repository in Idaho. They will make enough repairs so that the submarine can be towed to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Washington state, where it will be cut up for scrap. The estimated cost of the sub's inactivation is $54 million. Final farewell: A sailor rings a bell at the conclusion of the  decommissioning ceremony . The Los Angeles-class submarine was damaged at the hands of a shipyard worker who set a fire in May 2012 while the submarine was undergoing a 20-month overhaul. Seeking an excuse to leave work early, Casey James Fury set fire to a box of rags on a bunk, and the blaze quickly spread throughout the forward compartments. Fury pleaded guilty and is serving a 17-year sentence in federal prison. It took 12 hours and the efforts of more than 100 firefighters to save the vessel. The fire severely damaged living quarters, the command and control center and a torpedo room, but it did not reach the nuclear propulsion components at the sub's rear. Seven people were hurt dousing the flames. The Navy launched a series of investigations after the fire that led to recommendations, including installation of temporary automatic fire detection systems while submarines and other vessels are being repaired or overhauled. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","The USS Miami was damaged beyond repair in the May 2012 fire accidentally set by a worker trying to leave for the day .

"By . Associated Press . Beneath the strings of red paper lanterns and narrow alleyways of the nation's oldest Chinatown in San Francisco,  lies a sinister underworld, according to an FBI criminal complaint that has stunned even those familiar with the neighborhood's history of gambling houses, opium dens and occasional gangland-style murders. The federal charges, which allege a California lawmaker accepted money and campaign donations in exchange for providing official favors and helping broker an arms deal, cast harsh light on Chinatown's tight-knit network of fraternal organizations and one of its most shadowy characters, Raymond 'Shrimp Boy' Chow, who appeared in federal court on Friday in handcuffs and shackles. Investigators say Chow is the leader — the dragonhead — of one of the most powerful Asian gangs in North America. Chow's gang is said to have lured state Sen. Leland Yee into its clutches through money and campaign contributions in exchange for legislative help, as Yee sought to build his campaign coffers to run for California secretary of state. Gang leader: Raymond 'Shrimp Boy' Chow, is seen here posing for a portrait in San Francisco in July 2007. He was arrested this week in a major FBI sting . California Sen. Leland Yee, D-San Francisco, is seen here as he leaves the San Francisco Federal Building on  Wednesday after the bust . In court Friday, Assistant Public Defender Elizabeth Falk told a judge that Chow would have to find other legal representation. She cited potential conflicts of interest involving previous cases, but did not elaborate. Chow did not enter a plea, and the hearing was continued until Monday. Born in Hong Kong in 1960, Chow came to the United States at 16 and was reportedly nicknamed 'Shrimp Boy' by his grandmother, in part due to his small stature. After dropping out of high school, Chow rose within the ranks of the local Hop Sing Tong gang after he and his crew survived a 1977 shooting at a Chinatown restaurant that left five dead and about a dozen people injured. Chow then spent a few years inside San Quentin Prison for a robbery conviction, and after his release, he started working with the Hong Kong-based Wo Hop To triad, one of numerous Chinese underground societies linked to organized crime. how has admitted that as a gang leader, he ran prostitution rings, smuggled drugs and extorted thousands of dollars from business owners in the 1980s. Mr. Shrimp Boy is fond of sharing photos of himself - including this picture of himself in a hot tub . Chow, who is accused of money laundering among a host of other crimes, is also a snappy dresser who is a fan of three piece suits and pocket squares . 'He was given like an unofficial position of being a leader, but to say he was sophisticated, no. He was more like a forceful brute,' said Ignatius Chinn, a former California Department of Justice agent who spent years investigating Chow in the early 1990s. 'If he didn't get his way, he would just beat the door down and that was how we put cases on him. Although he ultimately was convicted of gun charges and sentenced to 25 years to life in the 1990s, Chow cut a deal to win release and returned to Chinatown several years ago, pledging to stay straight. His work with at-risk youth soon won accolades from prominent politicians. But the complaint alleges that Chow used his position as the dragonhead of the Ghee Kung Tong to launder money, receive and transport stolen property and traffic in contraband cigarettes during a FBI sting. Shrimp Boy, back center, appears here in a courtroom sketch with some of his cohorts on Wednesday . Shrimp Boy always wears tradition clothes sometimes. And in the picture at left, he posed up with former San Francisco Mayor and current Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom . Longtime residents and observers said the startling allegations revealed the continued presence of organized crime in the popular tourist attraction and home to one of the largest Chinese communities outside Asia. 'Chinatown is a very safe place and usually the crime you hear about there is just robberies and people being taken advantage of,' said Joseph Leung, editor for the San Francisco edition of The Sing Tao Daily, the largest circulation Chinese newspaper in the U.S. 'That's why this is all so shocking.' The pre-dawn FBI raid Wednesday at the Ghee Kung Tong's office, next to a massage parlor and across from a benevolent society where elderly people play mahjong, also brought into focus its centuries-old history. The tong was founded in the late 1880s to support immigrants from Hong Kong and elsewhere in the Pearl Delta region. Further investigation: An FBI carries out boxes of evidence following a search of a Chinatown fraternal organization on Wednesday . Together: This photo taken August 11, 2013, shows state Senator Yee,  left, and Chow, right, at the a Chinese restaurant grand opening ceremony in Daly City, California .

Amid morning rain showers on Wednesday, . federal agents and fire crews stormed the building armed with a circular . saw and Jaws of Life to crack a safe that authorities say was at least a . century old. The . organization is among dozens of active tongs, or family associations, in . Chinatown, and Chow assumed control when its former president, Allen . Leung, was shot to death by a masked gunman at his import-export store . in 2006, said David Lee, director of the Chinese American Voters . Education Committee. ""He . kind of became like a gangster celebrity. He was on parole, he had an . ankle bracelet and he became a fixture at political events for a while,"" said Lee, who also teaches political science at San Francisco State . University. The 137-page . complaint, whose many twists are reminiscent of American Hustle, does . not reveal whether Yee had any connection to Chow before the FBI got . involved. Yee, a progressive . Democrat born in China, built his political fortune partly through . Chinatown connections and had never lost a race until his failed bid for . San Francisco mayor in 2011.

"By . Alfonso Serrano F. UPDATED: . 17:58 EST, 5 March 2012 . Two filmmakers are set to release a documentary demonstrating their attempt to secure an earmark from Congress for a museum dedicated to wasteful government spending. Ellen and Jim Hubbard of Nevada plan to release Museum of Government Waste later this year to showcase the foolishness of ‘pork barrel’ projects Congress chooses to fund with taxpayer dollars. The filmmakers take viewers through their five-year journey to obtain public funds by documenting their meetings with members of Congress and several lobbyists. Pork barrel project: A documentary to be released later this year will detail how a couple attempted to secure funding for a Museum of Government Waste . They embarked on their quest knowing it was highly unlikely they would obtain the earmark. After a series of frustrating meetings with members of Congress, the filmmakers altered their tactics a bit and mentioned that a wealthy backer had come on board to support the film. 'And once you tell them about a wealthy backer, it was weird,' Ellen Hubbard told The Daily Caller. 'All of them acted the same way. The conversation shifted from ""what’s your earmark"" to ""how can we get this done"". It was eye opening.' In order to not raise any eyebrows in the halls of Congress, the filmmaking duo used hidden cameras. But you will have to watch the film to find out if they were ultimately successful in their crusade. Ms Hubbard won’t say whether they managed to secure the earmark. 'I’m not going to tell you because that’s really the point of watching the film,' she told the site. The couple also secured private money for the project and plan to follow up the film’s release by opening an actual Museum of Government Waste later this year, most probably in Washington DC. The museum will be operated by David Williams of the Taxpayers Protection Alliance. He also helped fund the film. 'Why not have a space in Washington DC where we could have pictures of members of Congress - a hall of shame,' Mr Williams said to The Daily Caller. 'We could have individual items. We could have tea pots to represent the tea pot museum and have rotating exhibits.' Radio talk show personality Greg Knapp, a friend of the Hubbards, helped them with their project and also stars in the film. Congress is notorious for spending public money on questionable pet projects, including $2.5 million in 2010 for potato breeding research programs; $1.79 million in 2008 for pig odor research in Iowa; and $50 million in 2004 for an indoor rainforest in Coralville, Iowa.","Filmmakers used hidden cameras to go undetected in Congress .

"By . Leon Watson . A carer has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a 73-year-old man was found dead at a nursing home for dementia sufferers. The woman, 63, was detained by detectives investigating the patient's death at the Ascot Nursing Home in Berkshire after police were called on Thursday. The suspect, from nearby Bracknell, was then taken in for questioning on suspicion of murder but released on conditional police bail later on Friday. The Ascot Nursing Home in Ascot, Berkshire, where a 63-year-old carer has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a 73-year-old man who was a patient there . Sources said that it was believed she worked at the leafy Ascot Nursing Home which caters for up to 75 patients suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Care for individuals costs up to £1,300 a week. The care home, set in its own well-tended grounds and very close to Ascot racecourse, is privately run and has mostly single ground floor rooms which patients are encouraged to decorate with their own ornaments and belongings. Although secure with alarms on all outer doors, there are numerous secluded areas in the grounds where patients can sit and read or enjoy the sunshine. The police spokesman said although the man died on Saturday, March 22, police were not called to the nursing home until last Thursday. A post mortem examination was due to be carried out at a hospital mortuary tomorrow afternoon. A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: 'Officers have attended the nursing home since Thursday as part of the investigation. The care home, set in its own well-tended grounds and very close to Ascot racecourse, is privately run . 'The deceased man is not expected to be identified until Monday evening. We will not discuss the employment of the woman arrested or give any other details at present. 'All I can say is that a 63-year-old woman from Bracknell was arrested on suspicion of murder at the nursing home and that she has been released on bail pending further inquiries.' The Care Quality Commission, which oversees private nursing homes, confirmed on its website that it was investigating the Ascot Nursing Home. It said: 'We have received information that has led us to carry out an inspection of Ascot Nursing Home. We will publish a report when our check is complete.' The commission did not indicate whether the 'information' related to the murder inquiry. No-one from the care home's management team was available to comment today. A nurse who answered the door at the Ascot Nursing Home said that staff knew very little about the death or police investigation. 'We don't know anything,' said the nurse. 'We are just coming to work as normal. There is no one from management here today.' Asked if the 63-year-old woman arrested and bailed on suspicion of murder would be coming back to work, she said: 'I don't know. 'There are confidentiality issues involved. I don't know what is going on. We only know what the management has told us.'","Officers called to Ascot Nursing Home in Berks on Thursday .

"By . Andy Gardner . A detective who says she was made a scapegoat for a mishandled investigation into the murder of a teenage girl is suing police for up to £500,000 in the High Court. Jan Beasant was forced to quit her job after Lancashire police failed to bring anyone to justice over the disappearance of  14-year-old Charlene Downes, who was groomed by a child sex gang linked to takeaway food shops in Blackpool. The teenager’s body has never been found. Jan Beasant, 48, is suing Lancashire police for up to £500,000 in the High Court, saying she was made a scapegoat for a mishandled murder investigation . Police believed Charlene Downes, 14, was groomed by a child sex gang linked to takeaway food shops in Blackpool . Two men were charged with murder, but former Detective Sergeant Beasant was blamed for the collapse of the case because of the poor quality of surveillance tapes that formed a crucial part of the evidence. Ms Beasant, 48, won an appeal against a disciplinary hearing ruling that her conduct in the investigation fell below the standard expected. Her lawyers say Lancashire police ‘knowingly or with reckless indifference’ accused her of a lack of integrity. Police believed Charlene was a member of a group of young girls who had sex with older men in return for gifts before she vanished in 2003. When a supergrass named two men allegedly involved in Charlene’s murder, they were secretly bugged. DS Beasant listened to the tapes and spent two years writing up their conversations. But the Crown Prosecution Service said there were  ‘grave doubts’ over the quality of the recordings and accuracy of transcripts.

"By . Dan Bloom . E-fit: How Italy's top Mafia boss Matteo Messina Denaro could look after a fresh sighting . Police have revealed a new e-fit of Italy's most wanted Mafia boss after an informant saw him in hiding - where he has been for 21 years. Convicted murderer Matteo Messina Denaro, now 51, was last seen at a beach resort in 1993 and is said to have boasted of killing enough people to fill a cemetery. The new image has emerged just three months after police swooped on the town where Messina Denaro grew up in Sicily and arrested his sister, cousin and nephew. Police claim the fugitive, nicknamed Diabolik after an Italian comic book master villain, still runs many of the Mafia's rackets in Sicily around the small town of Castelventrano where he grew up. The son of a Mafia boss, he is alleged to have used guns aged 14 and committed murder at 18 but could now be blind in one eye thanks to a retina disease, Italian news agency Ansa reported. His disappearance from a resort in Tuscany two decades ago came after the so-called 'boss of bosses' Salvatore 'The Beast' Riina was given life in jail for ordering bomb attacks on two state prosecutors. Police say he was involved in five car bomb attacks in Florence, Milan and Rome which rocked the country over the summer of 1993, leaving 10 people dead, injuring 93 and damaging Florence's Uffizi Gallery, which includes such treasures as Sandro Botticelli's Birth of Venus. Rare sightings of Denaro came in the mid-1990s at an eye specialist in Barcelona, Spain, where he concealed his identity by omitting his second surname - which translates as 'money'. Over the years, as many other Mafia bosses were captured or killed, Denaro moved up police rankings to claim the spot of the nation's most wanted man. In 2002, he was jailed for life in his absence for murder, Mafia association and other crimes. The new images are notable because despite Denaro's eye problems, one of the photo-fits does not picture him wearing glasses. Age: The e-fit (left) of the playboy don (right) suggests he is heavier-set than before with a receding hairline . Arch-villain: The Mafia boss is nicknamed Diabolik after the comic book criminal of the same name, pictured . New descriptions of him suggest he is taller and heavier-set than thought before, with a receding hairline and hair which remains remarkably dark for his 51 years. The new image is the first in recent history to be based on an actual sighting, instead of computerised age progressions which were modelled on his driver's licence. Police have never captured an image of Denaro on CCTV, despite his reputation as a playboy with a love of sports cars and designer watches. Yet investigators believe he has not strayed far from his home town, which has a population of just 30,000. A police statement in December said the Castelvetrano crime clan had 'an almost monopolistic control of the construction sector'. One project the Mafia group is said to have infiltrated was the building of a wind farm to generate electricity for public roads and restaurants. Wanted: Previous computerised images of Denaro, such as this one, have not been based on actual sightings and have only 'aged' images which police already had. He is Italy's most wanted man . Police commander Mario Parente said his team was closer than ever before to Denaro in December after the arrest of 30 people, including his sister. Patrizia Messina Denaro was led away to a police car at 3am after investigators claimed wire taps showed she had been in contact with her fugitive brother, and played a key role in transmitting his directives to other mobsters. Prosecutor Teresa Principato told a press conference his 'sister can carry out a role, traditionally held by males. But this doesn't mean that men weren't capable of taking Matteo Messina Denaro's place'. Mario Messina Denaro, the fugitive's cousin, and Francesco Guttaduro, his nephew, were also among those arrested. Police said in December that they had more suspects lined up, but were choosing to follow them covertly rather than arrest them and destroy a possible channel to Denaro's whereabouts.

Stacey Grant was with her family in Las Vegas when her mother received a call from police that their home in Fontana, California had been burglarized. In astonishing luck, police officers happened to be surveilling the area at the time of the break in on Tuesday and were able to stop and arrest Grant's acquaintance Michael Baston, 21, and two other men, Philip McKnight, 32, and Tyrone Gibson, 20.

With friends like these: Stacey Grant, left, was stunned when her Facebook friend Michael Baston, right, allegedly stole from her family's home after she posted on the site that she was on vacation . Distraught: Grant said learning her 'friend' had broken in while she was away was 'hurtful' Grant told NBC Los Angeles that she regularly shared her whereabouts with her Facebook friends and had excitedly written, 'Just made it to Las Vegas with my family' on Monday. She said that Baston texted her asking how long her family was away for and how the trip was going, and she said that she innocently believed they were just catching up. But within hours of their text conversation, police . called the family to let them know their home had been burglarized by a group of men. 'It was hurtful,' Grant said. 'My whole room was trashed, there were clothes everywhere. My bed was gone.' Letting the world know: After Grant made this Facebook post, Baston texted to ask when she was back . Scene: Police happened to be in the area and saw the three men carrying furniture from the house . Authorities said that the brazen trio had parked a U-Haul truck outside the home and filled it up items, including flat screen televisions and furniture. Neighbors, who did not know the family was on vacation, told KTLA that they had assumed the men were relatives of the homeowners. But officers were in the area, which had been hit with a spate of burglaries in recent weeks. They spotted the men loading up the van and when they approached them, one of the suspects ran off, confirming their suspicions, KTLA reported. All three men were arrested on suspicion . of burglary, possession of stolen property and conspiracy, and the family returned from their trip immediately. Helping hands: Phillip McKnight, 32, (left) and Tyrone Gibson, 20, (right) were also arrested for burglary .

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . Big move: Lauren Bush Lauren and her husband David have been revealed as the buyers of Annie Leibovitz's cut-price New York City home . Lauren Bush Lauren and her husband David have been revealed to be the buyers of Annie Leibovitz's cut-price New York City home. The celebrated photographer put her 10,200-square-foot, seven-bedroom, 13-fireplace abode on the market in December 2012 for a cool $33million but was forced to reduce the price to $28.5million after no buyers came forward. It was listed as 'sold' last month, and now the New York Post reports that Lauren Bush Lauren, the niece of former President George W. Bush, and her spouse, David Lauren, the son of fashion mogul Ralph, are the purchasers. The couple, who married in the fall of 2011, live just a stone's throw away from the massive West Village townhouse, making the moving process a little easier. Their new marital home, located at 755 Greenwich Street, consists of three separate townhouses which Ms Leibovitz bought for $6.1million and gut-renovated. She used one for living, one for office space and one as guest quarters. The red brick buildings, which Ms Leibovitz began assembling in 2002, date back to the 1830s, and are surrounded by a slate patio and private courtyard garden. Inside the main home, a key feature is Ms Leibovitz's wide-plank wood floors, which are offset by high ceilings. There is also a formal dining room and chef's kitchen. The building that includes a photography studio also features a large reception room. Photographers lair: Ms Leibovitz was forced to cut the price of her West Village home, which she lived in for a decade, by $4million to $29million after no buyers came forward . Million dollar mansion: The compound is composed of three separate townhouses - one for living, one for office  space and one as guest quarters . Listing . broker Paula Del Nunzio, of Brown Harris Stevens, previously said of . the property: 'It's very rare to have something like this. She created . it.' She revealed that Ms Leibovitz was selling up because she wanted to move uptown to be closer to the school of her three daughters - Sarah, who was born in 2001, and her twin girls, Susan and Samuelle, who were born to a surrogate mother in 2005. Greek Revival style: The brick buildings date back to the 1830s, and include 13 fireplaces in all, with a combined total of more than 10,200 square feet . Labor of love: Ms Leibovitz, 63, created the compound after she purchased all three buildings on the corner of Greenwich Street in Manhattan for $6.1million, and gut-renovated all three homes . Although many speculated that the famed snapper was looking to satisfy her debt problems. In 2009 she was sued over a dispute over the terms of a loan repayment that involved her townhouses and photo archives, which creditors claimed she had put up as collateral, and saw her narrowly miss having to file for bankruptcy. She had borrowed $15.5million after experiencing financial challenges due to the then recent loss of her father, her mother, and her long-time partner, Susan Sontag, as well as the addition of twins to her family, and the controversial renovation of the three West Village properties. Rare find: Listing broker Paula Del Nunzio, of Brown Harris Stevens said 'It's very rare to have something like this.

Icon: Ms Leibovitz is best known for her portraits of celebrities such as a Nicole Kidman, Brad Pitt, a pregnant Demi Moore . A breach of contract lawsuit against Ms Leibovitz was filed by Art Capital Group for $24 million regarding the repayment of her loans. However Art Capital Group withdrew its lawsuit against Ms Leibovitz a few months later in 2009 and extended the due date for repayment of the $24 million loan. Under the agreement, Ms Leibovitz . continues to retain control over her work, and is still the 'exclusive . agent in the sale of her real property (land) and copyrights.' The sale of her home will likely cover a majority of what she still must repay. 'It’s a big step on her road to financial recovery,' a source said.

Lauren Bush Lauren's mother, Sharon Smith Bush, a broker at the property management compant Corcoran, apparently helped represent her during the home buying process.

"By . Associated Press . Spring City Councilman Neil Sorensen wants every citizen and teacher armed. The full city council has agreed to debate the bill next month. Officials in a small Utah town want to . make sure every head of household has a firearm and knows how to use it, and . they want to give school teachers training with guns too. Spring City Councilman Neil Sorensen first . proposed an ordinance requiring a gun in every household in the town of 1,000. The rest of the council scoffed at making it a requirement, but they . unanimously agreed to move forward with an ordinance ""recommending"" the idea. The council also approved funding to offer . concealed firearms training Friday to the 20 teachers and administrators at the . local elementary school. 'It sends a statement that criminals . better think twice,' Sorensen told The Associated Press on Tuesday. 'If a teacher would have had a concealed weapon in Sandy Hook, I think the . death loss would have been fewer. If sane, trained people had guns, they could . have shot back.' Sandy Hook is the school in Newtown, . Connecticut, where a man killed 20 children and six adults in a rampage in . December. The measure, which will go before the full . council in February for further review, seems to have the support of the . council's five members and many residents in the farming community about 90 . miles south of Salt Lake City. But school administrators don't think . arming teachers is wise, and they are not encouraging teachers to participate . in Friday's training. 'The more guns you have in the . school, the more dangerous it is,' said Leslie Keisel, superintendent of . the North Sanpete School District. Councilman Noel Bertelson said making guns . in every house mandatory was too much, but he agrees the town would be safer if . everyone was armed. With only a part-time police force, he said, response time . is not like it is in a big city. 'If a person is able to take care of . themselves for a while, it would probably be a good thing,' Bertelson . said. Police lead students out of Sandy Hook Elementary School last month after 20 children were fatally shot. Sorensen said mass shootings such as this would be reduced if teachers had guns . The community is still reeling from the . double-murder on New Year's Eve 2011 of an elderly couple in nearby Mount . Pleasant. Sorensen said what used to be a peaceful, quiet town has been sullied . by increasing criminal activity. Thefts of metal for scrap and other . property also have become a problem, Councilman Boyd Mickel said. 'We are kind of tired of people . breaking in and taking stuff,' said Mickel, explaining why he voted to . urge every house to have a gun. Timm Thompson, a coal miner and father of . four girls who lives in Spring City, backs the council's measure. 'People think small towns are a good . place to live,' Thompson said. 'But there is more crime and drugs . than you can imagine.' Thompson, who owns 78 guns he keeps locked . in a safe, doesn't want teachers to act as police officers. He said some kids . are ""hooligans"" and could overpower teachers for the guns. The legislation would arm and train every citizen with a gun, such as this one . Sisters Katy Harmer and Caroline Lott, . however, say arming teachers would make them feel better about sending their . children to the Spring City Elementary School. The co-owners of the town's . coffee shop, Das Coffee, said most Spring City residents keep guns for hunting, . leaving only a handful without weapons. Spring City leaders say they got the idea . from a city in Georgia that passed a similar law. In 1982, Kennesaw, Georgia, . made headlines by requiring heads of households to own a gun and ammunition. On . its website, Kennesaw boasts that its burglary rate declined after the law took . effect. But Thomas doesn't believe having more . armed teachers would necessarily prevent or mitigate the damage in mass . shootings. Utah law allows teachers to have concealed weapon in classrooms, but . the district doesn't advocate for that, Thomas said. 'By bringing weapons into school, are . we creating more problems than we are solving?' he asked. 'It could . create a new problem. We don't want to deal with that problem.'","Law would arm every head of household and teacher in Spring City .

"By . Nazia Parveen . A 14-year-old has pleaded guilty to a string of sexual assaults near a top university. The bespectacled schoolboy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, admitted attacking a dozen women. He initially pleaded guilty to five counts of sexual assault on five other women, committed over a fortnight near the University of Manchester earlier this year. Officers had suspected the perpetrator was as young as 12. Yesterday, appearing in court with his father, the youth admitted seven more counts of sexual assault against seven women aged between 17 and 48. Assaults: The women were attacked outside Manchester University . Detective Chief Inspector Colin Larkin of Greater Manchester Police said: ‘For such a young boy to have committed such appalling attacks is both disturbing and unusual. More than anything, I am pleased for the women whom this boy sexually assaulted that they have been able to see justice carried out so quickly.’ The first attack, on a 32-year-old, took place in August. It was followed by a second eight days later, on an 18-year-old, near a business centre. The next assault took place at the end of the university’s fresher’s week in September. The court heard that the campus was near the boy’s local mosque, which he attends on a regular basis. It is understood the boy touched a 22-year-old’s backside as she walked near the university’s library in the early evening. An hour later, a 27-year-old was grabbed from behind as she walked through the campus. The woman screamed, and the youngster threatened her before running away. Fifteen minutes after this, the boy aimed lewd comments at a 21-year-old leaving the library, before following her and then sexually assaulting her. A fortnight later, he groped a 32-year-old in the car park of the Museum of Science and Industry near the university. Two hours later, another 32-year-old was grabbed around the torso near the museum before being assaulted. He attacked three other women aged between 18 and 35 on the university campus that same day. The last attack took place on October 9 near his home in Prestwich, Greater Manchester, when he touched a 48-year-old’s breast. Attacks: The bespectacled schoolboy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, admits attacking a dozen women . The teenager was arrested later that month along with his 18-year-old brother, who has been released without charge. After the attacker’s initial guilty pleas, police investigated whether he had committed other similar offences. DCI Larkin said: ‘As a direct result, other women who were assaulted by this boy came forward and we were able to present such overwhelming evidence to the courts that the young boy had no choice but to admit his guilt.’ The boy, who has no previous convictions, will be sentenced on February 28. District Judge Khalid Qureshi granted bail on condition that he adheres to a curfew and does not visit the university and its surrounding area. Manchester magistrates’ court heard that experts must now compile psychological reports to ‘assess [the attacker’s] dangerousness’. His barrister Simon Harrison said: ‘One of the new [sexual assaults] was committed near his home, which is a break from his normal offending behaviour which has centred on the university campus. This gives us cause for concern and we are preparing a psychiatric report.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","He initially pleaded guilty to five counts of sexual assault on five women .

Education officials in Pakistan have banned the memoir of Malala Yousafzai, the teenager shot by the Taliban, from 40,000 schools as she 'represents the West'. Adeeb Javedani, president of the All . Pakistan Private Schools Management Association, said his group had banned the book from the libraries of all affiliated schools. He said Malala, 16, was representing the West, not Pakistan. The memoir, called I Am Malala, was written by the teenager with British journalist Christina Lamb. The book details her extraordinary story and her continued role as an activist. When she was just 14 years old, Malala was wounded by masked gunmen who singled her out as she returned home in a school bus in Pakistan’s north-west Swat Valley. She was targeted by the Taliban after speaking out against atrocities committed under the regime in October 2012. According to Malala's friend Shazia, speaking to the Christian Science Monitor a few days after the shooting, a group of militants riding on a bike stopped the bus carrying the schoolgirls. The masked men then boarded the vehicle and pointed guns at the girls, asking for Malala. Education: Adeeb Javedani, president of the All Pakistan Private Schools Management Association, said Malala, pictured, 'represented the west' Attack: The teenager, pictured recovering in Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, was shot in the head by Taliban gunmen in Pakistan in October of last year . According to the girl, a hooded Taliban . militant shouted: 'Which one of you is Malala? 'Speak up, otherwise I . will shoot you all. She is propagating against the soldiers of Allah, . the Taliban. She must be punished.' The militant then recognised the youngster and shot her at point blank range, the girl said. Malala was treated at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham and has since made the UK her permanent home. The shooting horrified people in Pakistan and internationally and sparked worldwide condemnation. Memoirs: The teenager's remarkable story is documented in her book, released in Ocotber . Malala has become an international hero for opposing the Taliban and standing up for girls' education. But conspiracy theories have flourished in Pakistan that her shooting was staged to create a hero for the West. Last month Malala, accompanied by her father Ziauddin, gave the Queen a copy of her book during their meeting in the palace's White Drawing Room. She told her: 'It is a great honour for me to be here, and I wanted to present you with this book.' Accepting the gift, the Queen replied: 'That's very kind of you.' Malala told the Queen she was passionate about every child having a right to an education, everywhere around the world. She added: 'Especially in this country as well. I have heard about many children that can't go to school, and I want to continue our work.'","Memoir I Am Malala to be banned in 40,000 private schools in Pakistan .

"By . Amanda Williams . The secret to happiness is turning off your mobile phone and concentrating on your friends and family rather than text messages and emails . The secret to happiness lies in turning off your mobile phone and concentrating on your friends and family rather than text messages and emails, an expert on happiness has said. Professor Paul Dolan, of the London School of Economics, believes that the popularity of iPhones and other smart phones has seen people constantly having their attention drawn away from their nearest and dearest and to the devices instead. He warned that unless people changed their behaviour, they could suffer mental illness as a result. He told an audience at the Hay Festival - a celebration of culture and social responsibility -  in Cartagena, Colombia that there are also now mental conditions called internet addiction and Phantom Vibration Syndrome -  where you have a phone in your pocket and you think you have got a text message but have not. He said: 'We're constantly having our attention distracted and distraction is a cost. 'When you switch tasks it requires attention. Paying attention to what you're doing and who you are with and turning your phone off and enjoying being with your friends is much better for you than constantly checking your phone and checking emails', The Telegraph reports. Prof Dolan was once a member of the Cabinet Office's Behavioural Insight Team – or Nudge Unit. It was set up to suggest small ways that people could change their way of life to improve it. He said the solution could lie in introducing small changes to the environment in which people use their mobile phones. He used an American game called 'Don't be a d*** at dinner'  - where people put their phones and tablets in the middle of the table as an example. The first one to use it has to pay for everyone else's meal. He said it was easier to 'change the environment you were in rather than the person you are'. Professor Paul Dolan warned the extraordinary popularity of smart phones has seen people constantly having their attention drawn away from their nearest and dearest and to the devices instead . In his talk on happiness, Prof Dolan also pointed to research that people who are married or have religious faith are happier than single people or  atheists. But he did warn that married couple's happiness is relatively short-lived lasting for about 'three years'. Prof Dolan added separation was much worse for married couple's happiness than divorce because of the uncertainty it caused. His advice to anyone going through a break-up would be to 'make decisions quickly' adding that once a divorce is finalised people's happiness quickly rises. Peruvian Mario Vargas Llosa has also said society faces the prospect of an 'authoritarian nightmare of a world controlled by technology' Prof Dolan said happiness can have little to do with people's wealth. A recent survey rated Columbians as the happiest people in the world, despite having an average income of just £5,000 a year each. He said that middle-aged men in their forties are among the unhappiest that levels of satisfaction start to rise once people reach their fifties. Recent research showed that monkeys have mid-life crises too, he said. Prof Dolan's concerns about the effects of modern technology were echoed at the festival by Mario Vargas Llosa, a Nobel prize winning Peruvian author. The author told an audience that unless high culture reasserted itself in the face of television and computers, society would face the prospect of an 'authoritarian nightmare of a world controlled by technology.' The number of text messages sent in Britian each year is around 38.5billion.","Professor Paul Dolan said iPhones and tablets distract us from our loved ones .

"By . Adrian Durham . Four questions for Manchester United fans: . 1) Does David Moyes know how to get the best out of Juan Mata? My . view: time will tell but the early signs are not convincing. Mata was . desperate to play in a central role but when Wayne Rooney dropped deeper after . Michael Carrick moved to centre back at Stoke, the whole system seemed . confused. It made me wonder why Moyes didn’t bring Darren Fletcher on. Moyes . said United were the better team. Surely United fans don’t agree with . that? Moyes will be scrutinised heavily as United manager – he better . get used to it. And he can’t afford to say anything that might be . interpreted as treating the club's supporters like idiots. VIDEO   Scroll down for classic clips of players as we put questions to Man United fans . Back to the drawing board: David Moyes watched his side lose 2-1 at Stoke on Saturday . My . view: in the press conference after the game, Moyes said how pleased he . was that his players got to the bye-line and put balls in. When you play . with wingers you risk having nine players every game, especially if you . trust Ashley Young and Antonio Valencia to deliver. United should be . better than that. Talking tactics: Mata (left) is being played out of position while Moyes persists with Valencia (right) 3) Will Tom Cleverley ever deliver? My . view: I honestly didn’t realise Cleverley was playing at Stoke until . the end of the first half when I saw him standing over an injured Phil . Jones. He doesn’t dominate midfield, he doesn’t score, he doesn’t spray . passes around, there is no killer ball, he is no tough tackler and there . is no dynamism in his game. When Carrick left his side to fill in at . centre half he was exposed. He’s been given a fantastic opportunity to . run Manchester United’s midfield. But he isn’t taking that opportunity. 4) Danny Welbeck – is anybody sure yet? At . times I’ve watched Welbeck play and felt confident he would go on to . become an England regular. Then there was Saturday at Stoke when I . thought it would be just plain wrong to take him to the World Cup. His . impact on the game at Stoke was close to zero. As an England fan I want . him (and Cleverley) to do well. But given a great opportunity he simply . doesn’t seem capable of leaving observers in no doubt that he really is . the man to take United and England forward. Please prove the sceptics . wrong Danny. Jury's out: Neither Welbeck (left) nor Cleverley have convinced for Manchester United this season . Arsene Wenger and his scouting staff had 31 days of the transfer window to find a striker who’s better than Nicklas Bendtner. Astonishingly, they failed in that quest. It was Mission Impossible. Impossible to fail. Maybe a world class striker wasn’t available. But they weren’t looking for the best in the world, they were looking for someone better than Bendtner. I wonder if the Arsenal scouts went to watch January opponents Southampton in the FA Cup third round right at the start of the window. No deal: Arsene Wenger opted not to sign a striker in the January transfer window . If they did they would have seen not one but two strikers who are both better than Bendtner. Danny Ings and Sam Vokes both scored and played superbly at St Mary’s on January 4. You can look at the goals tally for both (Ings 22 all competitions, Vokes 15) but it’s the variety of the goals they score, the intelligent running, the link up play. And Burnley play very good football, they’re not long-ball merchants. Are players from Burnley good enough for Arsenal? It would be pompous and ignorant to suggest they can’t be. Look at Jay Rodriguez if you disagree. Technically brilliant, and he can finish. Dynamic duo: Ings (left) and Vokes (right) have set the Championship alight this season . Ings and Vokes are better than Bendtner. So why didn’t Arsene Wenger go for either of them? £10million would be the maximum needed for either. Maybe it's because he hasn’t got a clue about anything outside of the top flight in England. I’m talking about spotting players in the lower leagues, not signing heralded youngsters like Theo Walcott, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Carl Jenkinson. I remember Arsenal winning a penalty shootout in the League Cup against Doncaster in 2005, and after the game Wenger said he thought some of the Rovers players would have a future in the Premier League. Not one of them went on to play in the English top flight. Clearly Wenger’s encyclopaedic football knowledge doesn’t include the Football League. That’s a shame for Arsenal, because if you look closely, you’ll see there are strikers down there who are clearly better than Bendtner. Out of Nick: Bendtner is Wenger's only real alternative to first-choice Olivier Giroud . I was at Stoke on Saturday to watch them beat Manchester United 2-1, and it’s good to see Charlie Adam rediscover his form since I questioned what he brings to the Premier League a few weeks ago. His winning goal was a joy to commentate on and take nothing away from Stoke, they deserved to win the game in my opinion. But referee Neil Swarbrick was guilty of blatant inconsistency during the game. At one end Stoke’s Marc Wilson had his arms around Robin van Persie’s neck in the box – nothing given. Minutes later Chris Smalling has his arms around Jon Walters’ waist, Swarbrick gives a free-kick and Stoke score the opening goal. The ref had a clear view of both and he simply cannot give one decision and not give the other. Penalised: Chris Smalling gave away the free-kick that led to Stoke's opening goal . Why doesn’t anyone talk about Jack Colback for England? Is it because he’s ginger? How many gingers have worn the Three Lions with any success? Alan Ball in 1966 of course. But since then Ray Parlour scandalously won only 10 England caps, Paul Scholes quit England because he was being wasted on the left, and that’s about it. I’m not saying Colback should be picked because he’s ginger. But he certainly shouldn’t be overlooked because of the colour of his hair. Is he good enough? He’s better than Tom Cleverley that’s for sure. Fine form: Jack Colback has been outstanding for Sunderland since Gus Poyet took charge . Edwin van der Sar holds a world record – when he was at Manchester United he went 1,311 minutes without conceding a goal in the Premier League. That record is under threat. Celtic’s Fraser Forster is currently on 1,035 minutes in the Scottish Premiership. But don’t you think it would be an absolute scandal if Forster took that record off the Dutchman? Celtic are a heavyweight champ bossing the ring, seeing off a succession of flyweights week in, week out. Every game is a mis-match for Celtic, it will be an embarrassment if Forster doesn’t break the record. It’s no criticism of the England man – he’s just doing his job. But it would be so wrong for a keeper at such a dominant club in such an uncompetitive league to take such glory. Dutch master: Edwin van der Sar broke all manner of records as Manchester United goalkeeper . On Sunday, Forster broke Celtic’s clean . sheet record when he shut out St Mirren, making it 11 in a row. Charlie Shaw – a 5ft 6in keeper, Celtic captain and legend - set the original . record in 1922. Neil Lennon described Forster’s achievement as 'a . testament to him and the players in front of him.' Really? As Lennon also said, Forster wasn’t . 'overly worked' during the 1-0 win over St Mirren. He’s not been overly . worked all season in the Scottish Premiership. Celtic’s wage bill is more than six times . bigger than the next highest in the top flight north of the border. Rangers are out of the picture, and there is no serious challenge. So any records broken by Celtic at this . time when the Scottish Premiership is so moribund should be wiped from . history. Not only are they totally meaningless, they’re an insult to . those who worked so much harder to break the record previously. Closing in: Celtic and England goalkeeper Fraser Forster (right) has kept 11 clean sheets in a row . We should all tip our hats to Jose Mourinho, he studied Manchester City and he worked out a way to beat them. Chelsea were brilliant, and they didn’t need to park the bus. They could have scored five. There were plenty of 10 out of 10 performances among the Chelsea players in their 1-0 victory. John Terry and Gary Cahill were imperious; Nemanja Matic showed Yaya Toure how it’s done; Willian was non-stop; Branislav Ivanovic was the match-winner. But only one man was 11 out of 10 and that was Eden Hazard. He was simply stunning – strength with technique and end product, and I would happily pay good money to watch the Belgian. His role in the winning goal was fantastic. He’s the kind of player you want to take your children to see just so they can say they saw him at his best. If people simply total up goals then Luis Suarez or Sergio Aguero or maybe Aaron Ramsey will win Player of the Year. But for me Eden Hazard has been the best player in the Premier League so far this season. He’s got everything. Stunning performance: Chelsea's Eden Hazard embarks on another mesmeric run . How can a man facing charges of attempted embezzlement in Italy (which he denies), with an arrest warrant issued for him stating he has 'marked criminal tendencies…capable of using every kind of deception to achieve his ends', get anywhere near the front door at Elland Road? The Football League issued a statement on February 1 saying it was having 'conversations' with Eleonora Sports Ltd, the group led by Massimo Cellino. By that time the Italian had sacked Brian McDermott through his solicitor, signed a player (Andrea Tabanelli), and attempted to put the man he wanted to take over as manager (Gianluca Festa) in the dugout for the game against Ipswich, he was already making decisions at Leeds United. It's absolutely pathetic from the Football League, which needs to take a long, hard look at itself. After what’s happened at Leeds in the past few days, you have to question whether the League is carrying out its duty of care to clubs. Brian McDermott deserves so much better, and so do the Leeds United fans. Back in the hotseat: Brian McDermott was sacked then reinstated in a bizarre few days .","Surely Manchester United fans don't agree with David Moyes?

"By . David Gardner . The American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (ACOG) says that 'full term' should be considered to be between 39 weeks and 40 weeks six days . Babies should be considered premature even if they are born after 38 weeks, experts claimed yesterday. Up to now, babies were defined as ‘full term’ if they were born anytime from 37 to 42 weeks in the womb. They were only regarded as premature if they were born before the 37-week mark. But American doctors believe the ideal pregnancy is two weeks longer. Research shows babies born at 37 weeks are more at risk of complications, such as breathing problems, than those born at 39 weeks. New guidelines released by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists yesterday redefine the timeline for a healthy pregnancy. They say a full-term pregnancy is between 39 weeks and 40 weeks and six days. An ‘early term’ or premature baby would be born between 37 weeks and 38 weeks and six days. A late term pregnancy reaches the 41st week and by 42 weeks the baby is ‘post term’ or in other words, long overdue. ‘Weeks matter,’ said Dr Jeffrey Ecker of Massachusetts General Hospital, who chaired the committee that came up with the more specific labels. ‘Since babies’ outcomes can differ, let’s not call it all the same,’ he added. In recent years, doctors’ groups have stressed that elective deliveries – inductions and C-sections scheduled without a medical reason – shouldn’t happen before the 39th week of the pregnancy. Dr Ecker said the new definitions would help doctors communicate that message. The March of Dimes Foundation, a US group that works to improve the health of mothers and babies, welcomed the change yesterday. On average, a pregnancy lasts for 40 weeks, counting from the first day of the mother's last period. Prior to the new guidelines being released, a baby was considered to be premature if it was born before 37 weeks, and late if it was born after the 42nd week . A spokesman said it ‘eliminates confusion about how long an uncomplicated, healthy pregnancy  should last.’ According to a joint study published last year by Columbia University Medical Centre and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, children born at 37 or 38 weeks did worse in academic tests than those born just a week or two later. The additional time in the womb results in more brain development and, in later life, better scores in mathematics and reading tests. The 2012 study compared birth records and test scores for 128,000 eight year olds born in New York City in the late 1980s and early 1990s. All were born between the normal 37 and 41 weeks of gestation. Compared with those born at 41 weeks, children born at 37 weeks faced a 33 per cent  increased chance of having severe reading difficulties and a 19 per cent greater chance of having moderate problems in maths. Those born at 38 weeks fared only slightly better than those born at 37 weeks. Another UK study found premature babies are twice as likely to suffer from severe mental conditions such as depression than those born on schedule.","American College of Obstetricians and .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Black sheep: Jedediah Fox-Udall, 26, son of U.S. Senator Mark Udall, has been arrested for possession of heroin and breaking into cars . The son of a U.S. senator has been arrested on drug and trespassing charges after allegedly breaking in to several cars and being found with heroin on his person. Jedediah Lee Fox-Udall, 26, was booked into the county jail in Boulder, Colorado, on suspicion of possession of drugs and four counts of trespassing, . He is the son of Colorado Senator Mark Udall, who lives in the Eldorado Springs area of Boulder where the vehicle trespasses took place. Fox-Udall was arrested around noon on Wednesday after a witness called police to report a man breaking into cars in the semi-rural community of Eldorado Springs. Police discovered drug paraphernalia on Fox-Udall, and he admitted using heroin in the previous 48 hours, Commander Heidi Prentup said. He was released on $1,500 bond that evening and is due to appear in court on February 20. ""Maggie and I are deeply distressed to learn of our son's arrest,’ Sen. Mark Udall said in a statement to the Boulder Daily Camera. ‘We love our son and stand with him in his commitment to getting the treatment he needs. We appreciate the private space to deal with this as a family.’ Senator Udall is a Democrat Senator of Colorado who represented the region in the House of Representatives before winning his Senate seat in 2008. Senator Udall is running for re-election this year. Last July, Senator Udall's brother James 'Randy' Udall, 61, was found dead after a hiking trip in Pinedale, Wyoming.

"By . Alex Greig . An internet marketing millionaire from St George, Utah, has been accused by the Federal Trade Commission of being the 'mastermind' behind one of the biggest cases of online marketing fraud ever perpetrated in America. Jeremy Johnson, 37, has become known in his native Utah for his selfless acts of heroism, including mounting his own relief mission to Haiti after the earthquake in 2010, and literally giving the shoes off his feet. But according to the FTA, the money Johnson has so generously donated wasn't his to give, and had in fact been amassed by luring online customers with promises of free CD-ROMS for which they only had to pay a nominal shipping fee. These customers' credit cards would then be charged for recurring monthly memberships they hadn't agreed to and weren't aware of. Alleged scam: Indicted St. George businessman Jeremy Johnson walks to the federal courthouse before a hearing Thursday, June 13, 2013, in Salt Lake City . Over a five-year period, the company of which Johnson was founder and CEO, I Works, allegedly stole more than $275 million from customers, and discouraged them from seeking compensation from their credit card companies by threatening to report them to a website called BadCustomer.com - a site run by I Works. And while Johnson's philanthropy was well-known, his lifestyle was not exactly humble. According to The New York Times, . he owns a 22,000-square-foot home in a gated community in a St. George . suburb, a 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air and other classic cars, houseboats and . helicopters. His case files contain statements from witnesses alleging . he 'amassed bundles of cash and buried caches of gold'. It's . a fall from a great height for the six-foot-tall, red-headed Johnson, . who appeared to be casting himself into the 'affable millionaire' mold . by rescuing stranded mountaineers in his helicopter and housing people . fleeing from Utah's polygamous communities. 'When I think of Jeremy Johnson, I . think of the most generous person I ever met,' Daniel Gardner, an . assistant loan officer in Provo, Utah and friend of Johnson, told The . New York Times. 'Whatever he had, he would give and give and give.' Gardner described Johnson, who he met as a boy scout, as 'one of the most Christ-like people I have ever come to know.' Philanthropy: Here, Johnson works to provide aid for people affected by the Haiti earthquake in 2010 . In addition to the FTA investigation, Johnson and five of his associates are now facing 86 related criminal charges, including making false statements to bank, wire fraud, bank fraud, engaging in fraudulent banking activities, conspiracy to launder money and money laundering brought by the United States attorney in Utah. Johnson categorically denies any wrongdoing in both cases. According the the Times, court filings by his lawyers say the FTC's case is 'filled with half-truths, distortions and inflammatory rhetoric that is not supported by the evidence.' According to The Salt Lake Tribune, the company allegedly set up 80 'shell accounts' to accept payments without being detected. High places: Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff received more than $200,000 in campaign donations from Jeremy Johnson but is no longer commenting on Johnson or the case . 'They had no employees, they had no office locations, they were mail . drops,' Collot Guerard, the lead FTC attorney on the lawsuit, told the . Tribune. 'They were essentially fronts, and they didn't have any . substance to them other than lending their name to obtain a new merchant . account when Jeremy Johnson and I Works were no longer able to get . merchant accounts.' Johnson's business offered customers catalogs of government grants and information about how to apply for them. Once someone signed up for a catalog, to be delivered via main on a CD-ROM, they were then given one week to cancel their membership, after which they were signed up for membership to various different programs which all charged a monthly fee. Denial: Johnson has denied any wrongdoing in the case against him, in which he allegedly swindled more than $275 million from unwitting consumers . This is legal - if the marketing material makes full disclosure to the customer and the customer consents. But according to federal prosecutors, I Works-affiliated sites often displayed disclosures in very small print, and sometimes didn't disclose the information at all. According to The New York Times, the FTC began investigating I Works in 2009 after Visa noticed an ever-growing number of customers wanting to reverse charges for online membership programs, called a 'chargeback'. It was difficult at first to link the chargebacks to I Works, since the company was operating under so many different names and so many different programs, including Easy Grant Finder, Bottom Dollar, Business Funding Success, Fast Gov Grants, Cloud Nine Marketing, CPA Upsell Inc., Employee Plus and many, many more, according to court papers. I Works was closed after the charges were brought, but according to prosecutors, Johnson transferred many of his assets, including gold bullion and his home, into the names of his parents and his wife, Sharla, who have now been named as 'relief defendants' by prosecutors for receiving ill-gotten gains. Johnson went on the offensive after being indicted. According to The Salt Lake Tribune, he launched an online campaign to clear his name. He accused federal prosecutors of threatening to indict his family if he doesn't plead guilty in his criminal case and accused a FTC attorney of tampering with witnesses in YouTube videos, created an EvilFTC.com website which he promoted on Twitter, made a Facebook page where people can make negative comments about the United States Attorney for the District of Utah and conducted interviews with reporters in which he reiterated the points he's made online. Federal prosecutors grew weary of this and a federal judge granted a gag order against Johnson and his associates to prevent them from commenting publicly about the case. According to the Tribune, Johnson has been arrested twice since he was charged in 2010: 'once in a . Phoenix airport attempting to leave the country en route to Costa Rica, . a few months after receiving a federal indictment for mail fraud' and again 'in Washington County for an outstanding Nevada . warrant, which was issued after he bounced several bad checks meant to . cover more than $100,000 in gambling losses at a Las Vegas casino'. The FTC case against Johnson in the District Court of Nevada is ongoing, and the criminal charges against him will be pursued at its conclusion.","Jeremy Johnson, 37, is charged with defrauding more than $275 million from 'unwitting' customers over five years in an online marketing scam .

"By . Sean O'hare . Police released this picture of Anthony Stubbs with baby Lily on the day she was born . A mother has issued a desperate plea for her missing 16-year-old son to come home for Christmas and distributed a picture of him cradling his newborn daughter in the hope it will prompt him to get in touch. School prefect Anthony Stubbs vanished last month following a row with his 18-year-old girlfriend, just weeks after she gave birth to their daughter, Lily. He has not been seen or heard from since and it is believed his bank account remains untouched. Lancashire police hope by publicly distributing pictures of Lily on the day she . was born, he may get in touch with his family. Anthony’s mother Denise, 34, broke down in tears at a news conference . as she said: 'Christmas is a time for family and all I want is for . Anthony to come home. 'It is his daughter Lily’s first Christmas . and he should be here to celebrate with her and the rest of the family. All the family have support for him - we’re not angry, we just want him . to come home.” She added: 'If Anthony was to walk back in it would . be brilliant - Christmas would be brilliant and him coming back would . be the best Christmas present ever. 'We just don’t understand why . he’s gone. he had already made plans for Christmas. He’d already bought a . stocking for Lily and I urge him to come back for the sake of his baby. 'If . he has any problems, it’s ok, I know why he went and I know what . pressure he was under and I just want him to come home so we can sort it . all out. Running away isn’t the answer, he needs to be with his family. 'It’s . very out of character to go, he loves his baby so much, he idolises . that child, the way he looks at her. He might have had pressures but he . loved that little girl. Denise Machin mother of Anthony Stubbs breaks down during public appeal for help over her missing son . 'Just tell me his alright - it’s the not . knowing that’s killing me, I’m jumping to conclusions. I want to make . sure he’s safe and well looked after - if he’s not ready to come home, . my door is always open for him, if he or someone could just contact me, . it won’t take the heartache away, but at least I’ll know he’s safe. 'Anthony . may have grown up too fast but he can also be gullible and the fact he . is very loving and caring might lead to some people taking advantage of . him.' Following reports of an argument with his teenage girlfriend he . walked out of their home last month intending to go to his mother’s address a ten . minute walk away, but he never arrived. Last September the Year 11 pupil  who is studying for his GCSEs at Wellfield Business and Enterprise . College in Leyland, Lancashire, was delighted when his girlfriend Charlotte . Mason gave birth to their daughter Lily. Despite concerns . from his family about his schooling, the teenager who is due to sit his . exams next year set up home with Charlotte and Lily at a house in the . town. Anthony who enjoys . music and outdoor pursuits found out he was going to be dad when he was . just 15 and had just celebrated his 16th birthday when Lily was born.

The last confirmed sighting of Anthony was as he walked with his schoolbag over his shoulder near to the Seven Stars public house in Leyland at 12:55pm on Sunday 25th November. Anthony’s family said the day before he went missing Anthony failed to show for at a ceremony where his grandparents were renewing their wedding vows on their anniversary. Denise added: 'When Anthony didn’t come to the ceremony, I thought it was because he was busy at home with the baby; I didn’t want to interfere. 'But on Sunday at about 4pm his girlfriend sent me a text to ask me when he was going back home to her - and that’s when we realised he was missing. 'I waited until it had been 24 hours and then went straight to the police station on Monday, because I knew then that something had happened. 'He’s a great lad. He always puts everyone before himself, he helps with anything, he is into all his school activities, music, performing arts, he is a head prefect, head of house - a really good student. 'Christmas is going to be empty unless he comes home. He brings life to Christmas and always cracks how own jokes to make me laugh. 'He’d say, ‘Mother Goose cheer up it’s Christmas’ and he’d always put the star up on the tree because I couldn’t reach. His little brother Oscar who is only three keeps asking where Anthony is and I tell him he’s on holiday. Girlfriend Charlotte Mason lived with Anthony and baby Lily in a house in Leyand, Lancashire . Baby Lily was born shortly after her father Anthony Stubb's 16th birthday . Anthony is not believed to have used his bank account since going missing . Anthony pictured here with his girlfriend Charlotte Mason before he went missing on November 25 . Despite concerns from his family about his schooling, Anthony set up home with Charlotte and Lily at a house in Leyland, Lancashire . Anthony’s cousin and best friend Katie Smith, 15 said: 'He mentioned that he wanted to move back in with his mum but this was a few weeks before, he just said he’d had enough of living at Charlotte’s. 'I last saw him the Friday of that weekend, we’d finished English revision and we were going out with my mum and dad to get stuff for the wedding - it was my nana’s wedding. That’s the last time we saw him.' Det Insp John Entwisle of Lancashire Police said: 'We’re following all the leads, all the contacts, we’re pursuing all avenues. 'We’re hoping Anthony will see this and come into a police station - wherever he is and just show that he’s fit and well and we can assure Denise that he’s alive and with us. 'He has a three month old baby at home who we know he must miss and our main aim is to locate Anthony safe and well, and bring him home to his family for Christmas.'","Anthony disappeared after row with 18-year-old girlfriend on November 25 .

Carrot Fit is the latest ‘sadistic’ app from Pennsylvania developer Brian Mueller designed to 'threaten, intimidate and ridicule' users into losing weight. Users input their weight on a daily basis, and receive judgement from the ‘Carrot overlord’, yet equally, if they lose weight, Carrot will offer encouragement. Scroll down for video . Carrot Fit is the latest 'sadistic' app, pictured, from Pennsylvania developer Brian Mueller designed to threaten, intimidate and ridicule users into losing weight. Users input their weight on a daily basis, and receive judgement from the 'Carrot overlord'. Equally, if they lose weight, Carrot will offer encouragement . Scientists in Southampton have developed a 'smart bra' which can measure the wearer’s mood. The bra is fitted with sensors which monitor heart and skin activity. Researchers claim that by monitoring emotions, the bra can help prevent over-eating and potentially aid weight loss. Not only does the bra warn the wearer when she might be prone to reaching for food, but it gives her tips to help resist the impulse. As well as encouragement, people who lose weight will also be given rewards such as workout tips and advice. According to the app description: 'Carrot is a sadistic AI construct with one simple goal: to transform your flabby carcass into a Grade A specimen of the human race. 'She will do whatever it takes - including threatening, inspiring, ridiculing, and bribing you - to make this happen. You will lose weight - or else.' As a user tracks their weight, Carrot Fit will  monitor their BMI and update them on their progress. All weight loss is tracked on a graph that can be shared with friends and at each weigh-in, Carrot will let the user know how much they've lost and the difference compared to the previous weigh-in. As a user tracks their weight, Carrot Fit will also monitor their BMI and update them on their progress. Carrot will let the user know how much they’ve lost and the difference compared to the previous weigh-in. If the user gains weight, the app turns red, pictured left, but if they lose weight, it turns green, right . Users can set goal weights, share their progress with friends and set reminder to weigh themselves. Mueller said he didn’t create Carrot Fit to make people feel bad, instead he wanted to make 'weight loss entertaining and funny.' The app costs £1.49 ($1.99 on the U.S. store) and future updates will include features described as ‘Deathmarch 5K’ and the ‘6-Minute Workout.’ Elsewhere, Mueller plans to add a calorie counter and Carrot Fit could one day be used with smartscales, connected via Wi-Fi. An Android app is in development, but Mueller does not have a release date. Mueller has previously created similar apps, called Carrot To-Do and Carrot Alarm, that both use an avatar to encourage users to be more productive, or active.","The £1.49 ($1.99) Carrot Fit iOS app is classed as a ‘Talking Weight Tracker’

"By . Associated Press . Less than a week after they won a $96.5 million Powerball prize, an eastern Missouri husband and wife have already made big changes in their lives and big plans for their future. John and Susan Brands, both 49, of St. Charles, were identified Friday by the Missouri Lottery as the winners of the jackpot in the March 22 drawing. Susan Brands is studying web design and plans to finish out the semester, according to a news release from the Missouri Lottery. The couple also plan to replace the older-model cars they're driving. Single winner: A Missouri couple claimed the only winning ticket in last week's $96.5million PowerBall jackpot . Since discovering the morning after the drawing that his ticket matched all five numbers plus the Powerball, John Brands has quit his job as a civil engineer. The native of Portageville, Mo., is thinking of buying some farmland. 'Like the line from the movie 'O Brother, Where Art Thou': 'You ain't no kind of man, if you ain't got land,' he said. Susan Brands, a native of Wichita, Kan., said she's looking forward to traveling, including a trip to New Zealand. Why New Zealand? 'We're nerds,' she said. 'That's where 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit' were filmed' The couple also said they plan to explore interests for which they haven't had time, such as learning new languages, going to culinary school and, for John, taking guitar lessons. John Brands purchased the winning ticket at Bridgeton Mobil in suburban St. Louis. He let the computer select the winning combination, which was: 13, 28, 31, 55, 58, Powerball 15.","John and Susan Brands, both 49, of St Charles, claimed the prize .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A plane was forced to make an emergency landing at New York's Kennedy airport this morning after striking a bird. JetBlue Flight 671 took off from Westchester County Airport in White Plains at 9:05 a.m. en route to Palm Beach International Airport in Florida. About 25 minutes after take off, the Airbus A320 collided with the bird, the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement. With 142 passengers on board, the pilots declared an emergency and decided to divert the flight to JFK as a precaution. Ouch: A bird, pictured, smashed beak-first into a JetBlue flight bound for Florida Friday morning, forcing an emergency landing at Kennedy Airport . The plane safely landed there around 9:55 a.m., with no injuries. Port Authority of New York and New Jersey spokesman Joe Pentangelo confirmed the JetBlue flight reported the bird strike Friday morning before landing at the airport, which is run by the agency. Customers were given the option of being put on another flight from JFK to Palm Beach or taken back to Westchester County. Twitter user Chris Balduino posted pictures of the plane with a bird carcass lodged in the nose of it. A second image showed what appeared to be a hole caused by the collision and the bird's blood streaked on the aircraft.

The 55-year-old was battered against a sea wall for 15 minutes in Hartlepool after his black Labrador was washed into the churning waves from a concrete slipway. The two men put their own lives at risk to drag out the man, who had tied up his three other dogs next to the Headland promenade before diving into the sea.

Heroes: Two men (centre) jumped into the water to rescue the man, putting their own lives at risk . One of the men, a fisherman, ran a quarter of a mile to fetch a life ring in an attempt to save the dog owner. Eventually they managed to drag the visibly distressed man out of the water where he was assisted by Hartlepool Coastguard, police and paramedics. The dog was also saved. The man was treated at the scene for up to an hour before being taken to the University Hospital of North Tees in nearby Stockton. A spokesperson for Humber Coastguard said it had tasked colleagues in Hartlepool to deal with the emergency. 'Hartlepool Police called us at 2:15pm to say they had taken a call from a member of the public to say a man had entered the water to rescue one of his dogs,' he said.

"By . Alexandra Klausner . and Associated Press . Chrissy Lee Smith, 35, was found guilty of sexual assault against a 15-year-old boy . A jury has found a former Lancaster County teacher guilty of having sex with a 15-year-old student in 2008. It took less than an hour for the jury to return with the verdict Wednesday against 35-year-old Christy Smith. The jury convicted her of four counts including sexual assault, corruption of a minor and involuntary deviant sexual assault. She faces up to 10 years in prison. Smith testified that she and the student kissed but they didn't have sex. The former unmarried McCaskey High School teacher had her 2012 conviction overturned when a state court ruled that she should have faced separate trials on allegations that she preyed on two boys, then aged 15 and 17. She is still awaiting trial on the other charges. Back in 2012 Smith was convicted on 18 counts of having sex with two male students. Both students testified at her trial at Lancaster County Court and both students gave similar accounts of their sexual relationship with the teacher. The two victims were able to give specific details about Smith's apartment where the sex acts took place and about Smith herself. The sex acts occurred at Smith's home at at 717 College Ave in Lancaster, Philadelphia . The 15 year old student, now in his early twenties, met Smith while he was a Sophomore at McCasky High School and claims that she initiated a sexual relationship with him. The 17 year old victim, now in his mid to early twenties, was a senior at nearby Solanco High School and met Smith at a local dance class. Smith was also found guilty of eight felony counts of child pornogrphy for having photos the students exchanged via their cell phones. Investigators told Pennlive.com that Smith's sexual relationship with the 15-year-old ended when the school district began investigating accusations that she was molesting the victim. Smith was allegedly having sex with the other teenager when she was arrested. In her 2012 conviction, prosecutors argued that her crimes we 'a pattern of behavior' and that she opened up about her personal life to relate to her younger students and then prey on them sexually, reports Lancaster Online.

Solid wall insulation could save customers £490, while loft insulation could reduce their bills by £180. Npower's national survey also found that the main reasons for not putting energy saving improvements in place include: 42 per cent not being able to afford it, 36 per cent blaming lack of government support and a third who claim the problem isn’t big enough.

"By . Reuters . Adidas has launched a new store blueprint for its Originals fashion brand with a Wi-Fi equipped lounge and mobile charging points, aiming to persuade younger shoppers to linger longer and spend more in its high-margin, own-run outlets. The world's No.2 sportswear maker behind Nike wants to lift sales from its own shops, which accounted for 24per cent of its 2013 revenue of approximately $20billion, because they are more profitable than those made through third parties. The revamped Originals store in the heart of Berlin is part of a drive to encourage 16-24 year-olds to browse longer. Plugged in: The new Adidas store in Berlin (pictured) is meant to attend to millennials' needs with Apple store-esque charging ports and wi-fi . ‘Shopping for this generation is very social. They need to have a place to hang out. The longer the consumer stays in the store, the more likely they are to buy,’ Ted Mager, Adidas global head of retail environments, told Reuters. The shift from wholesale to retail helped boost the German firm's gross margin by 1.5 percentage points to 49.3per cent in 2013 compared with 43.6per cent for Nike, which makes less than a fifth of sales from its own stores and online. Adidas plans to open a net 250 stores in 2014, primarily in eastern Europe, even though its already high exposure to Russia - where it operates over 1,000 stores - has hurt its share price in recent weeks due to the Ukraine crisis. It added a net 294 stores in 2013 to bring the total to 2,740, including about 250 stores under the Originals brand, but not counting some 7,500 Adidas franchises operated in China. In addition to a Wi-Fi lounge near the fitting rooms and a ‘digital bar’ for charging devices, the revamped store seeks to reflect the Berlin urban vibe by stripping back decor to raw concrete and brick and exposing lighting, while underwear is displayed in an eye-catching vending machine. Prominently featured: Adidas highlights its line of sneakers in the store - a key selling point among young people . The new Berlin format gives more prominence to footwear, including high-heel sneakers designed by Moschino creative director Jeremy Scott and multicolor variants of the recently-relaunched classic white-and-green Stan Smith tennis shoes. Previously a male-oriented brand, the store seeks to more clearly showcase women's wear as well as collaborations with partners such as fashion chain Top Shop and colorful Brazilian brand The Farm, timed for the soccer World Cup starting in June. Adidas plans to roll out the concept to Originals stores in over 30 cities, with London and Shanghai next for the makeover. It also has big ambitions for its new teen fashion brand NEO, which is being extended to Poland and the Czech Republic. However, sports-inspired fashion is becoming increasingly competitive with big players such as Sweden's Hennes & Mauritz, Japan's Uniqlo and Gap all offering more sportswear in recent years. Casual clothes: Another big seller, hoodies and track jackets, are also on full display in the store . And Adidas, which has been losing market share in Europe to Nike, must make sure the push into fashion does not distract from a core focus on sports performance, a mistake that cost German rival Puma dear. To that end, it is also revamping its flagship sportswear stores, seeking to create a stadium-like experience and, like the new Originals store, putting a focus on footwear and creating a multi-media experience for shoppers. 'Footwear is treated as the centre of the brand and the heart of the experience,' Mager said. 'The consumer can buy everything, anywhere online. We need to give them a compelling reason to come into the store.'","The sportswear giant is hoping that the longer customers stay in the store, the more likely they are to buy .
The new Adidas retail model echoes that of Apple, where shoppers can browse online on its latest products ."

Stephen Wilson speaks Thursday to reporters at the Pentagon during a briefing where he announced preliminary findings in the investigation . 'They tended to be at the hub' of illicit . exchanges of test information, said Adam Lowther, one of seven . investigators who dug into details of cheating that has embarrassed the . Air Force and on Thursday brought down virtually the entire operational . command of the 341st Missile Wing at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Mont. Wilson said the quartet of enablers were at 'the crux of it,' and that three of the four also are accused of illegal drug activity. The rest of the accused either participated in cheating or were aware of it but failed to blow the whistle. Lowther said the investigation team examined evidence from cellphones allegedly used to transmit the offending text messages but was unable to interview either of the four suspects because they each obtained legal counsel as soon as they became aware of the investigation. Those four have not yet been publicly named. The Air Force fired nine mid-level commanders at Malmstrom and announced it will pursue a range of disciplinary action against the accused 82, possibly to include courts-martial, in response to the findings. A 10th commander, the senior officer at the base, resigned and will retire from the Air Force. More questions than answers: Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James, accompanied by Wilson, during a Q&A session after a Thursday press briefing . Air Force officials called the discipline unprecedented in the history of America's intercontinental ballistic missile force. An Associated Press expose last year revealed a series of security and other problems in the ICBM force, including a failed safety and security inspection at Malmstrom, where the exam cheating occurred. Lowther said the investigation team interviewed missile launch officers and others at the Air Force's two other ICBM bases and found no indication of cheating there. 'Folks clearly crossed the line at Malmstrom,' Lowther said in a telephone interview. He is a faculty member at the Air Force Research Institute at Maxwell Air Force Base, Ala. The investigators found what Lowther described as 'a persistent cultural problem' inside the ICBM force — a perception among the crews 'that you don't want to be there,' in part because of a sense that the mission is not highly valued. In an emotion-charged resignation letter titled 'A Lesson to Remember,' Col. Robert Stanley, who commanded the 341st Missile Wing at Malmstrom, lamented that the reputation of the ICBM mission was now 'tarnished because of the extraordinarily selfish actions of officers entrusted with the most powerful weapon system ever devised by man.' Stanley, seen as a rising star in the Air Force, had been nominated for promotion to brigadier general just days before the cheating scandal came to light in January. Instead he is retiring, convinced, as he wrote in his farewell letter Thursday, that 'we let the American people down on my watch.' Gone: US Air Force shows Col. Robert Stanley II, the top commander at the Montana base where the exam cheating was discovered in January, has resigned . Separately, another of the Air Force's nuclear missile units — the 90th Missile Wing at F.E. Warren Air Force Base, Wyo. — announced that it had fired the officer overseeing its missile squadrons. It said Col. Donald Holloway, the operations group commander, was sacked 'because of a loss of confidence in his ability to lead.' The 90th Missile Wing offered no further explanation for Holloway's removal and said it 'has nothing to do' with the firings announced by the Air Force in Washington. Together, the extraordinary moves reflect turmoil in a force that remains central to American defense strategy, but, in some ways, has been neglected. The force of 450 Minuteman 3 missiles is primed to unleash nuclear devastation on a moment's notice, capable of obliterating people and places halfway around the globe. In a bid to correct root causes of the missile corps' failings — including low morale and weak management — the Air Force also announced Thursday a series of new or expanded programs to improve leadership development, to modernize the three ICBM bases and to reinforce 'core values,' including integrity. Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James, the service's top civilian official, told a Pentagon news conference that a thorough review of how testing and training are conducted in the ICBM force has produced numerous avenues for improvements. 'We will be changing rather dramatically how we conduct testing and training going forward,' while ensuring that performance standards are kept high, James said. More funds will be invested in refurbishing the underground ICBM launch control centers and making other infrastructure improvements, she added. Wilson, head of all Air Force nuclear forces as commander of Global Strike Command, said the changes in training and testing will be far-reaching. 'We're not just putting a fresh coat of paint on these problems,' he said. 'We're taking bold action.' Disciplinary measures: James and Wilson announced the firing nine mid-level commanders and disciplining of dozens of additional junior officers . James had promised to hold officers at Malmstrom accountable once the cheating investigation was completed and the scope of the scandal was clear. None of the nine fired commanders was directly involved in the cheating, but each was determined to have failed in his or her leadership responsibilities. Wilson said investigators determined that the cheating, which officials originally said happened in August or September last year, began as early as November 2011 and continued until November 2013. A total of 100 missile launch crew members were identified as potentially involved in the cheating, but nine were cleared by investigators. Another nine of the 100 are being handled separately by the Air Force Office of Special Investigation; eight of those nine involve possible criminal charges stemming from the alleged mishandling of classified information. The cheating involved unauthorized passing of answers to exams designed to test missile launch officers' proficiency in handling 'emergency war orders,' which are messages involving the targeting and launching of missiles. Nine key commanders below Stanley were fired, including the commanders of the 341st Wing's three missile squadrons, each of which is responsible for 50 Minuteman 3 nuclear missiles. Also sacked were the commander and deputy commander of the 341st Operations Group, which oversees all three missile squadrons as well as a helicopter unit and a support squadron responsible for administering monthly proficiency tests to Malmstrom's launch crews and evaluating their performance. No generals are being punished. Maj. Gen. Michael Carey, who was relieved in October of his duty as commander of the 20th Air Force, which is responsible for all three 150-missile wings of the ICBM force, is still on duty as a staff officer at Air Force Space Command but has requested retirement; his request is being reviewed. Carey was fired after a military investigation determined that he had engaged in inappropriate behavior while leading a U.S. government delegation to a nuclear security exercise in Russia last summer. He was replaced by Maj. Gen. Jack Weinstein. The cheating at Malmstrom was discovered in early January during the course of an unrelated drug investigation that included two launch officers at Malmstrom and others at several other bases. The drug probe is continuing. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Four junior officers are said to have facilitated the cheating among dozens of missile operators .

"By . Louise Eccles . and Amanda Williams . John Garner, 53, died after being found with serious head and leg injuries surrounded by debris, oil and thick smoke off the coast of St Vincent on Wednesday . Police have launched a murder investigation after a British man was found dead aboard his burnt-out yacht in the Caribbean Sea. Sailing instructor John Edward Garner, 53, was discovered with head and leg injuries after the coastguard responded to reports that a yacht was on fire off the coast of St Vincent. He was pronounced dead upon arrival at hospital yesterday afternoon. Police . are now searching for a woman called Heidi Hukkelaas, with whom he flew . to St Vincent on January 19. She is believed to be his Norwegian wife. But ex-pats living on the island - including the dive instructor who discovered Mr Garner's body - say Miss Hukkelaas left her partner two days previously, to return to Norway to look after her children, as planned. And despite Caribbean police claiming to be searching for Ms Hukkelaas, Norwegian authorities said no requests have been made with them regarding her whereabouts, only to inform Norwegian relatives that Mr Garner had died. 'We have not been asked to do anything but inform relatives of the incident,’ a spokesperson for Norwegian Police told Verdens Gang. ‘We are not aware that the Norwegian woman is wanted internationally and there is no such request regarding this woman in our system.’ Kay Wilson, who owns Indigo Watersports, and is originally from Bristol, said she was taking a boat trip full of guests from a nearby hotel resort, when she saw smoke on the horizon and went to investigate. She said she and her crew discovered Mr Garner's body free floating in the water wearing a life jacket, with severe lacerations to his face and legs. A burning life raft was also found close to the yacht, which was well ablaze, she said. His passport and personal documents were floating nearby in a waterproof 'grab bag' - a tool commonly used by yachtsman in case of emergency. Only his personal details were found in the bag, indicating that he was alone, she said. She said: 'There was a lot of debris in the water, as there commonly is with explosions. 'He was free floating in the water. A life raft was nearby but it didn't appear to have deployed properly and that was on fire too. 'The heat from the burning vessel was such that we could feel it when we were approaching.' A local TV station posted this picture believed to be of the yacht on fire off the coast of St Vincent . St Vincent . police commissioner Michael Charles said: ‘We are treating the death as . suspicious and are looking at all lines of inquiry. We suspect foul play and will investigate the matter fully. ‘Miss . Hukkelaas is a person of interest and as with every murder . investigation we have to look at everyone and everything and will leave . no stones unturned.’ Officers said checks revealed Miss Hukkelaas had not left the country via any of the island’s main airports or seaports. The commissioner refused to confirm her nationality or relationship to the deceased last night. However, . Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang has been in touch with the Ms . Hukkelaas' family and they have confirmed that she is back in her home . country, arriving the day before the incident. Mr Garner's daughter Elisabeth, 37, . told the MailOnline that her family were unaware that her father's death . was being treated as suspicious, and was instead a 'tragic accident'. She . said she had spoken to her step-mother who had left St Vincent two days . before Mr Garner, to head back to Norway and look after her young . children. She said: 'She always leaves before him. 'This . is a shock for everybody. We have not been told that this is being . treated as suspicious. As far as we have been told, it is being treated . as a tragic accident.' Ms Wilson said she also believed it could have been simply an accident. Police say the life raft was found approximately 15 nautical miles west of Buccament in southwestern St. Vincent . She . said: 'It was lunchtime, I think he may have gone to the galley to make . himself something to eat and the lacerations on his face and legs lead . me to believe he was bending over a gas canister. 'If someone had killed him onboard, he wouldn't have been able to try and deploy his life raft. 'I have been living in Caribbean for long time and have helped rescue people in severe floods. 'When . you attend you expect to help people. If you do encounter someone that . you are unable to help, one thing that makes it more tolerable, was at . least we were able to uncover Mr Garner's body for his family. ' A sailing friend in Norway, where Mr Garner has lived for many years, . said the divorced grandfather was ultra-fit and previously worked as a physical trainer for British special forces. Mr Garner's yacht, Asante, was found floating about 15 nautical miles off the coast of St. Vincent . He had previously divorced from a Norwegian woman and had several children and grandchildren, the source said. The friend said: ‘It is very shocking . news. He was a very nice man. He loved his yacht, Asante, and he was . meticulous about the way he kept it. He had a military attitude towards . things and was a strict sailing instructor. ‘He . is what you would call an English gentleman. He trained the special . forces in Britain, the SAS I believe, although he was a civilian and did . not have a rank. ‘He . loved sailing and I know Heidi went with him sometimes, although I . never met her. He was often in the Caribbean and would then come back to . Norway, where he had a house.’ The friend said they had previously spoken to Mr Garner about the dangers of travelling to St Vincent. ‘Me . and John spoke about St Vincent many times. In the yachting society, St . Vincent is somewhere you sailed straight past and did not stop at. ‘It was not a safe place, it was a place to avoid. People were worried about thefts and robberies and rapes. ‘Boat . boys would try to help you to anchor, when you did not need help, and . then charge you money. You paid them because you feared they would come . back at night time. ‘I told John this but he would say that it was okay and that he did not have a problem with them. ’Yesterday, pictures emerged of the burning boat, with plumes of black smoke billowing out. The . yacht, called Asante, was found floating about 15 nautical miles off . the beautiful coastal resort of Buccament, south-west of the island, . which boasts several five-star hotels. Police said Mr Garner and Miss Hukkelaas had recently been granted permission to extend their stay on the island until April 19. The Asante was is described as 'a large ocean-going yacht of 49 feet and very pretty' with four sleeping cabins . A file picture of the Asante. Mr  Garner's body was found on board a partly burnt raft at sea on Wednesday . Mr Garner had previously advertised sailing trips around the British Virgin Islands for between £5,500 and £9,000. The . online advertisement offers a journey around a ‘beautiful area’ and . lessons in navigation, boat handling and overboard practice, among other . kills. It states: ‘The instructor of Asante, John Edward Garner is Norwegian / English and he is also the owner of the boat. ‘Skipper . and instructor John at Asante is a graduate of the English Yachtmaster . system and Yachtmaster Ocean from England, and has sailed far.’ The boat is described as ‘a large ocean-going yacht of 49 feet and very pretty’ with four sleeping cabins. The course was described as suitable for beginners and adheres to ‘British Royal Yachting Association’s rules’. The . murder comes just two months after retired management consultant Roger . Pratt, 62, was murdered and his wife Margaret, 60, injured when robbers . attacked their yacht as it lay moored off the Caribbean island of St . Lucia. The couple, from . Warwickshire, had been on a dream voyage around the world on their . £200,000 yacht, when they were ambushed at the port of Vieux Fort, at . night. Four men have been charged with Mr Pratt’s murder and theft and are awaiting trial.

"By . John Hall . A judge has accused prosecutors of sparking a 'serious miscarriage of justice' after he was unable to give two violent thugs the longer prison sentences he says they deserve. Judge Nicholas Coleman made the comments while sentencing Ricky Fuller, 29, and Aaron Ellwood, 31, at Norwich Crown Court yesterday, after they admitted smashing the jaw of tattoo artist Dan Tidd. Judge Coleman branded the prosecution's decision to accept lesser pleas than the original GBH with intent charges 'manifestly flawed', when they dramatically reduced the sentences he could deliver. Anger: Judge Nicholas Coleman (left) branded the prosecution's decision to accept lesser pleas 'manifestly flawed' after two men admitted smashing the jaw of tattoo artist Dan Tidd (right) Violent ex-soldier Fuller and his friend Ellwood ambushed . Ben Gillard and Andrew Richardson as they went to get a taxi after closing time at the Rampant Horse Pub in Fakenham in Norfolk in February 2012. Mr Gillard and Mr Richardson were both knocked out cold with punches to the head, and were then kicked as they lay on the ground. Mr Tidd, who worked with Mr Gillard at 4Skin Tattooing in Fakenham, chased the thugs away but Fuller turned and attacked him in an alley, smashing the 31-year-old's jaw in two places. He needed extensive facial reconstruction surgery after the attack. Fuller and Ellwood were originally charged with grievous bodily harm with intent, which can carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. But prosecutors later accepted Fuller's lesser plea of GBH without intent, which carries a maximum five year sentence. They also accepted Ellwood's plea of affray, which is capped at just three years. Judge Coleman jailed father-of-two Fuller for three years and father-of-three Ellwood for 18 months. Ricky Fuller (right) and Aaron Ellwood (left) were originally charged with GBH with intent, which can carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. But they had respective pleas of GBH without intent and affray accepted . After sentencing, he said: 'I go as far as to say that this misjudgement in the prosecutorial process I believe has led to a serious miscarriage of justice in that two men who should have been tried for causing GBH with intent were allowed to plead guilty to lesser charges which did not reflect their culpability.' But Frank Ferguson, deputy chief crown prosecutor for the CPS East of England, last night denied there had been any 'misjudgement'. He said he would be writing to Judge Coleman about his comments. Mr Ferguson said the pleas had been considered carefully and discussed with the victims before they were accepted. The crime that Fuller and Ellwood were originally charged with - wounding or causing grievous bodily harm with intent - carries a maximum penalty of life in prison. The 'intent' element is the key factor in this case and relies on whether or not the perpetrators deliberately caused severe harm. GBH with intent requires the perpetrator to have set out to cause their victim severe injuries, and therefore falls under Section 18 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861. The maximum sentence for GBH with intent is life imprisonment, but there are three categories within the sentencing guidelines that allow for reduced term depending on the injuries caused or the perpetrator's culpability. GBH without intent is considered a far less serious charge and falls under Section 20 of of the Offences against the Person Act 1861. It is used when a person has caused their victim serious injuries, but the extent of those injuries was not intended. Again the charge is split into various categories depending on harm and culpability, but even at its most serious level, the maximum sentence for the crime of five years. Affray - the charge Ellwood pleaded guilty to - is a public order offence with a maximum sentence of just three years. The attack took place after an argument over whose turn it was to use the pool table at the Rampant Horse Pub. Fuller and Ellwood later attacked Mr Gillard and Mr Richardson outside the pub, before Mr Tidd attempted to come to their aid and had his jaw broken. Lori Tucker, prosecuting, said Mr Tidd had had difficulty sleeping and his social life had deteriorated since he'd been savagely beaten up. She said he had not been able to return to Fakenham since the incident. The case was seriously delayed when prosecutors decided to pursue charges against a third man - Robbie Smith - after accepting evidence from Fuller and Ellwood. Mr Smith was later cleared of all charges by a jury. Speaking of Fuller and Ellwood’s evidence, Judge Coleman said: 'I positively disbelieve what both of you said on oath.' He questioned why prosecutors had accepted the evidence against Mr Smith when the co-defendants had a clear 'self-serving interest' and had not made written statements to police. Michael Clare, defending for Fuller, said he was a 'hard-working' scaffolder who had served in Iraq and Kosovo with the army. Mr Clare said Fuller had a wife, an eight-year-old son and three-year-old daughter and the two-year wait before sentence had already punished them all. 'He has the mental wherewithal to deal with this, but he’s extremely concerned about how his wife will deal with this,' Mr Clare added. Scene: The attack on Ben Gillard, Andrew Richardson and Dan Tidd took place after an argument over whose turn it was to use the pool table at the Rampant Horse Pub in Fakenham, Norfolk . Jonathan Goodman, defending for Ellwood, said he had a family and three children. He’d separated from his wife but is expecting a child with a new partner. Mr Goodman described the attack as an 'isolated incident'. Sentencing, Judge Coleman told the two men: 'Mr Richardson and Mr Gillard were trying to get a taxi home with their friends and you both attacked them.' 'You were both engaged in the attack that involved punching and kicking and kicking when they were both rendered unconscious.' He branded the incident 'serious violence', and said that although Ellwood was not sentenced for the attack on Mr Tidd, the affray was 'as bad a case as you can see'. Ben Tidd (pictured) says has had difficulty sleeping since being savagely beaten up by Fuller and Ellwood . Judge Coleman said that if the pair end up qualifying for early release, they would both be banned from all pubs in Fakenham while on licence. He also gave the men a three-year exclusion order from the Rampant Horse pub. Last night Mr Tidd said he was 'gutted' that Fuller and Ellwood had not been jailed for longer. 'For the trouble it’s caused me, the sleepless nights, the paranoia, I would prefer it if he [Fuller] went away for a little bit longer.' 'But I’m happy it’s over with and everyone can just go back to normality. The whole process has been quite draining. 'If you had asked me a year ago I think I would have been a bit angrier. I’m smiling today as I know it’s over now.' Frank Ferguson, deputy chief crown prosecutor for the CPS East of England, said after the case: 'We are satisfied that the acceptance of the offer of pleas was correct and proper in the particular circumstances of this case and there has not been any misjudgement on the part of the prosecution. 'This was a case where we were offered pleas to affray by Aaron Ellwood and Ricky Fuller and also, in Fuller’s case, to actual bodily harm and grievous bodily harm. 'There were difficulties in relation to the evidence against these two defendants which we considered most carefully before deciding to accept the pleas. 'We discussed the pleas with the victims beforehand who indicated they were happy with the decision to accept them.” He added: 'The pleas were also accepted by a different judge at an earlier hearing who shared the prosecution’s concerns about the evidence.' 'The case proceeded against a third defendant, Robbie Smith, who pleaded not guilty to affray and grievous bodily harm with intent and was acquitted after full jury trial.' 'At the sentencing hearing, as part of the outline of the case, counsel said that the pleas by both men included their involvement in punching and kicking the victims' 'Our view was that the basis of plea did show their involvement in the assaults against the victims and gave the court adequate sentencing powers' 'We will be writing to Judge Coleman regarding his comments.'","Judge Nicholas Coleman is angry at charges the prosecution accepted .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . The San Diego Zoo says an infant gorilla that was successfully treated for pneumonia after a cesarean section delivery is in her mother's arms for the first time. Zoo officials say the 12-day-old female was physically introduced to her mother, Imani, for the first time Monday morning. Since then the 18-year-old Imani has been constantly cradling and carrying her baby. The new mom began nursing 3 hours after meeting the baby. Zoo staff will monitor the baby to make sure that the newborn gorilla receives enough nutrition. Scroll down for video . Cute: In this photo taken on Monday, March 24, 2014, and provided by the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, a 12-day old baby gorilla is physically introduced to her mother, Imani, for the first time at the San Diego Zoo . Bottle fed: The baby, shown here Wednesday, March 19, was delivered by a rare emergency cesarean section and has been receiving round-the-clock care . Nadine Lamberski, associate director of veterinary services at the park, said last week the unnamed gorilla is developing quickly and normally after undergoing surgery for a collapsed lung. The gorilla was delivered March 12 at the zoo's Safari Park via emergency C-section. After about 10 weeks of around-the-clock care, keepers at San Diego Safari Park introduced the adorable newborn to her gorilla family on Friday though a cage. Their first hug was Monday.

The little gorilla weighed just 4lbs 6oz when she was born with breathing problems on March 12. Her mother had been in labor for 12 hours  - a normal stretch for human moms-to-be, but rare for gorillas. 'With gorillas, that’s very unusual,' zoo spokeswoman Christina Simmons told ABCNews.com.

"By . Daniel Martin . UPDATED: . 19:33 EST, 17 February 2012 . David Cameron attempted to smooth relations with Nicolas Sarkozy yesterday by effusively backing his campaign to retain the French presidency. At a kiss-and-make-up summit in Paris, the pair swapped compliments after weeks of strained relations following Mr Cameron’s decision to veto the European treaty on dealing with the financial crisis. At the time, Mr Sarkozy castigated him for the move and publicly snubbed his handshake at a summit. But yesterday it was all smiles as he claimed he might have used the veto himself had he been British prime minister needing to defend the City. Scroll down for video . Rapprochement: Weeks after his handshake was refused, David Cameron reaches out to President Sarkozy in Paris . Mon ami: The president clutches the Prime Minister's sleeve in the press conference at the Elysee to mark a landmark agreement to cooperate on civil nuclear energy . The pair met on the anniversary of the war in Libya in an attempt to rekindle the close alliance they forged during that conflict by stepping up support for rebels now seeking to oust Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad. They agreed the world was not doing enough to help rebels in Syria, and revealed the two countries were working together on ways to give assistance to the opposition. Beside Mr Sarkozy at a press conference in the Elysee Palace, Mr Cameron said: ‘I don’t think that there has been closer French-British co-operation at any time since the Second World War, not just in Libya but also on the vital issues of Syria, Iran, Somalia and defence co-operation.’ President Sarkozy is trailing his socialist rival Francois Hollande by a wide margin in the polls. It means the PM’s vocal backing could be risky – alienating the likely winner. Entente cordiale: The two leaders depart arm-in-arm - and Mr Cameron backs Mr Sarkozy to be re-elected as president . ‘This summit has given me the chance to . wish my friend well in the battle he has ahead,’ said the Prime . Minister. ‘I admire Nicolas Sarkozy’s leadership and courage and I think . he’s achieved great things with his country.’ The Prime Minister paid warm tribute to his host’s role in the diplomatic and military effort to defend the Libyan people against the Gaddafi regime, saying he was ‘absolutely convinced that, were it not for his leadership, we would not have now in Libya people who are free to choose their own future’. And he added: ‘I believe it is a relationship that is easily strong enough to survive the odd bump or bounce that we sometimes have when we have a disagreement. That is what politicians do and it is what friends do as well.’ Landmark: French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Prime Minister David Cameron shake hands at the Elysee Palace in Paris ahead of a deal to cooperate over nuclear power . The president returned the compliments, praising Mr Cameron as ‘a brave man’, and insisting there were ‘more convergences than divergences’ between the two. He said he wanted to ensure that euro members take account of the UK’s concerns over the impact of greater financial co-ordination on the EU’s single market, while Britain would show more understanding for the eurozone’s need to act swiftly to resolve its problems. ‘I have always been of the view that Europe needs Britain, and, together with David Cameron, we are putting together working methods whereby we are going to understand one another’s red lines and come up with a greater degree of convergence,’ said Mr Sarkozy. ‘We have had divergences of views but perhaps had I been in David Cameron’s position I would have defended Britain’s interests in exactly the same manner he has. ‘What I can tell you is that there has never been a personal opposition between us. A head of state is there precisely to defend the interests of his nation, to lead others to understand how vital those interests are.’ The Prime Minister and President Sarkozy unveiled a £500million deal to step up nuclear co-operation. The two countries will work together to build nuclear plants, creating 1,500 British jobs, says Downing Street. Rolls-Royce and the French firms EDF and Areva will sign contracts to begin building the first in a new generation of power stations at Hinkley Point in Somerset. The deal will see ministers and businesses in the UK and France work closely together on research and development and with the International Atomic Energy Authority to improve global ability to fight nuclear disasters like Fukushima in Japan. Plans: The deal would see the first of a new generation of nuclear power stations built at Hinkley Point, creating more than 1,500 jobs . Civil nuclear energy agreement worth more than £500million for parts and construction work on new nuclear power plant in Hinkley Point, Somerset, and training facility in Bridgwater. Proposal for new pilotless military drone capable of more precision strikes will advance to procurement stage and will involve Britain's BAE. Plans for joint command and control centre for future military operations will be accelerated. Two leaders will also discuss options for offering support to rebels within Syria - although military intervention not a suggestion. Mr Cameron said: ‘Today’s summit shows the strength and depth of Britain’s ties with France. ‘As two great civil nuclear nations, we will combine our expertise to strengthen industrial partnership, improve nuclear safety and create jobs at home.’ Rolls-Royce is to open a factory in Rotherham to produce components for the plant at Hinkley Point as part of a £400million deal with the French energy giant Areva, supporting 600 jobs in the company and 600 in its supply chain. Meanwhile, EDF will conclude a £100million agreement with Keir/BAM Nuttall for the first construction works at Hinkley Point and will set up a £15million training campus for future nuclear engineers in nearby Bridgwater. The two countries will also work closely on nuclear defence, swapping the ‘most sensitive dossiers’, the Prime Minister said. He added: ‘At our last summit, we . signed a historic partnership on defence. Today, we will match that . ambition on nuclear energy.’ The deal has been signed against a . confusing backdrop in the UK. Recently departed Energy Secretary Chris . Huhne said he was in favour of new nuclear plants only if they were . funded by the private sector. His . successor in the Cabinet, fellow Liberal Democrat Ed Davey, once . opposed a new generation of nuclear power stations which he said would . cost taxpayers tens of billions of pounds. Brand: Mr Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg next to a Mini at the Gare du Nord station as part of the Visit Great Britain campaign . In 2006, Mr Davey said: ‘In addition to posing safety and environmental risks, nuclear power will only be possible with vast taxpayer subsidies or a rigged market.’ But after succeeding Mr Huhne he said he would not oppose the construction of new plants, again so long as they are not subsidised by the taxpayer. In 2006, as leader of the Opposition, David Cameron was pictured on a sled in Norway to prove his commitment to a green agenda. In a subsequent article about energy policy for The Independent he failed to mention the word nuclear once. David Cameron’s nuclear love-in with . Nicolas Sarkozy is no more than a rerun of a similar event at 10 Downing . Street when Gordon Brown sold off state-owned British Energy to the . state-controlled French power giant EDF in 2009. As . part of the deal Downing Street encouraged Centrica, owner of British . Gas, to take a 20 per cent stake in British Energy in an effort to . demonstrate that the UK was still very much involved in new nuclear . development. Similarly, . this time around the Coalition Government – which has never been . particularly enthusiastic about nuclear power – has managed to give the . contracts signed in Paris a British tinge by ensuring that Rolls-Royce . is among the sub-contractors with £400million of work. Entente: The two had endured a more frosty reception in recent months after Mr Cameron refused to back an EU treaty to stabilise the euro . Yesterday Downing Street was anxious . to play up the benefits for Britain, claiming the new facilities will . create 1,500 jobs. But the reality is that if and when the . super-powerful nuclear plants are built the main beneficiaries will be . the leading French engineers Areva, who are in charge of the design, . licensing and commissioning, and EDF, one of the biggest developers of . nuclear power across the globe. A lack of courage and series of . mistakes by successive governments has meant that Britain’s home-grown . expertise in the nuclear industry – which made it a pioneer in the 1960s . and 1970s – has been dissipated and the field left to the French. The . Blair-Brown government finally put paid to our ambitions to be a leader . in nuclear technology when state-owned British Nuclear Fuels sold off . Westinghouse, the world’s leading expert on pressurised nuclear . reactors, to Toshiba of Japan in 2006 for £3.5billion. In the run-up to the 2007 election . New Labour had made it clear that it wanted nothing to do with nuclear . energy and intended to pursue a renewables agenda. That rapidly changed . when it became clear that Britain would be left almost entirely . dependent on imported natural gas supplies over the next decade or so . unless it adopted a nuclear strategy. And EDF has had difficulties with a new build in its own backyard in Brittany. If . EDF is to become engaged it will require a huge subsidy from consumers. The Government will have to guarantee EDF a ‘base price’ for the energy . it produces. Because of the enormous capital costs of the project it . will be far higher than the market price for power produced by natural . gas. In addition the . consumer will also have to pay for a £200billion refurbishment of the . National Grid so it has sufficient capacity to carry the power surge . from the new nuclear plants. Households . in Britain already are struggling to pay their utility bills. But with . the advent of new nuclear we will place ourselves in hock to overseas . interests and the bills will be even higher.","Prime Minister: 'I don't think there has been closer French-British co-operation at any time since the Second World War'

"By . Laura Williamson . and Sami Mokbel . Bacary Sagna has been offered a massive £4.1million per season after tax to join Galatasaray in the summer. The Arsenal right back is out of contract at the end of the season and is yet to agree an extension on his current £3.6m deal. Sagna is free to begin talks with foreign clubs regarding a potential free transfer and the Turkish giants have been quick to register their interest. Comfort cash: Sagna has been offered a huge £4.1million per season after tax to join Galatasaray . Stay or go? Manager Arsene Wenger talks with defender Sagna before a training last week . They hope to lure Sagna with the security of a four-year contract and a huge pay rise. The France defender, 30, who is also interesting Fenerbahce, Paris St-Germain and Monaco, has been involved in a long- running contract wrangle with the Gunners. The club’s original offer of a 12- month extension, on the same salary, was dismissed last season. Arsenal have returned with a new offer of a two-year extension, again on the same money, but there remains a reluctance to agree to those terms. Manager Arsene Wenger has spoken of his desire to tie Sagna down to a new contract. Wenger also said Theo Walcott will miss the World Cup but will come back stronger than ever. Mainstay: Sagna is still a regular for Arsenal, and has played 17 league games this term for the Gunners . Wenger said it was ‘unbelievable’ that Walcott picked up a knee injury in a World Cup year after being called up by England prematurely in 2006 and then left out of Fabio Capello’s 2010 squad, but believes it will not cost the player any of his pace. Wenger insisted the 24-year-old is young enough to recover fully from the injury sustained in Arsenal’s FA Cup win over Tottenham last week, but ruled out trying to rush him back in time for the World Cup in Brazil. ‘I’m convinced (Walcott can come back from this),’ said Wenger. ‘Studies show that the players around 25 with that kind of injury come back as normal. When you are over 30, you do not ever come back exactly the same. But between 25 and 28 you come back to the level you had before. Friends: Sagna would be joining former Chelsea star Didier Drogba (right) at the Istanbul-based club . ‘He has said to me he is under shock but he will fight as ever to come back. He is strong mentally and, if you look at his career, he has had a few setbacks. ‘To go, at 17, to a World Cup and afterwards to be left out in South Africa was a massive blow and he always recovered. ‘He went to the World Cup when he was not ready to go and, when he was ready to go, he was not selected. Then, the first time when nobody disputes that he will go, he is out through injury. Desperate: Arsenal boss Wenger has spoken of his desire to tie down Sagna on a new contract . ‘There are always people who make miracles but on cruciates we know that the minimum time is six months.’ Wenger is also confident Lukas Podolski and Olivier Giroud can compensate for Walcott’s absence, but would not rule out venturing into the transfer market this month. One man who won’t be leaving is Tomas Rosicky. Wenger said: ‘Rosicky will stay here at the end of the season. He is a marvellous player and contributes well to the team.’","Frenchman is out of contract in the summer, currently on £3.6m per year .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . When a transplant patient receives the call saying a long-awaited donor organ is ready, there can be a mad rush to get it on ice and on the move ready for the operation. To reduce the stress, and expense, involved in such operations, a team of medical scientists have created the Organ Care System - a box designed to keep organs alive outside the human body. Surgeons in Phoenix recently used the system to successfully transplant a lung, but the machine can also maintain hearts, kidneys and livers, according to reports in Al Jazeera America. The OCS was created by . Massachusetts-based firm TransMedics and the system has been designed to . simulate conditions of the human body as close as possible. As well as keeping lungs breathing, pictured, the system can also make hearts beat, help kidneys produce urine and livers produce bile . The OCS was created by Massachusetts-based firm TransMedics and the system has been designed to simulate conditions of the human body as close as possible. As well as monitoring temperature, the system can make hearts beat, help kidneys produce urine and livers produce bile. Donor blood is pumped through the organs, and the system can manage blood oxygenation and flow using an internal gas supply and pumping system. It can also maintain humidity, protect the organ from contamination, and replenish any depleted nutrients missing from the blood and organ. The recent OCS lung transplant was carried out by doctors and surgeons at the Heart and Lung Institute at St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Centre, in Phoenix. Patient Victoria Bloomfield only had 30% lung capacity, diseased lung pictured right, and needed a replacement, pictured left . The transplant lung was kept in the OCS for more than 24 hours and the surgery took four hours to complete. Traditionally, a lung can be preserved for between five hours and nine hours on ice. Hearts last for even less time, between three and eight hours. Other organ preservation times are shown on this graph . The recent OCS lung transplant was carried out by doctors and surgeons at the Heart and Lung Institute at St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Centre, in Phoenix. Patient Victoria Bloomfield only had 30 per cent lung capacity due to disease and needed a replacement. The transplant lung was kept in the OCS until the surgeons were ready, and the surgery took four hours to complete. During which time, the organ was protected with a cool solution during the implant. Traditionally, a lung can be preserved for between five hours and nine hours on ice. Hearts last for even less time, between three and eight hours. The longest a heart and lung has been kept on the system has been between 10 and 11 hours but the firm said organs can be kept in the OCS for longer. The Organ Care System (OCS) is designed to keep organs warm and in state where they can function outside of the body – either while waiting for a transplant to take place, or during clinical tests. The system can make hearts beat, lungs breathe, help kidneys produce urine and livers produce bile. It was created by Massachussets-based firm TransMedics and the system has been designed to simulate conditions of the human body as close as possible. OCS connects to wireless monitor, an organ specific perfusion module, and specially-designed solutions for looking after organs. Donor blood is pumped through the organs, and the system can manage blood oxygenation and flow using an internal gas supply and pulsatile pumping system. It can also maintain humidity, protect the organ from contamination, and replenish any depleted nutrients missing from the blood and organ. The OCS makes it possible to keep these vital organs alive and transplant-ready for much longer. Journalist Shini Somara from Al Jazeera America witnessed the transplant and said: ‘The sound of the lungs mechanically breathing was surreal, and we followed these previous organs back to the operating room. Once surgeons were ready to make the swap, they held Victoria's old lung and new lung side by side. Victoria’s old lung was tiny frail and full of ugly black carbon deposits, while her new donor lung was large, pink and fluffy.' A spokesman for TransMedic told MailOnline the heart and lung system are both in use in the UK at Harefield and Papworth hospitals. TransMedic plan to bring the liver system to the market later this year.","The Organ Care System (OCS) was created by U.S firm TransMedics .

"By . Martin Robinson . A judge who allowed a paedophile to walk free in a case where the 13-year-old victim was described as a 'predator' was forced to alter his sentence today, but still failed to jail him or apologise. Neil Wilson, 41, was given a suspended sentence last week after Judge Nigel Peters QC said the child may have looked and acted older than her years. The judge today called back Wilson because his sentence contained an error and added four months to his initial eight months in jail, still suspended for two years. But separate to this the Attorney General's office has confirmed it is still investigating if this is too lenient, and will come to a decision in the next 21 days. Under fire: Judge Nigel Peters is being investigated for suggesting the victim was 'egging on' paedophile Neil Wilson, and today he was forced to change his sentence because of a technicality but still failed to jail him . The case caused controversy  when . Robert Colover, the barrister prosecuting in the case, had labelled the . young girl 'predatory' and 'sexually experienced' and has been suspended . from similar cases. Judge Peters then repeated his comments and is also being . investigated for telling Wilson the girl was ‘egging you on’. The CPS described Mr Colover's remarks as 'inappropriate' and suspended him from prosecuting sexual offence cases pending a review. Judge Peters is currently being investigated by the judicial watchdog and this morning decided to extend the sentence to 12 months after ruling two counts of possessing indecent images, for which Wilson was given four months imprisonment suspended for two years, should run consecutively. He made no reference to the storm surrounding the case during the 10-minute hearing. Explaining the decision to Wilson, who appeared via videolink from York Magistrates' Court, the judge told him: 'I have had the matter listed before me today as part of the sentence, not that part relating to sexual activity with a child, requires correcting. 'It was not appreciated by the parties that I could not pass a community order with a supervision requirement for three years to run alongside a suspended sentence on the same indictment or indeed another indictment sentenced on the same occasion. 'In amending the sentence I have sought to ensure that all parts of the order will be complied with by the defendant and that any breach will be brought before a court and consideration given to further penalty, including immediate imprisonment.' 'Disgrace': Barrister Robert Colover has been criticised by campaigners for describing a 13-year-old victim of a sex abuse case 'predatory' and was replaced at today's hearing . David Cameron had condemned a prosecution barrister and had urged the courts to ‘stand up for  victims’ after Neil Wilson, 41, escaped jail despite luring the girl to his home, where she performed a sex act on him. 'It isn’t appropriate. We need a . criminal justice system that stands up properly for victims. The victims . should always be at the centre of our thinking. ‘The . CPS themselves have said that this isn’t appropriate, the Attorney . General is going to look into the case and we need a system that . properly stands up for victims.’ Child protection campaigners labelled barrister Robert Colover a ‘disgrace’ and called for his dismissal. They also warned that his ‘crass’ comments would stop other young abuse victims from coming forward. Mr Colover has been suspended from prosecuting sex trials after he told Snaresbrook Crown Court in London that the girl ‘forced’ herself on Wilson, describing her as ‘predatory in all her actions’ and ‘sexually experienced’. He said: ‘She appeared to look around 14 or 15 and had the mental age of a 14 or 15-year-old. There was sexual activity but it was not of Mr Wilson’s doing. ‘You might say it was forced upon him despite his being older and stronger than her.’ Wilson admitted two counts of making extreme pornographic images and one count of sexual activity with a child. His own solicitor told Monday’s sentencing hearing that the paedophile could still pose a risk to children. Marilyn Hawes, director of child protection charity Enough Abuse, said: ‘This needs to be nipped in the bud. Are we in 1913 or 2013? Judges and barristers should be removed if they use language like this. ‘Vulnerable witnesses won’t come forward if they are going to be treated this way in court. They are fragile children, they are not just pieces of evidence to be used in a case.' Emily Thornberry, Labour’s Shadow Attorney General, said: ‘It is appalling that after the scandals of Jimmy Savile and Rochdale these awful Lolita prejudices are still being served up in court, and by the prosecution of all people.’ She has written to the Bar Standards Board to examine whether Mr Colover violated its code of conduct. Investigation: The Crown Prosecution Service has launched a probe following the case at Snaresbrook Crown Court, which returned there this morning . Charity Victim Support also condemned the teenager’s treatment. Its chief executive Javed Khan said: ‘It is completely unacceptable for victims to be blamed in any way for the abuse they have suffered. ‘The state owes a duty of care to victims and witnesses, which in this case appears to have been woefully neglected. We have strenuously campaigned for cultural change to this often adversarial, aggressive courts system.’ There was further anger as a high profile human rights lawyer appeared to defend the prosecutor’s comments. Barbara Hewson, a barrister for Hardwicke Chambers, tweeted: ‘It takes two to tango. Disgusting tho’ these men are, frankly the girls are often not much better – and no shrieking martyrs.’ The CPS said: ‘The word predatory in this context should not have been used and is of real concern to the CPS. The Director of Public Prosecutions will be undertaking a review of this case to determine what happened and to decide what action needs to be taken. The Attorney General’s Office said the case had been drawn to its attention ‘as a possibly unduly lenient sentence’. The Office for Judicial Complaints said it would consider a number of complaints it had received . Shock: Wilson's crimes led to a suspended sentence where the girl victim was accused of egging him on (posed by model) Neil Wilson spotted his victim amid the bustle of Romford town centre at the start of March last year. The 13-year-old girl was playing truant from school and wandering the streets asking strangers for cigarettes. Wilson . obliged when she asked him – offering her an entire packet. He then . took her back to his flat near the town centre for coffee. The girl allegedly looked around 14 or 15 and acted as if she was older than her years. However, she was clearly underage – and nearly three decades younger than Wilson who was 39 at the time. Over the next two weeks the pair enjoyed a brief ‘fling’, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. The . girl was described by the prosecutor and judge as a ‘sexual predator’. But during this time it was Wilson who bombarded her with phone calls . and text messages as she continued to visit his home, the court heard. On . March 20, exactly two weeks after her first visit, the girl went back . to Wilson’s flat after they agreed to meet. They sat in his lounge and . talked about their relationship. Wilson claims at this point he told her they had to stop seeing each other because they would get in trouble. The . girl, who was dressed in her school uniform, asked if she could change . out of it and Wilson left the room. When he returned she had undressed . and was sat wearing a T-shirt. Wilson . claims he asked her to put her clothes on, but she started kissing him . before touching his genitals. He said he pushed her away and told her he . did not want to see her any more. At no point did they have sex. Robert . Colover, prosecuting, told the court that the sexual activity was ‘not . of Mr Wilson’s doing’. He added: ‘You might say it was forced upon him . despite being older and stronger than her.’ The abuse came to light only when the girl told a friend what happened and the police were called. When officers went to Wilson’s home, they found images of child sexual abuse and videos depicting bestiality on his computer. Four . of the images were surreptitiously taken photographs of children in . play areas or other safe environments showing either underwear or . varying degrees of nakedness. There were also 11 sexually explicit images involving horses and dogs. Wilson told police that he watched hardcore pornography but that he had deleted it from his computer.","Neil Wilson handed an 8 month jail term suspended for 2 years last week .

"By . Ruth Styles . The First World War saw millions of men separated from their families and sent to the front line but very few were pitted against their relations. For the royals, however, World War I truly was a family affair. A new documentary has revealed how the roots of the Great War lay partly in the tangled web of Royal family relationships - in particular that of the British-hating Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany and his cousins, George V and Tsar Nicholas of Russia. Best of enemies: Kaiser Wilhelm II (L) and King Edward VII loathed each other despite being nephew and uncle . Wilhelm, the eldest of the three and the owner of a withered arm thanks to his traumatic birth, was notoriously difficult and had a strained relationship with his English mother, Victoria or 'Vicky' as she was known to friends and family. In the BBC documentary, Royal Cousins at War, the story of how the young Wilhelm's hatred of his parents, and all things Biritsh, in part, brought about the beginning of the First World War is told. His mother Vicky was only 17 when she married Prussia’s dashing Crown Prince Friedrich, known as Fritz, in 1858. It was a passionate love match that also fulfilled the dynastic dreams of her German father Prince Albert. But her first pregnancy almost ended in disaster, after she underwent a traumatic breech delivery. A Caesarean – too dangerous at the time – was out of the question and the future Kaiser Wilhelm II had to be wrenched forcefully into the world. Three days later, a nursemaid noticed that his damaged left arm hung limply at his side - much to his mother's horror. 'It cuts me to the heart when I see all . other children with the use of all their limbs and that mine is denied . that,' she wrote in an anguished letter to her mother. 'The thought of him remaining a cripple haunts me. I long to have a . child where everything is perfect about it just like everybody else.' Family feud: George V (pictured front centre) was no more keen on Kaiser Wilhelm than his father had been . Mothers: Princess Victoria, mother of Kaiser Wilhelm (L) and Tsarina Dagmar and Queen Alexandra (R) 'This is the story of a proud mother who reacts really badly to her . son's handicap,' explains Dr Karina Urbach of the University of London. 'She tries to love him and tries to be a good mother but . at the end of the day, she looks at him and sees a failure.' By contrast, Wilhelm's cousins, the future Tsar Nicholas and George V, were adored by their mothers, Alexandra and Dagmar - a pair of Danish royal sisters who married into two of Europe's most powerful dynasties. Theirs was a shared childhood with summers spent enjoying family breaks in Denmark at the home of their grandfather, Christian IX. Both were taught to mistrust the Prussians - later Germans - by their mothers, furious at Germany's annexation of Schleswig-Holstein, formerly a Danish possession, in 1864. Both were also in awe of their fathers, Edward VII and Tsar Alexander III, and became fast friends as a result. Childhood: Tsar Nicholas II and George V met during family holidays in Denmark and remained close friends . Firm friends: Tsar Nicholas II and King George V were cousins and close friends thanks to their mothers . Alexandra, pictured with Edward VII and their son Albert, hated Germany after its conquest of parts of Denmark . Peacemaker: Queen Victoria, pictured with Kaiser Wilhelm, his mother and Edward VII kept the family united . Wilhelm, however, proved less than popular with his British and Russian extended family; not least because of the treatment he meted out to his mother. As a teenager, he wrote strange  - almost sexually charged - letters to his mother Princess Victoria in which he described dreams of kissing . her hands and caressing her. 'Promise to do to me as I did in my dream to you. I love you so much,' the future German monarch wrote in one epistle. But when she replied speaking only of art and politics, the already tortured relationship continued to worsen. And when his father died in March 1888, his behaviour towards his mother was so shocking, it damaged relations with his uncle Edward VII forever. Upon becoming Kaiser, Wilhelm's first . act was to have troops to surround the palace where his father died on the pretext of searching for . for papers relating to his father's reign. But his ire was really directed at his mother, as her furious brother was only too well aware. At odds: In contrast to his close relationship with George V, Nicholas II found Kaiser Wilhelm difficult . Troubled: Kaiser Wilhelm (pictured aged 4 at Balmoral and later in Berlin) had an unhappy childhood . Not close: Although related twice over, Tsar Nicholas II and Kaiser Wilhelm were not close friends . In a letter written to his sister shortly after her husband's death, Edward wrote: 'His conduct towards you is simply revolting. His manners are not those of a gentleman.' But the family feuding came at a price: as relationships between the royal cousins waxed and waned, so did the relationships between their countries. Aware of the dangerous possibilities, one woman did attempt to broker peace: Queen Victoria, the family matriarch. Respected and listened to by all, even by her notoriously unstable . grandson Wilhelm, the British Empress played peacemaker and ensured her . family - and their respective nations - maintained good relationships. Family: Like George V, Nicholas II was devoted to his wife, a favourite grandchild of Queen Victoria . Tragedy: George V and Nicholas II remained close after their respective enthronements and until the end . Wilhelm, in particular, adored her. But it couldn't last. In 1901, when it became clear she was dying, the Kaiser rushed to be with her. When she died, it was in his arms and he helped to lay out her body. At her funeral, he rode behind her casket alongside his uncle Edward VII. But with Victoria gone, peace between the Russian, British and German branches of the family dissipated and Europe edged closer to war: George V and Tsar Nicholas on one side, and their estranged cousin, Wilhelm, on the other.

"By . John Hall . Insulin use in the UK has trebled over the last 20 years, driven by high rates of obesity-linked type 2 diabetes, according to a new study. Experts analysed data from patient prescriptions to find a huge increase between 1991 and 2010 in the use of insulin, particularly among people with type 2, which is linked to unhealthy lifestyles. The number of people using insulin overall trebled from 136,800 in 1991 to 421,300 in 2010. Rocketing: Insulin use in the UK has trebled over the last 20 years, driven by high rates of obesity-linked type 2 diabetes which is generally linked to people with unhealthy lifestyles . For those with type 2 diabetes, the number using insulin rocketed almost eight-fold from 37,000 in 1991 to 277,400 in 2010. In 1991, more people using insulin had type 1 diabetes than had type 2 diabetes (98,400 versus 37,000), the research also found. By 2010, this situation had reversed, and 134,900 had type 1 while 277,400 had type 2 diabetes. The study was published in the Journal of Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism and was led by a team of academics from Cardiff University and the University of Bristol. Rising: The number of people using insulin has trebled from 136,800 in 1991 to 421,300 in 2010 . The researchers said the financial cost to the NHS of insulin use increased from £156 million in 2000 to £359 million in 2009. They blamed more expensive types of insulin but also the huge demand for insulin from people with type 2. In England alone, the total cost of all medicines used to treat diabetes increased from £573.9 million to £725.1 million between 2005/6 and 2009/10, they added. Craig Currie, professor of applied pharmacoepidemiology at Cardiff University's School of Medicine, said: 'As a result of the study, we found that the number of people injecting insulin in the UK increased three-fold over the 20-year period from 1991 to 2010. 'Also during this period there was more than a seven-fold increase in the number of those with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and treated with insulin. 'Most of this is unrelated to clinical need... Insulin is very expensive and some of us believe that it involves too many serious side effects in people with type 2 diabetes. 'The increase in the number of people with type 2 diabetes using insulin is a wake-up call for all - not only in terms of lifestyle choices and how we treat people with type 2 diabetes.' But Simon O'Neill, Diabetes UK director for health intelligence, said: 'While this study reflects the growing scale of diabetes, it is also important to remember that insulin is an essential treatment that enables people with diabetes to stay alive and effectively manage their condition so that they can reduce their risk of devastating complications such as blindness, amputations and strokes.' 'Some people with type 2 diabetes are able to manage the condition with physical activity and healthy eating alone when they are first diagnosed but as the condition is progressive most people will eventually also need to use medications, which can include insulin, to help them effectively manage the condition. 'By making sure that people with diabetes are getting the recommended checks and support they need to manage their diabetes, we can help them avoid complications, which are not only a personal tragedy for all of those involved but are also hugely costly to the NHS.' Around 3.8 million people in the UK have diabetes. There are three million living with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and around 850,000 more who have type 2 diabetes but are undiagnosed.","Insulin use has trebled in the UK over the last 20 years driven by diabetes .

"By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . and Emma Innes . Hair straighteners and styling tongs are responsible for nearly one in 20 cases of children needing hospital treatment for burns, new research shows. This makes the gadgets one of the most common causes of burns in children. The researchers behind the new study say warn that irons and hair straighteners are often left on the floor and retain a heat of 80C for six to eight minutes. Hair straighteners are responsible for nearly one in 20 burns in small children - they can reach temperatures of 220C and take up to 40 minutes to cool down . Youngsters who grab or fall on them can suffer disfiguring injuries as their skin is up to 15 times thinner than adults. Children make up half of all burns and . scald cases seen in hospitals, with the potential for lifelong scarring, . deformity and even death, say the authors. Nearly one in five had to be admitted to a specialist burns unit. The new research, from the Archives of Diseases in Childhood, also revealed that babies are ten times more at risk of burns than older children. Many infants scald themselves with hot drinks or food left within their reach - with the youngest victim being aged just eight months. Researchers are warning parents and other family members to take care to move mugs of tea and coffee away from inquisitive tiny hands. They can reach temperatures of up to 220C - hot enough to fry an egg. They can take up to 40 minutes to cool down - this is much longer than most parents realise. People often leave them on the floor where children can easily access them. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents suggests people follow the three Ss... They found in children under five, 55 per cent of scalds were caused by a hot drink in a mug or cup. Almost half of these were caused when youngsters pulled the drink on to themselves, causing burns to their faces, arms and upper body. The study examined the burns and . scalds of children admitted to five hospital emergency departments, a . burns assessment unit and three burns units across the UK. Researchers . found that of 1,215 children almost three in five suffered from scalds, . 32 per cent had contact burns and the rest were burns from other . causes, including sunburn. Children under the age of one sustained 10 times as many burns and scalds as school-age children. The youngest child to pull a hot drink over themselves was eight months of age, while the youngest child to climb into a bath of hot water was 16 months. In pre-school children, the majority of burns were caused by youngsters touching hot items in the home. Two in five such burns were caused by youngsters touching irons or hair straighteners and almost one in three were caused by touching oven hobs. For those over the age of five, hot water was responsible for half of scalds, mostly from spills during food preparation, chiefly burning the front of the body including the face. Hot drinks - such as tea and coffee - are the most common cause of scalds in children under the age of five . Study leader Professor Alison Mary . Kemp, of the Institute of Primary Care and Public Health, Cardiff University, . said: ‘Prevention is likely to rely upon heightened awareness and . behaviour changes by carers. 'While . these appliances must be kept out of the reach of children, there is . the potential to explore modification to product design to ensure . toddler safety,’ she added. The . study concluded: ‘Public information messages, children’s centres, . health visitor or family nurse practitioners should address safety . education as a matter of routine.’","Hair straighteners and tongs are responsible for nearly one in 20 cases of young children needing hospital treatment for serious burns .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Three people were arrested Monday after being accused of . forcing a 13-year-old girl into both prostitution and stripping under the stage . name ‘Peaches’ at a Miami club. Vilbert Jean, 36, Marlene San Vincente, 22, and DeWayne . Ward, 18, forced the young runaway into a life of sex slavery after scooping . her up off a Miami Beach street last month, officials said. The trio forced her to have sex for money on at least one . occasion she was forced her to strip at Club Madonna on the South Beach Strip, . according to an affidavit cited by the Miami Herald. The accused: (L to R) DeWayne Ward, 18, Marlene San Vincente, 22, and Vilbert Jean, 36, were arrested last week . The girl, identified only as D.J. in the affidavit, was held . against her will by the gun-toting trio and plied with drugs and alcohol, . police said in the report. She ran away from home and was reported missing on . December 10. She and two 15-year-old friends shacked up at a seedy motel . in North Miami. They soon met a man referred to only as AP, he brought them to . a nearby home. The two other girls were dismissed for being too young, but . D.J. insisted she was 18, said the report. Mr Ward had sex with the teen at least six times and she was . forced to have sex with a man at a motel for only $80, the affidavit said. Her captors did not give her any of the money, and forced . her to strip when she railed against having sex for money, the report said. Club Madonna owner Leroy Griffith filed an injunction against Miami Beach on Tuesday and is demanding that his club is re-opened and his losses covered . Charged: Mr Ward, pictured in court, faces several charges related to human trafficking for his role in the scheme . Ms San Vicente, who already danced for cash at the all-nude . club, forced her to spend her nights on stage, according to the affidavit. The minor was given ‘exotic clothing’ by the woman, she even . had her hair and nails done - she sometimes made as much as $500 a night, . authorities said, adding that she often made well in excess of $1,000 a week. The trio reportedly took all of it. They also held her . hostage with an AK-47 assault rifle, a .40-caliber handgun and threatened her . with bodily harm, police alleged. The firearms and large amounts of marijuana and alcohol were . recovered from the home after the girl managed to escape last week and her . mother called police, according to CBS Miami. Authorities have not arrested any other club employees, but . say in the arrest report that the girl was never asked to provide proof of her . age. He didn't know: Club owner Leroy Griffith says there is no record of the girl working at the club, and that he didn't know she was dancing on his stage . The girl told police she worked the club on Dec. 27 and 28 and Jan. 2, 3 and 4 earning between $120 and $500 a night . ‘The minor victim was never asked, nor did she ever provide . the Madonna club management any identification to verify her age,’ cops said. A club attorney told the Herald there is no evidence . the girl ever worked at Madonna. ‘We have no record of her signing in,’ said Richard Wolfe. ‘We have no payroll record of her working. All the other girls signed . contracts, we have no contract from this girl.’ Club owner Leroy Griffith also said he had no idea the girl . was at the club. ‘What happened to us is one of the dancers called up and . said ‘I’m going to come back and dance. Can I bring a friend?’ he told the . Herald. ‘You know, there are 40 or 50 girls walking in and out of the club.’ Hostage: The young girl was held against her will, forced to have sex with Mr Ward multiple times, threatened with violence and drugged in this home, police say . Though he doesn’t recall the girl working in his club, . authorities say she was on stage from Dec 13 to Jan 4, he lamented the young . girl’s plight. ‘I feel bad about it,’ the club owner told Local 10. ‘We're . having meetings about it right now.’ The club is fully cooperating with police. ‘We’re working with them, we want to get to the bottom as . much as you do,’ Griffith told CBS Miami. Each of the three has been charged with human trafficking, . lewd and lascivious conduct on a person under 16, delivering a controlled . substance to a person under 18 and contributing to the delinquency of a minor .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A jury yesterday found the owner of a nursery was to blame for safety failings that caused a three-year-old girl to die playing on a slide on her first day there. York College faces an unlimited fine over the death of Lydia Bishop who was asphyxiated when her neck was caught in a looped rope attached to the slide as she played unsupervised. Nursery worker Sophee Redhead, 25, who was helping to supervise Lydia shortly before the tragedy, burst into tears as she was cleared of all charges. Her barrister had told the jury that bosses ‘have hung Sophee out to dry’ and criticised senior managers for failing to give evidence at Leeds Crown Court. Lydia Bishop (right) died on September 17, 2012, . after she was found on the slide at York College nursery. Nursery . worker Sophee Redhead (left) has been found not guilty of Lydia’s . manslaughter by gross negligence . The court heard parents were unaware . there was an ‘attitude of neglect’ at the nursery where a ‘tick-box . mentality’ among management meant safety rules were followed on paper . but not in practice. Miss . Redhead was charged with manslaughter by gross negligence, but was . cleared by a unanimous decision. She was also cleared of an alternative . charge of failing to take ‘reasonable care’ of the little girl. York . College – owner of the on-site nursery – will be sentenced next week . for failing to ensure the health and safety of children. Lydia . died five hours into her first day at the nursery in September 2012. Her mother Rebecca Dick sobbed as the college of further and higher . education where she had enrolled on a mechanics course was convicted. Lydia Bishop was found blue and not breathing after she got her neck caught in a rope on a slide in the outdoor play area at York College's nursery, pictured, Leeds Crown Court heard . Police officers at the York College Nursery playground. Lydia's mother Rebecca Dick recalled her daughter's last words to her in a statement read out in court. The toddler told her mother: 'I love you mummy, see you later' Lydia . had asked her to bring sweets ‘for being good’ when she picked her up . and her final words were: ‘I love you mummy, see you later.’ But Miss . Dick, 24, never saw her alive again. She . and Lydia’s father, self-employed joiner Brad Bishop, 26, had dropped . their daughter off at 9am. Around mid-afternoon Miss Dick was ushered . out of class and taken to York Hospital by police where she found . doctors trying in vain to revive Lydia. A . medical expert said the girl could have recovered had she been found . within a few minutes of being choked, but there was a 20-minute delay . before nursery staff found her. CCTV . showed children twice played unsupervised on the slide that day. There . had been two accidents involving the rope weeks earlier. Lydia . had walked around a ‘futile’ makeshift barrier of a bench and toy . trolley designed to stop children from going to the play area alone. Miss Redhead was accused of seeing her walk towards the slide and doing nothing, but the jury decided she was not to blame. York College - which operated the nursery for children of staff, students and members of the public - was found guilty of health and safety charges . The college will be sentenced by Judge Coulson next week. Miss Redhead was also found not guilty of a separate charge under health and safety legislation, for not taking 'reasonable care' of Lydia . The . CCTV shows Lydia, dressed in white trousers, climbing the steps to the . slide, before a slight movement is seen at the top of the slide. Almost . 20 minutes later a member of staff realised Lydia was missing and asked . Miss Redhead to check outside. She looked towards the slide and saw . Lydia lying on it. CCTV shows her running over and then carrying the . lifeless girl in her arms. Sobbing, . she told the court: ‘As I got closer I saw something on the slide, . something white. I realised that she was on the slide.’ Miss Redhead . untangled the rope from Lydia’s neck. ‘I pushed her and shouted her . name,’ she said. Despite desperate efforts at CPR, Lydia never regained . consciousness. Prosecutor . Robert Smith, QC, said there had been ‘systemic failure’ by staff and . management at York  College to impose basic safety procedures. Rules . forbade children playing on the slide unsupervised and the ropes were . supposed to be put away. A risk assessment had identified the danger of . strangulation. York College said the nursery had been closed and would not reopen. Chief . Inspector Nigel Costello, of North Yorkshire Police, said the case . should serve as a warning to organisations, adding: ‘Health and safety . is more than just a tick-box exercise.’","Lydia Bishop was found blue after hanging from the slide at nursery .

"By . Brendan Carlin, Mail on Sunday Political Reporter . The ex-wife of disgraced former Cabinet Minister Chris Huhne is to stand by her boyfriend, former Labour MP Denis MacShane, after he was jailed last week for fiddling his expenses. Vicky Pryce, who has been dating MacShane for 18 months, hopes their romance will survive his six-month prison sentence, The Mail on Sunday has been told. Their relationship started shortly before Ms Pryce was herself jailed in March for perverting the course of justice after taking speeding points from her ex-husband to stop him losing his licence. Support: Vicky Pryce (left), the ex-wife of disgraced former Cabinet Minister Chris Huhne, hopes her romance with boyfriend Denis MacShane (right) will survive his six-month prison sentence . Mr MacShane supported Ms Pryce, 61, during her two-month prison ordeal – and now she intends to do the same by him. The exposure of MacShane’s crime followed two reports in The Mail on Sunday in 2009, which revealed how he submitted false expense claims for ‘translation services’. Last week, he was imprisoned for six months for fraudulently claiming £13,000 in parliamentary expenses to pay for jaunts to Europe, including one to judge a literary competition in Paris. The 65-year-old said ‘cheers’ as his sentence was announced, before adding ‘quelle surprise’ as he was led from the dock. Revealed: In 2009, The Mail on Sunday exposed how MacShane had submitted fraudulent expense claims . Job: MacShane (right), pictured with Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, was Minister for Europe under Tony Blair . Romance: Ms Pryce (left), who has been dating MacShane (right) for 18 months, intends to support him during his six-month prison ordeal. Right, Macshane arrives at Westminster Magistrates' court during the case . MacShane, who was Minister for Europe under Tony Blair,  submitted the bogus expenses through a company he set up under a false identity and used nine different spellings of his name so officials would think  the paperwork had been filled  in by others. Jailing him, Mr Justice Sweeney said that his ‘considerable and repeated’ dishonesty had ‘reduced confidence in our priceless  democratic system’. When first challenged over the MoS expose, MacShane accused this newspaper of ‘running unpleasant articles about me’ and ‘invading my privacy’. But as his guilt became clear, he was forced to resign as Rotherham MP in November 2012. MacShane has had a chequered love life. Disgraced: Ms Pryce's former husband Chris Huhne arrives at court with Carina Trimingham in February . He lived with the late ITN newscaster Carol Barnes from 1975 to 1981, although the couple never married. In 1983, he married Polish-born Liliana Klaptoc, but they later divorced. In 1987, MacShane married Nathalie Pham, but the couple divorced in 2003. His relationship with feminist writer Joan Smith ended in 2010. MacShane joins a list of MPs who have been exposed by The Mail on Sunday as expenses cheats. They include Tory MP Michael Trend, who was forced to stand down in 2005, and former Labour Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, who lost her seat in the 2010 General Election. Ms Pryce declined to comment last night.","Vicky Pryce is to stand by her boyfriend, ex-Labour MP Denis MacShane .

"By . Binky Felstead . Summer is in full swing at the moment here in the UK and I’m loving every minute of it. I’ve just started filming for the next series of Made in Chelsea, and am definitely relishing the opportunity for sneaky sunbathing sessions between takes! When the sun’s out, I like to keep my make-up minimal if I’m not doing anything special – caking on layers of heavy foundation in the heat is a definite no-no. So this week, I thought I’d show you all a hair style that’s perfect for this sunny weather. This casual fishtail plait does the job of keeping your hair off your face while being a lot more exciting than a bog-standard ponytail. This week Made In Chelsea starlet Binky Felstead shows you how to get the summer's hottest hair trend: the fishtail plait . The plait was spotted on the gorgeous models at Tory Burch’s SS13 catwalk shows and is a huge celeb fave, with boho babes Sienna Miller, Vanessa Hudgens and Blake Lively regularly spotted sporting the ‘do. This super-versatile style is perfect for festivals or summer nights out with friends, but also looks great for glam events a la Cara D in Cannes! Although the style may look intricate, it’s surprisingly quick and mega-easy to create. Here’s how… . How To Do Binky's Summer Fish Tail Plait Hairstyle . Step 1 – Tame Your ManeFirst things first, brush through your hair to untangle any knots so you have a smooth finish to work from. The last thing you want when you’re styling your hair into a braid like this is to end up with even more knots and tangles when you take it out! One of my faves is the Michel Mercier Detangling Brush; the flexible bristles are great for detangling the hair without pulling or breaking. You can also apply some serum at this stage if your hair is particularly dry or frizz-prone – the Sexy Hair Silky Frizz Eliminator is a great shine-booster with a weightless feel so your hair doesn’t feel overloaded with product. It is perfect for both day and night and is loved by boho babes Vanessa Hudgens and Blake Lively . Step 2 – Prep The Plait . You can go as wild as you like with this, it all depends on how structured you want the end result to look . Pull all your hair over to the side you’d like the plait to lie, and keep it in place with an elastic band – this’ll make it easier to create your plait. Then, to start the plait, tease the ponytail you’ve created into two halves. With one hand, take a small section of hair from the outer section of one half of the ponytail and move it across to the other side – into your other hand. Then repeat this movement with the other half of the ponytail; take a small section from the outer section of the other side and move it across the hair into your other hand. Continue the process down the hair, making sure you keep the plait tight as you do. Don’t worry if it looks a tad messy or uneven – that’s what this look is all about. You’re looking to create a casual, boho-chic braid, not choirgirl-style pigtails!Step 3 – Secure ItWhen you reach the end, grab a small elastic band the same colour as your hair and tie the plait in place. Then carefully use a pair of scissors to release the elastic band at the top of the plait – try not to snip your hair at the same time! Boots Essential Cushion Paddle Brush . John Frieda Frizz-Ease Original Serum . TreSemme 24 Hour Body Sky High Plumping Powder . Silvikrin Natural Hold Hairspray . Step 4 – Finishing TouchesUse your fingers to loosen the plait in places where it looks too neat, and to add volume at the crown. You can go as wild as you like with this, it all depends on how structured you want the end result to look. If you’re after some serious volume, sprinkle a dash of TIGI Bed Head Candy Fixations Sugar Dust Root Powder into your palms and rub into the crown. To finish, spray the plait and the top of the head with hairspray to hold the style. I’ve used the TIGI Session Series Work It Hairspray; it provides a flexible, workable hold ideal for a plait like this – plus it smells amazing! Enjoy fun in the sun and see you next week girls!Binky xxx .","Binky shares her tips on summer's hottest hairstyle .

"By . Alan Roden . and Matt Chorley . David Cameron will today send a ‘love letter’ to Scotland as he makes a passionate plea for families across the UK to save the ‘most extraordinary country in the world’. In a major speech at the symbolic Olympic Park in London, the Prime Minister will argue that 63million people across the UK all have a ‘voice’ in this year’s historic referendum. He will urge families in England, Wales and Northern Ireland to urge friends and relatives in Scotland to vote against independence, to ensure that the message till ‘ring out’ that ‘we want you to stay’. Stay: David Cameron issues a nationwide plea to people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland to urge friends and family in Scotland to vote against the break up of the union . Mr Cameron will claim that victory for Alex Salmond would ‘rip the rug from under our own . reputation’. With some opinion polls suggesting that support for the break-up of Britain has increased marginally in recent weeks, Mr Cameron will also candidly admit: ‘The outcome is still up in the air.’ His speech, which comes on the same day as the opening ceremony of the Sochi Winter Olympics in Russia, is part of a concerted ‘lovebombing’ campaign being orchestrated from Downing Street. It echoes a Canadian tactic that helped persuade voters in Quebec to reject separation in 1995, where the ‘Yes’ movement narrowly lost a referendum after being ahead in the polls. A campaign was arranged in the rest of the country at the time to demonstrate support for a ‘United Canada’, which is widely credited with the dramatic turn-around. Mr Cameron will speak at the Olympic Park in east London, where athletes such as Jessica Ennis, Sir Chris Hoy and Mo Farrah famously contributed towards Team GB’s impressive tally of 65 medals in 2012. Scottish athletes were involved in 18 per cent of those medals, but only three were won without the assistance of competitors from elsewhere in the UK. The Prime Minister's speech at the Olympic Park aims to revive the Team GB spirit which saw Jessica Ennis take gold in the heptathlon . Andy Murray and Sir Chris Hoy celebrate winning gold at the 2012 Olympics in London . Similarly, there are 18 Scots representing Team GB in this month’s Winter Olympics, while figure skaters from Northern Ireland and England have trained in Scotland. But if the SNP wins September’s referendum, a separate Scottish team would compete for the first time at the next summer Olympics in Rio. In 2012, Alex Salmond was widely ridiculed when he coined the term ‘Scolympians’ and failed to recognise the widespread support for Team GB north of the Border. Last night, Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon overlooked the SNP’s past record and accused the Prime Minister of ‘politicising’ the Olympics. In his speech, Mr Cameron will say today: ‘For me, the best thing about the Olympics wasn’t the winning - it was the red, the white, the blue. ‘It was the summer that patriotism came out of the shadows and into the sun, everyone cheering as one for Team GB. And it’s Team GB I want to talk about today: Our United Kingdom.’ Money: Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael yesterday told MPs Scotland would not be able to use the pound as its currency if it votes to break from the UK, the Government's strongest warning on the subject yet . He will add: ‘This is a decision that is squarely and solely for those in Scotland to make. ‘But my argument today is that though only 4million people can vote in this referendum, all 63million of us are profoundly affected. There are 63million of us who could wake up [the day after the referendum] on September 19 in a different country, with a different future ahead of it. ‘That’s why this speech is addressed not to the people of Scotland, but to the people of England, Wales and Northern Ireland. We would be deeply diminished without Scotland.’ Scottish National Party Leader Alex Salmond and Deputy First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon: She accused Mr Cameron of a 'shameful' bid to use the Olympics as a 'political tool' Mr Cameron will say the UK has a global reputation and is a ‘powerful brand’ around the world. ‘If we lost Scotland, if the UK changed, we would rip the rug from under our own reputation,’ he will add. The Prime Minister will also warn against ‘complacency’ and encourage people across the UK to spend the next seven months doing ‘all we can to keep our United Kingdom as one’. ‘Seven months to save the most extraordinary country in history, and we must do whatever it takes,’ he will say. ‘So to everyone in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, everyone, like me, who cares about the United Kingdom, I want to say this: you don’t have a vote, but you do have a voice.’ Similar ‘love messages’ were sent to Scotland from the House of Commons yesterday, where Tory MP Rory Stewart said the argument against independence cannot solely be about economics. ‘If a relationship is going wrong, if a marriage is going wrong, the answer cannot simply be to say 'you can't afford to break up because you are going to lose the house',’ he said. The answer has to be only one thing which is 'I love you'. ‘And the nature of that love that we express for Scotland, we in this House are struggling to express. We are not very good as politicians in talking about emotions. We have become very bad at it. ‘But we need to learn to do it because otherwise a party which is trying to reduce, that is trying to shrink, that is trying to vanish, will win.’ Speaking in advance of Mr Cameron’s speech, Deputy SNP leader Miss Sturgeon said: ‘This is a cowardly speech from a Prime Minister who uses the Olympic Park in London to give high-handed lectures against Scotland’s independence, but hasn’t the guts to come to Scotland or anywhere else to make his case in a head-to-head debate. ‘A ‘Yes’ vote will put Scotland’s future in Scotland’s hands, and will mean we will never again have to endure Tory governments, Prime Ministers and policies we didn’t vote for.’ She added: ‘With this tawdry bid to use the Olympic Games – past and present – as a political tool, David Cameron has exposed the utter hypocrisy and double standards at the heart of the ‘No’ campaign.’","David Cameron calls on the whole country to urge Scotland to vote No .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The daughter of a Venezuelan beauty queen and her British husband who were murdered in an armed highway robbery has started school in Orlando, Florida after moving into the care of her grandfather. Monica Spear Mootz and Thomas Berry were killed in cold blood after being robbed when their car broke down on the Puerto-Cabello to Valencia highway on January 6. Now their 5-year-old daughter Maya, who was in the car with them at the time of the attack, has started school in America just days before the one-month anniversary of their death. New horizons: Monica Spear posted this photo of she and her daughter Maya just days before the fatal attack that left her and her ex-husband dead . Heartbreaking: Monica Spear Mootz, 29, and Thomas Berry, 39, had an amicable split a year earlier but took vacations together with their daughter- including the one they were on when they were killed . Maya was in their car with them and suffered a glancing wound to her leg during the robbery. She was treated in hospital but did not require any surgery. Starting over: One of Monica Spear's former co-stars posted a video of Maya singing in honor of her new start at a Florida school on Monday . Mr Berry's British-born parents moved to Venezuela 30 years ago, while Ms Spear's parents live in Florida. There was a question of which grandparents would be awarded custody of the child, because it is typically granted to the maternal grandparents but Venezuelaâ€™s tense relationship with America made the issue even more fraught. 'Maya is my priority now and I need the Venezuelan government to help me obtain her guardianship', Monica's father Rafael Spear stated at the time of the couple's joint funeral. 'We have an agreement with the Berrys that the best for Maya is to be outside Venezuela,' he said, even though the Berrys also speculated publicly that it may be wise for her to remain in the same area as she was familiar with. The confirmation that she was allowed out of the country and put under the care of her grandfather Rafael Spear comes via Twitter, as one of her mother's former co-stars posted a message congratulating the girl on her first day of school in Florida. Monica Spear lived in Venezuela for a few years as a child but their family moved to Florida, and she eventually graduated from the University of Central Florida. She was named Miss Venezuela in 2004 and then came in fourth place at the Miss Universe competition the next year. Tragic: Rafael Spear, 61, told MailOnline: 'Maya is my priority now and I need the Venezuelan government to help Rafael Spear, 61, told MailOnline: 'Maya is my priority now and I need the Venezuelan government to help me obtain her guardianship' Crowds: Huge numbers of people turned up to the cemetery to pay their respects after the joint funeral. The deaths sparked protests and convulsed the crime-ridden country . She had moved back to Venezuela in . recent years to star in one of the country's top soap operas, including . 'Forbidden Passions'. Ms Spear's family had asked her to move to the U.S. with them after she was robbed six times, but the model refused. Her . co-star from the telenovela was Jencarlos Canela, who wrote in Spanish . on Twitter: 'Today you had your first day of school in Orlando, Welcome . my Maya Bella.' That tweet, . which was posted Monday, has since been deleted but he also posted a . video of the 5-year-old singing on her birthday. That link remains live.

Better times: Some friends thought that they were going to announce that they were back together after the January vacation (seen at their wedding in 2008, the same year that their daughter was born) The couple had reportedly separated a year before their death but remained close and went on vacations together to spend time with their daughter. They were on one such trip touring the country during the week leading up to the attack and their friends thought that it may lead to a reunion. Police have attributed the fatal attack to the disruption of the country's moral fiber as a result of the dramatic telenovelas like the one that Ms Spears starred in. Seven people have been arrested in connection to the shooting.","Thomas Berry and Monica Spear Mootz were murdered in Venezuela on January 6 and their daughter Maya has now moved to the U.S.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The death toll has risen to 22 in a killer heroin epidemic that has plagued the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for the last nine days. Numerous more victims of the super-powered heroin are flooding emergency rooms with non-fatal overdoses and even drug dealers are beginning to warn customers about the potency of the new strain. Health officials believe the culprit is heroin laced with fentanyl, an opiate 100 time more powerful than morphine. The new hotshots are being sold on the street marketed as 'Theraflu,' 'Bud Ice' and 'Income Tax,' according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Public health officials, along with federal, state and local police are rattling the bushes, rounding up addicts and dealers alike to determine the source of the deadly drugs. Scroll down for video . Crisis: Officials say they've found these heroin bags stamped 'Theraflu' in possession of some of the over a dozen dead drug users who've died in the past week . 'It's not like this comes from an FDA . pharmacy,' Dr Neil Capretto, a medical direction of a local drug rehab . clinic, told the newspaper. 'You . don't know what's in it. We know that the advice not to use heroin in . the first place falls on deaf ears for people with addiction. 'If . you don't heed that advice and you are going to use, I would recommend . using significantly less because if you don't, this could be the last . time you shoot up.' Three . people were declared dead Sunday morning alone after apparent heroin . overdoses in Allegheny County and officials warn the situation now looks . startlingly like the crisis of 1988 when 18 Pittsburghers were killed . by a powerful synthetic heroin called China White. 'The fentanyl we're seeing as a powder has to be made by somebody,' Allegheny County medical examiner Dr. Karl Williams told ABC News. 'Somebody is making this somewhere in a clandestine laboratory.' Fentanyl is manufactured as a legal pain killer, but authorities suspect the fentanyl that laced the heroin was made in an illegal lab 'by some clever chemists.' Allegheny county sees about one overdose case per day, Williams said. What's happened in the past week is extremely out of the ordinary. 'We usually deal with 250 drug overdoses a year so what’s going on is really significant,' he told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Fentanyl resembles heroin, though it is much more potent, and it has been blamed for dozens of deaths around the U.S. Been here before? Found in some of the Theraflu bags was the super-potent narcotic Theraflu, which officials like Allegheny County medical examiner Dr. Karl Williams (right) says makes the recent rash of deaths eerily similar to the 1988 China White epidemic . China White: In 1988, 18 were killed in the Pittsburgh area by a drug called 3-methylfentanyl, a sort of synthetic heroin with the street name China White . Each of the people who died in the rash of overdoses has a known history of drug abuse, particularly heroin, Williams said. Deaths also have been reported in Westmoreland County, Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto’s office said. The area has seen periodic rises in the overdose rate, notably in 1988 when a potent chemical called 3-methylfentanyl, AKA China White, was introduced to heroin users in the area, killing 18 of them. It remains to be seen if each of the recent victims died due to heroin laced with fentanyl. 'I don’t know yet what we’ll find in the bodies of these people,' Williams said, though something is clearly out there causing the steep rise in heroin-related deaths. 'We’re obviously dealing with a major public health crisis,' he said, something 'bringing to mind the very localized China White epidemic we had in 1988.'","Investigators have found many of the drug users possessed heroin bags labelled 'Theraflu,' 'Bud Ice' and 'Income Tax'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Growing numbers of women are being spied on by hackers who access their webcams then take secret pictures and post them on 'sex slave' forums. The hackers - known as Rats - infect the device with a remote administration tool (RAT) that opens up the woman's screen, webcam, files and microphone. These women can then be monitored in secret or taunted by the hacker who sends mocking messages and pictures into her computer. Concerning: Hackers now able to spy on women by taking control of their computers and watching them through their webcams . The phenomenon is not new but has now reached giant proportions with tech site Arstechnica revealing that one of the 'slave forums' has 23 million total posts. One user wrote: 'Poor people think they are alone in their private homes, but have no idea they are the laughing stock on HackForums.' 'It would be funny if one of these slaves venture into learning how to hack and comes across this thread,' he continued. The scheme works by fooling the victim into downloading a small piece of software onto their machine. This can be done by sending them an email asking them to click to see a picture or listen to a song, for example. Once . installed, the RAT software allows the hacker to take control of the machine at any . time - rather like the system some big firms use to update their . machine's software and fix IT problems. Hackers can control the machine as if they . were sitting at it - doing everything from switching on the webcam to . looking through files on the hard drive to find bank details and personal pictures. Horrifying: The woman feeding a baby is visible from thousands of miles away on a hacker's computer . To avoid becoming infected, experts say you should: . The most at risk computers are those running older software which has not been updated, and those without up to date anti-virus software installed. One of the biggest problems ratters face . is the webcam lights which indicate when the camera is in use and alert . the previously unaware 'slaves.' 'Unfortunately she asked her boyfriend . why the light on her cam kept coming on,' one RAT controller wrote. 'And . he knew, she never came back :)' Entire . threads have been devoted to bypassing the lights - lists have been compiled . of webcams which do not have lights, as well as hackers sending fake . messages saying that camera software is being updated to explain the . flashing. There are even books which help hackers learn how to get into victims' computers. Hackers do not always target women - some of them are just interested in any voyeurism and revel in delving into users' lives both males and female. They even run alternate lists and compile photos of less attractive people they are spying on. Spying on their victims can have a . haunting effect - Arstechnica reported that one student who was targeted did not leave her dorm room for a week after her laptop . was bugged and she was taunted with private information. But some hackers fail to see they are invading people's privacy with their game. Control: Using a RAT to scare a victim is another favourite of the hackers - as well as taking content they can flash content up on the screen of the machine they have accessed . The victim is first fooled into downloading a small piece of software onto their machine. This can be done by sending them an email asking them to click to see a picture or listen to a song, for instance. Once installed, this allows the hacker to take control of the machine at any time - rather like the system some big firms use to update their machine's software and fix IT problems. Once installed the software allows hackers to control the machine as if they were sitting at it - doing everything from switching on the webcam to looking through files on the hard drive. One . hacker wrote online: 'For me I don't have the feeling of doing . something perverted, it's more or less a game, cat and mouse game, with . all the bonuses included. 'The weirdest thing is, when I see the person you've been spying on in . real life, I've had that a couple of times, it just makes me giggle, . especially if it's someone with an uber-weird-nasty habit.' Vicky Woollaston from Web User . magazine explains: 'A hacker can sometimes get access to someone’s . computer by infecting it with malware – this can include the victim . clicking on an infected link, opening an infected attachment on an . email, downloading a malicious file/game/software on to their computer. 'The malware/Trojan horse goes into the PC and opens it up so the hacker can access your PC remotely. 'Once . a hacker has access to your PC it can access all your files, change . settings on your PC and access what is being shown on your webcam for . example.' RATs are difficult to halt - too many exist, many of them are technically legal, and the source code for the software is plastered across the internet, but there are many precautions users can take such as using a solid anti-malware program, keeping the operating system updated, and not visiting dodgy sites or downloading suspicious content.","Hackers infect a machine with a remote .

"By . Mark Duell . and Hugo Gye . UPDATED: . 18:30 EST, 3 March 2012 . Rush Limbaugh has apologised for calling a college student a 'slut' after she argued that employers should pay for their workers' contraception. The controversial radio host's comments, which included a suggestion that Sandra Fluke should make a sex tape, caused a row which saw him abandoned by advertisers and even drew in Barack Obama. But today he acknowledged that he 'chose the wrong words' while trying to 'illustrate the absurd with absurdity', and insisted: 'I did not mean a personal attack on Ms Fluke.' Rant: Rush Limbaugh, 61, left called Sandra Fluke, right, a student at Catholic college Georgetown University, a 'slut' for saying religious institutions should cover birth control under health insurance . Mr Limbaugh had faced repeated calls . for an apology after claiming that the student must be sexually . promiscuous because she supported a contentious measure which would have . forced religious institutions to fund birth control for their . employees. But instead he dialed up the . rhetoric, first saying that Ms Fluke should film herself having sex and . then claiming that she 'had boyfriends lined up around the block'. However, after three companies pulled . their advertisements from his show and the President called Ms Fluke to . express his support Mr Limbaugh finally backed down on Saturday . afternoon, three days after his initial remarks. His apology read: 'For over 20 years, . I have illustrated the absurd with absurdity, three hours a day, five . days a week. In this instance, I chose the wrong words in my analogy of . the situation. I did not mean a personal attack on Ms Fluke.' He went on to argue that 'personal . sexual recreational activities' should not enter the public sphere, as . this undermines notions of 'personal responsibility and accountability'. Mr Limbaugh concluded: 'In my . monologue, I posited that it is not our business whatsoever to know what . is going on in anyone's bedroom nor do I think it is a topic that . should reach a Presidential level. 'My choice of words was not the best, . and in the attempt to be humorous, I created a national stir. I . sincerely apologise to Ms Fluke for the insulting word choices.' Angry: Mattress retailer Sleep Train, based in Rocklin, California, has bowed to pressure on Twitter and said it will no longer advertise on the show . Also angry: Another mattress company in Sleep Number also announced through a spokesman that they were 'immediately suspending' all advertising on the Rush Limbaugh show . Out: Quicken Loans also decided to pull advertising from the show after the 'inflammatory comments' On his radio show yesterday, the . 61-year-old defended his comments  and went on to suggest that Ms Fluke . 'had boyfriends lined up around the block. Or they would have been in my . day'. He said: 'She's . having so much sex that she's going broke, she says... You're worried . here that I'm just stepping in it deeper, yes you are but this is the . truth.' 'If we are going to pay for your contraceptives and thus pay for you to have sex... we want you to post the videos online so we can all watch' Rush Limbaugh . On Friday three . advertisers revealed they will pull all adverts from the radio show . after the host had made fun of Ms Fluke for saying religious . institutions should cover birth control in health insurance - and said . in a further show that she should have to make sex tapes if this ever . happens. Mattress retailers Sleep Train . and Sleep Number, as well as mortgage lender QuickenLoans, have all . bowed to pressure on Twitter and said they will no longer advertise on . the show. ‘We don't condone negative comments . directed toward any group,’ a Sleep Train spokesman tweeted. ‘Thanks to all of you . for your concern and input.’ 'Recent . comments by Rush Limbaugh do not align with our values,' a Sleep Number . spokesman said. 'So we made decision to immediately suspend all . advertising on that program.' A QuickenLoans spokesman . said: 'Due to continued inflammatory comments - along with valuable . feedback from clients & team members - QL has suspended ads on Rush . Limbaugh.' Meanwhile advertiser ProFlowers said it will . 're-evaluate’ its marketing plan and dating site eHarmony insisted it . will look into ‘the matter of 'network buys’. Mr Limbaugh said earlier this week that Ms Fluke, of Catholic college . Georgetown University in Washington D.C., was promiscuous for saying . woman should get the pill for medical reasons. And he went even further on his next show, saying: 'If we are going to pay for your contraceptives and thus pay for you to have sex... we want you to post the videos online so we can all watch.' Annoyed: President Barack Obama, seen on Friday, considers Mr Limbaugh's remarks 'reprehensible' and called Ms Fluke to express his disappointment that she was the subject of 'inappropriate personal attacks' Shock: Ms Fluke told MSNBC's Today show on Friday that she was 'stunned and outraged' by the comments . Mr Obama said he considered Mr Limbaugh's remarks 'reprehensible' and called Ms Fluke to express his disappointment that she was the subject of 'inappropriate personal attacks'. 'He said he hoped my parents were proud of me,' Ms Fluke said, adding that the President 'thanked me for speaking out and for expressing the concerns of so many women'. 'The fact that our political discourse has become debased in many ways . is bad enough,' a White House spokesman said. 'It is worse when . it's directed at a private citizen simply expressing her . views.' More surprisingly, Mr Limbaugh has . also faced criticism from the Republican presidential candidates, with . Rick Santorum calling his comments 'absurd'. When Mitt Romney was asked what he thought about the remarks, he replied: 'I'll just say this, which is, it's not the language I would have used.' Mr Limbaugh . said on his original show regarding Ms Fluke's comments on birth . control: ‘What does that make her? It makes her a slut, right? It makes . her a prostitute. She wants . to be paid to have sex. ‘She's having so much sex she can't afford the contraception. She wants you and me and the taxpayers to pay her to have sex.’ Ms Fluke said on Friday that she has been left 'very upset' by the comments made by Mr Limbaugh. 'My reaction was the reaction . a lot of women have had historically when they’ve been called these . types of names,' she told MSNBC. 'Initially to be stunned by it, and then to quickly feel outraged and very upset.' Spokesman: Ms Fluke was due to testify at a hearing on Capitol Hill last month about Barack Obama's mandate that health insurers provide contraception - but she wasn't allowed to do so . Another target: Mr Limbaugh also hit out at NASCAR driver Danica Patrick earlier this week on Monday for backing contraceptive insurance coverage . Ms Fluke was due to testify at a . hearing on Capitol Hill last month about Barack Obama's mandate that . health insurers provide contraception. But committee chairman Darrell Issa of . California said she could not testify at the hearing as it was focused . on threats to religious freedom. Ms Fluke later put her testimony on . YouTube and spoke about a friend who had to take birth control to treat a . disorder that caused ovarian cysts. The friend subsequently lost her . ovary. She also spoke of classmates who can’t afford contraception, . which was what really riled Mr Limbaugh. Ms Fluke claimed a female student spends $3,000 on protected sex during a three-year course at university, reported ABC News. ‘Three thousand dollars for birth . control in three years? That’s $1,000 a year of sex - and, she wants us . to pay for it,’ Mr Limbaugh said. 'She's having so much sex she can't . afford her own birth control pills and she agrees that Obama should . provide them, or the Pope.’ Female rights activists were left . seething and two Democrats walked out of the Capitol Hill hearing last . month after it was led by an all-male panel. Ms Fluke did eventually speak about . birth control at a Democratic hearing led by House Minority Leader Nancy . Pelosi last week, reported ABC News. She is a third-year law student at Georgetown and ex-president of the Students for Reproductive Justice group at the university. Mr Limbaugh also hit out at NASCAR driver Danica Patrick this week on Monday for backing contraceptive insurance coverage. But he has faced attacks of his own to . deal with this week - after a survey of American viewers found he was . their least-liked news personality.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . Lawyers for an Irish nanny accused of killing a Massachusetts baby said Thursday that medical experts hired by prosecutors have concluded the child suffered bone fractures weeks before her death when she was not in the nanny's care. Aisling Brady McCarthy's lawyers said in a written motion that prosecutors recently gave them reports from two medical experts — one at Children's Hospital in Boston and the other at the Miller School of Medicine at the University of Miami — who found that compression fractures to Rehma Sabir's spine were inflicted three to four weeks before her death in January 2013. The motion asks Judge S. Jane Haggerty to order prosecutors to give McCarthy's lawyers any other records and information related to the medical reports on the earlier injuries. Nanny: Brady McCarthy is accused of killing a 1-year-old girl who was in her care when she died in January of 2013 . During a pretrial hearing, also Thursday, McCarthy lawyer David Meier said the baby was 'literally on the other side of the globe,' traveling overseas with her mother during that time and not under McCarthy's care. Several weeks later, Rehma was taken to the hospital with severe head injuries on her first birthday. She died two days later. Prosecutors allege McCarthy was the baby's only caretaker when the fatal injuries were inflicted. Prosecutors did not immediately respond to the claims made by McCarthy's lawyers. The judge scheduled a hearing on the defense motion for Jan. 14, when she said she will also hear the defense request to release McCarthy on bail while she awaits her trial, scheduled to begin April 7. Mother: Brady's lawyers say the baby was traveling with her mother, Nada Siddiqui, when she sustained the injuries that killed her . MaryBeth Long, a spokeswoman for Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan, declined to comment specifically on the defense claims regarding the baby's earlier injuries, but said prosecutors will respond in writing and during the hearing next week. 'This is an important case and it will be tried in court,' Long said. Elliot Weinstein, a lawyer who represents the baby's parents, did not immediately return a call seeking comment. McCarthy's lawyers have previously complained that prosecutors presented information about the earlier bone fractures to the grand jury that indicted her, but offered no evidence linking McCarthy to those injuries. Attorney Melinda Thompson said during a hearing in September that prosecutors put evidence of the bone fractures before the grand jury 'to make it seem like my client was abusing this child.' Prosecutors have said that none of the witnesses who testified before the grand jury expressed an opinion on the cause of the bone fractures. McCarthy maintains that she had nothing to do with the baby's death and doesn't know what caused the child to not wake up . In the motion filed Thursday, the defense said the state's own experts have now concluded — a year after McCarthy was charged — that compression fractures to 10 of Rehma's thoracic vertebral bones were inflicted during a time when the baby was not with McCarthy. The girl's parents told police that McCarthy had been their nanny for about six months, caring for the baby in their apartment in Cambridge, just outside Boston. McCarthy lived in nearby Quincy. Prosecutors have said that Dr. Alice Newton, medical director of the Child Protection Team at Boston Children's Hospital, diagnosed the girl as a victim of abusive head trauma, which she said includes injuries caused by violent shaking and by striking the head or causing the head to strike another object or surface. After McCarthy's arrest, immigration officials said she was in the U.S. illegally after arriving from Ireland in 2002 under a program that authorized her to stay 90 days.","Lawyers say experts found injuries sustained weeks before the baby's death .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Tragic: The death of 72-year-old Jerry Waller, shocked the quiet Fort Worth community, where six shots rang out just before 1am . A Texas man was gunned down in his own driveway by police officers yesterday morning after he came out of his house to check out a neighbor's burglar alarm. The death of 72-year-old Jerry Waller, shocked the quiet Fort Worth community, where six shots rang out just before 1am. Mr Waller was reportedly awoke after a burglar alarm had gone off at a home across the street. He grabbed his .38 caliber handgun and went outside to investigate. Police responding to the alarm instead went to Mr Waller's home, where they encountered him in his driveway and near the garage. Fort Worth Police Cpl Tracey Knight told reporters that the officers - both rookies who have been with the department for less than a year - 'felt threatened' by the elderly grandfather - and shot him. A neighbor, Fort Worth City Councilwoman Becky Haskin told the Star-Telegram newspaper: 'It is really an awful, terrible thing.' She said that she was told by the police that an officer asked Waller to put down the weapon, but he would not comply. Despite that claim, Mr Waller's brother, Johnny Waller, said that his brother would have dropped his gun if officers asked him to. Mistake: Police responding to a burglar alarm at a neighbor's house instead wound up at Mr Waller's home, where they encountered the 72-year-old grandfather in his driveway . He told the paper: 'If the police said, ""Drop the weapon,"" he'd have done exactly that. Jerry was a law-abiding citizen.' The man's death has had the most impact on his wife, Kathy Waller - who blamed the officers for her husband's death, calling them 'trigger-happy.' Kathy Waller told WFAA-TV: 'Married 46 years, and then somebody gets a little trigger-happy and away they go.' She added: '[Jerry] would give you the shirt off his back and he was loving and he's a wonderful husband and I miss him dearly. Love: Jerry Waller had been married to his wife Kathy for 46 years . Cpl Knight told the Star-Telegram: 'This is a terrible . tragedy for everyone. A family has lost a loved one and a police officer . has gone through a critical incident that no officer wishes for. 'Our hearts go out to the family of the homeowner as well as the officer and his family.' Police would not say whether Waller fired his weapon, or if both officers had shot him. They have both been placed on administrative leave while the department investigates.","Jerry Waller, 72, was shot as he investigated the alarm of a neighbor across the street early on Tuesday morning .

"By . John Hall . An RAF Harrier jump jet that was once used by the RAF in the Falklands is being advertised for sale on a second-hand car website. The 1976 Hawker Harrier GR3 has also been used by the RAF in Germany and Belize but was last flown in 1990. The plane has spent the past 22 years in a heated building at RAF Cranwell in Lincolnshire where it was used for instructional purposes. Stunning: The 1976 Hawker Harrier GR3 has also been used by the RAF in Germany and Belize but was last flown in 1990 . Up for grabs: An aviation firm bought the Harrier jump jet (left) late last year and is now selling it on Pistonheads (right) - a website and forum for car enthusiasts . Learning: The plane has spent the past 22 years in a heated building at RAF Cranwell in Lincolnshire where it was used to teach trainee pilots, engineers and mechanics . An aviation firm bought the jet late last year and is now selling it on Pistonheads - a website and forum for car enthusiasts. The Harrier is said to be in such good condition that Chris Wilson, who is selling the plane, believes it could easily fly again. Mr Wilson, a former Red Arrows engineer, is the boss of Jet Art Aviation in North Yorkshire. 'In my opinion this is the cleanest first generation RAF Harrier you will get. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity,' he said. 'This aircraft has been preserved incredibly well having never been kept outside. The condition is so good in fact that there is serious potential for a future return to flight project,' he added. Near-perfect: The Harrier is said to be in such good condition that Chris Wilson, who is selling the plane, believes it could easily take to the skies again . Cost: Chris Wilson spent £60,000 on parts, £500 on paint and £10,000 removing the plane from RAF Cranwell . Mr Wilson said that ideally the plane will be preserved, adding 'it would be nice if was bought by someone and loaned to a museum so the public could enjoy it.' He bought the Harrier from the MOD in 1990 as a 'surplus aircraft in an unrestored state'. He then spent £60,000 on parts, £500 on paint, £10,000 removing it from RAF Cranwell and 600 man hours working on it. The result is an amazing aircraft . which comes with the correct Rolls-Royce Pegasus engine, although is not . currently fitted to the aircraft. It is described as 'externally complete' while the interior has the original ejection seat installed. The plane, which flew combat air . patrols in the Ascension Islands in 1982, was also used in the Falklands . during 1983 as part of air defence. Power: The Harrier GR3 is a 47 foot long jet with a 25 foot wingspan. With a Pegasus engine, it develops a staggering 21,800lb of thrust . The plane described as 'externally complete' while the interior has the original ejection seat installed . It is being sold with a mass of documentation and paperwork dating back to when it was first flown in 1976. Harriers are one of history’s most iconic aircrafts. They were first introduced in 1969 and were used by the RAF until 2010. The Harrier GR3 is a 47ft long jet with a 25ft wingspan. With a Pegasus engine, it develops a staggering 21,800lb of thrust. The fighter jet, famous for its ability to vertically take off, was capable of 731mph. Mr Wilson said he wouldn’t like to go into what he expected the plane to sell for, but it is thought to be a six-figure sum. 'It is the best RAF GR3 Harrier you will buy. The Harrier is the best of British and everyone knows what it is,' he said. 'We don’t know how much it is worth so we’re inviting offers. It is worth what someone is willing to pay for it,' he added. The plane, which flew combat air patrols in the Ascension Islands in 1982, was also used in the Falklands during 1983 as part of air defence . History: Mr Wilson said that ideally the plane will be preserved, adding that 'it would be nice if was bought by someone and loaned to a museum so the public could enjoy it' Famous for their ability to . take-off and land vertically, Hawker Siddeley Harrier fighter jets were . introduced on April Fool's Day 1969. Despite being 46 feet long with a wingspan of 25 feet, the plane only has room for a single pilot on-board. The Hawker Harrier GR3 model has a single Rolls-Royce Pegasus 103 turbofan engine capable of speeds of up to 730mph. The . plane has a combat radius of 230 miles - which means it can travel on . missions several hours from its base without having to return for fuel. It is able to travel for 2,129 miles between two fixed locations when not laden with guns or missiles. An RAF Hawker Harrier GR3 modified to carry sidewinder air-to-air missiles flies over the Falkland Islands during the two-month war of 1982 . The plane also has the ability to climb to 40,000 feet in just two minutes and 23 seconds. In . terms of weaponry, the GR3 is equipped with two 30mm 1.18 inch ADEN . cannon pods within the fuselage and can carry a variety of unguided iron . bombs. It also has . four weapon stations under its wings and one under the fuselage, with 4 . Matra rocket pods with 18× SNEB 68 mm rockets and two AIM-9 Sidewinders . air-to-air missiles. In the Falklands War in 1982, 10 Harrier GR.3s of No. 1 Squadron operated from the aircraft carrier HMS Hermes. As . the RAF Harrier GR.3 had not been designed for naval service, the 10 . aircraft had to be rapidly modified prior to the departure of the task . force. Harriers were decommissioned by the RAF in 2011, to be replaced by the Joint Strike Fighter by the end of the decade.

"By . Jill Reilly . Oscar Pistorius' girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, admitted to being scared of the South African track star in a text message sent less than three weeks before he shot her dead, a police expert told his murder trial today. Pistorius was in tears as the messages were read aloud in the Pretoria court - one of them from the model to the athlete read: 'I'm scared of you sometimes and how you snap at me,' while a later text read 'I can’t be attacked by outsider for dating u and be attacked by you the person I deserve protection from.' The couple argued about what she alleged was the athlete's short temper and jealousy, police Capt. Francois Moller testified, citing text messages he extracted from cell phones. Scroll down for video . Paralympic athlete Oscar Pistorius weeps as he sits in the dock. Reeva Steenkamp, admitted to being scared of the South African track star in a text message sent less than three weeks before he shot her dead, a police expert told his murder trial today . One of the model's messages sent using WhatsApp read: 'I'm scared of you sometimes and how you snap at me' Moller says that about 90 percent of the messages he downloaded were what he called normal and 'loving' exchanges. But there were exceptions that he printed out for the court in Pistorius' murder trial. The Olympic and Paralympic athlete is on trial for the murder of 29-year-old model and law graduate Steenkamp on Valentine's Day 2013. He has pleaded not guilty to murder, saying he was deeply in love with Steenkamp, whom he had been dating for a few months, and that he mistook for an intruder hiding in a toilet at his luxury Pretoria home. A message sent by Steenkamp read: 'We . are living in a double standard relationship. Every five seconds I hear . about how you dated another chick. You really have dated a lot of . people yet you get upset if I mention one funny story with a long term . boyfriend.' Oscar Pistorius takes his seat in court today.

Pistorius calls his girlfriend 'Angel' and she called him 'Baba.' In one message exchange the pair appear to be arguing over an incident at a friend's engagement party. Steenkamp wrote: 'I regard myself as a lady and I didn't feel like one tonight after the way u treated me when we left.  I am trying my best to make u happy and I feel as tho u sometimes never are no matter the effort I put in. I can’t be attacked by outsider for dating u and be attacked by you the person I deserve protection from.' Pistorius wrote in a message: 'I want to talk to you. I want to sort this out. I don’t want to have anything less than amazing for you and I’m sorry for the things I saw without thinking and for taking offense to some of your actions.’ He said that his illness and sickness was not ‘an excuse.’ ‘I was upset you that you just left me after we got food to go talk to a guy and I was standing right behind you watching you touch his arm and ignore me and when I spoke up you introduced me which you could’ve done but when I left you just kept on chatting to him when clearly I was upset.' In another message, Pistorius told Steenkamp that his friends will take the blame for a shooting incident that occurred a month before Steenkamp was killed.

Her . bedroom is situated across a grassy area about 70 metres (230 feet) from Pistorius' home, and the windows of the athlete's bathroom are . visible from her window. 'The . screaming at that stage just continued,' said Stipp, who recalled . looking out from a balcony at two houses with lights on in the gated . estate where her family and Pistorius lived.

Defence lawyer Barry Roux has said that after Pistorius fired into the door that he battered the door with a cricket bat to try to get to Steenkamp after realising she was inside the toilet cubicle . She . said she told her husband Johan, who previously testified, that the . screaming sounded as though a 'family murder' had taken place. 'There . was definitely a female screaming for quite a period,' Anette Stipp . said. 'You could definitely hear two different voices.' She said she then heard a second set of shots, and the screaming stopped.

Conversation: June Steenkamp, the mother of Reeva Steenkamp, talks to an unidentified woman from the ANC Women's League . It insists that some neighbors who testified mistook the sound of the cricket bat striking the door for gunshots. Pistorius' camp also maintains that Pistorius fired with quick bursts that gave . Steenkamp no time to scream, and so Pistorius did not realize he was . shooting at Steenkamp. A . South African police ballistics expert, however, has testified that the . first of three bullets that struck Steenkamp hit her in the right hip, . giving her time to scream before she was hit in the arm and head. Defence . lawyer Kenneth Oldwadge pressed neighbor Anette Stipp on her . recollections, questioning whether she was inside her house or on a . balcony while hearing what she said were shots and screams, and whether . she was alert because she had said she was slightly ill at the time. He said she was wrong to say the light was in Pistorius' bathroom around the time of the shooting. Stipp also testified about an incident this year in which she again heard screams in the estate at night. Together: Reeva Steenkamp pictured with Pistorius.

The sounds included a male voice screaming in both high and low pitches, Stipp said. The . screaming this year, she said, had 'very little emotion,' in contrast . to the screaming she heard on the night of Steenkamp's death. Nel, . the prosecutor, has said he will wrap up his case against Pistorius . this week after calling four or five more witnesses to support his . contention that the Olympian intentionally killed Steenkamp after an . argument.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Missing: Colonel Yuliy Mamchur was driven away by pro-Russian forces following an attack on Belbek Air Force base, near Sevastopol, on Saturday evening . A Ukrainian fighter pilot whose base in Crimea was stormed by pro-Russian forces is still missing - two days after he was taken for a 'meeting' with officers. Colonel Yuli Mamchur was driven away by the forces following the attack on Belbek Air Force base, near Sevastopol, on Saturday evening. He was reportedly later released - but has not yet contacted his wife nor colleagues, while his mobile remains switched off. His wife, Larisa, said yesterday she was . 'worried' about the welfare of her air force commander husband, who has . become the face of Ukraine' defiance after refusing to succumb to the . military might of Moscow. 'Of course I am worried; I can’t get in touch with him,' she told The Independent. 'They won’t say where he is.' Since the attack, the brake cables in the family's Renault Mégane have been cut, . while a number of death threats have been made, said Mrs Mamchur. And posters have been put up around the Crimean port calling for Col Mamchur's execution. When asked if her husband would be able to return safely, Mrs Mamchur said: 'I don't know. We'll see.' The fighter pilot was last seen as he was being driven away from the military base at Belbek, which is the last major Ukrainian military facility in Crimea to fall into the hands of pro-Russian forces. In recent weeks, he and his colleagues have become a symbol of defiance in the country. Scroll down for videos . Last sighting: The top fighter pilot (left) speaks with pro-Russian officers at the base on Saturday evening . In action: Col Mamchur, pictured with troops at the Crimea base on the day of the attack, was reportedly later released. However, he has not yet contacted his wife nor colleagues, while his mobile remains switched off . While other bases succumbed to threats . and intimidation, the regiment - featuring mostly pilots and other . aviation officers - dared to say 'no' to the opposition forces. Col Mamcher's defiance is partly to thank for the numerous senior Ukrainian politicans who have called for him to be freed - with some asking for international help in securing his release. Acting president, Oleksandr . Turchynov, yesterday called for Col Mamchur's release - adding that the pilot had been deliberately ‘abducted’ by the forces. Meanwhile, Ukrainian politician, Vitali Klitschko, posted a series of statements saying the colonel was likely being held in the detention facilities of the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol.

During the attack on Saturday, Russia sent armoured personnel carriers smashing through the base's walls and fired shots and stun grenades.

Plea: Oleksandr Turchynov, yesterday called for Col Mamchur's release - adding that the pilot had been deliberately 'abducted' by the forces . Meanwhile, . Russia's deputy defence minister Anatoly Antonov denied on Sunday it . was massing troops on the Ukrainian border, saying it was observing . international agreements. ‘The .

"By . Jenny Hope . New advice to pregnant women says painting the nursery and buying furniture may put their unborn babies at risk from exposure to chemicals . New advice to pregnant women says painting the nursery and buying furniture may put their unborn babies at risk from exposure to chemicals. It warns them to avoid paint fumes, or buying new fabrics, furniture and cars - even non-stick frying pans - while expecting or breastfeeding. Using fresh food rather than processed food will cut down exposure to chemicals in packaging, says a new report from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. And it’s not only the kitchen that is a potential minefield - the dressing table harbours products ranging from cosmetics to perfume that could pose a risk, it says. Women are advised to ‘minimise’ their use of moisturisers and shower gels and regard the tag of ‘natural’ or ‘herbal’ with suspicion. Other risks to be avoided are using garden pesticides and fly sprays - and taking painkillers ‘unless necessary’. The report provides a long list of what pregnant women should not be doing - yet has little evidence that any of it can harm the unborn child. The RCOG admits pregnant women are surrounded by a complex mixture of hundreds of chemicals in everyday products, most of them unavoidable and low level. Many are worried about the potential effects on their baby, says the report, so the right approach is ‘safety first’. It accepts little is known about the true dangers from environmental chemicals during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Studies in the lab, or involving animals, often don’t apply to humans, while research that shows a link between chemicals and hazards to the baby in the womb are not proof of causation. ‘On present evidence, it is impossible to assess the risk, if any, of such exposures’, says the report.A section headed ‘dealing with potential, but unproven, risks to child health’ says women are faced daily with ‘chemical scare’ stories. It says they may find it difficult to ‘effectively deal’ with the uncertainty - particularly when there is ‘scientific uncertainty’. But the report claims women should be given information about the uncertainties so they can make informed choices and take ‘positive action’. This takes the form of the ‘precautionary approach’ to chemical exposure that ‘assumes risk is present even when it may be minimal or eventually proves to be unfounded’. Scroll down for video . It warns them to avoid paint fumes, or buying new fabrics, furniture and cars - even non-stick frying pans - while expecting or breastfeeding . Dr Michelle Bellingham, Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine, University of Glasgow, and co-author of the paper, said ‘While there is no official advice on this topic available to pregnant women, there is much conflicting anecdotal evidence about environmental chemicals and their potentially adverse effects on developing babies. ‘The information in this report is aimed at addressing this problem and should be conveyed routinely in infertility and antenatal clinics so women are made aware of key facts that will allow them to make informed choices regarding lifestyle changes.’ However, other experts were sceptical the new advice would do anything but make pregnant women even more anxious. Prof David Spiegelhalter, Winton Professor for the Public Understanding of Risk at the University of Cambridge, said ‘These precautionary ‘better safe than sorry’ recommendations are not necessarily cost-free. ‘They may feed anxiety, and detract attention from the known harms of bad diet, smoking and excessive alcohol. And it is unclear how any benefits can ever be assessed.’ Justine Roberts, CEO and Co-founder of Mumsnet, said ‘Pregnant women are constantly bombarded by often contradictory information telling them what they can and can’t do. ‘This latest list of things pregnant women might want to avoid is bamboozling because of the sheer volume of things on it which in practical terms makes it almost impossible to follow. ‘What mums to be could do with is some clear, evidence-based guidance, on how much of what is safe to consume and what needs to be avoided altogether.’ It's not only the kitchen that is a potential minefield - women are advised to 'minimise' their use of moisturisers and shower gels and regard the tag of 'natural' or 'herbal' with suspicion. Other risks include painkillers . Tracey Brown, managing director of the campaign group Sense About Science, said ‘Pregnancy is a time when people spend a lot of time and money trying to work out which advice to follow, and which products to buy or avoid. The simple question parents want answered during pregnancy is: ‘Should we be worried?’ ‘What we need is help in navigating these debates about chemicals and pregnancy. Disappointingly, the RCOG report has ducked this. ‘As the report itself shows, there are many unfounded rumours about links between particular substances and pregnancy outcomes. ‘By contrast, we have plenty of evidence that stress is a major risk factor in pregnancy. Researchers and professional bodies should not be adding to it’ she added. The Royal College of Midwives was similarly concerned about the effect on women coping with the known stresses of pregnancy. RCM professional policy advisor Janet Fyle said ‘It is common sense advice, such as using fresh food rather than processed foods. ‘However, pregnant women must take this advice with caution and use their common sense and judgement and not be unnecessarily alarmed about using personal care products, such as moisturisers, cosmetics and shower gels. ‘There needs to be more scientific and evidence-based research into the issues and concerns raised by this paper.’","New advice warns to avoid paint fumes, new fabrics, furniture and cars .

"By . Arthur Martin . Firutia Vasile, 29, has been dubbed the 'benefits teacher' after claiming more than £28,000 and passing information on how she did it to her friends and family in Romania . Living as a Romanian immigrant in the UK, Big Issue seller Firuta Vasile sparked outrage when she won the legal right to claim more than £28,000 in benefits. Now the 29-year-old mother of four has become such an expert at claiming state handouts that she is helping her friends in Romania apply. Yesterday it emerged that Miss Vasile – dubbed ‘the benefits teacher’ by her friends – is encouraging some of her former neighbours to move to the UK. Her best friend Nadia Porojan, 29, spoke of her desire to follow in her footsteps. Mrs Porojan travelled to England in 2012 when she was pregnant so that she could give birth to her third child Shakira in an NHS hospital that August. Proudly clutching her daughter’s birth certificate, she said: ‘Firuta told me it would be better to give birth in the UK rather than Romania as it would be easier to claim benefits in the future. ‘When I first went to England I went to ask for benefits. Firuta told me than that in about a year or so everyone can apply for them. ‘And she was the one who could help me and was the one who put in a kind word in the right place. She is helping so many people as she is richer than many others. ‘She knew everything there. She is my benefits teacher. She knew where to go and how to ask for benefits for the children and for the house or for other needs. 'If I had 500 lei (£100) for a bus ticket I would go to the UK right after New Year’s Eve. But I don’t have the money yet, so I’m saving up. 'Sometimes Firuta sends me money and if she does it again soon I can start living my new life in England with the benefits money.’ Mrs Porojan lives with her husband Marian, 30, and their three children in a rural Roma community in the outskirts of Fetesti, a city in the south-east of the country. She receives £8 a month through child support benefit in Romania. Her husband earns a small amount of money by selling scrap metal. They also receive the regular payments from Miss Vasile, who sends part of her UK benefits payments to them. Nadia Porojan, Firuta's best friend, is hoping to join her in the UK after receiving lessons in how to claim . After giving birth to her daughter in Manchester in August 2012, Mrs Porojan wandered the streets begging for money, using her newborn baby in a bid to garner sympathy. Having left her husband, son Alexe, three, and daughter Denisa, six, behind in Fetesti, Mrs Porojan lived on state handouts with other Romanian migrants in Oldham. However she returned to Romania when her mother-in-law Angela became ill. This time she wants to take her entire family with her to live in Oldham. Mrs Porojan said: ‘I want to go back to the UK to get the benefits for my children. The British system is helping poor people. I have nothing here. On the advice of Firuta, Nadia travelled to the UK last August in order to make sure her daughter was born here as it would make it easier to get state handouts . Her daughter was born in August in Manchester, near Oldham where the family hopes to move . ‘Look how I am living. I have some potatoes on the shelf as food for my children and only a couple of days of wood for heating. This is no place to bring up children. Most of my neighbours would love to go to Britain because you can be rich there. ‘At least my little Shakira is a British citizen. This will really help us. I’m really looking forward to bringing them all up in Oldham.’ Miss Vasile’s case caused a furore in 2012 when a judge overruled Bristol Council and awarded her housing benefit worth at least £2,600 a year. She had already qualified for around £25,500 in benefits by then. At the time she said the benefits money would help her pay rent on her £130,000 three-bedroom home in Bristol, while she continued to earn around £100 a week selling copies of The Big Issue on the street. Firuta was claiming around £25,500 a year in benefits until 2012 when a judge ruled that she could claim an extra £2,600 in housing benefit . Any Romanian or Bulgarian citizen can now come and work in the UK under EU law . As fears continue to grow over the number of new migrants who are expected in the UK, a Romanian official spoke of his concern over the ‘invasion of people’ who will travel to Western Europe. Daniel Teau, the president of the Federation of Romanian associations in Europe, said: ‘According to our estimations, based on the number of Romanians who have left the country during 2007 to 2012, around 30,000 to 50,000 will leave the country every month to travel to Western Europe from January. 'The invasion of people who will take advantage of the benefits system in those counties is imminent. ‘I’m warning the Romanian authorities to take the necessary measures to prevent the imminent exodus of Roma people into Northern Europe. ‘We ask the Romanian government to send police officers to these countries to prevent the crimes of the Roma gangs who are already in these countries, or those who will travel there.’","Firuta Vasile, 29, is claiming £28,000 in UK benefits .

"By . Hugo Gye . Police were forced to free a dog from a manhole cover after it got mysteriously stuck in a sewer with just its head poking out. The animal was found by a group of teenagers who heard barking as they walked past a closed school playground in Lisbon. They went to help the distressed pet - but could only see the dog's head coming up through the ground. Stuck: A dog had to be freed from a manhole cover after getting stuck in a sewer in Lisbon . One of the five teenagers, 19-year-old Aura Preciado, said: 'It was coming from the manhole over a sewer but there wasn't any other way that we could see to get into the sewer. 'At first we couldn't see where the dog was but then we just saw this head on the pavement looking at us and realised that the rest of the dog was underground. 'It was impossible to pull it out through the tiny hole so we called the local animal rescue service who turned up - and who in turn alerted the fire service.' Rescue: An animal rescue worker using a hammer to get the dog out of its unfortunate plight . Success: The dog was eventually freed and returned to its worried owner . Animal rescue spokesman Ana Sousa, 39, said: 'We don't know how it got down there, but the rescue operation took an hour and involved four firemen because we had to carefully widen the hole where the dog was caught in order to free it. 'One thing is for sure, the dog could not have got there on its own. The entrance was too narrow.' Once the pet had been freed, rescuers used a tag on the dog's collar to locate its owner, who said he was delighted to have the animal back. He said he had been walking the dog when it suddenly vanished, and he had no idea where it had gone.","Pet was found by a group of teenagers in a school playground in Lisbon .

"By . David Mccormack . and Joshua Gardner . Courtroom riot: TV's Judge Joe Brown was tossed in jail Monday for inciting the crowd in a Memphis juvenile courtroom . Former TV Judge Joe Brown, who was jailed on a contempt of court charge issued by a Tennessee juvenile judge on Monday, is a free man once again. Brown, 66, was sentenced to five days in jail after he worked the courtroom into a froth as he questioned the authority of Magistrate Harold Horne while he was there representing a client in a child support case. 'He all but had that courtroom in a riot,' said Juvenile Court Chief Magistrate Dan Michael. But later on Monday a lawyer for Brown went before another court and found that judge was more lenient, the former TV judge was then released on his own recognizance, reports WMC-TV. Brown, a former Shelby County criminal judge, was in court to represent a client in a child-support case. He apparently became upset when he was told the case was not on the afternoon docket. He was booked into the Shelby County jail in Memphis Monday afternoon. According to the Shelby County Sheriff's Office, Judge Beasley signed an order releasing Brown on Monday evening. 'This is politically motivated,' said Brown on his release. '[The woman I represented has] been going through this for eight years. There was no date of birth, no names, no birth certificate. She doesn't know who the devil they're talking about.' Scroll down to hear audio from Brown's outburst... On his release from jail on Monday evening, Brown claimed that the charges against him had been 'politically motivated' Brown was Shelby County Criminal Court judge for 10 years before leaving the bench in 2000 to focus on his then two-year-old nationally syndicated television show. The show got canceled last year. Earlier this year he turned in a petition to run for the Democratic nomination in the race for Shelby County's district attorney. According to WREG, the fight was sparked after Brown was told there was no record of the case he was there to plead. In audio taken during the heated exchange, Brown becomes progressively angrier as the magistrate schedules a court date in April for his client. Campaigning: Brown's syndicated show was canceled last year after taping hundreds of episodes. He's now running for Shelby County District Attorney . 'He then began a diatribe against Mr Horne and the authority of the court,' Michael said. 'You want to get in to this, let's get into this, this sorry operation needs to stop!' Brown yells at the magistrate in audio taken from the scene. Horne had . Brown removed and gave him a day in jail, but Brown began to scream ever . louder as he was dragged away and it won him four more days. Brown repeatedly berates the magistrate and insists he lacks the authority to send him to jail. 'Ten dollars, that's all you got,' the audibly shaken former TV star tells the magistrate. 'I looked it up!' The . shocking outburst had some wondering if Brown's behavior has something . to do with an old grudge from his days as a Shelby County Criminal Court . judge or possibly his run for office. On the theory about bad blood from his days on the bench, Juvenile Court Judge Curtis Person denied that Brown had been deliberately targeted. 'We will not allow anyone to act contemptuous towards this court. Heâ€™s just like everybody else.,' he said. But asked about the possibility that it was all a stunt to win votes, Chief Magistrate Michael said only: . 'Within . five minutes there were three or four different attorneys down here . seeking to represent him. You can draw whatever conclusion you want to . draw.'

"By . Ben Spencer . The remarkable ability of pigeons to navigate with pinpoint accuracy has baffled scientists for centuries. But now researchers think they may have part of the answer - the birds follow hedges. Scientists from Oxford University found that homing pigeons' ability to remember routes depends on the complexity of the landscape below. Complex: As well as using hedges, pigeons are believed to be able to orient homeward from distant unfamiliar places using a mysterious system thought to involve smells and an inbuilt solar compass . While open fields are devoid of landmarks, and cities are too crowded, hedges provide ideal landmarks for navigation, they found. The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Biology Letters, released 31 pigeons from four sites around Oxford for an average of 20 flights each. Dr Richard Mann, who has since moved from Oxford to Uppsala University in Sweden, said: 'Looking at how quickly they memorise different routes, we see that that visual landmarks play a key role. 'Pigeons have a harder time remembering routes when the landscape is too bland like a field or too busy like a forest or dense urban area. 'The sweet spot is somewhere in between - relatively open areas with hedges, trees or buildings dotted about. 'Boundaries between rural and urban areas are also good.' Scientists are fascinated about how pigeons learn to find their way because the birds have such small brains. Urban: Despite being home to the majority of the UK's pigeons, cities such as London (pictured) are actually too bustling and full of landmarks for the birds to be able to navigate to the best of their ability . Whatever method they use makes highly efficient use of their limited mental processing power. Memorising the route, however, is only part of the process. Pigeons are also able to orient homeward from distant unfamiliar places, using a mysterious system thought to involve smells and an inbuilt solar compass. Cracking the mystery could allow the same processes to be installed in machines and robots. Tim Guilford, professor of animal behaviour at Oxford University, said: 'There may be certain rules that free-flying birds use to structure information that enable them to map the environment using their limited brain power. 'Fundamentally understanding how they do this will tell us more about their abilities and limitations, and could reveal methods that robots with limited processing power might use to navigate.' He added: 'We mainly use pigeons for studies like this because we can be confident that they will bring back the GPS devices with the data. With wild birds, there is a real risk that we won't get the equipment and data back, but fundamentally we expect them to use similar navigational methods.'","Scientists from Oxford University say pigeons use hedges to find their way .

"By . Emma Innes . More than 60 per cent of people put on weight when they are in a comfortable relationship, new research suggests. Some 62 per cent of people admit gaining up to a stone since being in a relationship, while 72 per cent also think their partner has put on weight. This is little surprise as 52 per cent of women say they often eat the same amount as their male partner, and 56 per cent admit this means they eat much larger portions than they would normally. More than 60 per cent of people put on weight when they are in a comfortable relationship and 72 per cent also think their partner has put on weight since the start of their relationship . The research, commissioned by Diet Chef, also revealed that 66 per cent of couples think they have put on weight together. This makes being in a relationship the most common cause of weight gain, beating comfort eating, lack of exercise, and holidays. The reasons for this are clear – 30 per cent of couples say that their main activity together is staying in and watching television, while 20 per cent state eating out together as a key bonding activity. However, these statistics are not the most disturbing. Some 40 per cent of Britons admit to burping in front of their partner, while 26 per cent say they are happy to pass wind in their long-suffering partner’s company. It seems that gaining weight is not the only way in which people let themselves go when they are settled in a relationship. Some 30 per cent of couples say that their main activity together is staying in and watching television, while 20 per cent state eating out together as a key bonding activity . The survey found that 26 per cent of people shave their legs and other body hair less once they feel comfortable with their partner. However, all is not lost as the survey also revealed that 26 per cent of people wish that they had a healthier lifestyle with their partner. Izzy Cameron, Nutrition and Weight Management Specialist at Diet Chef said: ‘This survey has revealed some very interesting results, and it’s surprising to see how complacent people can be when they are in a relationship. ‘It’s widely known that people tend to put on a little bit of weight once they have found love, but what we didn't expect to find was that the weight gain is on average a stone, if not more. ‘At Diet Chef we appreciate the role food plays in a relationship, and whilst enjoyment of food is great, it’s important to stay healthy and monitor what you eat on a daily basis, especially portion size.’","A survey has found that 52% of women eat as much as their male partner .

Spain's conservative government launched spending cuts in 2012 that aimed to save 150 billion euros (£124billion; $206 billion) to stabilise the public finances of the eurozone's fourth-biggest economy. The student protests came after an estimated 1million took to the streets of Madrid last Saturday. Protesters came from across Spain, where the official unemployment rate is 26 per cent and nearly half of young workers have no jobs.

"By . James Salmon . Disgraced former Co-op Bank boss Paul Flowers has spoken for the first time of his involvement in a drugs and sex scandal, admitting: ‘I have sinned’. The methodist minister said he had ‘frailties’ like ‘every human being’. He now goes to weekly therapy sessions after the ‘hellish’ period in November when footage of the openly gay banker allegedly buying hard drugs  became public. 'Deep-seated issues': Former Co-Op bank chief Paul Flowers has told the BBC's Newsnight how he checked into rehab for a month to deal with his drug addiction, and lost many friends in the process . 'Hellish': Paul Flowers admitted to the BBC's Jeremy Paxman that he had 'deep-seated' issues to deal with . It came after the 63-year-old quit his . £132,000-a-year job as chairman of the troubled bank in June last year . shortly after a £1.5billion black hole emerged in its finances. In an extraordinary interview aired on BBC Newsnight last night, he said ‘things got pretty hairy’ at the end of last year. ‘I am in company with every other human being for having my frailties and some of my fragility exposed,’ he added. ‘Most . people get through life without having that being made public but of . course I have sinned, if you want to put it in that old fashioned way.’ He . added: ‘I think I’m much more secure in my own skin, much more . self-aware than I was before. You certainly find out who your friends . are even if some in the bank and in politics and the church have been . noticeable by their absence.’ The scandal erupted as the Co-op Bank battled for survival after years of mis-management under Flowers and other senior bosses. A . rescue package was agreed in December that involved the self-proclaimed . ‘ethical’ group ceding control to institutional investors, including US . hedge funds. Chief: Methodist minister Mr Flowers pictured giving evidence to the Treasury Committee in November . Exposed: Mr Flowers was caught on camera apparently discussing cocaine, ketamine and crystal meth . But last . night Flowers heaped blame on the Government – singling out the . Chancellor – for exerting ‘considerable pressure’ to push through the . Co-op’s doomed bid to buy 631 branches from Lloyds. The bank was forced to pull out of the deal in April last year because of its parlous finances. Flowers . said ‘there was pressure certainly from [former Treasury minister] Mark . Hoban, but I believe and know that that originated much higher up with . the Chancellor himself.’ He . said he had received calls ‘two or three times a week’ from Mr Hoban to . check how the deal was going. However, his comments contradict those . made at the Treasury Select Committee on November 6, shortly before the . drugs scandal came to light. Asked if the discussions over the deal . amounted to political pressure, he said: ‘No, I do not believe they . did’. Last night the Treasury rejected  Flowers’ claims and said the . deal was a ‘purely commercial matter for Lloyds Bank and the Co-op . Bank’. The police . investigation involves allegations that Flowers used his Co-op and . Bradford Council email accounts to organise drug-fuelled orgies with . rent boys after a series of embarrassing messages and texts were . published. Downfall: The disgraced former bank chief, pictured on an exercise bike is also alleged to have brought drugs along to orgies . In one message, . he allegedly boasted to a drugs dealer of having two bottles of the date . rape drug GHB. He is also alleged to have used crystal meth, crack . cocaine and the horse tranquilliser ketamine – or brought them along to . orgies. The behaviour appears to have continued after the scandal broke, . with Flowers saying in a text in November: ‘Off f****** trollies on . coke and ketamine which I was given by this cute dealer in Manchester!! It is the best I have ever had.’ Media attention: Paul Flowers arrives at Stainbeck police station in Leeds in January to answer bail over alleged drugs supply offences. Police bailed him again pending further inquiries . Losses: The bank's 2013 results will be announced tomorrow and are expected to be the worst ever . Flowers has previously claimed his behaviour was influenced by the death of his mother Muriel  in 2012. But . it is not the first time he has been caught ‘sinning’. It emerged that . the real reason he resigned from Bradford Council in 2011 was because . ‘inappropriate but not illegal’ pornography was found on his laptop. He . was also once convicted for gross indecency in a public toilet in 1981. A . separate Treasury-led investigation is also investigating how Flowers . was appointed to run a bank, despite only working as a bank clerk for . several years after leaving university. He told the committee the . Co-op’s balance sheets had £3billion of assets, when it was actually . £47billion. The scandal has . also been acutely embarrassing for Labour, which has close ties with . the mutual. As part of a major overhaul, the Co-op is now considering . plans to scrap its £1million annual donation to the party. The . mutual is set to announce next month it made a record loss of more than . £2billion last year, driven by bank losses of between £1.2billion and . £1.3billion. It is now the subject of no less than seven investigations, including the police probe into Flowers, who is on bail. A . Treasury spokesman said last night: ‘Since the full extent of the . situation at Co-op Bank became clear the Chancellor has ordered an . independent investigation into the events at the Co-op Bank and the . circumstances surrounding them.’ Pressure: Mr Flowers claimed he was called two or three times a week by a junior Treasury minister and urged to allow the Co-Op to buy 600 branches of Lloyds. He claimed the orders came from George Osborne (pictured) Resigned: Chief executive Euan Sutherland quit the bank earlier this month after details of his planned £3.6million pay package - even as the bank contemplates selling off several assets - were leaked to the press .","Former chairman reveals he checked in to 'traumatic' addiction treatment .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . The National Crime Agency has been rocked by allegations that two of its officers have been using their positions to unlawfully obtain sensitive information, it has been revealed. Sheila Roberts and Brian Adair, who work for the agency dubbed 'Britain's FBI', have been arrested and charged with data protection offences. They are accused of using their jobs to access secret documents - including intelligence reports and personal files on suspects under investigation. Scandal: Sheila Roberts and Brian Adair (left), of the National Crime Agency, allegedly used their positions to obtain secret documents. Ex-police superintendent Glyn Evans (right) is also accused of data protection crimes . Initiative: The NCA, dubbed Britain's FBI, was set up last year to tackle serious and organised crime in the UK . The allegations were revealed today after The Independent successfully overturned a court order banning any report or mention of the charges. They have sparked the first major controversy for the NCA, which was set up in October last year in a bid to tackle serious and organised crime in the UK. Since its launch, the agency has been given a staggering £450million budget to track down cyber criminals, drug lords and paedophile gangs across the country. It has also acquired a reputation for secrecy - with only a . tiny proportion of the 350 people it has arrested in the past five months receiving any publicity. High-profile figures: The NCA was launched by Home Secretary Theresa May (left) in October last year. Keith Vaz (right), chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committe, said he was 'astounded' by the allegations . Roberts and Adair, who work alongside former Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) officials, were taking part in a drug-trafficking investigation, which was set up by Home Secretary Theresa May at the end of last year. But they have now been suspended from the agency and made subject to internal disciplinary proceedings after being charged with data protection offences along with Glyn Evans, a former superintendent from Norfolk Police. Evans, who is alleged to have unlawfully obtained secret counter-terrorism documents, is believed to be co-director of Corporate Security Consultants (CSC), a firm that offers security to UK embassies across central America. Another secret: It comes just weeks after the Daily Mail revealed the NCA had refused to comment on its arrest of top Number 10 aide, Patrick Rock . Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, told The Independent he was 'astounded' by the allegations - adding: 'This organisation was set up to provide a fresh approach to policing serious and organised crime. 'It is vital that all those who enforce the law act with the utmost integrity.' Roberts and Adair are being prosecuted by the Information Commissioner, who enforces the Data Protection Act. Adair has been charged with unlawfully obtaining intelligence reports from a SOCA operation, . Meanwhile, Roberts is facing charges of three counts of unlawfully obtaining and disclosing sensitive information, including intelligence reports and information about people. It comes just weeks after the Daily Mail revealed the NCA had refused to comment on its arrest of a top Number 10 aide. David Cameron's trusted aide, Patrick Rock, was spirited away in the middle of the night when officers knocked on the door of his West London home . But in an extraordinary move, senior NCA officials said they would not ‘confirm or deny’ the agency's involvement in . any ‘ongoing investigation’. Their ultra-secrecy stands in stark contrast to every other police force in Britain and recently released official guidance. A NCA spokesman told MailOnline: 'The NCA officers remain suspended and internal discipline proceedings are pending. 'The NCA expects the highest standards of professionalism from all of its officers, and has a zero-tolerance approach to corruption.' Meanwhile, a CSC spokesman said the firm was . 'unaware' Evans was involved in an ongoing investigation - and has since . terminated his employment.

"By . James Slack, Home Affairs Editor . Almost 4,200 foreign rapists, killers and other criminals who should have been kicked out of the UK are walking the streets after a surge in failed deportation cases. The number of overseas convicts who are being released from jail without being deported has soared by a fifth in the past year, despite a series of promises by ministers. More than 30 are walking out of jail and into the community every week. The number of overseas convicts who are being released from jail without being deported has soared by a fifth in the past year, despite a series of promises by ministers (file photo) Some 1,328 former inmates have been fighting deportation for at least six years. In many cases, they are able to thwart their removal by using the Human Rights Act, including article 8, the right to a family life. MPs said people were being put in peril by the failure to get rid of dangerous foreign convicts. The news will increase pressure on David Cameron to reform the Act, which was introduced by Labour, or scrap it. James Clappison, a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said ministers must ‘remove obstacles’ to deportation, adding: ‘There may be a need for radical action. The public want them to be returned, not have them hanging around for ever.’ Tory MP Dominic Raab, who has campaigned for tougher laws, said: ‘It’s bad enough foreign criminals using spurious human rights grounds to defeat deportation controls, but the growing number being released on to  the streets increases the risk to the public.’ Ruling: Home Secretary Theresa May issued instructions telling the courts that overseas convicts should normally be deported regardless of their family circumstances . Figures released to MPs show that between July and September 2013, 395 foreign former prisoners eligible for deportation were freed into the community. Attempts were being made to boot out almost 95 per cent, but most were thwarted by ‘legal issues’. In the same period in 2012, 340 convicts from overseas were freed. There were 265 failed removal attempts between July and September 2013, up from 165 a year earlier. Cases are halted when an appeal is lodged, commonly on human rights grounds. In recent months, officials have also released ten foreign criminals without even considering them for deportation. It was a failure to make checks on whether 1,000 overseas inmates should at least be considered for removal that led to the departure of Charles Clarke as Home Secretary in 2006. More than two years ago, Home Secretary Theresa May issued instructions telling the courts that overseas convicts should normally be deported regardless of their family circumstances. But immigration judges are defying her, claiming the guidance did not carry the same weight as the Human Rights Act. She is now changing the law to state that article 8 should no longer normally bar deportation. Some Tory MPs say her proposals still leave too much discretion in the hands of the courts, which could block deportation if a criminal can prove a ‘genuine and subsisting’ relationship with a partner or child. Mr Raab failed this year to have an amendment adopted that would have made the new law significantly tougher. It was defeated by 241 votes to 97 after Tory ministers abstained.","Almost 4,200 foreign rapists, killers and other criminals who should have been deported are walking the streets .

"By . Mia De Graaf . A gay banker who strangled his wife with a vacuum cleaner pipe and burnt her body in an incinerator has revealed how he 'snapped' when she threatened to expose him. Jasvir Ram Ginday, 30, is accused of murdering Varkha Rani on September 12 last year following a lavish wedding ceremony in India six months earlier. The newlyweds were cleaning their . family home when Ginday discovered Varkha packing her bags after he . fetched her a vacuum cleaner, the court heard. 'Secret': Jasvir Ram Ginday, 30, told Wolverhampton Crown Court he knew he was gay when he was 12 but married Varkha Rani, 24, to make his parents happy . The 24-year-old told him she knew he was gay and could not stay any longer - prompting Ginday to push the pipe against her throat with 'moderate force'. Giving evidence, Ginday insisted he 'definitely did love her' and did not mean to kill her. But he admitted he only proposed to hide his sexuality from his parents, who would be 'shocked' and 'devastated' by the truth. Opening the defence case, David Nathan QC said Ginday had snapped when his wife threatened to tell his friends and family that he was homosexual. Mr Nathan QC said: 'She had discovered that he was gay and she tells him the last thing that he wanted to hear - I’m leaving you, I discovered it and I’m going to expose you for what you really are. 'He snapped and he applied too much pressure. He had no intention of killing her.' Ginday told the jury he knew he was gay from the age of 12 but felt unable to tell his parents the truth because they would be 'shocked' and 'devastated'. Having never been in a heterosexual relationship before, he travelled to India in October 2012 and met 15 potential wives, before asking Varkha to marry him on March 28. Police found the charred remains of Varkha Rami the day after Ginday reported her missing . But just six months later, her charred remains were found by police at the couple’s home, the day after Ginday reported his wife missing. Varkha - who had a bachelor's degree and a master’s degree in science and information technology from a university in India - came to the UK with her new husband in August. Ginday admitted there were 'teething problems' to begin with and said their relationship never got intimate, but added: 'I definitely did love her.' During the opening of his murder trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court, jurors were told his sexuality had been a source of trauma throughout his life. He went to see his doctor due to . depression in 2010 or 2011 but was too uncomfortable to reveal his . sexuality to the GP, the court heard. And he carried out the brutal attack on his wife after she discovered his 'secret'. The court also heard that during a police interview Ginday continuously denied having anything to do with his wife’s death and said he was 'devastated' by what had happened. His barrister Mr Nathan QC said Ginday lied because he did not want to admit he had killed his wife. Ginday told Wolverhampton Crown Court he was 'devastated' by her death and pleaded guilty to manslaughter . Earlier in the trial the court heard Ginday strangled his wife with a metal hoover pipe before forcing her body into the 22-inch deep back garden incinerator and setting her body alight. He reported her missing and police attended the house but did not find her body until the next day when they became suspicious of black smoke billowing from the property. Ginday was arrested and taken to the police station although he did not confirm if the body was his wife’s. Pathologists later confirmed the human remains found by an officer were that of Varkha and that she had died from strangulation by a metal pole being placed across her throat. Ginday denies the charge of murder by has pleaded guilty to manslaughter and also a further charge of perverting the course of justice by lying to police. The trial continues.

"By . James Tozer . Malcolm Layfield said his position was 'untenable' and said last week he 'deeply regrets' his behaviour . A top classical music professor whose affairs with pupils sparked the sex scandal engulfing world-famous Chetham’s School of Music quit yesterday. Malcolm Layfield, who was head of strings at the Royal Northern College of Music, was accused by Frances Andrade of preying on students. He said he had resigned from the Manchester-based college as his position was ‘untenable’. Mrs Andrade committed suicide during the trial of Mr Layfield’s former colleague at Chetham’s, Michael Brewer, who indecently assaulted her as a schoolgirl. But the court heard that it was her fury at Mr Layfield’s appointment to one of classical music’s most eminent posts that first made her determined to expose Brewer’s crimes. Married Mr Layfield, 61, taught at Chetham’s – also in Manchester – alongside Brewer. He has admitted sexual relationships with at least six pupils, some of whom were just 16. It was stated all the girls were over the age of consent and the ‘liaisons’ were ‘consensual’. His appointment to the RNCM in 2002 provoked the resignation of concert pianist Martin Roscoe as head of keyboards. At the time the Daily Mail published claims by former pupils accusing Mr Layfield of plying them with alcohol and seducing them, then using his influence to deter them from complaining.

She committed suicide during the trial of Mr Layfield's former colleague Michael Brewer, right, who indecently assaulted her as a schoolgirl . Despite the outcry – award-winning pianist Kathryn Stott also quit, accusing him of abusing his power – Mr Layfield remained in his post.

Last week Mr Layfield resigned as a governor of the RNCM, saying: ‘I made it clear then as I do now that I deeply regret my behaviour.’ Since the Brewers’ conviction earlier this month detectives have received more than 20 complaints about historic sexual abuse by as many as six past or present Chetham’s teachers.

"By . Simon Carr . A railway thief has been jailed after he took advantage of new style carriage lay-outs to steal £13,500 worth of baggage from trains during journeys in the South West region. Sean McIlroy, 33, from Exeter, Devon, blamed his six week crime spree on a lack of benefits, saying his £40 release grant from prison left him £10 short on his rent. He travelled as far afield as Bath and Swindon but carried out most of his thefts on main line trains  between Tiverton, Newton Abbot, Totnes and Exeter. He operated on First Great Western, Virgin Cross Country and South West Trains. Sean McIlroy, 33, from Exeter, Devon, struck 19 times during his crime spree . The gambling addict struck 19 times in the space of six weeks and carried a pair of scissors which he used to cut open bags if they were locked. Among the items he stole were the entire belongings of a young traveller who was moving to the West Country and a complete set of Masonic regalia. Some of the people whose lost luggage was taken were so traumatised they no longer want to use trains at all, the court heard. More... Pictured: Rented flat stripped of copper piping by career burglar tenant who tried to sell it to a scrap dealer for £1,000 . The toughest and the roughest - they were our women at war . Judge Martin Meeke declared that users of new style carriages need special protection from thieves. McIlroy admitted 19 thefts and one offence of going equipped and was jailed for two years by at Exeter Crown Court. He told him: 'You began these offences very shortly after your release from jail. Your way of operating was to get on a train where the luggage was stored at the end of the compartment, take it, and get off at a convenient stop. McIlroy admitted 19 thefts and one offence of going equipped and was jailed for two years by Recorder Mr Martin Meeke, QC, at Exeter Crown Court . 'Like most of the population I know the layout of trains these days and as more seats are fitted in each carriage the overhead racks can only take small suitcases and passengers with larger ones have to leave them in the luggage racks. 'That means every traveller has to trust others on the train. The loss to passengers was in the order of £13,500 of which maybe £11,000 has not been recovered. 'That value does not begin to describe the anguish and upset, especially if someone is leaving home . On release from prison, those who have served a sentence of 14 days or more, and are over 18, may get a discharge grant of up to £46 to tide them over until their first benefits payment. If this proves insufficient they can apply for a crisis loan. Before release prisoners can apply for a community care grant, for furniture, equipment and clothes, and Jobseeker's Allowance  to ensure it activates as soon as they leave prison. Released prisoners may also qualify for income support, pension credits, housing benefit and council tax benefits. to go somewhere with everything they need in their luggage and you steal it.' His haul included laptops, cameras, video equipment jewellery and personal effects. His victims - 13 women and six men - included a retired policeman whose medication was in his baggage. Most did not realise their possessions had been taken until they reached their destination. Police recovered £2,500 worth of the stolen goods. Gordon Richings, prosecuting, said McIlroy was jailed by magistrates in Barnstaple in September for 24 weeks for similar offences of stealing luggage on trains in North Devon. He was released from Exeter Prison on . December 18 last year and the thefts started almost immediately on . trains across the West Country on the Tarka Line to North Devon, the . court was told . Defending James Taghdissian, said McIlroy came out of jail with just a discharge grant of just £40 and went back to crime because he could not afford the £50 he needed to rent a room. He said: 'It was all too inevitable he would fall back to offending in the way that he did. He has now re-established contact with his mother so in the future he will have more help and support.' In 2010 McIlroy was jailed for a year for stealing cash and gems from hisown grandmother.","Thief claims he returned to crime because benefits left him short on his rent .

Luckily for the junior chef in question, the royal was Sophie Wessex and the cone was made using easy-to-handle paper instead of sugar and cream. And it certainly seemed to go down well with the Countess, who beamed as she accepted the cone during a tour of the Gatten and Lake Primary School while on a visit to the Isle of Wight. Can I eat this? Sophie looks ready to tuck in but unfortunately for the Countess, this treat is made of paper . The Countess, whose last appearance was an emotional visit to the Surrey hospital where she gave birth to both of her children, looked on fine form as she was shown around the school and crouched down to get a closer look at the projects on display. Ever the style maven, the Countess was chic in a cream pencil skirt which she teamed with a tailored black jacket that showed off her svelte figure. After inspecting the school's project, Shanklin Our Town, the Countess was shown artwork created by pupils and was treated to a song about the town. Gatten and Lake schoolchildren were joined for the day by others from the nearby St George's School and St Catherine's School, all of whom have recently achieved their Duke of Edinburgh's Bronze Award. All smiles: The Countess crouched down as she chatted to a smiling little girl and a rather bashful young boy .

They fear Dr Abbas Khan’s body has been flushed with fluids to cover up evidence of anaesthetics in his bloodstream. Although the results of a British post-mortem examination are not yet ready, a CT scan of Dr Khan’s body has apparently shown a cut in the femoral artery in one of his thighs, suggesting fluids were injected into his body. The family of British doctor Abbas Khan, who was found dead in his prison cell in Syria, believe he was sedated with drugs before being hanged by his captors . His family also told The Mail on Sunday the Syrian authorities embalmed the 32-year-old’s body against their wishes before returning it to them. Dr Khan’s brother, Dr Shahnawaz Khan, 29, said he fears the embalming was a deliberate attempt by the regime to ruin any future post-mortem examinations as the process involves flushing a dead body with fluids to preserve it. He said: ‘We told the Syrians not to embalm the body, as we wanted to do it in Beirut ourselves, so we can take samples away for toxicology.  But they did it against our wish.’ Last week, a post-mortem examination was carried out along with toxicology tests at Queen’s Hospital, Romford, Essex. But his family fear the tests may prove inconclusive. Dr Khan's brother Shahnawaz, said their mother Fatima (pictured at a memorial service) was contacted by Syrian prison guards on the morning of the death . Dr Khan said his mother Fatima, 57, was contacted by Syrian prison guards on the morning of his brother’s death to tell her that her son was dead and there was ‘foam’ coming out of his mouth and nostrils. He believes the foam was caused by his brother being injected with anaesthetics before he was hanged. He said: ‘It’s sickening what they have done to him. Even if the results are inconclusive, we have good reason to believe that he was anaesthetised and then hanged.’ Dr Abbas Khan, an orthopaedic surgeon from Streatham, South London, was detained by the Syrians for 13 months and tortured in a series of notorious prisons. The regime agreed to free him a fortnight ago, but he was found hanging in his cell only four days before his release.

Dr Khan was buried on Thursday after a funeral at the Regent’s Park mosque,  North London, attended by  more than 1,000 mourners. On Friday, an inquest was opened into his death at the coroner’s court in Walthamstow. It was told that a Syrian post-mortem examination found that Dr Khan died of asphyxiation, and that he was due to appear before a terrorism court on the day of his ‘suicide’. But his family dismissed the Syrian claims as lies, saying it is ‘inconceivable’ he would kill himself days before his release. ● A Syrian government air strike killed 21 people at a vegetable market in Aleppo yesterday, activists said.","Dr Abbas Khan's family believe he was sedated with drugs .

"By . Tim Shipman . and Tamara Cohen . Britain has not lost its 'appetite to intervene' as a military power, the Defence Secretary said yesterday. In a speech in Washington, Philip Hammond said the West had been complacent to ignore threats from Vladimir Putin before the invasion of Crimea and called on Nato and European allies to 'raise their game' to boost defence spending. Mr Hammond told the Heritage Foundation think-tank: 'It is important that we reassure our allies in deed as well as word – and that is why the UK has offered Typhoon jets to augment Nato's Baltic Air Policing mission. U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel (left) listens while British Defence Secretary Philip Hammond at the Pentagon in Washington . 'I am used to representing a country whose resolve and willingness to use military force is not doubted.' Referring to Parliament voting against military action in Syria last August, he added: 'It does not mean we have lost our appetite to intervene. 'Over these last few weeks, we have been reminded, forcefully, of the uncertainty of the world we live in. The old threats have not gone away, as we perhaps too complacently assumed.' His comments came as David Cameron pledged to defend the Baltic states from Russian aggression. With fears growing that Putin might use force against Estonia, Latvia or Lithuania, the Prime Minister told MPs that Nato would act because they were all members of the alliance, whose founding principle is that an attack on one is an attack on all. Mr Cameron said: 'I think we should do everything we can to reassure our friends and colleagues in Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and in Poland, that we really believe in their Nato membership and the guarantees that we have given to them.' Warning: Russia's President Vladimir Putin speaks in the Kremlin in Moscow . Vitali Klitschko, the Ukrainian boxer turned opposition leader, accused Britain of not doing enough to deter Putin from going further. On a visit to Parliament yesterday, he said Britain had guaranteed Ukrainian territorial integrity under a 1994 agreement and called for tougher sanctions to be inflicted on Russia. Mr Klitschko said: 'We expect from the British Government more pressure, more action.  Crimea is not the goal. Putin is very open. The idea is to build a new Russian empire.' A Commons committee today warns ministers against further defence cuts. The MPs said the crisis in Crimea proved that the UK must retain a 'credible deterrent capability' against new threats. Their report says: 'A failure to do so could have significant implications for the country's security.' Under controversial Whitehall plans, by 2020 the Armed Forces will have axed 30,000 troops plus hundreds of warships, jets, spy planes and tanks. MPs said the National Security Council needed to re-evaluate the threat level to the UK following events in Ukraine when it updated the National Security Strategy next year. James Arbuthnot, the committee chairman, said: 'Deterrence must be credible to be effective: Britain has to show the capacity and the will to respond proportionately and effectively to threats at every level.' Visiting a First World War battlefield in Flanders yesterday, US President Barack Obama said: 'The situation in Ukraine reminds us that our freedom isn't free, and we've got to be willing to pay for the assets, the personnel, the training that's required.'","Philip Hammond said the West had been complacent on Crimea .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Friends have revealed that Huma Abedin was aware of her . husband's most recent indiscretions months before he decided to run for New . York City mayor. When 23-year-old Sydney Leathers released sexual messages on . Tuesday that showed Anthony Weiner continued his inappropriate online . relationships well beyond his 2011 resignation from congress, all eyes were . turned to Abedin to see if she knew. She stood by her man- though looking nervous and . uncomfortable while doing so- and declared that she was aware of his behavior . and they decided a mayoral run was right for the family. Her friends have now spoken out saying that she was . devastated when she originally learned about his relapse but she has had months . to come to terms with the news. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Show of support: Huma Abedin revealed on Tuesday that she was aware of his indiscretions 'before and after' his resignation and they decided to launch his mayoral campaign . 'When she found out, she was furious. She was furious, and . she thought long and hard about leaving, and ultimately decided what was best . for her and her son and her family was to continue to try to work through it,' unidentified friends told The Wall Street Journal. Telling her side: Abedin wrote an essay about her love of her husband and family in next month's Harper's Bazaar . They added that it was her decision to . attend and speak at the press conference on Tuesday, and she did not . make that choice under any pressure from her husband or his campaign. She has taken a number of tactical steps during the campaign, as she made a conscious choice to speak to People Magazine alongside Weiner and their son Jordan in June 2012. She also has been on the campaign trail with him, appearing in his official launch video and attending events at his side. An essay she wrote about their difficult journey over the past two years is scheduled to appear in next month's issue of Harper's Bazaar, timed so that the publication coincides with the Democratic primary on September 10. Abedin herself marked the biggest difference between Weiner's two . devastating press conferences- the first when he resigned in 2011 following the . accidental release of a photo of his clothed genitals on his Twitter account, . and then the press conference on Tuesday. In 2011, a then-pregnant Abedin was lauded for choosing not . to stand next to her disgraced, weepy husband though he said that they decided . to work on their marriage. But now, following her press conference debut, immediate . comparisons were drawn between she and Silda Spitzer, who served as the . inspiration for CBS's hit show The Good Wife following her decision to stand . next to the former Governor when he admitted to using prostitutes. Where they started: Huma and Anthony got married in July 2010, less than a year before he resigned . Big signal: She was lauded for not standing next to Weiner when he resigned in 2011, but now her decision to change tact on Tuesday has drawn criticisms . 'She's not the ""good wife"". If she had found out . yesterday she wouldn't have been standing there,' her friends told the Wall . Street Journal. 'She knew it was going to be a long and tough time, and she . knew he hadn't hit rock bottom.' In her statement on Tuesday, Abedin was clear to mention that they have gone through 'a whole lot of therapy' to get to the point where they are now, and other friends believe she sees his relapse as part of the healing process. 'She’s not fine and she’s not in good spirits. No one‘s fine when they go through this. But the emotional part of this was last fall,' and unidentified confidante told The New York Daily News. 'I assume (she stayed) because he was trying to beat this, and knew that’s part of the process.' Standing united: Anthony Weiner had his wife Huma Abedin at his side when he addressed the new revelations of another sexually inappropriate relationship that took place a year after he resigned . Aside from her appearance at Tuesday's press conference, Abedin has reverted to her low-profile ways, holing up in the couple's Manhattan apartment on Wednesday with a brief escape when she went into an awaiting car. No official . statements or plans have been released but insiders expect she will keep . a lower profile moving forward in the campaign. Her . decision to stay with Weiner after the first revelations in 2011 was . largely accepted by the public, under the assumption that he stopped . communicating other woman and focusing on their marriage. On the sidelines: Huma Abedin has been working for Hillary Clinton (pictured here in 2012 when she was serving as Secretary of State) since 1996 and is considered one of her top aides . 'I tell my friends . things that Anthony does and they're always like, 'Really? He does . that?! My husband doesn't do that.' I mean, I have not washed a single . piece of clothing ever. Anthony does all our laundry. I have not been to . our dry cleaner. He does that. He makes my tea when I get up in the . morning. He's just a loving, caring, thoughtful spouse and partner,' she . told People in late June 2012. Now . his messages with Sydney Leather prove that he struck up a new virtual . romance less than two weeks later, which led to graphic chats, phone sex . conversations and an exchange of naked pictures of his genitals. 'I . have no way of knowing whether Huma, for whom I have great respect, is . responding out of new motherhood, the Stockholm syndrome or a mystery,' women's rights activist Gloria Steinem told The New York Times. A . number of commentators have linked her behavior- or her 'Post Scandal . Playbook'- come straight from the pages of her mentor and longtime boss . Hillary Clinton. Abedin is the former Secretary of States' top aide and . has worked with her since 1996 when she was First Lady. Though . the Clintons have said from the beginning of the mayoral race that they . will not be endorsing any candidate- citing their close ties to many . from when Mrs Clinton was the Senator of New York- Abedin has used her . connections to help bring in big money donors for her husband. 'Her . loyalty is to Hillary Clinton and her role model is Hillary Clinton. Doormats. Doormats with the promise of a payoff later down the road,' conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh said. Photos: The Dirty also released two pictures that Sydney Leather (left) claimed Weiner sent her of his genitals . The criticism is not only coming from the right, though the Democrats are tending to focus on Weiner rather than Abedin. Minority leader Nancy Pelosi, who was one of the most vocal voices calling for Weiner's resignation in 2011, today told NBC's Luke Russert that his recent conduct is 'reprehensible, disrespectful of women'. Congressman Charles Rangel, who has been the Democratic representative for Harlem for over 40 years, echoed those sentiments on MSNBC Wednesday morning. 'Nobody that I know understands at all what Anthony Weiner was thinking about. And right now, I think you would agree that we all are concerned about his wife. She's a brave lady,' Congressman Rangel told MSNBC on Wednesday. 'I have seen a lot of things like this in politics where males have to lean on their wives for support, but I don't ever recall seeing a wife looking and feeling so sad and embarrassed, because Huma is a very private person, a very delicate, sophisticated person. And all the years that I've known her, putting her into this political situation, as bright and as intelligent as she is, is very awkward.'","Anthony Weiner's wife appeared at a Tuesday press conference confirming that she knew that he messaged women after his resignation .

"By . Jill Reilly . Nida Naseer, 19, was last seen at her home in Newport in South Wales . Scroll down for video . Police searching for a teenager who went missing three months ago have found a body. Nida Naseer, 19, disappeared in December after going to put the bins out at her home near Newport in South Wales. Today Gwent Police said they were called to Newport Wetlands at West Nash Road after the discovery of a body - the site is about four miles (6.5km) by road from Linton Street, where Nida was last seen. Her family has been informed although the body has yet to be identified and the death is being treated as unexplained. The teenager was last seen at her home in Pill, Newport, at 8pm on December 28. She was not wearing shoes and did not have her phone, money or coat with her. Since then her mobile phone has not been used and no evidence of her being alive or dead has been found. Relatives and police described her . vanishing as 'totally out of character' - especially as she needs . medication which stops her from becoming anaemic. Her . older sister, Shamyla, 23, told a press conference earlier this year . that she believed Nida’s disappearance was due to her being upset about . being unable to attend university.

"By . Lizzie Parry . An imposing stately home has sold for £16million for just the second time in its 650-year history. A wealthy farmer is set to call Shakenhurst Estate home after he forked out for the stunning Grade II listed mansion set in 1,324 acres of English countryside. On top of the 12-bedroom house, the estate comes with 15 farmhouses and cottages, almost three miles of trout fishing and a high-quality shoot. Sold: Shakenhurst Estate on the border between Worcestershire and Shropshire has sold for £16million . Grand: The imposing estate, which spans 1,324 acres of English countryside, has sold for only the second time in its 650-year history . New home: A wealthy farming family, the Staddons from North Devon, have snapped up the stunning property and are set to call the sprawling estate home . The home, which lies on the border between Worcestershire and Shropshire, was put on the market with Knight Frank in May last year with the estate agency today confirming a sale. While they would not reveal the final price, the estate is thought to have sold for around £16million - making it one of the most expensive sales outside of the M25. The hall is largely Georgian, having been rebuilt for a second time in the 1790s, and contains a library, drawing room, morning room, reception hall, dining room, kitchen and service passage boasting period features such as regency chimney pieces and moulded cornices and overdoors. The gardens, described as 'a legacy of historic Elizabethan, Georgian and Victorian designs', include a walled kitchen garden and a sunken rose garden, whilst there is also a butler's pantry room, boot room, scullery, cloakrooms, offices and cellars. It is only the second time in its history the house has been sold, with Knight Frank describing the property as 'a quintessential English sporting estate'. Instead of being bought by a wealthy foreign family as so many expensive UK homes currently are, Shakenhurst's new owners are the Staddons, a farming family from Devon. They said: 'Having to relocate, we knew the right place for us was somewhere which provided similar farming requirements within our scope. 'We were in search of a large number of acres of fertile arable land, the ability to rear quality livestock and accommodate a dairy unit, with the opportunity to expand and take on new challenges. Vast: The stunning Grade II listed mansion is set in 1,324 acres of English countryside at Cleobury Mortimer, near Kidderminster . Magnificent: The mansion boasts 12-bedrooms itself, while the estate comes with 15 farmhouses and cottages, almost three miles of trout fishing and a high-quality shoot . For sale: The home, which lies on the border between Worcestershire and Shropshire, was put on the market with Knight Frank in May last year with the estate agency today confirming a sale . 'Our list of objectives was hard to fulfil but the Shakenhurst Estate offered us what was needed. 'Having been a farming family for many generations, we hope that our new purchase will be the excellent foundations for many years to come.' The Staddons now own a Grade II listed 18th century home boasting a staggering 17,000 square feet of internal space. It has 12 bedrooms, eight reception rooms and nine bathrooms - with the large rooms having high ceilings and plenty of Georgian period features. Outside are formal gardens, parkland, a lake, stabling, traditional farm buildings and it comes with planning permission for a tennis court and swimming pool. They also have more than 1,300 acres of land, a pheasant shoot and wild brown trout fishing on the River Rea. In total, all the properties which are included in the estate boast 58 bedrooms. Shakenhurst Estate can be traced back to the Domesday Book when the is belonged to Ralph de Toeni. High price: While the estate agents would not reveal the final price, the estate is thought to have sold for around £16million - making it one of the most expensive sales outside of the M25 . Historic: Shakenhurst Estate can be traced back to the Domesday Book, when the stately home was owned by Ralph de Toeni . Family home: In 1349, Edward III granted Shakenhurst to his vassal, John de Meysey for services rendered overseas. It stayed with the same family until 2010 when it was sold for the first time in its history . New challenge: A spokesman for the Staddon family said: 'Having to relocate, we knew the right place for us was somewhere which provided similar farming requirements within our scope' Bursting with room: In total, all the properties which are included in the estate boast 58 bedrooms, as well as formal gardens, parkland, a lake, stabling, traditional farm buildings and planning permission to build a tennis court and swimming pool . The entire estate at Cleobury Mortimer, near Kidderminster, was later passed to one his descendents - John de Meysey - as a gift by King Edward III in 1349. It was to reward 'services rendered overseas' - probably in battle against the French. Incredibly, it stayed with the same family until 2010 when it was sold for the first time in its history. The owners then carried out an extensive restoration of the house and estate before selling it to The Staddon Family. Knight Frank today said the sale demonstrates a degree of confidence returning to the prime country market. Data from the agency shows prices in this area of the market increased by 5.5 per cent in 2013 while the number of potential buyers registering interest is up 16.1 per cent in 2013. Clive Hopkins, Head of Knight Frank's Farms and Estates team, said: 'Shakenhurst is a wonderful residential, agricultural and sporting estate in the true sense of the word. 'There is tremendous potential to continue the amazing improvements the vendors have embarked on. 'Opportunities such as this are rare as demonstrated by the fact this is only the 2nd time it has sold in 665 years.' It is thought Shakenhurst Estate was gifted to Ralph de Toeni by William the Conqueror . According to the Domesday Book, in 1086 the manor of Shakenhurst was in the ownership of Ralph de Toeni, the son of a Norman baron who fought in the Battle of Hastings in 1066, and died aged 74 in 1102. It is thought he was gifted Shakenhurst by William the Conqueror, but it is unclear whether he lived there as a tenant of the Crown or as the landowner. His father, Roger, who was born in Tosni, France, earned a fearsome reputation fighting the Saracens around Barcelona after he was sent into exile. He became known as 'The Spaniard', and spread terror after butchering captives and then boiling and feeding their bodies to the other prisoners. Roger later returned to Normandy but died in 1040, with his two eldest sons, from injuries sustained in a battle with a neighbouring land owner. It is unclear what happened to Shakenhurst until 1280, when records show the de Stuttenhursts, who later changed their name to de Shakenhurst, were living there, probably as Crown tenants. By 1339,  Walter de Shakenhurst, the Sheriff of Worcestershire and John de Meysey's uncle, was in situ. Walter died without having any children but passed the right to live at Shakenhurst on to Meysey. Edward III then handed over the entire estate to Meysey, whose family are thought to have come to England from Meysey in Brittany with William the Conqueror. William Lorimere, a trustee of the estate and a relative of Mr Severne, said: 'What we do not know is what those services rendered overseas were which prompted the King to gift Shakenhurst to Meysey. 'Shakenhurst was a royal estate, with inhabitants living on it like modern-day tenants. 'One can only speculate but 1349 was right in the thick of the Hundred Years' War - perhaps Meysey took part and was rewarded with ownership of the estate for fighting against the French.' Shakenhurst remained with the Meyseys until 1906, when the widow of Charles Wigley Wicksted, a Meysey descendent, left it to her godson, Hugh Gurney and his wife Sybil, satisfied that a handful of other Meysey descendents would be well provided for by three further country properties the family owned. Shakenhurst was used as a school for girls during the Second World War, by which time the widowed Mrs Gurney were struggling under a £20,000 gambling debt run up by their son, Peter, during his first year at Oxford University. She was forced to sell off substantial parts of the estate to settle the debt, and the house fell into disrepair with Mrs Gurney living in just two upstairs rooms. The property fell back into the hands of a Meysey descendent when Mrs Gurney left it to Michael Severne upon her death in 1961. It followed an impromptu visit he made to Shakenhurst 11 years earlier, where he told Mrs Gurney how the property was his ancestral home. Mr Severne and wife Rachel set about reviving the estate and launched a business manufacturing Perspex from a stable block in the grounds, which provided Shakenhurst with a much needed income. The firm moved to a new site in the Midlands following his death in 2007. In May 2008, his daughter Amanda died of cancer at the age of just 54, leaving a husband, a son and a daughter.","Shakenhurst Estate near Kidderminster has sold for the second time in its 650-year history .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . It comes as little surprise that Patricia Krentcil, New Jersey's notorious 'tanning mom' accused of taking her five-year-old daughter into a tanning booth, was a fan of the UV rays even back in her school days. And even in black and white, her high school yearbook photo shows Krentcil's skin a darker hue than usual for a blonde teen. However, with bouncing curls and a sweet smile, the photo also shows how much the 44-year-old's appearance has changed over the years – even if her tan has remained disturbingly dark. Color chart: Patricia Krentcil sported a tan back in high school according to an old classmate, which this yearbook photo seems to prove too - Krentcil is accused of taking her 5-year-old daughter into a tan booth . The picture serves as evidence of the toll Krentcil’s excessive tanning habit has had over the past three decades. A former friend from Cold Spring Harbor High School told the New York Post that Krentcil was ‘wacky’ and ‘crazy’ back in their 1982 school days. 'I do remember her being on the tan side. She definitely had some color’ the classmate said. Yesterday it emerged that Krentcil had . a history of bankruptcy but she refused to hide away and was spotted . running a number a number of errands while wearing eye-catching outfits . which complemented her lurid skin colour. Back at home: Krentcil changed into a skimpy outfit to do a spot of gardening, but got worked up at the press . Attack: The 'tanning mom' even aimed her hose at paparazzi as she stood outside her house . Most important of all Friday's . chores, of course, was topping up her signature tan at the salon where . she is believed to pay $99 a month for unlimited access to the booths. Krentcil . teamed that outing with a trip to Target, where she was photographed . picking out clothing with a pair of teenage girls - though she joked to . reporters that she was shopping for sunblock. She then returned to her home in Nutley - tired, you might expect, of being followed around by paparazzi all day. However, . she did not seem too bored of being noticed, as she very quickly . re-emerged - and she had swapped her tight trousers for a skimpy white . summer dress, all the better to show off and complement her . extraordinary tan. Rather than barricading herself inside, Krentcil watered the lawn in full view of the waiting press pack, until eventually she lost her temper in a showbiz-style blowout, and aimed her hose at photographers. Two unfortunate neighbours also ended up on the wrong side of her tongue, as she mistook them for journalists and tried to chase them away from the house before eventually realising they were in fact family friends. Earlier it was revealed that Krentcil, who is free on a $2,500 child endangerment bond, filed for bankruptcy in 1999 – the year before she was sentenced to five years' probation for credit card theft, forgery and theft for writing bad checks. In 2001, a bench warrant was issued for her failure to appear at a probation hearing. Krentcil was only arrested on the warrant last month when she was accused of taking her daughter into a tanning booth. Lashing out: She displayed fury towards unwanted visitors... but soon realised they were actually friends . Documents showing that there were 22 . judgments against her between 1997 and 2010, including $468 owed to a . New Jersey radiology group. Krentcil's financial difficulties . reached a head when she declared bankruptcy in 1999, the next year she . was arrested for theft and forgery. Court officials in Camden County on . Friday say her previous probation had been terminated and she would not . be required to appear in court. She had paid $4,000 to settle the . outstanding charge. Krentcil told New York’s Daily News . that some days she tans more than others likening her extreme tanning . habit to drinking coffee: 'Do you drink coffee? Some days you don’t. Same thing.' And yesterday she also fired back against . reality TV star, Snooki, saying the Jersey Shore star was ‘fake’, ‘fat’ and ‘disgusting.’ Krentcil slammed the fellow fake tanner to TMZ reporters after Snooki previously criticised her as 'crazy.' In court: Patricia Krentcil appeared at her arraignment on Wednesday because she was charged with child endangerment for allegedly taking her 5-year-old daughter tanning . Disturbing: Krentcil is showing no signs of slowing down with her tanning habits despite facing child endangerment charges for taking her daughter into a booth . The saga began when the teacher of . Krentcil's fair-skinned, red-haired daughter Anna noticed serious burns . on the 5-year-old's body. However, Krentcil has always denied that she took Anna into a booth. 'I would never, ever put my daughter in a tanning booth,' she told a TMZ reporter. 'Any mother who makes an accusation about me is not a mother because I’m a great mother - I would never do that to my child.' Pictures emerged on Thursday of Anna, . along with her brother Addison, in the arms of their father Rich . Krentcil at their Nutley, New Jersey home. Mr . Krentcil, a 47-year-old trader, stood up for his wife in spite of the . fact that neighbors have said she went tanning while pregnant with Anna. 'They’re making her out to be a monster,' he told The Daily News. 'She just likes it. She’s not a crazy maniac where she has to tan every day.' Pale family: Anna, 5, is seen being held by her father Rich Krentcil, and shown with her brother Addison , as the children are still living at home with their mother in spite of the charges . Krentcil . said that while she did take her daughter Anna to the tanning salon, . the little girl never got in the booth and was only there waiting for . her mother to finish her session. She argues that Anna got her sunburn . from playing in the yard and not breaking the law. Doctors say tanning . booths, which emit UV radiation, are known carcinogens. Krentcil's daughter apparently received enough of the radiation to burn her skin and leave her with painful damage, police say. Her attorney, John Caruso, disagrees, . as he said that Krentcil will be exonerated, because the evidence will . show the child never entered the booth. 'Forget . about the presumption of innocence; my client is 150 per cent innocent,' Caruso said. 'She loves that child more than her whole life. She would . never, ever allow her child to go inside a tanning bed.' Mother and daughter: The difference in hue of Krentcil (left) and Anna (right) is blatantly obvious . Shocked: Krentcil (left) and her daughter Anna (right) have been 'shaken up' by the attention from the arrest . The child is still living at home . with her mother, Caruso told Municipal Court Judge Roslyn Holmes-Grant, . though he said the state's child welfare agency is monitoring the . family. Mugshot: Krentcil clearly went tanning after her arrest (seen here) as she is darker in recent images . Krentcil said she loves tanning and . has visited salons for many years but would not do anything to . jeopardize her daughter's health. 'Never in my life would I endanger my . child by putting her in a tanning booth. I'm not dumb,' she said before . her scheduled hearing. Outside court, she called herself 'a wonderful . mother.' The Bergen County Record . reports that employees the tanning salon in Nutley, New Jersey, didn't . realize Krentcil had brought her daughter into the stand-up tanning . booth. State law prohibits children under 14 from using tanning booths. Anyone under 18 must have parental permission. The . incident was reported when a teacher at Anna's school overheard Anna . telling a friend that she went to the tanning salon with her mom, and . then the teacher pieced that together with Anna's noticeable sunburn. 'I tan, she doesn't tan,' Krentcil said, stating the obvious. With . her skin reminiscent of the outlandish character Magda from the 1998 . comedy There's Something About Mary, it is very clear that Krentcil has . been to more than one tanning session in her time. Fighting for her case: Krentcil (left) says that it was all a misunderstanding and that she did not take her daughter in the booth but only in the room while she herself was tanning . Trip to the salon: Krentcil argues the girl was in the room but not in the actual booth . Even . given the timing of her mugshot - taken on April 24 - and her Today Show . interview - which aired on May 2 - the difference in her skin tone makes . it clear that her legal scuffle didn't stop her from making a stop at . the tanning salon in the meantime. Krentcil says her daughter did not break any . laws by going in the room with her but not in the actual tanning booth. 'It's called a tanning booth and a tanning room,' she said. The legal situation has taken a toll on both Krentcil and Anna. 'It's traumatizing for a little girl who did nothing wrong but got a little sunburn,' Krentcil told Today. Police arrested Krentcil on April 24. She took the child to the tanning salon the week before, authorities say. The charge was upgraded to a felony on Monday, and Krentcil was released after posting $25,000 bail. A family told WABC-TV that Krentcil was 'shaken' by her arrest. Dr . Stephanie Badalamenti, a dermatologist, told the station tanning booths . can increase the risk of developing melanoma, a deadly form of skin . cancer, by 75 percent. 'This can be very dangerous,' she said. 'This can be a life-changer.' Watch the video .","Patricia Krentcil is accused of taking her then 5-year-old daughter into a sun booth .

"By . Richard Spillett . Prince Charles spoke of his love of home-grown veg after sharing a joke about a brightly-coloured squash at a food festival today. The Prince and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, visited the Edible Garden Show at Alexandra Palace to speak about healthy diets with local schoolchildren. As they toured stalls at the event in north London, the royal couple were seen laughing with TV chef Raymond Blanc after being presented with the yellow vegetable.

The Duchess was presented with a bright-yellow squash after the Prince spoke of his love of home-grown produce . The Prince, who promotes organic vegetable growing at his Highgrove residence, is a patron of the Garden Organic charity . The show is aimed at encouraging people to grow their own produce and promotes organic fruit and veg. Charles, 65, spoke to local school children after arriving at the event, telling them Brussels sprouts taste better as you grow older. After meeting the Prince, 10-year-old Noah Gordon told the Tottenham and Wood Green Journal: 'I can’t believe I was so close to him. 'He’s a very nice man. He likes talking to people. He’s really friendly.' Schoolmate Laura Solomon, 11, added: 'It’s hard not to boast when you’ve seen someone so amazing.' Well-wishers later presented the couple with a miniature wheelbarrow for their grandson, Prince George, the paper reported. Restauranteur Raymond Blanc later told his Twitter followers of his joy at meeting the Prince and Duchess .

Raymond Blanc, 64, was at the event promoting his work with organic growing charity, Garden Organic. He also told visitors to the show about the garden at his Belmond Le Manoir aux Quat’Saisons, his two Michelin star Restaurant and Hotel in Great Milton, Oxfordshire. In April last year, the restaurateur launched the National Heritage Garden Competition for gardeners to enter their designs. He spoke to Charles and Camilla, 66, at Garden Organic's stall before posting a picture of himself with the Prince on his Twitter feed. Charles runs the 'Mygrove' competition, which gives children the chance to win a visit to his sustainably-run garden at Highgrove. The Edible Garden Show is staged over three days from March 28-30, with guests including botanist and TV presenter James Wong and the BBC’s One Show and gardening guru Christine Walkden. BBC Radio 4’s Gardeners’ Question Time programme was also recorded at Alexandra Palace today to coincide with the Royal visit. Charles' trip to the food festival comes days after he was presented with a freshly-baked pretzel while touring the streets of Ham in Surrey. After delicatessen worker Petra Braun told him he would enjoy the snack because of his German roots, he replied: 'Well, that was a long time ago.'","Royal couple join TV chef Raymond Blanc at 'grow-your-own' festival .

"By . Laura Clark, Education Correspondent . Four-year-olds will be tested as soon as they start primary school under sweeping government reforms of exams and league tables unveiled yesterday. From 2015, up to 600,000 will be given a ‘baseline’ assessment in counting and letter and picture recognition within weeks of starting in reception class. Tests for seven-year-olds will continue to be marked by teachers but the writing assessment will include a separate exam in grammar, punctuation and spelling for the first time. Starting young: Campaigners have warned children could become overly 'schoolified' (file photo) Meanwhile, 11-year-olds will face tougher tests in maths, reading, writing and grammar to check they are mastering a new, more rigorous curriculum. The new tests for four-year-olds are being introduced to measure how well primary schools help their pupils progress until they leave at age 11. Parents will be informed of the results but they will not be collated into league tables. The shake-up will ‘expose coasting . schools’, which will ‘no longer be able to hide behind apparently . respectable results’, the Department for Education said. Exposure: Ministers say the plans will reveal coasting schools (file photo) But the changes will concern campaigners who fear play-based early education is becoming ‘schoolified’. The new assessments for four-year-olds will be carried out by teachers ‘in the first few weeks of reception’, the DfE said. It will be a ‘simple check of a child’s level of understanding - for instance, counting and picture or letter recognition’. Parents will be informed of the results but they will not be collated into league tables. Schools . will be able to use the tests from September 2015 and they will become . standard across the system from September the following year. While the tests for four-year-olds will be voluntary, all but the most high-achieving schools are expected to use them. Concerns have already been raised that schools could use the results to group young children by ability. A . separate proposal to rank pupils according to their results at age 11 - . for example, telling parents their children are in the top or bottom 10 . per cent - has been shelved amid opposition. Sue . Robb, of the children’s charity 4Children, said the baseline assessment . ‘must be part of a rounded assessment package’ and not ‘simply a “test” if it is to be effective’. ‘Young . children are unlikely to accurately demonstrate their true capabilities . within the first few weeks of entering school when many may still be . settling into the new environment,’ she added. The move is part of a wide-ranging overhaul of exams and league tables spanning education from four to 18. Measures include requiring primary schools to meet tough new progress and achievement targets or face being put in the hands of new leadership. These include ensuring 85 per cent of 11-year-olds meet a performance standard - against 65 per cent under the current system. Exam stress: There are already several tests which pupils have to do as they rise through the school system . Secondary school league tables will be reformed to stop schools concentrating on pushing pupils up to a ‘blunt’ C-grade threshold at GCSE. They will take a wider view of pupils’ achievement instead of ranking schools according to the numbers achieving five C grades or better. Schools Minister David Laws said: ‘The new system will mean higher standards, no hiding place for under-performing schools and coasting schools, and real credit being given to schools and colleges which may have challenging intakes but which improve their pupils’ performance. ‘In primary schools, we are raising the bar to improve standards and introducing a proper measure of progress from when children start school to age 11. ‘I want to see all children leaving primary school with a good standard of reading, writing and maths so that they can thrive at secondary school. A better start at secondary school is a better start in life.’","Up to 600,000 will be given 'baseline' assessment from 2015 .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The private firm which tests benefits claimants to see if they are fit to work has quit its £500million . contract after claiming its staff received death threats. Days after ministers said Atos Healthcare was 'committed' to its contract, the French IT company confirmed it was pulling out early. It follows mounting criticism about its treatment of sick and disabled people lose benefits, including cutting benefits unfairly and ordering a woman in a coma to attend jobs courses. Protesters hold placards outside Atos's London headquarters in August 2012 . The Department for Work and Pensions insisted it had achieved a good deal, with Atos paying to get out of the contract. It had been due to carry out Work Capability Assessments until August 2015. Ministers stressed that Atos will not receive any compensation from the taxpayer for the early termination of the contract, and had made a ""substantial"" financial settlement to the DWP. Claimants undergo a Work Capability Assessment when applying for Employment and Support Allowance, to see how their illness or disability affects their ability to work. The DWP said last summer it had identified 'significant quality failures' in the written reports produced by Atos following assessments. An improvement plan was put in place, but the Government said it was now looking for a new provider to replace Atos. The . DWP said to ensure a smooth transition, one national provider will be . appointed early next year to take over the contract. In the longer term . it is intended to move to multiple providers to increase competition. Disability minister Mike Penning insisted the government had secured a good deal, with Atos paying to exit the contract early . Mike Penning, Minister for Disabled People, said: 'The previous government appointed Atos as the sole provider for carrying out Work Capability Assessments and since then we have carried out several independent reviews and made significant improvements to the assessment. 'Today we are announcing that we are seeking a new provider to replace Atos, with the view to increasing the number of assessments and reducing waiting times. 'I am pleased to confirm that Atos will not receive a single penny of compensation from the taxpayer for the early termination of their contract, quite the contrary, Atos has made a substantial financial settlement to the department.' Atos has regularly come under fire over the assessments – which are . used to gauge eligibility for employment and support allowance and . incapacity benefit – amid claims people are being wrongly recommended . for work or put through stressful medical interviews. One . third of its decisions have been overturned on appeal and the firm has . become a lightning rod for Left-wing critics of the Government’s welfare . reforms. But it has warned of the impact of staff who have been threatened for their decisions. Each month last year they recorded about 160 incidents of the public assaulting or abusing staff, the Financial Times reported. Protests . had erupted outside their offices this week, when staff received deaths . threats in person and on Facebook  and Twitter. Examples . on social networking sites include someone calling staff ‘murdering . scumbags’, adding: ‘We won’t be smiling when we come to hang you . b******s.’ Another said: ‘Know anyone who works for Atos? Kill them.’ Labour's Kate Green  said: 'People have been badly let down by Atos which is why Labour has repeatedly called on the Government to sack them with immediate effect. 'But changing the contract isn’t enough. It’s time for the Government to reform fundamentally Work Capability Assessments so that disabled people who can work are given support they need to find a job.' Steve Winyard, RNIB's Head of Campaigns and Policy, said: 'Atos were part of a wider system and process problem. 'It's departure might be welcomed by some but it leaves blind, partially sighted and other disabled people in a very uncertain situation. 'DWP will face lots of questions but it also has an opportunity to re-examine the whole process. Blind and partially sighted people need to know what further delays will now be experienced in seeking an assessment or accessing support to find work. People already face months of delays and RNIB would urge DWP to work quickly to ensure people needing support are not left in limbo.'","Atos Healthcare quits contract after claiming staff were abused .

"By . Ted Thornhill . The corpse of a 66-year-old German woman who died more than six months ago was found in her apartment in front of a television set that was still on. The woman, in the town of Oberursel near Frankfurt, died of natural causes in a nightgown while watching TV on the sofa. There was a programme guide from September nearby, the lights were still on and her body was described in one report as being partially mummified. Grim: Police found the corpse of the 66-year-old woman in front of a flickering TV at her house in Oberursel (file picture) Neighbours called police when they noticed that her letterbox was overflowing, the Frankfurter Neue Presse newspaper said on Tuesday. Officers broke the door down and made the grim discovery. Tragically, the death showed that very few people visited the woman. Chief Inspector Ulrich Demmer of Hesse police department told the paper: â€˜Someone should have noticed. Unfortunately, societal and demographic changes mean that such cases are increasing.â€™ . Tragic: The woman had died of natural causes and police found a TV listings guide from September open near her body (file picture) Meanwhile, earlier this year the mummified remains of a woman who died around six years ago were found in a car at a suburban Detroit home. Investigators believe the remains belong to 49-year-old Pia Farrenkopf, but the identity hasn't been settled. There's evidence of extensive dental work, and the Oakland County medical examiner believes dental records could quickly confirm a name. But authorities don't know the dentists who treated Farrenkopf. The body was found in the rear seat of Farrenkopf's Jeep in her garage in Pontiac. There is no evidence of foul play.","Neighbours called police when they noticed the letterbox overflowing .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Tony Blair has used secret talks to urge Michael Gove to face down opposition to his radical education reforms. The former Labour Prime Minister has held at least two meetings in recent months with the Conservative Education Secretary urging him to press ahead in the face of criticism, including from the Labour party. The private support from such a surprising quarter has emboldened the Tory minister to go further in his plans to overhaul the English education system. Mr Blair has also privately dismissed Ed Miliband's current education strategy as 'bunkum'. Tory Education Secretary Michael Gove has been buoyed by the support of ex-Labour PM Tony Blair . The disclosure of an alliance between the two men is likely to provoke deep unease in today’s Labour party, which has sought to turn Mr Gove into public enemy number one. While Mr Gove has previously confessed to being a Blairite, it will prove highly controversial for Mr Miliband that his predecessor is offering advice to the Tories. To add to the division Mr Blair has previously dismissed Labour’s current education policy of ‘standards not structures’ as empty rhetoric which failed to deliver results when he was in power. Mr Blair is known to be an ardent supporter of Mr Gove’s academies programme, freeing schools from local authority control. Bunkum: Labour's shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt has said his policy is focused on 'standards not structures' - something Mr Blair has dismissed as pointless rhetoric . He has also hailed free schools as a . ‘great idea’ and accused the teaching unions of standing against . ‘necessary educational change’. By contrast Tristram Hunt, the current shadow education secretary in Mr Miliband’s team, has condemned much of what Mr Gove is doing. Last week in a Commons debate Mr Hunt insisted: ‘The first plank in Labour’s schools policy is to focus on standards and not structures. ‘We do not think that the job is done simply because a school has changed its name to that of an academy or a free school. ‘We think that the most important relationship is between a teacher and a pupil, and we would therefore ensure that all teachers in state-funded schools were qualified or working towards qualified teacher status.’ But Mr Blair has already rubbished the ‘standards not structures’ mantra as a good soundbite which ignores the need for better structures to improve standards. Writing in his 2010 autobiography A Journey, Mr Blair wrote: ‘We had come to power in 1997 saying it was “standards not structures” that mattered. ‘This was fine as a piece of rhetoric; and positively beneficial as a piece of politics. Unfortunately, as I began to realise when experience started to shape our thinking, it was bunkum as a piece of policy. The whole point is that structures beget standards. How service is configured affects outcomes.’ In a major speech yesterday Mr Gove set out plans to raise standards in state schools so they become indistinguishable from private schools. He suggested that a London state school Thomas Jones primary school in West London - where most children are brought up with English as a foreign language - offers a better education than the private Wetherby School attended by Princes William and Harry just around the corner. Mr Gove used a speech yesterday to set out plans to break down the 'Berlin wall' between state and private schools . Labour's education spokesman Tristram Hunt:‘The first plank in Labour’s schools policy is to focus on standards and not structures. We think that the most important relationship is between a teacher and a pupil, and we would therefore ensure that all teachers in state-funded schools were qualified or working towards qualified teacher status.' January 2014 . Former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair: ‘We had come to power in 1997 saying it was “standards not structures” that mattered... This was fine as a piece of rhetoric; and positively beneficial as a piece of politics. Unfortunately, as I began to realise when experience started to shape our thinking, it was bunkum as a piece of policy.'September 2010 . Mr Gove vowed to ‘break down the Berlin wall’ between state and private schools to drive up standards. He . proposed state schools checking 13-year-olds’ progress by making them . sit the Common Entrance exam, which is used by leading private schools . to select pupils. The school day could be lengthened to up to 10 hours to improve academic performance and offer more activities including cadets, choir and sport. And he urged a return to old-fashioned discipline, including writing lines, sweeping up and removing graffiti. But once again Mr Hunt’s response to the wide-ranging speech focussed on Labour’s policy that every teacher should be qualified and registered. He said: ‘Improving school standards starts with a qualified teacher in every classroom. Until Michael Gove commits to this, he is ruling himself out of any serious debate about how we raise standards in our schools.’ A source close to Mr Gove: ‘Hunt is turning out to be a one-trick pony. He’s got nothing to say on the longer school day, discipline or rigour. ‘Instead he trots out the same hypocritical policy on teacher qualifications that would deny ordinary kids at state school the top class education he enjoyed.’ Mr Gove is not the only Conservative member of the Government linked to Mr Blair. George Osborne, the Chancellor, was reported to have referred to Mr Blair as 'the master' and used his memoir as a reference book for reform.","Ex-Labour PM has held two meetings with Tory Education Secretary .

"By . Chris Greenwood . Ibrahim Bundu processed 28 bogus housing applications over a period of three years, in what has been labelled one of the biggest frauds of its kind ever uncovered . A corrupt town hall official gave sought-after council homes to family members and illegal immigrants in return for tens of thousands of pounds in backhanders. Ibrahim Bundu, who worked in a council’s homelessness unit, pocketed up to £4,000 a time for helping people jump the queue by faking documents and medical records. He arranged for homes for members of his extended family, including his mother, wife and ex-wife, in a scam which cost taxpayers at least £3.7million. Bundu himself netted at least £50,000. Investigators found he was behind 28 bogus applications in Southwark, South London, where more than 20,000 people are on the local authority’s waiting list. Many of those helped by Bundu, 50, were from the war-torn country of Sierra Leone, from where he had travelled to Britain in 1988. Yesterday the former car mechanic was jailed for four years for the ‘audacious’ scam, believed to be one of the biggest of its kind. Sentencing him at Woolwich Crown Court, Judge Douglas Marks Moore said his actions ‘undermined the trust’ necessary for ‘the functioning of our society.’ He said: ‘It was a hugely organised, premeditated system that was in place and you were instrumental in its development. Ibrahim Bundu's mother Marie Bundu who received a suspended sentence for her part in the scam . ‘Due to your position of . responsibility and insider knowledge, you knew the requirements for . applications to succeed. It is hard to over-estimate the scale of your . criminality. ‘You did not do this for purely altruistic reasons as you received significant financial benefit, a minimum of £53,000. ‘The message must go out that those in a position of trust who commit crimes will be dealt with by the courts.’ Bundu, who worked for Southwark Council, created false identities to ensure his applicants jumped the two-year waiting list. He forged reams of hospital records, birth certificates, employment papers and tax records to create realistic case files. In . return he pocketed cash bungs from relatives and others, including a . large number of people who were in the country illegally. Rebecca Quaty, 39, was also sentenced to eight months in prison, suspended for two years, and 200 hours of unpaid work . The . racket continued for three years and came to light in 2011 when data . from the Audit Commission revealed one of his tenants was entirely . bogus. An internal fraud . inquiry uncovered a paper trail of false documents which led to dozens . of other fraudulent cases co-ordinated by Bundu. Checks . by the UK Border Agency and HMRC revealed a number of applications had . resulted in homes being given to people not legally allowed to be in the . UK. House prices in Southwark  average £460,000, putting the total value of homes handed out at more than £10million. Michael . Goodwin, prosecuting, said: ‘He was paid £1,000 to £4,000 a go. This he . put into a saving account and kept it there earning interest. ‘For . every day one of the bogus applicants was in the house, the council was . losing money as they would have to home people in  private . accommodation.’ His ex-wife Ada Kamara, 43 was sentenced to eight months in prison suspected for two years and placed under curfew for six months from 9pm to 6am .

"By . Richard Spillett . Cllr Peter Lagoda remains a Cambridgeshire County Councillor despite being given a community sentence for a £25,000 benefit fraud . A former Ukip county councillor and his wife have escaped jail despite swindling nearly £25,000 in a two-year benefit fraud. Cllr Peter Lagoda and wife Maria, both 59, initially denied the charges against them but changed their plea at the start of their trial last month. The pair admitted giving Fenland District Council a false address in a bid to cash in on extra benefits. Lagoda had claimed he lived in a house in South Beach, Cambridgeshire, when in fact he shared a property in Wisbech with his then-girlfriend, now wife. Peterborough Crown Court had heard the dishonesty stretched for more than two years between June 2008 and November 2010. The false representation allowed the couple to falsely claim around £11,565 in income support, £2,346 in council tax and £10,949 in housing benefit. Returning to court for a sentencing hearing today, Lagoda and his wife were told they would not face a custodial sentence. Instead, they were each handed a 12-month community order by Judge Sean Enright. Lagoda was elected to represent Wisbech South on Cambridgeshire County Council in May last year. But he was suspended from UKIP after being charged by Cambridgeshire police in connection with the fraud. County Council leader Cllr Martin Curtis said the disgraced representative should now do the right thing and resign. Cllr Lagoda and his wife Maria pocketed £25,000 in extra benefits after failing to tell authorities they were living together . He told MailOnline: 'He stood for election knowing this was hanging over him so from my perspective he deceived the electorate. 'In my view, many of them would not have voted for him they knew this was hanging over him. 'It is quite clear that this is a man that does not have the qualities to be a councillor and should not be one. 'This was not a mistake or misunderstanding, he admitted making a representation he knew to be false. 'It sets a poor example and damages the reputation of councillors as a whole.' Council protocol means Lagoda's sentence is not serious enough to debar him from staying on. A council spokesman said today: 'Cllr Lagoda’s status as a councillor remains unchanged. As such it would be wrong for the authority to comment any further.' Lagoda's suspension from Ukip came after he admitted having described one of his north African relatives as a 'w*g' and German relatives as 'Mongols' whose children have 'slanty eyes'. On a visit to a fire station, he said: 'Yes, my cousin married Mongols and now all their little children are ever so cute and they have slanty eyes.' He later described the reaction to his comments as 'ridiculously over the top' and insisted his words had been taken out of context. When contacted after today's hearing, Lagoda refused to comment.","Peter Lagoda and his wife claimed they were living apart to get extra benefits .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A career criminal and his girlfriend gutted the flat they were renting, stripping all the copper pipes from under the floorboards within a fortnight of moving in. These pictures reveal the scale of the destruction wrought by John William Flounders and his partner Stacey Everett at the property in Stockton. A court heard the couple were given £200 to wallpaper and decorate their new home. Gutted: John Flounders and his girlfriend Stacey Everett, 20, moved into the flat in Stockton on September 16 last year. Two weeks later their landlord visited to find the couple gone and the flat completely gutted . Smashed: The couple ripped up the floorboards to steal copper piping valued at £1,000. And they tore the sink from the bathroom wall, leaving it smashed on the floor . Trashed: The work surfaces in the kitchen were wrenched from the cupboards . But instead they tore up the floorboards, pulled the sink from the bathroom wall and wrenched the kitchen work top from the cabinets. The heating and water system was destroyed, after the couple stole metres of copper piping from underneath the flooring. Teeside Crown Court heard the couple went on to burgle a house. Repeat offender Flounders, 19, was yesterday jailed while his girlfriend Everett, 20, was spared a custodial sentence after the judge recognised her 'potential' as she pursues an engineering career. The court heard the couple signed their tenancy agreement on September 16 last year, days after Flounders was released from custody for a previous offence. Career criminal: Nineteen-year-old John William Flounders was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in a young offenders' institution . But a fortnight later their landlord visited the property only to discover the couple gone and the flat gutted. Prosecutor Ian Mullarkey said as well as the damage they left in their wake, the couple stole goods worth £1,000 - weighed at a scrap dealer three days before they were caught. The court heard the pair were overheard plotting to raid the home of a woman who lived in Stockton, while she was out of her house on October 6. They burgled the house that day and stole a £250 laptop, which they sold for £25, and two coin tins, leaving the homeowner terrified. When police officers charged the . pair, Flounders had to be restrained after launching at a detention . officer threatening to bite off his lips. He . spat at the officers, yelled racial abuse, threatened to punch them and . burn their houses down while shouting he hoped their mothers would . 'catch cancer and die'. Flounders and Everett, of North Ormesby, Middlesbrough, admitted theft and burglary. The . court heard Flounders had 32 previous convictions on his record, . including burglaries dating back to when he was 14 years old. The 19-year-old complained to the court that the flat had been 'unfurnished'. His barrister Stephen Constantine said: 'There isn't a single carpet in the premises. There isn't a stick of furniture. 'The bathroom needs completely redecorating.' The judge, Recorder Paul Camp, said: 'It doesn't look as though it's in bad condition, prior to what your clients did to it. The defendants laid waste to it.' Disgrace: When police officers charged the pair, Flounders had to be restrained after launching at a detention officer threatening to bite off his lips. He spat at the officers, yelled racial abuse, threatened to punch them and burn their houses down . Cofession: The pair pleaded guilty to theft and burglary at Teeside Crown Court . Spared: Everett, 20, was spared a custodial sentence when the judge gave her a 13-month prison sentence but suspended it for a year. The judge ordered she complete 240 hours' unpaid work . Mr Constantine said the burglary was opportunistic to an extent and not significantly planned. He added Flounders had lived an ""itinerant"" lifestyle and would benefit from mental health help. The judge sent Flounders to a young offenders' institution for two-and-a-half years. Everett had only previous conviction for handling stolen goods and a caution for burglary. Catherine Fagan, representing Everett, said she was a bright girl who achieved four As at A-level and was working towards her future in engineering. She acknowledged her responsibility, apologisng in court. She said she has since split from Flounders. She was given a 13-month custodial sentence suspended for a year and ordered to undertake 240 hours' unpaid work.","John William Flounders and Stacey Everett admitted theft and burglary .

"By . Mark Duell . A 7ft 2in criminal has been released from custody after a judge accepted prison beds and uniforms were too small for him. Jude Medcalf, 23, of Newton Abbot, Devon, committed a spate of crimes after being diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome, a rare growth disorder which means he is still growing. He terrified an innocent woman by firing a BB gun at her through a window, and then went on to steal £30 of Christmas presents and £20 tea money from an NHS office, Exeter Crown Court heard. Too big for prison: Jude Medcalf, 23, of Newton Abbot, Devon, committed a spate of crimes . Medcalf was later found with stolen food - including a large amount of rump steak, which was taken from The Sloop pub in Newton Abbot while it was open and staff were distracted, the court was told. He was freed from jail after the court was told he had already spent 75 days in custody. He had faced problems throughout his time in custody because there were no beds or uniforms to fit him. Medcalf - who has also been diagnosed with a chromosomal disorder that gives him adolescent emotions – got a six-month curfew and 12-month community order after being held on remand. Brian Fitzherbert, prosecuting, said that when Medcalf saw his girlfriend calling the police after he had attacked an acquaintance's car in Torquay, he fired the BB gun at her, which cracked a window. ‘The woman was left feeling very frightened,’ Mr Fitzherbert said. ‘When the gun was pointed at her she did not know it was not real and feared for her life.’ Sentencing: Exeter Crown Court (pictured) heard how he terrified an innocent woman by firing a BB gun at her through a window, and then went on to steal Christmas presents and tea money from an NHS office . Medcalf admitted possession of an imitation firearm and a bladed article, criminal damage and burglary at an earlier hearing. He had been remanded in custody for sentencing. 'He is a target because he is big enough to be seen as someone who it is impressive to assault, but immature enough that he cannot deal with it' William Parkhill, defending . William Parkhill, defending, said Medcalf had been unable to access the specialist medical and psychiatric treatment he needed since his ‘tragic’ diagnosis. He said: ‘He has spent 75 days in prison on remand and he is not somebody who copes well because of the physical aspects in terms of accommodation, bedding and clothing. ‘He is also a target because he is big . enough to be seen as someone who it is impressive to assault, but . immature enough that he cannot deal with it. ‘He has been targeted twice and had a black eye the last time he came to court.’ Theft: Medcalf was later found with stolen food - including a large amount of rump steak, which had been taken from The Sloop pub (pictured) in Newton Abbot, the court was told . Defendant: Medcalf admitted possession of an imitation firearm and a bladed article, criminal damage and burglary at an earlier hearing. He had been remanded in custody for sentencing . Confined: A typical prison cell, with a bed that would be deemed too small for Medcalf . Recorder Adam Vaitilingam QC said he was . tempted to pass a lengthy jail sentence, but he accepted Medcalf ‘had a . lot of difficulty in life’, and that his condition had caused people to . pick on him. Klinefelter syndrome was first diagnosed in 1942 by Dr Harry Klinefelter at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Victims often develop enlarged breasts, have sparse facial and body hair, small testes, and an inability to produce sperm. Men with the condition often grow to 6ft or 6ft 2in, but the Klinefelter Syndrome Association said it knows only of two men - including Medcalf - with it who have grown to 7ft. Sufferers tend to have gender issues because they have an extra chromosome, which is a woman's chromosome. They also suffer from skeletal difficulties - problems with their bones. Mr Vaitilingam told the defendant: ‘You have had chances in the past and not taken them so the temptation is to pass a lengthy sentence. ‘I have taken into account the 75 days you have already spent in custody and accept that you have had a difficult time for the reasons your solicitor has explained. ‘In the pre-sentence report the probation service argue strongly for a non-custodial sentence and point out you have had a lot of difficulty in life. ‘You have recently been diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome, which has no doubt caused you problems throughout your life with people picking on you.’ Sue Cook, national coordinator at the Klinefelter Syndrome Association, said after the sentencing: ‘Sufferers develop a very aggressive side and a few do get into trouble with the law. ‘If someone has the condition, this should definitely be taken into account when sentencing. Klinefelter Syndrome is not rare. It is very common. It affects one in 600 live births.' A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said: 'The appeal against the decision of the district judge has been withdrawn as we did not serve notice of the appeal on the defence within the strict time limits necessary.'","Jude Medcalf diagnosed with rare growth disorder Klinefelter syndrome .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A speech to incoming college freshmen that was hailed by major news networks as the most 'epic' of all time was apparently partially plagiarized. Nick Selby, a student at Georgia Tech, lifted part of the speech from his high school debate coach, Andy Stone, who gave a similar address in 2008 that is available on YouTube, Gawker reported. Like Stone, Selby used theme music from '2001: A Space Odyssey' to punctuate the climax of his speech and he used similar phrasing, though the speeches were about two different subjects. Scroll down for video... Starts slow: Georgia Tech sophomore Nick Selby's freshman welcome speech began with typical advice then became an unforgettable address like none other . 'If you want to play theme music during your [speech], that's allowed! I can do that! I am doing that!' Stone shouts during his 2008 speech, in which he encouraged students to 'rescue' science fiction. Similarly, Selby said in his speech to Georgia Tech freshmen: 'If you want to play theme music during your convocation speech like a badaas, you can do that! You're at Georgia Tech! I am doing that!' Selby claims that he asked Stone's permission to lift those phrases from his speech. Selby was a member of the Speech, Theater and Debate Company at Desert Vista High School and records show Stone became an assistant coach of the club in 2006. The rest of Selby's speech seems largely uninfluenced by Stone. He encourages freshmen ‘to do . the impossible' and 'crush the shoulders of the giants upon whom we stand.' ‘Our mission as students is NOT to follow in the footsteps of the astronauts, Nobel Prize Laureates, and president who graduated before us, but to EXCEED their footsteps,’ bellowed the mechanical engineering student. Youtube footage of the address garnered one million views a couple days after it was posted by user Andy Blanton. ‘If you want to change the world, you're at Georgia Tech, you can do that! If you want to build the Iron Man suit, you're at Georgia Tech—you can do that! If you want to play theme music during your convocation speech like a badass, we're at Georgia Tech—we can do that,’ he screamed. ‘I AM DOING THAT!’ With that bit of self-reference, Selby’s opus was nearly complete. The incoming freshman, all of them donning the school’s traditional yellow beanie, gave a brief and slightly confused ovation. 'Congratulations,' he smirked before marching off the stage. 'Brace yourselves for a hell of a ride on your way to becoming a hell of an engineer.' Case in point: 'If you wanna play theme music during your convocation speech like a badass, we're at Georgia Tech! We can do that! I AM DOING THAT!' Applause: The yellow beanie-wearing crowd of future engineers first gave confused, nervous applause, but eventually gave Selby the standing ovation he deserved . Selby’s popularity has quickly skyrocketed since his speech hit Youtube. He’s even a caught the eye of some female fans who see great potential in the humorous and brainy sophomore. A contributor to the blog The Frisky even wrote Selby an open love letter. Sorry ladies: The aspiring mechanical engineer has a girlfriend and the two appear quite cozy in Facebook photos . ‘Dear Nick,’ writes Julie Gerstein. ‘your speech was so powerful…that I now feel prepared to take on a new challenge: making you my boyfriend so hard.’ ‘I would like to stand on some giant shoulders with you,’ she went on. ‘Is that cool?’ Selby’s fandom has spread beyond bloggers, as well. Even ABC News anchor Diane Sawyer has confessed an appreciation for the future engineer. However, the instant celebrity appears to have a serious girlfriend. ‘Diane Sawyer just gave Nick a shout out, so I feel inadequate’ tweeted Katie Giel, who appears on both his Facebook page and her own looking quite cozy with Selby. ‘I feel like I'm dating a celebrity.’ Protective: 'I can't read these YouTube comments. I'm way too defensive of Nick,' Giel tweeted . Insecure? 'Diane Sawyer just gave Nick a shout out, so I feel inadequate' Giel joked on Twitter as her boyfriend's internet celebrity ballooned Tuesday .","Nick Selby, a student at Georgia Tech, lifted part of the speech from his high school debate coach, Andy Stone, who gave a similar address in 2008  that available on YouTube .

"By . Katy Winter . A mother's photographs of her five-year-old daughter have become an incredibly touching portrayal of her child's journey through cancer treatment. Zofeya Dorgu, from Dunstable, Bedfordshire, was diagnosed with medulloblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer, last July, and her mother has been charting her progress through treatment with photographs in a blog. A professional photographer, Noemi Dorgu made the brave decision to catalogue her daughter's experience of treatment as a way making sense of the shattering news, turning what was originally a way to keep friends and family informed into a lifeline for herself and others. Zofeya Dorgu was diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain  cancer when she was just four years old . Noemi decided to record her experience of Zofeya's treatment through daily photographs and a blog . Zofeya has begun to show an interest in her mother's photography, and Noemi feels they help her make sense of what has happened . Zofeya's symptoms were mainly a loss of balance, and the family never dreamed she could have a brain tumour . Zofeya underwent surgery 10 days after diagnosis to remove the tumour, and has been undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy . Zofeya clasps her father's hand as she undergoes chemotherapy, which she is having at Addenbrooke's hospital in Cambridge . 'It started as a way to keep everyone updated at the beginning. Everyone texts, and of course they mean well, but you don't know how to reply, so we started a site to keep people up-to-date. 'But then it became a way of helping me work things out, to make sense of the situation. ‘You find yourself catapulted into this whole new world where even the terminology is alien. You have no control, you feel powerless. 'Being in the hospital all day with Zofeya, writing the blog was the only time I could sit alone and reflect on the day and what was happening in our lives.' A scan revealed a walnut-sized tumour in Zofeya's brain, catapulting the family into a world 'where you have no control' Zofeya has had several rounds of chemotherapy, and is due to continue until September this year . Noemi says she takes the photographs because 'there are some things you just can't put into words' Zofeya, Noemi, her husband Matthew Dorgu and their son Malacai, eight, have been provided with emotional and practical support from CLIC Sargent Social Worker Rachel Hall . Noemi says that she hopes one day the photos will help Zofeya understand the decisions they made for her . She added: 'I decided to be really honest in it. We are such a normal family that this happened to. If Zofeya or I have a bad day, I write about it.' A professional photographer who has now given up work to be Zofeya’s full-time carer, Noemi began to accompany the blog with pictures of Zofeya through treatment. ‘With the photos, for me, there are some things you just can’t put into words. ‘Some were hard to take, seeing your own child like that, especially after the operation when she was so very sick. ‘But the response has been amazing. It has shown me that when things get tough people show their very best side. It has really restored my faith in humanity. 'The support we have received from friends, family and strangers has been incredible. 'If our story helps anyone else in a similar situation, especially at the beginning, I’ll be overjoyed,' Noemi said. Zofeya . was diagnosed with medulloblastoma in July 2013, when she was four, . after her parents noticed she was becoming clumsy, tripping over and . bumping into things. They took her for a check-up with her GP and booked . her in for eyesight tests, presuming her problems stemmed from . poor vision. It didn't . occur to her parents that she may have a brain tumour as she showed no . other symptoms; she suffered her first headache only the day before . diagnosis.

She underwent surgery 10 days later to remove the tumour, and has been undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy since. So far she’s had several rounds of chemotherapy, which is due to continue until September this year. Before . her treatment, Zofeya had beautiful dark curly hair, which all began to . fall out when she started her chemo.

Before her treatment Zofeya had beautiful dark curly hair, which all began to fall out when she started her chemotherapy . Noemi says the support of friends, family, and strangers to the blog has been overwhelming . Zofeya is used to her mother, a passionate photographer, taking pictures of her . Noemi said that as her treatment continues, Zofeya has become more interested in her mother’s photography. ‘I became a professional photographer just weeks before Zofeya was diagnosed, but I've always loved photography and have taken loads of pictures, so she was very used to it. ‘At first I was careful not to show her any pictures from when she was really sick, but now she shows an interest in them. ‘They seem to help her make sense of what has happened to her. She sits and looks at one and will say “remember when that or this happened to me”. ‘I hope one day these pictures will help her understand the decisions we had to make as her parents about her treatment.' Zofeya, who turned five last Saturday and spent the day with her family - which Noemi documented on her blog - has responded well to treatment, though she remains on the journey to recovery. Zofeya, Noemi, her husband Matthew Dorgu and their son Malacai, eight, who live in Dunstable, in Bedfordshire, have been provided with emotional and practical support from CLIC Sargent Social Worker Rachel Hall who offers them advice and information on treatment.

Noemi said: 'Rachel came to us really early on and she was just there whenever we needed her, when we needed answers. She gave us advice about the medical processes and practical help and financial advice as well. 'Everything’s a bit overwhelming, and we were feeling overloaded with information which we didn’t fully understand; she was great at explaining things to us and letting us know how the whole process worked and what to expect. ‘The information that CLIC Sargent provided to us was brilliant. There’s a leaflet called Mary Has a Brain Tumour which we read to Malacai so he could understand what was happening to his sister.

He took a team from the hair transplant clinic he runs near Manchester Airport for the mercy mission last week. The skilled former NHS general surgeon had visited Karachi last year where he had met patients who required hair, eyebrow and eyelash transplants. Among those he helped were Kanwal Ashar, 24, who had acid thrown over her by a man who had been stalking her after she turned down his proposal. She had been working in a beauty salon and the man became obsessed by her. Dr . Shahmalak gave her two new eyebrows and a right eyelash with hair . transplanted from the back of her head in a series of intricate . operations performed over three days. Shabana, 19, pictured, was accidentally burned with boiling water when she sat her mother's lap aged just two months . He took a team from the hair transplant clinic he runs near Manchester Airport for the mercy mission last week . Dr Shahmalak said some of the victims were attacked with sulphuric acid which can be bought  for as little as 15p a bottle on the back streets of Karachi where the women live . She has not worked since the attack three years ago and she hopes that the surgery will help her to rebuild her life. Fellow victim Kanwal Qayum, 26, was . also doused in acid after telling a jealous former friend that she was . starting a new job as an air hostess. The Acid Survivors Trust International (ASTI) estimates there are approximately 1,500 acid attacks a year globally. Acid violence is a worldwide phenomenon that is not restricted to a particular race, religion or geographical location. It occurs in many countries in South-East Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, the West Indies and the Middle East, and there is anecdotal evidence of attacks in other regions. In many countries acid attacks constitute a hidden form of violence against women and children that often goes unreported, and the true number of horrific attacks taking place has only come to light after in-depth research.Source: Acid Survivors Trust International . He attacked her in her sleep and she has previously had extensive surgery on her face and neck as she recovers from her wounds. She had also had temporary ‘tattooed’ eyebrows to cover up her lack of brows. Dr Shahmalak gave her two new eyebrows - again using hair harvested from the back of her scalp. Asma, 22, was horrifically scarred three years ago after falling into pan of boiling fat when she slipped in the kitchen. She had a new right eyebrow and a right eyelash transplanted by Dr Shahmalak and his team from the Crown Clinic in Manchester. The surgeon also transplanted new hair on a bald patch of scarring at the front of her scalp. Shabana, . 19, was accidentally burned with boiling water when she sat her . mother’s lap aged just two months. Dr Shahmalak did reconstruction work . on her right eyebrow and transplanted fresh hair on a bald patch on her . scalp. The hero medic . is one of only nine surgeons in the world qualified to do the kind of . intricate eyelash and eyebrow transplants the women needed. Dr Shahmalak, a father-of-two from Cheadle, Greater Manchester, said he was moved to tears by the women's stories . 'Doused with acid because you turn down a man's proposal - people were treated better in the Middle Ages,' he said . Dr Shahmalak said that he had investigated the availability of sulphuric acid while he was in Karachi and found it could be bought for as little as 15p a bottle near to where he performed surgery on the women . It will take at least six months for the women’s new eyebrows, eyelashes and transplanted hair to grow back fully. The . new eyelashes and the eyebrows will grow back as a normal hair because . it has been transplanted from the scalp - meaning the women will need to . trim it regularly and also curl their new eyelashes. All the operations were carried out at the Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation in Karachi. Dr Shahmalak, a father-of-two from Cheadle, Greater Manchester, said he was moved to tears by the women’s stories. He said: 'I wept when I heard what had happened to these women. 'Scarred for life because you want to better yourself and work as an air hostess. Dr Shahmalak is best know in the UK for his work with celebrities at his world-renowned transplant centre, Crown Clinic, in Manchester . 'Doused with acid because you turn down a man’s proposal - people were treated better in the Middle Ages. 'It . was incredibly moving to see the smiles on their faces after we . performed the surgery. They had given up hope of ever getting help . because the Government in Pakistan cannot afford to do anything for . them. We were their last hope. 'They . are not accepted by society because of their disfigurement. They cannot . get jobs and, in some case, they have been disowned by their families . and left to beg on the streets. 'They . are too frightened of reprisals to tell the police who has attacked . them and even if they did, they have no faith that the culprits will be . brought to justice.' Dr Shahmalak said that he had investigated the availability of sulphuric acid while he was in Karachi and found it could be bought for as little as 15p a bottle near to where he performed surgery on the women. He said: 'It easy to buy with no questions asked. And as long as the authorities turn a blind eye to horrific cases like these, the attacks will continue.' Dr Shahmalak worked with the Karachi-based charity Smile Again which had found patients needing surgery. One such case was a six-year-old girl doused with acid by her father for refusing to go to school who, sadly, was too young to help. Dr Shahmalak is best know in the UK for his work with celebrities at his world-renowned transplant centre, Crown Clinic, in Manchester. He has performed transplants on Christian Jessen from the TV medical show Embarrassing Bodies and the model Calum Best.","Asim Shahmalak spent £50,000 of his money to rebuild lives of six women .

"By . Fiona Macrae, Science Correspondent . Lovers of organic chocolate will find this hard to swallow – but there is no evidence that it is any better for the environment than conventional bars. Oxford University scientists say organic farming clearly helps wildlife threatened by intensive agriculture in developed countries. However, the jury is still out on the Third World where virgin land may be cleared for crops such as cocoa beans and bananas. While organic chocolate is a popular choice, it could be having a negative impact on Third World countries . This land is likely to be home to more plants, animals and other wildlife when wild then when farmed. And as organic farms often need more land than conventional ones, organic chocolate may not be as green as believed. Lindsay Turnbull, of Oxford University’s department of plant sciences, said: ‘More research is needed on the impact of farming in tropical and subtropical regions. ‘For example, there are no studies on organic bananas or cocoa beans, two of the most popular organic products found in European supermarkets. ‘At present, we simply cannot say whether buying organic bananas or chocolate has any environmental benefit.’ Dr Turnbull spoke out after crunching together data from almost 100 studies into the wildlife present on different types of farm. Almost 80 per cent of organic farming happens in less developed nations, but almost no data exists about the impact of organic farming in these countries . On average, organic farms, which typically grow their crops without the aid of pesticides, artificial fertilisers and intensive farming techniques had a 34 per cent more species of plants, insects and birds than conventional farms. In some cases, the increase in biodiversity, or number of species, was as high as 43 per cent. Writing in the Journal of Applied Ecology, Dr Turnbull and colleague Sean Tuck said: ‘Organic farming is a tried and tested method for increasing biodiversity on farmlands and may help reverse the declines of formerly common species in developed nations.’ However, most of the data came from the Europe, despite three-quarters of organic farming done elsewhere and Dr Turnbull said we cannot assume the same applies all over the world. The Soil Association said that organic farming brings other benefits, such as a drop in the use of toxic pesticides. It added that large-scale studies have shown that the practice has ‘huge benefits’ in developing countries.","Chocolate and bananas are two most popular organic products .

"By . Bianca London . Whether she’s strutting her stuff on the catwalk or posing for yet another selfie, Cara Delevingne is undoubtedly comfortable in her own skin and never afraid to go make-up free. But a hectic modelling schedule and infamous late night partying antics must take its toll on her skin. And now, FEMAIL can reveal the £180 treatment that helps keep her supermodel skin in check. So THAT's her secret! Cara has £180 111 SKIN Micropen Facials at 111 Harley Street to keep her complexion fresh . 21-year-old Cara is a huge fan of 111 SKIN Micropen Facials at 111 Harley Street, which she indulges in regularly. The 111SKIN Micropen Facial involves three key stages. First, a therapist cleanses and massages Cara's face using intensive 111SKIN products. The vital stage of the facial, which claims to give Cara that catwalk glow, is achieved with the Dermapen, an electric micro-needling device used to combat pigmentation, fine lines, open pores and uneven skin tone. Hectic lifestyle: Cara, who is currently juggling her modelling, musical and acting responsibilities, is a fan of the treatment because it only takes an hour, so she can pop in on a lunch break . The micro pen works with the skin’s natural repair system by making tiny punctures to stimulate cell regeneration, but is gentle enough for use around the delicate eye area. When the needles enter the skin, there is a tingling sensation - but no real pain, apparently. After microneedling is complete, the 111SKIN Bio Cellulose Face Mask is applied to Cara's skin to soothe and hydrate, followed by a revitalising neck and shoulder pressure point massage. Cara, who is currently busy juggling modelling, musical and acting careers, is a fan of the treatment because it only takes an hour, so she can pop in on a lunch break. Cara is currently filming Kids In Love, as well as The Face Of An Angel, a film which touches upon the murder of British student Meredith Kercher and the trial of Amanda Knox. Over the weekend she joined showbiz friend Miley Cyrus in Amsterdam where the pair made a late-night stop at a famed Amsterdam coffee shop, according to witnesses. The . friends allegedly sat down down just after 11pm and emerging two hours looking quite relaxed . despite the camera presence outside.

"By . David Mccormack . A Good Samaritan who followed a drunk man out of a Chicago bar and attempted to reason with him not to drive was tragically killed as a result of attempted good dead. Shane Stokowski, 33, was enjoying drinks with friends at the Aberdeen Tap on Saturday at 5pm when he noticed another man – clearly inebriated – start to leave after being refused further drinks. Stokowski followed Timothy McShane, who had a suspended driver’s license and previous DUI arrests, into the bar’s parking lot. Shane Stokowski, 33, was tragically killed after he tried to prevent a drunk driver from leaving the car park of a Chicago bar in his vehicle . He watched as McShane, 42, got into his girlfriend's black SUV and hit several parked cars trying to leave, according to court documents. Stokowski approached the SUV and leaned into the driver's side window to stop McShane but he kept driving, carrying Stokowski along for nearly a block before he fell and struck his head on the pavement, prosecutors say. He was rushed to hospital, but died less than an hour later of blunt trauma to the head and abrasions from the pavement, reports the Chicago Sun Times. Instead of stopping or contacting police, McShane, a construction worker, drove to his girlfriend’s house, parked her Nissan Murano and fell asleep for three hours. Timothy McShane, 42, had a suspended driver¿s license and previous DUI arrests. He told police that Stokowski had tried to attack him and that he fled in fear . When police found him at 10pm, McShane told them that Stokowski had tried to attack him and that he fled in fear, according to a police report. McShane, a father of one, also told officers that Stokowski tried to rob and beat him and made a mark on his neck, the report said. The man was taken to a local police station and even at 1:06 am on Sunday McShane’s blood-alcohol level was still .225, more than twice the state’s legal .08 limit. McShane is being held in lieu of $350,000 bail for reckless homicide, aggravated DUI and leaving the scene of an accident. He has a list of prior DUI offenses dating back to 1993. Stokowski, who was engaged to be married, worked as an animator and illustrator for a health care company. His funeral will take place on Friday.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Lumumba was held in custody for two weeks after Knox, 26, told police she had 'covered her ears as he killed' Meredith in her bedroom of the house she shared with her fellow student in Italy. As a result of the false accusation, Lumumba was dragged from his home in front of his children and wife in a dawn raid and taken to jail only being released when a university professor provided him with a rock solid alibi. Guilt: Amanda Knox has spoken of her regret at falsely accusing Congolese barman Patrick Lumumba of the murder of British student Meredith Kercher in Italy . Falsely accused: Lumumba was held in custody for two weeks because of Knox's claims - he later won damages for the ordeal . Knox in 2007 with then boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, who was also reconvicted of Meredith's murder last month . Now Knox, who was last month re-convicted along with ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito for Meredith's killing in Perugia in 2007, has admitted her guilt at accusing Lumbumba, which she has always claimed was as a result of pressure from police. In a wide-ranging interview with the Guardian, she told how she has 'really struggled with what happened with Patrick' and, asked if she could understand why he hated her, replied: 'Yes, Patrick was greatly hurt by what happened and never got answers from me. 'Granted, I was in a position where I couldn't give answers. But if you read what I said after my interrogations, I said I could not testify against him, and yet his lawyer continues to say I was going to let him languish in prison...' Knox said her false confession was as a result of threats from police and the mental strain caused by their interrogations. Tragic: Knox says she still hopes to convince the Kercher family of her innocence and said she was still 'traumatised' by Meredith's death . Recalling the moment she made her false accusation, she said: 'When I named Patrick, I just started weeping. I thought, ""Oh my God"", it must be true what they're (the police) saying. I must have witnessed my friend's murder somehow and now I'm traumatised enough to not even remember it.' Knox was convicted of slandering Lumumba and ordered to pay him 22,000 euros in 2011, and he was also later awarded 8,000 euros in damages by the Italian state but he rejected this to pursue a claim through the European Court of Human Rights. Knox, who was this week given a lifeline when it emerged the judge who convicted her of the crime for a second time may have breached legal rules, also spoke of her determination to convince the Kercher family of her innocence, although she admitted it was a 'really big rock to overturn'. The Seattle native, who is back studying in her home city, said she felt stranded and trapped by the latest verdict and was uncomfortable that the decision of a judge had cemented her reputation as a criminal in the eyes of the public. She also said it was a struggle when meeting people at her college when new acquaintances realised her identity. Knox, who maintains police have not a shred of evidence that she committed any crime, added she was trying to stay positive about her future. Knox is trying to build a new life back in America with boyfriend James Terrano . Knox and Sollecito were charged with murdering and sexually assaulting Meredith in 2007, after she was found semi-naked and with her throat cut in the bedroom of her house in Perugia. Initially, both were convicted in 2009 and Knox was sentenced to 26 years and Sollecito to 25 years but then in 2011 the verdicts were sensationally overturned and both were allowed to go free. But last year, in a case that has been marked with numerous twists and turns, Italy's Supreme Court ordered a fresh retrial of the appeal and she was re-convicted last month. She's been warned she faces extradition to Italy if she leaves America.","Knox says she still 'struggles' at wrongly accusing Patrick Lumumba .

"By . Jill Reilly . Russia's counterterrorism agency has identified the two suicide bombers who struck the southern city of Volgograd and announced the arrest of two suspected accomplices. The bombings of a train station and trolley bus in Volgograd in late December, which killed 34 people and wounded many more, heightened security fears before the Winter Olympics in Sochi, which start next week. The suspected bombers, Asker Samedov and Suleiman Magomedov, were members of a terrorist group based in Dagestan, the National Anti-Terrorism Committee said. Russia's counterterrorism agency identified the two suicide bombers who struck the southern city of Volgograd and announced the arrest of two suspected accomplices . An ambulance leaves the site of an explosion after a bomb blast tore through a trolleybus in December . Two brothers, Magomednabi and Tagir Batirov, were detained as suspected accomplices Wednesday in Dagestan, a predominantly Muslim republic that has become the center of an Islamic insurgency. The brothers were believed to have helped the suicide bombers travel to Volgograd, about 650 kilometers (400 miles) to the north, the agency said in a statement. Investigators were still trying to determine who had organized the attack, the statement said. Members of Russia's special forces stand guard during an operation on suspected militants in Makhachkala, the capital of Russia's North Caucasus Republic of Dagestan . An Islamic jihadist group in Dagestan posted a video this month purporting to show the two suicide bombers speaking to the camera before the Volgograd attacks and threatening to strike Sochi, where the Winter Games will be held Feb. 7-23. The men were identified only as Suleiman and Abdurakhman. An Islamic jihadist group in Dagestan posted a video purporting to show the suicide bombers before the Volgograd attacks. The men were identified only as Suleiman and Abdurakhman . There has been no confirmation that the Suleiman in the video is the man named by the counter-terrorism agency or that either of the men carried out the suicide bombings. The video was released by the Vilayat Dagestan, one of the units that make up the Caucasus Emirate, an umbrella group for militants seeking to establish an independent Islamic state in Russia's North Caucasus. The volatile region, a patchwork of ethnic republics, is located just to the east of Sochi. Doku Umarov, a Chechen warlord who leads the emirate, had ordered a halt to attacks on civilian targets in 2012. But he rescinded that order in July, urging his followers to strike the Sochi Olympics, which he denounced as 'satanic dances on the bones of our ancestors.'

A mental health patient has told how she was raped up to 60 times by a care worker (stock picture) A mental health patient has described how she was raped up to 60 times by a care worker. The woman, who was groomed with gifts from the senior staff member, has branded psychiatric hospitals a ‘playground for predators’. She only built up the courage to speak out about the abuse after she was released from Little Brook Hospital in Dartford, Kent - and her abuser avoided a jail sentence. The woman, who has not been named, . has now called for better safeguards for mental health patients, who she describes as ‘the . most vulnerable in society in terms of being abused’. Speaking . on BBC Radio 5 Live’s Victoria Derbyshire show, which is to be broadcast today, she described how the . staff member would enter her room for sex on a nightly basis. She said he would give her gifts such as Valium, cigarettes and chocolate, according to the Mirror. The woman is now in her 40s and estimates she was raped 60 times. She was paid £100,000 compensation in 2003 and 2004. She said that the abuse built up until it was taking place up to six nights a week and described how she was told he would report her for good behaviour. ‘It was total manipulation. He was saying, “this is your way out”. At the time you believe anything,’ she said. ‘You latch on to that hope because you don’t have much hope in anything else. He would come in to my room every night and rape me. 'But who is going to believe a mental patient over a highly respected member of staff?’ The victim only built up the courage to speak out after she was released from Little Brook Hospital in Dartford . Meanwhile, she was told by doctors that if she attempted to leave the hospital she would be sectioned. The woman even got a sexually transmitted disease, but staff only became aware of the abuse when she was released from the home and gained the courage to report it. The care worker pleaded guilty to one act of unlawful sexual intercourse with a patient after being charged by police. He was given a 12-month sentence, suspended by two years, and told by Kent and Medway NHS Trust he should never work with vulnerable people again. The new trust said it was unable to comment because the offences occurred under the previous regime.","Patient at Little Brook Hospital in Dartford, Kent, has called for better safeguards for 'the most vulnerable in society in terms of being abused'

Weiner¿s disastrous bid to become New York mayor reflected badly on everyone associated with his campaign and that includes his wife Huma Abedin . ‘Huma has a choice to make,’ a close associate told New York magazine. 'Does she go with Anthony, or does she go with Hillary?' If, as anticipated, Hillary Clinton makes a run for the White House in 2016 she will not want to run the risk of having a political liability such as Weiner anywhere near her campaign team. Abedin is one of Clinton’s most trusted advisers and as a result they supported her decision to help with her husband’s political comeback. Her political know-how and contacts were credited with making Weiner seem like a credible candidate early in the campaign. Abedin is one of Hillary Clinton's most trusted advisers and would be expected to be a key part of her team if she enters the 2016 presidential race . He was even leading in the polls, until in July he was forced to admit he had continued sexting in 2012 using the name ‘Carlos Danger' after Sydney Leathers came forward with evidence. Abedin awkwardly stood by her . man as he made the confession - and even spoke out in favor of him - but she quickly caved in to pressure from the . Clinton camp. They feared she - and by extension the Clintons - were being tarnished by Weiner’s actions. In the end she didn’t even accompany him to the polls on election day . The Clinton camp felt it was blindsided by the ‘Carlos Danger’ revelations and Weiner has used up all the chances that they are willing to afford him. ‘Abedin has struggled to reconcile her marriage to Weiner with her role as Clinton’s top aide, traumatized by the prospect of leaving her boss’ inner circle,” the magazine reports, citing a person familiar with the situation. The candidate’s bird-flipping parting shot to reporters after his humiliating defeat this month made a bad situation even worse, according to New York.

"By . Louise Boyle . A desperate search is underway after a four-day-old baby went missing in the early hours today from the room where his mother and father were sleeping. The newborn's mother . called 911 after waking at 4.30am on Thursday to find her son Kayden . Powell missing from his bassinet in a room where she was sleeping at a . home in the Town of Beloit, Wisconsin. The 18-year-old mother, Brianna . Marshall, and the infant's 23-year-old father, Bruce Powell, were . staying at the house, said town police chief Steven Kopp. Missing: Kayden Powell, now five-days-old, disappeared from his bassinet in the early hours of yesterday . Reunited: Brianna Marshall and Bruce Powell, pictured shortly after Kayden's birth, are back with their son . Police reported on Thursday afternoon that a person of interest had been arrested in Iowa. That person is believed to be a relative, according to wqow. Kristin Smith was arrested in West Branch on fraud charges after a warrant was put out for her arrest in Texas. She has not been charged in the baby's disappearance but is due to be questioned by the FBI. Baby Kayden has still not been found but Smith was carrying baby clothing. She claims not to know what happened to the child. Smith claims to be Brianna Marshall's half-sister, with the women sharing the same father. The women had reportedly discussed moving to Colorado, along with Bruce Powell, after the baby was born. Chief Kopp confirmed that Smith left the home in the early hours of Thursday - before the mother reported the child missing. West Branch, Iowa is 170miles from Beloit - roughly a two and a half hour drive away. Fears: Brianna and Bruce had feared for their son's safety after waking to find he was missing . On the trail: A map shows the house Kayden was kidnapped from  and where he was later found . There were no signs of a break-in at the home and police said it was being processed as a crime scene. No one in or around the home reported anything suspicious, according to police reports. The . mother, who just turned 18, and father were at the police station . cooperating with police along with the mother's brother and a friend. They were all at the house on Wednesday night. The . homeowner of the property where the family were staying is listed as . 46-year-old Mark Bennett who has a history of arrests for battery and . criminal misdemeanors. The FBI and Wisconsin Department of Justice are helping local authorities in the search in Rock County. Search: Forty officers from law enforcement agencies have now joined in the search for missing Kayden . The Rock County Sheriff's Office had . provided 16 staff at the scene, including all members of its detective . bureau and its special investigations unit. Kopp says the incident is not . believed to be a custody dispute. The chief says an Amber Alert was not . issued because the disappearance doesn't meet the criteria. An Amber Alert is only issued if the child is at risk of serious injury . or death and there is sufficient descriptive information of child, . captor or captor's vehicle. The . baby was born at Beloit Memorial Hospital. He is African-American, 20 . inches long, 6 pounds, with brown hair and brown eyes, according to . police. Brianna Marshall, 18, called police after awaking around 4.30am and finding her newborn son missing from his bassinet . Scene: Baby Kayden was snatched from his crib at this Wisconsin home yesterday morning. Police say there were no signs of forced entry at the house, which is currently being processed as a crime scene .","The 18-year-old mother, Brianna .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Buying a home in Wales would be cheaper than in England under Tory plans to axe stamp duty on properties worth up to £250,000. Conservatives in Wales will today announce a policy to axe the 1 per cent levy, warning stamp duty pushes home ownership ‘dream further away’ for thousands of would-be first-time buyers. The move will heap pressure on Chancellor George Osborne to promise to do the same in England, or risk making it more costly to buy a home on different sides of the border. Under the plan drawn up by Tories i wales, the cost of buying a home in Wales would be higher than in England in an attempt to attract buyers to cross the border . Mr Osborne has used taxpayers money to guarantee billions of pounds in state-backed mortgages under the controversial Help to Buy scheme, to help people who only have a five per cent deposit to buy a home. But Tories in Wales want to go further, and propose using new powers devolved to Cardiff to cut stamp duty levied on properties worth between £125,000 and £250,000. Writing for MailOnline Andrew Davies, Welsh Conservative leader said: ‘For many without the Bank of Mum & Dad or who already pay expensive rents prohibiting saving, the costs of that initial leap onto the ladder remain unreachable. ‘Stamp duty pushes that dream further . away. On average for a 10 per cent deposit, stamp duty is equivalent to 3 . per cent on top.’ The . policy to scrap stamp duty in Wales would cost around £20million, but to . be replicated across England would cost hundreds of millions of pounds. The move would make it much cheaper for people trying to get their foot on the first run of the property ladder, at a time when values are soaring. Mr Osborne warned this week that the house price boom would last for another decade, with demand outstripping supply. House prices in Wales were up by 5.4 per cent in November, 11.6 per cent in London, 4.5 per cent in the South East and 4.4 per cent in the West Midlands . Chancellor George Osborne warned demand for homes would significantly outstrip supply for at least another 10 years . Prices in Wales are up more than 5 per cent, slightly lower than the average in England but well ahead of Scotland, Northern Ireland and the north West of England. Mr Davies added: ‘We want to make Wales a nation of home owners and a place of low tax and this is just one of the ways we can get there.’ The Tories are the second largest party in the Welsh Assembly, and the policy will almost certainly lead to calls for Labour to follow suit. When the Conservatives called for a stamp duty ‘holiday’ for first-time buyers before the 2010 election, then-Labour chancellor Alistair Darling quickly copied the policy. Moves to devolve tax powers to Cardiff make it possible for the first time that stamp duty rates could differ between England and Wales. The Wales Bill, which would hand control of stamp duty to Assembly members, is expected to pass into law this year. By ANDREW DAVIES, WELSH CONSERVATIVE LEADER . Andrew Davies, Tory leader in Wales, claims the stamp duty cut could revitalise Wales . The . property-owning democracy was one of Margaret Thatcher’s lasting . legacies. In today’s Wales of lower than UK average salaries and . expensive rental markets; this legacy is becoming less and less of a . possibility for many. Last . year, there were 13,000 house sales in the stamp duty bracket - £125,000 . to £250,000. With house prices on the rise again, houses that fall in . this bracket are no longer for the wealthy but for our aspirational and . those wanting to get onto the property ladder. This dream has become . more of a reality with the increase in 5 per cent deposit mortgage offers and . shared equity schemes, following the impressive lead of the UK . Government. However, for many without the Bank of Mum & Dad or who . already pay expensive rents prohibiting saving, the costs of that . initial leap onto the ladder remain unreachable. Stamp duty pushes that . dream further away. On average for a 10 per cent deposit, stamp duty is . equivalent to 3 per cent on top. Therefore, . the Welsh Conservatives are today pledging to abolish stamp duty on all . property in Wales up to a value of £250,000. We want to make Wales a . nation of home owners and a place of low tax and this is just one of the . ways we can get there. We would like to do this today, but we need to . wait until powers are devolved. Within . the next year, the Wales Bill – a UK Government bill which plans to . devolve stamp duty to the Welsh Assembly – will be passed, enabling . Wales to become a low tax destination. Since Welsh devolution began in . 1999, GVA has fallen to 72 per cent of the UK average and average wages and . house prices lag behind other parts of the UK. All this whilst Labour . has been at the helm of the Welsh economy for nigh on 15 years. In some . areas of Wales, builders are now turning their backs on building here . because of the cost of Welsh regulations and the lack of buoyancy in the . market. It is inevitable . that some in Wales will query the need for such a move, but that’s part . of the lack of imagination, not lack of possibility. In . a report written in June last year, it was suggested that reducing . stamp duty by just 1per cent can increase volumes by 20 per cent over a . very short period of time. At present levels, abolishing this band of . stamp duty would cost the Welsh exchequer around £20 million. However, . an increase in economic activity will increase tax takes. The . UK Government’s announcement to support 30 of the 31 recommendations of . the Silk Commission on further devolution shows the Conservative . commitment to Wales being a low tax country as a means to driving . entrepreneurial spirit and growing a Welsh economy that for too long has . been at the bottom of the UK’s competitiveness league tables. Last . week, a leading report showed significant evidence of ‘brain drain’ to . London and the South East, with clear routes from all parts of the UK. Nowhere was the route more trodden than between Wales and London. We all . know that the UK faces huge challenges in counter-balancing the huge . pull of London, yet in the case of Wales very few actually return. This . requires radical policy and I believe that by sounding the horn of low . tax, Wales could begin to reverse this decline. Becoming a place where . people believe enterprise thrives and is actively supported. I believe . the Welsh Conservatives are the only party to do that. What . an abolition of stamp duty would do is send a message to the strivers . and the ambitious that they can be better off in Wales. It won’t solve . all problems, but nor do I pretend it will. Sometimes in politics, small . changes can make very big differences.","Welsh Tories propose axing 1% stamp duty on sales of £125,000- £250,000 .

"By . Marie-louise Olson . and Louise Boyle . The family who discovered their 21-year-old daughter was fathered by a convicted kidnapper who swapped his sperm with her would-have-been biological father’s sample at an IVF clinic in Utah have gone public for the first time since their horrific discovery. And the shock is almost too much to bear for the young woman, Annie Branum, who now has to come to terms with the most existential question of all time – 'who am I?' ‘I thought I was this person, you know, [a combination of] my mum and my dad. But now my dad is not my biological father,’ said Annie on Friday. ‘Who am I? Who am I?’ Scroll down for video . Who am I?: Annie Branum, 21, who was fathered by a convicted kidnapper who swapped his sperm with her father's sample at an IVF clinic in Utah, is trying to come to terms with who she really is . Thomas R. Lippert, who is now dead, served two years in prison for kidnapping a student from Purdue University, Indiana in 1975 and performing 'love experiments' on her including electroshock therapy, threatening her family and locking her up in a black box over a three-week period. Lippert went on to work at the Reproductive Medical Technologies clinic in Salt Lake City, Utah from 1988 to 1993. The Branum's lived in Park City from 1990 to 92 and had trouble conceiving. The mother, Pam Branum, told KUTV on Friday that she and her husband went to the fertility clinic in 1992. The clinic had partnered with the University of Utah. The procedure was a success and nine months later Annie was born. The family could never fathom that their daughter was in fact fathered by a technician at the clinic. Thomas R. Lippert served two years in prison for kidnapping a student from Purdue University, Indiana in 1975 and performing 'love experiments' on her including electo-shock therapy . Lippert’s deception was finally revealed in a twist of fate after the Branums sent cheek swabs off for online genetic testing. The . results were shocking as Mrs Branum discovered that her 21-year-old was . not related to her husband, John, but instead was Lippert's child. ‘I thought, ""Oh my God "",’ she told KUTV. Mrs . Branum had tracked down a cousin of Lippert's who revealed the man's . past. A genetic test with Lippert's 99-year-old mother revealed that . Annie was his daughter. ‘In the beginning I was shocked,’ says Annie. She . says her mother told her that ‘it doesn’t match anything, there is no . DNA that you share with your father. It took me a minute… I was like, . ""what do you mean? ""’ 'Oh my God': Annie and her mother, Pam Branum, left, say they were shocked by the findings that reveal a convict had fathered Annie in 1982 . Demands answers: Mrs Branum says she wants to know if her husband's sperm sample fathered a different child . Investigation: Mrs Branum tracked down a cousin of Lippert's who revealed the man's past. A genetic test with Lippert's 99-year-old mother revealed that Annie was his daughter . According . to reports, Lippert would keep a wall of portraits of children born . through the clinic at his desk and seemed 'proud' of them, sparking . fears he may have secretly fathered other children. Mrs . Branum said: 'All those photos of the babies that he was so proud of I . thought, ''Oh my God, how many of those are his biological children?''' Information as to just what happened at the sperm bank is sketchy as Lippert died in 1999 and the clinic closed in 1998. But the Branums have unanswered questions that they want to be settled. ‘My . husband wants to know where his sample is. Is there a child out there . we don’t know about? I don’t think we are the only ones. I think we are . one of many,’ Mrs Branum told KUTV. Appeals are being made for anyone who received a sperm donation at this time and may have doubts to come forward. CeCe Moore, a genetic genealogist, has set up a site Was Your Child Fathered by Thomas Lippert? as she is concerned that there may be more children fathered by Lippert in the Salt Lake City area. Other biological children? Pam and Annie wonder how many more children are out there . Lippert's widow, who did not have any children with the kidnapper said she was not surprised by the revelations, telling KUTV: 'I think, because Tom didn’t have any kids, he wanted to have a lot of kids out there.' Mrs Lippert said that she tried to leave her husband but that he had threatened to kill her. Lippert . was found guilty of the abduction of fine-arts student Susan Wells . Cochran, 21, when he was a 25-year-old law professor at Southwest State . College in Marshall, Minnesota. The . professor, who was a friend of Miss Cochran, tried to 'brainwash her . into falling in love with him' with the help of a student assistant . Harold Ross Tenneson, 21. Deception: Lippert worked at Reproductive Medical . Technologies clinic in Salt Lake City, Utah from 1988 to 1993 where it . is believed he swapped sperm samples with his own. Pictured right: Lippert as a young law professor during which time he kidnapped a student, Susan Wells Cochran . The . kidnappers drove Miss Cochran through several states after abducting . her when she posted an ad for a ride to Boston to visit her boyfriend. Miss Cochran told People: 'We got 30 miles out of town. And, well, that was it.' She . was forced to strip and endure electroshock therapy confined in a . 'black box'. She was also forced to sleep in the same bed as Lippert but . was not raped by him. The student was found three weeks later at the Southwest State Library by FBI after a lengthy search for the missing woman. Lippert . accepted a plea bargain for the government and served two years in jail . along with undergoing psychiatric treatment for 90 days. Criminal: Lippert, pictured in 1998, was found guilty of the abduction of fine-arts student Susan Wells Cochran, 21, in 1975 . 'I . understand that this happened to me, and there is nothing I can do to . change it. So, why should I live my life any differently knowing this . has happened?' Annie . studies astrophysics at the University of San Antonio and plays several . instruments. According to KUTV, Lippert was also very musical, so the . family believe their daughter got his best genetic qualities. ‘We . have really strong faith and we believe that God is going to work . everything for good,’ says Mrs Branum. ‘And he has because we have her.’ he University of Utah is responding to the story and offered 2News the following statement; here it is in its entirety: . According to a statement from the University of Utah, they have been investigating the incident since April 2013. Accepted it: Annie says she understands what has happened and that she cannot change the fact that she is Lippert's biological daughter . 'The University of Utah has been investigating credible information regarding the possible mislabeling or tampering of a semen sample at RMTI (Reproductive Medical Technologies, Inc.), a private andrology lab owned by a University faculty member (now deceased). 'The facility was a private laboratory located in Midvale, Utah. While not owned or operated by the University, the University contracted with RMTI for specimen preparation and semen analysis. Additionally, RMTI prepared semen samples for private physician offices throughout the community, not University physicians,' according to the statement published by KUTV. 'Through genetic testing, a woman who received artificial insemination (AI) in 1991 discovered the biological father of her child was not her husband, as she had assumed. She traced the genetics of her child to a man who was a former employee of the now-defunct RMTI, which may have prepared the AI sample. The man in question was also a part-time employee of the University from 1988-94. The .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . When Nigella Lawson had her belongings moved from the marital home she shared with multi-millionaire art collector Charles Saatchi into the London flat she's staying at following their very public altercation, she probably hadn't thought her Cannabis habit would be exposed. Luckily, for the domestic goddess, it was a perfectly legal Cannabis energy drink (£4.99, firebox.com) and not the real deal. The can was pictured wedged into the bottom of a Perspex box along with her other most essential belongings, such as a blender and cookery books. Nigella Lawson would appear to be a fan of Cannabis energy drinks, the high-caffeine legal tipple, packed with taurine, hemp seed extract, B vitamins and sugar, which were pictured inside one of her removal boxes . The drink, branded with a marijuana leaf and billed as ‘Amsterdam's coolest energy drink', may be guilty of crass marketing, but its ingredients are innocent. It contains hemp seed extract, caffeine, taurine (an amino acid which helps regulate the blood), B vitamins and a substantial 11 g of sugar, so it'll give you a sugar high but not a narcotic one. The drug cannabis is also an extract from the hemp family, but is made from a different variety of plant. Hemp has been used for years in products such as eco-clothing and natural carpeting. But now the oil is the biggest buzzword, as the manufacturers' boast that it is a good source of protein and essential fatty acids has led to sales of the drink soaring. It has been available in the UK only for 18 months, but a 50 per cent rise in sales is predicted this year. The drinks were spotted inside boxes lifted into a removal van outside the London home Nigella Lawson shared with Charles Saatchi . Hemp's natural nuttiness also lends itself to tea. German eco-brand Hanf Natur is behind a range of smoky teas made from dried hemp. One is mixed with raspberry leaves, rosehip and hibiscus to ‘soothe and calm your senses' (£4.35 from sativabags.com). And farmers in the Swiss Alps cultivate hemp to mix with green tea for an iced drink (£1.45, thehempshop.co.uk). Need perking up? Try hemp coffee (£8.90, hempiness.co.uk). While the marketing for Nigella's Cannabis can and other drinks may be tasteless, their contents are anything but.","Drink is legal Cannabis drink (£4.99, Firebox)
