"(CNN) -- Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States, received an experimental medicine nearly a week after being admitted into the hospital -- a far longer wait than experienced by four other Ebola patients treated in the United States. Those patients -- two each at Atlanta's Emory University Hospital and the University of Nebraska Medical Center -- received their experimental medicines immediately. Those four are U.S. citizens; Duncan is a Liberian national. Duncan died Wednesday at the Texas hospital where he was being treated, 10 days after he was admitted. ""We feel he didn't get the medicine and treatment for the disease because he's African and they don't consider him as important as the other three,"" Josephus Weeks, Duncan's nephew, said at a press conference Tuesday afternoon, a day before Duncan died. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who attended that press conference with Weeks and Duncan's mother as a newly appointed spokesman for the family, said, ""We don't feel good about that. It's been a concern he had to wait so long."" Jackson said he thinks money also played a role in Duncan's treatment. ""I would tend to think that those who do not have insurance, those who do not have Medicaid do not have the same priorities as those who do,"" the civil rights leader said. In a statement, a spokeswoman for Dallas' Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital said Duncan was ""treated the way any other patient would have been treated, regardless of nationality or ability to pay for care. We have a long history of treating a multicultural community in this area."" The hospitals that took care of the four other patients had substantial advance notice that patients were on their way. Duncan went the emergency room at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on September 25, but staff there didn't realize he had Ebola and sent him home hours later. He was admitted on September 28 when the hospital realized he had the disease. He started receiving the experimental drug, brincidofovir, on October 4. ""Mr. Duncan succumbed to an insidious disease, Ebola,"" hospital spokesman Wendell Watson said in a statement. ""He fought courageously in this battle. Our professionals, the doctors and nurses in the unit, as well as the entire Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas community, are also grieving his passing."" Thomas Eric Duncan: First Ebola death in U.S. Since the drugs being used to treat Ebola are still experimental, it is up to each individual hospital to file the paperwork with the Food and Drug Administration for permission to get the drug from the manufacturer and use it. The agency received the request to use brincidofovir on October 3, five days after Duncan entered the hospital, Stephanie Yao, a spokeswoman for the FDA, said Wednesday. ""The care team has been consulting with the CDC and Emory, on a daily basis since Mr. Duncan was admitted to the hospital, discussing the possible course of treatment, including the use of investigational drugs,"" Watson, the hospital spokesman, said in a statement. The FDA and Chimerix, the company that makes the drug, said if there was any delay it wasn't on their part. Yao said she couldn't comment on any particular case, but when doctors make requests for experimental Ebola treatments, ""we turn them around in a matter of a few hours -- often less than one hour."" Ebola drugs are in the works . Joseph Schepers, a spokesman for Chimerix, said requests to use brincidofovir ""are expedited immediately in the most expedited way you could possibly do it."" ""It's a general rule in medicine that the earlier you start therapy in a sick person who needs the therapy, the better the response,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, when asked about the impact of the wait for the drug. Weeks said he and his family had to ""pressure"" the hospital to apply for permission to give the drug, brincidofovir, to Duncan. ""They were treating him with oxygen, water and a bed to lay on,"" he said. Weeks and Jackson said they believe the hospital applied for permission to use brincidofovir only after Jackson gave out the hospital's phone number on his radio show last week and urged listeners to call in and complain. Ashoka Mukpo, a freelance NBC cameraman, was admitted to the University of Nebraska Medical Center Tuesday and began receiving brincidofovir the same day. Dr. Rick Sacra received another experimental drug called TKM-Ebola, which is easier to access but still requires permission from the FDA. Dr. Kent Brantley and Nancy Writebol -- both treated at Emory -- took Zmapp, which is no longer available because the company ran out of supplies of the drug.

"(CNN) -- The mystery surrounding North Korea's erratic young leader, Kim Jong Un, only deepens by the day. He has not been seen publicly in more than a month.  Rumors are flying that Kim is ill with gout, diabetes, even possible problems with his ankles. Now, a group of defectors say they believe Kim's younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, may be running the country while he recuperates. The North Korea Intellectuals' Solidarity, a think-tank run by defectors, says Kim Yo Jong may be at least temporarily leading the government. The group has not revealed the source of its information, and CNN cannot independently confirm it. But Kim Yo Jong's star appears to be rising. Why has North Korea decided to talk now? Michael Madden, who runs the blog North Korea Leadership Watch, says Kim Yo Jong has been identified in North Korean media as deputy director of the Workers' Party, a very powerful position. Victor Cha, an analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies who previously handled the North Korea account with the National Security Council, says Kim Yo Jong began surfacing publicly earlier this year at party functions. ""Clearly it's an effort to slow-track her into becoming somebody who is important within the system,"" Cha says. ""I can see how it's possible that she's in some sort of temporary position. It's very difficult for the North Korean system to run without one of the Kim family at least titularly in charge. So, if Kim Jong Un is indisposed, she's really the only available body that's left, in terms of a direct Kim family line."" Is Kim Jong Un still in charge of North Korea? Who is Kim Yo Jong? Madden says Kim Yo Jong was born in 1987 or 1988, and attended private school in Switzerland with Kim Jong Un. They both stayed at the North Korean embassy while attending the Swiss school, Madden says, and lived there under assumed names. Madden says Kim Yo Jong is the youngest of seven siblings their father, Kim Jong Il, had with four women. Many of them are half-siblings, but Kim Jong Un and Kim Yo Jong have the same mother. Opinion: Why Kim is probably still in charge . Madden says Kim Yo Jong was always close to her father, and after returning from Switzerland, she was appointed to positions of responsibility in the government. She would act as an advance-team leader, inspecting sites before official visits, and had administrative duties as well. Now, he says, she continues those duties and has taken on more responsibility under her brother's rule: dealing with policy and receiving intelligence briefings. She acts ""almost like a White House chief-of-staff would,"" Madden says. He says he believes she had a large role in planning the recent trip by three top North Korean officials to South Korea while her brother was absent from the scene. Opinion: Why Kim is probably still in charge . Ready for prime time? Given her age and that so little is known about Kim Yo Jong, North Korea-watchers are concerned about her being in the top leadership spot, if only temporarily. The stress and palace intrigue inside the North Korean regime, they say, may be overwhelming. ""If in fact she is running the country -- as someone in their early to mid twenties, to me that is quite alarming,"" Cha says. ""It means there is something seriously wrong with Kim Jong Un and there is some sort of void that they're desperately trying to fill."" All eyes will be on a significant event this Friday, October 10. That's the 69th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers' Party. Kim Jong Un attended the anniversary event last year. If he doesn't show up at Friday's ceremonies, concern over his public disappearance will only grow. If he does attend, intelligence analysts will be looking at his appearance, his body language -- every detail -- very carefully. Inside North Korea: Water park, sacred birth site and some minders .

"(CNN) -- Is it ever acceptable to stand by and let people drown? European leaders seem to think so; in fact it's their new policy. This week Mare Nostrum, the search and rescue operation in the Mediterranean Sea deployed to help those who get into difficulty while trying to reach the safety of Europe, is due to end. Since it began last year, the Italian naval operation has rescued 150,000 people from death at sea. Tragically, it has also pulled 3,343 bodies from the waves. The Italians have now decided that Mare Nostrum is too costly to bear alone and have asked the rest of Europe for help. But the other European governments have declined, finding it politically expedient to turn their backs on the mothers, fathers and children drowning in the Mediterranean. After all, they're someone else's family; some other country's problem. Mare Nostrum will be replaced by Operation Triton, run by EU border agency Frontex, from November 1. Frontex has said the exclusive focus of Triton will be on border control. There will be no search and rescue function. The justification is a classic example of self-serving doublespeak, disingenuously expressed by the UK Foreign Office Minister Baroness Anelay earlier this month when she told Britain's parliament: ""We do not support planned search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean. ""We believe that they create an unintended 'pull factor', encouraging more migrants to attempt the dangerous sea crossing and thereby leading to more tragic and unnecessary deaths."" The British Government's contention that search and rescue operations are a pull factor is an affront to basic humanity: The suggestion is that if we allow people to drown at sea, it will deter others from setting sail. This is macabre logic. Do liver transplants encourage people to drink more alcohol? Do seatbelts encourage dangerous driving? The argument is as flawed as it is chilling. The current increase in boat journeys across the Mediterranean began after Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown in Libya, and reached a peak last summer, when Mare Nostrum was established as a response. People weren't embarking then because they expected to be rescued, and it's not why they're embarking now. Our leaders act as if oblivious to the fact that the world is in the grip of the greatest refugee crisis since World War II. Over 50 million people around the world have been forcibly displaced, with the Syrian conflict alone spawning more than 3 million refugees. Those fleeing atrocities will not stop seeking safety in Europe if we stop throwing them life rings. Putting your life in the hands of unscrupulous people smugglers and boarding a rickety, overcrowded boat in Libya will remain a rational decision if your country is in flames and you're scared for your life. The perversity of the European Union's inhumane stance is further exposed by the fact that many of those who set sail from North Africa are granted refugee status in EU if they arrive safely, as the majority are Syrians, Eritreans or Somalis. We know these people are likely to need our protection, so why do we make them undertake a deadly journey before we provide it? The answer is not higher walls around Fortress Europe -- it is to provide more safe and legal channels for people to access protection. People are forced to risk their lives in order to reach safety because they have no other choice. We must provide them with alternatives, and there are plenty of options. We could loosen restrictions on family reunification, establish temporary humanitarian admission programs and offer protected entry visas. Or we could heed the UNHCR's call for European countries to accept more refugees for resettlement. The majority of the world's refugees who flee persecution and conflict are unable to travel far beyond the borders of their home country. Developing countries host 86% of the world's refugees, with thousands forced to live in refugee camps for years. A resettlement place is a lifeline. It offers the chance of sleeping in a real bed; of ensuring children have a decent education; of accessing running water; of hope. UNHCR estimates that, today, 691,000 refugees around the world are in urgent need of resettlement. These people will never be able to go home, and are unable to rebuild their lives in the poor countries to which they have fled. Currently, the number of resettlement places offered by EU countries is pitiful: emergency programs aside, only 5,500 resettlement places are available annually. The UK's contribution is a meager 750. EU leaders must not close their eyes or turn their backs to this refugee crisis. More can and should be done to help. Pulling up the drawbridge to Fortress Europe will only consign more desperate, scared people to death by drowning, with their bodies washing up on the beaches of Southern Europe.

"Mumbai, India (CNN) -- I normally don't dwell on what I am going to wear before I go on a shoot. It's usually something presentable, comfortable and preferably in a bright ""TV"" color that makes my cameraman Rajesh happy. This time, though, I was perplexed. I was about to film a story on manual scavenging. We were going to film people who clean human excreta. Knowing I would have to get close to human waste while filming, I opted for a pair of old water-resistant hiking boots. I told Rajesh to wear old shoes too. My feet were prepared for what lay ahead. I was not. I did not expect to see people cleaning human waste from the roads right in the heart of Mumbai, a booming financial capital and the face of modern India. 'Night soil' It's called manual scavenging -- the removal of human waste or ""night soil"" from sites where there is no flush system. Though the Indian parliament passed The Employment of Manual Scavengers and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act, in 1993 and reinforced the ban in 2013, private contractors hired by the municipal government continue to employ them. Ganesh Shinde, 42, has been doing this job since 2007. ""Of course I don't like it,"" he tells me. ""But I have to feed my family."" Shinde's day begins around 6.30 a.m., seven days a week. He's a contractor who works for the city of Mumbai, earning just $5 a day. Usually, he walks to work. Shinde carries a broom, while his colleague carries a tin plate. Shinde sweeps, his partner scoops. According to various studies, nearly 50% of India's population doesn't have access to toilets -- which leaves them with no choice but to go outdoors. The situation is acute in villages. And as I found out, in cities too. I saw child after child carrying a mug of water come to the road where we waited with Shinde. They pulled their pants down and squatted on the edge of the kerb. They did their business and walked away, leaving Shinde and his colleague with the grim task of cleaning up after them. ""Now I am used to it,"" Shinde says, admitting he found it hard when he first started the job. Dehumanizing and dangerous . Another manual scavenger, Sunil Chavan, who works in a different part of Mumbai says he would throw up every day when he started working. ""If I take you to the same area I guarantee you will throw up too,"" he says. It's an incredibly dehumanizing and dangerous occupation. Most manual scavengers don't have appropriate equipment. Shinde has no gloves. No boots. He wears a flimsy jacket and thin cloth mask that he made himself. A pair of old sandals leave his feet covered in muck. Those who clean gutters use bamboo sticks to clear jams, while standing in the middle of waste matter that can come as high as their chest. In some instances they must crawl through sewage. They hardly wear any protective gear. Sometimes they don't even wear a shirt. Often, scavengers have to enter manholes too to clear blockages and it's not uncommon for them to drink a quick swig of alcohol before starting their job. ""They have to numb their senses,"" Shinde explains. ""How else can anyone bear the stench?"" I know what he means. Standing next to Shinde while he worked was hard enough -- the smell was repulsive and overwhelming. Life expectancy amongst manual scavengers is low. Many develop asthma, skin infections and tuberculosis on the job. Hundreds reportedly die from the work each year. According to the Mumbai based research organization Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), 80% of the manual scavengers die before they turn 60 because of health problems. TISS says in Mumbai alone, an average of 20 sewer workers die each month from accidents, suffocation or exposure to toxic gases. Caste systems persists . Most manual scavengers are Dalits -- people belonging to the lowest strata of India's caste system. They were once considered ""untouchable"" and were forced to live outside the village boundary. Though India's Constitution bans caste-based discrimination, Dalits are still marginalized, despite government efforts to end it. ""They are the most vulnerable section of our society,"" explains Milind Ranade, a labor activist fighting for the rights of manual scavengers. Though Dalits are not shunned the way they used to be, they are still discriminated against because of the work they do. Shinde says it's hard to get a cup of tea. He's often turned away from restaurants. A few small tea vendors will serve him a cup of tea provided he stands on the road and does not enter their premises. If he rides a bus, people turn away when he climbs aboard. ""It's just easier if I walk home,"" Shinde says. At home, we meet his family. They have a young daughter who was at school. I asked Shinde what hopes he has for his child. His wife jumps in to answer, her eyes brimming with tears. ""Not this work,"" she tells me, ""no way. ""She's going to finish school and she's going to stand on her own two feet."" Shinde nods quietly. ""I had no choice,"" he tells me. ""Perhaps it was my destiny."" India's current prime minister, Narendra Modi, hopes to change the future not just for Shinde's daughter but for millions of Indians who are forced to live with unsanitary and unhygienic conditions every day. On October 2, he's launching a Clean India mission -- a nationwide movement that aims to solve India's sanitation problems in five years. He's the first prime minister to make cleanliness a national priority. Lets hope he delivers on this promise.","Ganesh Shinde, 42, has been clearing human waste in Mumbai since 2007 .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- One of Iran's most powerful clerics, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, called Friday for the release of people arrested after last month's disputed presidential election. Rafsanjani remains an influential figure in Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's circle. ""There is no need to have these numbers of people in prison,"" the former Iranian president said during his highly anticipated Friday sermon. ""Let them come back to their families. Let the enemy not laugh at us and criticize us. We must sympathize with those who have suffered damages."" He warned: ""The system cannot lose them. If the system reproaches them they will come back to us."" Tens of thousands of people gathered in and around Tehran University as Rafsanjani spoke for about an hour, according to witnesses at the speech. Iranian police used tear gas to disperse some of the crowds. Many in the crowd chanted: ""Iranians are dying and the nation will not tolerate it."" Traditionally, the speaker before the sermon asks those gathered to yell ""Death to America"" and ""Death to Israel."" But on Friday, after being asked to curse those two countries, the crowd instead chanted, ""Allaho Akbar,"" meaning ""God is great"" -- the signature chant of the opposition movement. It was a key moment of defiance, as thousands in the crowd signaled that they were there to protest, not to support the regime. Later, as Rafsanjani was speaking, he mentioned China and Russia -- two nations that have said they recognize Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as the winner of the election. Some in the crowd began chanting, ""Death to Russia"" and ""Death to China."" Rafsanjani called on the people to stop, saying they should not call for death to anyone. Rafsanjani backs reformist Mir Hossein Moussavi, the opposition candidate who challenged Ahmadinejad in the June 12 election. Protesters say the election results were a sham, but the government stands by them.  Watch more about Rafsanjani's sermon » . Moussavi was at the sermon Friday. The semi-official Islamic Student News Agency posted a photo of him in attendance. A Facebook page associated with Moussavi also said he was at the sermon. The news agency's photos also showed the two other opposition candidates from the election, Mehdi Karrubi and Mohsen Rezaie, at the sermon. There were reports, from people claiming to be witnesses, that Karrubi was attacked by members of the Basij, the paramilitary forces. CNN could not independently verify the reports because of the Iranian government's restrictions on international journalists. After weeks of silence, Rafsanjani recently became increasingly vocal in opposing the brutal crackdown on demonstrators who protested election results. Earlier this month, the Iranian Labor News Agency quoted him as saying: ""People from across the county participated in the elections with excitement. But unfortunately, the events that occurred after that, and the difficulties created for some, left a bitter taste, and I don't think any wakened consciousness would be satisfied with the resulting situation."" Rafsanjani was under pressure Friday to deliver public support for the Iranian establishment. Lawmaker Mohammad Karim Shahrzad was recently quoted by the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency as saying: ""After a monthlong silence, the position of Hashemi Rafsanjani will be very important for those of all political inclinations, particularly those who are aiming at the (destruction) of the unity of the system."" Shahrzad called on Rafsanjani -- head of the Assembly of Experts, the council responsible for appointing or removing the supreme leader -- to ""announce the support of the supreme leadership as the highest authority"" in his speech. A member of parliament said Rafsanjani's sermon would be ""historic."" Moussavi's supporters took to the streets last month to protest the outcome of last month's election that gave Ahmadinejad an overwhelming victory. Rafsanjani's daughter, Faezeh, and four of his other relatives were detained briefly after taking part in one of those rallies. The widespread street protests and civil unrest led to the deaths of at least 20 demonstrators and the arrests of more than 1,000, according to Iran's state-run media. The numbers of casualties and arrests could not be independently verified by CNN because of restrictions on international journalists by the Iranian government. Rafsanjani remains an influential figure in Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's circle, but he has made ""a real break with the supreme leader in this case,"" Iranian-American author Hooman Majd told CNN recently. Rafsanjani was missing when Iran's power brokers assembled on June 19 at Friday prayers to hear Khamenei declare Ahmadinejad the winner. Ahmadinejad is scheduled to be sworn in before parliament between August 2 and August 6, according to Islamic Republic News Agency .","Rafsanjani calls for release of those held after June 12 vote .

"(CNN) -- Fears over Ebola have made the jump from pundits to the playground. On Friday, a group of students attacked two of their peers at I.S. 318 in the Bronx while yelling ""Ebola"" at the brothers who had recently returned from Senegal, the boys' father told CNN Newsroom Tuesday. The New York Department of Education confirms the incident occurred, saying the boys were pushed and shoved. Ousmane Drame, the boys' father, said the boys felt so upset by their experience that they want to go back to Africa. Ebola outbreak: Get up to speed . ""They were made fun of by the children (who) started yelling, 'Ebola. Ebola. Ebola. Africa. Africa,"" Drame said his sons told him. Charles Cooper of the African Advisory Council, a local advocacy group, said that during lunch, one of the boys was jumped by the students who had been calling him ""Ebola."" When his older brother intervened, the brother also was assaulted. Drame said classmates refused to play with his sons in gym. ""We're done playing with you. You have Ebola,"" he said one of the bullies told his sons. ""You sit down. ... They don't want to play with them. Nobody is close to them."" ""We will not tolerate intimidation or bullying of our students,"" NYC Schools Chancellor Carmen Farina said in a statement, ""especially in this moment when New Yorkers need to come together."" Who shouts 'Ebola'? 'The stigmatization of Ebola' Farina added that her office is investigating and that they've sent staff to ""mediate the incident."" Cooper said these young children are bearing ""the stigmatization of Ebola and something needs to be done."" The boys, according to the their father, were born in the United States. Senegal, the country they returned from, has had only one case of Ebola. On October 17, the World Health Organization declared that nation free of Ebola. ""They want to go to school,"" their father said. ""I need to find a new school."" But perception isn't always fueled by fact. In the first week of October, the CDC received 800 calls from Americans concerned about Ebola. When a doctor in Manhattan became that New York City's first Ebola patient, everything he'd touched since he returned from Guinea came under scrutiny. A bowling alley he visited underwent decontamination as headlines asked whether Ebola could be transmitted via a bowling ball. Poll on Ebola attitudes . According to a new CNN poll, 81% of Americans polled think it's likely someone in the United States will be infected with Ebola in the next few weeks. But only about a quarter think that will happen in their community. A slight majority approve of the federal government's handling of the disease and fully 71% are confident the feds can prevent a nationwide outbreak. But the poll did show that three in 10 would like noncitizens traveling from West Africa to be prevented from entering, even in absence of any symptoms. ""We cannot allow the Ebola epidemic to stigmatize a single population,"" said U.S. Rep Jose Serrano of New York. The congressman, who represents the part of the Bronx where the two boys were attacked, said in a statement: ""Ebola is not a West African problem, or even an African problem, it is a global health concern. Instead of feeding into the fear and discriminating against others, we need to come together in solidarity as we grapple with this terrible disease."" Or as Cooper with African Advisory Council put it to News 12: ""We don't want to see any of our children being bullied in any school. They are there to learn and they're there to be kids."" CNN's Sho Wills contributed to this report.","Two boys just returned from Senegal were beaten at a Bronx public school, their father says .

"(CNN) -- The woman who was once the oldest cheerleader in the NFL faces rape charges for alleged sexual encounters with a teenager at a Delaware vacation home. Former Baltimore Ravens cheerleader Molly Shattuck, 47, turned herself in to authorities on Wednesday and was arraigned on charges of third-degree rape, unlawful sexual contact and providing alcohol to minors, police said. Shattuck's alleged relationship with the 15-year-old boy ""began in the area in which they resided near Baltimore, Maryland, and culminated with Shattuck providing alcohol to minors and engaging in a sexual relationship with the 15-year-old male at a vacation rental home in Bethany Beach, Delaware, over Labor Day weekend,"" Delaware State Police said. She has pleaded not guilty and posted $84,000 bail, CNN affiliate WBAL reported. ""This is a difficult situation for everyone involved. Thank you for your time,"" defense attorney Michelle Lipkowitz said, according to WBAL. Shattuck became the oldest cheerleader in the NFL when she joined the Ravens' squad in 2005 at age 38. In 1997, she married Mayo Shattuck III, the former CEO of Constellation Energy. The two are separated and going through a divorce, according to WBAL. A 2008 profile of Shattuck on the Ravens' website described her as a ""well-known civic leader in Baltimore."" That year, she appeared on the FOX reality show ""Secret Millionaire,"" living for a week on low wages in a coal-mining town in eastern Pennsylvania, according to the profile. Shattuck was nominated for a service award from Maryland's governor's office this year for her work. She also published a book, ""Vibrant Living,"" detailing her 21-day ""back-to-basics approach to better health and better habits.""

"(CNN) -- Dr. Luke's lawyer is going public with details of what the music producer alleges is Kesha's attempt to extort him to get out of her recording contract. The attorney provided CNN with a segment from an email she contends shows Kesha's mom threatened to make sex accusations public unless her daughter was released from her contract. Kesha accuses Dr. Luke of sexually, physically and verbally abusing her over the past decade in a lawsuit filed Tuesday that demands she be freed from the contract she signed with him when she was 18. The harsh accusations in her complaint describe an alleged rape involving Dr. Luke allegedly drugging the singer after a party. The lawsuit says he used constant verbal insults -- such as calling her ""a fat f--king refrigerator"" -- ""to make her feel completely worthless and maintain complete control over her life."" Continuous criticism about her weight by Dr. Luke caused Kesha, 27, to developed the eating disorder bulimia nervosa, which almost killed her, according to her complaint. To continue under his control is a threat to her life, it contends. Dr. Luke filed his own lawsuit against Kesha hours after hers was made public Tuesday, accusing the singer of extorting him to gain freedom from her recording contract. His lawyer, Christine Lepera, followed up Thursday with a statement to CNN that said Kesha's lawsuit is ""a spectacular and outrageous fiction that will go down in flames."" ""As the truth emerges, this sad and misguided smear campaign will only hurt Kesha,"" Lepera said. That truth, Lepera said, is that Kesha lawyer Mark Gerago's ""real goal is to get out of her contract, rather than vindicate these absurd and defamatory allegations."" Dr. Luke ""hasn't seen Kesha in years,"" Lepera said. ""This kind of cynical grandstanding in which false claims of abuse are used as a negotiating tactic insults real victims."" Lepera provided to CNN what she said was part of an email that Kesha's mother sent to Dr. Luke's lawyer a year ago threatening to smear the producer's reputation unless her daughter was freed from her contract: . ""Tomorrow I am going to start making public how Dr. Luke blackmailed me into giving him and Circuit publishing credit, on all songs I wrote on warrior, with Kesha and other writers and producers... We, me and kesha and her friends... are going to make all of this Really PUBLIC, in the next few days. Luke date raped Kesha when she was 18. Nicky Hilton's birthday? Paris Hiltons house? Luke gave Kesha pills? She ended up naked in his hotel room 2 days later, no longer a virgin? Do we want all this to come out? either this Luke releases Kesha from all legal contracts, and gives me back all my publishing, or we, Kesha and I. tell the truth."" Geragos responded to Lepera's extortion charge in his own statement to CNN Thursday: . ""It is telling that Dr. Luke would twist an email from a horrified and justifiably angry mother threatening to tell the truth -- the truth! -- about the predator that sexually assaulted her daughter. It is offensive -- but not surprising -- that Dr. Luke would try and pervert the words of a concerned mother to try and keep Kesha under his unilateral control against her will."" Kesha, whose full name is Kesha Rose Sebert, was ""an intelligent, family-oriented and joyful young woman"" before Dr. Luke ""showered her with promises of fame and fortune"" and induced her to sign a contract with him in 2005, her lawsuit said. Instead of living a life of Hollywood glamor, she ""lived in a prison of his abuse,"" the lawsuit said. Her complaint accuses him of giving her a ""date rape drug"" that allowed him to sexually assault her while she was unconscious. The abuse didn't end after her debut album sold more than a million copies in the United States in 2010, her complaint said. ""For the past 10 years, Dr. Luke has sexually, physically, verbally and emotionally abused"" her ""to the point where Ms. Sebert nearly lost her life,"" it said. She entered a rehabilitation center to be treated for the eating disorder earlier this year, the lawsuit said.

"(CNN) -- Overshadowed by its bigger, flashier neighbors, Paraguay is a curious country that's overlooked by visitors who flock to South American destinations like Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro and the highlands of the Andes. For those who visit nearby nations, though, Paraguay's subtropical forests, broad rivers and unusual history can make it an intriguing detour. Surrounded by Brazil, Argentina and Bolivia, this landlocked nation is larger than a glance at the map suggests. It's roughly the size of California but has only about 6.7 million residents, at least 3 million fewer than Los Angeles County. Taste Paraguay's delicious mistake . The Rio Paraguay divides the country into roughly equal halves. Most of the population lives in the eastern half, about a third of them in the riverside capital city of Asuncion. To the west, the Gran Chaco area is a mostly grassy plain, brutally hot in summer, punctuated with marshes, savannas and thorn forests. Thinly populated with ranchers and Amerindians, the west is also home to German-speaking Mennonite colonies near the Bolivian border. It's tempting to say that Paraguay is unspoiled by tourists, and that would be true; most visitors come from neighboring countries, with whom the nation warred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Now, despite ups and downs in the quarter-century since notorious dictator Alfredo Stroessner fell from power, Paraguay has become a more welcoming place. In the absence of mass tourism, it's a place where closer contact and the lack of preconceptions can lead to memorable, even intimate, experiences at underrated sites. Arrivals from North America or Europe are a relative novelty, to be treated with courtesy and respect. Here are 14 things to know about this little-known country: . ¿Habla usted Guarani? Paraguay is Latin America's most bilingual country, as nearly 90% of all Paraguayans speak both Spanish and indigenous Guarani. It is the only country in the region with a large percentage of nonindigenous citizens who speak an indigenous language. There are at least a dozen other native languages, but none approaches Guarani's prevalence. An evolving capital . Paraguay's sprawling riverside capital, Asuncion, is the hub of its political, commercial and cultural life. Unlike most of South America's capitals, it's a relatively low-rise city where shade is at a premium, except on some lushly landscaped plazas. It was founded in 1537, and its grid pattern is typical of the earliest Spanish settlements, but there are few remaining colonial buildings. The most notable structures, such as the government palace and the shrine to those who perished in battle, date from the 19th century. The government's house . Asuncion's counterpart to the White House is the Palacio de los Lopez, a neoclassical building intended for the dynasty that ruled the country for decades in the mid-19th century. The Lopez family didn't survive the War of the Triple Alliance, when they foolishly took on Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay in a bid to dominate the region. Still, their political successors have occupied the palace ever since. Shrine to warriors . In downtown Asuncion, protected by an honor guard, the Panteon de los Heroes is a domed neoclassical shrine housing the remains of the figures who led their country into disastrous conflict with neighboring countries. Started in the 1860s, before the War of the Triple Alliance, it wasn't finished until 1936, after the Chaco War with Bolivia. A couple of unknown soldiers are a token presence. Picturing diversity . Paraguay has a rich indigenous heritage, not just from its Guarani past and present but also thanks to the smaller but diverse Amerindian populations from the Gran Chaco region that overlaps western Paraguay. Asuncion's Museo Etnografico Andres Barbero has a strong collection of historic photographs but also displays tools, ceramics and weavings from all regions of the country. Avant art . In its isolation, Paraguay may give the impression of provincialism, but Asuncion has a lively contemporary art scene showcased at many galleries and the Museo del Barro, which displays avant-garde works by Paraguayan, Spanish and other Latin American artists under optimum conditions (no easy feat in this hot, humid climate). The museum also features folk art collections from the 17th century to the present and more strictly indigenous artifacts from Paraguay's native peoples. Spiderweb lace . One of Paraguay's iconic crafts is nanduti, the embroidered lace that probably arrived from the Spanish island of Tenerife. The word itself, meaning ""spiderweb"" in the Guarani language, aptly describes the weavers' geometric patterns but not the rainbow of colors that embellish their designs. Sopa Paraguaya . A common traditional dish, ""Paraguayan soup"" isn't quite what its name would suggest. Rather, it's cornbread flavored with cheese and onion, among other ingredients. (Check out Eatocracy's recipe.) Legend says its odd moniker stems from a mistake by 19th-century dictator Carlos Antonio Lopez's cook, who accidentally added excessive corn flour to a more liquid lunchtime dish. Fortunately for the cook, Lopez liked the results. Terere . Related to the common holly, cultivated on plantations throughout the region, mate (pronounced ""mahtay"") or ""Paraguayan tea"" is popular among Argentines, Uruguayans and even southern Brazilians, who imbibe prodigious amounts of their favorite infusion. Some like it hot, but Paraguayans prefer it chilled in the suffocating summer heat. An early Jesuit missionary claimed that mate ""improves the appetite, speedily counteracts the languor arising from the burning climate, and assuages both hunger and thirst."" Villa Hayes . Historically, Latin Americans are skeptical of the United States and its politicians, but Rutherford B. Hayes is a Paraguayan hero. After the 19th-century War of the Triple Alliance against Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, this otherwise obscure U.S. president awarded the Gran Chaco -- now more than half of Paraguay's territory -- to Asuncion instead of Buenos Aires. Both Argentina and Paraguay sent diplomats to Washington for Hayes' binding arbitration. Paraguayan President Candido Bareiro renamed the former town of Villa Occidental, across the river from Asuncion, in Hayes' honor. The surrounding county, a school (with a monument) and the local soccer team also bear his name. (In Hayes' hometown of Delaware, Ohio, a gas station occupies the site of his birthplace). Foundry in the forest . Southeast of Asuncion, recovering subtropical forest blankets the compact and relatively small but verdant Parque Nacional Ybycui. Ybycui offers creekside trails, waterfalls and droves of metallic blue butterflies. Howler monkeys are harder to spot but easier to hear. The park is also a historical site for the iron foundry destroyed by Brazilian forces in the War of the Triple Alliance, a severe blow to Paraguay's war effort. Cinematic ruins . Along the easterly Rio Parana, which forms much of the border with Brazil and Argentina, 17th- and 18th-century Jesuit evangelists and their Guarani converts built a string of missions that provided the background for Roland Joffe's award-winning film ""The Mission."" Best known of the bunch is Argentina's San Ignacio Mini, but Paraguay's Mision Jesus de Tavarangue and Mision la Santisima Trinidad de Parana, near the southern city of Encarnacion, are almost equally well-preserved ruins. Strictly speaking, Mision Jesus is not a ruin; rather, it was an incomplete construction when Spain expelled the Jesuits from the New World in 1767. Smuggler central? Near the ""Triple Border"" with Argentina and Brazil, not far from the famous Iguazu Falls, Ciudad del Este is a chaos of consumerist commerce. For street bazaars that barely leave room for a single pedestrian to pass, Brazilian bargain-hunters flock across the bridge for knockoff Rolexes and the like. One local ""businessman,"" though, observed that the regional Mercosur common market could mean that ""we will no longer be able to live by smuggling products and will have to begin producing things."" Bruderliebe? In the vastness of the Gran Chaco, about 280 miles (450 km) northwest of Asuncion via a paved highway, Filadelfia is the administrative center of Colonia Fernheim, a settlement of pacifist Mennonites who arrived from the Soviet Union in the 1930s. Of the area's several Mennonite colonies, this is the most outgoing, especially if German (preferably Plautdietsch or Low German) is your language of brotherly love.

"Washington (CNN) -- A repeal of President Barack Obama's signature health care law is ""not gonna happen"" even if the GOP takes the Senate, Ohio Gov. John Kasich said. The Republican governor's comments, in an interview with The Associated Press published Monday, are a major departure from the rest of his party -- and stunning for a potential 2016 presidential contender. ""The opposition to it was really either political or ideological,"" Kasich said of Obamacare. ""I don't think that holds water against real flesh and blood, and real improvements in people's lives."" The governor later reversed course on Twitter, saying The Associated Press ""got it wrong"" and that he wants to ""repeal and replace"" Obamacare. A Kasich spokesman said the governor was referring solely to Obamacare's Medicaid expansion -- not the entire law -- and that his comments were reported out of context. Kasich angered conservatives when he bypassed Ohio's Republican-controlled legislature and embraced Obamacare's Medicaid expansion last year. His comments reflect the political balancing act facing GOP governors who criticized the law but have implemented parts or all of it. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence has sought a middle ground, arguing for a version of the Medicaid expansion that includes changes such as individual health savings accounts requiring personal contributions -- a program initially crafted under his predecessor, Mitch Daniels. Others Republican governors seen as prospective presidential candidates, like Wisconsin's Scott Walker and Louisiana's Bobby Jindal, have been outspoken opponents of Obamacare, refusing to implement it and saying they'd like to see it repealed. In states that have expanded Medicaid, Democratic Senate candidates like Alison Lundergan Grimes in Kentucky have pressed their Republican opponents about what would happen to the hundreds of thousands of low-income residents who now have health coverage. ""We have over a half a million Kentuckians who for the first time ever are filling prescriptions, they're going to the doctor, they're getting checkups,"" Grimes said in a recent debate with Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. ""I will not be a senator that rips that insurance from their hands.""","NEW: Governor's spokesman says comments were reported out of context .

"(CNN) -- The gunmen came in during noon prayers at the small Sunni mosque in the Diyala province, waving AK-47 machine guns. Then they opened fire, the sound of the gunfire carried over the mosque's loudspeakers that seconds earlier had been broadcasting prayers. When the bullets stopped flying at the Musab bin Omar Mosque in the village of Bani Weis, about 75 kilometers (46 miles) northeast of Baquba, 34 people were dead and a more than a dozen were wounded. Now, a report released Sunday by Human Rights Watch, citing witnesses and survivors of the August 22 attack, points the finger at Shiite militias and Iraqi security forces. Victims of the massacre ""by Iraqi pro-government militias and security forces recognized the attackers and knew them by name,"" the report said. Some wore Iraqi police uniforms, according to the report. The rights group called on the government to make public details of its findings into the attack, which HRW said was consistent with a pattern of killings being carried out in Iraq by Shiite militias, including al Haq, the Badr Brigades and Kataib Hezbollah. ""Pro-government militias are becoming emboldened and their crimes more shocking,"" said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at HRW. ""Iraqi authorities and Iraq's allies alike have ignored this horrific attack and then they wonder why the militant group Islamic State has had such appeal among Sunni communities."" HRW called on the United States and its allies to stop providing Iraq ""with military support and assistance until the government ensures that such widespread war crimes and crimes against humanity have ended,"" the rights group said. Complicated strategic situation . It's unlikely that will occur as the United States and a host of allies have been providing military support to Iraq in its effort to take back wide swaths of land seized by ISIS, the militant group that refers to itself as the Islamic State. The attack made international headlines after Sunni lawmakers in Iraq withdrew from negotiations to form a new government, saying they would not return until those behind the attack were arrested. Initial reports said 65 people were killed. The figure was later revised to 34. But the U.S. State Department called on the lawmakers to return to negotiations, saying they needed to take steps to unify the country, not divide it further. Iraq's government formed an investigative committee, but according to HRW, the findings have not been made public nor have they been shared with the survivors or the victims' families. According to the report, a spokesman for the Ministry of Interior told HRW that it had formed a commission to investigate the attack, and the commission had determined three suspects carried out the killings. Authorities told HRW the attack on the mosque appeared to be retaliation for a roadside bomb explosion earlier in the day that targeted volunteer Shiite fighters on their way into Bani Weis. Ministry officials did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. 'Don't move. No one leave' The accounts offered by survivors and witnesses to HRW paint a terrifying picture of what unfolded inside the mosque on August 22. ""Don't move. No one leave,"" a gunman wearing a dark green T-shirt and a headband typically worn by militiamen affiliated with Asaib al-Haq, the survivor said. ""He aimed his first shot at the sheikh, and then he continued shooting the rest of us. When I heard the first gunshot, I dropped to the ground,"" the survivor said. The survivor, who was not identified by HRW over safety concerns, was one of the lucky ones. The attack, according to witnesses, was carried out in two stages, with gunmen opening fire inside the mosque and then shooting would-be rescuers outside. ""The witnesses said there was an army checkpoint about 200 meters (656 feet) from the mosque and a police checkpoint about 150 meters from the mosque, but that no security forces responded to the attack even though the shooting was broadcast over the mosque loudspeaker,"" the report said. Witnesses testified the shooting carried over the loudspeaker could be heard at a distance of at least 600 meters (1,969 feet), it said. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report.","Human Rights Watch report finds Shiite militia behind the massacre at a mosque .

"(CNN) -- Suspected cop killer Eric Matthew Frein appears to have left handwritten notes in the Pennsylvania woods in which he chillingly describes his ambush of two state troopers last month, State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Wednesday. ""Friday September 12, got a shot around 11 p.m. and took it. He dropped ... I took a follow up shot on his head, neck area. He was still and quiet after that. Another cop approached the one I just shot. As he went to kneel, I took a shot at him and he jumped in the door. His legs were visible and still,"" the note reads, according to Bivens. CNN first reported on the handwritten notes on Monday. Frein, 31, is suspected in the September 12 ambush that left Cpl. Bryon Dickson dead and Trooper Alex T. Douglass wounded outside the Pennsylvania State Police barracks in Blooming Grove. Bivens said Frein faces two additional counts of possession of a weapon of mass destruction after two booby trapped pipe bombs were discovered in the Pocono Mountains search area last week. Authorities said a search of Frein's bedroom turned up a variety of black and synthetic powders -- material consistent with what was used to make the two pipe bombs. In the search of his bedroom, investigators also found galvanized steel pipes drilled out to accept fusing material, end caps, pyrotechnic fuse and improvised explosive initiators. ""The design is simple but very dangerous and could have caused significant injury to anyone in the vicinity of that explosive,"" said Sam Rabadi, special agent in charge of ATF in Pennsylvania. Who is Eric Frein? Bivens said the handwritten notes were discovered among items left behind at a campsite located by law enforcement agents on September 29. After the shooting, Frein supposedly wrote, ""I ran back to the jeep. I made maybe half a mile ... and hit a road block. I didn't expect one so soon. It was only 15 to 20 minutes."" Bivens quoted the suspect as writing that he ""did a k turn a quarter mile from them and pulled into a development I knew had unfinished access road. Hearing helos, I just used my marker lights, missed the trail around a runoff pool and drove straight into it. Disaster. Made half attempt to stash AK and ran."" A massive search for Frein has been carried out since, at times involving as many as 1,000 officers. Despite recent sightings and other leads, he has eluded authorities. The manhunt has cost several million dollars, Bivens said. Authorities have said that a review of a computer hard drive used by Frein shows that he had planned the attack for years. Frein has been described as a survivalist and military reenactment enthusiast with a hatred for law enforcement, authorities say. CNN's David Shortell and Steve Kastenbaum contributed to this report.","Eric Frein appears to have left notes after allegedly killing cop in Pennsylvania .

"Washington (CNN) -- After being lampooned on social media for delaying the start of a debate because his opponent used a fan, Florida Gov. Rick Scott tried to bring the race back to the real issue at stake: Why did former Gov. Charlie Crist need a fan in the first place? Scott held up the Florida gubernatorial debate on Wednesday for seven minutes after his Democratic rival showed up with an electric fan under his podium. ""I think he was sweating and he needed a fan. I'm surprised he didn't try to ask for dry ice,"" Scott said Thursday to CNN affiliate WPBF. That could have actually been a solution to the standoff, because Scott's protest flamed over Crist's apparent disregard for debate rules that banned electronic devices from the stage. ""I think he was probably worried about his track record,"" Scott said, bringing up his campaign talking point that more than 832,000 people lost their jobs during Crist's four-year term as governor during the Great Recession. Crist, a Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat, stood on stage alone Wednesday night for the first seven minutes. ""Are we really going to debate a fan?"" Crist said Wednesday before his Republican opponent eventually joined him. But Scott flipped the script on Thursday, saying his opponent nearly didn't make it on stage himself.

"(CNN) -- Production of musician Gregg Allman's biopic ""Midnight Rider"" has been halted following the death of a 27-year-old camera assistant who was struck and killed by a freight train near Savannah, Georgia, according to Savannah's film office. Last week's death of Sarah Elizabeth Jones rocked the local film community, with many asking who was to blame. A group of friends set up a Facebook page in tribute to Jones with a simple call to action: ""Sarah Elizabeth Jones, friend and family to so many, made every day awesome. Show your slate love here along with all the good stories of her life."" ""The production of 'Midnight Rider' has been halted in Savannah,"" film office spokesperson William Hammargren told CNN Friday. ""The production company withdrew all their existing permit requests and indicated they would not be requesting more at this time.""

The maximum authorized train speed at the railroad trestle where the accident occurred was 70 mph. Jones and others were filming on train tracks at the time of the accident, according to a police report from the Wayne County Sheriff's Office. Film crew members from various countries have been sharing photo tributes, holding clapboards with messages of remembrance for Jones. There hundreds of images shared on the Facebook group Slates for Sarah, which was created on Monday. As of Friday, more than 50,000 people had liked the page.

"(CNN) -- A health care worker worker who just returned from West Africa is under a mandatory quarantine at a New Jersey hospital. New York, New Jersey and Illinois implement mandatory Ebola quarantine policies as the federal government considers a similar move. The 101st Airborne Division assumes control of the U.S. mission to fight Ebola in Liberia. Here's the latest on the Ebola outbreak: . U.S. DEVELOPMENTS . Health worker quarantined in New Jersey . A health care worker who just returned from West Africa does not have Ebola, according to a preliminary test, New Jersey officials said Saturday. But Kaci Hickox, a nurse who cared for Ebola patients while on assignment with Doctors Without Borders in Sierra Leone, will remain in quarantine at Newark's University Hospital for at least 21 days under a controversial new state policy. Hickox wrote in an editorial for a Dallas newspaper, ""This is not a situation I would wish on anyone."" Quarantined Nurse: New Ebola policy in N.J., N.Y. an 'ordeal' ""Doctors Without Borders is very concerned about the conditions and uncertainty she (Hickox) is facing,"" an official with the organization said Saturday. The hospital issued a statement that said, ""While we understand that the required quarantine is an inconvenience, it is our primary goal to make sure that the patient is as comfortable as possible."" Hickox arrived at Newark Liberty International Airport on Friday and was thought to have a fever during an airport Ebola screening. She was then transported to the hospital. Doctor's fiancee tests negative for Ebola . The fiancee of Craig Spencer, the Doctors Without Borders physician who tested positive for Ebola in New York this week, is healthy with no symptoms of the virus, according to NYC Health Department spokeswoman Jean Weinberg. Morgan Dixon returned to her apartment after undergoing testing at Bellevue Hospital, the same hospital where Spencer is receiving treatment for Ebola. Spencer, 33, tested positive for the virus Thursday after returning from Guinea on October 17 and is the first case of Ebola diagnosed in New York. Three states implement mandatory quarantine policies . On the day medical worker Kaci Hickox arrived back in the United States, the governors of New York and New Jersey abruptly announced a new policy to increase airport screening for Ebola and to require anyone who has direct contact with Ebola patients to remain in quarantine for up to three weeks. NYC official: New Ebola policy 'a real stunner' ""This is not the time to take chances,"" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo -- joined by his New Jersey counterpart, Chris Christie -- told reporters. ""This adjustment in increasing the screening procedures is necessary.... I think public safety and public health have to be balanced and I think this policy does that."" But New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Mary Bassett is concerned that the mandatory quarantine will discourage doctors and nurses from volunteering to take care of Ebola patients in West Africa, her spokeswoman said Saturday. Illinois Governor Pat Quinn also ordered the state Department of Public Health to implement a 21-day home quarantine for ""high-risk individuals who have direct contact with an individual infected with Ebola"" while in West Africa, according to the statement from the governor's office. ""The mandatory quarantine order includes any high-risk medical personnel who have performed medical services to individuals infected with the Ebola virus. The order will be implemented by local health departments across the state."" High-risk individuals were previously subject to a voluntary quarantine. The United States is also considering a mandatory quarantine for all returning health care workers from West Africa, an Obama administration official said. 101st Airborne takes control of Ebola mission in Liberia . The 101st Airborne Division officially took control of the U.S. mission in Liberia to fight the Ebola epidemic. Army Major Gen.

"(CNN) -- When doctors risk their lives and sacrifice their livelihoods to go to West Africa and provide desperately needed treatment to those suffering from Ebola, what should be their reward upon coming home? Three weeks off, some say -- whether they like it or not. The governors of New York and New Jersey instituted just such a policy Friday, announcing that airport screening will be stepped up in their states and that any arriving passengers who'd recently been in the West African nations hit hardest by Ebola could be hospitalized or quarantined for up to 21 days -- sick or not. Measures such as these would affect people who lived in or traveled to countries such as Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, where all but a handful of the more than 10,000 documented Ebola cases and almost 5,000 deaths have occurred. And it would also impact those who brought their medical expertise to West Africa, doing what they could to prevent more people from dying or spreading the disease. So there's a tradeoff: Should the focus of American policy be to do everything to prevent anyone from the most ravaged regions from entering the United States, even if it discourages health care workers from going there? On Saturday, the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention said that it sets the baseline recommended standards, but state and local officials have the prerogative to set tighter policies. ""When it comes to the federal standards set by the CDC, we will consider any measures that we believe have the potential to make the American people safer,"" the CDC said in a statement. Some U.S. lawmakers, such as Rep. Andy Harris, favor a strict three-week quarantine. (That time duration is significant because it takes anywhere from two to 21 days from the time a person is exposed to Ebola to when he or she shows symptoms of it; if more time than that passes without symptoms, a person is considered Ebola-free.) ""In return from being allowed to come back into the country from a place where a deadly disease is endemic, you'd have to enter a quarantine facility and be supervised for 21 days,"" the Maryland Republican told CNN. Some, though, think such a policy would be counterproductive. It might prevent some cases of Ebola in the United States over the short term, they say, but over the long run it could backfire if highly trained American doctors have even more incentive not to head to Africa to help corral the disease. Dr. John Carlson, a pediatric immunologist at Tulane University, is one of them. He has spent four weeks working with Ebola patients at a hospital in Freetown, Sierra Leone, and is scheduled to return to New Orleans on Saturday. Health care workers already sacrifice a lot by volunteering their time to help those who most need it; tacking on more time or not being able to venture out in public or go to work might seem like a punishment, discouraging people like him from doing it again. ""If I lose three weeks on my return and don't get to do the work I'm supposed to do,"" Carlson said, referring to his job at Tulane, ""means this wouldn't be workable for me."" CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden expressed a similar view earlier this month, arguing that stringent travel restrictions might create more problems than they solve. ""It makes it hard to get health workers in, because they can't get out,"" he said. ""If we make it harder to respond to the outbreak in West Africa, it will spread not only in those three countries (in West Africa hit hardest by Ebola) but to other parts of Africa and ultimately increase the risk here"" in the United States. Official: New guidelines coming 'shortly' That said, change may be coming. Some of it may come at the state level, as happened in New York and New Jersey. That policy shift was spurred by the hospitalization of Dr. Craig Spencer, a Doctors Without Borders physician who'd treated Ebola patients in Guinea and arrived at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport on October 17; he eventually was diagnosed with Ebola. Since then, a female health care worker who had recently been in West Africa developed a fever, hours after touching down at northern New Jersey's Newark Liberty Airport with no apparent symptons, New Jersey Health Department spokesman Donna Leusner said. A preliminary test showed that the woman does not have Ebola, New Jersey officials said Saturday. But the unidentified woman will remain in quarantine at a hospital in Newark for at least 21 days. Quarantined woman tests negative for Ebola . The new policy in New York and New Jersey allows the states to determine hospitalization or quarantine for up to 21 days for travelers from the affected countries. A mandatory quarantine is called for those who had ""direct contact with an individual infected with the Ebola virus,"" including medical workers who treated Ebola patients. In addition, people with a travel history to the affected regions but with no direct contact with Ebola patients will be ""actively monitored ... and, if necessary, quarantined."" Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn similarly ordered ""a mandatory 21-day home quarantine for high-risk individuals who have had direct contact with an individual infected with the Ebola virus while in Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea,"" according to a release Friday from his office. Those affected by the order -- which will be implemented by local health departments -- include ""any high-risk medical personnel."" ""This protective measure is too important to be voluntary,"" said Quinn. ""We must take every step necessary to ensure the people of Illinois are protected from potential exposure to the Ebola virus."" Such measures are on top of the federal policy requiring all travelers coming to the United States from Ebola-affected areas to be actively monitored for 21 days, starting Monday. Already, such travelers landing in New York's Kennedy, Dulles International, New Jersey's Newark Liberty International, Chicago's O'Hare International and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International must go through enhanced screening. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Friday that the federal government's policies could change even more. ""That is something that is right now under very active discussion, and you'll be hearing shortly about what the guidelines will be,"" Fauci said, answering a reporter's question about quarantines. Timeline of first Ebola patient in NYC . 'Eliminate not just real risk, but perceived risk' Some experts say there might be some middle ground between the two extremes of physically confining people in one place for 21 days or just letting them do whatever they want (beyond, as is now recommended, taking their temperature daily and monitoring themselves for other symptoms). One possibility is to have those travelers do more than temperature checks. Dr. Irwin Redlener, director of Columbia University's National Center for Disaster Preparedness, says one such measure could be checking daily for decreases in white blood cell counts or platelets -- which could be, but aren't necessarily, a sign of an Ebola infection. And Mike Osterholm, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, thinks there should be stricter controls on what a person who arrives from West Africa does in his or her first three weeks in the United States. For instance, he thinks such a person shouldn't take public transportation or go to crowded places like bowling alleys, both of which officials say Spencer did before he was symptomatic. How the Ebola virus spreads . Public health experts say there's plenty of scientific evidence indicating that there's very little chance that a random person will get Ebola, unless they are in very close contact -- close enough to share bodily fluids -- with someone who has it. Still, there's also a sense that authorities have to do something because of Americans' fears -- rational or not -- and belief that the country is better off being safe than sorry. As Osterholm says, ""You want to try to eliminate not just real risk, but perceived risk."" Complete coverage on Ebola .

"(CNN) -- For incoming Prime Minister Narendra Modi, securing India's energy needs over the next decade ranks among his greatest challenges and one that will likely see him both compete and cooperate with China, the United States and Russia. These three are the world's biggest energy consumers, with India in fourth spot. For all of them, energy security is a constant goal, driving their search for new resources, new technology and new investment opportunities around the globe. The U.S. has its shale bonanza, while China has led the way with an aggressive array of international deals, covering everything from shale gas in North America, pipelines across Myanmar, stakes in Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects and Caspian Sea oil and gas. India has been able to secure coal assets in Australia, Indonesia and Africa, and some good oil and gas assets in the Middle East and the Americas. But Chinese companies such as China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC) have had the muscle and the money to outbid Indian rival Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) for some of the most prospective oil and gas opportunities. In energy infrastructure such as international pipelines, China is way ahead of India, with a network of lines from Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Russia and Myanmar that delivers a steady supply of oil and gas. How Modi handles India's energy situation and the relationships he forges with Russia, China and the U.S. may well define his administration. Keeping up with demand . According to the International Energy Agency's latest World Energy Outlook, India will overtake China in the 2020s as the principal source of growth in global energy demand. By 2025 India will be the world's biggest coal importer. Modi prides himself that electricity is always on in his home state of Gujarat, where large coal-fired power stations run by groups such as Adani and Tata help deliver a surplus of power. That is certainly not the case for many other parts of the country -- more than 300 million people lack access to electricity, and a massive outage in July 2012 saw another 600 million across the northern, eastern and central parts of India lose power for two days. There are constant problems with energy infrastructure, ranging from the stability of the grid to supply-demand imbalances and illegal connections. Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) identifies energy as a ""national security issue"" in its policy manifesto, and says economic growth must not be ""negatively impacted"" by energy supply issues. If Modi is to achieve his goal of every Indian citizen having access to a house with water and power by 2022-23, then energy security becomes of paramount importance. The role of renewables such as solar and wind is expected to grow in India's energy mix, but coal will remain the backbone of power generation until at least 2025, supported by oil and gas, hydro and nuclear power. Even with extensive coal deposits at home -- state-owned Coal India Ltd is the world's single biggest coal producer with an output of 462 million metric tons in the financial year that ended on March 31 -- India's domestic energy sources run well below demand. That means it must import thermal coal from suppliers such as Australia and Indonesia, oil and gas from the Middle East and Africa, and uranium from Russia, France and Kazakhstan. By the end of this decade, LNG from North America will enter India's supply equation. Divide and conquer . Diversity of fuel types and suppliers is a key part of Modi's energy security platform, which is why he wants to explore options such as a gas pipeline from Russia. There is a long-standing proposal to bring in gas from the Central Asian nation of Turkmenistan through a pipeline that would cross Pakistan and Afghanistan. This is the TAPI pipeline, which has been on the books for almost 20 years but has been stalled by the geopolitics of India-Pakistan hostility and the long-running conflict in Afghanistan. Another proposed pipeline from Iran to India would also have to cross Pakistan, rendering both projects problematic for now. That makes a Russian pipeline running through its Altai region into northwest China and then to northern India a possibility, albeit a costly one. During their annual summit in Moscow last October, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Modi's prime ministerial predecessor Manmohan Singh agreed to delve further into land-based hydrocarbon supply options such as the pipeline. Modi says India-Russia relations have stood the test of time, and he wants to further strengthen them, which suggests that India may be keen to buy more Russian oil and gas in future. Price and delivery options will be the usual sticking points. Modi says China is a country he can do business with, but energy competition between the two is likely to remain high. India is partnering with Vietnam to explore for oil in the same South China Sea waters where China's recent oil rig movements have brought China-Vietnam relations to an unhappy low. For its part, China says it is willing to make joint efforts with the new Indian government and ""bring the China-India strategic partnership to a new height."" India-U.S. relations should improve under Modi's pro-business outlook. His ""minimum government, maximum governance"" approach resonates with President Barack Obama, who has already invited Modi to visit the U.S. Domestic supply . Indian companies such as Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries and state-run gas utility GAIL have invested in the U.S. shale sector to gain exposure to the new technologies being used there. Some of this may be translated back to India's nascent shale gas sector, where recent estimates by the U.S. Energy Information Administration suggest India has 2.7 trillion cubic meters (tcm) of risked, technically recoverable resources. In comparison, the United States has 33 tcm and China 31.5 tcm. Argentina, Algeria, Canada, Mexico and Australia also have potentially large fields, as do Russia, Brazil and South Africa. The reality is that the hydraulic fracturing or ""fracking"" technique used to unlock shale reserves is highly water-intensive, meaning that India's chronic water shortage will have a big bearing on how many shale fields are developed. Still, Modi's policy is clear: India will not put all its energy eggs in one basket, and developing its domestic supply capacity is a priority.","How India's new PM handles the nation's energy may define his administration, says Hiscock .
Modi is likely to compete and cooperate with other major energy consumers .
India is expected to overtake China as the main source of growth in global energy demand .
Developing India's domestic supply capacity is a priority for the prime minister ."
"(CNN) -- There are few things more annoying than listening to ignorant, whiny parents complain about a school district teaching their children about sex. How in the world do we say it's OK for schools to teach our children about math, science, history, and numerous other subjects, yet then get high and mighty with righteous indignation when biology is taken a step further to focus on sex? Too many parents live in denial about their children having sex, and somehow saying you'll handle the tough stuff is living in fantasy land. The city of New York should be commended for not bowing to the blowhards and confronting the reality of sex in America by mandating a sex education curriculum beginning in 2012. Whether it's safe sex practices or even abstinence, all of these issues must be dealt with in an educational setting, because when we look at the teen pregnancy rates, sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS, it only makes sense to have as much education as possible. Taxes and death are considered two undeniably realities of life. I would say that sex is right behind those two. I recall as an elementary student, as well as in middle school and high school, taking classes that dealt with sex. Yes, elementary school. It was done properly and smartly, and was needed. Did it prevent children from getting pregnant too soon? I can't say for sure. But I can definitely say knowing more about a topic than less is crucial. Now let's deal with the abstinence-only nuts who act as if anything else shouldn't be taught. Yes, I'm talking directly to The NYC Parents' Choice Coalition. They are upset with videos demonstrating how to put on a condom, as well as other aspects of the sex education curriculum. Folks, y'all are flat out crazy if you want to encourage parents to opt out of sex education by making it more about abstinence and nothing else. Why can't both take place? Abstinence is definitely the safest of all safe sex measures, but there is also a point when we have to accept reality. Talk to school teachers and administrators and they will tell you that students as young as middle school are engaging in oral sex, and there is the belief that that really doesn't count as sex. Yet anyone with half a brain knows that to be the case. If kids are out there having oral sex, they sure as heck need to know that doing so without protection can be life-altering. But such parents groups prefer to stick their heads in the sand. They find such talk unseemly and think such frankness should be left between child and parent. Not me. As a Jesus lovin' Christian, I'm about real talk, and if that means dealing with sex directly, let's go for it. Educators and city officials in New York should fully brace themselves for the onslaught. Right-thinking folks are tired of seeing young folks coming back HIV-positive or dealing with a pregnancy at 16. I have nine nieces and four nephews, and I would be fully supportive of them being taught about sex education in school. Forget shying from a tough subject. If we are going to equip our children for tomorrow, then sex needs to be dealt with in a smart, productive and educational setting by professionals. It's clear that parents aren't as dependable on some matters as they like to delude themselves into believing. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.","NYC should be commended for mandating sex education, Roland Martin says .
Safe sex and abstinence must be dealt with in an educational setting, he says .
Martin: While abstinence is definitely safest, we have to accept reality."
"(CNN) -- The surprise announcement on Thursday that Eric Holder will resign as attorney general has D.C. buzzing. And the big question on everyone's mind: Who will replace him? Holder has been in his position since the start of President Barack Obama's first term. In fact, he's one of only three remaining original members of Obama's Cabinet (Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack are the others.) The attorney general also is a close personal friend of Obama, and sources tell CNN that the President will be looking to appoint a successor with whom he has a relationship. Eric Holder's legacy . So who might be chosen to fill Holder's shoes? Here's a list of seven candidates who definitely will be in the mix for the job, in no particular order. Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick . Deval Patrick is one of the names consistently floated as a hypothetical replacement for Holder. Patrick worked as an assistant attorney general in the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department during the Clinton administration, and is a friend of Obama. The timing is also convenient for Patrick. He's not seeking reelection in Massachusetts and will be out of his job come January. Patrick would likely face a tough confirmation in the Senate though, and particularly if Republicans take back control of the upper chamber in the midterm elections. Plus, he might have his eye on a bigger job. There has been speculation that he's considering a presidential run in 2016. Obama said in an interview with a local Boston news station earlier this year that he thinks Patrick ""would make a great president or vice president."" Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. The nation's top lawyer, Donald Verrilli Jr., is another name mentioned as a potential new AG. Verrilli has served as solicitor general since 2011, and in that role he's argued several landmark cases before the Supreme Court on behalf of the administration, including the Affordable Care Act case. Before he took over as solicitor general -- replacing Elena Kagan after her confirmation to the Supreme Court -- Verrilli served as deputy counsel to Obama. One potential con for Verrilli though is that he is an older white male, and the administration may be looking to replace Holder with a younger or more diverse candidate. California Attorney General Kamala Harris . A rising star in the Democratic Party, Kamala Harris is another person whose name will definitely be thrown into the conversation. Harris is the first female, the first African-American and the first Asian-American attorney general in California. Well-known in California for her legal work, Harris might be best remembered on the national level for the small controversy last year that occurred after the President referred to her as ""the best-looking attorney general"" at a fundraiser in California. Like Deval Patrick however, Harris would likely face a tough Senate confirmation, particularly in a Republican-controlled Senate, because she is seen as very liberal. Kathy Ruemmler, former White House counsel . Ruemmler served as White House counsel from 2011 until earlier this year. She's a close confidante of the president and very well-respected sources tell CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger that Ruemmler is indeed a strong contender for the job. One potential knock on her, Borger notes, is her former role as the president's lawyer might raise questions about how independent a Justice Department under her rule would be from the administration. Preet Bharara, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York . Like Holder, Bharara has served in the Obama administration for six years. Bharara was nominated to serve as the U.S. attorney for New York's Southern District (which encompasses Bronx, New York and Westchester counties, among others) in May 2009. Sources tell Borger that Bharara's name is certainly on the list, but a potential factor working against him is that he's not well-known to many people, including the President. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson . Before he became the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security last year, Jeh Johnson was a lawyer for the Department of Defense. Working in Johnson's favor: He was confirmed 78-16 to his current post. Working against Johnson: Removing him from DHS would put Obama in the position of finding a replacement -- not ideal right now, given the new threats from ISIS and the Khorasan group. Loretta Lynch, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York . In May, 2010 Lynch was appointed to serve as the U.S. attorney in New York's Eastern District, which includes high-profile areas like Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island, for a second time. She previously served in that job toward the end of the Clinton administration, from 1999 to 2001. Although she may not have the same national name recognition as others on the list, a source tells CNN's Gloria Borger that Lynch is a known quantity to Obama. CNN's Evan Perez and Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.","Attorney General Eric Holder to step down from his position after high-profile tenure .

"Stilwell, Oklahoma (CNN) -- As a teenager, Ricky Blackman carried an Oklahoma driver's license with the words ""sex offender"" stamped in red below his picture. His crime? Having sex with a 13-year-old girl when he was 16. The offense occurred when he lived in Iowa, and the label followed him to Oklahoma. As a Tier 3 offender on Oklahoma's sex offender registry, Blackman could not attend high school, visit the town library, or go to his younger brother's football games. But the label did more than limit where Blackman could go. It transformed him from an outgoing, sociable jock into an introvert who has trouble trusting people, his mother says. ""He's not the same,"" said Mary Duval, a straight-talker who has become a full-time activist to reform sex offender legislation since her son's conviction. ""I used to get a kick out of Ricky,"" she added. ""He was so fun-loving and just full of life. I mean, there's no other word. Ricky was full of life and now he's definitely more cautious, more reserved."" Now 20, Blackman tenses up when he sees children at a supermarket and avoids talking to girls his age, even if they initiate contact, his mother says. ""I got a lot more fear in me, I mean, because anything could happen,"" Blackman said. ""Say you're on the registry, and you're in the mall and a kid comes up missing. Well, guess what? You're the first person they're going to because you're on the sex offender registry."" Blackman lived with the ""sex offender"" label for nearly four years, until a law that took effect in Oklahoma in November removed his name from the registry. His soft-spoken, reserved manner belies Blackman's hulking physical presence -- a reminder of his days as a high school athlete. On a sunny afternoon in December, he met a CNN reporter in the parking lot of the Stilwell Public Library, arm-in-arm with his mother, who is blind. As he told his story, Blackman cast furtive glances at each passing car and sized up every person entering the library as if to ensure no one was after him. It was his first time at the library since 2006, when he moved back to his hometown. Though free of the scarlet letter that changed his life, he still feels the stigma of one of the country's most reviled labels. It was all but impossible to independently verify details of Blackman's case. Prosecutors did not return repeated phone calls for comment, and efforts to check court files with Iowa's Fifth Judicial District were also unsuccessful because Blackman's record has been expunged. But Blackman tells it this way: It all began when he met a girl at a teen club in Des Moines. They hit it off and started dating. He was 16 and thought she was 15. When the girl ran away from home, police came looking for Blackman, who says he admitted to having sex with her twice. That's when police told him she was really 13, he says. Two weeks later, police returned to his home and arrested him. Blackman pleaded guilty to one count of sexual abuse for having sex with the 13-year-old. The age of consent in Iowa is 14. Taking into account the circumstances of the case, an Iowa judge accepted Blackman's plea and ordered that his record be expunged if he successfully completed probation and sex offender treatment. At that time, his name would be removed from Iowa's sex offender registry. After his conviction, Blackman's family moved to Oklahoma to get a fresh start. He finished his probation and sex offender treatment, and his record in Iowa was expunged in October 2008, according to court documents. But the action did not carry over to Oklahoma, where Blackman continued to be listed on that state's sex offender registry. The stigma followed him to his new home and the harassment continued, the family said. A neighbor who found out he was on the registry videotaped him when he went outside, Blackman said. His picture and address were posted on a vigilante Web site, and a gas station attendant refused to sell him cigarettes, one time taking his license and throwing it across the store. To comply with state residency restrictions that prevent registered sex offenders from living within 2,000 feet of a school or day care center, the family moved onto a small plot of land in the rural southeastern Oklahoma community of Stilwell, population 3,500. The back door of the single-wide trailer faces the forest, a fact that Blackman's mother finds comforting should her sons ever need to escape a vigilante attack. ""Does it sound crazy? Yes. But knowing that my boys will have a few extra seconds to get out of the house and slip into darkness if someone ever comes provides some measure of comfort,"" Duval said. Having a son on the registry also made a lasting impression on his mother. She now devotes most of her time to reforming sex offender legislation --specifically, the registry -- as chief operating officer of Sex Offender Solutions And Education Network. ""What keeps me going? My anger, my guilt,"" she said. ""My ignorance is why Ricky's on this registry, or was on this registry. I didn't know the law. I didn't know how to protect my son when he talked to those cops. I just sat there thinking the truth will set him free. And that's what got Ricky convicted, the truth."" Blackman's story comes at a time of increased push-back against sex offender policies that some see as overly broad. Many states have been resisting toughening their sex offender policies. Only one state, Ohio, has complied with the federal Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, which lists sex offenders as young as 14 on a uniform registry. In Georgia, the Southern Center for Human Rights is challenging a state law prohibiting sex offenders from living and working within 1,000 feet of a school, church or day care. Georgia's laws go so far as to ban sex offenders from living near bus stops. The case is still pending. Last summer, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against Miami-Dade County, alleging the county's 2,500-foot residency restriction interfered with Florida's ability to monitor and supervise released offenders. With nowhere to live, dozens of homeless sex offenders clustered under the Julia Tuttle Causeway. The lawsuit was dismissed in September 2009. Meanwhile, Blackman was just trying to graduate from high school. He attempted to enroll but was told that he was considered a danger to the rest of the students. He couldn't take GED classes at the vocational school in town because of an on-campus day care center. His mother persuaded the school board to provide him with a tutor and private classes at the local police department, under the supervision of an officer. Finding a job presented its own challenges. He says he was turned down by Wal-Mart, McDonald's and another fast food outlet that told him he was considered a liability. He spent most days at home learning to build Web sites and helping his mother and brother. Due in large part to the efforts of his mother, the Oklahoma Legislature last year passed the law that makes expungements of certain sex offenses in other jurisdictions applicable in Oklahoma. Blackman traded in his driver's license for one that does not label him a sex offender, and has since returned to the mall and a movie theater. ""I know what I did was wrong and I deserved to be punished for it. But this destroyed my life. Took it away from me,"" he said. ""You never forget about it. I know I'm off the registry but it's taking a long time for it to settle in."" In November, Blackman received a letter from the Oklahoma Board of Probation and Parole. It said he had been removed from the state's sex offender registry, where he had been designated the highest level of risk possible. His return to a ""normal"" life has been slow. He still is reluctant to go to his brother's football games, and the thought of going to places where children convene makes him nervous. ""I know I'm off the registry but others may not know,"" he said. ""I don't want to go somewhere and cause a scene 'cause people may not know that I'm allowed to be there and get upset."" But he is making progress. He has opened up to friends and relatives outside his immediate family. He married a 19-year-old childhood friend after he completed probation in September. As a Christmas gift to her, Blackman made his way to the Stilwell High School Fine Arts Winter Celebration, where his wife sang in the choir. Walking arm-in-arm with his mother into a building from which he once had been banned, he slowly made his way up the gymnasium's bleachers. From his seat in the fifth row next to relatives, Blackman trained his eyes on people entering the gymnasium, cautiously returning a wave or smile from an acquaintance. How did he feel? ""Nervous,"" he said. ""It's still new to me."" CNN's Stephanie Chen contributed to this report.","Ricky Blackman landed on the sex offender registry when he was 16 .

"(CNN) -- World cycling's governing body, the International Cycling Union (UCI), have expressed their concern at the financial situation surrounding Lance Armstrong's Astana team. Armstrong (fourth left) and his team-mates could be riding for a new sponsor if the team's money problems continue. The team, which apart from Armstrong has a number of high-profile riders including current Giro d'Italia and Vuelta Espana champion Alberto Contador and top American Levi Leipheimer, is financially supported by a consortium of Kazakh-based companies. However, with the global recession continuing to bite, the Kazakh cycling federation has already been forced to overcome a shortfall in riders' salaries this year. This comes amid reports that the team's sponsors are reluctant to commit further, a situation that could lead to the UCI to withdraw Astana's professional racing licence. UCI president Pat McQuaid will travel to the city of Astana, the Kazakhstan capital, later this month to discuss the matter and try to find a resolution. ""He (McQuaid) will take the opportunity to talk about that, because we are concerned,"" Enrico Carpani, the UCI's chief press officer, told Press Association Sport. Astana are among the starters for this year's Giro, which begins in Venice on Saturday, but doubts remain whether the team will appear in the same guise for the 2009 Tour de France, which begins in Monaco on July 4. A team spokesman was adamant the issue can be resolved. Philippe Maertens told Press Association Sport. ""For the moment, there is no problem. If the sponsors pay again, nothing is lost."" If the sponsors fail to stump up the required revenue, team chief Johann Bruyneel, who mentored Armstrong to all seven of his Tour de France victories, could have a number of options which should see them able to continue, including finding another title sponsor. Cancer survivor Armstrong returned to cycling this year, after a three-year absence, to promote his Livestrong campaign and the battle against the illness. The 37-year-old American is immune to Astana's financial plight as he does not receive a salary from the team, relying on his long-term sponsors such as Nike, Oakley and Trek. Because of Armstrong's unique situation within the team there is also the possibility that the American could take over sponsorship himself, to further promote the Lovestrong campaign, or have the necessary contacts to bring in another major sponsor.","The International Cycling Union have expressed concern at Astana's situation .

"(CNN) -- ""White people adopt black kids to make themselves feel good... A black child needs black parents to raise it."" ""Maybe she adopted one because the blacks in the community wouldn't step forward and adopt?"" ""What's the big deal? If no white person ever adopted a black child, they'd be saying why don't white people adopt black children."" ""Who cares what race they are? A woman got a child, a child got a mother...it's BEAUTIFUL!!! And yes I am black...if it matters."" These impassioned comments and thousands more poured in earlier this week when CNN published a story on the stirred-up debate surrounding Sandra Bullock's recent adoption. A People magazine cover photo of the actress beaming at her newly adopted black infant son, and the discussions that have followed, clearly hit a nerve. So when it comes to transracial adoptions in this country, where are we? Stacey Bush is the white child of a black mother whose adoption sparked controversy and whose attitude forces people to think about the issue differently. Stacey wouldn't change a thing about her life, which is saying a lot for a young woman who spent her early childhood being neglected and bounced through the foster-care system. That was before a drawn-out legal case ended in 1998, allowing a single black woman, Regina Bush -- the only mother Stacey had ever loved -- to become her forever mom. The Michigan lawsuit was filed when a county agency cited concerns about ""cultural issues"" in an attempt to keep the pair apart. Regina Bush's adoption of Stacey's biracial half-sister had already been completed, without challenge, and Bush says she wanted to keep the girls together. (As a matter of full disclosure, this CNN writer's late father represented Regina Bush in the case.) At 21, Stacey is thriving in college, well on her way to becoming an early-childhood educator and seamlessly moving between worlds. In one day, she might braid the hair of black friends, address faculty at Central Michigan University where she is on a partial multicultural scholarship, and then go salsa dancing with her Latina sorority sisters. ""People are sometimes startled. 'She's white, but she doesn't seem white,'"" she says with a laugh. ""I can relate to everyone. I like being exposed to everything. ... Seeing me, hearing me -- it doesn't matter what color you're raised just as long as someone loves you."" Forty percent of children adopted domestically and internationally by Americans are a different race or culture from their adoptive parents, according to a 2007 National Survey of Adoptive Parents, the most recent study of its kind conducted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Legislation passed by Congress in 1994 and 1996 prohibits agencies getting federal help from discriminating against would-be parents based on race or national origin. How adoptive parents have approached transracial adoptions has changed with time, says Chuck Johnson, acting chief executive of the National Council for Adoption. ""In the old days, meaning the '70s and '80s, there was this notion that these parents need to be colorblind. This sounds wonderful, but by being colorblind you're denying they're of a different race and culture,"" Johnson says. ""Families that are successful are those that acknowledge race. ... It's not a curse. It's not an impossible feat. They just need to work harder to give a child a sense of self-identity."" It may be ideal and less complicated to match children available for adoption with same-race, same-culture families, says Johnson, who advocates that children be raised in their own countries whenever possible, too. ""But timeliness is of the utmost importance,"" he says. ""It's better to find permanency and a loving home."" The latest figures show that there are 463,000 American kids in the foster-care system, of which 123,000 are available for adoption, Johnson says. Of those, he says, 30 percent are black, 39 percent are white, 21 percent are Hispanic and the rest are of other origins. Seventy-three percent of official adoptions -- including those arranged through foster care, private domestic arrangements and internationally -- are done by whites, according to the 2007 survey of adoptive parents. But that doesn't account for informal arrangements, when relatives take in other family members' children, which is much more common in the black community, says Toni Oliver, vice-president elect of the National Association of Black Social Workers. She says the black community takes in ""more children than the whole foster care system does,"" although Johnson adds that often these arrangements don't have the safeguards and protections legal adoptions provide. When handled well, transracial adoption is ""a very positive thing,"" says Rita Simon, who has been studying these adoptions for 30 years and has written 65 books, including ""Adoption, Race & Identity: From Infancy to Young Adulthood."" ""But love is not enough,"" said Simon, a professor of justice and public policy at American University in Washington. ""You really have to make some changes in your life if you adopt a child of another race."" In the case of a white parent adopting a black child, that might mean living in an integrated neighborhood, having pictures in the home of black heroes, seeking out other families in similar situations, attending a black church and finding role models or godparents who are black. The same need to integrate a child's culture applies across the board, whether parents are adopting from Asia, Central America or elsewhere. ""It helps make our society more integrated,"" said Simon, who has five biracial grandchildren. ""Race becomes less important and other kinds of identity issues become more important."" Bill Barry and his wife, Joan Jacobson, adopted two boys as newborns. Willie, 17, is biracial and Alex, 15, is black. Race never mattered to the white couple when they set out to adopt, after it became clear they wouldn't be able to bear children on their own. ""We simply wanted a healthy newborn,"" Barry says. ""We didn't care about race, didn't care about sex, and we knew we wanted them locally."" Had the family uprooted to white suburbia, he suspects, the journey might have been more challenging. As it is, the kids go to public schools in Baltimore, Maryland, live in a multiracial and multicultural environment and grew up in a house where pictures of Paul Robeson and Rosa Parks hung on the walls. But Barry says he and his wife didn't ""go way overboard."" The white pair didn't, for example, suddenly start celebrating Kwanzaa. ""My wife is Jewish, though not so practicing, and we did Christmas and Hanukkah. Double the presents -- they quickly celebrated that,"" he says. ""Kids are always trying to figure out their identity and who they are, and race is just part of it."" That may be true, but the National Association of Black Social Workers has long argued for keeping black children in black homes. About 40 years ago, the association released a four-page position paper on transracial adoption in which it went so far as to call such adoptions ""genocide"" -- and that word choice has dogged the organization ever since. But Oliver, the vice-president-elect, says when that position was written decades ago, blacks were being discounted as adoptive parents, not being given the same resources to help keep families together and thereby prevent the need for child placements, and that agencies weren't recruiting families within the community. By speaking strongly, the organization helped jolt the system -- although more still needs to be done, she says. The preference, Oliver says, remains that kids be placed in same-race households whenever possible. And if it isn't possible, or if a birth parent selects an adoptive family of a different race, then those adopting must be educated to understand ""the impact of race and racism on the country, their family and the child in particular,"" she says. ""There is a negative impact that children and families are going to experience based on race,"" she says. ""The idea that race doesn't matter is not true. We would like it to be true, but it's not."" Regina and Stacey Bush have faced challenges along the way. They've received their share of stares and under-the-breath comments like, ""What's this world coming to."" When a young Stacey once started climbing into the van to join her family at an Arby's restaurant, patrons came running to grab her, yelling that she was going into the wrong car. The girl was given detention at school, accused of lying because she called a young black boy her little brother, which he was. At a movie theater one time, someone called the police because they feared Stacey had been abducted. Regina says she got attacks from both sides. ""White babies were a precious commodity. 'Blacks can't take care of white children,'"" she remembers hearing. ""And blacks were outraged"" because there are so many black children in the system who need homes, and ""they didn't understand why a black woman wouldn't adopt one of her own."" But she says she simply wanted to keep Stacey and her half-sister in the same home and give them a loving family, together. Stacey says that upbringing taught her to embrace all people. ""It gave me so much opportunity to talk to so many different people. There were no limitations. I stood up for a lot of things, and it made me break peoples' mind-sets,"" she says. ""We're accountable for each other as brothers and sisters. We need to look out for each other because at the end of the day we're all human beings.""","Impassioned readers weigh in on transracial adoption amid Sandra Bullock news .

"(CNN) -- Why always him? Mario Balotelli's knack of attracting the wrong type of headlines shows no sign of abating after the enigmatic forward was charged by the English Football Association with racially stereotyping Jewish and black people in a social media post. The FA is looking into Balotelli's reposting of a Nintendo character Super Mario image that underneath had the words ""jumps like a black man and grabs coins like a jew."" ""Mario Balotelli has been charged by The FA in relation to a recent posting on social media,"" read the statement. ""It is alleged the Liverpool player breached FA Rule E3[1] in that his posting was abusive and/or insulting and/or improper. ""It is further alleged that this is an 'Aggravated Breach' as defined by FA Rule E3[2] as it included a reference to ethnic origin and/or color and/or race and/or nationality and/or religion or belief. ""The player has until 6pm on 15 December 2014 to respond to the charge."" Balotelli quickly deleted the Instagram image, before tweeting: ""My Mom is jewish so all of u shut up please,"" a reference to his foster mother, Silvia. He apologized Tuesday on Twitter explaining the post ""was meant to be anti-racist with humor."" He added: ""I now understand that out of context may have the opposite effect. Not all Mexicans have mustaches, not all black people jump high and not all Jewish people love money. ""I used a cartoon done by someone else because it has Super Mario and I thought it was funny and not offensive. Again, I'm sorry."" Liverpool said they plan to speak to Balotelli, who has missed the club's last three games due to a groin injury he picked up on international duty in November. ""We are aware of the posting which has since been promptly deleted by the player,"" said Liverpool in a statement. However, former FA executive Simon Johnson called on the FA to punish the 24-year-old Balotelli. ""We abhor all forms of racism, wherever it is found,"" Johnson, who is the current chief executive of the UK Jewish Leadership Council, told the Daily Telegraph. ""We call upon the FA to investigate this offensive social media post and to take action if appropriate if we are to succeed in kicking racism out of football."" Playing iIn Italy, Balotelli frequently faced racist abuse in stadiums, while in September Merseyside police investigated racist remarks on Twitter made to Balotelli after he posted a message during Manchester United's 5-3 defeat against Leicester City. Balotelli has yet to score a Premier League goal since joining Liverpool from AC Milan in the summer transfer window, though he did find the net against Ludogorets in the Champions League as well as against Swansea in the English League Cup. The minimum ban for race-related rule breaches is five games under the FA's social media guidelines.","Mario Balotelli charged by English Football Association .

"Editor's note: The staff at CNN.com has been intrigued by the journalism of VICE, an independent media company and Web site based in Brooklyn, New York. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Santo Tomas, Peru (VICE) -- The town of Santo Tomas is 12,000 feet above sea level, nestled cozily in the vertiginous Peruvian Andes. Hill dwellers and mountain folk alike have had a reputation for hardiness and endurance ever since ancient Greek geographer Strabo described the Thracian people as a ""tough bunch of customers."" Being raised on the side of a cliff anywhere tends to favor the strong, sure-footed and stocky, and the environment of the Andes is a particularly punishing place to grow up. The slopes are craggy, storm-blasted and steep, and food is pretty much limited to potatoes and whatever animals you can chase up a 50-grade incline without falling down the adjacent precipice. On top of that, altitude sickness generally kicks in around 8,000 feetâ€”setting up house anywhere higher is pretty much relegating yourself to a semi-permanent hangover. Maybe you see where I'm going with this, but people in these hills sometimes get a little bit testy. Just being a farmer here is like living your entire life getting ready to fight. Regions across the Peruvian and Bolivian Andes have traditional fighting festivals and ceremonies as an outlet for this type of mountain-born aggression. Rules about who fights whom and what weapons you can use (if any) vary from place to place, but the general gist remains the same, as does the expected goal of social catharsis and the collective venting of pent-up steam. In Santo Tomas, the festival is known as Takanakuy, everybody fights everybody, and it happens bright and early Christmas morning. After a few days of preliminary drinking and dancing in costumes that combine the best aspects of traditional Andean horse-riding gear with the most nightmarish aspects of traditional acid trips, the residents of Santo Tomas wake up and head to the local bullfighting ring to beat each other silly. Men, women, children, the elderly, the infirm and (especially) the inebriated -- they all pair off, wrap their bare hands with scarves, and give each other a friendly hug before walloping each other full-force in the face. While there are local referees with Roman-style whips to keep the fights from getting too one-sided and an entire crowd to rush in if anybody hits someone on the ground, the level of violence is still miles beyond what goes on in the average boxing or UFC ring. And often with good cause. The same rugged mountains that imbue the Santo Tomasans with their sturdy physiques and penchant for hitting each other also separate the town from the rest of the country. The geographical department of Chumbivilcas, for which Santo Tomas serves as the capital, is historically one of the poorest in Peru and cut off not only geographically from the power centers and financial interests of the Pacific coast, but most resources and government services thereof. The Chumbivilcas police force boasts a whopping three officers, and the nearest courthouse to Santo Tomas is a nauseating, 12-hour car ride on the windiest, most rock-strewn South American road this side of William Friedkin's ""Sorceror."" The Peruvian legal system basically doesn't extend into the hills of this region, so instead of packing into a van every time they've got a beef with their neighbor, the residents of Chumbivilcas save up their grievances all year then take justice into their own fists at Takanakuy. Property disputes, stolen girlfriends, stolen boyfriends, stolen sheep, spilled beer -- all issues big and small fall within the bounds of Takanakuy's physical jurisprudence. While not everyone fights over a serious legal matter -- the better part of combatants just do so for sport or because they're drunk -- those who do so are bound by the results of the match and are generally satisfied by them win or lose (although there have been occasional, impromptu ""appeals""). See the rest of Takanakuy at VICE.com . I went to last year's Takanakuy in Santo Tomas and the nearby village of Llique, where I met a legal student from Lima who'd made the same tortuous trek as I had to watch the fighting. ""The average villager in this region has basically no access to lawyers or courts, and even if they travel to a place where they do, odds are the ultimate judgment will not be in their favor. Using violence as a means of solving disputes may seem barbaric to people in the cities, but as you can see, the fighting here is all carefully controlled and the people involved get an immediate and cathartic result,"" he told me as we watched two teenage girls pounding each other's visibly contused eye sockets with their bleeding fists. ""I've also found that what we're witnessing right now holds closer to the true spirit of English common law than the Roman-influenced court system that the Spanish brought over."" Not exactly sure how accurate that is, but still, hell of a nice way to spend your Christmas.","Takanakuy is an event that gives people the chance to solve differences through fighting .

"(CNN) -- Fox News contributor and Republican as of 2012, black actress Stacey Dash proves she really wasn't acting in the movie ""Clueless."" Appearing on Fox News' ""Hannity"" show, Dash called all black people in Louisiana government freeloaders who don't work. Sean Hannity asked Dash: ""Has voting with Obama 95% of the time and Obamacare, has that helped the minority community in Louisiana?"" ""No, not at all. It still keeps them stuck. They're getting money for free. They feel worthless. They're uneducated. I mean, as long as you are that way, they can keep you under their control ..."" ""They have a plantation mentality,"" Dash said. ""As long as they give you this much money, you'll stay right there. You don't need to know too much because if you do, you might start thinking for yourself."" I think Stacey Dash needs to get out more, perhaps visit Louisiana and the rest of America and see that all blacks, myself included, certainly don't feel ""worthless"" under President Barack Obama's administration. Whether Democratic or Republican, scores of black people -- Oprah Winfrey, Allen West, Condoleezza Rice, Ben Carson, Shelby Steele, Bill Cosby, Robin Roberts, and many many others -- are highly educated, gainfully employed, paying their bills and frankly doing quite well. Dash is one of them. Many black people may want Obama to provide more productive policies, but to suggest, as Dash does, that blacks are largely ""uneducated"" and ""getting money for free"" is a racist narrative that conservatives need to stop perpetuating. That kind of talk is an offensive nonstarter in getting blacks to consider voting Republican. So is the often repeated meme by some black conservatives that blacks ""have a plantation mentality."" Whether you're white or black, it's never cool to invoke metaphors of slavery, which was a gruesome, painful institution protected by Democrats in America that went on way too long. Conservatives should remind Americans of the history of slavery and how the Democratic Party perpetuates policies of paternalism that don't benefit blacks. The ""Hannity"" segment was about the Louisiana Senate race between Democratic incumbent Sen. Mary Landrieu and Republicans Bill Cassidy and Rob Maness. Dash and other guests discussed how blacks in Louisiana have voted for Landrieu since electing her in 1997 but have not benefited from it. Black Republican Deroy Murdock gave a much more reasoned commentary on why black people need to reconsider their blind allegiance to Democrats. Referring to an ad produced by black Republican Louisiana State Sen. Elbert Guillory focusing on Landrieu's record with blacks, Murdock said: . ""I think state Sen. Guillory has done a tremendous job and service, by asking in this ad a very basic question: What have the Democrats done for us lately? Black folks show up and vote 95% for Obama, 95% for Landrieu and ...what do you get? Eighteen years of poverty under Mary Landrieu in Louisiana."" Murdock said that under Obama's presidency, black poverty and dependence on food stamps has increased and home ownership has declined. Fact-based comments such as Murdock's raise eyebrows and invite blacks voting for the Democratic Party to consider voting for Republicans. Dash's comments are insulting and give blacks another reason to tune out the GOP and not take our party seriously.","Black Republican Stacey Dash, an actress, called Louisiana blacks freeloaders .

"(CNN) -- Gary Sinise has played many characters on television and the big screen, but one of his most important roles in real life is fighting for veterans. ""I have a passionate love for our country. I know that our freedom is provided by men and women, ordinary men and women who take up the call and serve our country,"" he says. ""We can never forget our defenders, and we should do everything we can for them before the battle, during the battle and after the battle when things get rough for them. We should take care of them."" And that's just what the actor is doing through programs at The Gary Sinise Foundation. The nonprofit helps veterans translate their military skills to civilian careers, sponsors military scholarships and even helps build customized homes for the severely wounded. ""If you're a quadruple amputee, you've lost both arms and both legs, you're going to have some physical challenges for the rest of your life. We want your home to be the most secure, safe, manageable place in your life,"" explains Sinise. In partnership with Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation, homes are built with smart technology such as automated doors and iPad-controlled electronics. Cpl. Christian Brown, who lost both legs serving in Afghanistan, is looking forward to gaining more independence after he moves into his specialized house. ""Sometimes I get so focused on the small things that are easy for you but hard for me,"" the Marine says. ""And now I actually have to think my way through them. So it's actually very tiring mentally and just to be able to scoot through your house and do the things you need to do, whether that be laundry, you know, use the bathroom, get to a certain area of the house without actually having to put so much thought into it. I think it'll be relief."" The Gary Sinise Foundation raises money for these homes by hosting concerts featuring The Lt. Dan Band. Sinise plays bass in the group he named after his iconic character from the 1994 movie ""Forrest Gump."" ""I never thought years ago that when I was in my 50s I'd be playing concerts all over the world,"" says the Oscar-nominated actor. ""It's part of my overall mission to raise spirits, raise awareness and raise funds to support the men and women who serve our country."" Sinise was a passionate supporter of the military long before he played disabled Vietnam vet Lt. Dan. He comes from a family of men who served. ""My dad served in the Navy, my two uncles were in World War Two,"" he says. ""My grandfather served in World War One in the Army, drove an ambulance in France."" Sinise also has connections to the military through his wife, Moira. Her two brothers served in Vietnam. Her sister was in the Army and married a Vietnam veteran. Their son just returned from his second tour in Afghanistan. The success of ""Forrest Gump"" propelled Sinise to advocate for the military even more. He went to a Disabled American Veterans convention and received an award for playing Lt. Dan. ""I was very moved and touched by the people that I met and the actual wounded veterans from many wars prior,"" he remembers. ""But it also led me to an association with our wounded that now goes back 20 years."" The attacks of 9/11 reinforced Sinise's commitment to the troops. ""When our men and women started deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan, they started getting hurt and killed,"" he somberly states. ""Families started struggling and suffering in the military. Having Vietnam veterans in my family, remembering what happened to them when they came home, it was very troubling to think that our men and women would deploy in reaction to September 11th and come home to a nation that didn't appreciate them."" To show his appreciation, the actor visited service men and women all over the world through the USO and provided entertainment with The Lt. Dan Band. Eventually, The Gary Sinise Foundation was established. When it comes to identifying with wounded veterans, Brown says Sinise just ""gets it."" ""A lot of people don't get it. People don't even know what's going on over there or the severity of the situations that these guys come back in."" The double amputee adds, ""They never take a chance to look up from their phone and see what's going on around the world."" Maybe we can take a cue from Sinise and realize we don't have to wear a uniform to serve our country. We can simply honor, remember and care for wounded veterans in our communities.","Gary Sinise Foundation serves the needs of the military community .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Nyla was just two or three days old, no one really knows for sure, when she was found abandoned in the middle of a field in Rwanda. She was ""black and blue,"" says her adoptive mother, Karen Brown. Her umbilical cord was still attached. One year later, Nyla lives in a high-rise building in Hong Kong with American parents and a four-year-old sister who is Chinese. She just started walking and has ""seven-and-a-half"" teeth, though she's too shy to show them. The bright-eyed baby is one of more than 35,000 children sent from Africa in a surge of adoptions in the last eight years, according to adoption expert Peter Selman from Newcastle University in the UK. During that time, figures have risen three-fold at the same time as international adoptions from all countries have slumped to a 15-year low, Selman said. A new report from The African Child Policy Forum (ACPF) entitled ""Africa: The New Frontier for Intercountry Adoption,"" says the trend indicates that receiving countries are turning ""en masse"" to Africa to meet demand for adoptive children as other options close. It's a trend, they say, that needs to stop. ""It must at all costs be discouraged. It should be a last resort and an exception rather than the normal recourse to solving the situation of children in difficult circumstances, as it seems to have now become,"" said David Mugawe, executive director of the ACPF in a press statement. The group says that the lack of regulation combined with the promise of money from abroad had turned children into ""commodities in the graying and increasingly amoral world of intercountry adoption."" ""Due to the illegal nature of these acts, it has been difficult to properly document them, but it is known that there have been cases of children sold by their parents, and children abducted and later trafficked or even placed for adoption because wrongly considered orphans,"" said Najat M'jid Maalla, U.N. Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. Children's rights advocates are meeting in Ethiopia this week to consider what needs to be done to protect the continent's children at the Fifth International Policy Conference on the African Child (IPC). The ACPF is urging African leaders to seek family-based, national solutions to care for the estimated 58 million children on the continent who have been orphaned by war, famine and disease. ""Every child should have an inalienable right to be nurtured and reared in the country and culture in which they are born,"" Mugawe said. See also: Should race be a factor in adoption? In the eight years from 2003 to 2010, more than half of the children adopted from Africa came from Ethiopia (22,282), followed by South Africa (1,871), Liberia (1,355) and Madagascar (1,331) and Nigeria (1,118), according to Selman. Of those, only South Africa and Madagascar have ratified the 1993 Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. Compliance with the Convention typically leads to a fall in adoption from those countries as they work to satisfy demands for greater transparency, the ACPF said. However, sharp increases in adoption rates from non-Hague Convention countries exposed a ""deeply troubling"" trend of shifting demand, according to a second report released by the group Tuesday, ""Intercountry Adoption: An African Perspective."" ""Demand transfers to other countries where Hague protections do not exist and where, all too often, the authorities are totally unprepared to cope with the sudden influx of applications and are unable to apply basic child protection safeguards,"" the report said. Among other safeguards, the Convention dictates that a Central Authority must ensure that adoption is in the best interests of the child. Only 13 -- or less than one third of -- African countries have signed the Convention, according to the ACPF. The majority of children adopted from Africa go to the United States or France, two of the world's biggest receiving countries, according to Selman. They're also the two countries that have experienced the greatest falls in international adoption rates in the past year, mostly due to a drop in adoptions from Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. Based on current but incomplete figures, Selman predicts international adoption rates will fall again in 2011, taking the total number to between 23,000 and 25,000 -- down about 50% since 2004. ""The general agreement is it's an issue of supply rather than demand. In other words, it's not that people don't want to adopt from abroad. It means that countries are less willing to send or we decide that they are operating so poorly that we don't want to receive them,"" he said. Any further reduction from Africa would put further pressure on countries still open to adoptions and create longer waiting lists for potential parents. ""There are many frustrated singles and couples who have been approved for adoptions and are waiting longer than they expected and some are feeling as though they will never get a child,"" Selman said. Nyla's parents Karen and Charlie Brown have just embarked on what they know will be a long campaign to adopt a third child. It has taken the couple seven years to adopt two children and as the number of adopting countries shrinks, so do their options. Rwanda, Nyla's birthplace, has temporarily suspended new adoptions while it works to implement the Hague Convention. Brown said she knows a lot of people who want to adopt who are now looking to Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Both have recorded sharp jumps in international adoption rates in recent years, according to Selman. Neither has ratified the Hague Convention. Brown is not sure if Nyla would have survived had she remained in the Rwandan orphanage. She was five months old and malnourished when they gained custody. ""She had antibiotic-resistant salmonella poisoning in her entire body. Her head was covered in ring worm. She brought home other health issues, a lot of which we've been able to eradicate. She's a healthy little girl... now,"" she said. As to the suggestion that the doors should be all but closed to international adoptions from Africa, Brown said it shouldn't matter where adoptive parents live. ""If there's a mum and dad and everybody knows your name and you have plenty of food and you get a great education and you're loved, I personally don't think it matters what country you're in,"" she said.","African children's rights groups calls for cut in international adoptions .

"(CNN) -- Gamers rejoiced over news that Blizzard Entertainment, the company behind popular role-playing game ""World of Warcraft,"" plans to release its first new franchise in 17 years. ""Overwatch"" is a team-based shooter game for computers set in a cartoonish version of the not-so-distant future in which a reformed band of heroes battles evil across the planet. Blizzard, which has built a global fanbase through its Warcraft, Starcraft and Diablo franchises, debuted ""Overwatch"" Friday in a cinematic-style trailer at BlizzCon 2014, the company's fan convention, this weekend at California's Anaheim Convention Center. The trailer was followed by a gameplay demonstration showing characters such as an armed gorilla and a pistol-wielding Reaper showing off their abilities. A beta version of ""Overwatch"" will be available to the public in 2015, game director Jeff Kaplan told the crowd. The game marks Blizzard's first foray into the multiplayer shooter genre and its first new franchise in 17 years. It comes on the heels of ""Heartstone,"" a World of Warcraft-inspired card game, and ""Heroes of the Storm,"" which features characters from other Blizzard games. ""Perhaps the most amazing thing about Overwatch is the fact that it was kept a total secret, a rarity in this industry,"" Paul Tassi wrote for Forbes. ""Many were guessing that Blizzard's big surprise was going to be a new Hearthstone expansion or something along those lines."" Immediate reaction to the announcement was mostly positive, though some wondered if Blizzard should just stick to its tried-and-true franchises. Some fans noted references and allusions to weapons and characters from other Blizzard games.","Gaming company Blizzard debuts ""Overwatch,"" first new franchise in years .

"(CNN) -- The past few weeks have been hard for 9-year-old Thomas Goodall, who lost his grandmother in early October. It was the first major loss of a loved one for the boy with autism from North Baddesley, England, who relies on a consistent routine to avoid meltdowns, his father, Ross Goodall, said . Things finally began to take a turn for better on Monday, when Thomas received a comforting video message from actor Peter Capaldi, who plays Thomas' favorite TV character on ""Doctor Who."" For the first time since his grandmother's death, Thomas smiled. ""I think it probably meant everything to him,"" his father told CNN. ""I think it gave him the emotional support that we as parents couldn't."" After Ross Goodall uploaded the video to YouTube on Thursday for family to see, others took notice and started sharing it, drawing more than 200,000 views in 48 hours. It didn't come out of the blue. Thomas comes from a household of Whovians, where sonic screwdrivers, robot Daleks and TARDIS time-travel machines make up much of the decor. What fate awaits ""Doctor Who"" in the finale? The fanaticism extends to Thomas' fashion choices. His signature outfit consists of a checkered shirt, suspenders and bow tie in honor of the 11th incarnation of the time-traveling doctor played by Matt Smith -- one of Thomas' favorite doctors. Other days, he wears a pair of Converse sneakers, 10th doctor David Tennant's trademark look. When Capaldi took over the role from Smith in 2013, it was a big deal for Thomas, Ross Goodall said. To help cope with the change, Thomas sent Capaldi a letter in September letting him know that he looks forward to following Capaldi's adventures as the new Doctor Who. Capaldi responded with a letter and autographed headshot. After Thomas' grandmother died, Ross Goodall reached out to Capaldi through his agent and explained that Thomas was having a hard time dealing with the death of his grandmother. Capaldi came through with the video. ""Thank you very much for your letter. I really enjoyed getting it because, you see, when Clara and I are traveling around time and space, sometimes bad things happen to us. And, you know what, Thomas, sometimes sad things happen to us, too, so it's nice to know that there's somebody like you out there who's on our side, and you should know that we're on your side.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Joshua Packwood knows what it's like to be a minority. Joshua Packwood, 22, will be the first white valedictorian at the historically black Morehouse College. This weekend he'll be the first white valedictorian to graduate from the historically black, all male Morehouse College in the school's 141-year history. Morehouse, in Atlanta, Georgia, is one the nation's most prestigious universities of its kind. For more than a century, the school has prided itself on personifying the dream of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., one of the school's most notable alums, by producing ""Morehouse Men"" - intelligent and successful black leaders. ""Because I'm one of the only white students, it's easy to call me 'the white boy,' I'm naturally going to stand out,"" says Packwood. But Packwood, 22, doesn't stand out solely because he is white or has maintained a 4.0 grade point average. For those who don't know him, what is surprising is that a Rhodes Scholar finalist turned down a full scholarship to Columbia University to attend the all-black men's university. This came naturally to Packwood, who attended a predominantly black high school. ""A large majority of my friends, like all my girlfriends have been minorities,"" says Packwood. ""So it was very, it was kind of strange that I always kind of gravitated to the black community."" Packwood fit in immediately at Morehouse. His charm, movie-star good looks and chiseled physique made him popular among students. He was elected dorm president and to class council during freshmen year - and was a favorite at campus fashion shows.  White valedictorian makes history » . He also gained worldly experience studying and traveling abroad. Life hasn't always been easy for Packwood. He grew up in a poor area of Kansas City, Missouri, where he says he found himself gravitating to the black community at a young age. Adolescence was rough. His mother's second marriage to a black man ended in divorce and family tension forced him to seek refuge with his best friend's family - who were black and middle-class. The experience of living with his best friend's family had a profound effect on Packwood, who says he saw a ""different side of black America."" During his teens, Packwood says he got into his share of fights and even landed in jail a few times. Still, his grades were good and eventually earned him a full scholarships to Morehouse College and Columbia University. Against the advice of some family members, Packwood gave up the scholarship to an Ivy League school. He felt the true college experience was at Morehouse - where he believed he would get more than an education. ""I gained this interest in African-American studies and I thought that Morehouse would probably be the best experience,"" says Packwood. ""I think of it in terms of 'study abroad.' If I really want to learn it, if I really want to understand it - maybe it's best if I immerse myself in the culture."" ""Mr. Packwood is deserving. He has earned this,"" says Dr. Robert Franklin, the president of Morehouse. ""We are committed to merit, to hard work - no matter who it might be."" For the most part, Packwood says the experience among his Morehouse brethren has been overwhelmingly good - with the exception of a few negative comments. ""One guy came up to me and told me -- he didn't like the fact that I was here,"" recalls Packwood. ""He absolutely didn't like the fact that I dated black women."" ""So I heard him out, and said, 'I appreciate your opinion but don't agree with what you have to say,'...and now we've become, not necessarily close, but very cool,"" Packwood says. That student, Vinson Muhammad, says he was curious about the reasons why someone like Packwood would choose to attend an all-black college. ""I don't necessarily support him being here, but because he's here and we can't discriminate against other races, I support him and his mission to be successful in life,"" says Muhammad, a junior. ""I just kind of wish he had done it at a different institution."" Even though he received the support of school administrators, Packwood's scholastic success did not come without some controversy. When word got out that he might become the next valedictorian, some of his classmates - even friends - were admittedly chafed. ""They approached me and said, 'Yeah, I have a problem with you being valedictorian. I know you've earned it and even though I know you on a personal level - I like you a lot - but it disturbs me that out of roughly 3,000 black men - there's not one that's done as well as or better than you academically,' "" says Packwood. Still, the majority of students told CNN that he earned his accolades and they stand behind him. Some say, if anything, Packwood's academic success should serve as a lesson to his fellow students. ""I think that it should be a wake-up call to an all black campus,"" says Muhammad. ""At Morehouse we're supposed to be at the top as black men. We only have a few white students and to see a white student will rise to this - is something unsettling to me because it shows that we need to work harder."" Campus administrators say that black or white, Packwood's experience is consistent with the school's mission: to produce future leaders. ""I think some of our alumni are a little nervous about a white student graduating from Morehouse with all of its rich history for producing African-American male leaders. But I don't think it's contradictory at all,"" says Sterling Hudson, the dean of admissions. Overall, Packwood says his experience is the best proof of Morehouse success, because the school was able to produce a white valedictorian - against the odds. He's eager to quote the school's most notable alums. ""What Morehouse stands for at the end of the day, and what Dr. King epitomized, it's not about black or white, it's about the content of [a person's] character,"" says Packwood. ""It's about me, representing Morehouse in that light -- not as a white man or a black man."" His experience was so positive that Packwood's younger brother, John, will follow in his footsteps when he enrolls as a freshman at the college next year. Could this type of recruitment signal a new trend for Morehouse and other historically black colleges and universities? ""We're not aggressively pursuing white students,"" says Hudson. ""But like every other college, we're interested in diversity. So, if a white student becomes interested in Morehouse - of course we are going to treat him like any other student."" For now, Packwood is enjoying his rise to the top. This week, he started his first job with the prestigious investment banking firm Goldman Sachs on Wall Street. But he'll be back at Morehouse Sunday wearing his cap and gown along with the 500 members of his graduating class. Not as a white man or a black man - but as a Morehouse Man. ""The interesting thing about Josh's experience is that he had a full Morehouse experience,"" says Hudson. ""When he marches across the stage on May 18 and receives his diploma, he's going to be a Morehouse Man in every way -- except ethnicity."" ""I don't think ethnicity makes the difference; it's what's in his heart."" Jackie Adams and Allen Huntspon contributed to this report.","Joshua Packwood, 22, will become first white valedictorian of Morehouse College .

"Editor's note: Deepak Chopra is the co-founder of the Chopra Foundation and author of ""Spiritual Solutions: Answers to Life's Greatest Challenges"", reveals how to find our inner strength. (Oprah.com) -- In an ideal world, the title of this article would be ""5 Ways to Feel More Powerful."" But as things stand, many people feel powerless, and the social trends that drain personal power only grow stronger. Whether you struggle due to the recession, a controlling spouse, or the anonymity of routine work, it's crucial to find a way to limit that feeling in your day-to-day life. Before talking about power, let's clarify what power isn't. It isn't a force that you use like a weapon to get your own way. It isn't a suppression of what you don't like about yourself to achieve a perfect ideal that doesn't exist in the first place. It isn't money, status, possessions, or any other material surrogate. There are countless people sitting in the lap of luxury who feel even more powerless than the average person does. This is so because the issues of power are all ""in here,"" where you relate to yourself. Now we can address the five things that help conquer that feeling of powerlessness. Oprah.com: The 4-step plan to get your life on track . 1. Stop giving away your power. Becoming powerless doesn't happen in a single dramatic stroke, like the barbarian hordes breaking down your door and burning your house. It's a process, and for most people, the process is so gradual that they don't notice it. They are more than happy, in fact, to give away their power by degrees. Why? Because being powerless seems like an easy way to be popular, accepted, and protected. Thus you are giving away your power when you please others in order to fit in. Or when you follow the opinions of the crowd. Or when you decide that others matter more than you do. Or when you let someone who seems to have more power take charge of you. It can often seem right -- or proper -- o sit modestly in the background, holding accepted opinions, living for your children, or letting a controlling spouse run roughshod over you in order to keep the peace. In small and large ways, however, these kinds of decisions reduce your sense of self-worth, and without self-worth, you cannot rid yourself of your powerlessness. 2. Examine why it's ""good"" to be a victim. Once you start chipping away at your self-worth, it's a short step to becoming a victim. I define being a victim as engaging in ""selfless pain."" In other words, by telling yourself that you don't really count, you can make the suffering you endure into a kind of virtue, as all martyrs do. It's ""good"" when you serve a higher spiritual purpose -- or so some religion suggest but what if there is no higher purpose? Most victims feel good about worrying all the time, but worry makes you far more vulnerable to bad things in general, since worry is so all-consuming that the mind isn't free and alert enough to tell real threats from imaginary ones. Worry feels like a protection -- when it is exactly the opposite. Victims find lots of other ""good"" reasons for their plight. They are forgiving of an abusive spouse, because forgiveness is considered spiritual. They enable an addict, because tolerance and acceptance of others is equally spiritual. But if you stand back, you'll see that victims in such situations are deliberately bringing suffering upon themselves, which not only confirms their powerlessness, it encourages it to grow and grow. The victim is always being acted upon. There are enough abusers, addicts, rage-aholics, control freaks, and petty tyrants out there to drain the power from anyone who volunteers to play the role of victim. Having given away too much of themselves, the first step for victims is to realize that their role is voluntary. They are not trapped by fate, destiny, or the will of God. Their role is a personal choice, and they can chose differently. Unleash the Magnificent, Unstoppable Energy Inside You . Oprah.com: How to unleash the magnificent, unstoppable energy inside you . 3. Develop your core self. Human beings are the only creatures who do not mature automatically. A baby chick has no choice but to turn into a chicken. But the world is full of people stuck in childhood and adolescence, no matter how old they happen to be. For us, to mature is a decision: Adulthood is an achievement, one that requires -- and results in -- personal power. This can takes decades, but it starts with a vision of the ""core self."" This is the part of you that connects to reality, placing you at the center of experiences that you personally create. To have a core self is to be the author of your own story; it is the exact opposite of being a victim, who must live a life authored by others. Oprah.com: 4 steps to a more meaningful life . 4. Align yourself with the flow of evolution, or personal growth. Once you establish your core self as a goal, your path will unfold and you will evolve. This evolution is wobbly at first; everyone has at least some elements of ignorance and immaturity. But'Â 'thanks to free will, you can help guide your own evolution. The simple fact is that we all desire more and better things for ourselves. If those more and better things are good for our growth, then we are guiding our own positive and powerful evolution. In India they make a distinction between dharma and adharma. Dharma includes whatever naturally upholds life: happiness, truth, duty, virtue, wonder, worship, reverence, appreciation, nonviolence, love, self-respect. On the other hand, adharma consists of choices that do not support life naturally: anger, violence, fear, control, dogmatism, skepticism, unvirtuous acts, prejudice, addiction, intolerance, and unconsciousness in general. For our purposes, dharma is the ultimate power. It easily supports you, a single individual. What is asked of you is that you honestly look at your everyday life and the choices you are making. Ask yourself how to increase the dharmic choices and decrease the adharmic ones. 5. Trust in a power that transcends everyday reality. Nothing described so far will come true without a higher reality. For the moment, let's leave aside religion and any reference to God. Fortunately, to have even a speck of consciousness is to be connected to the finite consciousness that supports life, evolution, creativity, and intelligence. None of these things are accidental or a privilege handed out to the lucky few. To use a metaphor, imagine that you are caught in a net. All nets have holes, so find one, and jump through it. I've known wives of abusive husbands who found a hole through, say, learning to paint. For them, it was an escape route, and as they made art, their thinking changed from ""I am trapped and can do nothing"" to ""I must be worth more than I imagined, because look at this beautiful thing I created."" Escape routes exist along the qualities hidden in consciousness. They include: . Creativity. Go beyond by discovery and exploration. This leads to insight. Your inner vision clears. You start to see glimmers of light through the fog of your situation. Something more beautiful starts to attract you, and you want to go toward it. Intelligence. Let your mind lead the way. You start having newer, more exciting thoughts than the old habitual ones you've been following. Beliefs are challenged. New points of view attract you, so you move toward them. You'll want to expand your mind in place of living behind defenses and boundaries. Love and compassion. Discover that you can forgive yourself and others. Fantasies of hurt and revenge are replaced with emotional softening. You see that there is untapped love around you, so you move toward it. The fact that you desire to love and be loved starts to motivate you, without excuses about being unworthy. Quantum leaps. Notice -- and learn -- when you have an epiphany, a moment of dramatic awakening. These are the great ""aha"" experiences that peel away an entire layer of reality. We say that the heavens open, but really it's a new level of consciousness, one that brings more light. Devotion. Understand that life is full of awe and wonder. From this you see a reason to revere your own existence. You have been placed in a world where you can be devoted to something, and your worship gives you a sense of worth. Oprah.com: How to embrace the present moment . These escape routes all lead back to the person you really are, and that person know that what really counts extends far beyond the individual: the glory of creation, the beauty of nature, the heart qualities of love and compassion, the mental power to discover new things, and those unexpected epiphanies that bring the presence of God -- these universal aspects are your true source of power.

"(CNN) -- As the cold, hard reality of the holiday shopping season dawns in earnest, literally millions of shoppers will be considering video-game consoles when they hit the stores (or stay warm shopping online) this week. Whether on the hunt for yourself or, more likely, looking for a gift for a friend or family member, the decision isn't an easy one. Both Sony's PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox One hit stores in the past week or so, and both are off to huge starts. Each sold more than 1 million units in their first 24 hours. Nintendo -- the third player in console gaming's Big Three -- has its year-old ""next generation"" console, the Wii U, to consider as well. To be sure, there are lots of factors to consider when making a choice. But if you're trying to decide which box should end up under the tree, take a look at some thoughts what we see as a big advantage for each console. You'll want a PlayStation 4 if ... you want a solid social gaming machine offering intricate, beautiful games that players can share easily with friends. The next generation of consoles has more power than its predecessors, so games look more robust and offer expanded environments of play and more intricate detail. In ""Knack,"" the PS4's power is on display when hundreds of tiny relics form in a mystical creature with animation that's near-Pixar quality. The DualShock 4 controller contains new features that work very well for some games. The touchpad offers a new way to interface with gameplay. In ""Killzone: Shadow Fall,"" a swipe across the pad activates different features for your robotic companion. A social sharing button directly on the controller allows players to let others see their accomplishments. Video clips, screenshots and direct broadcasts are available through Facebook, Twitter, Twitch and Ustream right out of the box. It also should be mentioned that at $399, the PS4 is $100 cheaper than the rival Xbox One. When disc games are $60 and download games run $15, the money saved could be used to get the content you want. You'll want an Xbox One if ... you are in the market for a multimedia machine that can multitask and switch between games, movies, music and applications quickly and seamlessly. Easily the best thing about the X1 (so far) is how quickly the new interface switches from one application to another with just a voice command (via an improved Kinect). The hands-free controller not only works for games, it changes the channels on your TV, serves up movie content or uses the Snap function to do two things at once. Snap allows for split-screen multitasking on the fly. Say you are watching the local NFL game through the X1, but you want to know how your fantasy football team is doing. Snap brings up a Web browser in a side window to let you access your online team without missing a handoff in the game you're watching. And it is all done with voice command through Kinect. It can recognize six voices and learns the games, shows and apps that each of those people likes. Of course, it also can create a new power struggle for the remote control as opposing viewers scream instructions to the console. The X1, which costs $499, has an amazing suite of entertainment choices with partners like Hulu Plus, Netflix, YouTube and more. Microsoft wants to offer people as many television, movie and music choices as possible, and content providers are signing up. You'll want a Wii U if ... you want a wider selection of games to play now and at a price that won't blow away your entire holiday budget. Lest we forget, the Nintendo Wii U is also a next-generation gaming console. It has the advantage of having been on the market for more than a year. Developers have used that time to produce quality games for all age groups. Titles like ""Super Mario 3D World,"" ""Pikmin 3"" and ""The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker HD"" -- along with Wii U versions of many highly sought-after third-party titles -- make the console more attractive compared with the limited number of titles available on the new PlayStation and Xbox. And the Wii U is backward-compatible, meaning any Wii controllers or games you owned before upgrading to the next-gen box still work on the Wii U. The other next-gen consoles won't let you play your older games and require new controllers to use them. And this might be a big factor for some: Nintendo recently cut the price of the Wii U to $299, making it $100 less than the PS4 and $200 less than the X1. For what's been promoted as as a family-friendly console, that price difference could be important as holiday spending gets tighter. Plus, the extra money can be used to buy games.","Console gamers have lots of choices this holiday season .
The PlayStation 4 has dynamic graphics, improved controllers and middle-of-pack pricing .
Xbox One is an entertainment hub with a smooth interface .
Wii U is most affordable and has a year's worth of games to choose from ."
"(CNN) -- Is there anything Jennifer Lawrence can't do? Actually, yes: She's not the best when it comes to singing. The Oscar winner admitted to David Letterman on his ""Late Show"" on Wednesday that she has a huge fear of singing in front of other people, and it all goes back to the time she sang a holiday song in front of her school as an 8-year-old. ""I do not like singing in front of other people,"" Lawrence told Letterman. ""I'm like, scarred from my childhood, because I had a mother who would tell me that I was amazing at everything and that I can do everything, but I can't. So I sang in front of the school, because it was like, 'I can do that! I can do anything!' "" Lawrence claims that she has this ""tone-deaf Amy Winehouse voice,"" but when she broke into a rendition of ""Have a Holly Jolly Christmas,"" which is the song she performed way back when, Winehouse is definitely not who we were reminded of. Lawrence actually had to face her fear of singing for the latest ""Hunger Games"" movie, ""Mockingjay -- Part I,"" because she had to perform a song called ""The Hanging Tree."" She still hasn't heard her performance in the movie, but she knows that moviegoers will. ""Everybody's told me that it's me,"" she said, ""because I was like, 'will you guys please get Lorde to really sing it?' And they said no, it's really your voice."" We'll find out how she sounds when ""Mockingjay -- Part I"" opens November 21, but we can already bet it'll be better than her take on Christmas carols.","Jennifer Lawrence butchered Christmas carols on David Letterman's show .

"(CNN) -- ""Eaten Alive""? Not quite. Herpetologist Paul Rosolie generated lots of hype ahead of his attempt during a Discovery Channel special to be eaten whole by a giant green anaconda, the largest and most powerful snake in the world. To many viewers' disappointment, Rosolie was constricted by the snake but never consumed. ""Ultimately, after the snake constricted Paul for over an hour and went for his head, the experiment had to be called when it became clear that Paul would be very seriously injured if he continued on. The safety of Paul, as well as the anaconda, was always our number one priority,"" Discovery said in a statement. Viewers ultimately recoiled at the special after it aired Sunday and took to social media to blast the network for overselling the program's title. ""Awful. No way that snake could have eaten someone his size. I was just hoping it could squeeze him to death at least but no such luck. Sorry to say I cheered for the snake, but frankly it had 10X more charisma than those lame excuses for humans had,"" said one CNN commenter. Rosolie presented himself as prey to the snake after putting on a special reinforced suit with helmet and devices to measure his vital signs, he said before the show aired in a news release on the Discovery Channel website. Before the special, Rosolie claimed that he spent an hour inside the snake, which was difficult because he's claustrophobic. ""She got me right in the face,"" Rosolie said. ""The last thing I saw was her mouth wide open before everything went black. As this happened, she wrapped around me and took me off of my feet. I felt the suit cracking. It felt as if my arms were ripping out of their sockets."" Rosolie didn't say much more about his experience in the western Amazon, which was filmed in advance, because he wanted everybody to tune in. Some CNN.com commenters were left hungry for more substance after watching. ""The last 30 minutes of the program shows him wrestling with the snake then trying to get but never getting eaten -- all of this is punctuated by overproduction (i.e., loud music, short scenes and shots cut together like an action movie, etc.) to add drama where there really is none. When all is said and done, I've been swallowed by as many anacondas as he has,"" wrote one viewer. The Discovery Channel said that it was Rosolie's ""absolute intention to be eaten alive"" but that his and the snake's well-being were of the utmost importance. Some animal rights organizations complained, but Rosolie says the snake came out fine. ""I would not have done this if there were any real chance of hurting or stressing out the snake,"" he said. Next, he wants to find the biggest anaconda. ""During an earlier expedition in the Amazon, we encountered a 26-foot-long anaconda that weighed hundreds of pounds,"" he said. ""The snake for the 'Eaten Alive' project was big, about 18 feet long, but we know that there are even larger anacondas out there."" CNN's Sarah LeTrent contributed to this report.","NEW: Viewers say the special was overhyped; herpetologist was not eaten alive .

"Kyrgyzstan (CNN) -- Headless goats. Soaring eagles. Men trying to drag each other off of horses. These were just some of the highlights of last week's first-ever World Nomad Games, held near the shores of Lake Issyk-Kul in Cholpon-Ata City, Kyrgyzstan. About 400 athletes came from 19 countries -- mostly Central Asia, as well as Turkey, Mongolia and even Germany and the United States. The games were sponsored by the Kyrgyzstan government. A temporary camp with 150 yurts was set up in Kyrchyn Jailoo to host guests. In addition to traditional competitions such as wrestling and kok boru (in which two teams of horsemen try to push a headless goat carcass into a goal), performances and folk games kept crowds active. An official at the opening ceremony rang in the games by declaring: ""All humans were originally nomads."" As nomadic peoples have become minorities in modern societies, the six-day games were organized to showcase vanishing traditions and culture. ""[Nomadic sports] are in no way inferior in staginess and popularity [to] the modern Olympics,"" says the games' official website.

"(CNN) -- As public protests against the Mubarak regime spread from Cairo to New York City, Egyptian-American activists on Friday called on the Obama adminstration to back the ""Lotus Revolution"" to oust the authoritarian ruler. They also called on President Hosni Mubarak's government to end its purported practices of detentions, torture and ""extrajudicial killings."" ""This day, I assure you, will be mentioned in history as a point of change all over the Middle East, said Mokhtar Kamel. ""Gone are the old days where antiquated brutal regimes are controlling the area."" ""To those in the United States and in the West who are quoting stability as an excuse for brutality. Guys, this is too late,"" Kamel said. ""You have to change your mentality."" Kamel, vice president of the Coalition of Egyptian Organizations in North America, was one of several Egyptian-American activists to appear at the National Press Club in Washington Friday to talk about the protests. The press club event coincided with planned protests against the Mubarak regime in New York; Jersey City, New Jersey; and Washington. Kamel and others spoke with alarm and excitement over the protests taking place in their home country. They blasted the Egyptian government for using violence to suppress the demonstrations. They accused pro-goverment ""thugs"" of setting fire to cars and blaming the acts on protesters. Dina Guirguis, an Egyptian-American and a fellow with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told reporters that Egypt is currently under a ""communication blackout."" ""Internet service has been shut off completely since last night and mobile phone service as well,"" Guirguis said. ""So many of us here have relatives back home, including myself. I have no idea where my brother is."" Samia Harris, a founder of the Alliance of Egyptian Americans (AEA), appealed directly to top U.S. officials to change course in their response to the Egyptian crisis. ""Mr. Obama,"" Harris said, ""please, please stand on the right side of history. Stand by the Egyptian people."" To Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Harris said, ""Mrs. Clinton, we know you are a good mom, there are a lot of girls, Egyptian girls in the street that are being beaten right now ... Mrs. Clinton, take your place in history and do what you can to stop the violence in Egypt."" Harris and other speakers hailed their former countrymen for their uncharacteristic bravery in taking to the streets to protest the Mubarak regime. ""For a long time, the Egyptian people were silent by fear. They were afraid,"" said Ibrahim Hussein, vice president of the mid-Atlantic chapter of AEA. ""In the past three days this jail of fear in the Egyptian psyche has been broken and people are free to speak and to demonstrate."" Saad Eddin Ibrahim, a leading Egyptian human rights activist who was imprisoned for his criticism of Mubarak, called the protests taking place in his home country the ""Lotus Revoluton."" ""The lotus is the flower that was highly appreciated by ancient Egyptians,"" said Ibrahim. ""I'd like to salute our people. I'd like to pay tribute to all Egyptians fallen under the guns of Mubarak."" Ibrahim said Mubarak has ""successfully duped Western governments as being the bulwark against terrorism, against extremism and the bulwark for peace."" ""Mubarak in 30 years,"" said Ibrahim, ""did not advance the peace one inch.""","Egyptian-American activists call on President Barack Obama to ""stand on the right side of history""

"(CNN) -- If your passport is gathering dust and your suitcase desperately needs a workout, don't throw away thoughts of a thrilling vacation just because your wallet doesn't match your wanderlust. Supply and demand dictate pricing in nearly every industry, and travel is no exception. When things are less than perfect, they cost less. So Europe is cheaper in the fall, when the weather can be sketchy and the landscape isn't quite as alluring. When school's in session, it's a challenge to take the kids out of class, but your Disney vacation will be a lot less expensive. In addition to costing less, these trips have other perks: A theme park with fewer crowds means that your kids are more likely to get some face time with Mickey and Cinderella. And if you opt for Europe right after Thanksgiving, you'll be there during prime time for the Christmas markets. Here are five times when bargain-hungry globetrotters can get their fill: . Need a deal now? Head for the ocean. If you want to take advantage of the cheapest time to be afloat, you should be reading this from your cabin aboard a cruise ship. October and pre-Thanksgiving November is the time when you can sail through the Caribbean on a last-minute deal that's oh-so-easy on the wallet. It's the fringe of hurricane season (officially, it's June 1st - November 30th) but remember that cruise ships can alter their routes when a storm hits, whereas a resort cannot move from the path of danger. ""The itinerary might change slightly, but you still get your cruise,"" said Chris McGinnis, director of Travel Skills Group. ""The best time to be on vacation in the Caribbean is actually when there's a hurricane someplace else in the region, because if you're not in the path, the storm sucks all the bad stuff out of the way and you're left with perfectly gorgeous weather."" And even though many people book cruise vacations during the first three months of the year (known as ""wave season""), seaworthy travelers looking for a deal should hold off in order to scoop up last-minute savings, McGinnis said. ""As long as you don't have your heart set on a specific destination or specific ship, there is sure to be a plethora of great last-minute deals."" Just be sure to purchase travel insurance if you're heading to Mexico or the Caribbean in the fall, just in case of bad weather. Go between the expensive holiday travel periods. One of the cheapest times to pack your bags is just around the corner: It starts about the same time the final leftovers from Thanksgiving are gobbled up and lasts until just before the airports fill up with Christmas travelers. ""We always recommend the three weeks after Thanksgiving,"" said Travel Leaders travel agent Kristy Osborn. ""The airports are not crowded, the cruise ships are not full of holiday travelers, and there are no hurricanes."" McGinnis concurs. ""The cheapest time to travel, to pretty much anywhere, falls between the two most expensive travel times. The only exception to that rule is New York City because everyone wants to go shopping then,"" said McGinnis. You may think ""Disney"" and ""deal"" don't go together, but if you can finagle a way to get there when school is in session, you'll reap the financial benefits. If your children have unexpected time off from school, or the academic calendar shifts for some reason, that's the time to book your Disney trip. If your kids are pre-school age or you can take their studies with you, those weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas offer the same Disney magic, for much less. These same rules apply between New Year's Day and spring break. Enjoy the white stuff without spending so much green stuff. The end of ski season in the spring is the time to enjoy the slopes without splurging. ""There are world-class hotels in famously pricey ski destinations offering amazing deals,"" said Jaime Freedman, a deals specialist at Travelzoo. It happens at the beginning of the season too for domestic and international ski meccas, and Freedman said Canada is one place to find some frosty deals. ""Mont-Tremblant and Whistler, for example, have great deals a few weeks prior to ski season and then again at the tail end once the weather warms up."" Turn up the heat, turn down the price in ""hot"" cities. If you've always wanted to see Las Vegas but need a sure bet on low pricing, visit Sin City in July and August when hotels are clamoring for guests. ""Don't let 115 degrees on the thermometer scare you,"" said SRI Travel & Promotion owner Renee Werbin, who points out that ""Everything is air conditioned and you can take trams between hotels."" Miami is also a good bet for cheap travel in the summertime, and the traditionally hot and humid summers of New Orleans mean you can also find some fabulous deals in the Big Easy. Winter is easy on the wallet and full of options. There may be a gray sky behind the Eiffel Tower or Big Ben when you take your vacation photos, but that's nothing a little photo editing can't fix. Nothing beats Europe in the fall and winter if you want more bang for your buck. ""Common sense is always your guide. Travel to Europe in the winter months and stay in deluxe accommodations that would cost substantially more in spring and summer seasons,"" said Werbin. A Canadian (non-ski) holiday is also something to consider if you can handle the cold temperatures that usually freeze the prices at lower-than-normal numbers. And if you're looking for something exotic, Asia is usually on sale as well. ""Asian prices always drop during winter months; even Tokyo can be a bargain prospect in January and February,"" said Travelzoo Senior Editor Gabe Saglie. Of course there's an exception to the winter discounts: unless you're extremely flexible, it's usually hard to find a deal between Christmas and New Year's Eve. You'll also be hard-pressed to find a safari on a clearance rack, but if you want to do it for the lowest price possible, go during the hotter, rainier season in southern and central Africa between November and February. But keep in mind that there's a school holiday in December, so November, January and February are the best bets. ""Our winter time is hot, hot, hot down in South Africa, which is when you'll see some savings,"" said Freedman. Werbin said she reminds her clients, ""Animals are never on vacation.""","Traveling on the cheap means going against the crowds .
The weeks right after Thanksgiving, and before Christmas, offer great discounts .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court upheld President Barack Obama's sweeping health care legislation Thursday in a narrow 5-4 ruling that Obama says will provide up to 30 million additional Americans with health care. America doesn't have universal health care coverage -- what the World Health Organization (WHO) calls ""a widely shared political aim of most countries"" -- but neither do most other countries. Nearly 50 countries have attained universal or near-universal health coverage by 2008, according to the International Labor Organization. Several well-known examples exist like the UK, which has the National Health Service, and the Canadian public health care system. Here are more examples of countries have implemented near-universal health care. Brazil . Free health care coverage is recognized as a citizen's right in Brazil. Brazilians have both a private and public health care system, which was overhauled in 1988. The Sistema Ãšnico de SaÃºde, a nationalized program, provides primary health care, while a network of public and contracted hospitals delivers specialist care. About 80 percent of Brazil's population relies on public care, while the wealthiest 20% can afford private health care, according to a Center for Strategic and International Studies report. Since the 1990s, Brazil has also provided universal access to HIV/AIDS drugs. During the three decades since the nation's major health care changes, infant mortality decreased and life expectancy increased by 10.6 years, according to a 2011 article in medical journal The Lancet. But the system hasn't been without problems, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies report, which alluded to gaps in the quality of care between various Brazilian regions. Rwanda . Since establishing a national health plan in 1999, Rwanda has insured about 91% of its population with health care -- a greater percentage than the United States. Rwanda has been dubbed ""Africa's Singapore"" by The Economist for its transformation since a devastating genocide in 1994. Watch Fareed Zakaria talk with Rwanda's president . The country has three health insurance plans, one for government employees, another for the military, and the third for the remaining population. The country commits about 20% of its annual spending to health, which is funded by tax revenues, insurance premiums and financial support from international donations, according to a WHO report. Since introducing health insurance, Rwanda has seen lower childhood mortality rates; more people are also receiving medical attention. But the country faces challenges from an increase in health services and making contributions more affordable for its poorest citizens, according to a WHO report. Thailand . By law, Thailand requires all patients to be covered by health insurance, regardless of their ability to pay. The WHO uses Thailand as an example of a low- or middle-income country that has been able to extend health coverage to all citizens. Introduced in 2002 as the ""30-bhat scheme,"" (which is less than $1), the plan added about 14 million previously uninsured people to the Thai system. Prescription drugs, hospitalizations and services like chemotherapy, surgery and emergency care are free to patients, according to a WHO report. But the addition of millions of people to a health care system strained the existing structures, prompting criticisms of long waits, poor quality of service and shortage of service. South Korea . South Korea passed a law in 1977, mandating health insurance for industrial workers. During its rapid economic growth, health care became a priority for the government, which created the National Health Insurance. The system extended to universal coverage by 1989. The government merged more than 300 individual insurers into a single national fund, according to a WHO report. Korea's single-payer program has ""been successful in mobilizing resources for health care, rapidly extending population coverage, effectively pooling public and private resources to purchase health care for the entire population, and containing health care expenditure,"" according to a report published in Health Policy Plan. But another report published in Health Affairs said that the public funding is limited, leaving ""beneficiaries with relatively high payments."" South Korea's expenditure on health care is 6.3% of the country's gross domestic product, compared with 18% in the United States. Moldova . The Eastern European country became independent with the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. By 2004, it began a mandatory health insurance program with the aim of providing the entire population with basic health care. Employed Moldovans chip in a portion of their income through a payroll tax or a flat-rate contribution. Others who are unemployed or not working are insured by the government. Its National Health Insurance Company is the sole buyer of health care services and organizes emergency, primary and secondary care locally, according to a report by the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, a joint partnership between European governments and the World Health Organization. Kuwait . Kuwait's level of health care is comparable to average European standards, according to the WHO's profile of the Middle Eastern country. The country began building up its health care system as it gained wealth from oil revenues. By the 1950s, the government implemented free comprehensive health care. This resulted in declines in general mortality and infant deaths, the report said. ""Free health care was so extensive that it even included veterinary medicine,"" according to a local WHO report. Kuwait faces an aging population as well as an epidemic of diabetes, heart disease and obesity-related complications that place great demands on its health care system. Chile . The Chilean constitution guarantees rights to health protection. Chileans can opt for public care or get coverage from private health insurance companies. Wealthier citizens can buy insurance from the Instituciones de Salud Previsional or obtain coverage through their employer. A 7% income tax funds the public health care system, the Fondo Nacional de Salud, according to an analysis of health care reform in Chile. Public care includes free medical, dental and midwifery services, which are run locally. Private insurance tends to focus on specialist treatment. The existence of both public-private insurance has created inequities of care, prompting reform efforts in 2000 to increase equality across the country. Chile has guaranteed universal access to quality treatment for some conditions including certain cancers, HIV/AIDS, pneumonia, depression and dental care, which has improved care for the poor, according to the WHO. China . China announced an overhaul of its health system in 2009 to bring safe, affordable basic health services to all residents -- a tall order for a country containing 1.3 billion people. The government committed about $126 billion to reform the quality and efficiency of its health care, and ensure affordable and quality medication. But the issue of equity in health care persists. ""There are still significant disparities in health status between regions, urban and rural areas, and among population groups,"" according to the WHO. China has seen increased life expectancy and reductions in infant deaths, but health observers stated in the WHO report the need to improve delivery of care.","Universal health coverage prevalent in Europe and several non-Western nations .

"(CNN) -- U.S. military forces conducted an operation Monday against the Al-Shabaab network in Somalia, Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said. ""We are assessing the results of the operation and will provide additional information as and when appropriate,"" he said. No other information was immediately available. The Pentagon did not say who was targeted, where in Somalia the operation took place nor why the operation was happening now. But the governor of Somalia's Lower Shabelle region said a suspected drone strike hit a small rebel-held village between the towns of Dhaab Tubaako and Haaway. Gov. Abdikadir Mohamed Nur Sidii added that attack appeared to target an Al-Shabaab camp where top leaders of the group have been holding a meeting to discuss an ongoing joint offensive by Somali and AU troops against their strongholds in the country's south. He said those targeted appeared to include the leader of the Al-Shabaab militants, Ahmed Godane, but it was not clear whether he was injured or not. Godane has been a driving force behind Al-Shabaab declaring its affiliation to al Qaeda and has pressed for the group to launch attacks beyond Somalia. The United States designated Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked militant group, as a foreign terrorist organization in March 2008. It has targeted Al-Shabaab leaders in Somalia at least twice in the past year. Also Monday, the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) announced that military forces had liberated several important towns from the terrorists' grip, in the Middle Shabelle and Hiiran regions . ""The Somali National Army supported by AMISOM forces have faced little resistance from their advancement as al-Shabaab simply melted away when they heard the aligned forces are approaching,"" the mission said in a written statement. The developments come just one day after Al-Shabaab fighters dressed in government military uniforms approached the gate of a high security prison in Mogadishu, set off a car bomb and fired their way into the building. During the assault on the National Intelligence and Security Agency prison, three security guards and two civilians were killed and 15 others were injured, Security Ministry spokesman Mohamed Yusuf told CNN. The NISA prison is underground and is close to the Somali presidential palace in Mogadishu. Hundreds of inmates, mostly Al-Shabaab members, are being held there. Al-Shabaab hopes to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state and has launched attacks in other countries as well. The group claimed responsibility for the siege of the Westgate mall in Nairobi last September 21 that killed at least 67 people. CNN's Susanna Capelouto and Nana Karikari-apau contributed to this report.","NEW: A Somali governor reports a suspected drone strike apparently targeting Godane .

"(CNN) -- He was loved and admired the world over, profiled in books and movies, and showered with awards and accolades. But even the most public of personalities have little-known facts buried in their biographies. Here are 10 surprising facts you probably didn't know about Nelson Mandela: . 1. He lived up to his name: Mandela's birth name was Rolihlahla. In his Xhosa tribe, the name means pulling the branch of a tree or troublemaker. (The name ""Nelson"" was given to him by his teacher on his first day of elementary school. It's not clear why she chose that particular name. It was the 1920s, and African children were given English names so colonial masters could pronounce them easily). 2. He had a cameo in a Spike Lee film: He had a big part in Spike Lee's 1992 biopic ""Malcolm X."" At the very end of the movie, he plays a teacher reciting Malcolm X's famous speech to a room full of Soweto school kids. But the pacifist Mandela wouldn't say ""by any means necessary."" So Lee cut back to footage of Malcolm X to close out the film. 3. There's a woodpecker named after him: From Cape Town to California, streets named after Mandela abound. But he's also been the subject of some rather unusual tributes. Last year, scientists named a prehistoric woodpecker after him: Australopicus nelsonmandelai. In 1973, the physics institute at Leeds University named a nuclear particle the 'Mandela particle.' 4. He married a first lady: Before tying the knot with Mandela on his 80th birthday, Graca Machel was married to Mozambique President Samora Machel. Her marriage to Mandela after her husband's death means she has been the first lady of two nations. 5. He was a master of disguise: When Mandela was eluding authorities during his fight against apartheid, he disguised himself in various ways, including as a chauffeur. The press nicknamed him ""the Black Pimpernel"" because of his police evasion tactics. ""I became a creature of the night. I would keep to my hideout during the day, and would emerge to do my work when it became dark,"" he says in his biography, ""Long Walk to Freedom."" 6. A bloody sport intrigued him: Besides politics, Mandela's other passion was boxing. ""I did not like the violence of boxing. I was more interested in the science of it - how you move your body to protect yourself, how you use a plan to attack and retreat, and how you pace yourself through a fight,"" he says in his biography. 7. His favorite dish is probably not yours: He's been wined and dined by world leaders. But what Mandela loved eating most was tripe. Yup, the stomach lining of farm animals. 8. He quit his day job: He studied law at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg and opened the nation's first black law firm in the city in 1952. 9. He was on the U.S. terror watch list: Mandela wasn't removed from the U.S. terror watch list until 2008 -- at age 89. He and other members of the African National Congress were placed on it because of their militant fight against apartheid. 10. He drew his inspiration from a poem: While he was in prison, Mandela would read William Ernest Henley's ""Invictus"" to fellow prisoners. The poem, about never giving up, resonated with Mandela for its lines ""I am the master of my fate. I am the captain of my soul."" You may know it from the movie by the same name starring Morgan Freeman as Mandela.","He had a cameo in a Spike Lee film .

"(CNN) -- The biggest story in Baltimore Tuesday happened inside the headquarters of the city's ABC-affiliated station, WMAR, but for more than five hours, the station's reporters couldn't get on the air to cover it. The station was evacuated around 11:45 a.m. after an unidentified man smashed a truck through the lobby and screamed that he was God. Police began an hours-long search of the building to find him. He was apprehended shortly after 4:30 p.m. All the while, WMAR journalists could relay information only via Twitter and the station's website. By mid-afternoon, a makeshift newsroom had been set up about a mile north of the station -- but the reporters still had no way to broadcast. WMAR, known as Channel 2 locally, was broadcasting regularly scheduled, taped shows at the time of the intrusion. It continued to run on a television version of auto-pilot all afternoon (""The People's Court,"" ""General Hospital,"" etc.) while two of its rivals, WJZ and WBAL, covered the breaking news story nonstop. Competitive tendencies abated for at least a few hours: WMAR staffers who witnessed the crash gave interviews to the other stations, and WMAR's website streamed a simulcast of WJZ's live coverage. Station officials said on Twitter that every staff member had been accounted for. Initially the staffers waited outside at a safe distance from the station headquarters; around 2:30 p.m., a yellow school bus arrived to take some of them to a Marriott hotel in Towson, Maryland, where they regrouped and began to plan news coverage for the rest of the day. Other staffers stayed on the scene to gather information. Without access to the airwaves, ""they're using social media to get out their message,"" WJZ reporter Derek Valcourt told viewers. At 4 p.m., the auto-pilot ceased, and the station's signal went to black. But WMAR, which is owned by The E.W. Scripps Company, worked with its sister station KNXV in Phoenix to re-establish a signal. ""Our awesome engineers are fighting like hell to get us back on-air from off-site,"" WMAR investigative and general assignment reporter Brian Kuebler wrote on Twitter at 3 p.m. Around the same time that local officials held a news conference to announce the suspect's apprehension, WMAR was able to stream its own live coverage to its website. During the 5 p.m. hour, that coverage also started to appear over the airwaves. It was raw at first -- just one live, handheld camera and one anchor, Jamie Costello, who interviewed his colleagues about what they'd seen. ""Right now we are using our Phoenix station to bring you this signal,"" Costello told viewers. ""Forgive us for the sloppiness."" After the police news conference, staffers were allowed to come back on the station's property but could not enter the building. Mike Masco, one of the station's meteorologists, said on Twitter that the staff would be allowed back in the building at 7 p.m. On the lawn outside, an impromptu news planning meeting took place while Costello narrated the scene. ""We're going to have news tonight,"" he said.","NEW: WMAR returns to the airwaves with help from Phoenix sister station .

"Jacksonville, Florida (CNN) -- Jurors found Michael Dunn guilty of first-degree murder Wednesday in the 2012 shooting death of 17-year-old Jordan Davis. Dunn's parents were in the courtroom for the verdict. Davis' parents, Ron Davis and Lucia MacBath, both let out a quiet gasp upon hearing the jury forewoman's words and then hung their heads and cried. Dunn did not appear to have an immediate reaction, but later, he turned around and somberly shook his head toward his father. Dunn, 47, was charged with murder after shooting into an SUV full of teenagers at a Jacksonville, Florida, gas station following a squabble over the music emanating from the teens' vehicle. Outside the courtroom, Davis' mother expressed her gratitude for a verdict she said represented justice not only for her son but for ""Trayvon and for all the nameless faces and children and people that will never have a voice."" She was referring to Trayvon Martin, an unarmed teenager killed earlier the same year by a neighborhood watch captain who was acquitted in the death. ""Words cannot express our joy but also our great sorrow because ... we know that Jordan has received his justice,"" she said. ""We know that Jordan's life and legacy will live on for others, but at the same time, we're very saddened by the life that Michael Dunn will continue to live. We are saddened for his family, for his friends and the community that will continue to suffer by his actions."" The victim's father said the verdict made Jacksonville ""a shining example that you could have a jury made of mostly white people, white men,"" that delivers justice in a racially charged case. ""Hopefully,"" Davis said, ""this is a start where we don't have to look at the makeup of a jury anymore."" Prosecutor Angela Corey said Dunn faces a life term along with a minimum of 25 to life for using a firearm. ""It's a vindication for justice,"" she said of the verdict. ""We believe that we have to have as much justice as we can to assure that Michael Dunn will never ever walk out of a prison."" Duval County Judge Russell Healey set a tentative sentencing hearing for October 17 but said he would wait until Tuesday to ensure the date worked for Dunn's defense attorneys. ""This has been going on for two years, and everyone has acted graciously. I ask that you continue to do that,"" Healey said before the verdict was read. ""Remember, we must respect the verdict of the jury. They did not volunteer to do this."" Dunn has said he shot at the vehicle because he thought Davis had a weapon and feared for his life, but the prosecution has alleged Dunn was the aggressor and pointed out he kept firing even after the teens fled. Three of the 10 shots that Dunn fired struck Davis, one of them cutting through his liver, a lung and his aorta. Investigators say Davis never had a weapon, nor was one found in the teens' SUV or the surrounding area. A jury found Dunn guilty of four charges in February, commanding at least 60 years in prison, but the jury was hung on the murder charge related to Davis' November 2012 death. Jurors began deliberating on the new charges just before 10 a.m. ET on Wednesday, after Healey dismissed two of the three alternates and provided instructions for the charges jurors were to consider. The first charge to consider, Healey said, was first-degree murder, which would require that Dunn premeditated killing Davis. If the jury didn't feel the state proved first-degree murder, it was instructed to move on to second-degree, which would mean Dunn killed Davis via a criminal or depraved act. The third charge was manslaughter, which would require a finding that Dunn unlawfully caused Davis' death. Juror: 'Race was never a factor' Killing Davis was lawful, Healey told the jury, if Dunn acted in the heat of passion or if he unintentionally caused Davis' death. The jury could also find Dunn not guilty if he was in danger, acted in self-defense and exacted a justifiable use of force, the judge instructed. Dunn was convicted in February on one count of shooting into a vehicle and three counts of attempted second-degree murder -- one each for Davis' friends, Leland Brunson, Tommie Stornes and Tevin Thompson, who were in the Dodge Durango with Davis that day. Juror: 'I believed he was guilty' The Satellite Beach, Florida, man hasn't been sentenced on those charges, but prosecutor Eric Wolfson said at the time of the conviction that each attempted second-degree murder charge carries a minimum sentence of at least 20 years. There's also a 15-year sentence possible on the conviction for shooting at the teenager's vehicle, Wolfson said. CNN's Ray Sanchez contributed to this story.","Michael Dunn found guilty of murder in 2012 shooting death of Jordan Davis, 17 .

"(CNN) -- Spirit Airlines gets slammed for charging fees for almost everything except the air we breathe. (Although that fee could be coming soon.) The airline revels in its reputation as a super-low-cost carrier willing to take its lumps, so much that it launched an air travel State of Hate survey over the summer to share the hate air travelers feel about airlines as a whole. Almost 30,000 travelers filled out the survey in just a few days, in exchange for 8,000 Spirit reward miles. It turns out that travelers' hate wasn't only directed at Spirit, according to the airline's own survey. Passengers are mad at most U.S. airlines. ""I think if any organization asks for feedback, you would expect the vast majority of responses would be directed at the company that seeks it,"" Ben Baldanza, Spirit's president and CEO, said in a statement. ""But in this case, we were surprised that most consumers chose to share their frustrations about other airlines."" World's worst airport in 2014 is... What do customers hate? Air travelers are most upset about airline seats (20%), followed by lost bags (16%), delays (15%) and service (15%), Spirit's survey found. Fees came in fifth place (12%). Spirit doesn't get most of the blame in its own survey. Southwest Airlines gets the most complaints about seats (36%), followed by United Airlines' service (22%), American Airlines-owned US Airways' delays (22%), Spirit's fees (18%) and Delta Air Lines' costs (11%). ""Airlines mess up, and air travelers get frustrated,"" Baldanza said. ""The feedback we received makes it clear no airline is immune from upsetting their customers, and at Spirit, we can do a better job of explaining how flying with us is different."" Spirit's cheerful defense: Pay for what you want on your flight, and don't pay for what you don't want. The airline's new This is Spirit 101 campaign shares the details of how to reduce those fees, including paying for checked luggage from home and printing your boarding pass at home. It's true that passengers from the Americas (including the United States) are unhappiest in the world, according to a recent passenger survey from the air transport communications company SITA. About 28% of travelers from the Americas report major levels of dissatisfaction with their travel experiences, compared with a global average of 22%. But really, it's about Spirit . It's a good effort by Spirit to lump complaints about its fees into the conversation about Americans' growing resentment of most U.S. airlines. But really, most customers blame Spirit by a wide margin. Spirit ranked No. 1 in customer complaints about U.S. airlines filed with the U.S. Department of Transportation every year from 2009 to 2013, according to ""the Unfriendly Skies,"" a U.S. PIRG Education Fund study of five years of government data. Spirit received nearly three times as many complaints as the next airline during the study period, the report found. And Spirit has been hit with $565,000 in fines for violations of consumer protection laws involving deceptive advertising, baggage and oversales.","Spirit Airlines finds travelers hate something about most airlines .

"(CNN) -- Lana Lawless hits golf balls. She hits them hard and far, with astonishing accuracy. She won the Women's Long Drivers of America competition in 2008 when she hit a ball more than 250 yards. Lana is so good, in fact, that the LDA changed the rules this year to prevent her from competing. The LPGA has a rule to specifically exclude her, as well. In August 2009, 18-year-old runner Caster Semenya from South Africa won the gold medal in the 800-meter event of the World Track and Field Championships, beating her nearest rival by an astonishing two seconds. Afterward, she faced weeks of humiliating psychological, gynecological and physical testing to prove that she was female ordered by International Association of Athletics Federations. She eventually was allowed to keep her medal. In 1936, Jesse Owens won four track gold medals at the Olympic Games in Berlin. He faced German taunts that his African heritage somehow provided an innate athletic advantage and that blacks should be banned from competing in future games. And when baseball player Jackie Robinson shattered the racial barrier in professional sports, an act that we now celebrate for its courage, some players refused to share a locker room with him. Prejudice, discrimination and unfounded charges of advantage or somehow cheating are nothing new to sports. It raised its ugly head again in Lana's case. Lana is transsexual. She had sex-reassignment surgery in 2005. In every way that our society legally, socially or physically defines gender, she is female. She sued the LPGA and others, claiming a requirement in their bylaws requiring that participants be ""female-born"" is discriminatory. Make no mistake -- it is. We've been down this path before. In 1976, transsexual tennis player Renee Richards was banned from competing in the U.S. Open because of a similar ""women-born-women"" rule. The New York Supreme Court struck down the rule, and Richards competed professionally from 1977 to 1981. Despite concerns of that allowing her to compete against women gave her an inherent advantage, her highest overall ranking was 20th in 1979. Thirty-five years later, you'd think that we would be past this, but here we are. Different sport, same unfounded fears, same dehumanizing situation. And, same discrimination. I, too, am a transsexual athlete. Although the last time I competed on a mat was more than 30 years ago, I trained to compete against some of the elite women athletes in this country at the U.S. Open Freestyle Wrestling Championships in April. I finished sixth in my weight class. Some charge that we compete because of some inherent competitive advantage. Such charges are as ignorant as they are absurd. We compete for the same reasons that others do: Because we love our sport, because we are athletes and because we want to continue doing something we enjoy. Competition is a fundamental right that we refuse to relinquish simply because our path to manhood or womanhood was nontraditional. Click to read more opinions . The rest of the world is far ahead of the United States in this regard. In 2003, the International Olympic Committee became the first international sports organization to develop a policy of inclusion for transgender athletes. Recognition that a person's gender is more complicated than any single factor, combined with the inability to identify medically sound testing criteria, led to discontinuation of mandatory sex testing on female athletes 1999. (Tests may be done on a case-by-case basis, however.) According to IOC guidelines, transsexual athletes must have undergone hormone replacement therapy for at least two years, be legally recognized as the sex in which they want to compete and have had ""sex reassignment"" surgery in order to compete in their authentic gender. Many international sports organizations, including the governing body for wrestling, have adopted or defer to the IOC policies. As transgender people continue to integrate into all aspects of broader society, the practices that have historically been accepted as ""just the way it is"" will be identified as discrimination. So, too, will the daily indignities that so many of us face regarding bathrooms, jobs, housing, harassment and having to prove our manhood or womanhood be identified as unacceptable, illegal and inherently unfair. Lana's experience with the LPGA demonstrates that the combination of transgender people and athletics continues to be a volatile mixture that can easily devolve into an irrational, emotional argument rather than one based on fact or measurement. Regardless, it's only a matter of time before a transsexual athlete becomes the first to represent his or her country at the Olympics. That day will be one to celebrate as another part of a long tradition of overcoming barriers to competition. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Rose.","Golfer Lana Lawless banned from Women's Long Drivers, LPGA by anti-transsexual rule .

"Washington (CNN) -- He may not be zipping into a flight suit on the deck of an aircraft carrier, but President Barack Obama is embracing the set pieces of a commander at war weeks into his campaign against Islamic terrorists in Syria and Iraq. His advisers have similarly been keen to demonstrate his grasp of the global Ebola crisis, orchestrating two photo-ops in 24 hours — on a Sunday and a federal holiday — that showed Obama consulting with health officials about the outbreak. Neither instance featured any remarks from the president himself, or the chance to ask him questions. But as questions mount about the government's response to a range of challenges, the pictures underscore the importance the White House now places on appearing to have a grasp on the crises it's confronting. On Tuesday, Obama confers with top commanders and allied defense chiefs outside Washington at Joint Base Andrews — a Navy and Air Force installation that's more familiar to Obama as the seconds-long layover before jetting off on Air Force One or the site of weekend golf. Last week he made a rare trip across the Potomac to convene meetings with his top military brass at the Pentagon, a session he admitted would take place at the White House in calmer times. ""Now was a good time for me to come over to the Pentagon and have an opportunity to hear from our top military about the work that they're doing,"" he said on Wednesday. And last month Obama flew to Tampa for an in-person update on the war he's waging against ISIS at U.S. Central Command, which has been executing his plan to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" the terror group. The wartime photo-op is a tool familiar to presidents going back decades: Think of the ""Mission Accomplished"" banner hanging behind former President George W. Bush on the USS Abraham Lincoln as he declared an end to major combat operations in Iraq, 8½ years and thousands of casualties before the war ended. That moment — which Bush later said he regretted and which all future presidents will likely use as a model to avoid — is a far cry from the moments the White House is crafting for Obama, which have come as the president receives updates and advice from top commanders. So, too, have the president's aides been careful to demonstrate their grasp on the unfolding Ebola crisis, orchestrating a Sunday photograph — shot through the Oval Office window — of Obama discussing the latest Ebola case in Dallas with his Health and Human Services secretary. On Monday, with most of the White House darkened for the Columbus Day holiday, photographers were permitted to capture Obama meeting with top health officials to further hash out what went wrong in Dallas, where a nurse who was caring for an African patient with Ebola contracted the virus herself. For a president who has claimed to be uninterested in ""photo-ops,"" the rash of appearances seem to repudiate oft-cited criticism that Obama remains too detached — a line Republicans repeated on Sunday. ""I would say that we don't know exactly who's in charge,"" Sen. John McCain said of the Ebola outbreak on CNN's ""State of the Union.""","President is holding more photo-ops as his administration is eager to show him hard at work .

"(CNN) -- Record-breaking daredevil Nik Wallenda completed Sunday what he called his most challenging feat to date: a tightrope walk between two skyscrapers 600 feet above downtown Chicago, partly blindfolded. Crowds below cheered on the seventh-generation aerialist, who wore a microphone during his untethered walk. The ""Skyscraper Live"" walk was broadcast on Discovery. ""I love Chicago, and Chicago definitely loves me. What an amazing roar,"" the 35-year-old said as he crossed above the Chicago River. The walk consisted of two parts, starting from Marina City's West Tower, about 588 feet high. He crossed above the Chicago River to the Leo Burnett Building in just under seven minutes, finishing 671 feet above the street, according to Skyscraper Live's website. After he returned to the West Tower, he crossed to the East Tower blindfolded in one minute and 20 seconds. As a member of the famous Flying Wallendas, founded by his grandfather Karl Wallenda in the 1920s, Wallenda is no stranger to death-defying stunts. He walked across a wire 1,500 feet above a river in Arizona in June 2013, becoming the first person to traverse the gorge near Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona. Before that, he made a record journey across Niagara Falls in 2012. Peril also runs in the Wallenda family. Great-grandfather Karl Wallenda was killed at 73 while attempting to walk between two buildings in Puerto Rico in 1978. But on Sunday, Wallenda made it look easy. ""I'm so blessed for these opportunities,"" he said during his walk. ""You guys watching think I'm crazy, but this is what I was made for."" .","NEW: The seventh-generation aerialist's walk was broadcast on Discovery .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama defended the Senate Intelligence Committee's decision Tuesday to release a controversial torture report, arguing that while there was never a ""perfect"" time to release the report, it's important to publicly admit that the country made mistakes. ""One of the things that sets us apart from other countries is when we make mistakes, we admit them,"" Obama said in an interview with ""Telemundo"" on Tuesday that aired simultaneously on Univision. ""We did some things that violated who we are as a people,"" he added. The report, which details the CIA's extreme interrogation techniques used on terrorists after the September 11th attacks, was released by the Senate Intelligence Committee despite a last-minute pleas from Secretary of State John Kerry and members of Congress not to release the information to the public at this time, fearing that its release could spark global attacks against Americans. While the President acknowledged those concerns, he said his administration has taken precautionary measures around the world to prepare for any type of global reaction. Earlier Tuesday, the CIA Director John Brennan defended the techniques outlined in the report, saying that the interrogations ""did produce intelligence that helped thwart attack plans, capture terrorists and save lives."" But Obama contested their reasoning to Univision's Jorge Ramos arguing, ""The information we get isn't necessarily better than doing things the right way."" Under his administration, Obama wouldn't say if any types of torturous interrogation techniques have been used on detainees, but he asserted that if they were, they would not be tolerated and that perpetrators would be 'held into account' for breaking the law. Moving forward, Obama says he will effort ways to hold the CIA accountable for the way it treats detainees, in order to ensure that some of the techniques outlined in the report aren't used again. ""The lines of accountability that needed to be set up weren't always in place,"" the President told Diaz-Balart. In a hypothetical situation -- where the U.S. was attacked in a similar way as it was on September 11th -- the President said that he still would not condone the types of torture techniques described in the report, and that he is trying to put accountability systems in place now, should that become a problem in the future.","President Barack Obama defended the release of a new report outlining Bush-era CIA interrogation tactics .

"(CNN) -- The intrigue over the whereabouts of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un deepened Friday after the country's state news agency failed to issue a report about his expected visit to the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun in Pyongyang. In previous years, Kim has visited the shrines of his late father and grandfather at midnight on the eve of the 69th anniversary of the founding of the Workers' Party of North Korea. The Workers' Party, founded in 1945, is North Korea's political party and is considered one of the country's most crucial institutions alongside the military. Kim Jong Un misses shrine visit . KCNA has typically filed a report on the visit within hours of it happening, but so far this year nothing has been issued. Analysts are puzzled and speculation is running rampant about why Kim has been out of the public eye. He hasn't made a public appearance in over a month, and was reportedly last seen at a concert with his wife September 3. State media attempted to explain his absence by saying Kim was experiencing ""discomfort."" He had been seen hobbling earlier in the summer, prompting theories ranging from weight gain to gout. There have also been questions about the possible meaning behind his absence: Is he genuinely sick or are there machinations within the North Korean power circle? Is Kim Jong Un's sister in charge? North Korea as Rorschach test . ""Whenever someone doesn't show up in the public, we tend to speculate something of a power struggle,"" said Han Park, author of ""North Korea Demystified."" Because not much is known about North Korea's internal politics, observers scrutinize public functions and ceremonies to see who appears and who does not. ""We're always operating on this incomplete info,"" said Joshua Stanton, a North Korea observer who created the website One Free Korea, which is critical of the regime. Drawing conclusions about what's happening in North Korea has been likened to a Rorschach test -- it's a reflection of the views of whoever is drawing the conclusions, rather than an informed analysis based on facts. And the facts in the reclusive country are murky at best. ""People have a tendency to see the things they want to see,"" Stanton said. ""We should default to skepticism."" Opinion: Why Kim is probably still in charge . North Korea's diplomacy efforts . With its top leader missing in action, North Korea has extended its diplomatic efforts with the outside world. One of its officials said the regime was ready to restart the six-party nuclear talks, which include Russia, the United States, China, Japan and South Korea. It has also reached out to the European Union and South Korea. High-ranking Pyongyang officials visited South Korea on Saturday, but just days later, the two countries were exchanging fire at a disputed maritime demarcation line. The mixed messages reflect Pyongyang's ""state of constant and ever-shifting cost-benefit calculation to maximize its national self interests,"" said Jasper Kim, founder of the Asia-Pacific Global Research Group. ""Every move North Korea makes is a negotiation attempt to see which states will accede and offer something of value in exchange for some level of stability. This has and always will be North Korea's dominant negotiation strategy."" Longest absence . Kim made only one official appearance in September. This has only happened once before, in September 2010, and that was the month in which Kim made his first official public appearance alongside his father at Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, according to NK News, a website devoted to analyzing North Korea. The current absence is Kim's longest since he first began making official appearances in 2010, NK News said. His longest absence as Supreme Leader prior to this was a 24-day period between June 7 and July 1, 2012. His second longest absence ever was for 29 days between July 28 and August 27, 2011 -- while his father was still alive, NK News said. Kim's sole public appearance in September was at a Moranbong Band concert at Pyongyang's Mansudae Art Theatre, reported by state media on September 4. He was accompanied by his wife Ri Sol Ju, his sister Kim Yo Jong and several top officials including Hwang Pyong So. With Kim out of sight, North Korean top brass pay visit to South . CNN's Paula Hancocks, KJ Kwon, Michael Martinez, Brian Todd and Dugald McConnell contributed to this report from Seoul.","NEW: KCNA was expected to release report on Kim's visit to shrine .

"(CNN) -- I hope President Obama called to congratulate Mia Love. The way he called college student Sandra Fluke after Rush Limbaugh called her a ""prostitute."" The way he called the NBA's first openly gay player, Jason Collins. The way he called the San Francisco Giants after they won the World Series. I hope he called Mia Love because her story is every bit as unlikely, courageous and yes, inspirational, as his own. Love -- the first black Republican woman elected to Congress -- will not be his political ally and that's OK. I spoke with membership services and blacks are no longer revoked for voting Republican. If you don't believe me, please note the most popular black television character on network television is Scandal's ""Olivia Pope."" She worked to elect a Republican president twice and no one on #blacktwitter calls her an Uncle/Aunt Tom. Love is progress, whether so-called progressives want to embrace it or not. Her election is a reflection, yea an extension of the Rev.. Martin Luther King Jr's dream. The daughter of Haitian immigrants, born in Brooklyn, living in Utah, a state that is less than 1% black, judged by the content of her character. And because of that, she is coming to Washington. If that is not what the dream is all about then we truly have lost our way. As Democrats spend the remainder of the week infighting after losing the Senate, licking wounds from gubernatorial defeats in blue/purple states such as Illinois and Wisconsin, and searching for survivors in what can only be described as a midterm slaughter, I can't help but wonder if the victor with the most influence on 2016 is Love. For if the sexist/racist/anti-immigration narrative that has long dogged the GOP can, at the very least, be challenged by her presence at a campaign, what will Democrats use to fire up low-information liberals? The blue's yin to the red's ""Obama is the worse president ever"" yang. Not to mention that Love (along with South Carolina's Tim Scott, the first black senator elected in the South since Reconstruction) is an affront to those Republican voters who do harbor racist thoughts. Whether Love and Scott will go along to get along when the conversation regarding immigration or public assistance starts to sound a little too much like the GOP of the 1990s remains to be seen. But what is clear is that Love knows how to overcome adversity. Her father worked as a janitor, among other jobs, to put her through school at the University of Hartford. After speaking at the Republican National Convention in 2012, where she said ""my parents immigrated to the U.S. with $10 in their pocket ... when times got tough, they didn't look to Washington, they looked within"" as well as that Obama's ""policies have failed."" Afterward, her Wikipedia page was vandalized, as those who didn't approve of her brief address called her a ""whore,"" ""sellout"" and ""House N--r."" Insert ""war on women"" joke here. The first time she ran for Congress, she lost. Yet through it all, she persevered. Perhaps when Sen. Rand Paul said the GOP had a shot to attract a third of the black vote in 2016, he had Love in mind. Folks can identify with the pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps narrative that is often embraced by GOP minority candidates in one way or another. For more than 40 years, Democratic presidential candidates have enjoyed the support of more than 80% of black voters, and yet the community's unemployment rate remains twice that of its white counterpart. The wealth gap between blacks and whites has grown. The criminal justice system is riddled with discrepancies along racial lines. Paul has spoken about these concerns with compassion, albeit clumsily at times. Newly elected Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner, a Republican, aggressively went after the black vote in Chicago â€” despite it being President Obama's backyard â€” with a message that he could turn around the economic woes that have hampered the community. And in turn he did manage to receive endorsements from numerous pastors and high-profile blacks. Of course it didn't hurt that the wealthy Republican invested $1 million of his own money in the South Side Community Federal Credit Union, which is in a predominantly black neighborhood. ""(He's) taking the black vote for granted,"" Rauner said in a debate with Quinn that was sponsored by the Urban League. While he ended up with only 6% of the black vote, the fact that he would be so bold with his intentions shows the days of Republicans ignoring the black vote may in fact be gone. Just south of Rauner, Ohio incumbent Gov. John Kasich received 26% of the black vote. If blacks are willing to buck the trend and vote Republican, then it would only make sense that the GOP would have black candidates. And black elected officials, like Love, an outsider who came out of nowhere to shock the world and claim her own piece of the dream. Sort of like another history-making black elected official we know.","Mia Love became the first black Republican woman in Congress .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China will cut production of rare earths -- minerals vital for technology makers worldwide -- by 20%, a move that threatens to inflame trade tensions between Beijing and Washington. Rare earths are 17 minerals with magnetic and conductive properties that are used in most of today's electronic devices, including flat-screen televisions, smart phones, hybrid cars and weapons. Nearly all of the world's supply of rare earths comes from China. China changed production rules, which will close down one-third of the nation's 23 mines and about half of 99 smelting companies, Jia Yinsong, director of the ministry's rare earths office, told China Daily Wednesday. U.S. military's rare earth concerns . China implemented the rules to improve environmental conditions and help consolidate the industry, officials said. The new regulations boost the minimum annual output at mines to 20,000 metric tons and 2,000 tons per year for smelting operation -- a move which will weed out smaller operations. The U.S., Japan and the European Union have complained to the World Trade Organization that China's rare earths export restrictions violate trade rules. WTO case against China over rare earths announced by Obama . The minerals include cerium, neodymium, dysprosium, tungsten and molybdenum. Tungsten, for example, is used in electronics, automotive, aerospace and medical technologies. China produces 91% of the world's tungsten. Molybdenum is a metallic element used for filaments in light bulbs. China produces 36% of the world's molybdenum. Rare earths are not actually ""rare,"" and can be found in other countries - including the U.S. - but are difficult to mine safely. About a third of the world's rare earth deposits are in China but the country controls more than 90% of production, in part due to its lower labor costs and less stringent environmental regulations.

"(CNN) -- Should college athletes at least be paid the same minimum wage as the students who usher at their games or sell refreshments to fans? A former University of Houston soccer player thinks so, and is suing hundreds of Division 1 universities and the NCAA, comparing collegiate athletics to work-study programs and seeking to get minimum wage payment for athletes. It's just the latest of a handful of pay-for-play lawsuits now before federal courts. ""Work-study participants who sell programs or usher at athletic events are paid, on average, $9.03 an hour,"" states the lawsuit, filed in federal court in Indiana. ""But student athletes whose performance creates such student jobs in the athletic department are paid nothing."" Samantha Sackos, who played for the University of Houston from 2010 to 2014, filed the suit and claims she is owed back pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act for the time she was ""employed"" as ""an unpaid student athlete."" Students in work-study programs, her lawsuit says, are considered part-time employees who must be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. But athletes aren't afforded that pay. Instead, because of NCAA rules, their benefits are capped at the cost of a scholarship. Sackos' lawsuit points out that students in work-study programs are routinely paid for their work. For example, the lawsuit says, on average, a wage of $10.44 is paid to students who provide tours on campus, $11.25 for food concession and counter attendants, and $14.11 for building and grounds cleaning. ""The (d)efendants have jointly agreed, and conspired, to deprive student athletes of lawfully earned, modest wages and of equal treatment under law,"" wrote Philadelphia attorney Paul L. McDonald. The NCAA responded by saying it is ""evaluating the complaint, but disagree[s] that student-athletes are participating in athletics as employees. Student-athletes have a passion for their sport and a commitment to their teammates that can't be equated to punching a time clock."" Sackos is the latest athlete to sue the NCAA over pay-for-play issues. Her suit mirrors some of the issues raised by Northwestern University football players who took their school to labor court to establish that they were employees of the university with the right to unionize and make demands. A judge with the National Labor Relations Board agreed that they were employees after hearing testimony about the tight controls kept on student athletes and the emphasis on sport over academics. That ruling is being appealed by Northwestern. ""Student athletes perform longer, more rigorous hours -- nearer full time,"" Sackos' lawsuit reads. They are ""subject to stricter, more exacting supervision"" and ""confer as many, if not more, tangible and intangible benefits on NCAA Division I Member Schools."" Sackos' suit might also be helped by another legal victory for student athletes: the recent federal court verdict in favor of former UCLA player Ed O'Bannon, who sued the NCAA over the use of his likeness and image. A judge in that case ruled that the NCAA's ban on paying players is a violation of anti-trust law and as a result, starting in 2016, schools can choose to pay athletes up to $5,000 per year for the use of their images. Another set of litigation is pending before the federal courts that seeks to eliminate the pay cap on college athletes, and make college sports more like the pros. The NCAA is fighting that suit, too. McDonald said Sackos, who is still a student and busy with classes and preparing for grad school, wasn't available to talk about her lawsuit.","University of Houston student notes those who work at games are paid .

"Boston (CNN) -- Two years ago, James ""Whitey"" Bulger -- the famed and much-feared head of the Boston mob -- was sitting pretty in Santa Monica, California. Today, he's sitting in prison, where he could potentially spend the rest of the life. The turn of events was capped Monday when a federal jury found the former mob boss guilty on 31 of 32 counts -- including extortion, money laundering, drug dealing and weapons possession. The jury held Bulger responsible for the murder of 11 people. The 83-year-old Bulger faces a maximum sentence of up to life, plus 30 years in prison. ""So many peoples' lives were so terribly harmed by the criminal actions of Bulger and his crew. And today's conviction does not alter that harm, and it doesn't lessen it,"" said U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, speaking about the victims and their families. ""However, we hope that they find some degree of comfort in the fact that today has come, and Bulger is being held accountable for his horrific crimes,"" she said. Bulger was accused of involvement in killing 19 people, including two women. Bulger linked to 11 murders . The jury found Bulger played a role in 11 of those murders, and that the evidence did not prove he was involved in seven, stretching back to 1973. The jury made no finding in one murder. Pat Donahue, widow of victim Michael Donahue, cried openly when the verdict was announced. Victim Eddie Connors' daughter, Karen, clenched her fists and said, ""Yes"" when her father's death by Bulger was proved. But the daughter of victim Francis ""Buddy"" Leonard left court after the jury did not find enough evidence to link Bulger to his death. ""Thirty-eight years ago when my father died, we always knew who killed him. We still know who killed him, and we still cant get any justice,"" said Connie Leonard, now grown. And victim Debra Davis' brother, Steven Davis, left in disbelief after the jury had ""no finding"" in her death. Debra Davis was dating Bulger partner Steve Flemmi, and one day in 1981 just didn't come home. ""It's hard to digest. With all the years since '81, I've been looking for answers, searching for answers, and I come out with an NF. It's not good enough,"" Steven Davis told CNN. ""I put up a big fight for justice, for answers. Some people say closure. I don't believe in closure, but I believe that I deserve more than an NF. I'm disappointed,"" he said. Their lives had one thing in common: Bulger . 16 years on the lam . The eight men and four women of the jury deliberated for five days, over more than 32 hours, before reaching their verdict. The only count Bulger was not found guilty of was on the alleged extortion of Kevin Hayes, a ticket broker, who had said he was warned in 1994 that he had to give ""payoffs"" to Bulger in order to operate. Bulger showed no emotion as the verdicts were read. They came after seven weeks of testimony about murder, extortion, drug trafficking, loansharking, bookmaking and other gangster crimes covering the time Bulger ran Boston's Irish mob from the early '70s through late 1994, when he fled the city. Share your thoughts on the verdict . The case closes an epic criminal tale that included a life on the lam for 16 years that began when a crooked FBI agent told Bulger that he was about to be indicted on federal racketeering charges. The gangster who ruled south Boston soon became one of the most wanted men in America. Bulger the FBI informant became Bulger the FBI fugitive. It was the stuff of Hollywood moviemaking, and in fact, Bulger's mob-boss brutality inspired Jack Nicholson's character in the film ""The Departed,"" which was directed by Martin Scorsese and won four Oscars in 2006, including best picture. Then, in 2011, the FBI finally tracked him down: Bulger was living on the other side of the country in an apartment just blocks from the beaches of Santa Monica. He had about $822,000 in cash -- largely $100 bills -- hidden inside a wall in his apartment, located in a tourist haven right beside Los Angeles. Bulger also kept 30 guns in his residence. Daring to the end, Bulger was hiding in plain sight, living under an alias with his girlfriend. They called themselves Charlie and Carol Gasko. Bulger 'pleased' by the verdict . It was a long fall for Bulger: One of America's notorious mob bosses was called ""a rat bastard"" and ""a coward"" by victims' relatives and former associates who attended or watched the trial. Bulger declined to take the stand to testify in his defense, telling the judge, outside the jury's presence, that his trial was ""a sham"" because he had an immunity deal with federal authorities in exchange for being an informant. The judge had ruled he couldn't make that claim during his trial. However, after the verdict, Bulger's lawyer said that his client was ""very pleased"" by both the trial and its outcome. ""It was important to him that the government corruption be exposed, and important to him that people see first hand the deals that the government was able to make with certain people,"" attorney Jay Carney told reporters. Bulger's sentencing is scheduled for November 13. His girlfriend, Catherine Greig, pleaded guilty in March to charges of conspiracy to harbor a fugitive, identity fraud and conspiracy to commit identity fraud. Her crime was ""the most extreme case"" of harboring a fugitive, prosecutors said. Greig, 61, was sentenced in June to eight years in federal prison.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- More than two years after Fox entertainment executive Gavin Smith vanished in Southern California, his body has been found, authorities said. Hikers found his body this week in a shallow grave in Palmdale, according to Lt. Dave Dolson of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. ""It's a crucial piece of evidence,"" Dolson said. ""Because of the discovery of Gavin's remains, there's potentially a lot more evidence for us to process."" Smith disappeared in May 2012 after leaving a friend's house without saying where he was going. His black Mercedes was recovered at a storage facility last year, but his whereabouts remained a mystery. Authorities identified his body Wednesday. A break in the case . Dolson said police ""have a pretty good picture"" on what happened the night Smith disappeared. Authorities believe they know how and why Smith was killed, but would not share that information just yet. ""We have witnesses that are paramount to the case,"" Dolson said. ""There was evidence in the car that indicated he was killed in the car."" When asked if Smith's remains showed signs of stabbing or strangulation, Dolson said, ""There's indications that there was some trauma."" Dolson said police may not be able to determine the cause of death because the body had been missing for so long. Authorities are not actively looking for anyone in the case, he said. Husband, father . Smith, 57, was last seen when he left a friend's house in Ventura County, north of Los Angeles. When he didn't pick up one of his sons from school, a search ensued. His distraught wife and three sons offered a $20,000 reward for information on his whereabouts. Death certificate issued before body found . Days became months, but there were no signs of the former UCLA basketball player. That changed in February last year, when his car was found at a storage facility in Simi Valley, northwest of Los Angeles. In the months since his disappearance, authorities said there was mounting evidence that he had been killed. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department officially declared him dead in May this year. His death certificate was dated May 1, 2012, the same night he vanished. It was issued two years to the day he went missing. Who had his car? After his car was recovered, authorities considered his case a homicide even though his body had not been found. The storage facility was rented by John Creech, who authorities said they wanted to talk to in connection with the case. He was sentenced to prison on unrelated drug charges. Creech remains a ""person of interest"" in the case, Dolson said. Faith Karimi wrote and reported from Atlanta, and JR Nichols reported from Los Angeles.

"Washington (CNN) -- The government shouldn't make health care providers fully cover prenatal tests like amniocentesis, which can determine the possibility of Down syndrome or other fetal problems, Republican presidential hopeful Rick Santorum said Sunday. Santorum, an outspoken opponent of abortion rights, told the CBS News program ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday that amniocentesis ""more often than not"" results in abortion. ""People have the right to do it, but to have the government force people to provide it free, to me, is a bit loaded,"" he said. The former Pennsylvania senator was arguing against what he called a mandate in the health care legislation passed by President Barack Obama and Democrats in 2010. He said Saturday at an appearance in Ohio that the law was intended to increase abortions and reduce overall health care costs. ""One of the mandates is they require free prenatal testing in every insurance policy in America,"" Santorum, a conservative Roman Catholic, told a Christian Alliance luncheon in Columbus. ""Why? Because it saves money in health care. Why? Because free prenatal testing ends up in more abortions and therefore less care that has to be done, because we cull the ranks of the disabled in our society."" He added that the requirement was ""another hidden message as to what President Obama thinks of those who are less able."" The White House referred CNN to Obama's re-election campaign for comment, and campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith called Santorum's remarks ""the latest in a long string of unfortunate comments in the race to the bottom that the Republican presidential primary has become."" ""Prenatal screenings are essential to promote the health of both the mother and baby and to ensure safe deliveries,"" Smith said. ""These misinformed and dangerous comments reinforce why women cannot trust any of the Republican candidates for president."" On Sunday, Santorum mentioned his own experience with this 3-year-old daughter Isabella, who has Trisomy 18, a chromosome disorder that often results in stillbirths or early childhood death. He said prenatal testing showed the problem, and doctors recommend abortion in virtually all cases. Such a recommendation is common when any problem is detected through amniocentesis, said Santorum, who added that in such cases ""we know that 90% of Down syndrome children are aborted."" Some studies since the late 1990s do suggest a high percentage of women terminate their pregnancies after receiving a Down syndrome diagnosis, with one British study putting the figure as high as 92 percent. A 2005 study of nearly 1,100 pregnant women found 76% would consider an abortion if tests indicated their child would be born with Down syndrome. Now considered the main conservative challenger to the more moderate Mitt Romney, Santorum has shed a more understated demeanor to challenge both Romney and Obama as the Republican campaign heads toward a series of key primaries in coming weeks, including Super Tuesday on March 6. He continued throwing out the cultural red meat for primary voters Sunday night, telling a rally at a Georgia church that Obama was intent on starting a cultural war. As the audience roared with applause, he called on the country to build a foundation that will ""defend the church, defend the family, defend the nonprofit community, defend them from a government that wants to weaken them."" His attack on insurance coverage for prenatal testing was the latest in a series of controversial comments he has made since surging to the top tier of polls in the Republican presidential race. He also found himself defending other Saturday comments regarding Obama's religion, appearing to question the president's adherence to Bible-based Christian theology. Santorum said Saturday the president was not motivated by concerns for ordinary Americans but by ""some phony ideal, some phony theology. ""Oh, not a theology based on the Bible, a different theology. But no less a theology,"" he said. Asked about those remarks on CBS, Santorum said he was referring to Obama's energy policies, which he said favored what he called radical environmentalism. Asked specifically if he was questioning Obama's Christian beliefs, Santorum said: ""I wasn't suggesting the president is not a Christian. I accept the fact the president is a Christian."" Instead, he said he was taking on what he called ""an attempt to centralize power in the government."" ""I'm talking about the belief that man should be in charge of the Earth,"" Santorum said, and then in specific reference to Obama: ""I am talking about his worldview and the way he approaches problems in this country."" But former White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Sunday that Santorum's comments continued the kind of character attacks he said were typical of the GOP presidential race. ""I think that if you make comments like that, you make comments that are well over the line,"" Gibbs told ABC's ""This Week."" ""I think this GOP primary, in many cases .... has been a race to the bottom. We have seen nastiness, divisiveness, ugliness, distortions of opponents' records, of the president's records,"" he said. The negative tone of the campaign was hurting the Republican candidates and causing low turnout numbers in some of the primaries so far, Gibbs added. ""It's just time to get rid of this mindset in our politics that, if we disagree, we have to question character and faith,"" Gibbs said. ""Those days have long passed in our politics. Our problems and our challenges are far too great."" The issues raised by Santorum follow another religious-themed controversy over the Obama administration's decision to require church-affiliated hospitals and other institutions to provide employees with health care coverage for contraception. Catholic bishops vehemently opposed the move, and the administration changed its rule to require health care insurers to provide free coverage for contraception rather than the churches or other religious-based institutions. Santorum's comments may appeal to some Republican voters who have questioned Obama's faith before, or others who saw the administration's recent contraception mandate as an overreach. Last month, Santorum was criticized by some for not correcting a voter who called the president a Muslim when she stood up to ask a question at one of his campaign town halls. On Sunday, Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels, who flirted with a presidential bid last year, told the CNN program ""State of the Union"" that the contraception issue could benefit Republicans if properly approached. ""These are the questions that I think Republicans can unite on,"" Daniels said. ""They do have to be framed, as they really are, as the defense of individual freedom against the right now limitless power of the state."" CNN's Chris Welch, Athena Jones, Ashley Killough and Gregory Wallace contributed to this report.","Obama's campaign calls Santorum's comments ""misinformed and dangerous""

"(CNN) -- When Fanny Smith lines up at the start gates in Sochi later this month, she will do so with form and, perhaps, the fates in her favor. As the reigning women's ski cross world champion, the 21-year-old will be one of the favorites for gold, but it's a minor miracle that she is racing at all. In December 2011, at the start of the World Cup season, the Swiss athlete suffered a serious knee injury. ""I broke everything -- my MCL (medial collateral ligament), LCL (lateral collateral ligament), two meniscus in the front of the knee,"" she told CNN's Human to Hero series. There was worse news to come when the knee surgeon walked into her room following the operation. ""He said, 'Fanny, I think you can't ski anymore. I think racing is finished for you,"" she recalls. It was a brutal assessment, but it didn't deter Smith -- who used it as the catalyst for the start of a remarkable recovery. ""I was so upset. But in my head I said to myself, 'You will see next year and shut your mouth!' "" Eleven long months followed but, with the help of staff at the University of Lausanne, Smith's defied her doctor's predictions, returning to action with renewed vigor at the start of the 2012-13 season. ""Everybody says, after an injury you become more strong. It's completely true. After my injury was the best season of my life,"" she says. Smith won the first three races of the year and four overall. With a total of six podiums from 10 starts, she cruised to her first ski cross World Cup title before capping her incredible comeback with gold at the world championships in Voss, Norway last March. Read more: Can Russia rise to Olympic occasion? ""You know, being world champion is something on one day, so that's really, really tough. But to win the other cup, the Crystal Globe (the prize for the top ranked ski cross racer throughout a season), it's like you've been carrying on your good races, race after race. So it's more satisfying,"" she says. Child's play . Ski cross -- a madcap race between four skiers over a narrow 1,000-meter course containing turns, jumps and bumps -- made its debut at the 2010 Winter Olympics, seven years after it became an official International Ski Federation discipline. ""I'm not old, but it feels like when you are a kid and you race your friends to the car -- the first to this, the first to that. In ski cross, it's actually completely that, it's who comes down first,"" Smith says. She strapped on her first set of skis at the age of two, growing up on the slopes of Gryon and Villars in the Swiss Alps, and tried ski cross for the first time when she was 12. ""I fell in love with the sport,"" she says. ""It was the perfect combination of what I like -- alpine spirit and freestyle. You have so many things to do."" Are your kids potential future Olympians? Send us your pictures . In 2006, aged 14, she won a place at a Swiss sports school in Brig-Glis -- a popular destination with winter sport athletes -- and it wasn't long before she began seriously thinking about becoming a professional ski crosser. ""The first time I actually decided I wanted to ski cross was at a race in Switzerland. It was the day (November 28, 2006) that ski cross was accepted into the Olympic Games in Vancouver,"" she says. ""(Me and my dad) were up in a gondola and he asked me, 'Fanny, do you want to go to the Olympic Games?' So, like a young kid, I was like, 'Yes! I want to go,' but you don't really know what it means."" Switzerland had a ski cross team at that time but it was impossible for Smith to commit full time. ""I was almost the youngest girl to start ski cross -- they couldn't carry me. I had no driving license and my parents worked so they couldn't drive me everywhere,"" she said. Sochi: The numbers game . Undeterred, her father set about finding sponsors and a trainer, and by the time she was 16 Smith was part of the Swiss national team. A year later in 2009, she entered her first World Cup race. It wasn't all plain sailing. ""I broke a tooth so, you know, it was fun. I was laughing and I was like so happy with a big smile. My dad said, 'Are you okay' and I was like, 'Yes! I love it! I want to continue."" With her gleaming smile restored, Smith didn't have to wait long before she had secured her first podium. A second place at a World Cup event in Lake Placid in January 2010 was followed by a maiden victory at Innichen/San Candido, Italy the following December. In between those results, a 17-year-old Smith skied to a seventh place finish in Vancouver -- but fast forward four years and she will be gunning for gold at Sochi Rosa Khutor Extreme Park when the women's ski cross starts on February 21. ""I think the big pressure is from the media and your country and after for me,"" she says. ""I'm just trying to, you know, be myself, enjoy the present moment of being in the Olympic Games and do my best."" Surprisingly, for someone who has spent half a lifetime up a mountain, she draws inspiration from a sporting hero who hails from lower altitudes. ""I really like the spirit of Roger Federer. It's not because he's Swiss, it's just because I think it is so incredible how he can be at the top and be so good for a long time and have not so much injury,"" she says. ""He needs to know his body so well. When he's old he will have a good body and not be in pain. So, I think he's someone who's done everything right."" Much like the great tennis champion, Smith, it seems, manages to combine a competitive edge -- ""I like to win"" -- with a more relaxed outlook on life away from the frantic twists and turns of the ski cross circuit. ""I try to always be positive,"" she says. ""Just live your life 100% and have no regrets."" Read more: Snowboard 'addict' cheats death .

"(CNN) -- The United Nations, citing reports of cluster bombs being used by the Ukrainian government, calls the apparent use of such weapons ""extremely alarming."" Human Rights Watch issued a report Monday that cited ""widespread use of cluster munitions"" by government forces against pro-Russian rebels in southeastern Ukraine in early October. The explosives injured dozens and killed at least six, including civilians as well as an employee of the International Committee of the Red Cross, according to HRW. ""The reports of use of cluster bombs are obviously extremely alarming,"" Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, said Tuesday. ""The secretary-general reiterates his call for an end to use of these indiscriminate weapons and the importance of a world free of cluster bombs."" Cluster munitions are rockets or bombs that hold dozens or hundreds of smaller bombs inside and are designed to discharge over a wide area when they hit the ground, according to HRW. The dispersal area of the armaments inside is often the size of a football field and puts both combatants and civilians at risk. The rockets that do not explode remain active and are a ""life-threatening hazard for civilians long after conflict,"" the U.N. website says. Ukraine's envoy at the United Nations denounced such reports. The Ukrainian army ""has never used cluster munition at the ATO (antiterrorist operation) area in the Eastern Ukraine,"" Yuriy Sergeyev, Ukrainian Ambassador to the United Nations tweeted Tuesday, citing the official Ministry of Defense statement. Investigators surveyed more than a dozen urban and rural locations during a weeklong trip in October during which they looked at dispersal of munitions and documented the unopened, malfunctioned bombs, according to the report. ""Witnesses also told us what it sounded like when the attack happened, that it was multiple smaller explosions which is typical of a cluster munitions attack, instead of single, larger ones,"" said Ole Solvang, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. The report added that though there is no conclusive evidence, it is likely that anti-government forces are also responsible for cluster munitions attacks. ""I think it is also an occasion to reiterate the (U.N. secretary-general's) call for a political solution for the current crisis in Ukraine,"" said Dujarric. In recent months, the United States and the European Union have placed sanctions against Russia over its ""illegal actions in Ukraine,"" Obama said in September. Kiev and the West accuse Russian President Vladimir Putin of arming and supporting the pro-Russia rebels, and of sending Russian troops into Ukraine over recent months. In 2008, over 100 countries in the United Nations signed on to ban cluster bombs, according to the U.N. website. Ukraine and Russia did not sign the agreement.","A Red Cross worker was among civilians injured by apparent cluster explosives in Ukraine .

"Washington (CNN) -- Republicans are committing political suicide and putting the support of an entire generation on the line by opposing an overhaul of U.S. immigration laws, President Barack Obama said Thursday night. ""It's anybody's guess how Republicans are thinking about this,"" Obama said during a town hall event in Santa Monica, California. ""If they were thinking long-term politically, it is suicide for them not to do this."" ""Because the demographics of the country are such that you will lose a generation of immigrants which says, 'That party doesn't seem to care about me,'"" he said. ""In the short term, they have a problem with the tea party and others who often express virulently anti-immigrant sentiment."" The President repeated his vow to sign an executive order making changes to the immigration system after the November 4 midterm elections. But he said ""all the executive authority I legally have"" won't be as effective as Congress approving legislation would be. Obama said he will make visa changes to allow more technically skilled workers to enter the United States, and noted that naturalized Americans have won 25% of the country's Nobel Prizes in the sciences. ""And so the idea that we would make it harder for talent to come here -- especially when so often that talent is coming to study here, going to school here, wants to stay here, wants to work here, wants to invest here -- makes no sense,"" he said. Obama had planned to sign an immigration-related executive order by now as part of his ""pen and phone"" strategy to bypass a gridlocked Congress. But a flood of unaccompanied children over the U.S.-Mexico border over the summer led the White House to delay that move until after the midterm elections. House Speaker John Boehner sharply criticized Obama on Thursday for the delay, which he called ""raw politics,"" designed to help endangered Senate Democrats keep their majority. The Ohio Republican issued a joint statement with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Virginia Republican. ""It's shocking that the White House now openly admits that President Obama is delaying his unilateral actions on immigration until after the November elections simply because of raw politics,"" the two said. Boehner and Goodlatte said no matter the timing, it's ""never acceptable"" for presidents to issue executive decrees that rewrite laws. ""By taking unilateral action on immigration, President Obama will inject serious constitutional questions into an already heated debate,"" the two said. ""Such shortsighted actions will undermine the American people's trust in the President's commitment to enforcing our immigration laws and will further set back any chance of enacting immigration reform.""","President Obama says opposing immigration reform will hurt Republicans politically .

"(CNN) -- William Talley sits in front of his computer for hours, clicking on every photo he can find online from the wreckage of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. Stuck 8,000 miles away in Tennessee, he has no other way of searching for his wife and 3-year-old daughter. ""What keeps running through my mind now is my baby calling my name -- 'papa, papa, papa,'"" he says. Talley, his wife Rose, and their child Wilrose live in Guiuan, the tropical paradise where Typhoon Haiyan made its first landfall. The area was devastated. ""I built a house there last year on an island outside of the city. I imagine everything is gone,"" he says. His imagination may be right. ""It's total damage -- 100% damage,"" Guiuan Mayor Christopher Gonzales has said. Almost all of the community's 50,000 people were left homeless. ""Everything is gone,"" said one resident. Talley is trying everything he can think of to make contact with Rose -- dialing all sorts of numbers in Guiuan, calling friends and contacts elsewhere in the Philippines, and using the online tools designed to help people find loved ones. So far, no luck. ""It hurts. It hurts badly,"" he says. ""I'm really worried for them. And if something has happened to my wife, the mother of my child, then who's going to be there to look after my child? I'm going to lose contact with my daughter altogether."" Talley's anguish is shared by thousands of others across the globe in the wake of Haiyan. With more than 2,000 people declared dead, more than 3,000 injured, and many more struggling without necessities, families around the world are in a state of desperation, praying for the best and fearing the worst. Faces of the storm . But Talley, 40, has another worry that few others can associate with. He was homeless at one point in his life, and ""grew up on the streets of Los Angeles."" ""That's why I'm so concerned for my child,"" he says. ""I don't want my child to have to live like I did."" In a CNN iReport, Talley -- a former firefighter -- asked anyone with a relief effort under way to take him along. ""I want to be there and aid in the relief efforts. Using the skills I possess to help injured, lost, and homeless; as well as establish communications so that many can be informed of the well-being of their families, who are displaced in outlying areas. I need to be there for my family as well and will do all I can to make sure this happens."" But even if that were possible, Talley faces another big obstacle: the reason he's in Tennessee. Talley suffers from ankle and knee injuries, and is awaiting a knee replacement. He's been in Gallatin, just outside Nashville, for four months, working with his doctor and awaiting surgery. The ankle injury stems from 2008, when he was working with the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs. He was part of its Division of Forestry and Wildland Fire Management. On one windy day, he was cutting down a tree in Whiteriver, Arizona. It fell onto his foot, shattering his ankle. Talley was unable to continue his job. He has received Supplemental Security Income ever since. He met his wife, now 41, online. He traveled to the Philippines to meet her in person. She grew up poor, on an island where there's a large coconut plantation. Members of her family were fishermen and farmers. When Talley met Rose, she worked as a cashier. They ended up getting married and combining their first names into one for their daughter, Wilrose. Talley built their small home, about 30 feet by 30 feet, out of concrete and hollow block. Two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen, and a living room. Last year, he crashed his motorcycle and broke his knee -- on the same leg as the ankle injury, his right. Talley last spoke with Rose 11 days ago. ""I told her how much I missed her, and how much I love them and my baby,"" he says. ""It's terrible. I can't focus,"" Talley adds. ""I go to the doctor today and I'm going to tell him to give me a steroid shot and joint fluid because I know what I'm going to have to do. I'm going to have to make my way to the Philippines.""","William Talley's wife and child were in Guiuan, where Haiyan made its first landfall .

"(CNN) -- Explorer Robert Falcon Scott died in 1912 while crossing Antarctica, but his story lives on in artifacts that continue to be discovered on the frozen continent at the bottom of the world. The most recent find: a century-old photographer's notebook in the ice at one of Scott's expedition bases in Antarctica. The notebook belonged to George Murray Levick, a surgeon and photographer who was part of Scott's 1910-13 expedition. It contains pencil notes about photos he took in 1911 at Cape Adare. ""It's an exciting find,"" said Nigel Watson, director of the Antarctic Heritage Trust. ""The notebook is a missing part of the official expedition record. After spending seven years conserving Scott's last expedition building and collection, we are delighted to still be finding new artifacts."" The notebook was found in January 2013 at another Scott camp, the Cape Evans base, after the summer snow melt around a building exposed it, said Paula Granger, communications manager for the trust. Notebook painstakingly conserved . After 100 years in the ice, the notebook's binding had dissolved, and the pages were stuck together. The trust hired Aline Leclercq, a paper conservator, to separate and clean the pages, which were digitally recorded. The notebook was rebuilt and sewn back together using cover remnants, the trust said. The remarks in the notebook refer to photos now held by the Scott Polar Research Institute. ""You can marry up what he's written down with the pictures,"" Granger said. Once the notebook was conserved, it was returned to Antarctica, Granger said. It's one of 11,000 artifacts at Cape Evans. Scott died in March 1912 . Scott was a British explorer who became famous during what historians call the heroic age of Antarctic exploration. He arrived at the South Pole in January 1912 to discover that his rival, Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, had beaten him to the spot by an estimated 33 days. Scott and several comrades died in March 1912 during the return journey. The trust said Levick was a member of a group of six men called the Northern Party, which spent the summer at Cape Adare but survived the 1912 winter in a snow cave before going to Cape Evans. In December, New Zealand's Antarctic Heritage Trust reported finding 100-year-old negatives in one of Scott's huts. The photos were taken during Ernest Shackleton's 1914-17 Ross Sea Party, another failed exploration whose members were forced to live in Scott's hut after their ship blew out to sea.","Notebook of photographer George Murray Levick found in the ice .

"New York (CNN) -- Actor Alec Baldwin was arrested Tuesday and issued two summonses -- one for disorderly conduct -- after riding a bicycle the wrong way on a New York street, police said. The ""30 Rock"" star allegedly became angry and started yelling at police after they asked him for identification to give him a summons, police said. The other summons was for riding a bike against the flow of traffic. Baldwin is to appear in court July 24. ""Police stated that he got belligerent and started arguing with them and using profanity,"" Deputy Chief Kim Y. Royster said. Baldwin was not carrying identification and police took him into custody, police said. The actor reportedly became angry at the officers, yelling ""Give me the summons already,"" a law enforcement official said. After his release, Baldwin took to Twitter, posting the badge number of the officer he said arrested him and saying, ""photographers outside my home ONCE AGAIN terrified my daughter and nearly hit her with a camera. The police did nothing."" In another tweet, he lamented, ""New York City is a mismanaged carnival of stupidity that is desperate for revenue and anxious to criminalize behavior once thought benign."" Once in custody, Baldwin was taken to a nearby precinct, where he reportedly asked the desk supervisor: ""How old are these officers, that they don't know who I am?"" according to a law enforcement official. Baldwin was stopped for riding a bicycle the wrong way on Fifth Avenue and 16th Street, police said. In a statement, a representative for Baldwin said, ""He is back home with his family."" This follows an incident last year that sparked media attention. In November, Baldwin made headlines after chasing a photographer outside his Manhattan apartment and using an anti-gay slur toward the man, according to TMZ. ""Get away from my wife and the baby with the camera,"" said Baldwin, who could be heard yelling on video taken of the incident. Baldwin later posted a statement on MSNBC's website saying, ""I did not intend to hurt or offend anyone with my choice of words, but clearly I have -- and for that I am deeply sorry. Words are important. I understand that, and will choose mine with great care going forward."" Last August, Baldwin was photographed holding a photographer's arms behind his back and pinning him over the hood of a parked car. Baldwin and the photographer called 911, but no charges were filed.

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- South African prosecutors have appealed Oscar Pistorius' verdict and sentence, hoping to convict him of a more serious charge or make him serve more time in the 2013 shooting death of his girlfriend. The appeal paperwork has been filed, National Prosecuting Authority spokesman Nathi Mncube said Tuesday. A judge sentenced Pistorius to five years in prison on October 21 after finding the double-amputee track star guilty of culpable homicide, or negligent killing, in the death of Reeva Steenkamp. Prosecutors originally took Pistorius to trial on a murder charge. In the appeal documents, the prosecution calls Pistorius' sentence ""shockingly light"" and inappropriate. A court hearing will be held on the matter, but no date has been set. The process could take six months, CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps said. Pistorius acknowledged shooting Steenkamp in February 2013. Prosecutors said he wanted to kill her; Pistorius said he mistook her for an intruder and her killing was a tragic accident. Prosecutors are arguing that Judge Thokozile Masipa misinterpreted a complex South African standard defining a technical form of intent that proved to be a central aspect of the case, according to Phelps. As a result, prosecutors argue, he should not have been convicted on the culpable homicide charge chosen by the judge. In explaining her sentence, Masipa concluded that Pistorius did not intend to kill Steenkamp. But critics of the verdict have argued that Masipa didn't correctly apply the intent standard, which is broader in South African law than what it typically means in casual conversation, Phelps said. In their appeal of the sentence, prosecutors would have to prove the five years given by Masipa is inappropriate in light of sentencing guidelines and similar cases, according to Phelps. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel called for a minimum sentence of 10 years. If an appeals court finds that the sentence is inappropriate, the court could set it aside and issue a new one. But appeals courts in South Africa are reluctant to get involved in sentencing decisions, Phelps said. Under South African law, Pistorius will have to serve at least one-sixth of his sentence before asking to be placed under correctional supervision. Correctional supervision usually means house arrest. CNN's Brent Swails reported from Johannesburg. CNN's Michael Pearson and Jason Hanna reported and wrote in Atlanta.","Verdict can be changed only if a court rules the judge misapplied law, CNN legal analyst says .

"(CNN) -- As a woman whose parents had cancer, I have quite a few things to say about dying with dignity. In 1984, my mother was diagnosed with stage four cancer of the ovaries, uterus, ureters, small intestine, bladder and kidney. I was 8. She was given six months to live. She refused to accept that and sought treatment in Tampa, Florida. Her condition improved until two years later, when she was diagnosed with a brain tumor. Her body was mangled from all the surgeries. She had to wear an ostomy bag, which I learned how to change because she was so weak. She had to give up her nursing career. She had to give up the fun things in life she enjoyed doing because her body couldn't take it. She no longer had the quality of life that she deserved. My father, no longer physically attracted to her, satisfied his physical needs with other women. She was too sick to give him what he physically wanted. In 1988, when she was well enough to be at home full time, my parents separated and filed for divorce. Cancer broke their foundation of love and trust. The pain didn't stop there. In 1992, she was diagnosed with stage four breast cancer and lost her breasts. The only part she felt that still identified her as a woman was taken away. The same year my father was diagnosed with brain cancer. He died quickly, three weeks after his diagnosis. He simply collapsed and died. My right to death with dignity at 29 . For years, she suffered. It's hard watching your mother cry over the pain. It's hard watching your mother break down piece by piece. For years, she fought a pain pill addiction. She wanted to live so she could raise her children but in reality, she spent her time in the hospitals, operating rooms and doctor's offices. Her hopes took a horrible turn. She suffered greatly for 17 years until 2001 when doctors found cancer on her spine. She killed herself three days later. The person who died was not my mother. She was not the funny, intelligent, strong and fierce woman I knew. The person who died was sad and had lost all hope. My last memory of my mother is of this person. Lying on the bed with a bottle of pills next to her and her eyes half open. There is no justice in her lasting legacy. She deserved better. She deserved to go in a more dignified way. Dying with dignity is more than just for the person who is dying. It's for their loved ones. If it meant my mother leaving this world the way she was in 1984 and not in 2001, then I would have supported her decision to do so. My last memories of her should have been when she was still full of life on the outside, even though she was dying on the inside. She chose to take her life anyway, except it was without her loved ones surrounding her saying their final words and making peace. She died alone. My sister found her. Her death was treated like a crime scene because she killed herself at home. There were no final words. No goodbyes. Nothing but the unimaginable guilt I carry with me every day because maybe I could have done something better for her. The danger of assisted suicide laws . It's not fair to throw stones at someone because they are through fighting. No one person or disease is the same, so it's unfair to judge and compare. Just because a person decides they are done does not make them weak or selfish. Dying with dignity is a brave decision to make. It's a decision that involves everyone, and it's one of the greatest gifts of love that person can give to those left behind. When assisted suicide is not the answer . Some say she beat cancer. She was given six months to live but lived for 17 years. But what kind of life was it? Was it a life worth living? She had so much to live for, but at what cost? What kind of life was it for her children? I can tell you it was hard. I was robbed of a childhood. It was years of struggles and tears. I would never wish what I had lived through on anyone. No child should have to see their parents suffer so much. Today, I'm happily married and have a 4-year-old son. I would never want him to watch either one of his parents suffer. If a diagnosis is final and the options are there, I just may choose to die with dignity and end my life on my terms. If you have to explain death, how hard is it to include dying before the suffering becomes too great? Sure, the experiences built me up to be strong and be able to handle some serious stress, and in part made me the person I am today, but I would gladly trade it back if my mother could have done things her way, when she really should have.

"(CNN) -- Roma returned to the top of Serie A with a 2-1 victory at 10-man Parma on Saturday to keep the Italian title race on a knife edge. Champions Inter Milan, who reached a first European Cup final since 1972 in midweek, now trail by one point ahead of Sunday's trip to Roma's capital rivals Lazio. Claudio Ranieri's team, who face Inter in the Italian Cup final, bounced back from last weekend's 2-1 defeat by Sampdoria to revive their title hopes with two matches to play. Captain Francesco Totti opened the scoring in the fifth minute after showing great control to chest down Daniele De Rossi's pass and lob Parma goalkeeper Antonio Mirante. Totti also hit the post 10 minutes into the second half, and then the veteran striker's cross allowed Rodrigo Taddei to head the second goal with 15 minutes left as Parma -- employing four strikers -- pressed to equalize. Totti was also involved as 10th-placed Parma had Luis Jimenez sent off for the third time since his loan arrival from Inter in February, with the Chilean receiving a second yellow card for a foul on the 33-year-old with two minutes left. ""I told my players to battle and then see if the ball would run for us. Last week it went against us but today it went for us,"" Ranieri told reporters. ""I'm not thinking about Lazio but obviously if they play their part, tomorrow's game should be a tough one to win."" Third-placed AC Milan almost certainly clinched qualification for next season's Champions League with a 1-0 win over Fiorentina despite being reduced to 10 men. Brazilian forward Ronaldinho netted the only goal from the penalty spot in the 78th minute after Mario Borriello was fouled, but teammate Massimo Ambrosini was sent off for a second bookable offense with two minutes to go. The victory was a boost for coach Leonardo, who was criticized by club president Silvio Berlusconi in midweek and faces an uncertain future. Milan moved nine points clear of fifth-placed Palermo, who travel to second-bottom Siena on Sunday, needing to win handsomely to redress a nine-goal inferior for-and-against ratio.

"(CNN) -- Authorities looking for Hannah Graham found human remains Saturday on an abandoned property eight miles from where the University of Virginia student was last seen five weeks ago, police said. Chesterfield County Sheriff's Department members participating in the search made the discovery before noon in southern Albemarle County in central Virginia, according to Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo. Shortly thereafter, a detective relayed the news to Graham's parents. ""These are human remains and forensic tests need to be conducted to determine the identification...,"" Longo told reporters. ""But nonetheless we wanted to be quick and timely to share that information with the Graham family."" The discovery comes 35 days after Graham was last spotted, on several surveillance cameras, in Charlottesville's Downtown Mall area. That footage showed her leaving the Tempo Bar at around 2 a.m. on September 13, as well as a man -- later identified by authorities as Jesse Matthew, 32 -- following her. On September 24, Matthew was taken into custody while camping on a beach in Galveston, Texas, some 1,300 miles from Charlottesville. He is the only person detained in connection with Graham's disappearance, charged with abduction with the intent to defile. He has also been linked by forensic evidence to the case of Morgan Harrington, a 20-year-old Virginia Tech student who was last seen hitchhiking along U.S. 29 outside of Charlottesville in October 2009. She was found dead on a nearby farm the following January. No arrests have been made in Harrington's case, and the cause of her death still is under investigation. Police, though, did recently seize a cab owned by Matthew that he was driving in Charlottesville in 2009, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN. Matthew's next court appearance in relation to Graham's disappearance is scheduled for December 4. Officials didn't say whether charges against anyone were imminent in light of Saturday's discovery. Surviving the 'Murdered Child's Club' 'A great deal of work ahead' Albemarle County Police Chief Steve Sellers did appeal to anyone who was in or knows the area in which the remains were found to contact authorities if they saw ""any suspicious activity"" or ""an individual fitting Jesse Matthew's description in that area about that time."" ""Today's discovery is a significant development, and we have a great deal of work ahead of us,"" said Sellers, noting Graham's case is now considered a ""death investigation."" ""We cannot and we will not jump to any conclusions."" The 18-year-old Graham was in her second year at the University of Virginia -- a member of the ski team and making straight A's, her parents say -- when she was last seen. ""She was extremely smart, very witty, very athletic,"" said Craig Maniglia, the coach of the high school softball team that Graham co-captained in Northern Virginia. Graham's last contact with friends -- telling them she was lost and trying to find a party, according to CNN affiliate WVIR -- came via text message at 1:20 a.m. the morning of September 13. Another Virginia family still seeking answers . Her disappearance prompted a massive search involving more than 1,200 volunteers, not to mention emotional appeals from officials like Longo and Graham's parents. Sunday's scheduled public search of Walnut Creek Park -- not far from where the remains were found -- was canceled, the Virginia Department of Emergency Management said in a statement. ""Authorities are focusing their attention on recent evidence, which limits law enforcement resources necessary to carry out a public search,"" the agency said. Social media commenters saddened . Earlier this week, John and Sue Graham pleaded for help finding their daughter, saying, ""It is heartbreaking for us that the person or persons who know where Hannah is have not come forward with that information. It is within their power ... to end this nightmare for us all."" Her friends hadn't relented, either. In a statement released to CNN, they asked 'that everyone in Charlottesville and surrounding areas be on the lookout for new clues. No clue is too small and every search of personal property, even if it does not yield a result, is helpful."" Their efforts continued as recently as Saturday, with the ""Help Find Hannah Graham"" Facebook page posting pictures of various volunteers handing out ribbons to businesses in downtown Charlottesville. Later in the day, that page was full of heartfelt reactions from friends and strangers alike. One woman wrote, ""Rest in peace beautiful angel."" And a man chimed in, about hearing the news: ""I wept as if she were family."" Coy Barefoot, a member of the University of Virginia adjunct faculty and a local media personality, told CNN that Saturday's discovery -- and the prospect it could contribute to breakthroughs in the cases of other missing women, such as Harrington -- stirred ""a mix of emotions here in Charlottesville."" ""I have seen people crying. I have cried tears myself,"" said Barefoot. ""But you're also, in the same moment, so relieved that there might be some closure for such a wounded family for such a wounded community.""","NEW: Agency: Search for Hannah Graham called off in light of ""recent evidence""

"(CNN) -- Bangladesh's prime minister acknowledged Thursday that her nation's garment industry is beset with problems, but said her government is moving rapidly to fix them. ""Bangladesh now is a place for good conditions for the investment,"" Sheikh Hasina told CNN's Christiane Amanpour eight days after a nine-story building collapsed on the outskirts of Dhaka, killing at least 437 people, most of them garment workers. She said 2,437 survivors were pulled from the rubble, where recovery work was continuing. ""Yes, there are some problems,"" she said, but added that a committee has been formed to ensure the safety of buildings and workers. ""This committee will submit the findings to the Cabinet committee and, side by side, we have been trying our best to improve the situation."" Hasina expressed little fear that international companies would stop doing business in Bangladesh as a result of the disaster. Investors have tapped into the Bangladeshi market not just because of its high-quality workers, she said. ""They get cheap labor,"" she said. ""That's why they come here."" Bangladesh vs. the U.S.: How much does it cost to make a denim shirt? But at least one company has pulled out of Bangladesh, citing a spate of fatal factory accidents. The Walt Disney Company sent a letter in March to vendors and licensees to transition production out of the ""highest-risk countries,"" such as Bangladesh, in order to bolster safety standards in its supply chain. Disney will halt production in four other countries: Ecuador, Venezuela, Belarus and Pakistan, by April 2014. The decision was made before last week's building collapse. It was prompted by the November fire at the Tazreen Fashions Factory in Bangladesh's capital Dhaka that killed 112 people, and another fire in Pakistan that killed 262 garment workers last September. Disney pulls out of Bangladesh factories . Asked about reports that only 18 inspectors are responsible for overseeing safety conditions in more than 100,000 garment factories in and around the capital city, Hasina said, ""We don't depend on only ... those inspectors."" Steps to improve conditions were taken before the collapse of the building in Rana Plaza in Savar, she said, citing passage by the Cabinet of a labor law that will be sent to Parliament. Hasina noted that workplace disasters have occurred in the United States, too; she cited last month's explosion of a fertilizer plant in West, Texas, in which 14 people died. ""Anywhere in the world, any accident can take place,"" she said. ""You cannot predict anything."" Amanpour, CNN's chief international correspondent, pointed out that local officials predicted that the building could collapse after cracks appeared on its walls on April 23, and they urged workers not to re-enter it. ""You are very correct,"" Hasina said. ""Unfortunately, in the morning, the owners of the factories put pressure to labor to enter."" She praised government officials for trying to prevent the workers at the five garment factories in the building from re-entering it on April 24, the morning of the collapse. ""It is not true that the government hasn't taken any steps,"" she said. She blamed the owners of the five factories as well as Sohel Rana, the building's owner, and disputed the suggestion that their political connections could protect them. Rana is under police investigation in relation to the deaths and has had his assets seized. Protesters have called for him to be hanged. ""The law will take its own course,"" she said. ""Criminal is criminal. They will get all the necessary action; that we can assure you. It is our promise to the people."" Hasina added, ""Any business person, if they commit any kind of crime, our government always takes action."" She pointed to the companies that source their products from such factories, saying they should pay well enough that factory owners can pay good salaries and ensure the business is safely run. ""They're partly responsible for it,"" she said. And she urged that the disaster be considered in context. ""You cannot blame the whole business or whole industry just for one incident,"" she said. Hasina said officials in her government ""are in favor of labor,"" having increased the minimum wage by 82%, built dormitories and seen to the health care needs of workers. She denied that the killing last year of a labor leader signified that her government is hostile toward unions. Aminul Islam's body, bearing signs of torture, was found four days after he disappeared in April 2012. ""Nobody knew that he was a labor leader,"" she said. It was only after his body was found, she said, ""that we came to know that he was a labor leader and he was assassinated."" More than a year later, she said, the case remains under investigation. The interview was carried out via satellite by Amanpour in New York and the prime minister in Dhaka. CNN has been unable to gain visas from the Bangladeshi government that would allow the network to send reporters to cover the country first-hand. That assertion was corroborated by a CNN executive, but the prime minister disputed it. ""It is not true,"" Hasina said. ""We never stop any media to come to Bangladesh."" Asked about restrictions on coverage imposed by the visa office, she said, ""Every country has these rules and regulations."" Thursday's interview came as activity resumed at thousands of Bangladeshi textile factories. Millions of workers in and around the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, returned to duty after the trade group that represents the garment industry decided it was safe to do so. This week, a delegation of the International Labour Organization arrived in Dhaka on a four-day visit to Bangladesh. ""Horror and regret must translate into urgent firm action,"" said Guy Ryder, the organization's director-general. ""Action now can prevent further tragedy. Inaction would mean that the next tragedy is simply a matter of time."" The incident has provoked widespread protests, including attacks on some textile facilities the demonstrators said are unsafe. The garment industry accounts for 77% of Bangladesh's exports -- a $20 billion industry for the nation.","Disney pulls out of Bangladesh factories .

"New York (CNN) -- New York City's Board of Health voted Thursday to require parents to sign a consent form before having their child undergo a controversial ultra-Orthodox Jewish circumcision ritual after two children died from the herpes virus contracted during the procedure, authorities said. The parental consent form must include information regarding the possible fatal risks of the ritual, according to Chanel Caraway, a spokeswoman from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. It's not clear if the form will absolve clergy from potential lawsuits. The ritual, known as the metzitzah b'peh, is a type of circumcision in which the person performing the procedure, or mohel, directly places his mouth on and sucks the blood from the baby's newly circumcised penis. The controversial ritual came under intense scrutiny earlier this year after health officials reported 11 babies had contracted herpes infections between 2000 and 2011. Why I didn't circumcise my sons . The health department reported that an estimated 20,493 infants in New York City were exposed to direct oral suction in that period. ""There is no safe way to perform oral suction on any open wound in a newborn,"" said the health commissioner, Dr. Thomas Farley. Baby boys who were reportedly circumcised ""with confirmed or probable orogenital suction"" between April 2006 and December 2011 had an estimated risk of contracting neonatal herpes (HSV-1) infection of 24.4 per 100,000 cases, 3.4 times greater than other infants, the health department said. ""The ethical duty to protect the interests of vulnerable infants and to support parents in making informed and responsible choices cannot be overridden,"" a group of doctors and bioethicists from the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics said in a letter to Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Yoram Unguru, a Jewish pediatrician, hailed the decision, saying authorities should protect children ""from the consequences of unwise decisions."" ""In my mind, the amendment doesn't go far enough -- getting parental consent for circumcision in general, that's appropriate and sufficient, but consent for the metzitzah b'peh should not be allowed,"" he said. It ""should not be performed, period."" Top pediatrics group: Benefits of infant circumcision outweigh risks . Members of the orthodox community blasted the decision, calling it an infringement of constitutional rights. ""By telling a mohel he is prohibited from performing a religious ritual unless he tells the parents that, by the way, the child might die in the process, you are forcing us to say something which we are convinced is wrong,"" said Rabbi David Niederman of the Brooklyn-based United Jewish Organization of Williamsburg. Niederman and other community members say they plan to contest the regulation. ""We want to work, we have tried, and we are committed to work with the Department of Health to address their concerns in any way, shape or form that does not conflict with our religious and constitutional rights,"" he said. ""The practice will continue."" Why I decided to circumcise my sons .","A parental consent form must include information regarding the possibly fatal risks of the ritual .

"(CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius' fall from grace culminated Tuesday with a five-year sentence in the shooting death of his girlfriend. The sentence was imposed for the charge of culpable homicide, which in South Africa means a person was killed unintentionally, but unlawfully. Under South African law, he will have to serve at least one-sixth of his sentence -- 10 months -- before he can ask to be placed under correctional supervision, usually house arrest, instead. Pistorius was also given a three-year sentence on a firearms charge, but it was suspended for five years on condition he's not found guilty of another crime where there's negligence involving a firearm during that period. That count related to an occasion when Pistorius discharged a handgun under a table in a busy restaurant. No one was hurt. During his trial, the double-amputee sprinter often sobbed at the mention of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp's name. He insisted that he mistook her for an intruder when he shot her through a toilet door on Valentine's Day 2013. But there was very little visible reaction from Pistorius as the sentence was read out in the Pretoria court. Speaking to CNN's Robyn Curnow in the last few weeks before his sentencing, Pistorius told her that he would respect and accept the decision of the court and that he was not afraid of imprisonment. He said he hoped to contribute while in prison by teaching people how to read or start a gym or running club. ""Oscar will embrace this opportunity to pay back to society,"" his uncle, Arnold Pistorius, told reporters. ""As an uncle, I hope Oscar will start his own healing process as he walks down the path of restoration. As a family, we are ready to support and guide Oscar as he serves his sentence."" The Steenkamp family's lawyer, Dup De Bruyn, said in a statement: ""The family is satisfied. They are glad that it is over and are satisfied that justice has been done."" Is the Blade Runner's career finished? Question of appeal . The prosecution had asked for a minimum prison sentence of 10 years for Pistorius. After the ruling Tuesday, South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority said it had not yet decided whether to appeal Judge Thokozile Masipa's verdict that he is not guilty of murder. Pistorius' defense had called for a sentence of house arrest and community service. There was no immediate reaction from the defense team on the sentencing. Both sides now have a 14-day period in which they can choose to lodge any appeal, according to CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps. On the eve of Pistorius' sentencing, his sister told Curnow that the lives of everyone close to the trial have already been changed forever, no matter the outcome. ""No one who's been close to the situation can just overcome it,"" Aimee Pistorius said. ""It's something my brother will carry with him forever and ... regardless of what's happening now, it's just a certain phase in a journey that will never end."" 'Mine and mine alone' Giving her reasoning Tuesday, Masipa emphasized that the decision on sentencing would be ""mine and mine alone."" She pointed out that sentencing is not an exact science but relies on an assessment of elements, including the nature and seriousness of the crime, the personal circumstances of the accused and the interests of society. She said she would also take into account the factors in sentencing of retribution, deterrence and rehabilitation. In any case, she said, ""sentencing is about achieving the right balance."" What will Oscar Pistorius face in prison? Prison not 'insurmountable challenge' In her final remarks, Masipa dismissed evidence given by probation officer Annette Vergeer that prison would not be able to accommodate Pistorius' disability, saying her testimony was based on outdated information and sketchy. She said Pistorius would not present the prison system with an ""insurmountable challenge."" The judge added that she felt that Pistorius' vulnerability had been overemphasized in the evidence given and that his excellent coping strategies -- shown in his ability to compete with able-bodied athletes -- had been overlooked. He would be able to continue treatment for physical problems and mental health issues while in prison, she said. Factors in her decision . In terms of the seriousness of the offense, Masipa said Pistorius had shown gross negligence in shooting into a small toilet cubicle, knowing there was someone inside who could not escape. He also knew how to handle firearms, she said, adding that these were ""very aggravating"" factors. On the other hand, mitigating factors include that Pistorius is a first offender and remorseful, Masipa said. She also mentioned his contribution to society in giving his time and money to charities and inspiring others with disabilities to believe they could succeed. Perhaps seeking to preempt criticism from those who'd like to see either a tougher or more lenient sentence, Masipa pointed out that the purpose of the court is to serve the public interest, not make itself popular. She also indicated that her sentence wasn't affected by Pistorius' fame. ""It would be a sad day for this country if the impression was to be created that there was one law for the poor and disadvantaged and another for the rich and famous,"" she said. The judge also highlighted the loss suffered by Steenkamp's family, which has had a negative effect on her father's health. Steenkamp was young, vivacious and full of life at the time of her death, she said. ""The loss of life cannot be reversed. Nothing I say or do today can reverse what happened,"" she said. 'Sweetest human being' Steenkamp, 29, was a law school graduate who turned to modeling in recent years. ""She was the kindest, sweetest human being, an angel on earth,"" said her agency, Capacity Relations. Pistorius, 27, made history when he became the first double-amputee to compete in the able-bodied Olympics in 2012. He was born without the fibulae in his legs, which were amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old. At the London Olympics, he ran on special carbon fiber blades that earned him the nickname ""Blade Runner."" Even though he didn't win a medal, he became an inspiration to the disabled and a national hero in South Africa. He took home three medals from the Paralympic Games, held shortly afterward. The International Olympic Committee declined to say Tuesday whether Pistorius would be allowed to compete again after being sentenced for Steenkamp's killing. ''We take note of the court's decision. This is a human tragedy for the family of Reeva Steenkamp and also for Oscar Pistorius. We hope very much that time will bring comfort to all those concerned but at this stage we have no further comment to make,"" the IOC said in a written statement to CNN. CNN's Emily Smith, Hilary Whiteman, Chris Eldergill and Faith Karimi contributed to this report, as did journalist Tony Wende in Pretoria.","NEW: Reeva Steenkamp's family is ""satisfied that justice has been done,"" lawyer says .

""South Park: The Game"" is a role-playing adventure in which players explore the fictional Colorado town and befriend the show's protagonists, Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman. The game is being developed by Obsidian Entertainment, which has designed critically-acclaimed role-playing games in the ""Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic"" and ""Neverwinter Nights"" franchises.

Acclaim Entertainment's ""South Park,"" a first-person-shooter game released in 1998 for the Nintendo 64, computer and original PlayStation, was panned by critics. Stone and Parker, along with their regular voice actors, provided the 13-year-old game's soundtrack, but it was criticized for being repetitive. With today's more advanced hardware and direct guidance from the creators, they have a shot at producing a better product.

"(CNN) -- Australia cricket international Phil Hughes has died after being hit in the head by a ball on Tuesday. The 25-year old, who had been hoping to regain his place in the team for next week's Test match against India, passed away on Thursday after failing to recover from an induced coma at a hospital in Sydney. The South Australia batsman, who would have turned 26 on Sunday, was fatally injured when hit by a ""bouncer,"" a short ball that bounces up towards the batsman's torso, near his left ear -- the ball somehow evading the cricketer's helmet as he swiveled to play a shot. Australian team doctor Peter Brukner told a press conference Thursday that Hughes suffered a ""massive bleed into his brain"" during the game on Tuesday afternoon. He said the ball hit the side of his neck and, ""as a result of that blow, his vertebral artery was compressed by the ball. That caused the artery to split and for bleeding to go up into the brain. And he had a massive bleed into his brain. This is frequently fatal at the time."" But he said doctors on the scene, including a specialist who had been in the crowd, managed to resuscitate him. He was later taken to hospital where they made ""an intervention"" to release pressure on his brain. He was then put in an induced coma but failed to recover. Family devastated . At the same press conference, James Sutherland, the CEO of Cricket Australia, paid tribute to the young cricketer. ""Without doubt he was a rising star, with his best cricket ahead of him,"" he said. ""He was a hero to kids around the nation and particularly those around his home grounds of New South Wales."" Michael Clarke, Australia's Test captain, then read a short statement on behalf of Hughes' family. ""We are devastated by the loss of our much-loved son and brother."" ""It's been a very difficult few days. We appreciate all the support we've received from family, friends, players, Cricket Australia and the general public. ""Cricket was Phillip's life, and we as a family shared that love of the game with him. ""We would like to thank all of the medical and nursing staff at St Vincent's Hospital, and Cricket NSW medical staff for their great efforts with Phillip, we love you."" Outpouring of emotion . His death has triggered an outpouring of emotion in Australia and among cricket enthusiasts the world over. A statement from the office of Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott read: ""Phillip Hughes was a young man living out his dreams. ""His death is a very sad day for cricket and a heartbreaking day for his family. What happened has touched millions of Australians. ""For a young life to be cut short playing our national game seems a shocking aberration. ""He was loved, admired and respected by his teammates and by legions of cricket fans. ""Australians' thoughts and prayers are with the Hughes family."" Former England international Nick Compton told CNN his former friend had lived ""life to the full.""

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- A judge found Oscar Pistorius guilty Friday of culpable homicide, the South African term for unintentionally, but unlawfully, killing a person. It's akin to negligent killing. A day before the verdict, Judge Thokozile Masipa cleared him of murder in the killing of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp. His sentencing starts on October 13, the judge said after granting him bail. There is no minimum sentence for culpable homicide in South African law, so it will be up to the judge to decide. The verdict also dealt with three other charges, all weapons-related. Pistorius was found not guilty of two -- a car sunroof shooting incident and illegal possession of ammunition found at his house. The judge found Pistorius guilty of the third: a charge involving a shooting at a restaurant. The maximum penalty for that is five years behind bars. But he could get a lesser sentence, such as a fine or the loss of his gun license. Shortly after the verdict, his uncle said they were relieved that he was convicted of a lesser charge, but there were ""no victors"" in the case. ""It won't bring Reeva back, but our hearts still go out for her family and friends,"" Arnold Pistorius said. Steenkamp's mother, June, told NBC News that Pistorius got the wrong verdict. ""She died a horrible death, a horrible, painful, terrible death and she suffered, you know? I can't believe that they believe that it was an accident,"" June Steenkamp said. Weapons charges . In the shooting from the car's sunroof, Masipa said the state failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. She said she didn't find the state's witnesses persuasive, and their versions of events differed. In the second charge, Pistorius was found not guilty of having illegal ammunition at his house. Masipa said the state failed to introduce evidence that proved he intended to possess the ammunition. Pistorius had said he was storing it in a safe for his father. In the restaurant shooting, she said the state had proved its case. Pistorius, she said, was trained in the use of guns and should not have handled one at the restaurant. Letting the world know . Masipa presided impassively over the high-profile trial for months. She finally let the world know what she was thinking on the first day of the verdict Thursday. Pistorius did not intend to kill his girlfriend, she said, accepting his defense that he thought he was defending himself from an intruder. Pistorius, 27, has always admitted firing the bullets that killed his girlfriend Steenkamp, a 29-year-old cover model about to turn reality TV star. He pleaded not guilty to murdering her in his home on Valentine's Day last year, saying the killing was a tragic mistake. But in grabbing his gun and heading toward the supposed threat, Pistorius ""acted too hastily and used excessive force,"" Masipa ruled Thursday. ""His conduct was negligent"" and not what a reasonable man would do in the circumstances -- not even a disabled one, she said. Defense arguments that his upbringing ""in a crime-riddled environment and in a home where the mother was paranoid and always carried a firearm"" might explain his conduct that night, but ""it does not excuse the conduct,"" Masipa said. ""The accused had reasonable time to reflect, to think and to conduct himself reasonably,"" she said. Not guilty of murder . Masipa on Thursday found Pistorius not guilty of murder, premeditated or otherwise. She said the prosecution had failed to prove its case that Pistorius and Steenkamp argued on the night of the killing, and that the Olympic track star then shot her in a rage. Masipa was not persuaded by the testimony of neighbors who said they heard shouting, screaming and shots. The neighbors' stories do not match the timings on phone records the night of the killing, she concluded, saying: ""Technology is more reliable than human perception and human memory."" She said she believed media coverage had contaminated testimonies, and that state witnesses were in and out of sleep the night of the killing. She knocked down other key aspects of the state's case: the fact that Steenkamp took her phone and locked herself in the bathroom allegedly out of fear for her safety, phone messages between the couple that showed some rocky patches, and stomach contents that might suggest the victim ate later than Pistorius said.

"(CNN) -- James Karl Buck helped free himself from an Egyptian jail with a one-word blog post from his cell phone. James Karl Buck sent a message using Twitter which helped get him out of an Egyptian jail. Buck, a graduate student from the University of California-Berkeley, was in Mahalla, Egypt, covering an anti-government protest when he and his translator, Mohammed Maree, were arrested April 10. On his way to the police station, Buck took out his cell phone and sent a message to his friends and contacts using the micro-blogging site Twitter. The message only had one word. ""Arrested."" Within seconds, colleagues in the United States and his blogger-friends in Egypt -- the same ones who had taught him the tool only a week earlier -- were alerted that he was being held.

Hossam el-Hamalawy, a Cairo-based blogger at UC-Berkeley, was one of the people who got word of Buck's arrest. ""At first I was worried about his safety,"" el-Hamalawy said. Then, el-Hamalawy took to the Web and wrote regular updates in his own blog to spread the information Buck was sending by Twitter. Nobody was sure how long Buck would be able to communicate.  See Buck describe what he saw and captured on film during the protests » . But Buck was able to send updates every couple of hours saying he was still detained, he had spoken to the prosecutor, he still had not been charged, and he was worried about Maree. ""Usually the first thing the police go for is the detainees' cameras and cellular phones,"" el-Hamalawy said. ""I'm surprised they left James with his phone."" Twitter is normally used to keep groups of people connected in less urgent situations.  Watch how Twitter works » . But Biz Stone, co-founder of Twitter, said he and others knew that the service could have wide-reaching effects early on, when the San-Francisco, California-based company used it to communicate during earthquakes. Stone said that as the service got more popular, they began to hear stories of people using Twitter during natural disasters with a focus on activism and journalism. Buck's urgent message is proof of the value of Twitter, Stone said. Buck's entry set off a chain of events that led to his college hiring a lawyer on his behalf. ""James' case is particularly compelling to us because of the simplicity of his message -- one word, 'arrested' --  and the speed with which the whole scene played out,"" Stone said. ""It highlights the simplicity and value of a real-time communication network that follows you wherever you go."" Initially, the Twitter message was a precaution -- something people could trace in case anything went wrong, Buck said. ""The most important thing on my mind was to let someone know where we were so that there would be some record of it ... so we couldn't [disappear],"" Buck said. ""As long as someone knew where we were, I felt like they couldn't do their worst [to us] because someone, at some point, would be checking in on them."" Buck began using Twitter as a way to keep up in touch with the bloggers at the heart of his project and the events going on in Egypt that he intended to cover. Buck was working on a multimedia project on Egypt's ""new leftists and the blogosphere"" as part of his master's degree thesis. Buck found out from a Twitter message that a planned protest against rising food prices and decreasing wages in Mahalla had been shut down by Egyptian authorities April 6. The next day, tensions rose as family and friends of protesters who had been detained took to the streets, eventually throwing Molotov cocktails and setting tires on fire, he said. On April 10, Buck returned to Mahalla, where protests continued. ""I was worried about getting arrested, so I made sure to stay at a distance from the protest so there was no way I could be accused of being part of it,"" Buck said. ""Mohammed and I had a bad sense; it was really tense."" When the men tried to escape, they were detained. That's when Buck thought of Twitter and sent out his message. Buck and Maree were interrogated, released and then detained again by the same police officers. ""We are really worried that we are off the radar now,"" Buck said. Eventually Buck was released, but Maree was transferred to another police station. As he left the station, Buck reached into his pocket, as he did less than 24 hours earlier. Another one-word blog entry said it all: ""Free."" As happy as he was to be free, Buck said, his biggest frustration was leaving behind the translator who helped protect him during the riots. Although the Twitter message helped him find contacts to get out of prison, he says it was more the power of the network he had as an American that enabled him to be released so quickly. ""Mohammed was sitting next to me,"" he said. ""But he didn't have the network to call. I tried to use my network to shield him until they tore us apart."" Twitter may not have been able to secure Maree's release, but Buck hopes his initial reason for using Twitter will help find his missing friend. ""It was my big hope that people would get [the message] right away and at least put a thumbtack on the map as far as our location,"" Buck said. There has been no official confirmation regarding Maree's whereabouts. Attiya Shakran, press counsel for the Egyptian Consulate in San Francisco, said Maree was released April 13. Maree's brother Ahmed Maree said that he had not heard from his brother and that he believes he is still in jail. Government officials in Egypt could neither confirm nor deny Maree's release, despite repeated requests for comment. Buck is now using his story and Twitter page as a way to rally people looking for answers about Maree's status. He's gone as far as publishing the phone number of the press counsel of the Egyptian Consulate in San Francisco and posting a petition for Maree's release. For Buck, the main story is no longer about his quest for freedom from jail; it's a quest to find answers and, eventually, find his friend. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Liberia's chief medical officer is on a 21-day Ebola quarantine after her assistant died from the illness, according to health officials. The assistant died Thursday, prompting the closure of the the Ministry of Health headquarters building for decontamination, officials said. The ministry reopened on Friday, but Dr. Bernice T. Dahn entered a quarantine period, her deputy, Tolbert Nyenswah, said. The assistant showed symptoms of Ebola 10 days ago, officials said, but Dahn last had contact with him 13 days ago. An American doctor who volunteered in Sierra Leone and was exposed to Ebola will be admitted to the Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health in coming days, the NIH said in a statement.

The figures are based on information provided on September 23 by health ministries in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the countries most impacted by the Ebola outbreak. Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf told world leaders at the United Nations this week that at least 85 of Liberia's more than 1,700 Ebola victims were health care workers. The crisis is deteriorating Liberia's economy, she said. ""Partners and friends, based on understandable fear, have ostracized us; shipping and airline services have sanctioned us; and the world has taken some time to fully appreciate and adequately respond to the enormity of our tragedy,"" Sirleaf said.

"New York (CNN) -- The appearance of mysterious giant circles on an ice-covered pond has some upstate New York residents wondering if they've been visited by beings from another realm. During an unseasonable spring snow storm last Friday, Peggy Gervase of Eden was stunned to see the strange pattern that had formed on the pond she built 10 years ago behind her home. The large circles resembled a black and white Twister game. Gervase posted a photograph of the pond on Facebook, with a link to CNN affiliate WGRZ's Facebook page, and it received hundreds of comments speculating about what caused the phenomenon. ""People were suggesting all kinds of crazy stuff,"" Gervase told CNN. ""There was everything from ducks swimming in circles to bodies burning to Bigfoot."" She got a laugh out of one explanation in particular -- flatulent fish. And the most bizarre of all -- could there be aliens roaming around this quaint town south of Buffalo? It's likely a more mundane explanation, one expert says. ""There are lots of processes in nature that involve water and convection -- sometimes salt and fresh water, sometimes cold and warm water, sometimes a bit of both. The oceans do this at a range of scales, and it wouldn't surprise me if this is another one of those phenomena where water convects because of a subtle change in temperature,"" said Timothy Creyts, a glaciologist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University. Freeze and thaw cycles common at this time of year cause warm water to rise from the bottom of the pond, disrupting ice formation because of the water's temperature and motion. ""It isn't really a phenomenon. Pond circles are Mother Nature's artwork,"" Gervase said. ""But it took just one photo for people to go wild and then it had a life of its own."" Some scientists are glad the photo has caused such a commotion. ""Everyone who saw that photo and thought, 'I wonder how that happened?' was doing what scientists do every day,"" said Andrew Juhl, an associate professor at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. ""It's great that people pay attention to these kinds of events and use them to exercise their curiosity about the world around them.""","The circles appeared after a snowstorm last week, Peggy Gervase says .

"(CNN) -- Formula One drivers will get two points for the price of one at the final race of 2014 under new rules announced Monday. The victorious driver in the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix will now win 50 points compared to 25 points for each of the other 18 races. But former F1 race winner John Watson fears the idea of dishing out double points at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix is nothing more than a gimmick designed to manufacture a false climax to the season. ""This is a mechanism to try and alleviate the championship being won before the final round,"" Watson, who ended his F1 career with the McLaren team, told CNN. ""If someone is second and close to the race leader and there is a chance to overtake and eventually win the championship, that's what they're trying to achieve. ""The one thing that F1 does not need is the championship being won two or more races out. ""That just doesn't do F1, its audience and the people who are investing in that audience any good whatsoever. ""In 2012, when there were seven drivers winning the first races, the public enjoyed that and that's what they want to see. ""As much as they admire Red Bull and Vettel, it was entertaining motor racing and the early 2012 model (of competition) is what F1 should be trying to achieve. ""But all double points would have done in 2013 is to guarantee more points for Red Bull because they had already won the championship. ""The doubles point is a novelty more than anything else. The teams that are the most successful that season will benefit from it most. ""I might be proved wrong but it seems to me that this isn't a meaningful change. ""I think that's it's something done in haste in response to what we've seen this year."" Red Bull and Sebastian Vettel powered to the last four F1 world championships and in 2011 and 2013, the German driver wrapped up the titles with races to spare. In contrast, Vettel edged the 2010 and 2012 titles at the final race of the season and if the double points had been on offer in 2012 Ferrari's Fernando Alonso would have nicked the crown. But even the man who survived those nail-biting contests appears to be skeptical about plans to change the points system. German magazine Sport Bild confirmed to CNN that the four-time world champion had described the rule change in a telephone conversation to them as ""absurd"" and it would ""punish those who have worked hard for a whole season."" The FIA explained the rule changes in a statement which read: ""Double drivers' and constructors' points will be awarded at the final race of the Formula One season in order to maximize focus on the championship until the end of the campaign."" Double your money? End-of-season performance determines how F1's prize money is roughly divvied up between the teams. Each marque gets a share of the prize pot in relation to where it finished in the championship. Watson predicts that the new double points ruling could also have a negative impact on how this revenue is split. ""The problem is by the time you get to the end of the season the majority of the teams are bust,"" Watson continued. ""So, this is only going to play into the hands of the stronger teams. ""The days of a development push coming from anybody but the top three or four teams are gone. ""The teams with financial strength will no doubt get the funding to consolidate their positions. ""To me everything is virtually against the field at large with this regulation change. ""What remains to be seen is whether the FIA or (F1 chief executive) Bernie (Ecclestone) pay double for the final race."" A number of other rule changes came out of this week's FIA's World Motor Sport Council meeting in Paris. The sport's governing body renewed its plans to curb teams spending by announcing a global cost cap from January 2015. It did not, however, state what figure teams' spending would be capped at. Meanwhile, drivers will have to get their thinking caps on as, from 2014, they will be asked to choose a race number between two and 99 to use for the rest of their careers. No. 1 will be reserved for the reigning world champion and if more than one driver chooses the same number then priority will be given to the driver finishing higher in the previous world championship. Lotus racer Romain Grosjean has already asked his followers on Twitter to help him choose a number. The FIA also revealed that six teams -- Red Bull, Mercedes, Ferrari, McLaren, Force India and Toro Rosso -- have agreed to take part in a three-day tire test in Bahrain next week. F1 tire supplier Pirelli and Mercedes got into hot water earlier this year for taking part in a unsanctioned tire test. This month's tire test will be the first preparation for the major technical rule change that will reconfigure F1 in 2014 -- but the new points change in the final race could determine which team ends up winning the championship.","Formula One drivers and teams can win double points at 2014 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix .

"(CNN) -- Australian cricketer Phil Hughes is fighting for his life in hospital, a day after he was felled by a sickening blow from a ball during a televised match in Sydney. The 25-year-old batsman, who was playing for South Australia against New South Wales at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) Tuesday, collapsed after being struck by a ""bouncer"" from bowler Sean Abbott. After receiving treatment on the pitch, he was rushed to the city's St Vincent's Hospital, where he underwent neurosurgery. ""Phil remains in a critical condition in intensive care. He's in the hands of some of the best specialists available for this type of injury so we'll just wait and see,"" hospital spokesman David Faktor told CNN Wednesday. The ""bouncer,"" a delivery pitched short so it bounces up at the batsman's upper body, is a common tactic for bowlers to use in cricket. Nick Compton: Facing fear in cricket's fast lane . Head protection . But despite the accident to Hughes, who has played 26 Test matches for Australia, former England batsman Nick Compton said he does not think cricket has a problem with head protection. ""It's awkward, it's part of the game. For the bowler, it's not his fault. It's one of those freak accidents,"" said the 31 year old, who played with Hughes at English county Middlesex in 2009. ""On another day, you do exactly the same thing and it glances off your helmet, you get a bit of a bruise, you feel a bit 'ugh' and that's about it. Every batsman has been hit at some point, some worse than others. It's worrying. ""It's the unpredictability of sport, that's what makes it what it is. It's a tough one to get right. If you want an absolutely risk-free occupation, don't play sport. ""The helmets these days are very well made. It's hit him in an absolute freak place."" He added that the hot, dry conditions of an Australian summer create hard pitches, which suit fast bowlers. But Australian sports commentator Peter FitzSimons said the sport should look again at the welfare of its players even if it was a ""freak accident."" ""The cricket world should be looking for the helmet to cover the side and back of the neck -- even the ears,"" he told CNN Wednesday. ""This could be uncomfortable for the cricketers but it should be considered. If you have to choose between discomfort and risking death, many will choose discomfort."" Meanwhile, messages of support poured in from across the sporting world and beyond. ""All thoughts are with Phil Hughes and his family,"" tweeted former England all-rounder Ian Botham.

"(CNN) -- One mall Santa might be getting some coal in his stocking this year. Last week, Santa Claus and a helper elf from The Shops at Mission Viejo in California turned away a 7-year-old girl with autism and her service dog, a pit bull named Pup-Cake. According to the Orange County Register, Abcde Santos, who pronounces her first name ""ab-suh-dee,"" and Pup-Cake stood in line for 30 minutes to meet with the unnamed mall Santa. But he declined to meet the girl because he feared the 5-year-old pit bull. ""After the Santos family offered to remove the dog from the area, the building, Santa still refused to see the child,"" Julie Miller, a family friend who runs a Facebook page dedicated to Pup-Cake and service animals, told the Register. ""Autism is accompanied by many sensory issues, included self-harm behaviors and feeling overwhelmed at times by lights, sounds, especially when waiting,"" according to the dog's Facebook page. ""Pup-cake the service dog's job is to intervene in those moments."" Word of the diss led to a viral campaign, #savePupcakesChristmas, with sympathizers angered over the incident posting comments on the Facebook page for The Shops at Mission Viejo. The mall posted a statement that said, ""We share in your concerns regarding the situation today involving a Santa at The Shops at Mission Viejo. We do not condone the behavior displayed by Santa and have worked with our partners at Noerr, the company that hires our Santas, to replace this Santa with one that is more compassionate to our guests' needs."" It later shared a note from Miller about how property management and the mall had moved swiftly to correct the Bad Santa problem. The mall added, ""We look forward to welcoming back the Santos family and Pup-Cake for a special Santa experience."" A representative for the Noerr Programs, which provided the Santa and helper, said the pair have been transferred and given other duties. ""For 26 years, The Noerr Programs has devoted itself to sharing the heart of Santa through the creation of magical Christmas experiences for all children and their families,"" CEO Judy Noerr said in a statement. ""The entire team at The Noerr Programs sincerely apologizes for any distress caused by this situation, and truly regrets the incident. We have reached out to the girl's family, in an effort to extend a private Santa visit with complimentary photos of both the child and her service dog."" The Santos family has declined to be interviewed. Miller told the paper the family is pleased with the decision to replace the Santa and hopes it will lead to better awareness.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A new robotic suit could transform the lives of paralyzed people, giving them the ability to walk again. A lightweight robotic suit can help some wheelchair users walk. The invention, known as ReWalk, acts like a kind of exoskeleton. It consists of lightweight, motorized leg supports and an assortment of intricate motion sensors. Users wear a backpack that holds a computerized control box which helps the medical device recognize when a step needs to be taken. ""Standing changes my whole environment. I don't have to look from the bottom up. Now I am eye to eye with everybody,"" Radi Kaiof, who has used the device, told CNN. Kaiof, a former Israeli soldier, was paralyzed from the waist down 20 years ago. He doesn't have feeling in his legs but is still able to move with the use of the robotic suit.  Watch Kaiof walk with the assistance of the suit » . With the assistance of crutches, which offer balance and support, people paralyzed from the waist down can walk, bend, sit and even climb stairs when they wear the suit. The futuristic invention offers an alternative to using a wheelchair for those who have functioning upper bodies and are capable of standing with the use of supports. It is the creation of Dr. Amit Goffer, an engineer and founder of Haifa, Israel-based high-tech firm Argo Medical Technologies. Goffer was inspired to create the device more than a decade ago after he became disabled in an accident. The medical technology that could help paraplegics do what was once considered impossible isn't available for purchase yet. The device wasn't ready for testing until late 2007 and currently is in clinical trials in Tel Aviv. More trials are planned for the United States and Europe, and if the product receives the necessary approvals, it could hit the market in 2010. The price of the device hasn't been set yet, but is expected to be comparable with the typical average yearly expense of using a wheelchair. The robotic suit improves the quality of life of people paralyzed from the waist down, according to Goffer, who wanted to give paraplegics an alternative to using a wheelchair. It also benefits their overall health since it keeps their bodies active all day long, he says. But when it comes down to it, the invention is all about helping people regain respect. Dignity is ""the No. 1 problem"" for people who use wheelchairs, says Goffer. For Kaiof, the former soldier, the robotic suit has changed his life. Before he tried it on, his daughter had never seen him stand before. When he stood before her for the first time, she couldn't believe just how tall he was, he recounted to CNN.","Robotic suit developed in Israel helps paraplegics walk again .

"People with Parkinson's disease who have a pacemaker-like device implanted in the brain spend an extra four-plus hours a day free of tremors and involuntary movements than they do on medication, according to the largest study of the treatment, which is known as deep brain stimulation. In deep brain stimulation, electrodes deliver impulses to the substantia nigra, which coordinates movement. However, deep brain stimulation also has a correspondingly greater risk of problems, such as infection, because of the complicated surgery, according to the study published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. ""It definitely is brain surgery and that should give anyone pause,"" says David Charles, M.D., of Vanderbilt University, in Nashville, Tennessee, who was not involved in the new study. Nevertheless, he adds, most of the problems seen in the study were related to the surgery itself, and many had resolved themselves within six months. The findings are ""encouraging,"" he says, given that previous research has suggested that patients might develop much more serious problems, such as major depression and suicidal thoughts, than were seen in the current study. Health.com: My life with Parkinson's . In deep brain stimulation, electrodes are used to deliver electrical impulses to the substantia nigra, a crescent-shaped region in the center of the brain that controls and coordinates movement. In patients with Parkinson's disease, dopamine-producing nerve cells in this region degenerate, causing tremors, stiffness, slowed movement, and loss of coordination. Drugs such as levodopa can help reduce tremors and involuntary movements. But for many people, this medication loses its effectiveness over time, while the side effects -- such as sudden jerky movements, chewing motions, and hand tremors -- get worse. Introduced in the late 1990s, deep brain stimulation is becoming more widely accepted to treat such patients. But most studies have not been conducted in a way to clearly demonstrate the risks and benefits compared with medication alone. In the new study, a team led by Frances Weaver, Ph.D., director of the Center for Management of Complex Chronic Care at the Hines VA Hospital, in Hines, Illinois, randomly assigned 255 Parkinson's patients to deep brain stimulation or medical therapy, which could include physical therapy, medication, and other appropriate treatment. A quarter of the patients were older than 70. Six months after treatment, the deep brain stimulation patients reported about 4.6 more hours a day of ""on"" time, meaning time without movement problems; those in the control group showed no ""on"" time improvement. In all, 71 percent of the deep brain stimulation patients had improvements in their motor function, compared to 32 percent of the medical therapy patients. When Parkinson's patients start a new drug, Weaver notes, they will see at best an hour or two more of ""on"" time a day. ""It's huge, and more than that, it's consistent with what other studies are finding too,"" says Charles. ""It's a large study at multiple centers with lots of patients and it's done in a very rigorous manner."" Charles is conducting a clinical trial of deep brain stimulation in patients with very early Parkinson's disease, which, like Weaver's research, is partially funded by the company that makes the stimulation device -- Medtronic. Charles has served as faculty for Medtronic educational programs and consulted with the company, as did one researcher on the JAMA study. Overall, deep brain stimulation patients were nearly four times as likely to have serious post-surgery problems, such as infections, disorders of the nervous system, or psychiatric problems. Ten percent of surgery patients developed infections in the surgical site, and one person died. Serious falls also were more common among deep brain stimulation patients during the six months after surgery. People who had deep brain stimulation were also more likely to develop depression, confusion, and anxiety, although these changes were minor, according to Weaver and her colleagues, and it's not yet clear how much of an effect they had on patients. Health.com: Natural cures for depression . The surgery is extremely complex, Weaver notes; first, patients must have the electrodes implanted in the brain, which has to happen while they are awake so the surgeon can test the effects of touching various brain regions in order to make sure they are putting the device in the right place. Then patients undergo surgery to implant the pacing device, usually in the chest, which must be done under general anesthesia. If a patient develops an infection, it may be necessary to remove the device and replace it with a new one. The fact that the study included a relatively high number of people over 70 may have contributed to the high rate of adverse events, Weaver explains. But the benefits seen for patients -- including the older people, who fared as well as the younger patients -- are ""great news,"" Charles says. Anyone considering deep brain stimulation should keep these risks in mind and work with his or her physician to determine if the benefits will outweigh these relatively rare -- but significant -- dangers, Weaver advises. More than 1 million people in the United States have Parkinson's disease, and 50,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. Actor Michael J. Fox is arguably the most famous person with the disease; his was diagnosed in 1991. Health.com: Michael J. Fox keeps up the fight . In 1998, Fox underwent a type of brain surgery called a thalamotomy, in which a tiny portion of brain tissue is destroyed. This type of surgery gives a similar result to deep brain stimulation, but is not reversible. With deep brain stimulation, doctors can halt the electrical impulses if necessary. More than 35,000 deep brain stimulation procedures have been performed around the world, according to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, and the procedure is being studied as a treatment for depression and other conditions as well.

"(CNN) -- Two years ago next week, Superstorm Sandy barreled through parts of the United States, causing $65 billion worth of damage to communities up and down the Eastern seaboard. Sandy, which brought extensive flooding to New York and Atlantic City, was described by many as a once in a generation storm. But in the coming years, thanks to global warming, it won't take superstorms like Sandy to bring regular and potentially dangerous flooding to parts of the United States. Tidal flooding used to be a relatively rare occurrence along the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico, generally happening only occasionally at high tide or king tide, when the sun and the moon are aligned. But based on what scientists already know about climate change, it is clear that sea levels are going to rise over the next few decades. Coastal flooding is expected to occur even more often and cause more disruption. This will redefine how and where coastal residents live, work, and go about their daily routines. High tides are having a greater impact now for two reasons. First, our coasts are more heavily developed, so higher tides affect more people and infrastructure. Second, these tides are now occurring along with elevated -- and rising -- sea levels. Global sea levels rose approximately 8 inches from 1880 to 2009 as global warming hastened land-based ice melt, and seawater expanded as it absorbed heat from a warming atmosphere. Sea level rise worldwide is now accelerating, and at an especially fast rate along parts of the East Coast. This reality is captured in a report we co-authored earlier this month, analyzing how often flooding occurs at 52 sites along the Eastern seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico and estimating the frequency and extent of flooding over the next 15 and 30 years. We found that many East Coast communities now experience dozens of tidal floods every year. In some places, there has been a fourfold increase in the number of days per year with tidal flooding since 1970. When tidal floods occur, water can cover roads for hours, making passage risky or even impossible, trapping residents in their homes. Sometimes this is just a short-lived nuisance, requiring traffic detours. But sometimes floods can compromise evacuation routes -- a particular problem when public safety and commerce in some coastal communities, such as those that dot the Outer Banks in North Carolina, depend on just one or two access routes. So what can we do? In the short term, municipalities, counties and states have to clear flooded coastal roads and repair damage from erosion and overwash. But over the long term, ""in many cases, they are going to have to raise the roads on their existing path,"" according to Steve Miller at the Great Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve in New Hampshire. ""Money is a big question."" Retail stores, restaurants and public infrastructure clustered in low-lying waterfront areas are also threatened by tidal flooding. South Florida has been particularly hard-hit. Tidal flooding ""has really affected our business,"" noted Bobby Thakore, owner of the Taste Bakery CafÃ© on Alton Road in Miami Beach and one of the many people we spoke with when compiling our report. ""We are down 15 percent on revenue during flooding, and in the past year construction [to address flooding] mixed with the flooding and has made our revenue loss worse."" Using a midrange estimate for future sea level rise, we found that more than half of the 52 communities we analyzed can expect to average more than two dozen tidal floods per year by 2030. The rise in the frequency of tidal flooding represents an extremely steep increase for some, and two-thirds could experience at least three times more high-tide floods every year. We expect the Mid-Atlantic coast to see some of the biggest increases in flood frequency. Because many communities are already coping with tidal floods, a tripling in their frequency would mean they could occur more than four times a month by 2030. Annapolis, Maryland, and Washington, D.C., for example, can expect to average more than 150 tidal floods a year, and several New Jersey locations could suffer 80 tidal floods or more annually. By 2045, many coastal communities likely will experience a sea level rise of about a foot. As that occurs, a third of the 52 locations in our analysis would begin to average more than 180 tidal floods a year. And nine locations, including Atlantic City and Cape May in New Jersey, can expect tidal floods 240 times or more per year. Without sensible preparation, daily life in low-lying areas along the East and Gulf coasts will become at best risky and at worst dangerous. Coastal communities -- and state and federal agencies -- have to start planning today to cope with unprecedented tidal flooding and take precautions to limit longer-term damage. Communities need to flood-proof homes, neighborhoods and sewer and stormwater infrastructure and limit new development in flood-prone areas. Federal and state governments, meanwhile, need to monitor sea level rise and flooding, provide funding and other resources for local resilience-building efforts, reform flood insurance programs, and -- most importantly -- address the root of the problem. Sadly, the reality is that the near-term increase in sea level and tidal flooding may be unavoidable. But if states and the federal governments take concerted action to dramatically reduce carbon emissions, then we can at least avoid the worst consequences of global warming.","Global sea levels rose about 8 inches from 1880 to 2009, says science group .

"(CNN) -- Talk radio host Dr. Laura Schlessinger has issued an apology for saying the N-word several times during an on-air conversation with a caller this week. ""I talk every day about doing the right thing. And yesterday, I did the wrong thing,"" Schlessinger said on her radio show Wednesday. ""I was attempting to make a philosophical point, and I articulated the n-word all the way out -- more than one time. And that was wrong. I'll say it again -- that was wrong."" Schlessinger was referring to a call she got on her show Tuesday from an African-American woman who said she was married to a white man and was getting fed up with her husband allowing his family and friends to say things that she felt were racist. Schlessinger asked the woman to give her some examples and then said that she thought the examples the woman gave were not racist. The woman then asked about the use of the n-word. Schlessinger said ""black guys use it all the time. Turn on HBO, listen to a black comic, and all you hear is n---, n----, n----."" The talk show host went on to use the word at least three more times during the call. Schlessinger and the caller began bickering back and forth toward the end of the call, and the caller said she was upset that the talk show host had used the word. Schlessinger suggested that the caller was hypersensitive. ""If you're that hypersensitive about color and don't have a sense of humor, don't marry out of your race,"" the talk show host said. iReporter: ""Dr. Laura, thanks for opening the debate"" The Rev. Al Sharpton decried the incident during an interview with ""AC 360"" on Thursday. ""That is despicable,"" Sharpton said about Schlessinger's comment about the caller marrying outside of her race. ""She said the word over and over, and in a very animated way, I might add, but that she actually, if you listen carefully to the logic of what she was saying was that the n-word was not offensive.""","Talk show host says using the word was wrong .

"Washington (CNN) -- Attorney General Eric Holder announced Monday that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other 9/11 terror suspects will face a military trial at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility in Cuba. The decision is a sharp reversal for the Obama administration, which wanted the terror suspects to have federal civilian trials. Besides Mohammed, the other suspects to face charges of participating in the 9/11 plot are Walid bin Attash, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, Ali Abdul Aziz Ali and Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi. All five are at Guantanamo. In announcing his decision, Holder blasted Congress for imposing restrictions on the Justice Department's ability to bring the men to New York for civilian trials -- a course of action he promised in 2009. ""After thoroughly studying the case, it became clear to me that the best venue for prosecution was in federal court. I stand by that decision today,"" Holder said. ""As the president has said, those unwise and unwarranted restrictions (imposed by Congress) undermine our counterterrorism efforts and could harm our national security. Decisions about who, where and how to prosecute have always been -- and must remain -- the responsibility of the executive branch."" Holder insisted, ""We were prepared to bring a powerful case against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and his four co-conspirators -- one of the most well-researched and documented cases I have ever seen in my decades of experience as a prosecutor."" He added, ""Had this case proceeded in Manhattan or in an alternative venue in the United States, as I seriously explored in the past year, I am confident that our justice system would have performed with the same distinction that has been its hallmark for over 200 years."" Holder had promised to seek the death penalty for each of the five men. He warned Monday that it is an ""open question"" if such a penalty can be imposed by a military commission if the defendants plead guilty. He expressed confidence in the military, however, to conduct ""fair trials"" and deliver ""just verdicts."" President Barack Obama's primary concern is that the accused perpetrators ""be brought to justice as swiftly as possible,"" White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters. Holder's plan to hold a nonmilitary trial had been sharply criticized by both Republican leaders and key members of the New York congressional delegation. Among other things, critics cited cost and security concerns tied to a trial in Manhattan. They also argued that the suspects -- who are not American citizens -- should not receive the rights and protections provided to defendants in civilian courts. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said in a written statement that it is ""unfortunate that it took the Obama administration more than two years to figure out what the majority of Americans already know: that 9/11 conspirator Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is not a common criminal, he's a war criminal."" Rep. Peter King, R-New York, head of the House Homeland Security Committee, called the decision a ""long-awaited step in the right direction."" ""These terror trials belong in a military commission at Guantanamo,"" he said. The decision is a ""vindication of President (George W.) Bush's detention policies."" New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said it's ""more appropriate"" for the trials to be held in a ""secure area."" ""What I've read about military tribunals is they're not an automatic kind of thing,"" he said. ""They are a different form of a legal system, but something that this country can implement and not be ashamed of."" Holder said he respects the different views expressed in Congress and elsewhere, but insisted he is in a better position to make the final decision. ""I know this case in a way that members of Congress do not,"" he said. ""Do I know better than them? Yes."" A number of Democrats and civil liberties activists have expressed dismay at the idea of holding military trials, warning that such a move represents a dangerous breakdown in the U.S. judicial system. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the decision was disappointing in light of the fact that the U.S. justice system is ""the envy of the world."" ""Federal courts have convicted hundreds of terrorists,"" he noted. ""When Americans are murdered on American soil, we should not be afraid to bring those responsible for those heinous acts to justice in American courts."" Mason Clutter, an attorney with the progressive Constitution Project, said his organization is ""extremely disappointed by the administration's decision to try what is arguably the most important criminal case the U.S. has ever seen in an untested and flawed system instead of in our legitimate criminal justice system."" ""Our civilian justice system has a proven capacity to handle complex terrorism cases,"" Clutter said. ""Today's decision will only continue to delay justice for the victims of 9/11 and their families."" Hina Shamsi, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's National Security Project, called the decision ""a devastating blow to the rule of law."" ""Cases prosecuted by (military commissions) now are sure to be subject to continuous legal challenges and delays, and their outcomes will not be seen as legitimate. Americans deserve better than this, and the world expects more of us."" A senior defense official told CNN, ""We weren't out advocating for this decision. But we do have a court system (at Guantanamo Bay) that is both prepared to handle, and is already handling, people accused of crimes relating to terrorism."" The official said a lack of funding from Congress on more permanent detainment options for terrorist suspects within the continental United States ""left the Justice Department short on options."" Obama promised to shut down the Guantanamo Bay detention facility within a year of taking office -- a promise he was unable to keep in the face of congressional resistance. Holder promised Monday that the administration will continue working to shut down the facility and lift the restrictions on civilian trials imposed by Congress. CNN's Ted Barrett, Carol Cratty, Terry Frieden and Ed Henry contributed to this report .","The decision is a reversal for the Obama administration, which had wanted civilian trials .

"Washington (CNN) -- Sen. Mark Udall accused the CIA of ""lying"" about the effectiveness of torture, called for the resignation of its director and blasted President Barack Obama's handling of the spy agency on the Senate floor Wednesday. In a 48-minute speech, the Colorado Democrat called on Obama to ""purge his administration"" of CIA officials, including Director John Brennan, involved in the interrogation techniques detailed in a new Senate Intelligence Committee report. He also revealed what he called the ""key findings and conclusions"" of an internal CIA review commissioned by former director Leon Panetta -- which the Obama administration has not publicly released. ""Director Brennan and the CIA today are continuing to willfully provide inaccurate information and misrepresent the efficacy of torture,"" Udall said. ""In other words: The CIA is lying."" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest defended Brennan on Wednesday, telling reporters that he has done an ""exemplary job"" and that Obama is ""pleased to rely on his advice."" Udall's comments came the day after Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) released an explosive report detailing the rough techniques the CIA used to interrogate detainees under President George W. Bush. The report suggests those techniques -- including mock executions, sleep deprivation, beating detainees, feeding them rectally and threatening the lives of their families -- produced faulty intelligence. It also said the CIA misled Congress and the White House. But Brennan pushed back, acknowledging in a statement that the CIA made ""mistakes"" but saying those techniques ""did produce intelligence that helped thwart attack plans, capture terrorists, and save lives. The intelligence gained from the program was critical to our understanding of al-Qa'ida and continues to inform our counterterrorism efforts to this day."" Udall -- who lost his re-election bid in November and is leaving office in just weeks -- said he was frustrated with those comments Wednesday, and repeated his previous call for Brennan's resignation. He also accused Obama of failing to live up to his pledges during the 2008 campaign to be more transparent about the use of torture. And he said the CIA's internal Panetta review's findings reveal that the White House is misleading the public. ""One would think this administration is leading the effort to right the wrongs of the past and ensure the American people learn the truth about the CIA's torture program,"" Udall said. ""Not so. It's been nearly a six-year struggle in a Democratic administration to get this study out. For a while I worried that this administration would succeed in keeping this study entirely under wraps. ""While the study clearly shows that the CIA detention and interrogation program itself was deeply flawed, the deeper, more endemic problem lies in the CIA, assisted by a White House that continues to try to cover up the truth.""","Sen.

"(CNN) -- Despite the excitement over the royal tour of New Zealand and Australia, the commonly held view of politicians in both countries appears to be that the writing is on the wall for the reach of Britain's monarchy to its far-flung South Pacific realms. The Queen's official representative in Australia last year expressed support for replacing the monarch with an elected head of state, while New Zealand's ex-foreign minister and former head of the Commonwealth has said the country is ""inching towards republicanism."" But how inevitable is it really that Australia and New Zealand will abandon their monarch to become republics? Despite the view of the political classes in both countries, republicanism seems to be in reversal. This year Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott restored knights and dames after nearly 30 years, bestowing titles on the incoming and outgoing governors-general. New Zealand Prime Minister John Key restored titular honors in 2009 after they had been abolished by a Labour government in 2000. Neither of these prime ministers will create a republic. As in Britain, fondness for the monarchy has grown with the Queen's Jubilee and the popularity of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and baby Prince George, whose attractiveness is refreshing monarchism. Prince William has already reinforced loyalties in Australia and New Zealand with his visits to comfort embattled communities after the disasters of earthquakes in Christchurch and floods in Brisbane. There are differences between Australia and New Zealand, however. The republican movement was, and is, stronger in Australia. Empire status . To understand why, we need to turn to history. For a start, Australia was more Irish. Transportation of thousands of convicts to the Australian colonies did not lend itself to devotion to the sovereign. So it is unsurprising that Australia developed a nationalist republican tradition, expressed by the ""Bulletin"" magazine from the 1880s -- with the motto ""Australia for the Australians"" -- that opposed the monarchy. National hero Henry Lawson's first published poem, ""A Song of the Republic,"" sought freedom from the ""wrongs of the North and Past."" But no cleavage of loyalty threatened the imperial connection when Australia became a nation in 1901, and republican radicals remained in the minority. Membership of the empire conveyed a sense of pomp, pride and greatness in both countries. New Zealand decided its status within the empire would be grander by staying separate from Australia. Historically New Zealand was the more loyal dominion, and more economically dependent until Britain joined the EEC, a move that did not help monarchism. In 1911, New Zealand borrowed to build a battleship for the Royal Navy, whereas Australia established its own navy; and New Zealand introduced conscription in the First World War whereas Australia did not. New Zealand was last to sign the Statute of Westminster in 1947. It was not until 1986 that New Zealand finally removed the United Kingdom's residual powers to make law for New Zealand under a Constitution Act. Colonization and honors . New Zealand Maori play an important part in the country's position on the monarchy. There is no equivalent voice for Aborigines with their harsher experience of colonization. The status of the Treaty of Waitangi, signed in 1840, is central in the New Zealand case, whereby the chiefs ceded government to the Queen of England in return for her protection. Ever since, ""the Crown"" has been of supreme importance to Maori. Australia was first to introduce a republican-style honors system in 1975, including the Order of Australia. Again, a reformist Labor government made the change. Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, who led the initiative, joked that the only imperial honor he ever awarded was a damehood to Dame Edna Everage -- the character created by cross-dressing Australian comedian Barry Humphries. For a while national and imperial honors systems overlapped and the Australian States continued to use imperial honors until the end of the 1980s. The Order of New Zealand was introduced by a reformist Labour government in 1987. The remainder of the New Zealand honors system, however, had to wait until 1996. Jim Bolger, the then National (non-Labour) prime minister, is a republican, and his stance prompted the creation of a Monarchist League of New Zealand. Bolger denies that his Irish background explains his republicanism. Constitutional change . Both Australia and New Zealand founded republican movements in the 1990s to act as lobby groups advocating constitutional change, the New Zealand one based on the Australian model. But in New Zealand opinion has been more evenly split between republicanism and support for a constitutional monarchy. Recent polls put republican views in the minority, at about a third. Australia differed from New Zealand in holding a referendum on becoming a republic in 1999, despite the prime minister's monarchism and a divided Liberal Party. The Labor Party was near-unanimous in favor. In the event the people voted ""no,"" because republicans were divided over how the president would be appointed. The referendum provided for appointment by parliament, when many favored a directly elected president. Distrust of politicians decided the result. The monarch's popularity is a critical factor. Nothing is likely to happen in either country while the Queen is alive, except perhaps the design of the flags currently being waved at the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. As for baby Prince George, support for his position as future heir to the thrones of Australia and New Zealand may be dictated in part by the sustainability of his -- and his parents' -- celebrity status. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Philippa Mein Smith.","Republicanism in Australian and NZ seems to be in reversal, says Philippa Mein Smith .
Mein Smith says neither country's current prime minister will create a republic .
But she says the two countries' positions differ, with NZ historically the more loyal .
Australians' vote not to become a republic was in part due to distrust of politicians, she says ."
"(CNN) -- The end of the Earth. That's how an official Mexican tourism website describes Los Cabos. For 27-year-old Kate Pope, the popular beach travel destination on the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula felt like just that after Hurricane Odile hit Sunday night. ""The hotel gates are chained shut and there are guards with batons for security,"" Pope said. ""Resorts are a good target once the grocery stores are depleted."" More than 1,000 miles away, her fiance, William Wilcox, was frantic. Pope had traveled to Cabo San Lucas from California for a bachelorette celebration with her sisters and friends. For days, Wilcox hadn't heard from them -- until Wednesday morning, when he learned that instead of partying at beachside bars, the group had huddled for 14 hours in a hotel basement and then later spent the night in soaked beds in a flooded room. The hotel employees asked them to turn all flashlights off and keep quiet so they did not attract the masses roaming the streets, Pope said. ""People are still stuck,"" Wilcox wrote in a Twitter post Thursday. With communication still spotty, he says he's not sure where Pope is, but he hopes she's on a bus on the way to the airport. It's a harrowing situation that's left the resort region paralyzed long after the storm hit. Authorities said thousands of tourists were trapped after the storm left airports unable to reopen. Mexican military aircraft began transporting passengers from the region Tuesday. By Thursday, the country's transportation ministry said 18,000 people had been flown out on more than 120 military and commercial flights. ""The great majority of stranded tourists have been evacuated,"" the ministry said, adding that efforts will continue until all the affected travelers are transported. On Thursday afternoon, an emergency message from the U.S. Embassy advised U.S. citizens in the area to go as soon as possible to the airport in San Jose del Cabo, where the State Department was working with U.S. and Mexican carriers to arrange flights. ""Passengers should be prepared to wait until they are able to depart,"" the statement said. By Thursday evening, there were still thousands of tourists trying to get out of the area. A line at the airport stretched for more than a kilometer. Out of contact for days . But several family members of tourists vacationing in Mexico told CNN they're still waiting to find out how their loved ones fared. It took Elizabeth Vasquez of Concord, California, days to hear from her daughter after Odile pounded Puerto Los Cabos. ""Mom I can hear the wind now,"" Lisa Vasquez wrote in a text as the storm hit. ""I hear all kinds of things hitting the building."" Not long after that message, any word from the daughter ceased. On Thursday, Lisa Vasquez and her fiance Tomas were back in the United States at a Dallas airport trying to get a flight home to California. And they were back in touch with family. Georgia Demet-Mangiameli says two of her sons were stranded in Cabo San Lucas after heading there for a destination wedding. ""It's very disturbing. ... In the United States, there is the Red Cross which gets people out of harm's way instantly and there in Mexico they have just been sitting there for days since Sunday,"" she said. ""The conditions are horrible. They are running out of food, water and toilet paper,"" Demet-Mangiameli told CNN. ""They are worried about looters."" 'It just hit like a pile driver' In four years of living in Cabo San Lucas, Justin Dow said he'd never seen anything like it. ""It just hit like a pile driver. It was so vicious that the house was shaking. The noises were so scary,"" Dow said, describing his experience hearing the storm hit. ""The entire downstairs had at least an inch or more of water. You could just hear the destruction outside."" Now, Dow said, the town he calls home has drastically transformed. ""It is complete and utter devastation. They are looting everything,"" he said. ""There needs to be a lot done."" On Thursday, Mexican President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto said officials were creating a temporary work program to clean up damaged areas and community kitchens to help residents in the most severely impacted areas, state media reported. But Dow, originally from St. Simons Island, Georgia, said government officials in Mexico didn't react quickly or strongly enough to the devastating storm and its aftermath. He and his wife managed to evacuate on Wednesday afternoon, flying to San Diego with their dogs Sofi and Partner sitting at their feet. Dow says he can't shake the thought of the people left behind. ""Humans become desperate, and desperation turns into bad things,"" he said. ""So many people are still there, so many people that can't leave."" CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet, Carma Hassan, Krupskaia Alis and Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.","Military and commercial aircraft have evacuated 18,000 tourists, officials say .

"Washington (CNN) -- Jim DeMint may be long gone from the Senate and now running the conservative Heritage Foundation, but his blessing is still in demand for Republican presidential candidates marching through his home state of South Carolina. Even out of office, DeMint keeps counsel with a small but loyal network of Republican donors in South Carolina, an influential collection of business leaders and former state GOP chairmen who have relationships across the state's political spectrum. During the 2012 presidential race, the DeMint donors flirted with endorsing a presidential candidate and invited the cast of Republican contenders to a quasi-debate, the ""Palmetto Freedom Forum,"" in Columbia. Despite the attention showered upon him, DeMint ultimately stayed neutral in that primary. His allies, meanwhile, splintered among various campaigns. This time around, Marco Rubio is hoping to make an early good impression. The Florida senator, whose rise in the tea party-fueled 2010 election was due, in part, to DeMint's early endorsement, has quietly arranged to headline a private fundraiser in Greenville next month for the group's think tank, the Palmetto Policy Forum, a Republican source familiar with the plans told CNN. Hambycast: Branstad's mustachioed superstition exposed . The pending visit makes him the first likely Republican contender to come knocking on the DeMint crew's door. Details of the event have yet to be sorted out, but it will take place on October 22, just a day before Rubio mentor Jeb Bush, another possible 2016 candidate from Florida, will host a re-election fundraiser in Columbia for Gov. Nikki Haley. Rubio is also planning to attend a grassroots fund-raiser for the South Carolina Republican Party in Columbia alongside Sen. Tim Scott, the man who replaced DeMint in the Senate. With a team of political advisers that includes Terry Sullivan, a strategist who labored in the trenches of South Carolina politics for over a decade, Rubio has started to put in serious facetime with the state's conservative community as he builds a case for the Republican nomination in 2016. Rubio was last in the state in August, when he tangled with a group of ""DREAMers"" who crashed a conservative barbecue in Anderson and loudly criticized the senator for turning his back on a comprehensive immigration reform bill. On that same trip, he held court with a group of social conservative leaders at the Greenville home of Lisa van Riper, the president of South Carolina Citizens For Life. He also met privately with officials from Bob Jones University.","Marco Rubio is meeting with influential conservatives in South Carolina .

"(CNN)  -- When I first heard of Justin.tv, I was insanely jealous. The idea was so brain-dead simple that a lot of people -- including me -- wondered how we hadn't come up with it first. A self-admitted tech geek, Chris Pirillo is president of Lockergnome.com, a blogging network. Nowadays, Justin.tv is a bustling hub of streaming video channels broadcast and viewed by dozens of thousands. But at its humble beginning only a few short years ago, it was really just one guy (Justin Kan) walking around San Francisco with a webcam strapped to his head. It ran for 24 hours, seven days a week (barring technical difficulties), whether he was being interviewed by NPR or chowing down on a salad. It was like the ""show about nothing"" concept pitched by George Costanza and Jerry Seinfeld and made real -- and it took off instantly. I guess it's like television or the rest of the Web: If someone is interested enough to do it, someone else will be interested enough to view it. One might wonder about the sort of people so easily drawn into following such an experiment, but there were tons of us. Yes, I say ""us"" because I have to count myself among its first flock of fans. An unedited, human-eyed peek into the life of another person? Color me fascinated! It reminds me of how we'd sit glued to MTV in the '80s because, even if we weren't interested in what was on at that very moment, we were constantly in suspense of what might come next. Even if you weren't all that interested in going round n' round with Ratt, you might hang out for a while to watch Thomas Dolby get blinded with science. Anything could happen. But suspense is only part of the equation when trying to make sense of the phenomenon that is reality entertainment. I think part of the appeal is that it inspires us with the feeling that we, too, can create and participate. It's an unscripted exercise ripe with the potential for adventure. You don't have to be an award-winning playwright for a crack at having your voice heard by a sizeable audience. A tiny green fellow I once knew would be proud that it's become more popular to ""do"" than to ""not do"" or -- worse -- ""try."" Ah, Kermit. I wonder what he's up to these days? Thus inspired, like many of you out there, I'm one of those people who took the initiative and decided to give this ""lifecasting"" thing a go. Much of my day is spent in front of a Web cam, interacting with my viewers in an IRC chat room. We throw ideas around (usually tech-related, but conversation can meander off into matters of pet care and the intricacies of quantum knitting. You just never know) and I try to help people solve the computer problems that make them go ""hmmm."" Over the years, I've found that troubleshooting is something I'm good at doing. Being available on the Web for hours every day lets me help more people than I would have been able to even just a few short years ago. Best of all? I like to do it! In another age, I could have been a black-lunged coal miner or a scurvy-withered prison ship navigator. Yeah, I think I'll count my 21st-century blessings. My joy at having found a calling in the modern world must carry across to computer monitors around the globe, because I'm constantly being asked by my viewers how they, too, can get their foot in the lifecasting door. The will's way's been paved; technology has adapted along with lifecasting's popularity and it's actually easier than ever to get started. All you need is a webcam, a microphone, and an Internet connection. Many live streaming services are free for personal use, though don't rule out pre-recording videos when you're starting out to get the hang of things before making the plunge into 100% live lifecasting. I'm not trying to discourage anyone from jumping right in with both feet, but some people find comfort in cultivating their front-of-the-camera craft before going public, and that's fine. Build your self-confidence and mind your mannerisms, but always expect the unexpected. You will get caught off guard now and again, regardless of how much preparation you think you've done -- and that's fine, too. It'll thicken your skin. Interact with your viewers. This will thicken your skin even more, but you might be surprised at how supportive people can be if they like what you're doing. Think about broadcasting social events, but always get permission. Don't shove a camera in someone's face if they're not expecting it. If you're not intimidated by any of this, then go ahead and give lifecasting a try. Have a reason to do it, even if it's personal. Don't be afraid to be yourself. Most important: Have fun, and don't take yourself too seriously.","Tech enthusiast Chris Pirillo shares tips for ""lifecasting"" your daily doings on the Web .

"(CNN) -- An alleged commander for the Taliban and affiliated Haqqani network appeared in a U.S. court Tuesday to face a host of charges -- from supporting terrorism to attempted murder of an American citizen -- tied to a 2009 attack in Afghanistan. Irek Ilgiz Hamidullin was in a federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, just outside of Washington, on Tuesday, less than a month after his indictment and on the same day that the charging document against him was released. His arraignment is scheduled for Friday, according to the Department of Justice. According to the indictment, Hamidullin is a Russian citizen who once served in that nation's military as an officer and tank commander. He has been a follower of Mullah Omar, the head of the Taliban movement in Afghanistan, since 2001. By 2009, the document alleges, Hamidullin was fighting for the Taliban and the Haqqani network, an organization the United States has designated as a foreign terrorist network. He allegedly coordinated an attack on Camp Leyza, an Afghan Border Police compound in eastern Afghanistan's Khost province, in November of that year. Directing a large arsenal of weapons -- including machine guns, grenades, a portable rocket, an anti-aircraft gun and a recoilless rifle, the latter two of which were aimed to fire upon U.S. military aircraft should they arrive on site -- Hamidullin led the attack and then personally fired on U.S. and Afghan forces with a machine gun, the indictment states. The document did not state the result of the attack, but said ""a large number of insurgents were killed."" The Justice Department stated that the U.S. military took Hamidullin into custody then. The Russian citizen, now about 55 years old, was turned over to the FBI on Monday. Charges he faces include conspiring to provide and providing material support for terrorists, conspiring and attempting to destroy a U.S. aircraft, as well as conspiring and attempting to kill a U.S. government employee -- in this case, members of the U.S. military. Under federal law, a person doesn't have to have committed a crime in the United States for charges to be filed against them in U.S. courts. That's because laws for things like supporting terrorists or trying to kill U.S. citizens or employees apply outside of American soil. In fact, many people have been brought back to the United States to be tried for attacks committed overseas. Still, it's rare for such charges to come out of the ongoing hostilities in Afghanistan. ""This is very unusual,"" said Yale Law School Professor Eugene Fidell. CNN's Evan Perez contributed to this report.","A federal grand jury indicted Irek Ilgiz Hamidullin for 2009 attack on an Afghan base .

"(CNN) -- There has been a lot of talk by the right wing recently about the success of Hillary and Bill Clinton since they left the White House. Republicans are denouncing her personal wealth. They're attacking someone for achieving the American Dream. They're upset that Bill Clinton is buying American-made watches, manufactured in Detroit, to give to his friends. But here's the thing about these petty attacks: bottom line, that dog just won't hunt. Americans know it because they know the Clintons. We all know Hillary Clinton never stops looking to the future and never stops putting people first. Opinion: It's about opportunity, stupid: Why Clinton's comments matter . It doesn't take much to see these attacks for what they are. Republicans are emphasizing the financial success of the Clintons to diminish Hillary Clinton's greatest strengths -- particularly her lifelong record fighting for working people and middle-class families. Republicans want us to think, somehow, that Hillary Clinton has not been fighting for all of us for the past four decades. We know better. Hillary Clinton's entire being -- her lifetime history -- reflects her commitment to ensuring that the ability to get ahead should be determined by hard work, ambition and goals, not by circumstances. In the '70s, Hillary took her first job at the Children's Defense Fund to advocate for better education and health for children. She worked to expand health care in rural Arkansas, where it was not readily available to all. In the '80s, Hillary co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families and helped found Arkansas' first rape hotline. In the '90s, Hillary helped create the State Children's Health Insurance Program and she helped expand Head Start for low-income working families and provide after-school opportunities for older children. In the early 2000s, Hillary led the charge in the Senate for equal pay for equal work; she fought to expand health care for National Guard members and reservists; she secured funding for 9/11 first responders. As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton tirelessly engaged in diplomacy abroad in an effort to bring jobs to the United States. That's four decades' worth of work on behalf of the American people -- a record that should deflate any smoke and mirrors attack by the right wing. Yes, the Clintons have become financially successful -- and they've used their success to do even more good. Between 2000 and 2007 alone, the Clintons donated over $10 million to charity. Hillary Clinton has, on multiple occasions, raised more money for charity in one night than most people do in a lifetime. While the right wing remains focused on making sure the top 1% of income earners can keep their Bush tax cuts, Hillary Clinton continues her work today to make sure that other people get the chance to live the American Dream that she has experienced. Working hard, reaching for the stars, and then giving back are profoundly American values. The Clintons embody this in all that they do, and Republican attempts to distract from that don't even cut butter.

"(CNN) -- This year has seen Johnny Depp morph into a chameleon, Anne Hathaway perform as a parrot, Jack Black play a panda and Katy Perry turn into a Smurf. A-list celebrities are now scratching at casting directors' doors in their eagerness to voice animated creatures -- a move that would once have been considered professional suicide. ""There was a sense that actors who did animated work weren't at the top of their game career-wise,"" said Total Film editor Aubrey Day. ""There was a stigma surrounding it."" Then Robin Williams let the genie out of the bottle in 1992's ""Aladdin,"" magically transforming voice actors from faceless fill-ins to sought-after stars. ""When Robin came in -- whose career was flying at the time -- it showed people there was no stigma in animated work, and it opened the floodgates,"" said Day. ""The success of that movie made film execs think, 'We've hit on something -- if we get celebrity actors in these roles, it will generate box office.'"" A roll call of big-name actors has followed -- from Tom Hanks as Woody in ""Toy Story"" and Eddie Murphy as ""Shrek's"" wisecracking Donkey, to George Clooney as the ""Fantastic Mr Fox."" For studios, the draw is obvious: a bankable name on the poster that will entice parents -- the ones ultimately buying the tickets. ""If you can make parents think it's not going to be a painful two hours, that's a big advantage,"" said Day. ""For adults, knowing there are A-list stars in a film adds a level of curiosity and an inclination to go and see it. ""They went to see 'Bee Movie' with Jerry Seinfeld because he was in it, and 'Antz' because they wanted to hear Woody Allen in an animation."" A celebrity is also infinitely more useful than an unknown voice actor in terms of PR, since they can be sent onto chat shows and red carpets. For the A-listers themselves, animated films are now seen as credible projects -- even, since 2001, honored with their own category at the Academy Awards. And with the success of the sector in recent years, animated films have become epic productions with budgets for A-list salaries. According to boxofficemojo.com, ""Shrek 2"" and ""Toy Story 3"" both grossed over $400 million. Inevitably, there's still the sneaking suspicion that actors regard voice work as a cushy number. As Jack Black, who voices Po in ""Kung Fu Panda 2,"" out later this year, quips: ""Well obviously I don't have to do costume and make-up, and it's an easy piece of pie. Just role out of bed in your PJs and rock the mike for a few hours a month, and you've got a real cool movie."" That's galling for traditional voice actors, who regard theirs as a well-honed craft -- and who are increasingly consigned to bit parts. Artists like the late Mel Blanc, the ""Man of a Thousand Voices"" -- who brought Bugs Bunny, Tweety Bird and Daffy Duck to life -- made successful careers out of their ability to voice multiple characters, often in the same film. Their flexibility remains their trump card in the era of star casting, while celebrities ultimately need to sound enough like themselves to be recognized. ""That's the name of this game -- versatility,"" Nancy Cartwright, a veteran voice actor best known for being Bart Simpson, told CNN. ""The more versatile you are, the better chances you have of getting hired. It's not enough to just have one voice."" In ""The Simpsons,"" Cartwright not only voices Bart, but other characters including Nelson Muntz, Ralph Wiggum and Todd Flanders. Far from being a cushy job, Cartwright says voice work is a performance -- and one that requires actors to find the physicality of the character, just as they would in a live-action film. The way Cartwright holds herself changes when she is about to say a line as Bart, and she often gets so into character that she starts ad-libbing -- once snapping ""eat my shorts"" at a colleague and inadvertently creating a famous catchphrase. Black got similarly carried away as his martial-artist bear, ad-libbing so often that co-star Angelina Jolie had to be brought back in to re-record scenes that had changed. ""I go headlong and really try and get into the fur of my panda character,"" Black told CNN. ""I don't think about what it's like to live on a bamboo diet all of my life, but just the emotional reality of the scene ... I think you tend to overcompensate because you don't have the face and the eyes."" The production team helped Black and Jolie imagine what each scene would eventually look like. ""They are really great about showing us images, footage, something -- even if it's just a sculpture of your animal,"" said Black. ""They give as much as they can to give a sense (of it). But sometimes you really have to ask, because they give you five lines and you say your lines loads of times and they say, 'No, no, no, you don't understand -- while you are saying this you are dropping from the top of a 500ft building!'"" A-list stars, however, don't always guarantee success. A recent big-screen version of ""Yogi Bear"" failed to impress, despite help from Dan Aykroyd and Justin Timberlake. ""There is no direct correlation between the big name and the size of box office -- it's more: Is it a good marriage between the actor and the character they're voicing?"" said Day. ""That's the key about animation -- it's about correct casting, not stunt casting.""","From Johnny Depp to Angelina Jolie, A-list stars line up to voice animated movies .

"Washington (CNN) -- House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy tied his party's 2016 White House prospects to the election just one week away -- and how Republicans govern over the next two years. Speaking at a fundraiser in Long Island this weekend, the No. 2 House Republican told donors that Republicans need to win back the Senate this year and govern effectively in Congress beginning in January to have a chance at seating a Republican in the Oval Office. ""If we don't capture the House stronger, and the Senate, and prove we could govern, there won't be a Republican president in 2016,"" McCarthy said, according to a Politico profile published Sunday. McCarthy has privately estimated that the GOP has a 75 percent chance of retaking the Senate, according to the same report. But it will be ""tough"" if those Senate odds don't prevail, McCarthy said. ""If it stays Democratic, it's going to be a frustrating time,"" he added. One of the challenges Republicans are sure to face if they take a majority in both houses of Congress is immigration reform. McCarthy left the door open to broad immigration reform legislation, but called President Barack Obama's plans to reform the immigration system by executive order ""the worst way."" Obama has pledged to use executive orders to reform the immigration system after the midterm elections. But if that happens, McCarthy said it would ""stop everything,"" Politico reported. McCarthy ascended to his post as House Majority Leader in August after his predecessor Eric Cantor lost his Republican primary in a surprise defeat that sent shockwaves throughout the Beltway. McCarthy also knocked Obama for having a tough time ""coming to an agreement,"" but offered his praise for Vice President Joe Biden. Biden can ""do more in 36 hours than [Obama] did in three months,"" McCarthy said.","McCarthy said GOP needs to capture Congress and govern effectively for a shot at 2016 .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- A court in central India ruled Monday that seven top executives and the company they worked for are guilty for their role in the 1984 industrial disaster that killed thousands in Bhopal, India. The leaking of poisonous gas from Union Carbide India Limited -- the now-defunct local subsidiary of the American chemical company -- was one of the world's worst industrial disasters. Plaintiffs had waited more than two decades for the verdict. The convicted former employees have been sentenced to the maximum punishment allowed in the case. The judge imposed a two-year prison term and a fine of about $2,000 each after convicting the men of negligence causing death, endangering public life and causing hurt. Indian industrialist Keshub Mahindra, then head of Union Carbide India Limited, six colleagues and their company were convicted of negligence, said prosecuting attorney C. Sahay. Another company manager charged in connection with the litigation died during the trial, he said. Last year, the trial court also issued a warrant of arrest for Warren Anderson, the former chairman of the U.S.-based Union Carbide Corp. He has been declared an ""absconder"" -- or a fugitive -- from the indictment, Sahay said. Originally, the defendants faced charges of culpable homicide. In 1996, India's supreme court downgraded the charges to death by negligence following an appeal. Nearly 4,000 people died in the immediate aftermath of the escape of methyl isocyanate, a chemical used to produce pesticides, from the company's plant in Bhopal in December 1984. More than 10,000 other deaths have been blamed on related illnesses, with adverse health effects reported in hundreds of thousands of survivors. Many of them struggle with ailments including shortness of breath, cancer, near-blindness, fatigue and heart problems. Union Carbide, now a subsidiary of Dow Chemical Co., paid a $470 million settlement to India in 1989. But the International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal said survivors have received an average of only $500 each in compensation. Union Carbide says neither the parent company nor its officials are subject to the jurisdiction of Indian courts. In 1994, Union Carbide sold its stake in Union Carbide India Limited to McLeod Russell (India) Limited, which renamed the company Eveready Industries India Limited (Eveready Industries). In 1998, the state government of Madhya Pradesh took over the Bhopal site from Eveready Industries. Indian authorities blamed the tragedy on the maintenance and design of the site. The company, however, has denied the charges, insisting the leak was an act of sabotage by an employee who it said had tampered with the gas tank. Activists and survivors have long demanded that someone be held criminally responsible for the disaster, and have criticized Indian officials for their response. ""The government does not want to discourage foreign investors,"" said Abdul Jabbar, convener of the Bhopal Gas-Affected Working Women's Union, who said the Indian government has attempted to protect the multinational company. The toxic leak, he said, affected more than 575,000 people. Last year, on the 25th anniversary of the gas leak, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called the events in Bhopal in 1984 a ""tragedy of neglect."" ""The leakage resulted in over 5,000 people losing their lives and many others being incapacitated permanently. The enormity of that tragedy of neglect still gnaws at our collective conscience,"" he said. He said the government has implemented measures to provide relief and medical rehabilitation and to improve to living conditions of affected families. ""I reaffirm our government's commitment to resolving issues of safe drinking water, expeditious clean up of the site, continuation of medical research, and any other outstanding issues connected with the Bhopal gas tragedy,"" he said. Sixteen years after the leak, Union Carbide became part of the Dow Chemical Corporation. Union Carbide claims the issue has been resolved and Dow has no responsibility for the leak. ""There were no liabilities for Dow to inherit through Union Carbide on the Bhopal gas release. Dow acquired the shares of Union Carbide in 2001, more than a decade after Union Carbide settled its liabilities with the Indian government in 1989 by paying $470 million,"" Union Carbide's Bhopal website says. ""By requirement of the government of India, the Bhopal plant was detail designed, owned, operated and managed on a day-to-day basis by Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) and its employees,"" Tomm F. Sprick, director of the Union Carbide Information Center, said Monday. ""All the appropriate people from UCIL -- officers and those who actually ran the plant on a daily basis -- have appeared to face charges. ""Union Carbide and its officials were not part of this case since the charges were divided long ago into a separate case. Furthermore, Union Carbide and its officials are not subject to the jurisdiction of the Indian court since they did not have any involvement in the operation of the plant, which was owned and operated by UCIL.""","NEW: Union Carbide and its officials ""not subject to the jurisdiction of the Indian court""

"(CNN) -- A sheriff's deputy who shot and killed a 13-year-old California boy last year when he mistook a toy gun for a real rifle did not break the law, a prosecutor said Monday. The investigation concluded that since Deputy Erick Gelhaus ""honestly and reasonably believed"" his life was in danger, the shooting of Andy Lopez was ""lawful self-defense,"" said Sonoma County, California, District Attorney Jill Ravitch. The Sonoma County deputy said he thought Lopez was armed with an AK-47, but it was actually a replica. Gelhaus said that when he yelled at the boy, whose back was turned to him, to put the weapon down, the boy turned toward him, according to a sheriff's statement issued after the October 22, 2013, shooting in Santa Rosa, California. As Lopez turned ""toward him, the barrel of the assault rifle was rising up and turning in his direction,"" the statement said. ""The deputy feared for his safety, the safety of his partner, and the safety of the community members in the area."" Ravitch displayed a photo of the plastic replica next to a real AK-47 assault rifle to demonstrate to reporters why she decided not to prosecute the deputy. Justice Coalition for Andy Lopez, which was formed in the wake of the shooting, called for supporters to gather in Santa Rosa on Monday afternoon to protest the decision. ""It's ridiculous that these cops can be on our streets and think it's OK to use the excuse that they feared for their life when they kill our children, when they kill our youth, when they kill anybody,"" Lopez supporter Nicole Guerra said after the announcement. ""These kids now have to walk around in fear because they know that these cops can get away with murder."" An autopsy report said the boy died of seven bullet wounds to the chest and right hip. Family friend Gabriel Roque said in an interview with CNN affiliate KGO last October that Lopez ""was a 13-year-old boy who was no harm to anybody."" ""This was not a grown man walking down the street with a gun,"" she told the affiliate. ""He was a 13-year-old little boy. You could just tell him to put it down.""","Deputy Gelhaus ""honestly and reasonably believed"" his life was in danger, prosecutor says .

"San Diego (CNN) -- It can't be. The Republican Party's wise new sage on immigration is ... Mitt Romney? In a recent interview with Univision, the Spanish-language television network, the former presidential candidate -- whom some suspect may be gearing up to run again in 2016 -- criticized President Obama's use of executive action to temporarily re-prioritize deportations. Nothing new here, folks. Most Republicans posed the same criticism, even at the cost of looking like hypocrites for contradicting their George W. Bush-era views in favor of expanding executive power. One minute, Republicans are threatening not to work with Obama on any issue; the next, they're whining that Obama didn't wait around to work with them on immigration. And I thought elephants were supposed to have good memories. But there is more. In the Univision interview, Romney also said that permanent immigration reform was ""badly needed"" and urged Republicans in Congress to pass legislation that will make ""more transparent"" the process by which illegal immigrants can obtain residency. ""Maybe even then,"" Romney said, ""Republicans will swallow hard and say, 'OK, even despite the fact that we now have a stick in our eye launched by the President, we're going to go ahead and try and see if we can't make some improvements to the immigration system.' I hope we're able to do that."" Conservative radio hosts, who constantly demonstrate how poorly they understand the immigration issue, went ballistic. They tore into Romney, accusing him of capitulating to the left's demands for ""amnesty."" Meanwhile, some of their callers, who often seem to understand the issue even less, insisted that Romney supported ""an open border."" More than one right-wing commentator declared Romney's possible presidential bid over before it began. Of course, what Romney said is completely reasonable. The immigration system is broken, and Republicans should try to fix it. That's what leaders and lawmakers are supposed to do. Moreover, now that Obama has put Republicans in ""check"" with his executive action, the only move they have left for ""checkmate"" is to pass an immigration bill that is more substantial than his executive action. Republicans don't have to give away the store and provide millions of people here illegally with citizenship, complete with voting privileges. They can approve work permits, and couple it with border security and those guest workers for which their friends in the business community have such an insatiable hunger. And, in the ramp up to 2016, it wouldn't hurt the GOP to appear less hostile to Hispanics, both immigrants and the native-born. Republicans should think of passing immigration reform as an investment for the future. Still, there must be a mistake. You're telling me that Romney is sounding like a grown-up when talking about immigration? Who knew that was possible? In 2012, whether it was on the campaign trail or in debates with fellow Republicans, Romney often demagogued the issue to scare up votes from those who tremble at the thought that America is becoming more Latino. The former governor of Massachusetts said one wrong thing after another. Remember when he made that tacky joke with donors, suggesting that he might ""have a better shot at winning"" the presidency if he were Latino. Romney also promised that, if he were elected president and if Congress passed the DREAM Act — a popular piece of legislation with Latinos, which would have allowed undocumented students to stay in the country if they went to college or joined the military — that he would veto the bill. He attacked Texas Gov. Rick Perry for signing a law that allows illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition at public colleges and universities. And then he blasted former House Speaker Newt Gingrich for proposing work permits for the undocumented and declaring that the GOP shouldn't split up families. Romney came off as cynical when his campaign put up a television ad that tried to discredit Perry by portraying him as chummy with former Mexican President Vicente Fox. And then he came across as hypocritical when it came out that, for all his fire-breathing against illegal immigrants, he had hired — to work on his house in Massachusetts — a landscaping company that employed them. While other candidates were going out and trying to get Hispanics to pick them, Romney seemed to go out of his way to pick on Hispanics. It's no wonder that Romney — who, ironically, had a father who was born in Mexico and a record of supporting immigration reform as Massachusetts governor — became persona non grata with Hispanics. On election day, the Republican pulled down only 27 percent of the Hispanic vote. Obama got 71 percent. Even after the election, Romney's Hispanic ""offensive"" still wasn't over. He had the gall in a post-election phone call with supporters to insist that the reason he did so poorly was because Obama gave Hispanics a bunch of freebies including Obamacare and ""amnesty for the children of illegals."" When a candidate gets into a hole this deep with any group of voters, it's almost impossible to get out. But, whether he runs for president again or not, Romney seems determined to try. And the first thing he's doing is taking on immigration with an eye toward solutions as opposed to soundbites. When it comes to this contentious issue, I have no idea what brought Romney to his senses. But whatever it is, let's hope that other Republicans are exposed to it — and that it's highly contagious.","Ruben Navarrette: In the 2012 election, Mitt Romney was a backward voice on immigration .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama has turned off large parts of America through radicalism, incompetence and political ineptness. As my friend Barry Casselman argues, ""Obama has the worst political tin ear I've seen at that level. (I realize he thinks he is bringing out his base vote). But he's almost daring most Americans to turn against him."" My prediction for midterm election night this coming Tuesday is that many Americans are going to take the President up on his dare. Of course, nothing is over until it's over. Hard campaigning and a few changes in the news can shift races, and there are a lot of races within the margin of error in polling. However, as my colleague Joe Gaylord, with whom I worked on campaigns for 30 years, points out: ""In tidal years everything collapses against the losers the last weekend."" He remembers races in 1982 where our incumbent was up by 10 points on Friday and lost on Tuesday. My take is that this is going to be a tide if not a tidal wave. Why? Because in most races, Democrats will stay home, Republicans will vote and independents will break heavily against the Democrats. Recent polls indicate the younger voters (millennials) are likely to break Republican after two massive victories for Obama in that age group. Latinos seem much more favorable to Republicans than many expected and much less likely to turn out for Democrats. Meanwhile, the margin for Democrats among women has shrunk dramatically, and in some races Republicans are now carrying both men and women (and that really would create a tidal wave). And while the African-American community remains the most loyal to President Obama, even there a fight has been developing. Some new ads appealing to African-Americans to leave the Democratic Party are stirring up a lot of attention, so it will be fascinating election night to watch for African-American turnout and for a small but real increase in the Republican vote among African-Americans (note, for example, Gov. John Kasich's endorsement by a leading African-American newspaper in Ohio). Overall, I think Republicans will gain six to 10 Senate seats, with 10 being more likely than six. Actually, winning more than 10 (think New Mexico, Virginia, Minnesota in that order) may be more likely than winning five or less. If Scott Brown, who has run a brilliant race, beats Sen. Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire (and she has run a terrible race) it will signal a big night for Republicans. A key question is whether Republicans win Georgia outright, or have to win a special election on January 6, three days after the new Congress assembles. That turnout is made more complicated if the governor's race also goes into a runoff, which would be December 10, and it will be very hard for Democrats to win a turnout fight immediately after New Year's. Louisiana will almost certainly go to a runoff, and the Republican will almost certainly win on December 6. In the House, Republicans will likely gain seven to 14 seats. Since they start at 234 seats, a 12-seat gain would match the 1946 post World War II high point. If they grab 14 seats, they would have more seats than at any time since 1928. Governorships are a mixed bag, and so intensely local that I really don't have a good read on what is likely to happen. Republicans start the evening ahead 29 to 21, and they could add Massachusetts, Connecticut, Colorado, Arkansas and Illinois. However, there are four or five states where the Republican incumbent is embattled and in a very close race. If Republicans break even or add one or two governors, I think we could describe it as a very good night for the party. At the state legislative level, which has huge implications for the growth of young, future lawmakers, the ability to experiment with new solutions at the state level, and control of congressional reapportionment, look for the Republicans to gain 300 state legislative seats and control of six more legislative bodies, giving them the all-time high mark in Republican history. But more than the raw numbers, it will be interesting to keep an eye on some specific trends. New England, for example, might see a big resurgence of the GOP. If Republicans win governorships in Massachusetts and Connecticut and the Senate race in New Hampshire, something big will clearly be happening. Another trend could be the election of new solution-oriented, bright and articulate Republican senators. Ben Sasse in Nebraska has been ignored because he is so clearly going to win, but he will be one of the most intellectually prepared conservatives since Bob Taft. Cory Gardner will be a superstar if he wins Colorado, while Iowa's Joni Ernst has already become a national figure. Former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, now running in New Hampshire, will have earned star status by winning in two states. All that said, Florida may be the hardest fought campaign in the country. Gov. Rick Scott has been a very successful manager of the state, but is not a natural politician. Former Gov. Charlie Crist is a great politician, but his swings from Goldwater Republican to Obama Democrat have made it impossible to predict what kind of governor he would be now. This race has so much money going into it, and is so intense, that it is extremely difficult to predict what will happen on Tuesday. A Scott win would be a signal that Democrats simply are refusing to turn out. A Crist win would be a signal that the Democratic machine has been able to mobilize apathetic and disappointed voters. One last thing to keep an eye on next week: exit polling on women, Latinos, Asian-Americans, African-Americans and millennials. If Democrats are losing ground in most or all of those groups, the coronation of Hillary Clinton may have to be postponed for a while. And if all the harsh Democratic advertising fails, it may be a sign, as Molly Ball suggests in The Atlantic, that ""cranky social issues warriors"" whose campaigns are ""obsessed with social issues"" may now be defining Democrats and not Republicans. Looking beyond the election, there are two big questions, namely, how will President Obama react to the results, and what will Republicans do? Certainly, the President and his team will face a clear choice: Do they follow Woodrow Wilson's response to the 1918 election and hide in a bunker, using executive orders and defying the new Congress? Or do they follow President Eisenhower's example after the 1958 election and find a way to work with the opposition party's congressional leadership? We may not know the answer to this until the State of the Union and the budget proposals early next year. But Republican leaders have a unique opportunity to fill a vacuum of ideas and hope, and already people like Speaker John Boehner, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Sen. Marco Rubio have been outlining positive agendas. But Barry Casselman perhaps caught as well as anyone the challenge facing Republicans, when he wrote: . ""Let us not forget that the energy of this wave has been provided by the incompetence of Barack Obama and his overreaching allies across the nation. The Republicans, if they win, will now need to put forward new ideas. Otherwise, victory next Tuesday will be an empty one."" Republicans need new ideas. But they also need to be able to put those ideas into action. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.","Obama administration marked by radicalism, incompetence: Newt Gingrich .

"(CNN) -- It has been one month since University of Virginia student Hannah Graham was last seen, and her parents are asking for help. ""It is heartbreaking for us that the person or persons who know where Hannah is have not come forward with that information. It is within their power both to end this nightmare for all,"" Graham's parents, John and Sue Graham, said Monday. Her friends have not given up hope either. In a statement released to CNN they ask ""that everyone in Charlottesville and surrounding areas be on the lookout for new clues. No clue is too small and every search of personal property, even if it does not yield a result, is helpful."" For the better part of the last month, Mark Eggeman from the Virginia Department of Emergency Management has helped orchestrate the largest missing person search in Virginia's history. ""The search for Hannah is currently in a transition stage,"" Eggeman said Friday. The city of Charlottesville is in charge as of Monday, taking over from the Department of Emergency Management, with a different focus and change in strategy. Eggeman said experts are still investigating tips and leads and are analyzing some imaging taken from a specialized camera mounted on board a private plane. The plane was donated to the search effort from Woolpert Inc. The design and geospatial company based out of Ohio donated its plane with an ultra-high precision sensor to scan ""areas of interest"" that were requested by law enforcement. The scanning is ""positionally accurate,"" Senior Vice President Shane Imwalle said, which can be a great help to law enforcement. While the search for Graham is paramount for the Charlottesville Police Department, solving the abduction and killing of Morgan Harrington, a Virginia Tech student who went missing in October 2009, is a priority for the Virginia State Police. A law enforcement source tells CNN that foreign DNA in the Harrington case provides a forensic link to Jesse Matthew, who has been charged with abduction with the intent to defile in Graham's disappearance. Local Yellow Cab owner Mark Brown said his cabbies who knew Matthew say he was driving a cab the night Harrington went missing. Matthew held a taxi cab license in the city of Charlottesville from 2005 to 2010. A source close to the case confirmed that police recently impounded the cab Matthew was allegedly driving the night Harrington disappeared. The Virginia State Police said they ""will release new information at a time and in a manner that does not jeopardize the integrity of this ongoing, complex criminal investigation."" Is Cassandra Morton's death linked to latest case? As the investigation into both cases continues, so does the search for Graham. In the early morning hours of September 13, several surveillance cameras in the Charlottesville downtown mall area showed Graham leaving the Tempo Bar at around 2 a.m. The cameras also showed a man, later identified as Matthew, following her. Matthew is believed to be the last person who saw Graham alive. A warrant for his arrest was issued and authorities later found Matthew 1,300 miles away camping on a beach in Galveston, Texas. The 32-year-old Matthew was returned to Virginia and charged. His next court hearing is scheduled for December 4. Matthew's attorney did not respond to CNN's request for comment. Graham's friends continue to say how appreciative they are to everyone who has volunteered. ""We also want others to take the time to stop and hug someone they love. Words cannot express our gratitude to the Charlottesville Police Department and the overwhelming support and love from our community...please continue to keep Hannah, her parents, and her brother in your thoughts and prayers,"" their statement said. Authorities are offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to the safe return of Graham, 18, who was a second-year student at the university. ""Again, we would like to urge anyone who has not already searched their property in the city of Charlottesville, or any of the neighboring counties, to please do so today.

"Washington (CNN) -- While Jeb Bush is still publicly noncommittal about a possible presidential bid, his family is far less circumspect. And if recent comments by George P. Bush are any indication, Jeb Bush's eldest son got the go-ahead from the family. The bigger question, of course, is whether Jeb Bush got the go-ahead -- from himself. While George P. told ABC that ""I think it's more than likely that he's giving this a serious thought in moving forward,"" it's still unclear whether his father is actually willing to dive into a presidential bid. One source with knowledge of Jeb Bush's thinking tells CNN ""wanting to do this and doing it are two different things."" In fact this source adds, ""He hasn't made a decision yet despite reports to the contrary. He is seriously considering and is going through a thoughtful process. He appreciates the warm wishes and support, but he is a methodical guy and won't change his timeline."" That timeline anticipates Jeb Bush making a decision by the end of the year. While some donors may be waiting to see what Bush does before they commit to a candidate, the source says Bush himself has not asked for them to stay on the sidelines. ""They are calling him, but all he is saying is he hasn't made a decision. There is no organized outreach sanctioned by him."" Several donors told CNN that that in private sessions, Bush has not given any more indication than he has publicly about his intentions. One of the donors said ""he is behaving as if he is looking at it seriously,"" but his reluctance to talk about it is ""wearing thin."" The choice about whether to run, a source close to Bush explains is ""a serious decision which he understands better than most."" OPINION: Six Senate races to watch . With a brother and a father who have served in the highest office, that's a fact. But it's clear both of them -- Bush 41 and Bush 43 -- would like to him to run. ""If you asked Dad the same question -- 'Should Jeb run?' -- he'd say yes,"" Neil Bush said in an interview with CNN earlier this year. ""Yeah, he would say yeah."" Former President George W. Bush told Fox News earlier this month he had encouraged his brother to run. ""He and I did have a conversation. I of course was pushing him to run for president. He of course was saying, 'I haven't made up my mind,'"" Bush said. ""He's seen his dad, he's seen his brother. And so he's a very thoughtful man and he's -- he's weighing his options."" One person who has not been enthusiastic about a possible Jeb Bush run has been his mother, Barbara Bush, who had told interviewers there were ""enough Bushes"" who had been President. However, Jeb told the AP that she was now ""neutral, trending in a different direction."" The notion of Jeb Bush running is something that has resurfaced after years of dormancy. ""If you had asked me a few years back, I would've said it was less likely,"" George P. Bush, who is running for Texas Land Commissioner, told ABC. ""The family will be behind him 100% if he decides to do it."" WATCH: Are fear politics dominating the midterms? One calculation that seems to have changed recently is Bush's closest family support. He told the Associated Press earlier this month that his wife, Columba, is ""supportive"" of a possible run for the presidency. Before his statement, many in political circles assumed she would be reluctant -- even a stumbling block- to engage in a presidential campaign. Bush has been active on the campaign trail during the midterm elections, stumping for GOP candidates across the country -- and helping them raise money. He's clearly collected chits -- but then again, so have all of the potential Republican 2016 contenders.","Jeb Bush's son told ABC that ""it's more than likely"" that Bush is giving 2016 run ""serious thought""

"Urfa, Turkey (CNN) -- The petite 25-year-old tentatively opens the door to the hotel room where we've agreed to meet. Her face is covered, but her body language betrays her anxiety. She slowly lifts her niqab, revealing her young, heart-shaped face. Her large brown eyes, filled with guilt and turmoil, are delicately made up under perfectly sculpted brows. She calls herself 'Khadija.' It's not her real name, because she's a marked woman. Once a member of a fearsome, female ISIS brigade, she's a recent defector, disillusioned by the group's brutality. Her interview with CNN is the first time she has ever told anyone her story. 'I ran away to something uglier' Growing up in Syria, Khadija's family ensured she got an education. She earned her college degree and began teaching elementary school. Khadija describes her family and upbringing as ""not overly conservative."" When the Syrian uprising began more than three and a half years ago, Khadija joined the masses who began peaceful protests against the government of President Bashar al-Assad. ""We'd go out and demonstrate. The security services would chase us. We'd write on walls, have different outfits to change into,"" she said. ""Those days were great."" But it was when the Syrian uprising spiraled into chaos and violence that she said she began to lose her soul, her humanity. ""Everything around us was chaos,"" she said, her words tumbling out. ""Free Syrian Army, the regime, barrel bombs, strikes, the wounded, clinics, blood -- you want to tear yourself away, to find something to run to. ""My problem was I ran away to something uglier."" Gradual induction . She found herself drawn to the eloquence of a Tunisian whom she met online. Taken with his manners, she grew to trust him over time and he gradually lured her into the Islamic State, she said. He assured her that the group was not what people thought, that it was not a terrorist organization. ""He would say, 'We are going to properly implement Islam. Right now we are in a state of war, a phase where we need to control the country, so we have to be harsh.'"" He told her he was coming to the Syrian city of Raqqa, that they could even get married. ""I got in touch with my cousin, and she said, 'You can come join us in the Khansa'a Brigade. She was living in Raqqa with her husband who was with the Islamic State,"" Khadija said. The brigade is the feared, all-female police for ISIS. Khadija convinced her family to move to Raqqa, saying it would be easier to register her younger siblings in school, and that they would have the support of relatives. With her cousin to open the doors, Khadija was welcomed into the feared Khansa'a brigade. Inside the female ISIS brigade . The Khansa'a Brigade is made up of around 25 to 30 women and is tasked with patrolling the streets of Raqqa to ensure that women adhere to proper clothing as outlined by the Islamic State. Beaded or slightly form-fitting abayas are banned. Women are not allowed to show their eyes. Those who broke the laws are lashed. The lashings to the women who broke ISIS rules were carried out by Umm Hamza. When Khadija first saw Umm Hamza, she was terrified. ""She's not a normal female. She's huge, she has an AK, a pistol, a whip, a dagger and she wears the niqab,"" Khadija said. Brigade commander Umm Rayan sensed Khadija's fear ""and she got close to me and said a sentence I won't forget. She said, 'We are harsh with the infidels, but merciful among ourselves.'"" Khadija was trained to clean, dismantle, and fire a weapon. She was paid $200 a month and received food rations. Her family sensed Khadija was slipping away, but were helpless to stop it. Her mother tried to warn her. ""She would always say to me, 'Wake up, take care of yourself. You are walking, but you don't know where you are going.'"" UAE's first female fighter pilot led airstrike against ISIS . Second thoughts . Initally, Khadija did not pay attention to her mother's warnings, seduced by the sense of power. But eventually, she started questioning herself and the principles of the Islamic State. ""At the start, I was happy with my job. I felt that I had authority in the streets. But then I started to get scared, scared of my situation. I even started to be afraid of myself."" She started thinking: ""I am not like this. I have a degree in education. I shouldn't be like this. What happened to me? What happened in my mind that brought me here?"" And her image of ISIS began to crumble. Burned into her mind is an image she saw online of a 16-year-old boy who was crucified for rape. She questioned her inclusion in a group capable of such violence. ""The worst thing I saw was a man getting his head hacked off in front of me,"" she said. Violence against women . Even more personally, she witnessed ISIS' brand of violence reserved for women. The brigade shared its building with a man who specialized in marriage for ISIS fighters. ""He was one of the worst people,"" she said of the man tasked with finding wives for both local and foreign fighters. ""The foreign fighters are very brutal with women, even the ones they marry,"" she said. ""There were cases where the wife had to be taken to the emergency ward because of the violence, the sexual violence."" Khadija saw a future she did not want. With her commander pressuring her to submit to marriage, Khadija decided she needed to leave the brigade. ""So it was at this point, I said enough. After all that I had already seen and all the times I stayed silent, telling myself, 'We're at war, then it will all be rectified.' ""But after this, I decided no, I have to leave."" Khadija left just days before the coalition airstrikes, but her family remains in Syria. She was smuggled across the border to Turkey. Inside the online world of the women of ISIS . Life after ISIS . Khadija still wears the niqab, not just to conceal her identity but also because she's struggling to adapt back to life outside the Islamic State. Regretful of her immersion in radical Islam, she is wary of another sudden change. ""It has to be gradual, so that I don't become someone else. I am afraid of becoming someone else. Someone who swings, as a reaction in the other direction, after I was so entrenched in religion, that I reject religion completely,"" she said. Towards the end of our interview, speaking about how ISIS could have gotten a foothold in parts of Syrian society, she has a personal moment. ""How did we allow them to come in? How did we allow them to rule us? There is a weakness in us."" Khadija spoke to us because she said she wants people, especially women, to know the truth about ISIS. ""I don't want anyone else to be duped by them. Too many girls think they are the right Islam,"" she said. She desperately wants to be the girl she was before falling under the spell of ISIS -- ""a girl who is merry, who loves life and laughter... who loves to travel, to draw, to walk in the street with her headphones listening to music without caring what anyone thinks,"" she said. ""I want to be like that again.""","25-year-old joined ISIS after chaos following protests against Syrian president .

"(CNN) -- Recently, University of Illinois Chancellor Phyllis Wise, who is Asian-American, was bombarded with harassing tweets when she decided not to cancel classes at the Urbana-Champaign campus during January's severe weather. Upset over the decision, some students attacked her with racial and gender slurs. The harsh hashtag-- #f---phyllis -- reinforced notions that the sexual domination and objectification of women are still major problems in our society and on our campuses. Would the students have engaged in attacks on gender and race had the chancellor been a white man? Somehow, I don't think so. There was no respect for Wise's position, nor her credentials -- but her high-visibility job made her stand out. The duality of being hypervisible and simultaneously invisible is the latest identity quagmire that some highly accomplished women must navigate. They are hypervisible because they are often the only one of a few in their position -- thus, they stand out. Yet because of their gender, and sometimes their race, their presence is not the norm, and others are not used to seeing them in these roles. Those same women who worked hard to climb the ladder to success sometimes find that they are out of place and unwelcome, rendering them invisible in certain situations. It's almost as if they're saying, ""I see you, but I don't respect you and therefore I'm not going to acknowledge you as a human being."" While women have moved into positions of power, they have not moved with ease. It's perplexing, given women's accomplishments over the decades, that it continues to happen 50 years after the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which banned employment discrimination. But it is also not new. Pioneering journalist Ida B. Wells was threatened with murder after speaking out publicly in the 1890s. She became hypervisible after she criticized the lynching of black men. When whites ransacked her newspaper office with the intent to kill her, she only escaped the attempt on her life because she was out of town. Today, powerful, public women are not usually threatened with murder. But their opinions are often discounted, disregarded and dismissed -- or they are personally attacked. #CNNWomen Tweetchat: Join the conversation on Friday March 7 at 5pm ET/10pm GMT . In my research on the experiences of black women television news managers, I discovered this same dichotomy. On the one hand, these executives are highly recruited for their production and management skills. On the other hand, a little more than one-third of the 40 women interviewed described feeling invisible in editorial meetings where their ideas were not always given full credit until they came from someone else, usually a white man. This rendering of women's ideas and personhood as invisible has consequences. Psychologist Derald Wing Sue calls these subtle and not-so-subtle snubs ""microaggressions"" and says they can lead to higher stress levels and more illness. As highly accomplished women move into spaces previously reserved for men, they might face more of these microagressions, which are often magnified in a social media, Internet age. As college classrooms become increasingly female with more students of color, how can we teach that hard work and persistence will get them noticed, when the truth is, it might simultaneously render them invisible? How do we stop the disrespect? First, we must acknowledge it and say it's wrong. Silence is not an option. This is what Phyllis Wise did when she wrote an essay addressing the hateful tweets. ""What was most disturbing was witnessing social media drive a discussion quickly into the abyss of hateful comments and even threats of violence,"" Wise wrote in Inside Higher Ed. Secondly, we must continuously teach that the disrespect of women online or in person will not be tolerated. The University of Illinois example reminds us that if cyberharassment can happen to a woman as highly accomplished as Wise, all women are vulnerable. There is an urgent need to educate. Lastly, we must continue to see ourselves as leaders, regardless of whether others are used to seeing us in that role. Only when women in positions of power become the norm will they be able to fully exercise that power. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ava Thompson Greenwell.","A recent attack on a university leader shows how public women are personally attacked .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge ruled Tuesday that an Oklahoma law limiting marriage to heterosexual couples violates the U.S. Constitution, giving yet another victory to same-sex marriage supporters. U.S. District Court Judge Terence Kern said the court would not immediately enforce this ruling -- therefore not opening the doors right away to marriages of gay and lesbian couples in Oklahoma -- pending appeals. Still, he delivered a clear opinion on how the voter-approved Oklahoma state constitutional amendment relates to the U.S. Constitution. ""The Court holds that Oklahoma's constitutional amendment limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution,"" the judge wrote, saying that protection ""is at the very heart of our legal system."" His decision specifically deals with ""Part A"" of an Oklahoma Constitutional amendment that says, in part, ""marriage in this state shall consist only of the union of one man and one woman."" Kern said that ""the Court's rationality review reveals Part A an arbitrary, irrational exclusion of just one class of Oklahoma citizens from a government benefit."" Proponents of the state constitutional measure, he points out, ""purposefully (drew a line) between two groups of Oklahoma citizens -- same-sex couples desiring an Oklahoma marriage license and opposite-sex couples desiring (a) marriage license."" CNN -- which has a copy of the ruling -- first learned of the court's decision via Twitter. This case was first brought by a pair of lesbian couples in 2004, the same year that Oklahoma citizens voted to put a ban on same-sex marriage in their state's constitution. Susan Barton, one of the four women involved, told CNN that she is ""absolutely thrilled"" with the decision, saying it was worth the long fight. She and her partner, Gay Phillips, have lived in Oklahoma for more than 50 years. They have been together for the past three decades and got a civil union in Vermont and have marriage licenses issued from Vancouver, British Columbia, and San Francisco. ""You can't stay in this for nine years and not have faith,"" Barton said. ""... I feel like we are already married, (but) I want our state to recognize our marriage."" CNN received no immediate response from the Tulsa County district attorney's office, which was among those arguing for the state's same-sex marriage ban. Gov. Mary Fallin spoke out against the ruling, which she said defied the views of 75% of those who voted in favor of limiting marriage to a man and woman. ""I support the right of Oklahoma's voters to govern themselves on this and other policy matters,"" Fallin said. ""I am disappointed in the judge's ruling and troubled that the will of the people has once again been ignored by the federal government."" Learn more about same-sex marriage . Several courts ruled on it over what now has nearly been a decade, but the momentous decisions were indirectly related. Those were made last summer by the U.S. Supreme Court, which stated that the federal Defense of Marriage Act ""violates basic due process and equal protection principles applicable to the Federal Government."" That meant the U.S. government would -- for tax and other legal purposes -- recognize same-sex marriages. However, the rulings did not directly address the many states, like Oklahoma, which have prohibited such marriages within their borders. Yet it has opened the door for lower federal courts weighing in on the matter, like U.S. District Judge Robert Shelby's December 20 decision striking down Utah's ban on same-sex marriage. He argued that state's law conflicted with the equal protection and due process guarantees under the U.S. Constitution. Carl Tobias, a constitutional law professor at the University of Richmond, said that federal district judges striking at state bans ""looks like a trend"" that, ironically, is kicking into gear in the generally conservative states of Utah and Oklahoma. ""It seems to be moving much more quickly than people thought,"" said Tobias. In his ruling Tuesday, Kern brought up both the high court's decision (United States v. Windsor) and Shelby's ruling, which he noted was about a case ""nearly identical"" to the one in Oklahoma. At least 1,000 marriage licenses were issued for gay and lesbian couples in Utah between the time Shelby made his ruling and the U.S. Supreme Court issued its stay Monday, pending appeals. The federal government said it will recognize those marriages, while the state of Utah said it would not. Kern's decision -- citing what happened in Utah -- to issue an immediate stay of his own decision means no gay or lesbian couples in Oklahoma will be in limbo as the case likely moves forward in the federal courts. His ruling Tuesday is not a total victory for the Oklahoma couples. The judge didn't rule in support of their argument challenging Section 2 of the Defense of Marriage Act asserting that states shall not ""be required"" to accept same-sex marriages performed in other states. Nor does it provide any ""other relief,"" such as possible monetary damages, as they'd sought. Still, Kern does say, ""The Barton couple and their counsel are commended for their foresight, courage, and perseverance."" And he is clear in delivering the plaintiffs their biggest victory, regarding their chief focus in the Oklahoma state constitution. ""Part A,"" Kern writes, ""intentionally discriminates against same-sex couples desiring an Oklahoma marriage license without a legally sufficient justification."" So what happens next? Tobias noted that Utah and Oklahoma appeals could be heard together, because they're similar and both in the Tenth Circuit. Unlike the solitary district judges, such appeals are done by a panel of three judges whose mission is to decide whether or not the lower court erred in its decision. Eventually, the Supreme Court -- even though it has notably steered clear of ruling on state-by-state variations -- could weigh in, settling the matter of whether states can ban same-sex marriage once and for all. That is a prospect few might have anticipated prior to last summer's Windsor ruling, though there's no telling how the divided court might come down. In the Windsor case, the Supreme Court struck down a key part of the Defense of Marriage Act, which denied legally married same-sex couples the same federal benefits provided to heterosexual spouses. ""Windsor really might have been the tipping point,"" Tobias said. ""But we'll see.""

Hudhud is expected to intensify and peak to around 115 miles per hour (185 kilometers per hour) by Sunday afternoon, Singh said. But Singh downplayed the intensity of the storms, asking people ""not to get unduly alarmist.""

"(CNN) -- Uniformed Egyptian police pull a woman in nothing but her underclothes from a frenzied mob. ""Get back boy! Get back!"" the officers say as one lifts his pistol into the air. Large patches of skin on the victim appear bloodied and raw as she struggles to walk toward a police van with hordes of men still fighting for a handful of her body. Moments later, she falls to the ground, naked. Police carry her into the vehicle, seemingly incapable of thwarting the crowd. In the background, revelers set off fireworks and wave flags to celebrate the election of Egypt's new president. This is just one of at least five mob sexual assaults that took place in Cairo's Tahrir Square in the past week, according to the ""I Saw Harassment"" campaign, which documents sexual violence against women in Egypt. The attack is shown in a less than two-minute viral cell phone video that CNN cannot independently verify. It is unclear when the video was shot, but social media reports indicate the incident took place Tuesday after Egypt's election body announced Abdel Fattah el-Sisi won elections in a landslide. Days later, as the restive country celebrated the presidential inauguration, human rights groups documented more sexual assaults in Tahrir. ""It is shameful that the security leaders of the Ministry of Interior did not take into account any security measures or plans to prevent such incidents,"" a statement from the ""I Saw Harassment"" campaign reads. ""Junior officers and individuals were left alone to face sexual harassment groups without any tools or plans."" Four of the five victims sexually assaulted in the square required medical attention, the ""I Saw Harassment"" campaign said. The attacks against them were so ferocious that several officers deployed to rescue the women were themselves wounded by the crowd, according to a statement from the Interior Ministry on Monday. Police arrested seven men Monday on charges of sexual harassment after two women filed police reports and identified their attackers, an Interior Ministry spokesman said. Video of one of the assaults was posted on YouTube and the video is a part of the ongoing investigation, said another official from the Interior Ministry, who was not authorized to speak to the media. The response by authorities did little to squelch anger on social media channels, where many criticized the authorities and criticized local media for a lack of professionalism. ""They are happy, huh?"" Maha Bahnassy said laughingly about the crowd on private network Tahrir TV during a live report on harassment from inside the square. Bahnassy publicly apologized Monday, saying her comments were misunderstood. Activists said the anchorwoman's jarring remarks appeared part of a general trend by Egypt's pro-military factions to sideline the systemic violence against women in favor of glorifying Egypt's new head of state, former army chief Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. The state-affiliated National Council of Women characterized Sunday night's violence as an orchestrated conspiracy against el-Sisi, saying, ""The acts were meant to spoil the joy of Egyptians and their wedding of democracy."" The group called on officials to find the ""masterminds."" ""Every day sexual harassment is a social epidemic affecting everyone, every day. Mob violence is an extreme form of this act that has been normalized by society,"" said Noora Flinkman, communication manager at HarassMap, a volunteer-based initiative aimed at combating sexual harassment. The group dismissed claims that the attacks were part of an organized political act against the new government. A 2013 United Nations report from the Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women found that 99.3% of Egyptian women have experienced some form of sexual harassment and more than 82% of female respondents felt unsafe in the street. The mass attacks come just days after Egypt passed the first law criminalizing sexual harassment, making it punishable by up to five years in prison and a maximum fine of 50,000 Egyptian pounds. ""For a long time harassers have been able to harass with impunity. Now with this amendment to the law it is a good opportunity to take action not just in cases of mob assault but in cases of everyday sexual harassment,"" Flinkman said. ""We are waiting to see what steps the authorities will take.""","Women sexually assaulted at Egypt's inauguration festivities, anti-violence group says .

"(CNN) -- Poaching tourists from the trendy tango bars of Buenos Aires or the glamorous beaches of Rio de Janeiro would be a tall task for most cities. But the Chilean capital, Santiago, is looking to do just that by encouraging travelers passing through on business to stay and uncover its potential as a hip South American destination. Chile has become one of the continent's leading locations in which to do business in recent years. Foreign investment increased by 80 percent in 2011 alone, totaling $12 billion for the year according to Daniel Pardo, director of SERNATUR, the Chilean tourism ministry. As a result, the number of foreigners coming into the country for trade purposes has increased along a similarly sharp upward curve. This surge has been concentrated mainly in Santiago, Chile's nerve center and economic engine room, and it's here that Pardo and the country's tourist board spy an as yet untapped opportunity. ""Hopefully by bringing out those business people that are coming here for a week to do their jobs (they will) stay for the weekend and enjoy the country,"" Pardo told CNN's Richard Quest. ""There's a lot of interest in coming to Chile,"" he adds. ""And we've seen it in our numbers, with a 60 percent growth in tourism this year."" See also: Exploring the mystery and beauty of Chile . Travelers who take up the invitation to hang around will find a variety of parks, churches and museums which offer a wealth of easily accessible tourist sites -- ideal for the culture vulture with a couple of hours to spare. For those with a little more time on their hands meanwhile there is even more to explore and experience around the city's outskirts and beyond. With the Santiago business traveler in mind, CNN asked Lonely Planet's Bridget Gleeson, co- author of Lonely Planet Chile and Easter Island Travel Guide, to lend her expertise in selecting the city's best spots. In the city . Santiago offers an intriguing mix of both the modern and the classic. Historic sites such as the Catedral Metropolitana contrast sharply against the rowdy Mercado Central fish market, which offers ""a colorful attraction for photographers and foodies alike,"" says Gleeson. Touring the city's downtown district on foot is a particularly nice way to explore Santiago, she adds, while the nearby Centro Cultural Palacio La Moneda museum plays host to the finest Chilean modern art. Other Santiago highlights include Museo de la Moda (Museum of Fashion) in the Vitacura district -- which includes famed items such as John Lennon's jacket and the famous ""cone bra"" Jean Paul Gaultier designed for Madonna -- and the 300 meter high San Cristobal lookout point. Valparaiso . The picturesque seaside resort of Valparaiso is a UNESCO world heritage site and a heaving modern port that is integral to Chile's vast export industry. See also: Singapore on a stopover . A little under two hours from Santiago by road, the town is perched atop a dozen or so hills which offer spectacular vistas out across the Pacific Ocean. Vistors can ""tour (the Chilean poet and author) Pablo Neruda's charming hilltop house, La Sebastiana"" or ""board one of Valparaiso's 15 antique ascensores (elevator cable cars) ... to take in vibrant street art and stunning views over the ocean,"" says Gleeson. Those on a quick stop-off before heading back to Santiago however may make the most of their time by taking ""a quick boat ride from Muelle Prat (harbor) to get a feel for the city,"" Gleeson advises. Observatories . With an average of more than 330 cloudless nights per year, Chile is a near perfect natural laboratory for astronomers and stargazers. It is for this reason the country will host 68 percent of global astronomy infrastructure by 2018, according to the national government. But you don't have to be an acolyte of Alfred Hubble to enjoy the sparkling contents of the Chilean night sky. The Paielan Observatory in the Maipo Valley is just 50 kilometers from Santiago and is surrounded by a spectacular, unspoilt nature reserve. A world class restaurant on the premises meanwhile serves up the latest in contemporary Chilean cuisine, enabling visitors to enjoy fine dining under the stars. Wine regions . Chile is a major exporter of wine and visiting some of its fertile vineyards is a rite of passage for many a connoisseur. See also: Making the most of wine at 35,000 feet . Almost 17 million people drink a glass of Chilean wine every day and the country is the world's largest grape exporter. ""Many travelers opt to visit a few wineries with a specialist like Uncorked Wine Tours,"" says Gleeson. These customized tours include an English-speaking guide, visits to three wineries and a leisurely lunch in wine country. Those looking to go it alone on a wine-tasting odyssey meanwhile can reach some of the lesser visited wineries in the Santiago region by public bus in little over an hour. If you're planning an independent visit, Gleeson warns however, it is wise to log onto the wineries' websites to find out about specialty tastings, picnics, and additional activities before setting out.

"Washington (CNN) -- Jeb Bush says he hasn't made up his mind yet on a 2016 presidential campaign, but that didn't stop him Wednesday from taking a thinly veiled shot at the top contender for the Democratic nomination. Bush, the former governor of Florida, didn't mention former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by name, but Clinton was clearly the butt of his remarks in Colorado: . ""This last week I saw something that was breathtaking. A candidate, a former Secretary of State, who was campaigning in Massachusetts where she said that 'don't let them tell you that businesses creates jobs,'"" Bush said, referring to a line Clinton made last week. While campaigning in Massachusetts Friday, Clinton told the crowd, ""Don't let anybody tell you that it's corporations and businesses that create jobs,"" adding that trickle-down economic policies have ""failed rather spectacularly."" Clinton backpedaled on those remarks three days later explaining that ""our economy grows when businesses and entrepreneurs create good-paying jobs here in America where workers and families are empowered to build from the bottom up and the middle out"" instead of handing ""tax breaks to corporations that outsource jobs."" Republicans have since pounced on the remarks and the former Florida governor also used Clinton's line to build on his own economic vision. ""Well, the problem in America today is that not enough jobs are being created. They are created by businesses where people's income rise where they can live a life of purpose and meaning independent of government. That should be the mission. And the only way that we do that is to create a climate of high sustained economic growth where everybody, everybody in this country has a chance at earned success,"" Bush said. And while that might sound like a stump speech, Bush insists he hasn't made up his mind yet, though he is seriously considering a bid and has met with top donors. His son George P. Bush even said it's ""more than likely that he's giving this a serious thought in moving forward"" last weekend. His father is expected to make a decision after the holiday season. The former governor isn't the only potential GOP presidential candidate who knocked Clinton this week over the jobs comments. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky slammed Clinton earlier this week while campaigning for Republican candidates in Kansas. ""Hillary Clinton comes up and she says, 'Businesses don't create jobs.' Anybody here think businesses don't create jobs?"" Paul said, according to Buzzfeed. ""I'm here today to endorse Pat Roberts and Sam Brownback, because you know what? They know that businesses do create jobs, and I hope you know that too."" Paul also used his time at the mic to tie Clinton's comments to a comment from President Barack Obama on the 2012 campaign trail that was used repeatedly by Republicans to attack the president during his reelection bid. ""The president says, 'you didn't build that, it just sort of happened,'"" Paul said. Obama's comment that ""if you've got a business, you didn't build that"" during a campaign rally in 2012 came while Obama was talking about the importance of infrastructure and public services. The remark caused the Obama campaign quite a headache in 2012, and it looks like Clinton's comments on jobs could have the same impact in 2016, if she were to run.","While campaigning in Colorado, Bush hit Clinton over her comments that businesses don't create jobs .
Clinton later walked back those remarks saying tax breaks for corporations don't spur economic growth .
But that hasn't stopped Bush and Sen. Rand Paul from hitting Clinton over the quote ."
"(CNN) -- Much is being made of Hillary Clinton's recent remarks about leaving the White House ""dead broke"" and how she and Bill aren't like those who are ""truly well off"" despite earning more than $100 million together since 2001. And now she's getting heat for the $225,000 in speaking fees she's getting for a Nevada speech. Apparently when prescribing a vision for America that divides us along the lines of class and income, the medicine always tastes better when taken by someone else. But setting politics aside, much should be made of these comments simply because they demonstrate that many of those who rail against economic freedom are out of touch and have a fundamental misunderstanding of how jobs and wealth are created in this country. Opinion: Petty attacks on Hillary just won't matter . Let's start with the basics. All Americans, regardless of who they are or where they come from, want a good-paying job with more opportunity, choice and control over their economic and personal futures. But this is more than a common desire shared by all Americans. History shows that this time-tested formula is the key to upward mobility and a healthy economy -- in other words, wealth creation. It must be nice to get paid millions of dollars to write a book about yourself, just as it must be nice to get paid millions of dollars to sink three-pointers in the NBA Playoffs or to star in a Hollywood summer blockbuster. But athletes and entertainers, like the Clintons, are notable exceptions. Let me be clear -- I'm not criticizing them for their financial success. After all, they all have unique skill sets that few others possess, so the laws of supply and demand apply. Most American success stories, and the jobs that result, involve hardworking individuals and families who take significant personal and financial risk, work from sunrise to sunset and persevere through good times and bad. This is Main Street success -- the bedrock our country was built on. We all can name countless shining examples of entrepreneurs, inventors and innovators who took those risks, invested in their local companies and created jobs. These Americans -- these job creators -- are the same people Hillary Clinton calls ""truly wealthy."" Others, like President Barack Obama, continually attack, criticize and stigmatize the success these individuals achieved through hard work. This might make for good politics and help distract from the numerous scandals and poor economic outlook reported on the nightly news, but it is a terrible way to treat fellow Americans, especially when the economy continues to struggle and job creation remains weak. Now Hillary Clinton is no novice, so I suspect her pollsters will inform her that she fumbled the ball on this one, and her advisers will counsel her to shift the discussion back to something like income inequality. It will be good for this country to have an honest discussion about income inequality, but let's address it in a way without demonizing the success and entrepreneurial spirit that helps solidify the backbone of this country. Too many Americans are suffering and living paycheck-to-paycheck while trying to make ends meet. Family budgets are getting tighter as prices for gas and groceries keep rising. Rather than responding to these harsh realities with the politics of division and distraction and pitting Americans against each other for political gain, Washington should work toward real, commonsense solutions that help create jobs for hardworking families. We need efficient and more effective programs that won't bankrupt our government and drag down our economy. We need a shift in focus from empty promises, handouts and shallow accusations to education, job training and encouragement toward hard work and entrepreneurship. In other words, to paraphrase a Democratic operative, ""It's about opportunity, stupid."" As America's economy continues to struggle, Main Street success in America, now more than ever, should be encouraged, not attacked. Strider: Petty attacks on Hillary just won't matter .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Spain's Fernando Alonso has torn up his contract at McLaren and quit the Formula One team after a stormy year which has seen him deposed as world champion. Alonso clashed with teammate Hamilton and team boss Dennis in a difficult 2007. Alonso, who finished third in the 2007 standings behind teammate Lewis Hamilton and new champion Kimi Raikkonen, is now free to join another team . A source with knowledge of the Alonso-McLaren talks told CNN that it is not yet known where Alonso will go next. The 26-year-old has been linked with a return to his former team Renault or may sit out 2008 awaiting a possible spot at Italian giants Ferrari. Alonso, who had two years left on his contract with British-based McLaren, courted controversy for his strained relationship with Hamilton and team boss Ron Dennis and his departure appeared almost inevitable. ""Since I was a boy I had always wanted to drive for McLaren, but sometimes in life things do not work out,"" said Alonso in a statement released by the team. ""I continue to believe that McLaren is a great team. Yes, we have had our ups and downs during the season, which has made it extra-challenging for all of us, and it is not a secret that I never really felt at home. ""I know there have been suggestions of favoritism within the team and people say a lot of things in the heat of battle, but in the end I was always provided with an equal opportunity to win."" Dennis added: ""Everybody at Vodafone McLaren Mercedes, especially McLaren's Spanish partners Banco Santander and Mutua Madrilena and the team's title partner Vodafone, want to wish Fernando all the best for the future."" Alonso has been in intense negotiations over his early exit with McLaren, who said on their Web site that he had left ""in the best interests of both parties."" The 2007 season had started promisingly for McLaren, but rookie Hamilton's early successes appeared to unsettle Alonso as the title race boiled down to a four-way race between the McLaren drivers and Ferrari's Raikkonen and Felipe Massa. The first clear sign of friction occurred at the Hungarian Grand Prix in August  when Alonso was accused of preventing Hamilton from completing a final qualifying lap. He was demoted from pole position to sixth on the grid by race stewards. More serious was the Formula One 'spy scandal' which saw McLaren fined over $100 million by the sports governing body, the FIA. During the FIA investigation it was alleged Alonso had threatened to go the FIA with sensitive information and Dennis revealed that he had not spoken to Alonso in several weeks. A fragile peace was established for the championship decider at the Brazil GP, but it proved a disastrous finale for McLaren as neither Hamilton or Alonso could secure the points they needed to win the title and Raikkonen prevailed.

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- At least nine people died in shootouts over the weekend in northeastern Mexico, an area where two drug cartels have been waging a bloody war since January. Eight people were killed early Sunday in the municipality of Miguel Aleman in Tamaulipas state, the state government said on its Web site. Five died inside a bar and three others were killed in a motor vehicle, the government said. One gang-related death was recorded in the municipality Saturday during a firefight between soldiers and a group of armed men, the government's information center said. The area, which borders Texas, has seen ferocious fighting between the Zetas and Gulf cartels after a recent gangland slaying. Hours-long gun battles are common, and U.S. officials were recently forced to temporarily close the consulate in Reynosa, another city in Tamaulipas state. On Monday, the U.S. State Department issued a travel warning to inform U.S. citizens traveling to and living in Mexico of concerns about the security situation in the nation. The State Department issued a similar warning in March. The trouble in Tamaulipas and neighboring Nuevo Leon state started January 18, when Gulf cartel members killed top Zeta lieutenant Victor Mendoza. The Zetas demanded that the Gulf cartel turn over the killers, but the narco group refused. The Zetas, composed mostly of former elite military troops, had been the armed enforcers for the Gulf cartel since 2001. They have become more independent in recent years, and the all-out war between the two cartels indicates the split is apparently permanent. Mexican authorities said Monday that the Gulf cartel has reached an alliance with the Familia Michoacana drug organization to fight the Zetas. Federal police made the observation in an announcement about the arrest of a top Familia Michoacana lieutenant and two other suspects. Cartel suspect Jose Manuel Cuevas Arias, known as ""el Borrego,"" was the Michoacan organization's leader in the state of Guanajuato, the federal police agency said on its Web site. The other two suspects were identified as Rafael Rosales Cuevas, 32, alias ""el Aguacate,"" and Luis Alberto Farias Ruiz, 22, known as ""la Lore."" The states of Michoacan and Guanajuato border each other in southern Mexico. Cuevas Arias, 31, is accused in the deaths of four federal police officers, the agency said. He was incarcerated twice in the United States, sentenced in Moreno Valle, California, in 2000 for the production of amphetamine and later for illegal entry into the country, Mexican federal police said. He was sentenced to two years for the illegal entry and was released in 2007, the federal police said. The weekend violence in Tamaulipas  was the latest in a string of bloody killings in the state. Earlier this month, five men and two women were killed in the city of Tampico. The most violent day this year occurred March 30, when 18 people died in drug-related violence, the state government said. No official figures are available, but media tallies this year say more than 17,000 people have been killed nationwide since Mexican President Felipe Calderon declared war on the drug cartels shortly after taking office in December 2006. Ciudad Juarez, in northern Mexico across from El Paso, Texas, is the most violent city in the nation, with more than 2,600 drug-related deaths in 2009. No official numbers are available, but more than 400 killings have been reported by local media this year. The city, long the focal point of Calderon's battle against cartels, came to renewed prominence after the January 31 killings of 15 people, most of them students with no links to organized crime. The massacre sparked outrage throughout Mexico and drew worldwide attention. In another incident that drew widespread attention, three people associated with the U.S. Consulate in Juarez were gunned down in two shootings last month. Two of the victims, including a pregnant woman, were U.S. citizens living in El Paso, Texas. Two graduate students apparently killed in crossfire between Mexican military and drug gang members in Nuevo Leon state also garnered much attention last month. Nuevo Leon borders Tamaulipas and also has seen widespread violence because of the battle between the Gulf and Zetas cartels. The Mexican government apologized to the families of the two students and promised an investigation into how they were killed.","Zeta, Gulf cartels have been waging a bloody war in northeastern Mexico .

"Washington (CNN) -- House Republican leaders are aiming to delay a challenge to President Barack Obama's controversial immigration executive order until early next year in an effort to avoid a government shutdown next week, multiple House GOP members and aides told CNN. Speaker John Boehner announced the strategy in a closed-door meeting of House Republicans Tuesday, where it was largely well-received by rank and file GOP members, although some conservatives are pressing for changes, according to multiple sources. Many members say they are still reviewing the details. At a news conference afterwards, Boehner said his members realize their hands are tied on the immigration issue until Republicans control both chambers of Congress in January. ""I think they understand that it's going to be difficult to take meaningful action as long as we got Democrat control of the Senate,"" Boehner said. Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican in line to become the next Senate majority leader, reiterated his view that the GOP should stop threatening shutdowns. ""We need to quit that kind of rattling the economy,"" McConnell said Tuesday at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council. The government will run out of money on Dec. 11 unless Congress acts. Last year's government shutdown was politically disastrous for Republicans and the party is trying to avoid a repeat just as they're on the cusp of retaking full control of Congress for the first time in nearly a decade. The GOP plan discussed on Tuesday calls for the House to vote on legislation that would fund most of the government through September while only funding the Department of Homeland Security, which would carry out key parts of the executive orders, until just sometime in March. That would give Republicans time to pass legislation blocking the immigration orders. House Republican leaders are trying to balance competing priorities in the party. They want to mollify conservatives who are furious over the President's decision to make it easier for millions of undocumented immigrants to stay in the country by providing a clear opportunity for them to try to block the action. After hearing about the plan Tuesday morning, some of those House members on the right say they will oppose it because it would continue funding for agencies tasked with granting new visas through March of next year. ""You just want me to fund the unconstitutional act for 60 days? Kind of like being a little bit pregnant? It doesn't work for me,"" Arizona GOP Rep Matt Salmon told reporters. But other Republicans -- including leaders in both chambers -- are fearful of tying that move to government funding. Arkansas GOP Rep. Steve Womack said now that voters gave his party control of both the House and Senate in the midterms it's was important to demonstrate that they can govern and not ""give any opportunity for buyer's remorse on the part of the discerning electorate."" He said there was a ""narrow window"" for Republicans to show they can run the government before voters size up the parties again before the 2016 election. A vote on the bill is likely next week, aides said. Testifying before a House committee on Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson urged lawmakers against legislation that would fund his department for a shorter period of time than the rest of the government. ""That is, in my judgment, a very bad idea for Homeland Security because during that period ..., we cannot engage in new starts,"" Johnson said. ""For example, we are back in a presidential election cycle. I cannot hire new Secret Service agents until I get an appropriations bill passed by this Congress -- not another (continuing resolution) for a couple of months."" Senate Democrats generally support the President's immigration orders and oppose the House plan to fund DHS just through March. But after meeting with his caucus Tuesday, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid it would be a ""big accomplishment"" if the House passed a bill that funded most of the government and signaled he would support it. Separately, the House likely will vote this week on a bill that essentially calls out Obama on immigration. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Robert Goodlatte is reworking a proposal drafted by Florida Republican Rep. Ted Yoho of Florida. That bill would allow members to ""vent"" about their unhappiness with the executive action and assert that what Obama did was unconstitutional. Illinois Republican Rep. Peter Roskam said the separate vote declaring the president violated the Constitution by using executive authority on immigration is to demonstrate to constituents that the GOP opposed the president's actions. ""Silence is assent so to not respond in any way is in some fashion to be complicit in it, so this allows members to be on the record and clear about it."" However, the bill would have not legal binding authority and the Senate is sure to ignore it. Salmon said he would vote for the bill because he opposed the president's immigration actions, but then he essentially dismissed it, saying, ""it's not going to go anywhere and everyone's knows it."" In addition to the funding strategy, House GOP members are also still considering whether they should sue the President for the issuing the directives that they consider unconstitutional.

"(CNN) -- Nico Rosberg survived an investigation by race stewards to claim a controversial pole position for the Monaco Grand Prix Saturday ahead of disgruntled Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton. They ruled there was ""no evidence of any offence"" after several hours of mulling over an incident which happened at the back end of the qualifying session. Both men were on their last flying laps when Rosberg lost control of his car and took to the escape road at Mirabeau. Hamilton, who was behind him and two hundredths of a second ahead on the first sector timings, was forced to slow up as yellow flags were waived and eventually abandoned his effort. It meant Rosberg's one minute 15.989 clocking from his penultimate run gave him first place on the grid, with Hamilton 0.059 seconds slower from a previous effort. But it left Hamilton clearly fuming and insisting at the post-qualifying press conference that he was ""on target"" to take pole before his teammate went off. Rosberg claimed he had ""tried to push just that little bit more and went over the edge,"" refuting any suggestion that it had been a deliberate ploy to deny Hamilton his chance of pole. The German, who lives in Monte Carlo, was nevertheless delighted to have taken pole on the famous circuit for the second straight year. ""I'm really, really happy -- to be on pole at home is fantastic, it couldn't be better,"" he added. Behind the all-conquering Mercedes pair it was Australian Daniel Ricciardo who again got the better of Red Bull teammate and four-time defending champion Sebastian Vettel for third and fourth on the grid. Two-time former world champion Fernando Alonso will occupy the third row ahead of his Ferrari teammate Kimi Raikkonen. Frenchman Jean-Eric Vergne of Toro Rosso and Danish rookie Kevin Magnussen of McLaren were seventh and eighth fastest . Another rookie, Russian Daniil Kvyat in the second Toro Rosso was ninth and Mexican Sergio Perez completed the top 10 for Force India. Hamilton leads Rosberg by three points in the title race after winning the last four races, but pole position on the tight street circuit in Monte Carlo virtually guarantees victory come Sunday's race. Rosberg took the season-opener in Australia when Hamilton failed to finish, but has had to settle for second place to the Briton in the last four rounds, with signs of tension between the two men in their own private battle for the world championship. After the late incident the atmosphere in the interview area appeared distinctly frosty with 2008 champion Hamilton giving short answers to questions on the subject.

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- He was born in Saudi Arabia and spent much of his youth in New York and south Florida. Then he vanished. Investigators now allege that Adnan Shukrijumah has risen to a key position in al Qaeda's leadership. The FBI says that after he left America, Shukrijumah started off as an al Qaeda dishwasher, doing menial tasks at training camps. But he's much more than a dishwasher now, according to investigators. ""It's like any other business. He would be equated with being the chief of operations,"" says Brian LeBlanc, a special agent for the FBI. As the alleged director of al Qaeda's overseas operations, investigators believe he is ""extremely dangerous,"" LeBlanc says. ""He may not be someone who's going to come into the United States to conduct the attack, but what makes him more dangerous is he's out there plotting the attacks and recruiting people to actively do that,"" LeBlanc says. The breakthrough came when LeBlanc, an FBI counter-terrorism agent, linked Shukrijumah to the thwarted New York subway suicide mission last fall -- the biggest post-9/11 terror investigation. Najibullah Zazi and Zarein Ahmedzay admitted they planned to blow themselves up using homemade bombs. Prosecutors say it was Shukrijumah who called the shots -- probably from somewhere along the Afghan-Pakistan border. ""[Shukrijumah] was the one that convinced ... them to come back to the United States and conduct the attack here,"" LeBlanc says. But Shukrijumah's mother -- who did not wish to be named in order to protect her privacy -- says authorities are using her son as a scapegoat. ""That is not my son. My son is not a violent person. He is very kind, generous,"" she says. Shukrijumah -- the eldest son of a Saudi Imam -- came to America as a young child. They settled in Brooklyn, New York, where his father preached at a mosque. They lived at a nearby house before moving to Florida in the mid-'90s. His father, who is now dead, opened a small mosque near Fort Lauderdale. Meanwhile, Shukrijumah worked at odd jobs, including selling used cars. His family says it's how he paid for courses, including computers and chemistry, at a small college in South Florida. He even took classes to improve his English. A few years later, when the FBI said they wanted to find him, Shukrijumah's English professor remembered videotaping him in class and turned over the tape to the FBI. That proved crucial six years later. On a hunch, LeBlanc asked agents in New York to show that video of Shukrijumah to would-be bomber Zazi. ""From that video, he was able to make an identification,"" LeBlanc says. The FBI says it now has a more detailed profile of Shukrijumah in part, from 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed. Just before 9/11, the FBI says Shukrijumah crossed the U.S. by train. Later, he scoped out the Panama Canal as a target. He went to Trinidad, London and -- by June 2001 -- Afghanistan. On 9/11, his mother says he called home for the last time. ""He called me and he said, 'Did you hear what happened with so and so and so?' He said, 'They're putting it on the Muslims. I said, 'yes.'"" She says she told him not to come home. ""And he was arguing with me. He said, 'No, I didn't do nothing. I will come, don't worry about this,'"" she recalls. After that, she says, she never heard from him again. Shukrijumah's mother adamantly denies her son is directing al Qaeda attacks. But when asked about Faisal Shahzad -- who has pleaded guilty to federal terrorism charges in the attempted car bomb attack in Times Square in May -- she says that sometimes ""you have to do something very alarming for the people to wake up."" ""It's not because you hate them or you want to destroy them or you want to hurt them,"" she says. When asked if she has a message to send her son, she says she has nothing to say. ""He [has] his own guide in his own heart,"" she says. For the FBI, it's all about staying one step ahead. Where will al Qaeda -- and their alleged chief of operations -- strike next? ""He's definitely focused on attacking the United States and other western countries,"" LeBlanc says. The FBI believes Shukrijumah is likely in Pakistan's lawless tribal region of Waziristan. Shukrijumah moved up the ladder after two others who directed outside operations for al Qaeda were killed in suspected U.S. drone attacks, the FBI says.","FBI says Adnan Shukrijumah started out as a dishwasher and worked his way up .

"(CNN) -- A powerful snowstorm barreled east through the Midwest on Sunday, bringing with it more precipitation and gusty winds and leaving behind a trail of significant damage, large snow drifts and subarctic temperatures, according to the National Weather Service. Winter storm warnings and advisories Sunday extended as far west as Illinois, as far east as Pennsylvania, and as far south as northern Alabama and Georgia. Meanwhile, residents of the upper Midwest who braved at-times blizzard conditions on Saturday faced the prospect Sunday night of wind chills dipping, in spots, as low as 30 degrees below zero. This comes after up to 23 inches of snow fell in parts of Minnesota and as many as 18.5 inches in Wisconsin since Friday. ""We could see wind chills (that are) obviously extremely dangerous for people, to have that kind of exposure for any length of time,"" said Tod Pritchard, a spokesman for the Wisconsin Emergency Management agency. See road conditions in severely affected states: Illinois, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota . After prompting the closure of highways in Iowa, South Dakota, Minnesota and elsewhere a day earlier, the storm wreaked havoc with air travel Sunday. About 1,375 flights in and out of Chicago's O'Hare airport had been canceled as of 4:45 p.m. (5:45 p.m. ET), the city's aviation department reported, with delays for travelers heading to and from the Windy City averaging around just over 6 hours. Another 300 flights had been canceled at nearby Midway airport. ""The main problem ... right now is the winds,"" said Chicago Department of Aviation spokeswoman Karen Pride. ""The winds are very high and gusting very strongly, and we do have lake-effect snow as well."" The headaches, though, went far beyond Chicago. On Sunday evening, Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson and Newark, New Jersey's Liberty airports reported delays of roughly two-and-a-half hours, slightly longer than that experienced at Boston's Logan airport, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Those were just a few of the many airports, and many more flights, affected as high winds, low visibility and heavy snow crippled traffic for a second straight day. Delta Air Lines spokeswoman Leslie Parker said as of 5 p.m., the airline had canceled 748 flights nationwide. American Airlines had called off 272 departures from O'Hare, out of more than 400 nationwide, said spokeswoman Mary Frances Fagas. iReport: Treacherous conditions in Minnesota . United had canceled about 350 departures, mostly from Chicago, an airline spokeswoman said, while partner Continental nixed 125 such flights from Chicago, Cleveland, Ohio, and Newark, New Jersey. JetBlue canceled 128 flights due to the storm, said spokesman Mateo Lleras. The pounding snow caused the roof of the 64,000-seat Metrodome in Minneapolis to ""deflate"" Sunday morning, Minnesota State Patrol spokesman Lt. Eric Roeske said. Workers wielding shovels could be seen clearing the roof of the heavy white stuff, while photos from inside the darkened stadium showed much of the field covered with snow that fell from a gaping hole in the dome. ""Obviously the weight of the snow would affect how much air pressure is necessary to keep that roof up,"" Roeske said. ""Something caused that air pressure not to be strong enough or high enough to keep that roof at its normal position."" Roy Terwilliger, chairman of the Minneapolis Metro Sports Commission -- the group that oversees the Metrodome -- said the heavy snow and cold, high winds ""was too much pressure on the dome and several panels on the Teflon roof were caused to rip."" Sunday's game between the hometown Minneapolis Vikings and New York Giants has been pushed to Monday at 7:20 p.m. ET and moved 540 miles southeast to Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan, the NFL said in a statement Sunday. All those with tickets to the originally scheduled game would get preferred seating near the 50-yard line and free tickets would be distributed, the league said. Even with the snow and winds subsiding, road travel remained perilous in much of Minnesota. St. Paul, for one, declared a second snow emergency through early Monday to expedite plowing of city streets. ""The big problem is ice under the snow, making it really slick and really hazardous,"" said St. Clair resident Alan Scott. In Wisconsin, Gov. Jim Doyle declared a state of emergency for 72 counties to facilitate the movement of emergency resources and personnel who were activated Saturday, he said in a statement. We Energies reported 10,000 power outages across the state Sunday, said Barry McNulty, a spokesman for the company. In Iowa, snow had subsided in some areas but emergency workers were coping with more than 1,000 power outages, a state emergency spokesman said. Greyhound bus service along the Omaha-Des Moines route was expected to resume later Sunday. Some bus travelers at the Des Moines bus station had been stuck there since Saturday night. Greyhound spokeswoman Maureen Richmond said pizza was brought in for those passengers due to the inconvenience. Patti Thompson, a spokeswoman for the emergency services in Illinois, said Sunday that northern counties were getting the worst of the weather Sunday afternoon and that Department of Transportation teams were working to clear roads. No power outages have been reported, she said. While many states saw snow Sunday, the expected accumulation of a few inches in most locales paled compared to what hit Wisconsin and Minnesota and Wisconsin, according to National Weather Service forecasters. The reach of the storm system continues to expand. Hard freeze warnings, for instance, extended as far south as Florida, with the weather service forecasting 13-degree wind chills on Monday night in Tallahassee. Still, not everyone in the United States was shivering. Parts of southern California were experiencing record-warm temperatures with high temperatures Sunday above 80 degrees. CNN's T.J. Holmes, Helena DeMoura and Adam Shivers contributed to this report.","NEW: Airlines cancel hundreds of flights due to high winds, snow and low visibility .

"(CNN) -- ""Take deep breaths,"" I tell my son. The irony of the instruction isn't lost on me after he begins to explain why he is so upset. It's the end of a long day -- dark way before I think it should be, as the cold hasn't quite taken full hold in Atlanta. I got the text from Dr. Adams just before 3 p.m. Once my abnormal psychology professor, now a super colleague in the department, her message read, ""No indictment ... disbelieving."" But I had come to terms with this injustice visited on Eric Garner and the rest of us -- at least in my mind. I'd compartmentalized things since the week before with the no-indictment in Ferguson, Missouri. I clinically went about lecturing and working with my students from Spelman and Morehouse in thinking through their protest of solidarity with Ferguson and the epidemic extrajudicial killings of black folks. They began their ""Make it Matter"" protest last Tuesday at the foot of the Martin Luther King statue on Morehouse's campus and moved on to CNN Center a few miles away. I was proud. Teary-eyed. They lifted me up. I'd brought my kid to work that day. And this is when I would begin a focused dialogue with him, in 7-year-old-speak, about the situation in Ferguson, Michael Brown and issues of race and social justice. The little guy took it just fine, asked a few questions for clarity and then concluded, ""but if a police officer is supposed to protect the people and then he shoots a teenager because he's afraid of him, even though the teenager doesn't have a gun, then [the police officer]'s a brute."" Exactly. And since then, I've talked with, taught and consoled students on campus, reflecting on the tumult I experienced some 22 years prior in the aftermath of the police beating of Rodney King. Eric Garner's killing is an amped-up, 21st-century manifestation of that violence with an echo of past New York cases like those of Yusuf Hawkins, Michael Griffith and William Turks. Still, I've resisted putting it all together. Donovan X. Ramsey explained it to me so well last month with his essay ""Without Sanctuary."" But then my son, voice quivering after the long day, said, ""I've been thinking about the problems in the world."" Wow. I knew he was too cool about this last week. ""And Mike Brown, and people don't like other people because of their skin,"" he continues, before collapsing between the front and back seat, sobbing into my arms. ""Breathe,"" I say, using every ounce of physical strength I have not to cry with him. Not right now. He doesn't even know about the failure to indict Officer Pantaleo in New York on Tuesday. ""The world is better already because of people like you,"" I say as I begin to re-frame the conversation. ""You know what's right and what's wrong, and so do the students that you met last week. And we're all going to be kind to one another, study and figure how to make it better."" I sounded very convincing, as parents are supposed to. The academic year started with the police killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, and the semester ends with the decision that these were somehow legal. This weighs heavy for so many. In the bubble we build at Morehouse College we hold up young black men. We work to show them the best parts of who they are, making conspicuous a humanity that the body politic refuses to see as the norm. That's the core of the work that we do. But it's a hard sell when the young people you reason with note that you can be shot to death in broad daylight, or choked to death on camera because white folks are scared of you. Still, the truth is that black men and women and black kids -- girls and boys -- are not disposable. We are of value. We are not objects. Breathe. Of course, this is as much a mantra for me as it is instruction to my boy. Breathe, and then let's continue to do the work.","David Wall Rice: I've taught and consoled students over police killings .

"(CNN) -- A day after North Korea test-fired two missiles, South Korea captured a fishing boat from the North that had crossed into South Korean waters, officials say. The boat crossed the sea demarcation line that separates the two Koreas and was captured by the South Korean navy Thursday, the South Korean Ministry of Defense said. The action comes as tensions between the two Koreas are rising once again. On Wednesday, North Korea tested two medium-range ballistic missiles, firing them into the ocean. South Korea says it believes the missile tests are a reaction to ongoing U.S.-South Korean military drills. North Korea had harsh words for the South, accusing it of provocations. ""The puppet military gangsters perpetrated such provocations as firing bullets and shells from the areas around the five islands including Paekryong and Big Yonphyong islands and scattering leaflets hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK on March 24,"" the North Korean news agency KCNA reported.

"(CNN) -- ""You are my duchess"" was one of the first catcalls Elana Adler wrote down in 2008, after she got into the habit of jotting down the unwanted attention she received from strangers in the streets of New York. Something about it seemed so ""dated,"" she said, and it stuck with her. So would many more of the icky comments from strangers, prompting her to keep a running log of them. Most of the time, she does not respond, and the callers usually seem annoyed by her silence. When she has responded, the outcome is usually, "" 'Who, me? What did I do? How dare you respond to me like that?' "" she recalls. ""I never understood what the callers really wanted to get out of it."" Finally, she decided to do something with them. She began cross-stitching them into samplers in what she calls an effort to reduce ""the complex emotional experience"" of being taunted with harassing, vulgar sentiments into ""a simple piece of women's work."" A sampler is a decorative piece of embroidery, traditionally included in a hope chest, that demonstrates proficiency in needlework. It also requires a lot of time and concentration. ""I wanted to laboriously and painstakingly give attention to all these phrases that were verbally thrown at me in a moment,"" she said. ""Needlepoint made sense to me because of its connotations and how it historically references women's work. I also liked the idea of how laborious it was. That these statements would stick to me or be in my mind for a very long time."" She has created 32 samplers for the series, ""You are my duchess."" She started out with simple words. Now she creates designs around the words, in what she calls the ""beautification"" of an assault. ""The first time I made one, well, I just sat down and started. Then I wondered why I was doing it because it was going to take so long. At that point, looking at one little embroidered phrase that had taken me 8-plus hours to make, well, I wondered how far I would get doing it. I just wanted to have a large collection of them. Power in numbers. ""The more I did them, the bigger and more detailed I wanted them. Now, if I want to start one, I cannot help but think big. Big is good, but it takes a long time.""

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- China's new paramount leader, Xi Jinping, is making the fight against corruption his No. 1 mission. In several speeches since he took over the reins of the Communist Party last November, he has warned that corruption could lead to ""the collapse of the Party and the downfall of the state."" Xi sees corruption as a threat to the party's legitimacy. He exhorted fellow leaders to learn from the experience of other countries where ""corruption has played a big role in conflicts that grew over lengthy periods, and ... led to popular discontent, social unrest and the overthrow of the political power."" He did not mention names, but clearly he was referring to Libya, Egypt and other authoritarian and corrupt regimes that have been overthrown in the wake of the Arab Spring revolutions. Xi urged officials to ""build a clean government, show self-discipline and restrain their relatives and associates."" Chosen to lead the cleanup is Wang Qishan, 64, who until recently was China's economic-finance czar and now is chief of the Party's anti-corruption body. Wang, also known as a ""firefighter,"" is a no-nonsense, blunt-talking administrator and has been a go-to trouble shooter. In the 1990s, he was sent to Guangdong to clean up the ""debt crisis"" in the southern province. Years later, he was dispatched to Hainan province to curb rampant smuggling and corruption. In 2003, he was called to Beijing to replace the city mayor accused of covering up the SARS crisis, the massive pandemic that spread across China and beyond. Wang's political skills will be put to test in his new job. Corruption has long been a major public complaint, and there is certainly no shortage of cases. In the past five years, China has punished 668,400 people for ""Party discipline violations"" and more than 24,600 suspects have been referred for investigation, according to China Daily. There are various ways to acquire ill-gotten wealth and just as many to hide them. Some spirit millions of cash out of the country. Others stash them in luxury villas, expensive jewelries and accessories -- or business ventures by relatives and associates. Still others blow their loot enjoying sybaritic lifestyles, lavishing wealth on mistresses or simply gambling it away in casinos. Disgraced politicians include: . - A lowly bureaucrat who despite a modest salary has been found to be wearing expensive-looking watches on various occasions. Internet watchdogs have dubbed him ""Brother Watch."" - A senior official now known as ""Uncle House"" who was found by government officials to own 21 houses despite being on a meager income. - A district Communist Party chief in Chongqing, who was fired after being caught on video having sex with a young woman who was alleged to be a prostitute. - The former chief of China Railway Container Transport, who was sacked and accused of receiving bribes of 47 million yuan ($7.5 million) between 2005 and 2010. - The Sichuan provincial deputy secretary who was removed for alleged ""serious discipline violations,"" the most senior official to have fallen since the new leaders took over in November. To be sure, China has been making efforts to crack down on graft. From May 2011, the amended Criminal Law criminalizes bribery of foreign government officials and officials of international public organizations. It also regulates the use of gift cards to curb money laundering, illegal cash withdrawals, tax evasion and bribery. The current solution largely focuses on punishment instead of prevention -- ""Kill the chicken to scare the monkey,"" as the Chinese put it. Execute one and deter 100. Prevention, experts say, is better than investigation and punishment. In a recent meeting, Wang said ""trust can never replace supervision."" He is now calling for ""institutional prevention and punishment of corruption."" Wang recently summoned eight experts to solicit ideas. Most advocated a system of requiring party officials to disclose their assets. In fact, the notion of public disclosure of official's assets was proposed some 18 years ago. Wang Quanjie (no relation to Politburo member Wang Qishan), then a delegate to the National People's Congress, China's legislature, submitted three bills proposing the idea in 1994, . ""Public disclosure of property in China is really difficult, and it's especially difficult to make it a system. Our goal is to establish a system, not just punish some people,"" he said in December . He Jiahong, a professor at Renmin University and an expert on corruption, proposes a form of amnesty that will give officials until the end of 2013 to declare their assets publicly. Those who do so will be exempted from punishment for any acts of corruption. Hong Kong's government adopted a similar move in 1977 to root out mafia-related corruption in what was then a colonial state. Wang supports the idea but agrees that persuading officials to come clean will be next to impossible. In fact, about one million officials of certain rank are already required to report their assets -- but only internally. ""After the declarations are made, they are kept in a black box, and they become scrap of paper,"" He of Renmin University complained. Wang, the delegate, says the key is making asset declarations accessible to the public. ""If the common people cannot find out their assets, if nobody except themselves knows the truth, it cannot solve the problem."" ""It's like asking the left hand to supervise the right hand, or asking the mother to supervise her son,"" he added. ""It's impossible for the mother to send the son to the police when he commits the crime."" Eighteen years after Wang first proposed his ""sunshine policy,"" it still remains on the drawing board. Small wonder many Chinese doubt the government's sincerity in fighting corruption. Bloggers point out that, by contrast, the legislature took only a few days to deliberate and pass a new law that requires Internet users to register under their real names. The new law is meant to crack down on Internet scams and junk mail and ""protect the public from baseless and libelous accusations."" But critics say it will merely blunt the power of the microblogging site Weibo, which whistleblowers use to expose cases under pseudonyms without fear of retribution or punishment. In the absence of the ""sunshine law,"" muckraking Chinese turn to the Internet to expose official abuse. Despite heavy government restrictions and self-censorship, internet activists have cleverly used Weibo to spot and expose corrupt officials. China now has over 400 million Weibo users, and microblogs have become ""an inescapable snare for corrupt officials,"" according to the official Xinhua News Agency. ""The miraculous microblogs have become the nightmare of the corrupted.""","New leader Xi sees corruption as a threat to the Party's legitimacy .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court kicked off its new term with some drama on the same-sex marriage front, and a bit of confusion mixed into the proceedings. By tradition, Chief Justice John Roberts -- joined by his eight colleagues -- took to the bench at 10 a.m. and announced the end of the old term and the start of the new, welcoming new lawyers to the court's bar and holding a one-hour argument on a search and seizure case. But many reporters and court observers were downstairs, preoccupied trying to make sense of a surprise move. In brief orders, the justices without explanation announced they had rejected appeals from five states seeking to keep their bans on same-sex marriage in place. Those states are Utah, Oklahoma, Virginia, Indiana and Wisconsin. The practical effect means gay and lesbian couples in those states could soon become legally wed. Virginia announced it would start issuing marriage licenses within hours of the court's action. And because the lower court rulings in these cases are not being reviewed by the Supreme Court, that means similar same-sex marriage bans in six other neighboring states could soon fall in coming weeks. Those states are Colorado, Kansas, Wyoming, West Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Almost no one predicted the justices would do what they did. Many legal analysts and advocates on both sides of the marriage fight suggested the court would either jump in now and decide the constitutional equal protection questions -- or put off consideration of those appeals and the larger issues indefinitely. That is what most members of the press thought when the court issued its order list Monday, a summary of the cases rejected for review. Those appeals from the five states were not on the paper copies given to journalists promptly at 9:30 a.m. Opinion: How Supreme Court's non-decision helps gay marriage . Turns out that the 81-page orders list was missing 30 pages -- including the section where the same-sex marriage appeals were noted. That was a simple printing error, but some reporters went upstairs to hear oral arguments in the second-floor courtroom, thinking no action had been taken on same-sex marriage. By the time the complete orders came out, and the marriage cases were suddenly noted, chaos (and some cursing) ensued as reporters rushed to get the news out. The complete orders list was posted online on the court's websites several minutes later for the general public to scan. The nine-member bench has the complete discretion to accept or reject any petition presented to it, and the justices are under no deadline to make those calls. The fact they rejected for review the appeals from the five states now was a clear signal the court was not ready to get involved. Nearly every federal and state court in the past 15 months has struck down same-sex marriage bans. One scenario was that the court wants to take a go-slow approach with the marriage equality debate, concluding that since lower courts are all but in agreement, the justices need not get involved at this point. It seems inevitable the issue will be decided. The court's deliberate move to stay out for now makes this a question not of if, but of when.","The Supreme Court declines to wade into marriage battles in five states .
As a result, lower court rulings stand and same-sex couples can now marry in those states .

"(CNN) -- Peter Bogdanovich would like to thank a man he never met. The man's name was James Blakely, and he was a member of the editorial department at 20th Century Fox. He loved musicals and Cole Porter, and was primed to like ""At Long Last Love,"" Bogdanovich's Porter-infused musical. After the 1975 film flopped, Blakely quietly decided to recut it. ""Obviously he took one look at what we'd done and said, 'These guys are screwing up the movie. I'm going to fix it.' And he was right,"" says Bogdanovich in an interview. ""And he took his time and did it right and saved the movie from the garbage can."" The film is now out on Blu-ray. Bogdanovich, who's preparing a new film produced by Noah Baumbach and Wes Anderson, took a few minutes to talk to CNN about ""At Long Last Love,"" the value of previews and his thoughts on today's Hollywood. The following is an edited version of the conversation. CNN: Tell me how ""At Long Last Love"" came to be. Peter Bogdanovich: I was reading through (a Cole Porter book) Cybill (Shepherd, his then partner) gave me, and enjoying the lyrics, and thought maybe I should write a musical based on these lyrics. And then I read one of the songs, a very unfamiliar song and not a very famous one, called ""I Loved Him (but He Didn't Love Me)."" It sort of gave me the idea for the whole picture. CNN: Burt Reynolds was unusual casting. Bogdanovich: I didn't have Burt Reynolds in mind. I was thinking of Elliott Gould, who was a song and dance man, and then Sue Mengers became Burt Reynolds' agent, and she was my agent, and she said, ""Why don't you use Burt?"" So I met with him and I liked him, and I figured we'll try him, he's a big star, and I thought he would be charming. And he was. Burt could do anything -- he was very talented. He was limited by his action-hero persona. I remember when we made ""Nickelodeon,"" he had a scene with a rifle and the first take was a little macho. I said, ""Can we do it a little less Burt Reynolds?"" He laughed. CNN: When you were making ""At Long Last Love,"" were you worried about the timing was off? The mid-'70s was an era full of dark pictures. Bogdanovich: I guess I didn't give a s***. I had purposely made ""What's Up, Doc?"" as a G-rated comedy, and that was in '72, and they asked me when we were making it are you sure you don't want to make it a PG? I said no, I want to make it for the whole family -- a G-rated comedy with no socially redeeming value. And they all laughed and left me alone, and that was the biggest success of my career. So I thought a musical with a similar light touch would be welcome, but I didn't realize how difficult it is to find the right balance between singing and talking, which is the key to it. And Jim Blakely found it. Putting Hollywood's biggest bombs back together . CNN: Did the reviews sting? Bogdanovich: I didn't read all the nasty reviews. The thing is, before the picture opened, the critic Judith Crist -- she was a friend -- called me up and said, ""How is the picture?"" I said, ""Pretty good, I think."" She said, ""It better be good. They're waiting for you with the knives out."" And she was in the critical establishment -- she knew from which she spoke. We showed them the worst version that existed. (The film) began with Cybill, which was the worst thing to begin with, because they hated her and me particularly. That was the period when you couldn't open a newspaper or magazine without seeing some nasty crack about us. Cary Grant, who was a friend, called me and said, ""Peter, for Chrissakes, stop telling people you're happy, and stop telling them you're in looooove."" ""Why, Cary?"" "" 'Cause they're not happy, and they're not in love."" ""I thought all the world loves a lover?"" ""Naaaa, don't you believe it."" So that was the climate at that point. The picture was killed, except for people such as Roger Ebert, who liked it to a degree, and the Newsweek critic, who liked it to a degree. Woody Allen told me years later that, ""I saw that picture at the (Radio City) Music Hall three or four times. I really liked it."" I said, ""S***, Woody, I wish you'd told me that then."" Nobody was more surprised than I was when I saw it streaming on Netflix and I thought, ""This is good."" You can get too close to a picture. We needed to put it in front of audiences -- it would have taken five or six previews and we would have gotten it right. We only had two previews, which is ridiculous for a musical. CNN: Did you find previews helpful? Bogdanovich: I had very interesting experiences. ""The Last Picture Show"" was at one of those places where the audience was told to turn a knob one way if they like it and another if they don't. And the picture was not liked at all. Columbia turned to me and said, ""What do we do?"" I said, ""I think they need to be told it's a good picture."" And they snapped their fingers and said, ""Tastemaker screenings."" So we had 30 screenings for small groups of people and the buzz was extraordinary. We previewed ""What's Up, Doc?"" in Denver and it was a spectacular success. We previewed ""Paper Moon"" in Denver and it played perfectly. We didn't preview ""Daisy Miller."" And we did preview ""At Long Last Love,"" and you know the results of that. I was told by people I trusted to take things out that really damaged the picture. CNN: What do you think of Hollywood these days? Does the tentpole mentality concern you? Bogdanovich: It's crazy. When Jim Cameron was making ""Titanic,"" everybody was (saying) it's going to be a big flop, Cameron's folly. I said, if that picture's a hit, we're in real trouble. And sure enough, it was a hit. And sure enough (budgets skyrocketed). Spend $150 million! Spend $200 million! And that's where we are today.","Peter Bogdanovich credits Fox employee with saving film .

"(CNN) -- The worst kept secret in Formula One is finally out -- Fernando Alonso is leaving Ferrari and will be replaced by Sebastian Vettel. Red Bull's four-time world champion has signed a three-year contract with the Scuderia, the oldest team in F1, from 2015. After ending his five-year stint at Ferrari, Alonso remains coy on where he will be driving next season. The double move by two of the sport's high profile world champions is the most significant in the driver market this season. But in the fickle world of F1 there are no guarantees it will work out for either of the ambitious racers. There are still seats to be filled at McLaren, Force India and Toro Rosso. With the curtain about to fall on the 2014 season at Sunday's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, hopeful drivers have just one more chance to stake their claim for the remaining seats. Where will Alonso go? Alonso is regarded as the best all-round driver currently racing at the elite level of motorsport, a fact many of his peers are even happily willing to acknowledge. The Spaniard -- a double world champion with Renault in 2005 and 2006 -- is regarded as the key to the F1 driver market. The 33-year-old made it clear he wanted to leave Ferrari, even though he had two years left to run on his contract with the Italian team, but he has yet to confirm where he will go next. A return to McLaren seems most likely, despite his acrimonious departure from the team after just a single season as Lewis Hamilton's teammate in 2007. McLaren is about to embark on a new phase after reigniting its relationship with engine manufacturer Honda. Alonso is expected to lead this new era at McLaren, although the fiercely ambitious driver may first want guarantees that the Honda engine is going to be a success. Keeping the media guessing about his future -- and maybe his future employers too -- seems to have provided Alonso with plenty of sport off track. Speculation in the media has seen Alonso linked with buying the Lotus team, joining forces with German sports car specialists Audi and even ousting Nico Rosberg or Hamilton at Mercedes. Alonso remained typically tight lipped about his future plans when he was questioned by the media at the Abu Dhabi season finale. Has Vettel made the right decision? Vettel has endured his worst season at Red Bull in 2014, failing to win a race compared to three victories for his rookie teammate Daniel Ricciardo. Since his full debut season for Toro Rosso in 2008, the German has won at least one race a year, not to mention winning four straight world championships between 2010 and 2013. The 27-year-old is now hoping to succeed where Alonso failed at Ferrari by adding to his collection of world titles. ""The next stage of my Formula One career will be spent with Ferrari and for me that means the dream of a lifetime has come true,"" Vettel said. ""When I was a kid, Michael Schumacher in the red car was my greatest idol and now it's an incredible honor to finally get the chance to drive a Ferrari. ""I am extremely motivated to help the team get back to the top. I will put my heart and soul into making it happen."" Vettel will partner Kimi Raikkonen -- the last man to win a world title with Ferrari in 2007 -- in 2015 but there are no guarantees the car and its Ferrari engine will be any match for the might of Mercedes. Who will drive for McLaren? McLaren has tried to dampen speculation over just who will be in its cars in 2015 in the build-up to this weekend's season-ending race. ""We know you're awaiting news on our driver line-up. We'll announce after December 1 -- you'll hear it here first,"" the team said on Twitter. Alonso remains the red-hot favorite to take one of the seats but the future of current drivers Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen remains unclear. Button -- the 2009 world champion with Brawn Grand Prix which has since morphed into Mercedes -- has remained sanguine about his future and has even explored the idea of moving to sports car racing. Danish rookie Magnussen is fiercely passionate about staying with McLaren, the team which gave the 22-year-old his F1 debut in 2014. ""There is no Plan B,"" the Dane told CNN when asked if had explored his options if he wasn't retained by the eight-time world champions. Which other teams have seats to fill? Mercedes, Red Bull, Ferrari, Williams, Lotus and Sauber have all confirmed their driver pairings for 2015. There are still seats on offer at McLaren, Force India and Toro Rosso. Force India has already announced it will retain German Nico Hulkenberg for 2015 but Mexican Sergio Perez has not had his position with the team confirmed. There's also only one seat up for grabs at Toro Rosso, who will blood 17-year-old Max Verstappen as the youngest F1 driver in history next season. Junior Red Bull driver Carlos Sainz Jr is in pole position for the second seat -- and the Spaniard has been named as a test driver for Red Bull at the end of season test in Abu Dhabi -- although Toro Rosso may still retain French racer Jean-Eric Vergne. Sauber announced Swede Marcus Ericsson and Brazilian Felipe Nasr as its 2015 drivers in November much to the chagrin of current driver Adrian Sutil, who believed he had a contract with the team for next season. Ericsson and Nasr are both pay drivers, backed by sponsors who bring an estimated $30m funding to the Swiss team. Grid shrinks to 18 in 2015? The F1 market may be flooded with plenty of eager racers but the number of seats has been squeezed. The financial pressures on the Caterham and Marussia teams, which both went into administration in October, means there are, in theory, only 18 spots on the F1 grid in 2015. After missing the U.S. and Brazil grands prix, Caterham has used crowdfunding to help finance a return in Abu Dhabi. Japan's Kamui Kobayashi retained his drive while the team has also handed Briton and former tester Will Stevens his F1 debut. Both Caterham and Marussia remain on the official entry list for the 2015 season but their future is dependent on a hard winter drumming up funding to stay in the sport. With teams spending a minimum of $70m per season, employing a driver who offers pace, performance and a pot of personal talent is more important than ever for those teams for can't afford super-talents like Alonso.","Sebastian Vettel signs a three-year contract with Ferrari from 2015 .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama, over the last two years, has seen his top two former national security Cabinet officials critique his foreign policy decision in Syria. Now the President has gently pushed back. In an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that aired on Sunday, Obama said that arming Syrian rebels in 2012 in their fight against President Bashar al-Assad ""would have been counterproductive."" ""This is in response to the mythology that has evolved that somehow if we had given those folks some guns two and a half years ago, than Syria would be fine,"" Obama said about the 2012 plans. ""For us to just go blind on that would have been counterproductive and would not have helped the situation. It also would have committed us to a much more significant role inside of Syria."" Earlier this month, the President authorized a plan to arm and train rebels in Syria fighting against ISIS, a terrorist group that has swept into power in areas in both Syria and Iraq. Obama's plan also authorizes airstrikes against ISIS targets. Former top Obama administration officials, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, have publicly disagreed with the president on Syria. Clinton wrote in her memoir ""Hard Choices"" that she split with Obama on Syria and urged the president to arm the rebels. In an interview with The Atlantic in August, Clinton said, ""The failure to help build up a credible fighting force of the people who were the originators of the protests against Assad ... the failure to do that left a big vacuum, which the jihadists have now filled."" And just last week, at the annual meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative, the former secretary of state dodged a question on whether arming the rebels was coming too late, given the recent rise of ISIS in Syria. ""Whatever the debates might have been before, this is a threat to the region and beyond,"" Clinton said. ""I can't sit here today and tell you that if we had done what I had recommended we would be in a very different position. I just can't. You can't go and prove a negative."" Clinton does support Obama's plan to arm rebels and launch airstrikes against ISIS in Syria. Panetta echoed Clinton's Syria sentiments and knocked the president in an interview with ""60 Minutes"" earlier this month. ""I think that would've helped,"" the former defense chief said about arming rebels. ""And I think, in part, we pay the price for not doing that in what we see happening with ISIS.""","Obama says arming Syrian rebels in 2012 would have been ""counterproductive""

"(CNN) -- You've been up since 3 a.m. After dealing with long check-in lines, long security lines and long faces from flight attendants even unhappier to be on that plane than you, your 6 a.m. flight finally lifts off. ""I'm just going to recline my seat and catch a couple of hours of sleep before we land,"" you think as the pilot switches off the seatbelt sign. But wait. What's happening? Despite pushing that little round silver button and digging your heels into the floor, your seat refuses to budge. You've just been blocked by the Knee Defender. The 2003 invention of 6'3-tall American Ira Goldman -- ""I was tired of being bumped in the knees by reclining seats"" -- the Knee Defender is a small pair of plastic clips that attach to your lowered seat-back table, locking the chair in front of you in place so the passenger can't recline. Proof of its contentiousness came out this week when United Flight 1462 from Newark to Denver was forced to divert to Chicago's O'Hare airport after a fight broke out between two passengers over one's use of the device. Despite the passengers getting kicked off the plane, the story has led to a boost in sales of the Knee Defender, with the website even crashing under the weight of all that curiosity. Is the Knee Defender even allowed? The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration says it hasn't banned the device as it doesn't have an impact on passenger safety. But most major U.S. airlines, including United, do prohibit its use. It's a similar situation elsewhere. Both Air Canada and Calgary-based WestJet prohibit the Knee Defender, with the latter singling out the device on its website. ""You are not permitted to attach any unapproved device to any part of your seat or any other part of the aircraft,"" says WestJet. ""Some examples of unapproved devices include knee defenders, seat belt extensions and booster seats."" Same story in Australia, where carriers Qantas and Virgin have reportedly banned the device. ""The use of knee defenders or similar device would be in breach of our conditions of carriage (14.2 (b)(f)) which are available on our website,"" a Virgin Australia Airlines spokesperson told CNN. ""The safety and comfort of our guests remains our highest priority."" Singapore Air told CNN the crew would manage the use of the Knee Defender by customers on a case-by-case basis. ""We are reviewing the use of the device, though we have not received any feedback from our customers,"" said an airline spokesperson. In the case of this week's United inflight battle, the flight attendant reportedly told the man to remove the Knee Defender device, but he declined. The female passenger then threw water in his face. The inventor is adamant that buyers should be considerate of other passengers when using the device, which costs $21.95. Users of the device are even advised to print the Knee Defender courtesy card, which explains to the passenger in front of them that their legs are so long their knees will be banged if the flier's seat is reclined. ""If you would like to recline your seat at some point during the flight, please let me know and I will try to adjust myself and my Knee Defender so that it can be done safely."" To recline, or not to recline . The incident has brought to the fore the usual comments on plane etiquette. Some say such devices infringe on passenger rights. Simply put, if an airline allows offers a reclining mechanism -- and some low-cost carriers don't -- then tough luck for the fellow behind you. If he/she doesn't like it, they should cough it up for an upgrade or request a front row seat upon booking, citing their long legs or an injury that requires extra room to stretch out. In the case of United Flight 1462, the pair was seated in the Economy Plus section, which provides passengers up to five inches of extra legroom. Others say passengers need to be respectful of fellow fliers. ""I don't think any of the seats should be able to recline in economy,"" commented David Cleland in our article on the United dust up. ""I have tried to work with someone in front of me reclining and bouncing around. It really is infuriating. I have tried to ask the person in front of me to please not recline...I might have just spit in their coffee by the reaction I received."" Then there's the issue of flight time. Is it really necessary to recline your seat on a two-hour daytime flight? How about a red-eye cross-Atlantic journey? Others -- including Knee Defender inventor Goldman -- blame the airlines for pushing us to the brink by taking away all our space. So how would you react to being told you could only recline your chair a distance designated by the person behind? Should airlines do away with reclining seats altogether? Share your thoughts on the issue in the comments section below.","Knee Defender blocks passengers' ability to recline their seats .

"(CNN) -- A vintage car collection, exotic birds and a gaudy palace; former Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych was seemingly living the high life even as his country's economy stalled. Now, as economic growth goes into reverse, Ukraine is in desperate need of financial help. The question is whether the country's lawmakers will do what they must to persuade the world that there won't be a repeat of Yanukovych's gaudy lifestyle. Last month, anti-corruption protesters in Ukraine surrounded the Kiev parliament building waving gold-painted loaves of bread. The demonstration was aimed at persuading lawmakers to pass strong anti-corruption legislation that would prohibit political leaders like Yanukovych from living gilded lifestyles funded by state coffers. Sadly, lawmakers balked, and the legislation failed by eight votes as too many members of parliament abstained. The vote was a significant setback to President Petro Poroshenko, who had promised to clean up corruption in his presidential campaign. But more importantly, the vote was a blow against efforts to revive Ukraine's economy as the legislation is a prerequisite to securing the next vital tranche of the $17 billion multilateral loan package from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the European Union. The cash is urgently needed if Ukraine is to shore up both its economy and its borders. True, a ceasefire has brought with it a lull in the fighting between government forces and pro-Russian rebels. But clashes have continued even as Russia continues to turn the screws with its own set of sanctions. The problem for Ukraine is that Yanukovych's lifestyle -- allegedly funded through sweetheart deals and shady companies -- has left the international community wary of handing money over to the government without some guarantee that the rule of law will apply to those handling the funds. After all, Ukraine ranked 144th out of 177 countries in the 2013 Transparency International Corruption Perceptions index, with a score that indicated rampant corruption. The failure of last month's vote leaves Poroshenko with two more chances before a parliamentary election later this month to push through the required legislation -- on October 7 and October 14. The laws being tabled are a strong set of regulations that organizations including Transparency International Ukraine have helped draft (and indeed have been advocating for years), including the creation of a dedicated National Anti-Corruption Bureau with investigatory powers to centralize what is now dealt with by an ad hoc group of offices that fail to share information and work together. In addition, the proposals include a time-bound, three-year National Anti-corruption Strategic Plan that sets goals for implementing laws, as well as a law that would make it possible to try those suspected of corruption even if they are not in Ukraine. (The absence of such legislation is thwarting the prosecution and the return of assets allegedly stolen by Yanukovych, who has fled to Russia.) So what is stopping lawmakers getting behind these common sense rules? One sticking point likely scaring politicians is that from the new parliament onward there would be mandatory public registries of lawmakers' assets, so-called asset declarations, and a public list of any potential conflicts of interests. Asset declarations, particularly if they are monitored by civil society, can help raise a red flag if politicians are living beyond their means: a tried and tested tool in the fight against corruption that is particularly effective if you can compare year-on-year wealth accumulation. It's perhaps no wonder, then, that a parliament filled with politicians who profited from Yanukovych's term in office would not be happy with these new laws, and although Poroshenko thought he had amassed the votes to get them passed in September, enough abstained to scupper his plans. But there is still some cause for optimism. With parliamentary elections just three weeks away, many of those former members of Yanukovych's party (the Party of Regions) who have not fled have allied themselves with other parties to keep their seats, and can be expected to try to distance themselves from the corruption that toppled the government. Poroshenko must therefore clearly tie the future economic success of a pro-Western Ukraine to the electoral fortunes of the candidates. If they vote against the legislation this week, international support may wane, the development loans could be delayed and economic recovery stall. Poroshenko must clearly explain this likely chain of events to the public so politicians are convinced that if they are seen as opposing the fight against corruption, they will not attract voters -- voters who have taken to the streets to voice their displeasure over the issue. The map of Ukrainian politics is about to be redrawn. The question is whether lawmakers will seize this opportunity to pass a strong set of anti-corruption laws that will show parliament is committed to ruling the country for the people, not for themselves. The country's future depends on it.","Ukraine's economy in desperate need of help, says Oleksii Khmara .

"(CNN) -- Former Secretary of State Colin Powell announced Sunday that he will be voting for Sen. Barack Obama, citing the Democrat's ""ability to inspire"" and the ""inclusive nature of his campaign."" ""I think he is a transformational figure, he is a new generation coming onto the world stage, onto the American stage, and for that reason I'll be voting for Sen. Barack Obama,"" Powell said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" Powell said he was concerned about what he characterized as a recent negative turn of Republican candidate Sen. John McCain's campaign, such as the campaign's attempts to tie Obama to former 1960s radical Bill Ayers. ""I think that's inappropriate. I understand what politics is about -- I know how you can go after one another, and that's good. But I think this goes too far, and I think it has made the McCain campaign look a little narrow. It's not what the American people are looking for,"" he said. Powell, a retired U.S. general and a Republican, was once seen as a possible presidential candidate himself. Powell said he has some concerns about the direction of the Republican Party, adding that it has ""moved more to the right than I would like to see it."" Read a transcript of Powell's remarks . In regard to the financial crisis, which Powell called the candidates' ""final exam,"" Powell said McCain appeared unsteady in dealing with it, while Obama had excelled in handling the situation. ""Obama displayed a steadiness, an intellectual curiosity, a depth of knowledge,"" Powell said.  Watch what Powell says about Obama » . ""He has met the standard of being a successful president, being an exceptional president,"" he said. Obama praised Powell at a campaign event in Fayetteville, North Carolina, on Sunday, calling him ""a great soldier, a great statesman, and a great American."" ""I have been honored to have the benefit of his wisdom and counsel from time to time over the last few years, but today, I am beyond honored and deeply humbled to have the support of General Colin Powell,"" Obama said. Obama called Powell earlier Sunday and thanked him for his endorsement, communications director Robert Gibbs said. iReport.com: Obama supporters react to endorsement . In their 10-minute conversation, Obama said he looked forward to taking advantage of Powell's advice in the next two weeks and hopefully over the next four years, Gibbs said. During the campaign, Powell has met with both candidates and said he has a lot of respect for McCain. He said Sunday that he thinks both candidates are qualified to be president. ""It isn't easy for me to disappoint Sen. McCain in the way that I have this morning, and I regret that,"" Powell said. Speaking on Fox News Sunday, McCain said he respects and admires Powell, and the announcement ""doesn't come as a surprise."" ""I'm also very pleased to have the endorsement of four former secretaries of state -- Secretaries [Henry] Kissinger, [James] Baker, [Lawrence] Eagleburger, and [Alexander] Haig -- and I'm proud to have the endorsement of well over 200 retired Army generals and admirals,"" McCain said. Powell served as Secretary of State under President Bush from 2001 to 2005. The possibility of a Powell endorsement has been rumored for several months. On August 13, Powell's office denied a report on Fox News by commentator Bill Kristol that Powell had decided to publicly back Obama at the Democratic National Convention. Powell himself brushed off queries on any potential presidential nod but told ABC News in August that he would not be going to Denver, Colorado, for the convention. Back in February, Powell told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that he was weighing an endorsement of a Democratic or independent candidate. Powell has offered praise for Obama, calling him an ""exciting person on the political stage."" ""He has energized a lot of people in America,"" said Powell. ""He has energized a lot of people around the world. And so I think he is worth listening to and seeing what he stands for."" The former general, who has largely steered clear of politics since leaving the Bush administration, noted that the next president will need to work to restore America's standing in the world. Powell gave the keynote address at the Republican National Convention in support of George W. Bush in 2000. Powell said Sunday that he has no plans to campaign for Obama.","NEW: Obama praises Powell at rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina .

"(CNN) -- Investigators turned up human remains at hidden grave sites and arrested dozens of suspects after 43 students disappeared in Iguala, Mexico. Protests surged across the country. The state's governor took a leave of absence. The town's former mayor and police chief appear to be on the lam. But despite the dramatic developments, one haunting constant remains more than a month after the students vanished: They're still missing. On Monday Mexican Attorney General Jesús Murillo Karam said authorities were getting closer to determining the whereabouts of the students, who were mostly young men in their 20s studying to become schoolteachers at a rural college. Federal forces arrested four more people connected with the students' disappearance, he said -- and two of them, both suspected gang members, described dealing with ""a large group of people"" the night the students went missing. ""This brings us much closer to obtaining information ... With this, today we have the first declarations made by those who have confessed and participated on the night of September 26 and in the early morning of the 27th in the disappearance and destination of this large group of people,"" he told reporters. So where are they? At a rally in Mexico's capital Sunday -- the one-month anniversary of the students' disappearance -- one of the country's most well-known writers demanded their return. Elena Poniatowska read descriptions of each of the 43 students, detailing their nicknames, hobbies and hopes. ""Here we ask in the open air, with our voices raised, 'Return them,'"" she told the crowd. The next day, investigators said they'd found a grave inside a landfill in Cocula, Mexico, that could be tied to the case. Authorities have issued arrest warrants for former Iguala Mayor José Luis Abarca; his wife, Maria de los Ángeles Pineda Villa; and the city's former police chief, Felipe Flores Velásquez. Murillo has said they're the suspected ""masterminds"" of events that occurred in Iguala on September 26. At least 57 people have been detained since investigators started searching for the students. But the former mayor and police chief are still at large. On Sunday lawmakers in Mexico's Guerrero state tapped an interim leader after Gov. Angel Aguirre stepped aside amid protests over how he responded to the case of the missing students. Rogelio Ortega, an academic who spoke with CNN en Español last week days before his selection as interim governor, said Guerrero was facing daunting problems that would be difficult to fix. ""The problem today is how to successfully face these unleashed demons,"" he said. ""How can we rebuild the social fabric?""

"(CNN) -- Though Sir David Frost doesn't see his 1977 interviews with former President Richard Nixon as ""an intellectual 'Rocky' "" -- in the words of ""Frost/Nixon"" playwright and screenwriter Peter Morgan -- he does agree that the sessions had their ""adversarial"" moments. David Frost's interviews of Richard Nixon were some of the most watched programs of their time. Particularly, he told CNN, when the topic turned to the Watergate scandal. ""By halfway through the second day [of the interviews], we had got to the point that we had hoped to get to,"" he said. ""And then it was a point of going further and trying to get more than we had really expected."" Nixon famously let down his guard, a moment depicted in in ""Frost/Nixon,"" the new Ron Howard-directed film starring Frank Langella as Nixon and Michael Sheen as Frost. ""I'm saying when the president does it, that means it's not illegal,"" Nixon said during the interview, cementing his ignominy. In some ways, the interviews were an odd topic for an award-winning play (and, now, well-reviewed and Golden Globe-nominated movie). Frost and Nixon mostly sat together talking. There were no punches thrown, no fiery explosions, just conversation -- if occasionally contentious conversation. The sessions in raw form ran more than 28 hours, which was edited down to four 90-minute broadcasts. But in another sense, what happened had as much suspense as a heavyweight title bout, and ""Frost/Nixon"" sets up the interviews by showing two men on undesired paths. Frost, the interviewer, was hoping to rejuvenate a career in decline; Nixon, the ex-president, was hoping to repair his shattered image in the aftermath of Watergate.  Watch Frost talk about the interviews » . Neither figure could have predicted the face-off. Frost was a golden boy in the 1960s, the host of BBC series such as ""That Was the Week That Was"" and ""The Frost Report,"" satirical shows that gave such figures as John Cleese their start. Nixon had mounted an incredible political comeback from his 1960 presidential loss and 1962 California gubernatorial loss to be elected president in 1968 -- and re-elected in a tremendous landslide in 1972. More than 30 years later, Frost remembers Nixon as a surprisingly awkward figure who, upon once discussing what they'd done the previous evening, asked the host, ""Did you do any fornicating?"" ""It was amazing to discover how ... hopeless he was at small talk,"" Frost told CNN. ""I mean, here was this incredible professional politician, a great pro. And he'd never learnt small talk."" But Nixon could also be a charmer, he added. ""For 20 minutes at his house ... my girlfriend and I saw a carefree Nixon,"" he recalled. ""For this 20 minutes, the curtain just lifted,"" and Nixon showed them a guest room where Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev stayed, brought out caviar he'd been sent by the Shah of Iran and asked for a Henry Kissinger impression. ""He was really carefree for 20 minutes, and then, just towards the end ... the screen came across again."" The former president, who died in 1994, has been portrayed as a Shakespearean character -- often along the lines of Iago, King Lear or Richard III, depending on the performer -- in any number of projects, from Robert Altman's 1984 ""Secret Honor,"" which starred Philip Baker Hall as Nixon, to Oliver Stone's 1996 film ""Nixon,"" in which Anthony Hopkins played the lead role. Frost once characterized him as ""a living enigma,"" a term he comes back to. ""He was the most fascinating man,"" he said. ""I mean, an enigma. There's never been anyone who was such an enigma in the Oval Office. ... Someone has to be pretty fascinating, pretty enigmatic, pretty Nixonian to keep one fascinated for 28¾ hours."" The original Frost/Nixon interviews are now available on DVD, and Frost has been pleasantly surprised at the public's interest. ""We've found that people are so interested in this film that they want to see, again, the original DVD of the Watergate [interview], so we've done that,"" he said. ""[The interviews] develop in the way of a whodunit. And you can see the texture change. In the first half ... you can see him saying 'no' to everything and not admitting a thing and then [me] pushing him further."" Of course, ""Frost/Nixon"" is a work of fiction. Many reviewers have made much of a scene in which a drunken Nixon makes a late-night phone call to Frost, an event that never happened. But the real Frost is pleased with how it all came out. ""There is 10 percent of fiction in the film, which no doubt improves the film. But what they got, they got ... absolutely right.""

"(CNN) -- We have no kings or queens, dukes or duchesses, counts or countesses in the United States to build great royal castles as evidence of their power, importance and prestige. Why? The U.S. Constitution specifically bans the government from granting noble titles. (Seriously: It's in Article 1, Section 9.) We don't want any future English King George III coming back to haunt us. That's why there's no U.S. version of Leeds Castle, some 40 miles southeast of London, where six English queens have lived. There's no U.S. replica of Fenton Tower in Scotland, a 16th-century castle that sheltered an on-the-run King James VI of Scotland (who later became King James I of England). However, we do have the rich, who have long built great houses as symbols of their power, wealth and pride. And some hoteliers just like to build castles. Which is why you can still stay in places that will wine and dine you and make you feel like royalty. Here are eight of our favorites. Castle Marne Bed & Breakfast, Denver, Colorado . Castle Marne in Denver's Capitol Hill neighborhood was built as a private residence for real estate developer and investor Wilbur S. Raymond. The house was completed in 1889, and Raymond lived in the house less than a year before losing it to creditors in 1891. After a series of private owners, a stint as a processing center for state parolees and eventual abandonment, new owners restored the structure and opened the once-again elegant Marne as an inn on its centennial birthday. Now restored to its former glory with modern touches, it's a favorite spot for weddings and late afternoon tea. (The tea is included in the room rate, and outside guests can join you for a small charge.) Room rates start at $140 per night based on double occupancy. Norumbega Inn, Camden, Maine . Built in 1886 as a private residence, the Norumbega Inn overlooks Penobscot Bay in Camden. Known as the ""stone castle by the sea,"" it was converted to a bed-and-breakfast in 1984. It was re-infused with life (and a renovation) only last year by new owners, one of whom is a former Culinary Institute of America instructor. (Dinner, say Down Easters, is worth it.) Enjoy the history of this Maine castle, and the rebuilt decks and Wi-Fi that the renovation brought. Low-season room rates start at $159 per night based on double occupancy (starting November 1), and high season rates start at $239 (starting May 22, 2015). Thornewood Castle, Lakewood, Washington . While Thornewood Castle has stood guard over its tiny parcel of Washington state for the past century, its English roots date back more than 500 years. One of the founders of the Port of Tacoma, Chester Thorne bought a 400-year-old English Elizabethan manor in England for his bride, Anna. After it was dismantled, three ships took the manor pieces to northwest Washington, where it was reassembled under the direction of architect Kirtland Kelsey Cutter. A perfect addition is the sunken garden, which was designed over 100 years ago by Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. and John Charles Olmstead. Room rates start at $300 per night (weekdays) and $325 per night (weekends) based on double occupancy. Europe's best affordable castle hotels . Biltmore, Asheville, North Carolina . Known to prefer the country over the city, George Vanderbilt still didn't care for Spartan living. That's why he built the Biltmore. Completed in 1895, the Biltmore was designed by architect Richard Morris Hunt and had 250 rooms, a banquet hall with a 70-foot ceiling, an indoor pool, a bowling alley, a 10,000-volume library, and works of art by Pierre Auguste Renoir and John Singer Sargent. While the 35 bedrooms in the main house aren't for rent, guests can stay at a historic cottage that once served as the gardener's house or an inn built in 2001. The starting rate is $249 per night at the inn based on double occupancy and $1,750 per night at the two-bedroom cottage. The Chanler at Cliff Walk, Newport, Rhode Island . A summertime retreat for New York Rep. John Winthrop Chanler and his wife, Margaret Astor Ward, great granddaughter of the famed businessman Jacob Astor, the Chanler at Cliff Walk was built along Newport's eastern shoreline. Finished in 1873, the house hosted President Theodore Roosevelt, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and other distinguished guests. The house fell into disrepair after serving as a school for girls, Naval officer housing and a museum. The current owners purchased the house in 2000 and spent three years renovating it as a luxury hotel. Room rates start at $305 per night based on double occupancy. Keswick Hall, Keswick, Virginia . Built for Robert B. Crawford and his wife, the Villa Crawford estate was completed in 1912. After his 1919 death, the estate served as a private residence for 35 years. When the Keswick Country Club took over the estate, which originally consisted of an 8,000-square-foot, two-story, stucco-clad Italianate villa, renovations included a pool and tennis courts. English businessman Sir Bernard Ashley -- widower of designer Laura Ashley -- bought the decaying manor in 1990 to convert Keswick into a hotel. Ashley, whose sense of style and business acumen helped turn his wife's work into an international brand, spent $25 million to turn it into a ""country house hotel"" respecting the original structure and design and upgrading the facilities for modern times. Ashley died in 2009, and the hotel is now owned by Historic Hotels of Albemarle. Room rates start at $359 per night based on double occupancy. Castle Hotel & Spa, Tarrytown, New York . Less than an hour's drive north of New York City -- depending on traffic, of course -- Castle Hotel & Spa once served as the Westchester home of Gen. Howard Carroll, a noted businessman and one-time Washington correspondent of The New York Times. Architect Henry Kilburn designed the 45-room ""Carrollcliffe"" in the style of Norman fortifications in the United Kingdom. The success of Carroll's parties inspired him and his wife to expand the original structure to include a new dining room and ballroom. The castle became the headquarters of an investment consulting firm under the next owners. The roof and tower were even used during World War II as an observation post by the town's civil defense to monitor local air traffic. Now you can monitor its lush grounds. Don't forget to book a meal at the hotel restaurant, Equus, which is noted for its use of seasonal, local produce. A 2013 renovation added a THANN Sanctuary Spa. Room rates start at $319 (weekdays) and $455 (weekends) based on double occupancy and include breakfast for two, Wi-Fi, minibar and valet parking. Castle Hill Resort and Spa, Ludlow, Vermont . The home of Allen Miller Fletcher, businessman and governor of Vermont from 1912 to 1915, Castle Hill was the first home in the state to be fully wired for electricity and to boast its own elevator. The English Cotswold-style castle still has original details, including an exterior made of gneiss stone, wallpaper in the staircase that dates back to 1905, and many lighting fixtures and woodwork. Current room rates start at $199 per night on weekdays and $299 on weekends, based on double occupancy.","These U.S. castles are fit for a king or queen .

"Monrovia, Liberia (CNN) -- The general and his soldiers have spent more than a decade at war in Iraq and Afghanistan but this could be one of their toughest battles yet. Their enemy this time is not soldiers or militants. It is Ebola -- invisible and killing thousands in Liberia. Maj. Gen. Darryl Williams, the commander of U.S. Army Africa who is leading the advance team into Liberia, says the mandate here -- straight from President Barack Obama -- is different from other missions. ""We were brought in to provide our unique capabilities and fill the gaps,"" the two-star general says. In other words, Williams and his troops are here in a supporting role and not a leading one. Fight ready . But Williams --who still remembers his college game when he tackled American Football Hall of Famer Dan Marino -- also looks and sounds like he's ready for this fight. As two Osprey military aircraft appear on the horizon, signalling the opening of an air bridge from Senegal that will put more U.S. troops on the ground in Liberia, Williams can't contain his excitement. ""You want to know where the U.S. military is? It's right here,"" the general says, pointing skyward. But tackling Ebola is a tough task and six months after the start of the unprecedented outbreak, critics say the international response continues to be woefully slow. At Liberian government-run Ebola care units, overcrowding has forced patients to sleep on the floors and many healthcare workers who say they've gone weeks since their last pay checks are now threatening to strike. ""There is no question in my mind that we are making an impact,"" the U.S. unit's chief medical officer, Colonel Jim Czarnik says. ""It is about doing it quickly but you don't want to sprint to failure. "" Game changer . Czarnik points to four recently opened Ebola testing labs, run by military personnel that are already making a difference. Thanks to one lab in Bong County, patients now wait hours, not days to get test results. This means patients who test negative spend less time in isolation with those that test positive. ""It's a game changer,"" says Sean Casey, project manager at a care center run by the International Medical Corps charity that sits just minutes down the road from the U.S. Naval laboratory. ""Patients were afraid at one point of coming to an Ebola treatment unit because they were afraid of becoming infected. Now that we have the lab, patients can get the results back within hours."" But there are just four labs in a country where nearly 1,000 cases of Ebola have been confirmed. As Williams inspected the construction of the Monrovia Medical Unit, a facility specifically for infected health workers to be run by U.S. government health teams, a crowd of local residents monitors progress from just across the road. ""While we'll do a lot of tangible things -- we'll build this hospital, we'll build the Ebola treatment units, provide these labs -- there's a lot of intangible nature to this fight,"" he said. You want to give people the resilience, the hope that they can fight this thing and see this through."" His U.S. Army Africa advance team is tiny compared to the 101st Airborne that will be replacing them in the coming weeks. President Obama has authorized up to 4,000 troops to West Africa and since mid-September the few hundred soldiers, sailors and airmen and women in Liberia have been laying the groundwork to make sure that larger force has the housing, medical and logistics in place when they begin to arrive. ""Soldiers are used to moving toward the sounds of the guns. These are the loudest guns that the world has heard in a long time. ""There is no better fight worth fighting then the one in Liberia right now,"" says Czarnik. Complete coverage on Ebola .","U.S. military advance force building facilities to battle Ebola .

"(CNN) -- The last body has been recovered of three U.S. airmen who died when a powerful typhoon struck just off Japan, according to the official website of Kadena Air Base, the U.S. military installation where the men were serving. The name of the airman located Wednesday is not being released pending his family's notification. The three airmen were washed out to sea Sunday as a group of them took photos of big waves on a beach on the island of Okinawa, according to the Japanese Coast Guard. Only one of their names -- Senior Master Sgt. James Swartz -- has been released so far. Surfer goes missing near Tokyo . The seas were churned up by Typhoon Phanfone, which made landfall in central Japan early Monday. It packed sustained winds as strong as 130 kph (81 mph) when it hit land near the city of Hamamatsu, after having moved up the country's southeastern coastline. A 21-year-old university student went missing at lunchtime Sunday while surfing off the coast of Fujisawa, a beach suburb of Tokyo, the coast guard said. Unleashing fierce winds and torrential rain, the typhoon brought widespread disruption to Tokyo and other areas near its path. Thirty-nine people have been injured, authorities said. Hundreds of flights canceled . More than 1.2 million people throughout a wide area of central and eastern Japan were advised to evacuate to shelters, Japanese fire and rescue officials said Monday. More than 7,000 others were ordered to relocate. Air transport was paralyzed, with more than 400 domestic flights canceled, affecting more than 50,000 people. Bullet trains between Tokyo and Osaka, Japan's second biggest city, were also disrupted. Elementary and junior high schools in large areas of central Japan were closed to avoid the heavy rain and strong winds. CNN's Kevin Wang, Yoko Wakatsuki, Jethro Mullen, Josh Levs and Kevin Conlon contributed to this report.","The body of the last of three missing U.S. airmen recovered off Japan, Kadena Air Base said .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. and Arab allies' campaign of airstrikes against al Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria is a necessary step, but airpower on its own won't be enough to ensure a military victory. To beat ISIS and extremist affiliates, the United States and its allies must work more closely with the groups that these terrorists most fear: the Free Syrian Army and Sunni Arab tribes. The effectiveness of the air campaign will hinge on how well the United States can exploit the local vulnerabilities of the asymmetric threat it faces in ISIS. With this in mind, it makes sense to coordinate with Free Syrian Army commanders, who have on-the-ground experience identifying ISIS' weak points and can ensure that airstrikes hit the right targets. Indeed, unless the U.S.-led coalition moves fast to better integrate the Free Syrian Army into military operations, it will simply be hacking at ISIS' branches rather than getting down to its roots. ISIS' concern was evident in a sleek, hourlong documentary the group produced, called ""Flames of War."" After touting a series of victories in Syria and Iraq, ISIS lamented its ""temporary withdrawal"" from large swaths of northern Syria, which was forced by the Free Syrian Army (which ISIS derisively describes as the ""awakening forces""). The setback referred to was the surprise counterattack launched by the Free Syrian Army in January against ISIS positions in three provinces in northern and eastern Syria. At the height of the fighting, ISIS was forced to defend its headquarters in heavy street fighting in the eastern city of Raqqa. The extremists were taken by surprise, and the Free Syrian Army and tribal backers' assault offers a useful primer on how to beat al Qaeda and its offspring. For a start, a joint operations center should be established to serve as a clearinghouse for targeting data and intelligence sharing with Syrian opposition and tribal forces fighting ISIS. Jordanian and United Arab Emirates special forces, both of whom have worked with U.S. special forces in other theaters of war, could be deployed in very limited numbers to provide forward air support to guide pinpoint airstrikes. Meanwhile, American Joint Tactical Air Controllers, who have played a key role in supporting Kurdish security forces in Iraq against ISIS, should be deployed to the border regions so that they can support Free Syrian Army ground operations. In addition, the United States should deploy a special operations team in neighboring Iraq focused on developing a relationship with Sunni Arab anti-ISIS guerrilla forces and tribal leaders that continue to resist ISIS along the Syria-Iraq border. This team could be empowered to establish a special fund (of which Gulf allies can serve as the main contributors) for recruiting and empowering tribal elements in eastern Syria like the Shammar confederation that have already begun to rise up against ISIS. American investment on this front would enable airstrikes to truly tip the balance of the conflict. Finally, the transfer of excess U.S. military equipment to anti-ISIS forces in the field should be accelerated to ensure that the Free Syrian Army and the tribes not only have enough ammunition to sustain a defensive posture against ISIS, but also enough for a multipronged assault into ISIS' core territory. If airstrikes are to have a lasting impact, they must cut off ISIS' land bridge between Syria and Iraq and ultimately decapitate its command structure. Doing so will mean the United States will have to work with, and through, a fast moving and relatively lightly armed counterforce, the groundwork for which may already have been laid with the announcement of U.S. plans to train an initial force of 5,000 Syrian fighters. ISIS appears to be gambling that by concentrating its forces in the relatively exposed terrain of the northern Raqqa steppe that it can overrun positions in the city of Ayn al-Arab and in the northern Aleppo countryside before the airstrikes can have a real impact. But it can also be expected to prioritize the targeting of capable Sunni Arab commanders and tribal leaders who it views as its principal threat, particularly because of their experience engaging ISIS on the ground. The fact is that ISIS has made it abundantly obvious that it sees its Achilles heel in both Iraq and Syria as the local populace. As airstrikes intensify, U.S. and regional military planners should take note.","Oubai Shahbandar and Michael Pregent: To beat ISIS, U.S. must work with groups it fears .

"(CNN) -- Smiling children are using prosthetic hands to open windows through which we can glimpse the future of health care -- a future where outsiders and amateurs innovate along with insiders and professionals. The question is, ""Will America lead the way, as it has for a century, or will it fall behind, as it has begun to do?"" My forthcoming Mercatus Center research ""Fortress and Frontier in American Health Care"" argues that leading requires us to abandon the partisan rancor over health insurance (""Obamacare"" vs. ""repeal and replace"") and focus, instead, on innovating our way to better health. FDA-approved prosthetic hands cost around $40,000. Several years ago, a South African carpenter lost some fingers in an accident and collaborated with a Washington state puppetmaker to invent a vastly more affordable device. They adapted a 19th-century metal-and-whalebone design for a 21st-century 3-D printer to produce a hand that allows users to drive, ride bikes, play ball, grasp objects and feel normal and complete. Printed hands require only a few hours of assembly time, and materials (essentially a special glue, string and screws) cost between $10 and $50 -- 1/1000 the cost of professional models. The proliferation of printed hands began when Jon Schull at the Rochester Institute of Technology formed e-NABLE, a global, Web-based social network, to connect people who need hands with people who are interested in building them. Amateurs quickly began modifying the hands. One added an extra thumb so his son could grasp objects more easily. A student designed a hand that rotates at the wrist just as natural hands can but which $40,000 prosthetics can't. Children designed hands that mimic those of comic-book superheroes-- earning the envy of classmates. Professional prosthetics are much more elaborate, but at $40,000 a pop, they aren't practical for growing children. A fashion designer created stunningly beautiful hands for a fellow student. 3-D Printed hands are evolving at breathtaking speed because of what my Mercatus colleague Adam Thierer calls ""permissionless innovation."" No one has to beg permission from anyone to design, modify or distribute hands. That wouldn't be true if the hands included sensors and/or motors or if they were sold, rather than given away. Regulators would likely swoop in, and innovation would slow. Permissionless innovation is largely alien to health care. New drugs, devices and procedures typically wait for years as regulators sort through stacks of proposals and tons of data. The film ""Dallas Buyers Club"" is based on the true story of an AIDS victim, 30 days from death, who was denied lifesaving treatment because the Food and Drug Administration wanted extra years of testing to assure safety and effectiveness. The greatest example of permissionless innovation is the Internet. In the early 1990s, the federal government surrendered control over the Internet and enabled commercial developers to make full use of the system. Once that happened, professionals and amateurs produced software, hardware and apps in ways and at speeds no one could have foreseen. An American of 25 years ago could scarcely believe our world of Google, Siri, GPS, YouTube, Street View, Facebook, Amazon, Bitcoin and Kindle. None of this would have happened had there been a Federal Internet Commission judging each innovation. If you think, ""but health care is different,"" keep in mind that it would have been equally easy in 1989 to demand heavy regulation of a frightening new communication technology. The Internet raises risks of online fraud, sexual predators, coordinated terrorism, identity theft and privacy violations. If such things as OnStar, GM's safety and connectivity system, or hospital connectivity fails, people can die. Somehow, we decided to accept these risks to enjoy the benefits. Health care may change as much by 2039 as consumer electronics did since 1989. We'll likely see 3-D printed transplantable organs, drugs tailor-made to patients' personal DNA, nanobots to repair damaged genes and artificial intelligence to guide people toward wellness. Excessive regulation, however, can bring these processes to a crawl. Adam Thierer says, ""Trying to preemptively plan for every hypothetical worst-case scenario means the best-case scenarios will never come about."" The innovations will happen in Europe, India, Singapore and elsewhere if not here. And to compete, we have to accept some risks and open the door to some outside innovators. No one suggests completely deregulated health care. The question is one of degree and design. Already, Europe surpasses the United States in drug availability, thanks to its more decentralized approval process. We can suggest an Iron Law of Innovation: For better products at lower cost, you must allow reasonable risk-taking (by consumers and producers), and you must allow unknown outsiders to introduce unexpected genius into the process. The printed hand shows us how. The task is to apply its lessons across health care. Talking about innovation will be a lot more fun and incredibly more productive than squabbling over Obamacare. Rise of 'cyberathletes' could change sport as we know it .","Robert Graboyes: 3-D printers are opening up possibilities for low-cost prosthetics .
FDA-approved prosthetic hands, for example, can cost $40,000. Printed ones, about $50 .

"(CNN) -- Remember in the late '90s when you would kill time in AOL and IRC chatrooms or post on Usenet? You'd strike up conversations with strangers about subjects you were all interested in, say ""The X-Files,"" container gardening or The Fugees. Facebook wants to bring some of that community back with a fun new iOS app called Rooms. The free app, released on Thursday, lets you create or join chatrooms based on shared interests. Start a ""room"" for ""Law & Order"" fan fiction writers, toss up a background photo of Olivia Benson and customize your name or like button with gun or knife emojis. People who join the room can post photos, text and videos. You can share the invite widely or keep the guest list short, though the posts are public. The social media giant is 10 years old. That's solidly middle-age in Internet years, as evidenced by the number of parents and grandparents who have successfully colonized Facebook. To avoid obsolescence, the company has been quick to jump on any new messaging trends that are hip with the kids. It bought Instagram and WhatsApp. It made a Snapchat clone called Poke in 2012, and another called Slingshot earlier this year. Recently, anonymity has been a hot topic embraced by standalone apps such as Whisper and Secret, and cherished by people whose online personas are entirely pseudonymous. Facebook saw first-hand how much people value being able to communicate under their chosen identities. The company started cracking down on members who weren't adhering to its ""real-name"" policy and incurred the wrath of activists and drag queens. Rooms takes the opposite stance. It doesn't require people to use their real names, and encourages chatters to use as many ""nicknames"" as they like for different rooms. In the blog post announcing the app, Facebook's Josh Miller trumpets the key feature. ""In Rooms, you can be 'Wonder Woman' -- or whatever name makes you feel most comfortable and proud. You can even create different identities for different contexts.""","Facebook's latest app Rooms lets people chat about shared interests .

"Monrovia, Liberia (CNN) -- Two children orphaned by Ebola play in the empty corner of a Liberian orphanage. Their parents died last month, and none of the extended family is willing to claim them. They're too afraid. For every Ebola grave, there is roughly one child who lost a parent in the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The disease has robbed at least 4,555 people of their lives. It has robbed some 4,000 children of one or both parents, the U.N. child agency, UNICEF, estimates. The agency fears the number will skyrocket with the rapid increase in Ebola cases. Changing attitudes . The orphans are not sick, and pastor John Ghartey is tired of seeing them not being taken in. He is trying to change attitudes in his congregation at Christ Kingdom Harvest Church in New Georgia, Liberia. It was slow going at first. As Ebola killed parents, the fear of contact with orphaned children spread, even after they persistently showed no symptoms. ""Ebola is separating families because when your family has come down with the virus, nobody want to touch. Nobody want to interact,"" Ghartey said. The disease has indeed turned the social fabric on its head. Extended family usually takes orphans in, but fear has broken the chain, said Manuel Fontaine, UNICEF's regional director. Sometimes, the fear is justified. ""Ebola is turning a basic human reaction like comforting a sick child into a potential death sentence,"" Fontaine said. UNICEF is working on safely treating children who are sick. About 2,500 survivors will get lessons on providing care to children quarantined in treatment centers. Ebola survivors are considered immune to the disease. Inside the world's worst Ebola outbreak . Compassion works . For his part, Ghartey has rallied from the pulpit and set an example, even by just holding orphaned children's hands, a rare gesture in these fearful times. It may have caught on. Some children who were orphaned have found more compassionate relatives. A woman in Ghartey's choir died, leaving her eldest daughter to care for four brothers and sisters in addition to her own 1-year-old daughter. She has taken on the task. The preacher remembers the scene when the woman died. She was lying dead in a room, while the rest of the family lay on the porch. Ghartey invited them into his home. ""They sit in my living room with my family,"" he said. ""They are like a family to us now."" As Ebola has thinned out his flock, the pastor has given them spiritual comfort to fight their fear. ""If Christ is your convener, sickness and diseases cannot destroy you in the name of Jesus!"" In the face of the deadly virus, he preaches, with his whole body and full voice, the hope of an immortal soul. CNN's Nima Elbagir reported and wrote from Monrovia; Ben Brumfield wrote from Atlanta. Faith Karimi contributed to this report.","Relatives won't take in children made orphans by Ebola .

"(CNN) -- You've heard J.J. Cale's songs. ""After Midnight"" was done most famously by Eric Clapton. ""Cocaine,"" too. Lynyrd Skynyrd had a hit with ""Call Me the Breeze,"" Poco did ""Cajun Moon,"" Santana performed ""The Sensitive Kind,"" and Billy Ray Cyrus has done ""Crazy Mama."" And you've heard J.J. Cale's sound. It's a distinctive groove, a smooth-shuffling gait that calls to mind a bluesier Johnny Cash. Clapton emulates it on many of his late-'70s records, such as ""Lay Down Sally"" and ""Promises,"" and it runs like a golden seam through several Dire Straits records -- no surprise, since Mark Knopfler's a fan. But you may not have heard J.J. Cale himself. Oh, he won a Grammy (with Clapton) for his 2006 album, ""The Road to Escondido."" And his new album, ""Roll On"" (Rounder), has earned plenty of praise -- "" 'Roll On' finds Cale back in vintage form,"" said the Boston Globe -- and even a little airplay on satellite and Internet radio. Click on the photo to hear Cale at work . But Cale, 70, has never had a hit, and he's primarily known as a musician's musician. On a recent 2½-week tour, which wraps up April 15, he mainly played 700-seat clubs and theaters, and when it's done, he'll go back home to his house ""on a couple acres in the boonies"" north of San Diego, California, he says. He likes it that way. A new album ""is all mainly dictated by whoever's doing my business end of it. I consider myself semi-retired. Every time I make an album, I go, 'That's the last one,' "" the native Oklahoman said in a voice as rich and peppery as barbecue sauce. ""That's somebody else's idea to make a record and go out and play. I generally don't go out and tour much anymore -- never did, much. I don't really hustle that. ... On a good day, I'm feeling good, I say I'll make another record and go on tour, and on a bad day, I'll say, 'What have I committed myself to?' "" The house, he said, ""is quiet. And I'm a musician. That's what I like about it."" It's a good place for the one-time audio engineer to tinker and compose, though he says he's not conscious of creating the J.J. Cale sound. ""It's all accident,"" he said. ""I never know what I'm doing. Writing songs, you start with a clean piece of paper, so you just start screwing with it. Most of the stuff you write, and sometimes even when you're finished, you go, 'That ain't worth a damn,' but you don't throw it away."" On ""Roll On,"" the groove works in mysterious ways. ""Who Knew,"" the opening track, gains an ominous intensity: ""Who knew / Not me, not you or anyone else / Come to think of it, it's true / We're misinformed and always warned to look out / Who knew,"" he sings, a lonely sax moaning behind his voice. (Listen to ""Who Knew"" in the MP3 box under Cale's photo.) But the groove gives a touch of wistfulness to ""Down to Memphis"" and even a little dance-funk to ""Fonda-Lina."" Cale comes by the variety honestly: He remembers his formative years as soaking in a brew of country, jazz and early rock 'n' roll. ""I'm so old, I can remember before rock 'n' roll come along,"" he recalled. ""When I was a young fellow, I played guitar for other people, so I'd have to learn [cover tunes]. ... So the guitar players on all those early recordings, I guess, influenced what I did. I never could get it exactly right the way they played it, and I guess that helped the style that evolved."" In 1964, Cale and his friend Leon Russell -- along with bassist Carl Radle, later of Derek and the Dominos -- decided to try their luck in Los Angeles. Russell quickly became an in-demand session man, but Cale didn't meet with the same success and soon returned to Oklahoma. But he kept writing and recording, and after Russell signed him to his label, Shelter, ""After Midnight"" found its way to Clapton. The song hit the Top 20 in 1970, and Cale was suddenly in demand. He's put out albums every two or three years since then, but he's just as happy to have others cover his material, particularly Clapton. ""[His] recording all those songs has really helped me pay my rent, 'cause he sells a lot of records,"" he chuckled. After more than 50 years making music, he still seems a little surprised by success, even at his under-the-radar level. ""I was mainly entertaining myself and still am,"" he said. ""Making music is fun if you forget about you're doing it as a commercial thing. And I never did think that. A couple things became commercial, and that came as a surprise."" Which has allowed him to keep playing and keep tinkering. And to keep being J.J. Cale, creating that groove. ""When I approach [a new recording], I always think I'm going to sound different than J.J. Cale, to surprise people,"" he said. ""And when I get through, it just sounds like me, and there's nothing I can do about it.""","J.J. Cale is legend among musicians; wrote ""After Midnight,"" ""Cocaine""

"(CNN) -- Amal Alamuddin may have just accomplished what many believed was the impossible: snagging Hollywood's most notable bachelor. The Lebanese-born British beauty married George Clooney who many thought could never be tied down. Not a lot is known about Alamuddin, who is said to have started dating the actor in October 2013 and became engaged in April 2014. But here is what we do know: . 1. She's a well-respected attorney. Alamuddin's profile on the site The Legal 500 says she ""specialises in international law, human rights, criminal law and extradition."" Some of her clients have included the Royal Court of Bahrain and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. ""She is also part of the legal team representing the government of Cambodia in a case involving a territorial dispute with Thailand at the International Court of Justice in The Hague,"" the site says. ""She has previously worked as a legal adviser to judges at the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and as senior legal adviser to the prosecutor of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon."" 2. Clooney isn't the only one who finds her attractive. She was named one of the 21 hottest female barristers in London on the blog ""Your Barrister Boyfriend."" The blog states: ""Amal Alamuddin may make some feel inadequate because she has achieved the seemingly unattainable ideal of contemporary femininity: She is both breathtakingly beautiful and formidably successful."" 3. She's a world traveler. In addition to being fluent in both Arabic and French, Alamuddin has traveled widely. Her time in the United States included graduating from the New York University School of Law, and among her trips is a safari to Tanzania she reportedly took with Clooney in March. 4. She's discreet. Alamuddin, 36, hasn't been speaking out about her relationship with the 53-year-old star. She has not given extensive interviews and People magazine reported on their wedding based on brief comments from Clooney and guests at the ceremony. 5. Alamuddin must be special. There's no debating this one. Clooney, who was married from 1989 until 1993 to ""No Strings Attached"" actress Talia Balsam, has long been outspoken about the fact that he has had no desire to wed again. In a recent Esquire interview, Clooney said, ""I haven't had aspirations in that way, ever,"" about becoming a husband and father. He has proved that by dating his fair share of women over the years but not settling down. 6. Her co-workers are happy for her. Alamuddin may not be talking, but her law firm has spilled the beans. The Doughty Street law firm was clearly excited about the news and released a statement that read in part: ""The barristers and staff of Doughty Street Chambers offer their best wishes and congratulations to Ms Amal Alamuddin, a member of Chambers, and Mr George Clooney on their engagement to be married.""","Amal Alamuddin has been very private .

"(CNN) -- Twice she has been felled by life-threatening illnesses -- a brain tumor and then cancer -- and twice Criquette Head-Maarek has recovered. For her, the secret to recovering full health is simple -- a love of horses. ""Horses were the cure when I was ill,"" says the veteran trainer, a pioneering female figure in the male-dominated racing world. ""With the brain tumor, the doctor told me life was 50-50, a one-in-two chance,"" she added, reflecting on her first serious illness in 1990. ""For me, that was enough of a chance to come back. It's like a race, you're never beaten until you cross the finishing line."" A month after surgery to remove the brain tumor, she was back working with the horses in her stable -- and did the same again following her cancer scare in 2005. ""They were my drug, my cure,"" says Head-Maarek, whose horse Treve will compete in Sunday's prestigious Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in Paris, where she won by five lengths last year to claim European racing's biggest prize. ""I'm not scared of dying, I've had a fantastic life and don't have any worries. A lot of people have cancer and die young but I'm 66 and have had a fantastic life. If I go, I go. I'm in life to be positive and it's important to be positive for the people around you."" Allied to Head-Maarek's resilience are some impressive genes which suggest she won't be shuffling off This Mortal Coil anytime soon -- her father, the esteemed former trainer Alec, celebrated his 90th birthday in August and is still going strong. The family has been an integral force in French flat racing since William Head, a former English jockey, relocated to France towards the end of the 19th century. Their association with the Prix de l'Arc Triomphe began with his son, another William, who trained Le Paillon to victory two years after the end of the World War Two and again triumphed in 1966 with Bon Mot. In turn, his son Alec was a four-time winning trainer (1952, 1959, 1976 and 1981) while grandson Freddy rode four winners -- the last of which was his sister Criquette's first success in 1979, Three Troikas -- a horse owned by their mother. For Head-Maarek -- christened Christiane but known from an early age as Criquette after her parents took to the name of one of their friends' daughters -- it was a remarkable start to her career as a trainer. It came barely a year after she had been awarded her horse-training license. Growing up, she rode on her pony to the stables each day with her father, telling him of her dream to follow in his footsteps. ""He just said, 'No, it wouldn't happen,' "" she recalls. ""You have to remember I was born in 1948 and there were no women trainers at all. That just did not exist. But from very young, that's all I wanted to be. I worked my whole life for that."" Sent to boarding school in England to learn the language, she was miserable. Rather than study, she spent her time leafing through copies of Sporting Life to check the form and ensure she did not miss a trick in flat racing. A seven-year stint in Madrid from 1967 ensured she is trilingual, able to switch between the three languages as quickly as Treve's turn of pace on the gallops. But she missed France, with the lure of home and horses proving too much. Her first equine job at home was as a bloodstock agent before becoming her father's assistant and then applying for her license in 1978, a female trailblazer along with compatriot Myriam Bollack-Badel, who applied for a license at a similar age and still trains today. Head-Maarek's list of victories since have been impressive -- virtually every race imaginable on French soil, as well as a host of international ones, most notably in England with the 1,000 Guineas (four times), the Coronation Stakes and the Champion Stakes. But the standout wins are the two Prix de l'Arcs, 34 years apart. ""When I won in 1979, I didn't think when will I win it again?"" she says. ""I had horses that ran well some years but it was a case of if I win it, I win it. For me, it was no problem not to win it. It's a hard race, the race that everyone wants to win. ""It's the best race in Europe, actually for me it's the best race in the world. Okay, there's more money with the Dubai World Cup but this has got an aura that no other race possesses. It's something special and, between my family, we've been lucky to have won it a few times."" Head-Maarek finds it impossible to pick her favorite Arc winner, akin to picking a favorite child. She bought Three Troikas in England on behalf of her mother, while Treve -- the filly now owned by Sheik Joann Al Thani, a member of the Qatari royal family -- was bred by her father. ""I have had a few bad years so to then have Treve..."" she says trailing off, almost silenced by the impression arguably the best filly she has ever seen has had on her. Frankie Dettori, Joann's jockey of choice, has been replaced by Thierry Jarnet, who rides Treve regularly and was on board for last year's success. It was a difficult discussion with Dettori, who she calls ""a very nice boy that understood by point of view,"" arguing the blow may have been softened by Treve's relatively lackluster displays of late. ""Treve will go to the Arc whatever,"" says Head-Maarek of the filly's race chances at Longchamp. ""She is not what she was last year because she's had problems with her foot and back. But she's fine, she's getting better. She is a fine champion whatever happens but how will she go? I don't know."" Whether Treve can become the first horse since Alleged, originally ridden by brother Freddy and father Alec, in 1978 to pull off a successful defense is the $5 million question in a race with a purse to match that sum. Head-Maarek insists she is not driven to match the four Arc wins of her father -- ""it's difficult to do what he has done"" -- and she still leans on him for advice as she always done. She still follows his old-school methods of feeding the horses just oats, carrots and artichokes and not using supplements. He, though, was reluctant to let her train, she says because of a fear she might fail, and he protected her in those early years. ""Everyone thought he was just training the horses so, when I made mistakes and they didn't run well, everyone thought it was him,"" she says. ""Although with that he was also credited with the wins. But I didn't mind, I knew what I had done. ""For me, I don't see him so much anymore but I will always listen to him."" Head-Maarek now has the full run of Le Quesnay, the Head base bought by her father and grandfather in 1958. It was a rundown property, left to ruin after the Nazis and their commander for Normandy -- who used it as their base -- were eventually driven out of France. Even today, some of the bunkers remain. ""We couldn't blow those up,"" she says matter-of-factly. Her grandfather was virtually speechless when he first viewed the property, thinking it would ruin the family. But the entire site was rebuilt and has become a horse-racing empire in the intervening five and a half decades. She was 10 when she arrived there, for her it has always been home, a lifetime surrounded by horses, and not once has she ever felt claustrophobic in the equine world. A suggestion that she might ever have been tempted to escape such a life leads to a baffled response. ""Escape?! No, I love it too much and there's still so much to achieve. I want to win the English Derby and every year is different,"" she says referring to Britain's most prestigious race. ""I'm not ready to stop.""","Criquette Head-Maarek remains a key figure in racing despite two serious health scares .

"(CNN) -- Oscar de la Renta was far from just a fashion designer. The man who died Monday at the age of 82 was as much an icon as some of the celebrities he dressed over the years. From haute couture to causal wear, his name became synonymous with glamour and style. After he spent decades making the beautiful all the more so, he became a part of the zeitgeist. The following are five examples of the designer's influence on pop culture. 1. On the small screen . Fans of ""Sex and the City"" often tuned in as much for the style lessons as for the spicy plotlines. Sarah Jessica Parker's Carrie Bradshaw helped put Manolo Blahnik shoes on the map and had viewers trying to emulate some of her looks. Devotees can quote from season six when Bradshaw's artist boyfriend, Aleksandr Petrovsky (Mikhail Baryshnikov), casually mentions his friendship with de la Renta. ""Oscar? You ... you call him Oscar?"" Carrie asks Aleksandr, stunned. He later gifts her with an Oscar de la Renta dress, scoring points with us all. Parker wore one of the designer's gowns at this year's Met Gala. It was literally a signature piece, as she had de la Renta's John Hancock etched on the back. ""I said to Mr. De la Renta, please let me use scarlet embroidery thread and splash your name across the back,"" the actress told Vanity Fair. ""It was my idea. He would never in a million years have done it; he's far too modest."" 2. In the music industry . Hip-hop often finds rappers waxing about luxury. So it's no surprise that more than a few incorporated the designer into their lyrics. Whether it's Nicki Minaj musing about being ""front row at Oscar de la Renta"" or Kanye West's clever word play -- ""especially if she can't get that dress from Oscar de la Renta they wouldn't rent her"" -- many artists used his name to express the good life. Clinton family remembers Oscar de la Renta . 3. With the movers and shakers . His fashions were a favorite of this country's first ladies from Jacqueline Kennedy to Hillary Clinton, and he continued to draw the rich and powerful even in his later years. Celebs like Beyonce and Victoria Beckham were often spotted at his shows, and some, like Oprah Winfrey, clamored to be photographed with the man who dressed them so elegantly. ""So sad for the loss of this legend. Oscar de la Renta thank for all the beauty and inspiration you shared with us,"" ""Project Runway"" judge Nina Garcia tweeted. 4. At the movies . Who can forget the scene in ""The Devil Wears Prada"" in which Meryl Streep as fashion editor Miranda Priestly explains to her assistant Andy Sachs (played by Anne Hathaway) how high fashion filters down to the masses -- including the blue sweater she is wearing. ""You're also blithely unaware of the fact that in 2002, Oscar de la Renta did a collection of cerulean gowns,"" the tough-as-nails Priestly says. ""And then I think it was Yves Saint Laurent, wasn't it, who showed cerulean military jackets? And then cerulean quickly showed up in the collections of eight different designers. Then it filtered down through the department stores and then trickled on down into some tragic Casual Corner where you, no doubt, fished it out of some clearance bin."" 5. Among the people .

"(CNN) -- A Denver Broncos fan who disappeared during a game five days ago simply had ""had his fill of football"" and decided to take a walk to ""somewhere warmer,"" police said Wednesday. Paul Kitterman, 53, was found safe Tuesday night in Pueblo, Colorado, about 110 miles south of Denver's Sports Authority Field at Mile High. Though the Pueblo Police Department released additional details about Kitterman's disappearance, questions will probably persist among his family and friends. One pal told CNN early Tuesday she was sure that ""something bad"" had happened to him. Kitterman was attending his first game with his stepson, Jarod Tonneson, and two friends who sat in another section in the stadium for the Thursday Night Football showdown. The four had ridden from Kremmling, Colorado, together. Despite it being his first experience at a Broncos game -- and the Broncos leading 14-7 at halftime in a matchup with division rivals, the San Diego Chargers -- Kitterman apparently decided to leave the game while Tonneson was in a bathroom. Pueblo police got a report Tuesday that a man fitting Kitterman's description was in a Kmart parking lot. Police found him in good health, and he ""was speaking and answering questions intelligibly that were asked of him,"" according to a police statement. Asked why he vanished, he told an officer that he had ""had his fill of football and decided to go for a walk,"" the statement said. He wanted to walk ""somewhere warmer,"" it said. Kitterman further told police he'd ditched his Broncos hat so no one would recognize him and ""mentioned sleeping in treed areas and in bushes during his journey to Pueblo,"" the statement said. Kitterman said he was tired, so police chaplains arranged a room for him, and police called his family to pick him up. Before Kitterman was found in Pueblo, Tia Bakke, one of the friends with whom he attended the game, told CNN this type of behavior was not customary of him. He was not intoxicated, and he had no mental health issues, she said. ""Paul is the best guy you could ask for. They don't make them like Paul anymore,"" said Bakke, who met Kitterman through her boyfriend, who has known Kitterman for a decade. He'd been known to get away -- to ride his horse or go camping -- but he always told people where he was going, Bakke said. Making matters more complicated was that police couldn't track him via a cell phone or credit cards. He didn't care for either, friends and family said. The family is not releasing any details, according to stepdaughter Tawna Tonneson's Facebook post, which also said that Kitterman was safe and back with his family. ""We thank everyone again for everything y'all did to help us,"" the post said. ""I knew God was walking by our side."" CNN's Ana Cabrera, Justin Lear, Steve Almasy, Jean Casarez and Amanda Watts contributed to this report.","NEW: ""I knew God was walking by our side,"" stepdaughter posts on Facebook .

"(CNN) -- The selfie pandemic -- the cultural Ebola of our networked age -- is going global. It's bad enough that we've had the selfie as the word-of-year, the selfie as a ""brilliant and terrible"" TV show, the smiling selfie at Auschwitz, the selfie with a suicide as its backdrop and the selfie proudly blocking Rembrandt's most masterful self-portrait. But that's just the beginning of this digital disease. Now the selfie has turned its narcissistic gaze upon Islam. The selfie has gone on the Hajj and has turned up at the Kaaba, the cube-shaped black stone building in Mecca that is the holiest place in the Muslim faith. Hajj 2014 is ""the Year of the Selfie"" -- and Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr and Facebook are all abuzz with digital self-portraits of pilgrims who, to fulfill one of the five pillars of faith in the Islamic tradition, have gone to Mecca. ""Epic #selfie #hajj #Mecca,"" wrote @dan_a_lowe on Twitter as he posed, Ellen DeGeneres-Oscar-style, in front of a group of smiling fellow Hajjis. But, of course, not all Muslims are selfie enthusiasts -- even if camera phones are no longer strictly banned at the Kaaba. Although one pilgrim described the selfie craze as an ""endemic not easy to stop,"" some clerics are doing their best to remind Muslims that digital self-portraits in front of the Kaaba are an insult to the Prophet. ""Say no to Haj selfie!"" thus implores the Arab News. ""O Allah, I ask of you a pilgrimage that contains no boasting or showing off,"" adds Jeddah-based scholar Sheikh Assim Al-Hakeem. ""Taking such selfies and videos defy the wish of our Prophet."" ""The hajj is all about overcoming your ""self""! "" reminds @yshirin on Twitter. ""#hajjselfie wont bring anyone anyhere (sic)."" So is anything sacred anymore? Yes. In our networked the age, the sacred -- like everything else -- is being reinvented. What Hajj 2014, ""the Year of the Selfie,"" represents is the democratization of the sacred. In traditional religion, unique places like the black stone Kaaba or the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem represented the sacred. But in our age of digital narcissism, it's the familiar which is made most sacred and we imagine ourselves as the center of the universe. Therein explains the selfie pandemic of placing ourselves in the middle of every photograph. Everything -- or at least everything about us -- is now sacred. The sacred has been turned on its head in a world where tech has allowed narcissism to run riot. In our selfie-culture, we now thinks of the world as revolving around us. So all the hundreds of billions of images we snap -- from Auschwitz to the Kaaba -- comes with a personalized signature. The sacred has been de-mythologized. It now exists in several billion different colors and flavors. So should we expect similar selfie pandemics in the world's other major monotheistic creeds? Unfortunately, that's already happening. Back in August last year, Pope Francis authored the first papal selfie. ""Make the future with beauty, with goodness and truth,"" Pope Francis told some of the kids who posed with him. ""Have courage. Go forward. Make noise."" And ""make noise"" is exactly what we are all doing in our technology-fuelled age of digital narcissism. From Mecca to Rome, we are all making as much noise about ourselves on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook as we can. Traditional monotheistic creeds were all about overcoming ourselves. But our selfie-centric culture is the reverse; today, Muslim pilgrims are turning the Hajj into an epic selfie. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.","The Hajj, one of the five pillars of Islam, is the annual pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia .
Islam requires every Muslim who is physically and financially able to make the journey once .

"Washington (CNN) -- A series of black eyes for the U.S. Secret Service -- including a new report that says supervisors mishandled a 2011 shooting incident at the White House -- should be viewed with the agency's broader mission in mind, a top White House official said on Sunday. Tony Blinken, President Barack Obama's deputy national security adviser, said the new revelation, along with an episode earlier this month that saw an armed intruder gain access inside the executive mansion, were blips for an otherwise stalwart security force. ""Let's put this in perspective,"" Blinken said. ""The men and women of the Secret Service put their lives on the line for the President of the United States, his family, and folks working in the White House every single day, 24 hours a day. Their task is incredible, and the burden that they bear is incredible."" ""I know the Secret Service is on top of this and they will take every necessary step to correct any problems,"" he said. Blinken spoke to CNN's chief political correspondent, Candy Crowley, on ""State of the Union."" Late Saturday, The Washington Post reported that Secret Service officials initially dismissed a series of gunshots that struck the White House in 2011 as backfire from a vehicle near the National Mall, ordering officers on the scene to ""stand down."" When it became clear shots were fired, officials said they came from opposing gang members and were not intended for the White House. The Secret Service tells CNN that it was an uncertain situation. Officers could not ascertain the direction from which shots originated due to probable echoing of the sounds between the buildings around the White House. A Secret Service spokesman said the shots were fired over a quarter mile away from the White House which added to the uncertainty. How Secret Service could beef up White House security . Immediately following the incident, the Secret Service said it notified police and initiated a protective sweep around the outer perimeter of the White House. Officers found no suspect, injured persons or property damage. But damage from the gunshots, which the Post said totaled nearly $100,000, was later found on the Truman Balcony, outside the president's private residence, by a housekeeper. Bullets shattered historic windows but were stopped by a layer of bulletproof glass underneath. While the President and first lady were out of town at the time of the incident, their two daughters and Mrs. Obama's mother were in Washington. Justice Department filings later showed the shooter, Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez of Idaho Falls, Idaho, parked his car south of the White House and fired at least eight shots from an open window toward the White House. He used a Romanian semi-automatic Cugir rifle. He sped away but soon crashed his car, escaping on foot and fleeing aboard a freight train. He was arrested in Pennsylvania five days later. According to the FBI, Ortega-Hernandez alleged the president was the ""anti-Christ"" and claimed he was ""on a mission from God to take out Obama."" The Obamas were outraged at the handling of the 2011 incident, the newspaper reported, and demanded to know why they weren't kept apprised of security details that affected their daughters. Official: Secret Service twice interviewed, released would-be White House intruder . The paper said Michelle Obama spoke to the agency's director at the time, Mark Sullivan, in a voice loud enough to be heard through a closed door. After the 2011 shooting the Secret Service said implemented both personnel and structural enhancements following the review, and other physical and technical enhancements, including additional surveillance cameras. The Post's report came at a trying time for the agency. In mid-September a man armed with a small knife made it over the White House fence and into the North Portico door, the first time in memory an intruder made it inside the executive mansion. He was stopped before making it farther into the President's residence. After that incident, the agency said it was reviewing its officers' response and bolstering security on Pennsylvania Avenue, where the intruder, Omar Gonzalez, jumped over the iron fence. The President, speaking after the September breach, said the agency does ""a great job"" in keeping his family safe.","Washington Post reports Secret Service mishandled response to 2011 shooting incident .

"Washington (CNN) -- Republicans are spending the final weekend of campaigning before Tuesday's election sizing up the possibility of their first Senate majority in nearly a decade, but with key races still too close to call. Latest polls show some critical Senate races tightening, guaranteeing a night of drama and suspense on Tuesday, as Republicans strive for a net gain of six seats to capture the chamber. A GOP victory would give the party complete control on Capitol Hill and the ability to constrain President Barack Obama's final two years in office. But the best the GOP can hope for is a slim majority, which would do little to end the era of gridlock and partisan division that has stifled Washington for years and contributed to an ugly public mood ahead of the election. Even if they win on Tuesday, there is no scenario in which Republicans will gain enough senators to build a 60 seat super-majority that is needed to move major legislation in a deeply partisan Congress. Some races are so tight that turnout will be crucial. In Iowa, a CNN/ORC International poll had Republican Joni Ernst up by two points as she tries to grab a Senate seat held by the retiring Tom Harkin for nearly 30 years. In North Carolina, Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan is clinging to a two-point margin in a state that leans Republican in another CNN survey. In Kentucky, Sen. Mitch McConnell, the man in line to cap a long career on Capitol Hill by becoming Senate majority leader if Republicans win on Tuesday, appears to have opened a small gap over his Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes. The GOP has a solid grip on the House and Republicans are expected to easily win Senate races in South Dakota, Montana and West Virginia. Other battlegrounds are in Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana, New Hampshire, Georgia and Colorado. Top party surrogates and potential 2016 presidential candidates were fanning out in battleground states with three days to go. Hillary Clinton appeared with Grimes in Kentucky, and pleaded with voters not to heed ""fear"" tactics from Republicans she called the ""guardians of gridlock."" ""Don't wake up the day after the election wishing you had done just a little more,"" Clinton told Grimes supporters. On Sunday, Clinton will take her turnout machine to New Hampshire to support Sen. Jeanne Shaheen who is in a surprisingly close tussle with challenger Scott Brown. Her husband, Bill Clinton meanwhile tried to give Democrat Bruce Braley a boost in Iowa on Saturday. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie was headlining a rally in Ohio for Republican Governor John Kasich, who is seeking re-election. Obama, who has been a drag on Democratic candidates, was nevertheless headed to Michigan on Saturday to campaign for Senate candidate Gary Peters and Representative Mark Schauer. Georgia will meanwhile on Sunday hold the final debate before election day of a compelling race between Michelle Nunn and Republican David Perdue, in which Democrats are hopeful of pulling off a shock win. Two Senate races, in Louisiana and Georgia could trigger run-off elections, so it is possible the fate of the chamber will be in limbo for weeks.","Senate races tightening ahead of Tuesday's election .

"(CNN) -- A Philadelphia police detective made a promise to a devastated mother: ""I'm bringing your girl home."" On Wednesday, the promise was kept. Carlesha Freeland-Gaither was found alive, three days after her abduction was captured on a surveillance video in Philadelphia and sparked an all-out manhunt, FBI special agent in charge Ed Hanko told reporters. Freeland-Gaither was found in Jessup, Maryland, southwest of Baltimore, and a suspect was taken into custody, he said. The suspect has been identified as Delven Barnes, 37, Hanko said. Barnes is currently being held on a Virginia warrant for attempted capital murder in another case and ""then he will be charged federally with the crimes here in Philadelphia,"" Hanko said. Authorities credited the public with help in identifying the suspect and his vehicle. ""Tonight we surveilled that vehicle in the area of Jessup, Maryland,"" Hanko said. ""... When the subject exited the vehicle, that's when Ms. (Freeland-Gaither) was recovered."" Freeland-Gaither is in ""good shape"" but has some injuries, he said. She has been taken to a hospital and ""she is talking to the agents,"" according to Hanko. Freeland-Gaither's mother, Keisha Gaither, thanked authorities and the public for helping to locate her daughter. Then she hugged the unidentified detective. ""He brought my baby home,"" she said. The kidnapping is believed to be a ""stranger abduction,"" Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said on CNN's ""AC360"" on Wednesday night. ""That's the way it looks now. Of course, we are in the process of interviewing her now,"" he said. The news Freeland-Gaither was found alive follows reports that someone used her bank card in Maryland a day after she was abducted. A man used Freeland-Gaither's ATM card at 6:01 a.m. Monday at a bank in Aberdeen. Police had earlier said the ATM card was used on Tuesday. Aberdeen is about 75 miles from the Philadelphia street where the 22-year-old woman was forced into a car on Sunday night, Philadelphia police Chief Inspector Dennis Wilson told reporters earlier. Wilson didn't say how the card was used or whether cash was withdrawn. But he said surveillance video showed a man ""similar"" to one who police say dragged and abducted Freeland-Gaither. A second video, also released on Tuesday but recorded about 24 hours earlier, shows a man police say they want to question in connection with the abduction. The time stamp on the video indicates it was also recorded just after 6 a.m. Monday. It shows a man in a dark hooded jacket making purchases at what appears to be a convenience store. No additional information was provided. On Wednesday, police released an additional video of a man, also wearing dark clothing, making a purchase at a convenience store. Police didn't immediately release the bank video. But authorities earlier released a video that they say shows Freeland-Gaither being accosted by an unknown man in Philadelphia's Germantown-Penn Knox area around 9:40 p.m. on Sunday. That video, released Monday, shows a man approaching a woman near an intersection and then grabbing her and dragging her down a street, toward the camera. The released footage doesn't include audio, but a witness reported that Freeland-Gaither yelled for help, police said. The video shows Freeland-Gaither tussling on the ground with her abductor and being forced into a four-door vehicle, which police say may be a gray Ford Taurus. Her glasses and cell phone were dropped onto the road during the struggle. Just before the vehicle pulled away, she broke out one of the passenger side windows, police said. Freeland-Gaither's family told CNN affiliate WPVI that she worked as a nurse and was just blocks from her home when she was abducted. Investigators aren't sure whether she knew her abductor, though there's no indication on the Philadelphia surveillance video that she did, Wilson said. Police haven't publicly talked about a possible motive. CNN's Ed Payne, Jason Hanna, Ray Sanchez and Dana Ford contributed to this report.","NEW: Appears to be a ""stranger abduction,"" police official says .

"Providence, Rhode Island (CNN) -- Tuesday's election in the littlest of states is causing the biggest of stirs. When President Barack Obama hits the campaign trail here Friday to lend his star power to Jorge Elorza, the first-time candidate running in the city's deadlocked mayoral race, he won't be the most famous politician in the Ocean State that day. That distinction belongs to the politician running against Elorza, the larger than life man who's never lost a political race, the man who served as Providence's mayor twice before -- and who was forced to resign each time in disgrace: Buddy Cianci. ""You're not going to get a Pulitzer Prize or an Emmy by saying 'Buddy Cianci is a convicted felon.' Cianci told CNN at his Providence headquarters this week. ""Everybody knows that."" He added: ""I'm probably the most vetted candidate in America right now. They know everything about me."" Cianci, a back-slapping machine politician reminiscent of a bygone era, served as the city's mayor from 1975 to 1984 and then again from 1991 to 2002, epochs recalled locally as Buddy I and Buddy II. Buddy I came crashing down after Cianci was convicted of using a fire log and a lit cigarette to assault a man he accused of having an affair with his wife. Buddy II ended after Cianci was convicted on federal corruption charges. At the end of his 2002 trial, the judge rebuked Cianci before sentencing him to federal prison for five years. ""In this mayor's two administrations, there has been more corruption in the city of Providence than in the history of this state,"" said Judge Ernest Torres. Cianci isn't shying away from his past. ""I've made mistakes in my life obviously, I've paid the price,"" he told CNN. ""We all stumble, I stumbled. That doesn't prevent me from running for office...I've done my time, and I think I'm a contributing member to this society and this city."" While Cianci's stumbles didn't prevent him from running for office, his 37-year-old opponent hopes that they'll prevent him from capturing it. ""We have a storied history of corruption here in our city,"" Elorza said at a recent press conference. ""And those incidents of corruption are very well-documented in Mr. Cianci's administration."" Three former U.S. attorneys -- among them current U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse -- doubled down on those sentiments, urging voters to reject Cianci at a press conference they convened October 14. ""I would very much doubt that the return of this particular shadow would do our applications any good,"" said Whitehouse, referring to federal grant applications. But for Buddy, it's a familiar refrain. In fact, it's Cianci's past -- warts and all -- that lay at the heart of the campaign message driving the 73-year-old's ""final rodeo"" -- the quest for a Buddy III. ""They can talk all they want about me and my background,"" he said. ""The question is: if you went into a hospital and you had to have open heart surgery, would you want the intern to do it or would you want the experienced doctor even though the doctor might have had a couple of problems in his life? Everyone in Providence it seems has an opinion about Cianci, and they typically fall into one of three categories. There are those that love him, such as Sandra Perrone. ""I think of him as a Robin Hood."" she told CNN. ""I just think he should be given another chance."" There are those that don't. ""Buddy Cianci is someone who's very flashy,"" said Joshua Shockly. ""I think it's all show with him, there's not any substance behind what he does."" Then there are the conflicted. Cianci ""is someone who is incredibly charming, actually very intelligent, very funny, (and) very glib,"" said Kent Mallard. ""But somebody who I would never vote for for mayor."" ""I think Buddy Cianci loves this city and that he did some good things for this city,"" added Shockly. ""I just don't think this city needs somebody like him at this point in time where Providence and Rhode Island in general needs to take a step forward out of a past which has really kept us kind of behind everyone else."" That even Cianci's detractors concede that there is much to like and admire about the man reveals the underlying conflict facing voters in the city of nearly 180,000 as they head to the polls on Tuesday: Do they go with the candidate with a shadowy past but who nevertheless worked tirelessly to bring a once blighted, ne'er do well city out from those very shadows? Or do they go with the less experienced and younger Elorza, a candidate who Obama -- a politician who knows a little something about being young and inexperienced and running for office -- says will ""will bring honest leadership to Providence?"" ""A lot of positive things happened while (Buddy) was in office but a lot of negative things happened,"" said resident Dennis Emsley. ""I mean, he's a celebrity, he has a certain cache, but there are other candidates that are more connected to what's going on in the city today and that are going to be more able to lead the city into the future and I don't think that'd be Buddy Cianci."" As for any other celebrity -- presidential or otherwise -- campaigning against a Buddy III, Cianci says his opponent can have them. ""You know what they all have in common? None of them live in the city of Providence.""","Buddy Cianci is running for mayor of Providence for the third time .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- When Melora Rivera heard an intruder kicking the front door of her Venice, California, home Wednesday morning, her reaction was to jump out of bed and onto her roof. ""Once I saw him in the house, I knew that we both couldn't be there,"" Rivera told CNN TV affiliate KCAL/KCBS. ""I knew that I didn't want to have a confrontation with him of any sort, you know, not knowing what his intention was."" Rivera, dressed only in a flannel shirt, used her cell phone to call police as the intruder also climbed onto the roof. ""The drop is, I would guess, more than 20 feet,"" Rivera said. ""So there was no safely jumping off the roof or coming down from the roof at that point."" Police arrived in about two minutes, but they only saw Rivera on the roof, Los Angeles Police spokeswoman Sara Faden said. Officers initially weren't sure she wasn't the intruder they were called to stop. ""It was my biggest fear was that he was going to be forced by the cops to come hide in basically the same place I was hiding,"" Rivera said. Sandra Bullock came face-to-face with stalker in her home . Home intrusions happen every day and everywhere, but this incident is unusual because several of Rivera's neighbors watching the drama used their cell phones to capture photos and video of the unfolding drama. One especially striking image shows Rivera huddled under an eave with her phone to her ear while the intruder lurks just above. Other photos show police with guns drawn, ready to protect the woman if the intruder attacks. Rivera was finally rescued from the roof with a Los Angeles Fire Department ladder. Police eventually coaxed the intruder down, placing him in handcuffs and charging him with burglary. Officer Faden identified him as Christian Hicks, 29.

"(CNN) -- Syreeta Myers knows what it is to lose her only child. ""It's the worst pain ever."" ""My life is empty now. My heart is empty."" More than half a dozen bullets struck Vonderrit Deondre Myers, 18, in an encounter with an off-duty police officer. All but one of the shots were nonlethal, striking his lower extremities. The lethal shot hit him in the head. Myers' mother, Syreeta, doesn't believe her son did anything wrong and blames police. ""They took him away from me,"" she told CNN's Jason Carroll on Friday. ""He was just getting something to eat."" But police said Myers shot first, firing three times at the man in a police uniform, who was working on a private security patrol in a neighborhood. The officer returned fire with 17 rounds. It started when Myers and two other males ran from the officer, who was in a car, St. Louis police said. The off-duty officer pursued them because he thought one of them had a handgun. He tussled with Myers, who pulled a weapon, police said. After the exchange of fire, Myers was pronounced dead on the scene. A 9 mm weapon was recovered -- the gun Myers fired with, police said. It was jammed, they said, no longer readily able to fire. The gun had been reported stolen in late September. Investigators recovered bullets that had flown in the officer's direction. One was lodged in a car, police said Friday. iReport video: Shots fired at St. Louis protest . Protesters invoke Michael Brown . Protesters took to St. Louis streets for two nights this week, and some of them drew parallels to the shooting of Michael Brown in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson. Myers and Brown were both 18, African-American and killed by white police officers. One big difference: Police said Brown was unarmed. Chants of ""no justice, no peace"" rang into the night as crowds rallied after the Wednesday evening shooting. One officer suffered minor injuries and two police cruisers were damaged, Jackson said. A handful of arrests were made. Protesters also burned at least one American flag, CNN affiliate KSDK reported. ""It's a clear case of this young man being gunned down by an insensitive white officer who was off-duty,"" Akbar Muhammad, who also is a member of a coalition calling for the officer who shot Brown to be prosecuted, told CNN affiliate KTVI. Police lawyer: Force not excessive . Neil Bruntrager, a lawyer for the St. Louis Police Officers' Association, dismissed accusations that 17 shots were excessive. ""When he uses deadly force, he uses deadly force until the threat is gone,"" he said on ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" Without video of the incident or unbiased witnesses, the police and the public must rely on physical evidence, he said. Van Jones, a civil rights activist and CNN contributor, said there is a lot of police mistrust after the Brown killing. ""You're seeing a wholesale breakdown of trust,"" he said. The officer, a six-year veteran who has not been named, was placed on administrative leave, per standard department procedure. He served two tours of duty with the military in Iraq and was awarded a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart, Bruntrager said.

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of small earthquakes have rumbled under northwestern Nevada like a seismic drumroll since midsummer, and in recent days, they have built to a crescendo. This does not necessarily mean a big one will come, state seismologists said, but they added that it's good to be prepared, just in case. Seismologists refer to such quake groupings as swarms, and the U.S. Geological Survey has detected them regularly. They can produce thousands of small tremors. In September, for example, about 500 miniquakes struck southeastern California in about two days. The largest topped out at a magnitude 3.8 -- a strength that could be felt but was not dangerous. For months . But the Nevada swarm buzzing in and around the Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge has gone on since July 12. In recent days -- since October 30 -- they have grown stronger, with three over magnitude 4.0. The strongest one weighed in Tuesday at magnitude 4.6 -- approaching the threshold of a lightly damaging quake. ""There is a slightly elevated risk of a larger earthquake while the swarm is active,"" said seismologist Ian Madin from neighboring Oregon. This swarm looks much like two previous swarms that produced somewhat strong earthquakes, the Nevada Seismological Laboratory says. Similar swarms . In 1968, in nearby Adel, Oregon, a swarm lasting several months produced three quakes of about magnitude 5. ""The Adel swarm caused moderate damage,"" the NSL said. Another, shorter swarm near Reno, Nevada, in 2008 led to a magnitude 5 quake and caused moderate local damage. The vast majority of the current Nevada swarm's quakes have been undetectable to people walking around on top of them. Since they started four months ago, Nevada Seismological Laboratory has recorded around 550 quakes of magnitude 2 or higher, and 42 with intensities above 3.0. The center of the activity is in a sparsely populated area, the USGS says. There are two towns about 40 miles away, each with a population of about 2,500. How earthquakes are measured .","Hundreds of mainly low-magnitude quakes have been recorded .

"(CNN) -- Is the world spinning out of control? I get asked this question a lot these days, and for understandable reasons. Look at what's been in the news in just the last few weeks. The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria's execution videos, Scotland's bid for secession, Russian soldiers in Ukraine. There is an unraveling taking place in parts of the world. In the Middle East, the old order that stretched from Libya to Syria has collapsed. In Russia, the rise of oil prices has empowered and emboldened President Vladimir Putin -- and he wants a makeover on the fall of the Soviet Union. Putin is testing the stability of the old international order built after World War II, and sees that it is weaker than most people might have guessed. But why is all this happening? In the Middle East, people were tired of the old dictatorships. They weren't prepared for what should follow them, but they wanted greater space and voice. The result has been chaos and violence, but perhaps that is the brutal, ugly phase that will force people there to find a way to make their peace with the modern world. After all, Europe went through its own religious wars, wars or nationalism, and world wars before it became the stable continent it is today. Similarly, in Eurasia, the real driver of what has happened there is not the West or Russia, but the Ukrainian people. They decided that they didn't want to be vassals of the Kremlin. They look with longing at Poland, which in 1989 had a similar-sized economy to theirs and is now twice the size, and is a member in good standing of the European Union. Of course there are Ukrainians who feel differently -- that's what's causing the turmoil -- but most, overwhelmingly, want to chart a future with the West. Whether they can remains an open question, given Putin's firm resolve to sabotage their plans. But again, this is a sign of people searching for greater connections with the civilized world. And look at the rest of the world. India and Indonesia have elected leaders who are friendly towards markets, the West, and America -- resolutely democratic and yet strong nationalists. Mexico and Colombia have reformers at the helm. In Africa, there are many governments from Ethiopia to Rwanda, where you see real progress in health and living conditions. There are many pieces of bad news coming out of that continent -- from Ebola to Boko Haram -- but there is also good news, growing economies, a surging middle class. And look at the world's two largest economies. The United States remains economically vibrant, with a dynamic society, new technologies that dominate the world, and new sources of energy that will power it for a few generations. China, for all the noise, remains committed to economic development first, is embarking on anti-corruption and reform drives and has even begun to tackle pollution and climate change as an issue. I'm not saying that all is well in the world -- I'm really suggesting that we are in the midst of great global change. Much of this change is driven by good news -- people's desires for greater freedom and autonomy, new information technologies, etc. But all change is disruptive, and without the institutions of freedom and the civic culture of liberty, this period of transition can be dangerous. The forces of integration will not automatically triumph over the forces of disintegration. But there are many good forces out here that are also sweeping through the world these days. And, of course, Scotland did not end up seceding. Score one for integration.","There is an unraveling taking place in parts of the world, writes Fareed Zakaria .

"(CNN) -- Former top-10 player Marin Cilic had his doping ban reduced to four months Friday, leaving the Croatian with a sense of ""justice"" but the head of tennis' world governing body seeking answers. Cilic will be allowed to compete at next week's Paris Masters after his suspension was cut from nine months by the Switzerland-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which has final say on the case. He has already served the four months. Cilic appealed to CAS as he wanted his penalty wiped out completely while the International Tennis Federation (ITF) sought a longer suspension than the one handed out by its independent tribunal. ""I can't even describe how happy Marin was when he found out the news,"" Cilic's manager Vincent Stavaux told CNN. ""He was without words. ""The first word that was coming out of the team's mouth was 'justice' because this case was empty. ""We are disappointed with the way the ITF treated his case. They had the feeling they caught a big fish because it was a (highly ranked) player."" ITF president Francesco Ricci Bitti said his organization is awaiting more details about the verdict. ""The ITF respects the decision of the CAS tribunal, who agreed that an anti-doping rule violation has been committed,"" Ricci Bitti said in a statement sent to CNN. ""We await the full decision to better understand CAS's reasoning for reducing the sanction."" In September the independent tribunal could have banned Cilic for two years but it deemed the 25-year-old didn't intend to boost his performance. The ITF said at the time that a urine sample submitted in May during the BMW Open in Munich contained the prohibited stimulant nikethamide. Cilic and his team contended, though, that no nikethamide was in the sample. It added that Cilic was sanctioned on a strict reading of the rules. CAS appeared to agree, calling the original punishment ""too severe."" The three-person panel ""determined that the degree of fault committed by the athlete was inferior to that established"" in the original decision, CAS said on its website. ""The panel also determined that the sanction imposed was too severe in view of the degree of fault and concluded that it should be reduced to four months."" Stavaux also took exception to the ITF's anti-doping tribunal claiming in September that Cilic withdrew from a match at Wimbledon in June to ""avoid adverse publicity"" after he tested positive. The player, however, cited a knee injury. ""He had surgery two days after he pulled out,"" according to Stavaux. ""The ITF put a lot of pressure on our lawyers (to make Cilic pull out)."" Cilic is in the field at the Paris Masters and tournament director Guy Forget had no issue with the former Australian semifinalist competing at the final regular season event on the men's tour. His ranking has fallen from 12th to 47th during his time away from the game, and he cannot qualify for the ATP World Tour Finals in London next month. ""He was still on the (entry) list and can play if he wants to and if he's allowed to,"" Forget told CNN. Cilic, due to speak to reporters in Paris this weekend, has practiced regularly and is ""really hungry"" to return, Stavaux said. CAS could rule on another tennis case soon. Serbia's Viktor Troicki is appealing his 18-month ban for failing to provide a blood test at the Monte Carlo Masters in April and CAS heard his case on October 9.","Marin Cilic is free to play in next week's Paris Masters after his drug suspension was reduced .

"Washington (CNN) -- David Nieland, who helped draw attention to what he said were shortcomings in the government's probe of a Secret Service prostitution scandal, resigned from his job at the Department of Homeland Security inspector general on Aug. 9, months after he was caught up police prostitution sting. Deputies in Broward county, Florida, conducting an anti-prostitution operation on May 2 stopped Nieland after he was seen entering and leaving a location they were monitoring for prostitution activity, according to U.S. government sources. Nieland was an investigator with the DHS inspector general, who claimed that political interference appeared to cause the inspector general to hold back findings in an investigation of Secret Service agents involved with prostitutes in Cartagena, Colombia. The Office of Inspector General confirmed that Nieland ""separated"" from federal service in August, but added ""As a matter of policy, the OIG does not comment on investigative or personnel matters."" U.S. government sources said Nieland, wearing casual clothing including khakis, told deputies who stopped him he was there as a law enforcement officer working on an anti-human trafficking operation. His story prompted the deputies to stop their operation, for fear of conflicting with a federal probe, according to those U.S. government sources. Nieland told his bosses that he had been stopped because of a broken taillight, but his superiors found out from local authorities that he was caught in the local prostitution operation. CNN attempted to reach Nieland in recent weeks without success. He told the New York Times the story wasn't true.

"(CNN) -- Managing Ebola demands as much of our diligence in infection control practice as SARS did. And though Ebola may, in theory, be less contagious than the airborne SARS or Middle East respiratory syndrome viruses, it is spread through direct contact with infected body fluids or organs and has been demonstrably and tragically more fatal. The SARS experience in Canada, though harrowing at the time, has helped us better prepare. In 2003, 224 people in Toronto were diagnosed with SARS, and 38 people died. SARS, which stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome, had originated in China and became a worldwide epidemic. No longer are highly infectious diseases a world away. We have become more sensitive about just how global any infectious disease can be, and that it's easy enough to ""import"" a disease. SARS also reminded us that many infections may be spread and acquired by patients, visitors and staff in health care settings. After SARS, that sensitivity translated into planning and implementation for the eventuality that a patient with another infectious disease may present at our door. We are ready with protocols in place, in particular for adequate screening with the travel history of new patients, providing health care providers with personal protective equipment and ongoing training in its appropriate use, and ensuring rigorous environmental cleaning practices for all patient care areas. We regularly engage our health care providers on the critical importance of knowing how to appropriately put on and remove personal protective equipment. We have the advantage of learning from experiences in West Africa. Many of the centers that have been set up for dealing with Ebola patients there now use a buddy system to help ensure that everyone puts on and takes off personal protective equipment in the safest way possible, and we are going to be implementing that policy here. The SARS experience also increased our emphasis on proper hand hygiene. One cannot just rely on the barriers like personal protective equipment. We need to also rely on the important and fundamental practice of cleaning one's hands. Proper hand hygiene includes washing with soap and water, or use of an alcohol-based hand wash rub, before and after each patient contact. We and other facilities across the country conduct regular audits for hand hygiene compliance. Planning and implementation require resources and expertise, and there is no question that after SARS, nationally and federally, our government acknowledged and addressed the need to strengthen our public health services. Hospitals were given additional resources to ensure they had appropriate infection prevention and control infrastructure, including adequate isolation facilities across the country. Hospital accreditation standards and guidelines were also substantially bolstered to ensure adequate attention to infection prevention and control. More policies were developed to address these kinds of wide-impact infectious diseases scenarios. SARS also taught us the importance of communication, consistent messages, and accountability for dealing with these types of wide-impact events, and of making everyone aware -- both internally to patients and staff, and externally to the community served by the hospital -- of the situation and what measures were being implemented. Today, our lines of communication are much more open. We began a planning process months ago in collaboration with public health agencies for the eventuality that an Ebola patient may present at our hospital. It is not an eventuality we look forward to, but given the lessons we have learned, we are better informed and prepared.","SARS killed 38 people in Toronto; Dr. Andrew Simor says there were lessons learned .
He says staff learned to screen patients and to suit up with protective equipment .

"(CNN) -- At a women's leadership event, Vice President Joe Biden on Friday briefly praised a senator notoriously known for resigning amid sexual harassment allegations. Biden, a former senator who authored the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, was listing women's issues at the center of congressional fights between Republicans and Democrats. As he often does, Biden said he missed the old guard in the GOP, some of whom he said were strong backers of now Democratic priorities like raising the minimum wage and equal pay. Biden says use of term 'Shylocks' was a poor choice . This time, he singled out former Sens. Bob Packwood of Oregon and Charles ""Mac"" Mathias of Maryland as examples. ""It was Republicans that were involved,"" Biden said at the event, hosted by the Democratic National Committee. ""Guys like Mac Mathias and Packwood and so many others. It wasn't Democrats alone. Republicans were the sponsors of the raises of the minimum wage. I could go on and on. I'm not joking: This is not your father's Republican Party, or your mother's Republican Party."" Packwood, a senator for 26 years, was known for his pro-choice stance and had support from feminist groups, including Planned Parenthood. Joe Biden goes to Iowa with a bunch of nuns . But in 1995, the Senate Ethics Committee recommended that he be expelled from Congress because of sexual and official misconduct. Ten women had accused him of sexual harassment. At the urging of even his closest colleagues, Packwood resigned. A source close to Biden, who asked not to be named, said, ""Throughout his entire career, the vice president has been a leading voice in the fight to stop violence against women."" His speech came just days after Biden, who hasn't ruled out a presidential bid in 2016, said he regretted using what's considered an anti-Semitic term in a separate speech.

"(CNN) -- The Hindu holiday of Diwali is India's biggest and brightest national holiday. But Indians around the world come together to celebrate the festival of lights. The five-day celebration of good over evil is as important to Hindus as Christmas is to Christians, and it marks the start of a new financial year for Indian businesses worldwide. But how much do you know about this global holiday, which began Thursday? Here are some facts and stats to help you improve your Diwali literacy. 1. Diwali or Deepavali means rows of lights or lamps . Diwali is known as the festival of lights because of the oil lamps and electric lights that people use to decorate homes, businesses and public spaces. As a celebration of the victory of good over evil and light over darkness, light is an important physical and spiritual symbol of the holiday. 2. The name for a Hindu place of worship is ""mandir"" Christianity has churches, Judaism has synagogues, Islam has mosques and Hinduism has mandirs. On Diwali, Indians living abroad gather in mandirs for community celebrations. People leave offerings of food at the altars of different gods and gather for communal meals. Some mandirs host fireworks displays. 3. Followers of various religions observe customs related to Diwali . For many Indians, Diwali honors Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth. They light their homes and open their doors and windows to welcome her. In addition to Hindus, Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs also celebrate Diwali in such countries as Nepal, Bangladesh, Malaysia and Singapore. Legends and customs accompanying Diwali celebrations vary among religions and regions. 4. People spend a lot of time getting ready . Families spend days cleaning and decorate their homes in preparation for Diwali. They also shop for new clothes and outfits to wear to celebrations. Unsurprisingly, there are a lot of ways to go about this, from arts and crafts to makeup tricks to help you ""shimmer, shine and sparkle."" 5. Diwali is a big celebration in England, too . This year, about 30,000 people attended a ""switch-on"" of more than 6,000 lamps in Leicester to mark the start of Diwali. Indians are the second-largest minority in Britain, according to IBT. 6. An episode of ""The Office"" was dedicated to Diwali . In one of few depictions of the holiday in American pop culture, bumbling Dunder Mifflin boss Michael Scott encourages his staff to support Kelly Kapoor by attending a local Diwali celebration. Cringe-worthy moments ensue.","Diwali, also known as the festival of lights, began Thursday .

"(CNN) -- It's no coincidence that Ai Weiwei's latest exhibition is located in Alcatraz, a former jail that sits on an isolated island off the San Francisco coast. The Chinese artist and activist explores themes of imprisonment, featuring prisoners of conscience from around the world. It's also familiar territory for Ai, who was detained by Chinese authorities for 81 days in 2011 and still cannot travel out of China. Visitors to Ai's exhibit, called @Large, can sit in a drab, 8x5 feet concrete cell and listen to the works of dissidents, such as anti-Apartheid singers and anti-Soviet musicians whose poems or songs landed them in prison. Among them is Lolo, a Tibetan singer whose song implores the children of Tibet to ""raise the Tibetan flag."" Lolo is serving a six-year prison sentence for calling for independence -- a direct challenge to China's rule. In another installation, the image of Liu Xiaobo, the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize winner, fashioned out of black, grey, blue and white Lego peers out at visitors. Liu, who called for the end of China's single-party rule, is serving an 11-year prison sentence. Tiananmen and 'June Fourth' in the body of Liu Xiaobo . The theme of confinement and suppression runs throughout the former U.S. federal penitentiary. Although Alcatraz is better known for holding feared inmates like U.S. gangster Al Capone, the prison also held Native Americans who balked at mandatory U.S. assimilation policies and conscientious objectors, who refused to serve in the military on political or religious grounds. Photos: A Chinese dragon in Alcatraz . Ai doesn't back off critiquing the United States, by crediting Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning among the 176 people around the world who have been imprisoned or exiled because of their beliefs or affiliations. He pays tribute to them by forming their faces out of 1.2 million Lego pieces. Contemporary artistic dissent . Through his art, Ai declares: ""Every one of us is a potential convict."" When Ai's exhibit on Alcatraz officially opened in late September, it coincided with mass pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. During that weekend, police in Hong Kong arrested about 70 student protesters, including several of its young leaders, in the mass call for democracy. That protest, fueled by youngsters, is now continuing into its fourth week in Hong Kong. It's important that the work can appeal to the next generation, says Cheryl Haines, the curator of the @Large exhibit. Some of the artworks are interactive, encouraging viewers to walk, view more closely or even get involved -- especially in one installation where they can write postcards to imprisoned dissidents. ""It invigorates the viewers to interact with the work,"" said Haines, the executive director of FOR-SITE, a foundation which organized the exhibit. They also brought wifi to Alcatraz for the first time so visitors could send Instagrams and Tweets from the island. ""It's keeping with the artist's desire to activate the next generation's conversation,"" Haines said. In a sense, it already has. Protest art has proliferated on the streets of Hong Kong, whether it's calling for democracy or lampooning its chief executive through postcards, paintings and pop-up installations. Symbols of democracy and free speech plaster the walls, highway barriers, bridges and stairways. Umbrellas, which symbolize the Hong Kong protests, dot the roads. Slogans are painted on posters hanging from prominent bridges -- suggesting the political power of art. Inside a prison cell . As Ai is still unable to leave China, he and his team constructed the pieces in their studio. He then sent three teams to the United States to erect the seven art installations inside Alcatraz's dining room, labor building, the psychiatric observation cells, hopsital and inside the cell block. Perhaps the most haunting of exhibits is ""Stay Tuned,"" where the voice of dissent singing or reciting a poem or speech booms inside the small, isolated prison cells. Housed inside Alcatraz Cellblock A, there's a haunting chill within the concrete mass. Each prison cell behind chipped white steel bars contains just a solitary stool and a stained white sink. Some of the cells in Block A were used for solitary confinement. Visitors can walk inside each of the 12 cells, which represent the imprisonment of dissidents like Russia's Pussy Riot, Martin Luther King Jr., and the Robben Island Singers, who were anti-Apartheid singers. They can sit inside the barren concrete cell and listen to their voices. One visit Eileen Kurahashi, sat inside each of them, closing her eyes shut. ""It's a powerful access to something so tragic and breathtaking,"" she said. The voice of dissident plays in a loop -- but the sound remains confined into a prison reminding visitors of the cost of free expression.","Chinese artist Ai Weiwei opens installation on Alcatraz island .

"(CNN) -- A cousin of Reeva Steenkamp, who was shot dead by South African athlete Oscar Pistorius, said Thursday that he should ""pay for what he has done"" with a prison sentence, as she testified at his sentencing hearing. Kim Martin, the first witness called by state Prosecutor Gerrie Nel, also dismissed suggestions that the double amputee should serve a sentence of house arrest or community service, saying that would not ""fit the crime."" ""This is not easy for me. I really believe the accused, Mr. Pistorius, needs to pay for what he has done,"" she said, sounding choked with emotion. ""My family are not people who are seeking revenge. We just feel that to take someone's life, to shoot somebody behind a door that is unarmed, that is harmless, needs sufficient punishment."" Martin, testifying for a second day, told the court that initially, she was worried about prison conditions for Pistorius, but when she realized that he'd be treated humanely, she felt he should receive jail time. ""Everybody has suffered here, and I think we need to give a message to society that you cannot do this and get away with it,"" she said. Pistorius' sentence -- custodial or not -- will be decided by Judge Thokozile Masipa, who also presided over his trial. The Olympian was cleared of murder last month but found guilty of culpable homicide, or negligently killing Steenkamp, when he fired four shots through a toilet door in his home. He said he believed there was an intruder behind the door. 'It's ruined our whole family' Martin said she was ""very fearful of the accused"" and had tried to put him out of her mind. ""We even made a point of not mentioning his name in our house because I didn't want to spend any energy thinking about him,"" she said. Defense attorney Barry Roux asked Thursday if Martin was aware that Pistorius had written letters to Steenkamp's family but under advice from his lawyers hadn't given them to the family. He said that Pistorius wants privately to apologize to the family. Martin is the only member of Reeva Steenkamp's family to have testified before the court, though the model's parents, Barry and June Steenkamp, have been present for proceedings. On Wednesday, Martin said that the health of Reeva's father, Barry Steenkamp, has suffered as a result of his daughter's death and that he had a couple of strokes. ""It's ruined our whole family. It's ruined Barry and June. Reeva was everything to them,"" she said. Prisons chief: We can accommodate Pistorius . Acting National Commissioner of Correctional Services Zach Modise told the court Thursday that the system would be able to meet Pistorius' needs as a disabled prisoner. Modise said that South Africa's prisons are used to taking in all kinds of prisoners, including juveniles and the elderly, and that there are facilities to deal with every kind of inmate. The prison system deals with 128 disabled inmates on a daily basis, he said . When an inmate enters the system, a health assessment is swiftly done to determine whether a prisoner needs a single cell, he said. He insisted that if Pistorius were given a prison term, the hospital section of Kgosi Mampuru prison in Pretoria had the facilities to accommodate his needs. ""There should be no doubt in the minds of South Africans that Mr. Pistorius and any other inmate with disabilities will be accommodated properly,"" he said. Overcrowding is an issue across the prison system, he acknowledged, but has been reduced from a rate of 63% in 2005 to 31% today. Asked about the problems of gangs and violence in prisons, Modise said that more needs to be done to eradicate gangs outside the prison system and that within the system, authorities are dealing with the issue. Roux, in questioning Modise, made the point that whether Pistorius was given a single cell in the hospital section of Kgosi Mampuru would depend on those evaluating his case when he entered prison. However, Modise's testimony indicates that he does not think Pistorius should be held in the general section of the prison, Roux said. He also raised concerns about what illnesses Pistorius could be exposed to in the hospital section -- tuberculosis is a problem in South African prisons -- and the levels of medical staffing. Probation officer Annette Vergeer, who testified earlier in the week, said she did not think that South Africa's prison system could cater adequately to a vulnerable prisoner like Pistorius. No minimum sentence . There is no legal minimum sentence for culpable homicide in South African law, so it will be up to the judge to decide. A typical sentence is five to eight years. But it is a principle of South African law that the sentence should be tailored to the culprit as a whole person, as opposed to the crime. That makes predicting a sentence difficult, said Kelly Phelps, a CNN legal analyst. The judge also found Pistorius guilty of one weapons-related charge involving a shooting at a restaurant. The maximum penalty for that is five years behind bars. But he could get a lesser sentence, such as a fine or the loss of his gun license.","Oscar Pistorius should ""pay for what he has done,"" says Reeva Steenkamp's cousin .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- In downtown Johannesburg -- once a no-go zone riddled with crime -- a young entrepreneur is sparking an urban restoration. Property developer Jonathan Liebmann is busy rejuvenating the South African city's industrial heart after years of urban decay, with his Maboneng Precinct, on the east side of Johannesburg's central business district. Maboneng -- meaning ""place of light"" in Sotho -- is now a mixed-zone neighborhood, full of shops, restaurants and residences, which comes alive at the weekend. And it could follow in the footsteps of London's trendy East End and the shabby-chic streets of Williamsburg in New York as Johannesburg's young middle class flood to the district. Read more: Africa's tech cities and mega dams . Liebmann said: ""The area has really transformed from being a rundown industrial area into being a new living and workspace for people looking for something alternative."" Liebmann and his team own 35 properties in the area and have developed 10 of those buildings since 2008. ""It's paid off financially, but it will pay off more in the medium to long term,"" he added. The Maboneng Precinct's first project, called ""Arts on Main"" is a creative hub boasting an in-house restaurant, rooftop bar and an exhibition space as well as a studio for some of South Africa's most respected artists. Read more: Fast-food giants target Africa . Prices for an apartment in Maboneng range anywhere from 280,000 rand ($28,500) to 3 million rand ($305,000), and Liebmann said that since he started buying up properties in Johannesburg, prices have sky-rocketed. ""Initially buildings were being bought for 100 euros a square meter,"" he said. ""I think prices have tripled, but that still makes it very competitive when you compare it to the suburbs. There are still very good deals to be enjoyed."" But for seemingly low prices by Western standards, Maboneng still remains an aspirational area for many of the city's 3.8 million inhabitants. Despite South Africa being the continent's largest economy, 23% of the population is below the poverty line. Liebmann said that Maboneng's continued development will have a positive impact on Johannesburg, known as the ""City of Gold,"" as other similar projects spring up around the city. ""There's always a knock-on effect,"" he said, ""it's all coming together now in total regeneration."" Another company investing in Johannesburg real estate is Kempston Group. Originally a trucking company, today Kempston Group owns 100 commercial, industrial and farming properties around South Africa. Read more: Liberia: From warzone to holiday paradise? And the firm is now taking on a mammoth project to transform the notorious Ponte City skyscraper in the heart of Johannesburg. When it was built in the 1970s, Ponte City was a desirable place to live. But having loomed over the city for nearly four decades, it became a symbol of the urban decay as the abandoned building fell victim to crime, drugs and prostitution toward the end of the last century. When it was taken over in 2001, after years of neglect, five stories of discarded trash had to be removed as the building's rejuvenation took place. Kempston Group founder Tony Cotterell, who is overseeing the renovation, explained: ""We bought in large conveyer belts with earth-moving equipment and we started moving it out."" The group has invested tens of millions of dollars into the project and has already finished renovating the residential floors. Cotterell says all of the 500 apartments currently in Ponte are occupied. ""What we're creating is an environment where people can feel safe,"" said Cotterell. ""It's a big change from where it was 15 years ago. I think the whole of Johannesburg is starting to change as well.""

"(CNN) -- A man who jumped the White House fence allegedly knocked over a female officer at the mansion's double doors before he dashed into the ornate East Room. An inquiry continues into how Omar Gonzalez, 42, made it into the White House. Investigators are looking through an elaborate closed-circuit video system showing the entire incident, a Secret Service source told CNN. Authorities said the Iraq war veteran had a knife in his pocket when he ran into the White House, where he was later subdued after a wild chase. The officer he met at the doorway got up, chased him and tackled him just outside the East Room, a source said. However, the fact that it was a female officer had nothing to do with the breach, according to the source. ""Gender was not a factor, she got one door secured but was pushed over while trying to get the second door shut,"" the source said. Neither President Barack Obama nor the first family were at home at the time of the incident on September 19. Gonzalez pleaded not guilty to federal charges Wednesday that included entering a restricted building while carrying a dangerous weapon. A federal judge ordered additional mental testing to determine whether he is competent to stand trial. White House alarm was down . An alarm box had been turned down near the front door after complaints by the White House usher's office that it was too loud. A canine unit was not released to chase Gonzalez because there were ""too many friendlies around,"" the source said. Security failure in the nation's highest office sparked calls for new leadership in the Secret Service. First female director resigns . Julia Pierson, the first female director of the Secret Service, resigned Wednesday after a subsequent congressional inquiry uncovered other security lapses. Pierson took over as director of the Secret Service in March 2013, tapped by Obama to change the culture of an agency marred by a Colombian prostitution scandal at the time. More scandals . Several male agents in an advance contingent before a presidential trip to Cartagena, Colombia, had taken prostitutes back to their hotel rooms, according to investigators. A morning-after dispute between one agent and a woman over payment led to exposure of what happened and the ensuing investigations. Nine agents eventually left or lost their jobs . Calls for Pierson to resign grew after another bombshell revelation during her testimony Tuesday on Capitol Hill that an armed security contractor was allowed to get into an elevator with the President during a recent trip to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. Pierson became the Secret Service's chief of staff in 2008. Before that, she served on the protective details of Presidents George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. New leadership . After her resignation, Homeland Security Director Jeh Johnson announced that his department would take over an internal inquiry of the Secret Service and appoint a new panel to review security at the White House. Joseph Clancy, a former special agent in charge of the Presidential Protective Division of the Secret Service, will serve as interim director, Johnson said.

"(CNN) -- A blustery nor'easter that made travel throughout the Northeast absolutely miserable Tuesday is going to stick around for a few more days. And the West Coast will get drenched, too. Record rain reports poured in from the New York metropolitan area with nearly 3 inches falling. At John F. Kennedy International Airport, 2.95 inches fell, the most on this date. Coupled with high winds -- including one gust of 47 mph -- the precipitation delayed air travel for hours. At LaGuardia Airport, where 2.65 inches fell, the delays at one point reached four hours. Heavy rain tapered off Tuesday evening, but some areas were still flooded, the New York office of the National Weather Service said. Flood warnings for three counties just north of Manhattan were issued. ""I urge all drivers to exercise caution and check conditions before getting on the road,"" Gov. Andrew Cuomo said, according to CNN affiliate WCBS. ""We are proactively deploying as many resources as necessary to assist communities in the storm's path to prepare for and manage whatever Mother Nature brings."" Earlier, the pooling water caused issues for parents. ""We're stuck at home until this dies down,"" a woman in Amityville told CNN affiliate News 12 Long Island. ""I'm not even sure if I'll be able to get my kids at school."" And there were problems for some commuters on foot. ""It's pretty bad. I'm actually trying to get home so I don't know how I'm going to get over there, I'm going to have to walk through it again,"" Sean O'Malley told WCBS of his trek through the water-logged streets of Sea Bright, New Jersey, on the Atlantic Ocean shore. ""It happens every year, it's not a surprise."" About 20 million people are under winter storm warnings and advisories in the Northeast. Snow will stay inland with over a foot of snow from northern New York to Maine. Some areas could get up to 12 inches of snow by Thursday. According to the flight tracking website FlightAware.com, more than 2,600 flights departing from and/or landing in the United States were delayed Tuesday and 1,200 were canceled. Headaches in other areas . It was also pouring in Washington state. ""1 storm down, 2 more to go,"" the headline on the website of CNN affiliate KOMO in Seattle read.

"(CNN) -- She stumbled into the business naked, bleeding and burned. And in desperate need of help. This 16-year-old girl thankfully got it, and more than a month later is in good condition at a hospital and undergoing rehab, Charles City County, Virginia, sheriff's Capt. Jayson Crawley said. And the man accused of doing this to her? Authorities say they think he is now in custody in Maryland, where he was caught coming out of a vehicle with a woman he'd allegedly abducted Sunday night in Philadelphia. The suspect in both cases is Delvin Barnes, 37. Talking about Barnes, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said authorities ""don't know much (about him) other than the fact he's a thug and this is what he does, apparently."" ""People like this, there's nothing that makes sense,"" Ramsey told reporters. ""Don't even try to find it."" Abducted Philadelphia woman found alive . Official: Teen doused with gas, bleach, set on fire . There's no way of avoiding the horror, however, of what at least two young women endured about 275 miles away and just over a month from each other. The Virginia teen went missing first, with her family calling the Charles City County Sheriff's Office on October 1. Her nightmare began when, she later told police, the teenager was hit in the head with a shovel and stuffed into the trunk of a car, according to Crawley. The girl told police that her abductor took her to his parents' house in Charles City County and sexually assaulted her. (Barnes' parents don't remember whether they were home at the time, the sheriff's captain said.) He then showed her pictures of other girls, claiming he'd done the same thing to them, according to the 16-year-old. Two days later, the suspect allegedly brought the then-naked girl into the backyard, poured bleach and gasoline on her, burned her clothes and dug a hole. ""How do you want to die?"" he asked, the teenager told police. When he got distracted, the girl fled into the woods. Two miles away, employees at a Charles City County business spotted her and brought her inside, Crawley explained. She was suffering from third-degree burns, but she was alive. Chief calls Barnes 'a vicious predator' DNA from the victim was put into a national database to try to find her abductor. On October 28, that test matched with Barnes -- the same man the teenage girl ID'd from a photo lineup of mug shots, according to Crawley. After all, Barnes had been in jail before. Crawley said that Barnes had an extensive criminal history, and an online public records search bears that out. It shows dozens of charges from over the years, from traffic infractions to use of a firearm in a robbery to aggravated assault and false imprisonment. Then there are the charges of attempted capital murder, abduction, forcible rape, malicious wounding and malicious wounding using a chemical, in the Virginia case. The latest allegation comes from Philadelphia, one of a few places (along with Charles City, Virginia Beach and Richmond in Virginia) where Barnes has lived. That's where video, released by police, showed 22-year-old Carlesha Freeland-Gaither walking just blocks from her home when she is brought to the ground and forced into a vehicle Sunday. Her glasses and cell phone drop onto the road during the struggle. But, even after she breaks out a passenger's side window, her efforts prove futile as the car pulls away. As with the Virginia case in October, authorities don't believe the victim knew her abductor. Freeland-Gaither and Barnes were found three days later in Jessup, Maryland, 15 miles southwest of Baltimore. A big reason authorities managed to track them down had do with Barnes' past, but not the criminal variety. A car dealer who had sold the vehicle allegedly used in Freeland-Gaither's abduction tipped off authorities after recognizing Barnes from a surveillance video released by police, Ramsey said. The dealer had placed a GPS in the car because of worries about Barnes' bad credit, according to Crawley. Videos, tips lead authorities to alleged abductor . Following his arrest, Barnes was booked into the Baltimore County detention center in Towson at 3:40 a.m. Thursday. He waived his extradition to Virginia. Barnes is scheduled to make an appearance in court November 12, according to Crawley. The Philadelphia police commissioner hopes Barnes will always be in the sights of law enforcement. ""He's a vicious predator. He's off the streets. And hopefully he'll be in jail for the rest of his life,"" Ramsey said. ""That's the only thing he deserves.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Negotiators on House and Senate spending panels agreed to $1.1 trillion government funding bill, they announced Tuesday, just two days before federal agencies are due to run out of money. As part of the spending bill Democrats and Republicans have also agreed to attach policy provisions on a range of issues -- including measures to roll back environmental regulations, rules for possession of marijuana in the District of Columbia, and changes to financial regulations for banks. ""This bill fulfills our constitutional duty to fund the government, preventing damage from shutdown politics that are bad for the economy, cost jobs and hurt middle class families,"" said Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski, a Democrat, and Kentucky Rep. Hal Rogers, a Republican, in a joint statement. ""While not everyone got everything they wanted, such compromises must be made in a divided government. These are the tough choices that we must make to govern responsibly and do what the American people sent us here to do."" The spending measure, which would fund most of the government for a full fiscal year was expected to be released at the beginning of the week. But on Tuesday evening, lawmakers continued to haggle over everything from immigration to terrorism risk insurance. The squabbling increased the chances that Congress will have to approve a short-term bill on Thursday to keep the government open for just a few days and give lawmakers a little more time to finalize a deal. But the last-minute agreement avoids that outcome, and likely means the government will remain open for business as usual. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid told reporters on Tuesday, ""We're ready to pass a yearlong spending bill to take care of this. We've been trying to work with Republican leaders to avoid a shutdown. There is going to come a time when they are going to have to take 'yes' for an answer. I guess they are not there yet."" A House vote on the spending bill now is expected hours before the deadline on Thursday night, which would give the Democratic-led Senate little time to debate and vote on the legislation before government operations would be interrupted by a funding gap. The House Appropriations committee unveiled their legislation late Tuesday night, which funds virtually all of the government for a full fiscal year. But in response to the President Barack Obama's action on immigration, it only provides resources for the Department of Homeland Security through the end of February. Even that doesn't go far enough for some conservatives who want to use the annual spending bill to strip funding for the implementation of the executive orders. They insist that exercising Congress' power of the purse was the best tool to use now, instead of waiting to wage the fight until next year. ""I think it's a punt,"" Arizona GOP Rep. Matt Salmon told reporters about the current House spending proposal. He predicted as many as 50 House Republicans would oppose the legislation, but said in the end, those defections wouldn't block the bill because enough Democrats would back it to avoid a shutdown. Reid and other Senate Democrats have already said they would accept the hybrid bill so long as it didn't contain poison pill policy riders. Reid's comments Tuesday reflect that he is concerned some of those riders remain in the bill. House Speaker John Boehner and Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell have been urging Republicans to postpone their effort to roll back the President's executive actions until next year when they control both the House and the Senate. GOP leaders have repeatedly told members they don't want to risk a repeat of last fall's government shutdown, which most voters blamed on the GOP. The House passed a bill last week designed to stop the President's executive order, but that measure was seen as largely symbolic -- even from its supporters -- because the Democratic-led Senate refused to hold a vote on it and the Obama administration threatened to veto it. While GOP leaders argue it's better to wait until next year when they have control of both chambers of Congress, there is no plan in place for what Republicans will actually do in 2015. Flores said he was still waiting to read the spending bill, but he agreed with the concept of separating the immigration fight from the spending bill. He said for now, the Democratic-led Senate limits the options in the face of a shutdown and ""hopefully in January we're going to have a bigger tool box"" to force the Administration to revise its policies on immigration. Last minute discussions about unrelated legislation held up the funding bill's introduction, including whether to add an unrelated terrorism risk insurance measure to the measure. Discussions over that issue led to a fight over financial regulations -- a sign the debate over the spending bill had drifted off its initial course. House Democratic leaders won't say how they will vote on the measure, but the number two Democratic leader told reporters on Tuesday that Republicans will find it easier to attract support if they leave out controversial policy provisions. ""The cleaner this bill is the more likely it is of its passage,"" said Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland. This story has been updated to include new information .","House and Senate negotiators announced a funding agreement late Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- The weekend's battle between two big-budget science fiction adventures wasn't quite as close as expected. Disney Animation's ""Big Hero 6"" scored a solid win, with the tale of a boy and his inflatable robot ringing up an estimated $56.2 million in ticket sales. Ads for the movie played up the connection to the studio's recent hits, including ""Wreck-It Ralph"" and especially ""Frozen."" The Christopher Nolan space epic ""Interstellar"" couldn't keep pace, bringing in an estimated $50 million -- and most observers think that number is more likely to fall than to rise when final numbers are released Monday afternoon. Matthew McConaughey stars as the pilot of a space expedition which leaves a dying Earth to search for a new home for humanity. How good is 'Interstellar'? If the ""Interstellar"" total holds, it'll be just the fourth time that two films debuted with $50 million or more in the same weekend. Each time that's happened, the animated film beat the live-action effort: ""WALL-E"" won out over ""Wanted"" in 2008; ""Madagascar 3"" beat ""Prometheus"" in 2012; and ""Monsters U."" surpassed ""World War Z"" in 2013. Hollywood number-crunchers will have a field day with this weekend's data: How did the extra money from IMAX tickets for ""Interstellar"" compare with the premium on 3D tickets for ""Big Hero 6""? And what about the discounted child tickets for the Disney flick? There's also the fact that ""Interstellar"" is a full hour longer -- so did that mean more showings for ""Hero,"" leading to more tickets sold? One set of stats sums it up: ""Hero"" opened in 200 more theaters, but still averaged nearly $1,000 more per theater. In short, more people simply wanted to see ""Big Hero 6."" Moviegoers also still want to see ""Gone Girl"" as well. The drama starring Ben Affleck continues to have a long box office tail, staying in the Top 5 in its sixth weekend and closing in on $150 million in domestic grosses. In limited release, ""The Theory of Everything,"" starring Oscar favorite Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Hawking, opened very strong: an estimated $206,000 in just five theaters. With ""Dumb and Dumber To"" and ""Beyond The Lights"" the only new wide releases next weekend, it's likely ""Hero"" and ""Interstellar"" each will have one more shot at No. 1; then ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1"" figures to blow everyone else out of the water when it opens on November 21. Here are the weekend domestic box office estimates from Exhibitor Relations Co., with final numbers available Monday afternoon: . 1. ""Big Hero 6"" -- $56.2 million . 2. ""Interstellar"" -- $50 million . 3. ""Gone Girl"" -- $6.1 million ($145.4 million total) 4. ""Ouija"" -- $6 million ($43.5 million total) 5. ""St. Vincent"" -- $5.7 million ($27.4 million total)","""Big Hero 6"" ads played up connection to ""Wreck-It Ralph"" and ""Frozen""

"(CNN) -- NFL teams have unanimously endorsed a new personal conduct policy for all NFL employees after discussions that included experts on domestic violence and sexual assault, the league announced Wednesday. The new measures include a more extensive list of prohibited conduct, independent investigative procedures, and specific criteria on paid leave for an individual charged with a violent crime. It also includes a six-game suspension for crimes involving violent conduct, including domestic violence and sexual assault, which Commissioner Roger Goodell had written about in an August memo to owners. The suspension could be longer if there are ""possible mitigating or aggravating circumstances."" Goodell called the enhanced policy ""significantly more robust, thorough and formal."" It applies to all NFL personnel, not just players. George Atallah, a spokesman for the NFL Players Association, said the union has not seen the new policy. ""There will be a lot of analysis about the differences in our formal proposal and what the NFL will present today on personal conduct policy,"" he tweeted before the league's announcement. ""Sadly, those discussions will be through the media, not through formal negotiations, which the NFL has said they're not interested in."" In a statement on its website, the players' union said it was never offered the professional courtesy of seeing the new policy before it was announced publicly. The National Organization for Women said the NFL is missing a vital aspect in its policy. ""The victim is an afterthought in this 'new' policy -- as she was in the old policy,"" NOW President Terry O'Neill said in a written statement. ""There is no guarantee that economic support will be there for as long as it takes for a victim to get back on her feet, and no indication that the NFL even understands that a six-game unpaid suspension could spark even higher level of violence."" A new conduct committee will include Cardinals owner Michael Bidwell, Falcons owner Arthur Blank, Chiefs owner Clark Hunt, Bears owner George McCaskey and Texans owner Robert McNair. Other members are Dee Haslam, the wife of Browns owner Jimmy Haslam; Cowboys Executive Vice President Charlotte Jones Anderson and two former players who hold ownership stakes -- Warrick Dunn and John Stallworth. Their job will be to review the policy at least once a year.","NEW: NOW denounces policy, says it excludes provisions for taking care of the victims .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- The unflinching account from a defector revealed how he picked corn kernels out of cow manure to eat as he competed with his family for food at one of North Korea's notorious prison camps. He was also forced to watch his mother's hanging and his brother's execution. He was born in a ""total control zone"" where prison authorities wield complete power, where guards beat children to death with no hesitation. A memoir detailing Shin Dong-hyuk's life, ""Escape from Camp 14"" hit the bookshelves in South Korea this month. The original English version published in March last year. Shin, 30, is the only man known to have been born and to escape from a North Korean prison known as Camp 14. His account put a human face on the abuses in North Korean prison camps, a brutal system which has survived twice as long as Stalin's Soviet gulags and much longer than the Nazi concentration camps. ""The existence of prison camps in the North should be known to the people around the world,"" Shin said. ""There are some people born and raised as an animal in North Korea. I have to explain that to everyone."" Defectors describe horror, heartbreak in North Korea's labor camps . The hope in writing the book was to raise awareness about conditions inside North Korea, said Blaine Harden, the author of ""Escape from Camp 14: One Man's Remarkable Odyssey from North Korea to Freedom in the West."" Its impact was unanticipated, said Harden, when the pair spoke at the Asan Institute last week in Seoul. In March, the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva agreed to examine what it called ""grave, widespread and systematic"" violations of human rights in North Korea, including the use of prison camps. While the book was not the sole reason, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay met with Shin and another North Korean prison camp survivor in December . The members of the commission were appointed this week. The three members will look into issues including disappearances, abductions, the control of food and use of torture in the isolated nation. The commission will give an update on its findings in September followed by a final report by March. North Korea has denied human right abuses, saying that its citizens are ""happy with pride and honor"" and that the nation has ""one of the best systems for promotion and protection of human rights in the world."" The book's impact . ""Escape from Camp 14"" has been translated into 24 languages and there are plans to adopt the book into a film. Shin has bared the scars from his 23 years in captivity North Korea -- such as burn marks on his back and his missing finger tip -- in several interviews with journalists. His story has been carried by media outlets worldwide. ""I'm grateful for people who are paying attention to the North Korean human rights situation,"" Shin said. ""It seems like they're more interested in my personal situation. I do not want that."" Shin, a slim man with wide plastic-rimmed glasses, appeared accustomed to the various questions from the audience members and journalists. ""I think the most challenging thing still today is the past heartbroken story should be explained over and over again,"" Shin said. ""And personally, I want to escape my past. I physically escaped North Korea, but still my mind, my memories live there. ""But I know there is serious cause behind my doing this kind of these sessions and explaining these things."" He spoke of a 2008 visit to the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C. where he saw a photograph of the Auschwitz prison camp in 1944. The single photo resonated with him as ""an outcry from the prison camp"" that pressed the world for help. The world ""didn't pay attention to this single photograph. Six million people had to suffer. It was shocking to me,"" he said. It inspired him to speak about the North Korean camps. The evidence of the North Korean prisons are overwhelming as more than 60 people have given detailed, consistent accounts, Harden said. ""Shin's story, these heartbreaking narratives, are a kind of abuse that Europe said, 'Never again,' to. Yet, it's going on this morning, not 250 miles from where we sit,"" Harden said from the auditorium in Seoul. Shin's testimony has brought new insights into the secretive camps, he added. For example, the concept of ""reward marriages"" was unknown until Shin told his story. These are the rewards dispensed by prison guards, who allow a male and female prisoner to have sex. Shin was a product of a reward marriage in the prison camp. The reward marriage works as an incentive for prisoners, Shin said. Shin's testimony has encouraged the world to ""grapple with the suffering,"" rather than just lampoon North Korea as a punchline, Harden said.","Shin Dong-hyuk's ""Escape from Camp 14"" released in Korean this month .

"Washington (CNN) -- A central part of the gun legislation Congress is expected to take up this week is the idea of expanded background checks on gun purchases. But few Americans understand how background checks actually work. Leaders from both sides of the aisle -- and an overwhelming number of Americans in national opinion polls -- support expanded background checks before the purchase of guns. But when it comes to specifics, the divide shows. Meanwhile, some congressional Democrats are pushing not only for expanded background checks, but also for broadening the requirement for records of sale transactions. For some Republicans and gun rights activists, the idea of any type of national gun registry is a deal-breaker. Why is this so hard? The disconnect on background checks . Here's how the current system works: . Once you have decided to purchase a gun from a retail outlet -- it could be a local gun shop or national chain such as Bass Pro Shops, Cabelas or Walmart -- the store enters your name and information into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, via a toll-free number or the Internet, to check the eligibility of the buyer. The check usually takes a few minutes to complete. The NICS system is linked to several databases managed by the FBI, including the National Crime Information Center, and runs an individual's name through federal and state criminal records. CNN Poll: Background checks popular, worrisome . Individuals can also be added to the NICS index outside of potential gun sales, on the recommendation of psychiatrists, mental health institutions and family members. Under the current NICS system, buyers may be denied the purchase of a firearm for reasons such as being indicted or convicted of a felony, admitting to being addicted to a controlled substances, having been dishonorably discharged from the Armed Forces, being subject to a restraining order, as well as other regulations. Since its implementation in 1998, 2.1 million background checks have been denied out of 118 million requests, or almost 2%. From gun hater to NRA-loving mom . The use of the NICS however is not required for private sales of firearms, which make up about 20% of all firearm transactions. A Democrat-backed bill being discussed in Congress closes this loophole, requiring background checks for all gun transactions, even private ones. This would extend background checks to purchases made at gun shows and on the internet. The current NICS is required by federal law -- the Brady Act of 1993 -- to destroy background check request records within 24 hours. Opinion: Why the NRA fights background checks . And since the passage of the Gun Control Act of 1968, licensed gun dealers -- called FFLs or Federal Firearms License holders -- are required by the ATF to also have gun purchasers to fill out a federal Form 4473, which allows law enforcement officials to trace guns to their original purchasers. That document -- which contains the name, address, date of birth, copy of ID, NICS background check transaction number and model and serial number of the gun purchased -- must be retained by the dealer for 20 years and carries with it the same federal privacy restrictions as a federal tax return. Some opponents of changes to background checks cite the ineffectiveness of the current system as a reason not to expand it. The current system cannot force states to share all of their records with the NICS database, especially ones regarding mental health. This lack of records allows some people with mental issues to legally purchase guns. Seung-Hui Cho, the shooter in the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007, had been declared mentally ill by a judge two years before he murdered 32 people. But Cho had gone through a background check and been cleared. Should anyone be able to buy guns? Share your views . Others see the expansion as another waste of government dollars, believing that people who are not likely to have background checks approved, like felons, won't even attempt the process, and instead will go straight to the black market to purchase firearms. A recent CNN/ORC poll showed that nine out of 10 Americans said that they support a background check on every gun sale. Hope grows for compromise proposal on gun control .","Few Americans understand how background checks actually work .

"(CNN) -- A combination of old and new hooked up off the coast of San Diego Monday to give the U.S. Navy a glimpse into its future. The moment was the first arrested landing aboard an aircraft carrier for the military's new Joint Strike Fighter, the F-35C Lightning II. An arrested landing means the jet was brought to a stop using a tailhook grabbing a wire stretched across the carrier's deck. The wire is attached to a gear system that brings the plane to a stop. ""This will be one landing out of thousands more that will happen over the next few decades,"" Lt. Gen. Chris Bogdan, executive officer of the Pentagon's F-35 program, said in a statement. Monday's landing came aboard the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz, the oldest active carrier in the Navy's fleet. ""I'm very excited to see America's newest aircraft on the flight deck of her oldest aircraft carrier,"" said Navy Cmdr. Tony Wilson, the test pilot who landed the F-35C aboard the Nimitz. Carrier turns donor: USS Enterprise gives anchor to USS Lincoln . Tests of the F-35C aboard the carrier will continue for a few weeks, the Navy said. It is expected to be operational in the Navy's carrier air fleet in 2018, joining F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, EA-18G Growler electronic attack aircraft, E-2D Hawkeye control aircraft, MH-60R/S helicopters and Carrier Onboard Delivery logistics aircraft, according to a Navy statement. The F-35C is just one version of the aircraft that the Pentagon has developed for use by the Marines and Air Force as well. The F-35B, the Marine Corps version, is equipped with short take-off and vertical landing capability and began testing aboard the amphibious assault ship USS Wasp in 2011. The F-35 was developed at a cost of nearly $400 billion so far and beset for years by cost overruns and delays. The plane's primary contractor, Lockheed Martin, puts the cost of each F-35C -- the most expensive of the three versions -- at $116 million, not including the engine. The company says on its website that the price has dropped 55% since the initial planes were contracted. Engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney said last month it has been awarded a contract worth just over $1 billion for a batch of 48 engines for the F-35. The Pentagon ultimately wants more than 2,400 of the fighter jets, while hundreds more are expected over time to go to allies such as South Korea, Japan and Australia. More than 100 planes have been built so far, most for testing, but the program is still in its development and training phases. The jets were temporarily grounded earlier this year following a fire on the runway at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. No one was hurt. The military says the stealth fighter will be ""the most affordable, lethal, supportable and survivable aircraft ever to be used"" by so many services worldwide.

Laura Carmichael, who plays the perpetually unfortunate Edith, said that things still aren't looking up for her character. ""Mary doesn't know Edith has a daughter,"" Dockery said. ""So Edith certainly won't get any sympathy from her unknowing sister."" Actually, quite the opposite: ""Mary's mean to Edith especially in this season,"" Dockery went on. ""Me and Laura love it when they're mean to each other, it's more fun to do."" As for those downstairs, Leech is just thankful his Tom Branson's still on the show after the death of Sybil. And Joanne Froggatt's Anna and Brendan Coyle's Mr. Bates are talking about maybe having some kids ... when Anna's not questioning whether Mr. Bates is a murderer, that is.

"(CNN) -- The United States is an exceptional nation. As a people, we are not bound by blood, nationality, ethnicity or religion. Instead, we are connected by the core belief that it does not matter where you came from; it matters only where you are going. This belief is what makes our country unique. It is also what makes education critically important, more so today than ever. While our political leanings may be different, our careers have taught us that education is inextricably linked to the strength of this country and our leadership in the international community. Today, globalization and the technological sophistication of our economy are widening already troubling socioeconomic disparities, rewarding those who acquire the right skills and punishing brutally those who do not. Much is at stake. It is not hyperbole to say that the state of education in our country is a challenge to our national security. Human capital has never been more important for success in our increasingly competitive world economy. Yet, although the United States invests more in education than almost any other developed nation, its students rank in the middle of the pack in reading and toward the bottom in math and science. On average, U.S. students have fallen behind peers in Korea and China, Poland and Canada and New Zealand. This puts us on a trajectory toward massive failure. Our schools simply must do better. It is essential, too, that we provide a base of knowledge for our students in order to produce citizens who can serve in the Foreign Service, the intelligence community and the armed forces. The State Department is struggling to recruit enough foreign language speakers, U.S. generals are cautioning that enlistees cannot read training manuals for sophisticated equipment, and a report from the XVIII Airborne Corps in Iraq found that out of 250 intelligence personnel, fewer than five had the ""aptitude to put pieces together to form a conclusion."" Schools of Thought blog: Report calls education a national security issue . For the United States to maintain its role of military and diplomatic leadership, it needs highly qualified and capable men and women to conduct its foreign affairs. Knowledge of the world and of foreign languages is essential. Finally, we must also foster a deeper understanding of America's core institutions and values. Successfully educating our young people about our country, its governmental institutions and values — what is sometimes called ""civics"" — is crucial to our coherence as a population and for informed citizenry. A year ago, we brought together leaders in education, politics, business, academia and the armed forces and diplomatic communities to assess the nation's educational challenges in the context of national security. We believe education is posing direct threats to our nation: to economic growth, to intellectual property and competitiveness, to the protection of U.S. physical safety and to U.S. global awareness, unity and cohesion. Based on our consultations with these leaders, we offer three recommendations that build upon our core American strengths and the work already under way in schools, districts and states across the nation. America must compete successfully globally, but reform must have a distinctly American character, tapping our creativity, capacity for innovation and the power of competition. Our recommendations are as follows: . • Implement educational expectations and assessments in subjects vital to protecting national security. States should expand the Common Core State Standards and implement assessments that more meaningfully measure student achievement. Children in every state must have strong foundations in science, technology, and foreign language, and skills like creative thinking and problem solving if they are to be competitive nationally and globally. • Make structural changes to provide all students with meaningful choices. States and school districts should give parents a much wider range of educational options so children are not trapped in failing schools. Choice is especially important for poor parents who are more likely to live in districts with underperforming schools; mobility gives these children vital options. Enhanced choice and competition among schools, in an environment of equitable resource allocation, will fuel the innovation necessary to transform results. • Launch a ""national security readiness audit"" to hold schools and policymakers accountable for results and to raise public awareness. We need a stronger and more coordinated effort to assess school-level information — from basic educational outcomes, like the proportion of students passing courses and graduating from high school to specific national security-related skills, such as mastering foreign languages and computer skills. America's greatest strengths stem from the freedom to innovate, create, compete and succeed. Without a wide base of educated and capable citizens, our strengths will fade, and the United States will lose its capacity to lead in the international community. We embarked on this project because we believe the crucial question for our generation is whether, on our watch, the American dream becomes the American memory. We hope and believe that if the country refocuses and reprioritizes, the American dream can be sustained for future generations. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Joel I. Klein and Condoleezza Rice.","Condoleezza Rice and Joel Klein: Education essential to America's strength, yet nation lags .

"(CNN) -- Daniel Radcliffe has blown the Internet's collective mind, but this time not with his acting. No, it's his rap skills that took everyone by surprise on Tuesday night's ""Tonight Show."" The 25-year-old actor was on the program to promote his new movie ""Horns,"" and talk turned to his love of music. Radcliffe's a known fan of hip-hop and counts Eminem as one of his favorite artists. ""I was the first kid in my class to learn 'The Real Slim Shady,'"" Radcliffe told host Jimmy Fallon. ""I've always had an obsession with memorizing (lyrically) complicated, intricate and fast songs."" But it wasn't a Slim Shady track that Fallon asked him to perform -- it was Blackalicious' tongue-twisting ""Alphabet Aerobics."" When Fallon handed Radcliffe the mic, the actor calmly slipped out of his jacket and began to give a jaw-dropping performance without breaking a sweat or stumbling over a line. The reaction? Total shock. ""Daniel Radcliffe rapping Blackalicious on @FallonTonight is one of my top five favorite things that have ever happened on this planet,"" said one viewer. ""Alert: Daniel Radcliffe is rapping in an American accent on #FallonTonight and it is AMAZING,"" tweeted another.

"(CNN) -- Landon Donovan, arguably the greatest American soccer player of all time, has announced his retirement from the game. The 32-year old LA Galaxy striker, who was also the U.S. national team's all time top scorer, made the announcement after scoring the winning goal in the MLS All Stars match against Bayern Munich Wednesday. ""After careful deliberation and after many conversations with those closest to me, I have decided that this will be my last season as a professional soccer player,"" Donovan wrote in a statement published on the LA Galaxy's official website. ""I feel incredibly blessed and lucky to have played a role in the remarkable growth of MLS and US Soccer during my playing career. And while my career as a player will soon be over, rest assured I will stay connected on many levels to the beautiful game."" Donovan had become one of the most recognizable U.S. soccer stars outside of his home country. In England he became something of a cult figure after two successful loan spells at Premier League side Everton. But it was for a string of incredible performances for the U.S. national team, and for his partnership with David Beckham whilst both men were at LA Galaxy, that he will be most fondly remembered. He played at both the 2006 and 2010 World Cup finals. Whilst every fan will have a favorite moment, be it winning the Gold Cup or scoring against Brazil in the Confederations Cup, It was his last-minute goal in the 2010 finals against Algeria that perhaps best defines his career. Not only did it take the U.S. into the second round, more importantly, it improbably won them the group ahead of England. Despite hopes he would shine for the US team in Brazil this summer, he was a shock omission from coach Jurgen Klinsmann's squad. But, paying tribute to the MLS' all time top scorer, US Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati hailed Donovan's contribution to the game's rise in the U.S. ""When the story of the growth of US Soccer is told, Landon Donovan will be one of the central figures,"" he said. ""Landon achieved unprecedented success as he emerged as the face of US Soccer, and helped bring the game to another level. Donovan himself gave no hint as to his plans in retirement other than helping soccer to continue to put down roots in the U.S. ""As we enter a transformative time for the sport, I will do everything I can to help the continued growth of soccer in the United States,"" he said. ""I look forward to making a difference, pursuing my passions and meeting all of you along the way in this next phase of my life.""","Landon Donovan has retired from professional soccer .

"(CNN) -- Events in North Korea have left the world wondering: Where's leader Kim Jong Un and is he still running perhaps the most isolated country on Earth? Some analysts speculate Kim may have been ousted by an old guard from the era of his late father, whose 2011 death put the son in power. First, Kim Jong Un gained a lot of weight. Then he developed a limp. Now the 31-year-old leader has been out of the public eye since September 3, during which he missed an important state meeting and, more recently, a meeting Tuesday to mark the 17th anniversary of his father's election as general secretary of the Workers' Party. Those events may not seem like much. After all, Kim could merely be ill, analysts say. In fact, official North Korean media said Kim was ""suffering from discomfort,"" with no elaboration. But a surprise weekend visit by the No. 2 and No. 3 leaders of North Korea to South Korea has many wondering if bigger intrigue is afoot. Those two leaders plus another top official attended the closing of the Asian Games and then told the South that the North is willing to hold high-level meetings this fall, according to the South. Though such talks have been attempted in the past, a new round could be significant toward advancing any potential reconciliation on the long divided Korean peninsula. Which raises the question, where is Kim? And why did the North make a last-minute visit to the South? Is Kim Jong Un lying low? 'It's unprecedented' ""I don't think anybody outside of Pyongyang really knows,"" said analyst Michael Green of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""The fact that the No. 2 and No. 3 people in the North Korean system traveled out of North Korea at the same time, after the No. 1 Kim Jong Un has been out of the public eye for weeks, and his wife as well, is very unusual,"" Green added. ""It's unprecedented."" It's enough to lead some to wonder whether something of a coup has taken place. ""Has North Korea's Kim Jong Un been toppled?"" analyst Gordon G. Chang wrote this week in the Daily Beast. ""Of course, in the world's most opaque regime, almost any scenario is plausible. We should know a lot more, however, when we see who is on the reviewing stand during the October 10 celebration of the founding of the Workers' Party. ""Until then, we can say there are signs that Kim Jong Un has lost substantial power and will soon become, if he is not already, a figurehead,"" Chang wrote. Citing sources, the Daily Beast also reported last week that North Korea imposed a ban on new travel passes for entering or leaving the country. Ambassador avoids Kim health question . On Tuesday, Ri Tong Il, deputy ambassador from North Korea to the United Nations, declined to respond to CNN's questions about whether such reports mean something larger, such as instability and pending change within the regime. The ambassador did address travel issues within the country and said that citizens have the right to travel. When asked about the condition of Kim, the ambassador deflected the question and said he had a ""program"" to attend and left. A North Korean defector, Jang Jin-Sung, who was a prominent propagandist for Kim Jong Un's late father, said the junior Kim is already a ""puppet"" of a shadowy oligarchy. A 'symbolic' leader . An old guard who make up the Organization and Guidance Department, or OGD, are the real ""power holders,"" Jang said via telephone from South Korea last week. They were tied closely to the late Kim and are not beholden to his son, he said. ""Kim Jong Un is a symbolic head of state,"" Jang said. ""Symbolically he became Supreme Leader. He did not necessarily inherit all the loyalties, the trust, the connections, experiences. He came in as a newcomer, and his position in the system is not the same."" Jang, who defected to South Korea almost a decade ago, said he has spoken with highly placed sources within the regime in recent days. The OGD, he said, ""are calling the shots, and not the words of one man they do not know. Basically, they're no longer loyal to the ruling king's word,"" Jang said. Neither CNN nor U.S. intelligence officials can confirm whether Jang's claims are credible, but Ken Gause -- who has studied North Korea for two decades for CNA Corp., a nonprofit agency that provides research and analysis to U.S. government agencies -- agreed that the OGD has enormous clout. The idea that Kim was ousted by the OGD is a theory ""that you sometimes hear from European diplomatic personnel that are stationed in North Korea,"" said Victor Cha, a professor at Georgetown University. ""Some evidence of this are pictures, propaganda pictures we see of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, that are unflattering pictures that show his girth or that show the back of his head,"" Cha said. ""These are apparently all signs by the OGD that they are in control more than this young fellow is."" Simply ill . Jonathan Pollack, who specializes in East Asian issues for the Brookings Institution, downplayed the likelihood of a power struggle in Pyongyang. He said that high-level maneuvering to influence Kim is a more likely scenario than any effort to strip him of power. ""This is a top-down system. There is no No. 2,"" Pollack said. ""It is a royal system, a dynastic system predicated on there being a Kim and then, dare I say, a 'next of Kim' able to wield authoritative power from the top on an unquestioned basis."" The other dominant theory is that Kim is simply ill. After all, Kim has a family history of diabetes, obesity and sumptuous living, analysts said. ""Kim Jong Un combines all that plus the worst of Western pop culture, Cokes and French fries ...,"" Green said. Andrei Lankov, an analyst at Seoul's Kookmin University, doubts Kim is in political hot water. ""People get sick,"" he said. ""I wouldn't make much of it."" Why North reaches out to South . Lankov said he believes Kim is still in charge and orchestrated Saturday's remarkable visit that occurred in the South. ""North Korean diplomacy has been engaged in concerted, well-arranged, well-managed efforts to improve relations with pretty much the entire outside world. And you would not expect it to happen with nobody in control,"" he said. The reason for the North's friendlier approach bears upon economics, he said. ""They want South Korean money and they want normal trade, which is subsidized by South Korea,"" Lankov said. In particular, the North would like the South to lift the so-called May 24 Measure, a heavy trade sanction taken in 2010 after the North Korean military sank a South Korean ship, killing 46 sailors. If the worst of political skullduggery has occurred -- that is, Kim is out of power -- then North Korea becomes a place of greater concern, Cha said. ""If this guy is no longer in play, and we don't know that, but let's say he is, he is no longer in place, there's no clear line of succession,"" Cha said. ""If there's an internal power struggle, we don't know the security of the nuclear weapons, the security of the missiles, and it can be manifested in terms of conventional military acts against the South, either intentionally or inadvertently that can then trigger greater prices on the peninsula,"" Cha said. ""So stuff that happens inside of North Korea can certainly affect folks on the outside in very bad ways."" CNN's Brian Todd, Dugald McConnell, Lorenzo Ferrigno, KJ Kwon, Ben Brumfield and Cameron Tankersley contributed to this report.","Kim's monthlong absence from public provokes speculation on whether he's been ousted .

"(CNN) -- Protesters took to St. Louis streets for a second night Thursday after an off-duty officer killed a teen who fired at him three times, authorities said. Chants of ""no justice, no peace"" rang into the night as crowds rallied after the Wednesday evening shooting. ""We pay you. You're our employees!"" a protester shouted. Police arrested eight people: five on accusations of unlawful assembly, two for alleged property damage and one on a marijuana possession charge, St. Louis police spokeswoman Schron Jackson said. One officer suffered minor injuries and two police cruisers were damaged, Jackson said. ""I think the officers showed a tremendous amount of restraint,"" St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson told CNN affiliate KMOV. Protesters also burned at least one American flag, CNN affiliate KSDK reported. That didn't go over well with some. ""These protesters in Saint louis burning American flags makes me sick,"" Twitter user AllenVA75 posted. ""brave men and women in uniform died for that flag, and they burn it?"" But others defended the burning. Twitter user PontifexMonty said ""people really getting mad that they're burning the flag in St. Louis. not about the black teens that are dead, the burning flag."" The teenager, Vonderrit Deondre Myers, was struck by seven or eight bullets, said Dr. Michael Graham, a St. Louis medical examiner . ""All but one gunshot wound were to the lower extremities,"" Graham said. ""The one fatal wound was to the head."" Police said the teen fired a pistol three times at an off-duty St. Louis officer who was wearing his uniform while moonlighting for a security company. The officer fired back 17 times, authorities said. Angry protesters pointed out similarities to the August killing of Michael Brown in nearby Ferguson. Myers and Brown were both 18, African-American and killed by white police officers. One big difference: Police said Brown was unarmed. iReport video: Shots fired at St. Louis protest . ""It's a clear case of this young man being gunned down by an insensitive white officer who was off-duty,"" Akbar Muhammad, who also is a member of a coalition calling for the officer who shot Brown to be prosecuted, told CNN affiliate KTVI. Neil Bruntrager, a lawyer for the St. Louis Police Officers' Association, dismissed accusations that 17 shots were excessive. ""When he uses deadly force, he uses deadly force until the threat is gone,"" he said on ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" Without video of the incident or unbiased witnesses, the police and the public must rely on physical evidence, he said. A 9 mm pistol allegedly fired by Myers was found at the scene, police said. It was jammed, which shows that it had been fired, Bruntrager said. But Van Jones, a civil rights activist and CNN contributor, said there's a lot of police mistrust after the Brown killing. ""You're seeing a wholesale breakdown of trust,"" he said. The officer, a six-year veteran who has not been named, was placed on administrative leave. He served two tours of duty with the military in Iraq and was awarded a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart, Bruntrager said. While on patrol, the officer saw three men run away as he approached, Dotson said. He chased them after one held up his pants in a way that made the officer believe he may be carrying a gun, Dotson said. The officer tussled with one teen, who ran off, then turned around and fired at least three shots toward him, Dotson said. The officer returned fire, killing the teen. Additional marches are planned over the weekend around the St. Louis region, organizers said. CNN's Shawn Nottingham contributed to this report.","NEW: Flag burning at protest provokes strong reactions .

"Incheon, South Korea (CNN) -- The number of crew members charged is rising, and so is the anger that families feel. But there's one crew member they are leaving out: Park Jee Young, 22, who by witness accounts helped passengers escape and distributed life jackets -- one after the other to students -- as the stricken ferry began to sink. When she ran out of jackets, she ran to the next floor to grab more. When she was asked why she wasn't wearing a life jacket, Park said that crew members would be last and that she had to help others first, according to witness accounts to South Korean media. Park's body now lies in a funeral home in the city of Incheon. She is one of the more than 100 people dead; 215 remain missing. The other day, a man with injuries to his head showed up to the funeral room where Park's memorial stands. When asked by Park's family who he was, the man said that he had been injured in the ferry and that he was ""indebted"" to the young woman who placed a towel on his bloody head and helped him as the water rose. ""She was so responsible and so kind,"" said her grandmother, Choi Sun Dok, 75, who sat on the floor, slumped against a wall, no longer able to stand. Her family members kneeled with her, holding her hand and weeping together on the floor. White mums and lilies, which signify death, poured in from strangers, covering the hallway leading to her memorial room. The flowers contain messages like ""We will not forget your noble spirit."" ""We will always remember your sacrifice."" ""Hero."" An online petition has gone up urging the government to award her a Good Samaritan award. Her relatives say Park wanted to stay in college, but she felt responsible for supporting her family after her father passed away two years ago. So she dropped out and joined the ferry company in 2012. She was transferred to a bigger ship, the Sewol, about six months ago, because she had proved her capabilities, her relatives said. The Sewol's sinking has left many appalled by the alleged actions of several members of the crew -- including the captain, who now faces a series of criminal charges for his role in last week's sinking. ""This is so unfair that our Jee Young had to die while the captain ran away,"" said her aunt, who declined to give her name. ""Jee Young was so responsible, and the captain just ran away."" Over two-thirds of those on board were students on a high school field trip, many of whom remain missing. Students grieve in hometown . The students attended Danwon High School in Ansan, a leafy suburb of Seoul. The high school is missing most of its sophomores, and classes are to resume Thursday. Those who are not students, teachers or parents were not allowed on school grounds to allow those to grieve privately. Well-wishers milled outside the school gate, writing Post-it notes and signs with messages of hope and encouragement. ""Brothers and sisters, please come back,"" one read. Judith Ambe, a local college student who knew about 10 of the missing students through her church, stood outside, silently praying. ""I just hope, maybe, they could be found alive,"" Ambe said, wiping her tears. ""I'm hoping God will intervene."" ""It feels so empty now,"" said student Kim Song Kyum, 17. ""It's not an environment where you can study now."" Every student there knows someone who has died or gone missing, the teenagers said. ""I want everything to be a lie,"" high school student Oh Hae Youn said. ""When I wake up in the morning, I feel like everything feels right. Then, I realize it's not. I just wish everything was a lie.""","More crew members have been charged in the Sewol sinking incident .

"(CNN) -- U.S. and Australian officials are warning of an online threat against international teachers in the Middle East.

""It makes specific mention of two schools in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (American International School and Advanced Generations School) and the suburb of Ma'adi, in Cairo, Egypt, where numbers of teachers at international schools reside."" The U.S. Embassy in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, issued a similar warning on October 27, citing schools in the areas of Jeddah and the Cairo suburb of Maadi as examples of potential targets. But the mission in Riyadh also said it was unaware of any specific, credible threat against any American school or person in Saudi Arabia. The U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi offered several tips for staying safe, including: . â€¢ Avoiding crowds and large gatherings. â€¢ Having a plan of what to do if demonstrations or violence starts. â€¢ Keeping a low profile while in public.","A post on a jihadist website encourages attacks against foreign teachers .

"(CNN) -- It may seem like a simple soup-based dish, but Japanese ramen can be surprisingly complex. To chart its different flavors is to embark on a journey along a road of influences and regional variations that has more twists and tangles than a mouthful of noodles. Sure, there are the basic four ramen styles. There's Shoyu with its heavy soy sauce seasoning; it's lighter version, shio; miso made with salty dollops of fermented soy beans; and tonkotsu, made by cooking pork bones overnight until the soup is creamy-white. Venture out into the far reaches of the country, however, and the ingredients change -- what started as a simple four can now be categorized into dozens of local styles. Ramen emerged as a national food trend in post-war Japan as a growing train network took tourists to the country's far reaches, where they soon began sampling local dishes. Tokyoites raved about what they were finding on their weekend jaunts, demanding more and ramen shops were quick to cash in. Hokkaido's miso ramen . Nowhere did this with as much success as Sapporo, on the northern island of Hokkaido. It was here that in 1955 a customer asked the chef at one eatery, Aji no Sanpei (Daimaru Fujii Sentral Building 4/F; +81 11 231 0377) to put noodles into his miso soup. Miso ramen was born. Over the years, the soup got thicker, the curly, yellow noodles were perfected and their popularity spread across the island. Today, there are miso ramen shops across the country that owe their success to essentially what was an accident. The most famous shops in Sapporo still pull in lines down the street. Asahikawa's shoyu ramen . Not all ramen in Hokkaido is miso. Just a 90 minute express train ride northeast of Sapporo is Asahikawa, a town with enough ramen shops in the vicinity of the station to warrant an official ramen map. A completely different style from Sapporo, Asahikawa's soup is a hearty shoyu ramen, with a broth made from pork and chicken bones, then mixed with a seafood concoction. The style didn't catch on like miso, and most ramen hunters have to head to the source to sample a good bowl. The shops credited with inventing the style, Hachiya (5-Jodori, 7 Chome, Asahikawa-shi, Hokkaido; +81 16 623 3343) and Aoba (Nijo Building 1/F, 2-Jodori 8 Chome, Asahikawa-shi, Hokkaido; +81 166 23 2820) are still doing business. Muroran's curry ramen . While Sapporo and Asahikwa ramen gained popularity through word of mouth, the city of Muroran took a more strategic approach. After deciding that an unusual curry ramen created in 1965 by local shop Aji no Dai O (Chuocho 2-9-3, Muroran-shi, Hokkaido; +81 143 23 3434) had failed to get the attention it deserved, the city in 2006 formed the official Muroran Curry Ramen Group to promote its wares. It worked. Muroran now boasts the fourth most popular ramen recipe in Hokkaido (number three is Hakodate's simple shio ramen). Kyushu's tonkotsu ramen . Another immensely popular style is tonkotsu from Kyushu in southwestern Japan. Simmering pork bones for days on end yields two results: a stench somewhere between fine cheese and old socks, and a creamy, delicious soup. Tonkotsu owes its creation to another happy accident. In 1947 a chef at Sankyu, a restaurant in the city of Kurume, accidentally left a pot of pork bones on high heat for much too long. The result was surprisingly tasty. Tonkotsu ramen quickly spread around the island of Kyushu, with two other towns, Kumamoto and Hakata,adapting this style with their own twists. In Hakata, food carts known as yatai embody the local ramen spirit. Set up daily along the rivers in the Tenjin district, these no-nonsense stands serve bowls of milky-white soup from the time the sun goes down until well into the morning. Kyushu's Kumamoto ramen . Kumamoto ramen, though sharing the same roots as Hakata, is made by mixing in a touch of chicken stock and about two fistfuls of garlic. The garlic comes in the form of a black oil called mayu, as well as fried garlic chips served table-side. Like its cousin in Hakata, Kumamoto ramen is a late night specialty. Tokyo's trends . Of course, Tokyo is a key player in regional ramen styles. It's the ramen battleground of Japan, where new shops open and close daily. Although the hope of kicking off a new ramen trend is quite strong, most outlets stick to the roots of Tokyo ramen -- shoyu, often flavored with niboshi. Niboshi are dried sardines that give the broth a slightly bitter, fishy taste. Mixed with a soy base, it's similar to Chinese recipes but traces its roots to Ogikubo, an area just 10 minutes from Tokyo's busy business center. The original Ogikubo ramen has spawned countless copies, but its 1931 creator, a shop called Harukiya (1-4-6 Kamiogi, Suginami-ku, Tokyo-to; +81 33 391 4868), still has lines down the block on the weekend. Shoyu variations . Tokyo isn't alone when it comes to shoyu ramen, although there are, of course, regional variations. Aomori in the north adds copious amounts of niboshi. Kitakata, a city in the west of Fukushima, does a lighter-than-average shoyu that finds its way onto the breakfast table in many homes. Nagoya adds spicy hot peppers and calls it Taiwan Ramen. Onomichi in Hiroshima prefecture dumps mounds of pork back fat onto theirs. Even Hachioji, a city less than 30 minutes from Ogikubo, makes their own style of ramen by adding freshly diced onions into the mix. It doesn't stop there. New styles are constantly being created and forgotten as chefs try to conjure up the next big thing. Just when you think you've tasted them all, there's always one more bowl to try...

"London (CNN) -- More than a decade after the Iraq war, when one million people took to the streets to protest against intervention, British lawmakers have again been grappling with their consciences. In 2003, then-Prime Minister Tony Blair won a vote authorizing the use of force as part of a U.S.-led coalition to overthrow Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, but the war's chaotic aftermath left a bitter legacy. Last year British Prime Minister David Cameron lost a vote to bomb the Assad regime in Syria amid public opposition to another war. Political commentators said the failed vote by Washington's long-standing ally put a brake on President Barack Obama's plans to punish the Syrian leader for allegedly using chemical weapons on his own people. However, the task of Obama in building a coalition is likely to be made easier after Cameron easily won Friday's vote, by 524 votes to 43, authorizing the airstrikes against ISIS targets in Iraq. The opposition Labour Party supported the action against the Islamic militant group, despite doubts of some lawmakers on both sides of the House of Commons. Opinion polls also suggest backing for action has grown following the release of videos showing the beheadings of western hostages. In August opinion was evenly split (37-36%), according to one YouGov poll, but is now markedly more in favor (53-26%). Polling by Comres conducted before the death of British hostage David Haines also found similar backing for airstrikes: more than half of those who took part in the survey backed action -- a rise of 5% in a month. Cameron recalled Parliament after Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi requested British military support in its battle against ISIS. Fighter planes from France and the United States have already started bombing in Iraq, but unlike in those countries the convention in Britain is for lawmakers to vote in Parliament before action is taken. Veteran political commentator Robin Oakley said MPs were more in tune with the public than a year ago. ""The degree of ISIS' brutality has changed a considerable number of minds. ""People who previously had doubts are now convinced that there is no alternative but force. Voices will be raised: some MPs believe that bombing ISIS may radicalize the population in areas that it controls. Local people who never liked the al-Maliki government and who may have been suffering ISIS may now offer it their support."" Oakley said it was the brutal videos that had likely won over lawmakers -- in contrast to the Syria vote. ""Last year Labour couldn't support the action because MPs felt there was no conclusive evidence that al-Assad had used chemical weapons against his own people. ""MPs will worry about 'mission creep' when there is no obvious aim apart from to eradicate ISIS. Military action may destroy the leaders but it cannot eradicate ideas -- so the fear among lawmakers is that this intervention could be counter-productive."" Outside Parliament, there were also doubts about the military action. Protests took place in central London on Thursday, organized by Stop the War. The group's spokesman Ian Chamberlain said that while it was important to listen to public opinion, ""once people start to see the results and start to reflect, I believe support will fall."" ""Public support for military interventions in Afghanistan collapsed after the results of the bombing became clear. Bombing increases sectarian hatred of the west, and it's obvious that military intervention doesn't work. You can't destroy terrorism by bombing infrastructure. It just brings more terrorism.""","Iraq war's chaotic aftermath left bitter political legacy in UK .

"Derry, New Hampshire (CNN) -- The war over women arrived in New Hampshire this week -- in the form of a press release. ""New Shaheen Campaign Ad Highlights Scott Brown's Anti-Choice Record and Extreme Bill He Introduced,"" reporters were informed Tuesday morning by email, just hours before Sen. Jeanne Shaheen was to host a women's-themed campaign event in Derry. Shaheen's ad is a brutal one -- particularly against someone who is a self-proclaimed ""pro-choice independent Republican."" In ominous tones, the ad reveals that when he was a state legislator in Massachusetts, the state Brown used to live in and later represented in the U.S. Senate, he backed a bill that would ""force women considering abortion to look at color photographs of developing fetuses."" Though Democrats in tough races nationwide have been running on women's issues for the better part of a year, the message had not taken center stage in New Hampshire's Senate race until this week. The shift foreshadows what could be a rough and tumble end to election season in this typically tranquil New England state. Brown is less vulnerable to the ""war on women"" attack than other down-the-line conservative Republicans -- one reason the issue is only now surfacing in the race. Beyond his pro-choice stance, he has broken with his party by supporting the Violence Against Women Act and funding for Planned Parenthood. But Shaheen's new offensive struck a nerve, forcing Brown to throw together a slapdash press conference to respond to her ""despicable attacks."" He was thrown off-message on a day when he was supposed to be talking about foreign policy and tying Shaheen to President Obama and his in-the-dumps poll numbers. The next morning, Brown went up with a defensive television ad stressing his support for abortion rights and accusing the senator of running a ""smear campaign."" Shaheen, a cunning, no-holds-barred campaigner despite her pleasant demeanor, is leaving nothing to chance as she clings to a steady single-digit lead in a treacherous political environment for Democrats. In the latest poll of the race this week, from WMUR and the University of New Hampshire, Shaheen led Brown by 6 points, but she was topping out at 47%: the under-50 danger zone for any incumbent. But she has a healthy 15-point advantage among likely women voters, and is doing everything she can to keep it that way. ""You get the sense this race could turn at just a moment's notice,"" said James Pindell, the always-on political director at Manchester television station WMUR. Pindell was joining me for a slice of pepperoni at Romano's Pizza in Derry for this week's episode of ""Hambycast."" ""The race seems to be primed for that,"" Pindell said. ""It gets all the attention in this state. This state has got four major races. We have two congressional races and a competitive governor's race. But all people talk about is Shaheen and Brown, every single day."" At her lone campaign event Tuesday, inside a Derry-based food incubator called Creative Chef Kitchens, Shaheen rattled through a laundry list of female-focused issues she supports â€” equal pay, access to contraception, abortion rights â€” as a small crowd of women nodded in approval. The message was heavy-handed and impossible to miss, but Shaheen put an exclamation point on it just in case: ""Scott Brown,"" she said, ""is being disingenuous when he says he is pro-choice."" Reporters surrounded her after her appearance. One asked her why she waited until October to thrust women's issues into the campaign, using ""probably the most negative ad of the campaign."" Shaheen has highlighted the topic before, memorably in July, after Brown hid in a restaurant bathroom when a reporter asked him about the Supreme Court's controversial decision in Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby that allowed corporations to deny birth control coverage in their insurance plans. But her campaign had not put money behind a television ad on women's health before, particularly such a blistering one. ""I think this is something that we planned to talk about all along,"" Shaheen responded. ""I think access to health care, access to reproductive choice is critical to women. I've worked on it my entire career. This is an issue that is important to women and families. Ninety-nine percent of women use contraceptives at some point in their lives."" Then I asked Shaheen about Brown's topic of choice: President Obama, whose disapproval ratings in New Hampshire approach 60%. What is it about him, exactly, that Democrats are so wary of? Shaheen would rather not talk about Obama, which is why Brown spent their first one-on-one debate on Monday reminding voters that the senator has voted with the president ""99% of the time."" It's one reason he has seized on the ascendancy of ISIS, the terrorist group roiling Syria and Iraq, and border security. National security is becoming a winning talking point, Republican operatives here argue, claiming it scores points among the very women Shaheen is trying to keep in her fold. ""There is a leadership void,"" Brown said at an event Tuesday in Derry, where he was joined by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a foreign policy hawk and potential presidential candidate in 2016. ""Our allies don't trust us, and our foes don't fear or respect us."" Like Republican candidates across the country, Brown wants the race to be about national issues. Shaheen does not, so she brings up another sore point for Brown: his decision to sell his home in Massachusetts last year and move to the Granite State to run for Senate. Brown is not exactly a carpetbagger -- he's long owned property in New Hampshire and many thousands of people have moved here from somewhere else thanks to the low tax rates â€” but it's still a reliable campaign jab. ""This race is not about President Obama,"" Shaheen said. ""This race is about Scott Brown and me. I know that Scott Brown would like to be running against the President, because he has not done anything in New Hampshire, he doesn't have a history here, he just moved here. I have spent my entire professional life here in New Hampshire.""","Jeanne Shaheen releases a campaign ad hitting Scott Brown's record on abortion .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- A bomb-laden vehicle exploded near a hospital controlled by Houthis in the northeastern province of Mareb on Sunday, killing at least seven, several local sources told CNN. The Houthis had engaged in protests that essentially halted life in the Yemeni capital until last week, when Yemen's President, Houthi rebels and major political parties reached a deal to bring an end to the violence. At least two dozen Houthis were injured in Sunday's attack, with three in critical condition, according to eyewitnesses in Al Gafra district of Mareb. Houthi officials, also known as Ansarullah, refused to comment on details of the attack to CNN. A Twitter account with links to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility in the attack. The Yemeni government did not immediately blame any group for the attack. Don't know much about Yemen? Learn more here . Houthis, who follow the Zaidi sect of Shia Islam, seized control of Al Gafra, a highway district connecting Mareb to the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, after four days of clashes with local tribes that ended two weeks ago. Mareb has long been a Sunni tribal stronghold. Experts say the attack against the Houthis is no surprise. ""After the Houthi victory in Sanaa, zl Qaeda knows that Houthis will plan to expand to new areas, mainly Mareb and Baitha provinces. The more they infiltrate Mareb, the more car bombs will target their fighters,"" said AbdulSalam Mohammed, president of the Sanaa-based Abaad Strategic Center. On Saturday, Houthi gunmen surrounded the residence of the National Security Bureau Chief, resulting in clashes with his guards. Seven people were killed in the confrontation. Houthis are demanding that major changes within the bureau take place, which includes sacking the current chief. They claim the bureau works closely with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Last week, a U.N.-brokered deal ended more than a month of tense protests by Houthi supporters that resulted in hundreds of people being killed or injured. The deal calls for a ceasefire and for a prime minister to be announced by President Abdurabu Hadi within three days of the signing. No announcement has been made by the government though the deadline passed 48 hours ago. Before the deal was signed, Prime Minister Mohammed Salem Basindwa gave in to the militants' demands for changes in the government and resigned Sunday, saying he did so for the best of Yemen. The car bomb is the second against Houthis this week. Fifteen Houthi fighters were killed and dozens injured when a vehicle exploded at a building used as a meeting place for Houthi supporters in the northern Saada province earlier in the week. The attack was the first such attack against Houthis in the province of Saada, home of their leader, Abdul Malik Al Houthi. The death toll from the government and Houthi clashes in Sanaa this month exceeds 350, according to two Ministry of Health officials. More than a thousand people were also injured. Though a ceasefire deal was signed, Houthis continued protesting in Sanaa with hundreds of their fighters still spread in checkpoints in the heart of Sanaa.","A bomb explodes near a Houthi-controlled hospital; at least seven people are killed .

"Cedar Rapids, Iowa (CNN) -- The Iowa caucuses are 16 months away, but judging from the way potential presidential candidates are visiting this state, you'd think they were next week. But White House hopefuls are taking advantage of the fact that next week is the first competitive Senate election here in decades. They're coming to campaign with the candidates early and often. Hillary Clinton's Wednesday with the Democratic Senate candidate Bruce Braley was about electing Bruce Braley. She talked almost exclusively about his bona fides, and the problems with his Republican opponent. But just the fact that she was here, helping her fellow Democrat, will score points with the local leaders and hard core party voters she will need to back her in 2016 -- especially since Iowa was the beginning of the end for her candidacy eight years ago when she came in third in the Iowa caucuses. Although this time around Clinton doesn't appear to have as much competition, other Democrats with 2016 buzz have been here too -- from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley to Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. On the much more wide open and chaotic GOP side, Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst can barely go a day without a White House hopeful next to her. The day we were with her it was Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who broke his own rule of not picking sides in GOP primaries to endorse Ernst early on, and he's been here several times since to campaign with her. ""How Iowa goes, the Senate will go. The Senate Majority may very well be decided here in Iowa this year,"" Rubio told us in an interview during one of his three campaign stops with Ernst. And though he too was careful to make his public remarks about the Senate race, helping Ernst win, pressing the flesh with Iowa voters who are used to getting to know their presidential candidates is undeniably helpful. Rubio said he has visited Iowa three or four times this midterm election year, (but who's counting) and he's hardly alone. Texas Gov. Rick Perry, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul have all made multiple visits to the Hawkeye state in 2014 alone. Even South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who said recently he might consider running for president, campaigned with Ernst last week despite the fact that he's on the ballot in his own state Tuesday. Paul had the good fortune of being chosen by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a powerful GOP force, to appear straight to camera in their new closing television ad here. ""If you're a freedom loving, liberty loving voter I urge you to get out and vote for Joni Ernst this Tuesday,"" Paul says in the ad. But sometimes testing the waters can be treacherous. Though Rubio received several warm greetings with not-so-veiled references to his presidential ambitions, one voter, Jan Larson, was looking for someone else -- and told him so. Larson stopped Rubio when he was working the crowd in Williamsburg, Iowa, to ask about Mitt Romney. ""Can we convince Mitt to run?"" Larson asked Rubio. ""I don't know you'll have to ask him,"" Rubio responded with a smile. ""I did,"" Larson said. CNNs Adam Levy contributed to this report.","White House hopefuls have spent recent weeks stumping for Iowa congressional candidates .

"(CNN) -- Muslim community leaders in Australia say sectarian tensions are soaring, as radicalized Sunni youth, inspired by ISIS, seek to import the religious conflicts wracking the Middle East. ""The tensions are very high and will continue to be high,"" said Jamal Daoud, a Shia community leader in Sydney, where a 47-year old Shia leader was shot in the shoulder early Monday morning, as worshipers observed the Shia ritual of Ashura. He said Rasoul Al Mousawi, a leader in the Shia community focused around the Islamic center in Greenacre, south-west Sydney, had been released from hospital on Tuesday and was doing well. The attack was only one incident in a string of attacks and threats against Shia Muslims by Sunni extremists who sympathized with ISIS, he claimed, and had followed an incident where a group of men had driven past the Islamic center, yelling comments such as ""IS lives forever"" and ""Shia dogs"" in Arabic. A security guard had also been attacked by a group of men who appeared to be followers of the austere Wahhabi tradition of Sunni Islam on Friday, he said. ""There's high tension between Sunni and Shia, but these extremists, they threaten and attack Sunnis too,"" he said. ""Anyone who speaks against the fighting in Syria and advocating the government to take action against people in Iraq and Syria -- they are threatened and attacked."" Jamal Rifi, a Sydney-based GP and Sunni community leader, agreed, saying sectarian tensions were at an unprecedented level as a result of the brutal Syrian conflict, and the appeal of ISIS to radicalized Sunni youth in Australia. ""This is the highest level I've ever seen, and it's been like this since Khaled Sharrouf got his son to hold up that severed head,"" he said, referring to the notorious Australian ISIS jihadist who tweeted a picture of his seven-year-old son posing with the body parts of a dead fighter in August. 'Death cult influence' On Tuesday, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told reporters that ""it seems there is an ISIL death cult influence on this shooting in Sydney,"" using an alternative name for the terror group. ""The important thing is for all of us to absolutely reject this death cult,"" he said. Some Australian media reports suggested a leadership dispute at the Islamic center could have been the reason behind the attack, but Daoud rejected the notion, saying the dispute was being litigated in the courts and it was highly unlikely that it would take a violent turn. A New South Wales police spokesman said there was nothing to add beyond the police's initial statement calling for public information on the shooting. Abbott's government has been a strident supporter of U.S. efforts to combat the Sunni extremist group, which controls large swathes of Syria and Iraq. It has deployed jets and military troops in the fight, introduced controversial legislation to imprison Australians found to be fighting abroad or supporting terrorist actions, and conducted large-scale anti-terror raids, claiming to have disrupted a plot to kidnap and behead a random member of the public. Authorities believe around 60 Australians are fighting in the conflict in Syria and Iraq, with around 100 more working in support roles within Australia. But Daoud said he was yet to see the fruits of Abbott's tough talk about reining in Australia's radicalized Muslim youth. ""We thought a lot of the radical Islamic centers would be closed, well-known extremists would be rounded up and put behind bars,"" he said. ""It's all talk."" Doubly under fire . Sectarian tensions were a new phenomenon for Australia's Muslim community, said Rifi. During previous periods when Australian Muslims had felt under attack -- such as in the wake of the September 11 attacks, the Bali bombings or the Cronulla riots -- they had bonded together under a common identity. But now many in the community felt doubly under fire -- from sectarian agitators and from ""rednecks"" in the wider public, said Daoud. Rifi said that from the early days of the Syrian conflict, Sunni extremists had inflamed community tensions by attempting to ""name and shame"" businesses on social media that were run by members of Alawite sect, to which Syrian President Bashar al-Assad belongs. ""They will use any excuse to create division,"" he said. Rifi said he remained optimistic. ""The forces that pull us apart are increasing in strength, but they are nowhere as strong as the forces that pull us together,"" he said. But Daoud did not believe things would improve soon. ""It is a very tough time, and we expect it to become more tough,"" he said.","Australian Muslim leaders say Sunni-Shia tensions are at a high .

"(CNN) -- ""Hong Kong enjoys a far higher degree of press freedom than before the handover in 1997 and this is on par with the most developed places in the world,"" said Hong Kong Secretary for Home Affairs, Tsang Tak-sing, to the Legislative Council last November. Tsang was urging council members to vote down a motion defending press freedom in the territory, put forth by the Democratic Party's Emily Lau amid growing concern about China's influence on Hong Kong's media. In fact, he sounded like a mainland official citing instances of 'good deeds' when rebutting criticism against China's human rights record. Such claims contrast sharply with the reality in Hong Kong, where the free flow and access to information has been gradually but steadily restricted following Hong Kong's return to Chinese sovereignty on July 1, 1997. Although freedom of the press is enshrined in Hong Kong's de facto constitution, the Basic Law, the gap has been shrinking between our city and mainland China, which does not enjoy freedom of expression. Hong Kong Special Administrative Region- Is it still special 15 years later? In Hong Kong, the proliferation of media outlets does not tell the whole story. The figures are robust: a city of seven million people consuming 46 daily newspapers and 642 periodicals as of 2010, according to the Hong Kong Yearbook. Nonetheless, the large number of media outlets does not ensure a diversity of voices, which is a fundamental part of press freedom. According to an industry survey conducted by the Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA) in April, nearly 87% of the 663 journalists who responded said press freedom in Hong Kong has deteriorated since 2005 when Donald Tsang took office as Chief Executive. This builds upon a similar survey conducted by the HKJA in 2007, in which 58.4% of journalists felt press freedom had been eroded since the 1997 handover. The results confirmed a worrying trend in the media industry. More than 92% of respondents in this latest survey found the government's tight grip on the flow of information has now surpassed self-censorship as the main mode of eroding press freedom. In many ways, the government now controls what information can be reported, and which images and soundbites can be used. The media have been blocked from many coverage opportunities and forced to rely more on official press materials. The government has increasingly resorted to holding press briefings, where information presented there may be attributed only to ""anonymous"" government sources. In one recent example, a population policy report was presented at a Rotary Club lunch by Chief Secretary Stephen Lam. A closed-door briefing was held, during which no audio or video recording was allowed. The full report was also not provided to the media, who were told to find it on the government's website. The tightening of information sources by the government has more significance in Hong Kong than elsewhere because there is not a multi-party system in place. The governing party is the only source of official information, and it allows only manipulated information to trickle out into the public domain. More worrying are the reports of rough treatment being meted out to reporters on the ground. At the July 1 march last year -- an annual display of public wrath against the destruction of democracy -- at least 19 frontline reporters were pepper-sprayed and one was unreasonably arrested. In August, media access to a three-day visit by Chinese vice-premier Li Keqiang was mostly denied, with the press area located far away from the official ceremony. There are also tight restrictions on movement in the vicinity of the new government offices in Tamar, making it impossible to freely conduct interviews. But what is more damaging for press freedom is the increased self-censorship among journalists. In the HKJA survey conducted in April, 79.2% of respondents said self-censorship now is more serious than at the start of Tsang's term in 2005. Many observers in Hong Kong claim Beijing's liaison office made tremendous efforts to help the new Chief-Executive Leung Chun-ying win his position in the April elections. Three days before the vote, the Sing Pao newspaper distorted the opinion column of veteran commentator, Johnny Lau, to support Leung's candidacy. Lau had rejected both candidates in his piece, which was altered without his consent to, ""Out of the two, I would rather choose Leung Chun-ying."" Sing Pao's editor-in-chief, Ng Kai-kong, admitted the alteration was made to conform with front-page coverage supporting Leung. Nonetheless, Lau's column was dropped completely from the paper shortly afterward, following a piece on the passing of mainland dissident Fang Lizhi in U.S. exile. The structural factors of journalistic self-censorship are reinforced when Hong Kong media outlets are owned by listed companies that have an eye on mainland China's enormous market. Over half of their owners and major stakeholders are appointed as delegates to the National People's Congress or members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. This conflict of interest leads to unfavorable coverage of the Chinese government being cut. Criticism of conglomerates that wield strong influence over advertising, and news detrimental to media owners' interests are downplayed. Last month, the English-language South China Morning Post's reduction of a 25-cm-long story to a mere 100-word brief on the questionable death of mainland dissident Li Wangyang on the day the story broke aroused allegations of self-censorship from both its employees and the media industry. The newly-promoted editor-in-chief, Wang Xiangwei, who is a member of the Jilin Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, provided a weak defence in an official statement, arguing that he ""chose not to prioritize coverage on the first day it broke until more facts and details surrounding the circumstances of this case could be established."" The SCMP only gave wider coverage to the incident after the local Chinese media gave it extensive coverage, and 25,000 people took to the streets to demand a thorough investigation into Li's death. It seems the newspaper does not want be seen as lagging behind the ethos of Hong Kong. Read about Hong Kong's mass protest on July 1 . Press freedom in Hong Kong is endangered and while efforts should start from us journalists, we need a collective effort to turn the tide. This latest controversy shows that mass social pressure may be an effective way to ward off self-censorship. The Chinese authorities could not immediately be reached for comment.

"(CNN) -- With his heroics at the U.S. Open in New York, Kei Nishikori has blazed a trail through history. Defying injury, an all-night marathon and several of the world's best tennis players, he became the first Asian man to reach a Grand Slam singles final. The 24-year-old dredged up a seismic shock to dispatch world No. 1 Novak Djokovic on Saturday and even though he lost to Marin Cilic in Monday's final, there's surely more to come from Nishikori. ""We have been waiting such a long time for a star like this so this is a very big moment,"" says Hitoshi Ko of Japan's Smash Tennis magazine. If this suggests Japanese tennis history adds up to a barren wasteland, it does not tell the full story. While the post-1968 Open Era has produced consistent under-performance, the Land of the Rising Sun once enjoyed a golden age. The boom was sparked by an expatriate elite that adopted the game, known as a sport for gentlemen, on their travels in the early 20th century, particularly in England. The aristocrats went on to establish clubs and tournaments back home. Participation and standards climbed, and Japanese players became a serious force during the interwar years. Among the finest of these, Zenzo Shimizu reached the Wimbledon ""All comers' final"" of 1920 -- a match that would decide who took on the defending champion for that year's title. In the prestigious grass-court tournament's original format, the titleholder had to play just once. Shimizu lost in three close sets to American Bill Tilden, who would go on to beat Australian Gerald Patterson for the first of 10 grand slam titles in an illustrious career, but he had made his mark as a rising star. The Japanese established a national association the same year, which allowed them to enter the 1921 Davis Cup with a formidable two-man team of Shimizu and Ichiya Kumagae, a banker by trade once described as the ""best player in America"" by the New York Times. He reached the semifinals of the 1918 U.S. Nationals and won silver medals in singles and doubles at the 1920 Olympics. The pair reeled off Davis Cup triumphs over Philippines, Belgium, India and Australia before eventually succumbing to the U.S. in the final. This remains Japan's best performance in the prestigious competition and was a source of great national pride. A Japan Times article praised the ""tennis marvels ... doing as much to put Japan right before the world as all the diplomats put together."" The pair continued to enjoy success and were joined by fresh talent. Jiro Sato soared in a run of five grand slam semifinals in a little over two years. He beat legends of the game Jack Crawford and Fred Perry and seemed set to claim a top title. But Sato's career ended tragically in 1934 when he leaped to his death from a ship after a Davis Cup defeat, leaving a note that expressed his shame. World War II marked the end of his nation's ascendancy, ushering in a fallow period that would endure to the present day. After Japan had recovered enough to contemplate sport, tennis remained popular with aristocrats -- including the royal family and Crown Prince Akihito -- but public interest slipped away toward baseball and football, and the talent production line ceased. Through the professional era, male Japanese players barely troubled the top 100, with Jun Kamiwazumi's third-round performance at the 1973 U.S. Open among the highlights. It was not until the 1990s heyday of Shuzo Matsuoka that any respectability was restored. That period also witnessed the rise of a women's star in Kimiko Date, who reached three grand slam semifinals and a high of fourth in the rankings before retiring. Since her comeback in 2008 she has added another WTA Tour title to her career haul, is the oldest player in the top 100 singles rankings and reached the women's doubles semis in New York just over three weeks away from her 44th birthday. Matsuoka never passed a grand slam quarterfinal, but his contribution is being felt now. Nishikori calls him ""the first"" successful Japanese men's player, the only role model on his route to the top. Passing his hero's ranking of 46 was Nishikori's driving motivation until he attained it. Now, having entered the top 10 in May and breaking new ground every season, he could be launching a new golden era. Sponsors, publicity and funding have poured into the game off the back of Nishikori's efforts. Public interest and attendances surged last year after he became the first home champion of the Japan Open since 1972 -- he won the title in October 2012 -- and peaked again this week due to his New York success. Not that Nishikori gets to see much of that, since he lives in Florida. Seven Japanese players are ranked in the men's top 200 -- a record in the Open era -- though Nishikori is the only one in the top 100. However, journalist Ko is not yet convinced the structure is in place for Japan to become an elite tennis nation. ""Kei grew up practicing at the (Nick Bollettieri) academy in Florida,"" he said. ""I think we still don't have enough players or quality coaches. Maybe more players should learn abroad."" Ko has no doubt that Nishikori's run in New York represents Japan's greatest moment in tennis and one of its greatest in any sport. The jubilation sweeping the country suggests he is right. At last, Soto and Shimizu have an heir to fulfil the nation's dreams.","Kei Nishikori will play in his first grand slam inal at the U.S. Open on Monday .

"(CNN) -- Over the last two years, AMC's ""The Walking Dead"" has become one of the most popular dramatic series on television due in large part to complex story lines involving morality, survival and human relationships in a post-apocalyptic world. It's also popular because of the fantastic-looking zombies that terrorize the characters each week, thrusting the decision-making process into a very primal, fight-or-flight mentality. Longtime special effects guru/director Greg Nicotero is the man behind the zombies and has worked on the series since Day One, where he's now a co-executive producer. He got his start in the horror business in the mid-'80s on George Romero's ""Day of the Dead"" and has since branched out into many other film genres. But a television series such as ""The Walking Dead"" is a bit different than film work and presents a new set of challenges. ""I have 25 years' experience in the genre, so I know what's been done before,"" he says. ""A lot of the gags we come up with (on 'The Walking Dead') are gags that are developed because I've seen every zombie movie ever made."" CNN spoke with Nicotero from the set of ""The Walking Dead"" in Senoia, Georgia, about the show's popularity, the changing nature of zombie aesthetics and emotional attachment to the undead. (The third season of ""The Walking Dead"" premieres at 9 p.m. ET Sunday on AMC.) Post-apocalyptic TV is everywhere . CNN: As someone with such an extensive resume in horror films, what about ""The Walking Dead"" makes it so popular? Greg Nicotero: There (are) three really key aspects of the show. I've done a lot of zombie shows and it's really a delicate balance to have great monsters, great characters and great story. (If) it's too much of one and not enough of the other, it sort of explodes in your face. We really make a concerted effort to make sure everything is balanced, everything is grounded. CNN: What does it take to make one ""Walking Dead"" zombie? Nicotero: I have a team of four permanent makeup artists. We've gotten to a point where we're averaging about an hour and a half per character. The extras come into the trailers; we don't know who is coming in, and it's sort of like having a new canvas every single time. They all have contact lenses; they all have custom dentures; some people we like to make more rotted than others. It all depends on the character and what we want to do on that particular day. Some days, where we only have six or seven walkers, we're able to take a little bit more time with them, make them particularly decomposed-looking. Days that we have 60 or 70, we break it down where we have ""hero"" makeups, which are features, and ""midground"" makeups, which are paint jobs, where we paint highlights and shadows on their faces to make them look dead, but they're not intended to get too close to the camera. And we have ""deep background."" At the beginning of each season, we have what we call ""Zombie School,"" and what that does is give me an opportunity to audition anywhere from 150 to 200 extras. I grade them on two criteria: Look and performance. We have a visual aesthetic that is really important to the show and the zombies, that they look thin and gaunt and emaciated. We tend to go with thinner people who have a specific kind of bone structure, so when we put prosthetic on them, because makeup is an additive process, it doesn't look like we're building out their face too much. The second part of it is performance. The actor has to bring it to life. It's very important that our walkers are genuine and authentic. CNN: Has the zombie aesthetic evolved over the course of three seasons? Do you play around with that stuff? Nicotero: Oh yeah, all the time. When we did season one, when it was over, I sat down and made a list of what I thought worked successfully in season one and what I thought we could refine. Season two came up, and we had refined the look of the zombies, the design of the contact lenses, design of the dentures. It's the same with season three. This season, we've used a lot of animatronic puppets, we've used practical gags to accent the zombie kills. Every time I watch an episode, I'm always thinking about how we can refine it, how it can be better. CNN: There's a scene in season two where the young girl Sophia emerges as a zombie from the barn. What are some of the conversations (you) had when crafting a zombie character that has such an emotional attachment to the group? Nicotero: It's challenging, from an emotional standpoint and a story content point. ... She needed to be recognizable; she needed to be empathetic-looking. That's one of the things we've been able to impart on our zombies that hasn't really been done in any other show. You look at some of these zombies and you feel an emotion for them; you feel compassion or sadness. They're not just flesh-eating monsters; (they) are a symbol of ""what we once were."" With (Sophia), it was critical that she wasn't horribly disfigured. We had done a face cast of her and done a bunch of test makeups on her. We really wanted to be able to ""keep her."" CNN: How much does technology factor into your work these days? Nicotero: If you look at the original ""Dawn of the Dead,"" those gags were all done practical; there were no CGI (computer-generated imagery) effects back then. That movie was the benchmark for years for zombie effects. ... Things like shooting zombies in the head, in the old days, that would have been done practical with squibs. Nowadays, if you have Rick Grimes (played by Andrew Lincoln) running down the street, and he has to shoot six zombies, it's not practical to do a head hit on all six of those zombies and do it in a big wide shot. So digital technology allows us in the edit, once the shot is cut together, to determine which zombies we want to accentuate with a head hit on them. For me, what's important is to constantly keep the audience guessing. The minute the audience thinks they know how you did it, then you got to switch it up.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- One of the suspects in a California shooting spree that left two sheriff's deputies dead was deported to Mexico twice, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Authorities say Marcelo Marquez, 34, of Salt Lake City, Utah, was arrested Friday after police found him in a home in Auburn, about 30 miles from the initial shooting. Also arrested was Jannelle Monroy, 38, of Sacramento County, who was allegedly with Marquez during the rampage, authorities said. The rampage began in the parking lot of a $56-a-night motel outside downtown Sacramento when two sheriff's deputies checked on a suspicious car there. Authorities said by the time the spree was over on Friday, the suspects had killed two sheriff's deputies in two counties, wounded a third deputy, attempted three car carjackings and shot a driver in the head -- all during a span of six hours. Those events prompted a handful of school lockdowns and a massive manhunt. Reconstructing shooting-carjack spree that left 2 Calif. deputies dead . Virginia Kice, a spokeswoman for ICE, says that Marcelo Marquez is actually an alias for a man named Luis Enrique Monroy-Bracamonte. He was removed from the U.S. twice, the first time in 1997 after an arrest and conviction in Arizona for narcotics possession. He was arrested and sent back to Mexico again in 2001. Sacramento County Deputy Danny Oliver, 47, was killed in the spree. The 15-year veteran was a husband and father of two daughters. The other slain officer was Placer County Deputy Michael David Davis Jr., 42, an 18-year veteran with a wife and four children. Davis died exactly 26 years after his father, a Riverside County sheriff's deputy, was killed in the line of duty, authorities said. The wounded deputy, Jeff Davis of Placer County, was shot in the arm. He was later treated and released. The driver who was shot in the head is 38-year-old Anthony Holmes. He is in serious condition in a hospital, according to authorities and CNN affiliates.","One of the suspect in a California shooting spree was previously deported, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

"Washington (CNN) -- As soon as Air Force One touched down in Indiana on Friday, Gov. Mike Pence met President Barack Obama on the tarmac with a plea: Expand the state's access to government-sponsored health insurance. The catch: Pence wants to do it with a conservative twist. At least, that's how he's selling his proposal. And his political future could hinge on whether the first-term Republican can convince conservatives that he's not just rebranding Obamacare. Pence has spent much of his first two years in office trying to strike a bargain on one of the health care law's core components. Indiana will expand Medicaid coverage, Pence says, but only if it's allowed to do it through a tweaked version called the ""Healthy Indiana Plan,"" which also requires users to make small payments into health savings accounts. He spent five minutes chatting with Obama at the Evansville airport, lobbying to have the Health and Human Services Department green-light Indiana's request, before the president visited a factory in Princeton, Indiana. ""The president and I talked through a number of substantive issues that have arisen in our discussions over the Healthy Indiana Plan,"" Pence said afterward, ""and I appreciated the opportunity to call the matter to his personal attention."" He said he also spoke last night with top Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett, and will meet Monday with HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell. Pence's focus on a health care expansion is at the center of his effort to evolve from a firebrand conservative congressman to an executive with a record of accomplishment ahead of a White House run that many Republicans close to him see as a question of when -- not if. As he flirts with a 2016 bid, Pence could be the best test of whether a conservative can run nationally after expanding a government-sponsored health system. Mitt Romney faced hurdles with conservatives during his 2012 presidential bid, in part because of the health care system he put in place when he was the governor of Massachusetts. Other governors who could seek the 2016 GOP nomination -- including New Jersey's Chris Christie and Ohio's John Kasich -- have accepted Obamacare's extension of Medicaid coverage to hundreds of thousands of their state's residents. But Pence has taken an important extra step. He's arguing that Indiana's proposal is the solution to Medicaid's woes. He called Indiana's plan ""a better and more effective alternative"" to traditional Medicaid in a letter to Obama on Thursday. The Healthy Indiana Plan's key departure from traditional Medicaid is that users are required to contribute small amounts of their own money to personal health savings accounts. The program was developed under former Gov. Mitch Daniels and initially served about 40,000 adults under a Medicaid waiver that HHS granted before Obamacare's existence. After Pence was elected in 2012, he said a slightly updated version called the ""Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0"" is the only vehicle he'd consider for expanding coverage. ""Since its inception, the Healthy Indiana Plan has empowered its members to take greater personal ownership over their health care decisions and become more cost-conscious consumers of health care services,"" Pence wrote to Obama on Thursday. But some conservatives say Indiana's changes to Medicaid are just ""window dressing."" ""It seems like he's just sort of taken the moniker of health savings accounts and applied it to this brand new entitlement in hoping that this window dressing will make it conservative,"" said Jonathan Ingram, the research director for the Foundation for Government Accountability, which has set up a website -- StopPence.com -- blasting Pence's handling of the issue. Even Pence's usually-reliable allies have been critical. Chase Downham, Americans for Prosperity's Indiana state director, called it a ""troubling deviation from the solid, free-market approach Gov. Pence has taken on most other matters,"" and said he hopes Pence is firm with Obama to keep from giving ""any ground which would result in Hoosier taxpayers paying even more."" The criticism comes as Pence is increasingly hyped as a prospective nominee who both the GOP's base and its business wing could find acceptable. A 2016 run is no lock, and Pence has said he'll make a decision about his future next year -- likely after the Indiana legislature wraps up its budget-writing session in April. But he's been testing the waters. Pence visited Iowa last month and will campaign in New Hampshire for Gov. Walt Havenstein on Oct. 24. He critiqued Obama's handling of foreign policy during a trip to Germany over the summer. And two of his former top aides, Marc Short and Matt Lloyd, now work within the network of conservative funding giants Charles and David Koch -- a sign that Pence would have the financial backing for a national run. Ingram said his group polled three early primary states -- Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina -- in August, and found that 70 percent of likely GOP primary voters said they wouldn't support a candidate who had expanded Medicaid. ""The idea that a Republican governor can come in and implement Obamacare and then run for president unscathed -- it seems a little ridiculous,"" he said.","Mike Pence urged President Obama to OK Indiana's proposal to expand health coverage .

"Washington (CNN) -- Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan once fretted that she ""may have really f---ed up"" after a miscommunication with other aides about a segment on the CNN show ""Crossfire."" Her comments were in a note to her boss, White House Counsel Jack Quinn, that was among the nearly 10,000 documents released Friday by the Clinton Presidential Library. Kagan, an associate counsel in the Clinton White House whom President Barack Obama later nominated to the Supreme Court, was explaining to Quinn a ""right-hand-left-hand"" communication problem as aides prepared for media appearances amid Paula Jones' sexual harassment allegations. ""God, do I feel like an idiot,"" Kagan said. Clinton documents show 'West Wing' mindset . In another document released Friday, Kagan offered an interesting recommendation for who should defend Clinton against Jones' sexual harassment accusations at the Supreme Court: John Roberts. A handwritten note lists Roberts with the word ""Hogan"" underneath his name -- a reference to the law firm now called Hogan Lovells, where he then worked. Another page lists Roberts' name again, this time with some biographical details. Kagan and Roberts now serve on the Supreme Court together. Roberts never worked on the Jones case. June: More Clinton documents released: Here are the highlights . The documents released Friday cover the entire Clinton presidency from 1993-2001 and are the last batch of documents released by the library under the Presidential Records Act. The act says the documents must be made available to the public 12 years after the end of a president's administration. The Clinton Library began releasing the documents in batches starting in February. Here are four other interesting tidbits disclosed in Friday's release: . - In a January 1993 meeting with Clinton six days after his inauguration, members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff voiced opposition to gays serving openly in the military. Marine Corps Gen. Carl Mundy says those who admit to being gay or who associate with Gay Pride ""will have a negative effect"" and that it ""fractures teamwork."" For a person to ""proclaim: I'm gay"" is the ""same as I'm KKK, Nazi, rapist,"" Mundy says. Apparently Vice President Al Gore didn't like Mundy's comments; the notes indicate he called them ""borderline."" Clinton tells the military chiefs that the whole issue causes him ""great discom(fort)"" as he wrestles with the idea of gay men and women who are patriotic and devoted to the armed forces but unable to serve because they declare they are gay. Later in the meeting, he says the ""people I would like to keep (in the military) wouldn't show up at (a) Queer Nation parade."" - Keith Olbermann, then in his first run as an MSNBC host, sent Clinton a letter apologizing for the network's coverage of the Monica Lewinsky scandal and for ""whatever part I may have played in perpetuating this ceaseless coverage."" Olbermann added that he had a career change in the works, writing, ""I'll be headed back to my previous career in sports as quickly as possible."" Clinton aide R. Scott Michaud said he planned to flag the letter for the president to see, and also asked if it'd be OK to send Olbermann a generic response. - Jennifer Palmieri, who is now President Barack Obama's communications director, makes an appearance when she receives an explanation for how to open an email attachment. ""It can be accessed by hitting 'launch,'"" she is advised. - Mike Huckabee, who was then the governor of Arkansas, needed a ""warm response"" to his letter to Clinton declaring May 8, 1999, as ""Safe Television for All Ages Day"" in his state and asking the president to make it a national proclamation. A White House aide noted atop the letter that Huckabee ""hates"" Clinton and was planning to run against Democratic Sen. Blanche Lincoln. ""He needs a quick/warm response,"" the note says.

"(CNN) -- Shia LaBeouf can sum up his turbulent year in two words: ""existential crisis."" That's how the 28-year-old actor, who'll next star alongside Brad Pitt in October 17's ""Fury,"" described his recent behavior on Ellen DeGeneres' talk show Friday. DeGeneres, always the gracious host, kindly asked LaBeouf to explain just what's been going on with him since the start of 2014. He's gone from skywriting an apology for plagiarism to wearing a bag over his head to being arrested for an outburst during a Broadway production. ""I went through like an existential crisis, which turned into an exploration, really,"" LaBeouf told DeGeneres. ""I had some hiccups, some judgment error."" So when he hosted a performance art installation called ""#IAmSorry"" earlier this year, the actor said that was a genuine attempt to apologize to the public. ""There was a lot of negativity online, so I thought, alright, let's see what this negativity is about. Let's invite it in,"" LaBeouf said. ""I was really, truly apologetic ... I was sort of apologizing to the public in a way. I thought for sure people were going to come in there and be super mean, but it wasn't that way at all. It was very human. Once they got in there everything changed, they stopped looking at me like an object they started looking at me like a human. They were very loving."" That loving experience didn't automatically put LaBeouf back on the right path. In June, he was charged with disorderly conduct, harassment and criminal trespass after being accused of drunken and disruptive behavior in a Broadway venue. (The charges were later settled with the agreement being that LaBeouf would continue seeking treatment for alcohol addiction.) The time he spent in jail for that incident was enough to get him to rethink his actions. It wasn't the first time he'd been in lockup, but it was ""the worst time,"" probably because he did spit on a cop, as he told DeGeneres. ""Jail is quite scary. I was there for what felt like forever -- 24 hours or 25 hours. ... It was really rough,"" he said. Not to mention the actor also got a good earful from his mother, whom he's very close to. When he's not behaving as well as he could, he'll get a phone call in which he'll bluntly be told, ""Stop f*****g around."" May be brusque, but it works: ""Now I'm on the right path,"" LaBeouf said.

"ABIDJAN, Cote d'Ivoire (Reuters) -- The United Nations said on Saturday it had suspended a Moroccan military contingent from its peacekeeping mission in Cote d'Ivoire while it investigated allegations of widespread sexual abuse. Moroccan U.N. peacekeepers stop a bus near Bouake, Cote d'Ivoire, in March. ""It means they don't participate in our operations,"" said Hamadoun Toure, spokesman for the U.N. mission in Cote d'Ivoire (ONUCI). ""Those who are found guilty will be sent back home."" The world body said the measure was in addition to a decision to confine the entire battalion of 734 soldiers to barracks. U.N. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Friday the investigation involved Moroccan soldiers having sex with a large number of underage girls in the West African country's northern rebel stronghold of Bouake. Toure said the allegations had come to light after the mission ran a campaign against sexual exploitation in which it asked local people to inform it about abuses. It then sent a team to carry out interviews and gather information. The Cote d'Ivoire mission numbers just over 9,000 uniformed personnel from more than 40 countries. Moroccans make up the bulk of the force in Bouake with some Bangladeshi police, Pakistani engineers and Ghanaian medical personnel. The peacekeepers, backed by troops from former colonial power France, are in the world's top cocoa grower to support a peace process that was revived in March by an agreement between President Laurent Gbagbo and rebel leader Guillaume Soro.

"(CNN) -- As a teenager, Omer Kiyani was shot in the face with an unsecured firearm. He still struggles with the trauma. But the Detroit engineer now believes he has created a device that would have saved him and may save thousands of others. He calls it ""Identilock,"" and while it still needs final adjustments to the prototype and further investment, Kiyani expects to launch his smart gun technology in U.S. stores within a year, retailing for around $300. The device attaches to the trigger of a handgun, which can then only be unlocked by biometric authentication, preventing any unauthorized user from firing the weapon. Drawing on breakthroughs in mobile technology, the trigger is released by similar fingerprint sensors to those used in Apple's iPhone 5S. Those sensors are approved by the FBI, and widely found in security scanners. ""The key is reliability,"" says Kiyani. ""The sensor has proved itself in different sectors over the past few years and the market is aware of its capability."" The gun is enabled in under a second from first contact, and engineers are chipping away to further reduce the time. Eventually, it is hoped the lock will be integrated and the release will be instant. ""The main point of firearms ownership is home defense, and home defense means quick access,"" says Kiyani. ""But the other side of that is accidents."" The inventor believes his experience indicates an urgent and avoidable crisis and the statistics support him. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2010, 62 children aged one to 14 were killed in firearm accidents in the United States, and 785 from 1999 to 2010 -- far higher death tolls than school shootings over the same period. Kiyani is not interested in politics and keeps his vision simple. ""I'm a gun victim, a gun owner, and I have children. I came up with something that fits my needs. ""I was working as a safety engineer for airbag calibration, and it didn't make sense that there was something so simple that had such an impact on safety, but not for guns. In essence, this is a product of that question."" Surge of innovation . Even if all goes to plan, Kiyani's will not be the first smart gun system to hit the U.S. market. In February, German firm Armatix launched its iP1 pistol that uses a radio frequency identification (RFID) chip activated by the owner's watch, and the competition is growing. Directives from the White House to promote development of safety technology in the wake of school shootings have led to a surge of innovation. There is now an increased appetite and funding for a field that had stalled since the earlier designs in the 1970s. The boldest statement is an open challenge from The Smart Tech Foundation. It was created by Silicon Valley angel investor Ron Conway and serial entrepreneur Jim Pitkow in response to the Sandy Hook shootings and is making $1 million in prizes available for development of the best ideas. The Foundation claims to have received over 200 entrants after the first month of the submission period, everything from concept stage to working prototype. Designs include electronic ammunition, remote controls and RFID chips buried in the owner's skin. Researchers at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) have been developing biometric designs since 1999. The leader of that program, Donald Sebastian, has seen many false dawns but is more confident than ever. ""The difference now to a decade ago is that there are more types of technology and they are all much better. Biometric technology failed one time out of four then, now we aim for one in 10,000 failure rates"", says Sebastian. ""The reliability of the safety needs to exceed that of the underlying firing mechanism, so there is never a discussion that the gun wouldn't work because of the technology."" 'Production ready' Sebastian's view is borne out by 2013 research into gun safety technology from the National Institute of Justice (NIJ). The report tested reliability in a range of RFID and biometric designs against existing firearms, and gave several ratings of ""Advanced Prototype or Production-Ready."" ""It is only recently that viable product designs have reached a commercializable or production-ready level of maturity,"" the report stated. NJIT remains at the vanguard, working with ""Dynamic Grip Recognition,"" perhaps the most ambitious system in development. The design uses a battery of sensors to build a ""movie"" of the user, learning the size and weight of their grip, and even their tics and manner with the gun to be sure of authorizing the correct user. As sensor technology continues to improve, the scope for progress is exponential, says Sebastian. A new prototype will be unveiled in June, promising to improve speed and accuracy, using an enhanced microprocessor that draws less power and needs less space. This design is the result of collaboration with military partners Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey. Beyond their technical expertise, Sebastian recognizes what military involvement could do for public acceptance ahead of a commercial launch and manufacturing. ""The technology we have developed is primarily for the civilian population, but to gain traction in those communities it needs to be used and endorsed by icons of gun ownership such as police and military,"" says Sebastian. With the phenomenon of ""Green on Blue"" attacks in Afghanistan (supposed allies carried out dozens of attacks on Coalition forces in 2012) there is mutual interest, says security technologist Kevin G. Coleman: ""Re-use of soldier's weapons is a hot issue and the army are concerned. But taking responsibility if (smart technology) goes wrong is a massive step. I could imagine use in non-critical settings in the near-term future -- the next three to five years -- and then a long period to see if people are comfortable with it."" Opposition . The size of the civilian market is unclear. NJIT research found that 72% of New Jersey gun owners supported the development of smart technology, and that parents could be a fruitful market. But a recent poll from the National Shooting Sports Foundation found that just 14% of Americans are likely to buy a smart gun, and the majority believe they are unreliable. Many gun rights advocates are hostile to the concept, arguing it is a ploy for gun control and is against the Second Amendment. Some gun advocates also argue that the electronics could be hacked by criminals. Opposition to Armatix's launch has reportedly been strong enough that it forced the vendor to withdraw its products. The California store which announced it would be selling Armatix products swiftly distanced itself from them following a severe backlash from gun rights activists. The major gun manufacturers have also been wary. Sebastian works with major gun manufacturers and believes their reluctance stems partly from fears that once the first smart guns are established, the technology will become mandatory. He sympathizes: ""It would be better if the transformation came through market demand rather than regulatory pressure."" Such fears may be justified. In 2002, New Jersey became the first U.S. state to legislate that new guns must be personalized within three years of the technology becoming available. The idea is also gaining currency across Europe. Should such mandates be enacted, or if the new designs find a strong market, the drip-drip of smart gun innovation may well become a flood.

"(CNN) -- TV actor Dimitri Diatchenko is accused of killing his ex-girlfriend's pet rabbit -- and then eating half of it. He then allegedly threatened to do the same to her, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office said in a statement Wednesday. Diatchenko, who appeared in episodes of ""Sons of Anarchy,"" reportedly made quite a show of the butchery, sending his ex-girlfriend blow-by-blow photos of what he was doing, according to authorities. The actor told a reporter from CNN affiliate KCAL in a phone interview that it was a hoax, that he didn't really eat the pet. ""This is all a misunderstanding. We got into an argument, but I didn't kill the bunny,"" Diatchenko said. Instead, he turned the rabbit loose, he told KCAL, and purchased rabbit meat to make her think it was the pet he had eaten. DA's statement . Diatchenko and his ex-girlfriend had been living together ""for some time"" after the end of their romantic relationship, the statement said. Diatchenko, 46, allegedly turned on the rabbit after the woman said they should no longer be roommates, the statement said. The ex-girlfriend wasn't identified by prosecutors. The grisly act happened on Sunday, when the rabbit's owner was out of the North Hollywood house, prosecutors said. ""Diatchenko skinned the pet, cooked it and ate half of it while sending her step-by-step pictures of what he did,"" the district attorney's statement said. ""When she returned, the defendant allegedly told her he would do the same to her."" The actor has been charged and is facing felony counts of cruelty to an animal with a use of knife allegation and criminal threats. If convicted, he faces a potential maximum sentence of four years and eight months in prison. Diatchenko, who has also appeared in episodes of ""Bones"" and ""How I Met Your Mother,"" is scheduled to be arraigned on December 30. Prosecutors said they plan to ask for bail to be set at $90,000. The case, which police are still investigating, evoked memories of a scene from the 1980s movie ""Fatal Attraction,"" in which the character played by Glenn Close boils the pet rabbit belonging to the family of her ex-lover.

"(CNN) -- Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said al Qaeda will fail if it seeks to spread its terror network into his country because Muslims there ""will die for India."" Al Qaeda announced plans this month to launch a new branch in the Indian subcontinent, in a video message featuring al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. Al-Zawahiri said that his group would seek support in the Indian states of Assam and Gujarat, and in Kashmir, the disputed region between India and Pakistan -- and that he wants to free Muslims from the ""oppression"" they face there. But in an exclusive interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria, Modi insisted that any such efforts would not succeed. ""My understanding is that they are doing injustice towards the Muslims of our country,"" he said. ""If anyone thinks Indian Muslims will dance to their tune, they are delusional.

Asked why so few among India's roughly 170 million Muslims have joined al Qaeda's ranks, Modi suggested the issue was one of a wider fight for principles, rather than a question of nationality. ""This is a crisis against humanity, not a crisis against one country or one race. So we have to frame this as a fight between humanity and inhumanity. Nothing else."" India, a predominantly Hindu nation, has a 13% Muslim population, according to the country's census. Inter-religious relations have become tense before. In 2002, Gujarat was wracked with anti-Muslim violence, in which more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed. Most of the world's Muslims live in Asia, with about 1 billion in the Asia-Pacific region and about 322 million in the Middle East and North Africa, according to the Pew Research Center. Besides Assam, Gujarat and Kashmir, al-Zawahiri also said in his message that he would seek to gain support ""for the vulnerable"" in Myanmar and Bangladesh. Peter Bergen, CNN's national security analyst, called the video ""hyperventilation and posturing."" ""It's al-Zawahiri's obvious way of getting some of the limelight back,"" he said, as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has moved front and center.

"(CNN) -- Up to three Ebola-infected travelers might board an international flight each month in West Africa, according to a new study, and potentially spread the deadly virus to other countries. Scientists used a model to predict that, on average, three people who are infected with Ebola will leave Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone in each of the coming months to fly to another country. They based their model on scheduled flights for September 1 to December 31, 2014, historic flight itineraries from 2013, and Ebola surveillance numbers from the current outbreak. The results were published in The Lancet this week. ""We understand there could be global risks associated with the current outbreak,"" said study author Dr. Isaac Bogoch, a specialist in infectious diseases and tropical medicine at the University of Toronto. ""We wanted to understand what those risks were."" Three passengers per month, or 2.8 to be exact, was around what Bogoch was expecting. Considering the number of people living in these West African countries, he says, the prevalence of the disease is still relatively low. Guinea, for example, has around 11.4 million people, and just over 1,500 recorded cases of Ebola. Nonessential travel to and from these countries has also been reduced significantly over the past six months. Of the approximately 500,000 travelers who flew out of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in 2013, more than half flew to one of five countries: Ghana, Senegal, the United Kingdom, France and Gambia. In fact, the study authors say the likelihood of someone traveling to the United Kingdom or France with Ebola is about eight times higher than the likelihood of someone traveling to the United States with the disease. Of course, Ebola has already come to the United States. The study authors note that the majority of people flying out of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are traveling to other low- or middle-income countries. As one hospital in the United States has had some trouble preventing transmission, experts question whether less-equipped nations will be able to stop the virus. ""If you look at how challenged the U.S. has been in dealing with this one imported case, I think it's really important for WHO and other countries to up the preparedness in areas where they might have less resources,"" said Dr. Jesse Goodman, professor of medicine and infectious diseases at Georgetown University, who was not involved with the study. The researchers also looked at the effectiveness of airport screenings in stopping the spread of the Ebola virus. Overall, they concluded that exit screening is more effective than screening passengers for Ebola when they arrive in another country. Exit screening at three airports is easier, Bogoch says, and requires fewer resources than doing entry screening at hundreds of airports around the globe. But even exit screening, he says, is unlikely to have much effect because of the virus' long incubation period. Someone can be infected with Ebola for up to 21 days before becoming symptomatic. That's how Thomas Eric Duncan made it to the United States with the virus; his temperature was taken before he boarded, but his symptoms didn't start until several days after his flight landed. Airport screenings are ""a control measure, but an imperfect control measure,"" says Dr. William Schaffner, an expert on infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University. Schaffner compares it to making fresh-squeezed juice: Airport screenings, from a fundamental public health point of view, he says, are ""very much squeeze with very little juice."" The bottom line is that the vast majority of our resources, Bogoch said, should be focused on preventing the spread of infection in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. ""If there are fewer cases in West Africa, fewer (infected) people will be boarding planes to other parts of the world,"" he says. ""That said, we still have to be prepared elsewhere. Because we know from experience that it can land on our doorstep.""","Scientists use model to predict number of Ebola-infected travelers leaving West Africa .

"(CNN) -- Katy Perry is football's newest favorite pop star. After attending her first college football game on October 4 (Ole Miss vs. Alabama), appearing on ESPN's ""College GameDay"" and sending a flirtatious message to Oklahoma Sooners quarterback Trevor Knight, pretty much the only thing left for Perry to do is take the field herself. According to reports, Perry will come close to doing just that as the star of 2015's Super Bowl halftime show. Katy Perry reportedly to perform at Super Bowl XLIX halftime . Neither Perry nor the NFL has commented on the speculation, and the singer herself seemed to downplay the idea during her appearance on ""College GameDay."" ""I'm not the kind of girl who would pay to play the Super Bowl,"" Perry said, referring to an August Wall Street Journal report suggesting that Perry, Rihanna and Coldplay were three of the acts in consideration for the opportunity but that the NFL was requesting they pay to take the stage. The Journal noted that the request was met with a ""chilly"" response, as indicated by Perry's comment last week. But by Friday, it seems someone's tune changed, with the New York Post's Page Six and Billboard reporting that Perry is preparing to shine at Super Bowl XLIX, set for February 1 in Glendale, Arizona. It's not hard to see why the NFL would want to pursue Perry; if her much-talked-about performance happens, these are three reasons why we think she'd kill it. 1. She's got energetic, exuberant pop. Katy Perry's music is essentially the stuff Super Bowl halftime dreams are made of. Much of her catalog is high-energy, danceable pop that's just cheeky enough to be entertaining without losing a sponsorship. And she has a backlog of hits to choose from: There's ""Birthday"" and ""Roar"" from her 2013 release ""Prism,"" plus older but still-in-rotation tracks like ""Firework,"" ""Peacock,"" ""California Gurls"" and ""I Kissed A Girl."" 2. Everyone from your grandma to your 3-year-old nephew knows her music. In 2011, Katy Perry tied with Michael Jackson -- not bad company -- with five No. 1 singles from the same album. You don't accomplish that without some serious fan power, young and old. And when we say young, we mean young: ""Dark Horse"" has been known to soothe at least one baby. 3. She gives a show-stopping performance. One of the things critics took away from Perry's 2012 concert documentary, ""Part of Me,"" is that just much work goes into a Perry performance. From the costumes to the set pieces, Perry creates her own whimsical wonderland -- as anyone who's seen one of her videos can attest. We can only imagine the kind of creation that would accompany a Super Bowl halftime show.","Katy Perry is reportedly performing at the 2015 Super Bowl halftime show .

"(CNN)  -- Rowaida Abdelaziz doesn't want your pity. Rowaida Abdelaziz says wearing the hijab sometimes interferes with usual U.S. teenager activities, but that it's worth it to her faith. She doesn't want your frosty public stares; the whispers behind her back; the lament that she's been degraded by her father. What the Muslim high school senior wants you to understand is that she doesn't wear the hijab, the head scarf worn by Muslim women, because she is submissive. ""It represents beauty to me,"" says Abdelaziz, the 17-year-old daughter of two Egyptian parents living in Old Bridge, New Jersey. ""My mom says a girl is like a jewel,"" Abdelaziz says. ""When you have something precious, you usually hide it. You want to make sure you keep it safe until that treasure is ready to be found."" The nation has heard plenty of debate over racial profiling. But there's a form of religious profiling that some young Muslim women in America say they endure whenever they voluntarily wear the hijab. The hijab, also known as the veil, is the headscarf worn by Muslim women around the globe. It's a simple piece of cloth, but it can place young Muslim women in Western countries in difficult situations. Some hijab-wearers say that strangers treat them as if they're terrorists. Others ask them if they're a nun -- or even allergic to the sun. In some cases, their worst critics are not Americans, but fellow Muslim Americans. The pressure on Muslim teenagers in the U.S. who wear the hijab may be even more acute. Their challenge: How do I fit in when I wear something that makes me stand out? Randa Abdel-Fattah, who has written two novels about this question, says wearing the hijab can ""exhaust"" some young Muslim women in the West. ""You can sometimes feel like you're in a zoo: locked in the cage of other people's stereotypes, prejudices and judgments, on parade to be analyzed, deconstructed and reconstructed,"" says Abdel-Fattah, a Muslim who has Palestinian and Egyptian parents but was born in Australia. Abdel-Fattah says people should not assume that Muslim women who wear the hijab are being controlled by men. She, too, struggled with the choice of wearing a hijab when she was a teenager. ""When it comes to the hijab -- why to wear it, whether to wear it, how to wear it -- there is theology and then there is practice and there is huge diversity in both,"" says Abdel-Fattah, author of ""Does My Head Look Big in This?"" The surprising history behind the hijab . Some women say the hijab makes them feel like they're locked in a cage. But others say it leads to personal freedom. Sarah Hekmati first wore the hijab at age 15 growing up in Detroit, Michigan. She is the daughter of Iranian parents who left Iran in 1979 during the Islamic revolution. Hekmati says the hijab liberated her from some teenage angst: Does my hair look good? Am I cute enough? Should I lose weight? ""It gave me a sense of identity,"" she says. ""I really liked the purpose behind the hijab -- a woman covering herself so that a man should know her for her mind, not her body."" That purpose can be traced back to the Quran, Islam's holy text, which encourages women to dress modestly, says Faegheh Shirazi, author of ""The Veil Unveiled."" Some Muslims take the Quran's advice as a command for women to wear the hijab, while others disagree, she says. ""The Quran is very ambiguous about whether you have to wear the veil or not,"" Shirazi says. The hijab, however, actually predates Islam, Shirazi explains. The first known reference to veiling (Shirazi uses the term hijab and veil interchangeably) was made in an Assyrian legal text in the 13th century B.C., Shirazi says. In the Assyrian, and later, the Roman and Byzantine empires, the veil was a symbol of prestige and status, she says. By the 12th century, the veil had been imposed on women in the Muslim world to exclude them from public life, Shirazi says. ""A sign of distinction had been transformed into a sign of exclusion,"" she writes in her book. People are still debating the meaning of the hijab today. In 2007, British Muslim groups protested when schools were given the right to ban students from wearing full-face veils. In 2008, Turkey's top court upheld a ban on wearing Muslim headscarves at the country's universities. That same year, a Muslim woman was briefly jailed at a suburban Atlanta, Georgia, courthouse after refusing to remove her hijab in court. Some moms against hijab wearing . The debate over the hijab can literally hit home for some young Muslim women. Those that wear the hijab in the United States can befuddle their mothers, who often immigrated to the West so they could be free from wearing the hijab and other rules imposed on women. That's what happened to Hekmati, the Muslim-American from Detroit. Her mother, Behnaz, was puzzled by her daughter's decision to wear the hijab. Behnaz Hekmati grew up in Iran, where she did not wear the hijab. Young women who attended college in Iran like she did generally didn't wear the hijab, she says. Behnaz Hekmati warned her daughter that wearing the hijab would arouse the suspicion of Americans. ""I said Sarah, when you cover your head here the people think you are political -- they see you differently,"" Behnaz Hekmati says. Most of the trouble, though, came from Iranian-Americans, who came to the United States to escape the Islamic fundamentalists who seized power in 1979, she says. ""The Iranians here bother her more than Americans,"" Behnaz Hekmati says. ""They say, 'We got rid of you guys. We came here because we didn't want to see you guys anymore.'"" Hekmati was more concerned as a teenager about more personal issues, like her relations with boys. The hijab made it more difficult, she says. Few asked her on dates. Guys always seemed to put her in the ""friend category."" She wondered if she was attractive. ""I wondered at times: Am I always going to be a guy's friend and nothing more."" Strangers in public saw her as something else -- a subjugated woman. They looked at her with pity, she says. Some were just baffled. ""One guy asked me if I was allergic to the sun,"" Hekmati says. Abdelaziz, the New Jersey high school senior, also had her tense public encounters: angry looks, people feeling sorry for her or assuming her father ordered her to wear the hijab. ""It's not oppression; it's not that I'm accepting degradation -- it's about self-respect,"" she says. But it's more about faith as well. She says the hijab affirms ""Islam in the most respectful and purified way."" ""When you actually wear it, it opens your eyes,"" she says. ""It makes you want to explore your religious faith."" At times, Abdelaziz says she wonders what it would be like to attend her prom, get a tan at the beach and have a boyfriend. But she says her decision to honor her faith is already paying off. ""It really feels good,"" she says. ""It felt like I was missing something and now I'm complete. I finally understand my purpose.""","The hijab is the head scarf worn by Muslim women .

"London, England (CNN) -- Feared lost forever, 20 ancient ivory artifacts looted from Afghanistan's national museum were presented to the country's president, Hamid Karzai, in London Tuesday. The 2,000-year-old artifacts are the latest additions to the internationally acclaimed exhibition ""Afghanistan: Crossroads of the Ancient World,"" which starts its UK run at the British Museum this week. Stolen during Afghanistan's civil war between 1992 and 1994, the ivory inlays were once part of a hoard of treasures found at the ancient city of Begram, north of modern-day Kabul. ""These are an extraordinary set of ivories,"" said Neil MacGregor, director of the British Museum. ""Stolen from the National Museum in Kabul, bought by a London dealer specifically to return them, restored by conservators at the British Museum ... and after the exhibition they will go back."" Originally part of a set of Indian furniture owned by the Kushan rulers from the 1st century A.D., the ivories were first discovered by a French archaeologist in 1937. Found in a concealed room in the ruins of Begram's ancient palace, it's believed the treasures were hidden in a moment of crisis. They then lay forgotten for almost 2,000 years. The artifacts have now been given back to the National Museum of Afghanistan thanks to a philanthropic donor who bought the ivories from various black market dealers. ""(He's) retrieved what is probably the largest single group of antiquities that were known to be looted from the national museum during the civil war,"" said exhibition curator, St John Simpson. ""It shows what an important role the international community can play in recovering material that has been stolen and has been sold and can then be returned,"" added MacGregor. According to the British Museum, it's estimated around 70% of the artifacts once found in Afghanistan's national museum have been looted or destroyed over the past 30 years. Often the only way these precious relics are recovered is through international border agencies working in collaboration with museums and archaeological experts. So far, the UK has sent back one crate of seized artifacts to Afghanistan, with another shipment due to go back in the near future. The rest of the exhibition's 200 relics, spanning 4,000 years of the country's ancient history, are only with us today thanks to the actions of a few dedicated individuals. They were hidden on the eve of the Soviet invasion in 1979 by a handful of Afghans and lay undiscovered in vaults underneath Afghanistan's presidential palace for over thirty years. Now they are part of this traveling exhibition, which raises awareness and much-needed funds for the national museum in Kabul. ""Although we use these cliche terms for marketing purposes, these objects really do sing,"" said Simpson. ""They show the fragility of cultural heritage and how the Afghans who saved them for the world have done such a fantastic job raising cultural awareness and showing there is much more to Afghanistan then the cliched news clips that you normally hear or see.""","20 ivory artifacts looted from Afghanistan's national museum have been returned .

"Washington (CNN) -- Tea party favorite Rep. Michele Bachmann is getting ready to leave Congress at the end of this year, but what she isn't too sure about is another presidential run. ""I have no plan to run for president in 2016,"" Bachmann said in an interview with The Hill published Wednesday. ""I was so honored to be able to do it in 2012. It is one of the greatest experiences in my life. But I think the men who run will tell you too, it's one of the most difficult things you ever [embark] upon."" The Minnesota Republican has yet to completely rule out a bid. In a farewell speech at the Heritage Foundation earlier Wednesday, Bachmann encouraged Republicans to ""go bold"" on initiatives like tax reform if they takeover the Senate this election. ""You either go bold, or you don't go at all. If you want somebody to lead the debate, I'll lead the debate,"" she said. Bachmann has remained a fierce leader in the far right side of the conservative movement, particularly in regards to mobilizing the base. In 2010, she established the Tea Party Caucus in the House. She later went on to win the Ames Straw Poll in 2011, but went off to finish in sixth place in the Hawkeye State caucuses. Bachmann has mentioned that her retirement from Capitol Hill does not mean she'll be inactive in national politics. In July she told RealClearPolitics that there's a chance she could run against the ""various men"" that the media has speculated to run. She has since said that was a ""rhetorical comment."" ""The context of my remarks were that they were suggesting that no woman would be running for president on the Republican side, and I said, 'Well, I'm an obvious choice,'"" Bachmann told The Hill. ""So, that was the nexus of my remarks: Who knows, maybe I'll run. It wasn't that I was going to. It was just a rhetorical comment.""","The Minnesota Republican has yet to completely rule out a bid but said she has ""no plans"" to do so.

"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN) -- There were few answers Sunday about the fate of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, a day after contact was lost with the commercial jetliner en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. An aerial search resumed at first light, with aircraft searching an area of the South China Sea for any sign of where the flight may have gone down, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, the director general of civil aviation in Malaysia, told reporters . ""We have not been able to locate anything, see anything,"" Rahman said. ""There's nothing new to report."" The closest things to clues in the search for the missing jetliner are oil slicks in the Gulf of Thailand, about 90 miles south of Vietnam's Tho Chu Island -- the same area where the flight disappeared from radar early Saturday morning. A Vietnamese reconnaissance plane, part of a massive, multinational search effort, spotted the oil slicks that stretch between six and nine miles, the Vietnam government's official news agency reported. Malaysian authorities have not yet confirmed the Vietnamese report, Rahman said. The reported oil discovery has only added to a growing list of questions about the fate of the plane carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew members: What happened to the plane, why was no distress signal issued, and who exactly was aboard? Passenger manifest questioned . Bits and pieces of information have begun to form, but it remains unclear how they fit into the bigger picture, if at all. For instance, after the airline released a manifest, Austria denied that one of its citizens was aboard the flight. The Austrian citizen was safe and sound, and his passport had been stolen two years ago, Austrian Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Weiss said. Similarly, Italy's foreign ministry confirmed none of its citizens were on Flight 370, even though an Italian was listed on the manifest. On Saturday, Italian police visited the home of the parents of Luigi Maraldi, the man whose name appeared on the manifest, to inform them about the missing flight, said a police official in Cesena, in northern Italy. Maraldi's father, Walter, told police he had just spoken to his son, who was fine and not on the missing flight, said the official, who is not authsorized to speak to the media. Maraldi was vacationing in Thailand, his father said. The police official said Maraldi had reported his passport stolen in Malaysia last August and had obtained a new one. But U.S. law enforcement sources told CNN that both the Austrian and Italian passports were stolen in Thailand. ""No nexus to terrorism yet,"" a U.S. intelligence official said, ""although that's by no means definitive. We're still tracking."" Malaysian authorities have been in contact with counterterrorism organizations about possible passport issues, Malaysia's transportation minister Hishamuddin Hussein said. He did not state how many passport issues there are, saying authorities are looking at the whole manifest. The U.S. government has been briefed on the stolen passports and reviewed the names of the passengers in question but found nothing at this point to indicate foul play, said a U.S. law enforcement official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Of the two passports in question, the Italian one had been reported stolen and was in Interpol's database, CNN Law Enforcement Analyst Tom Fuentes said, citing sources at Interpol. Additionally, no inquiry was made by Malaysia Airlines to determine if any passengers on the flight were traveling on stolen passports, he said. Many airlines do not check the database, he said. During the news conference in Kuala Lumpur, Rahman declined to say whether the airline or Malaysian authorities had checked the database. Not ruling anything out . Malaysian authorities reiterated during a news conference that they are not ruling anything out regarding the missing aircraft. The Boeing 777-200ER departed Kuala Lumpur International Airport at 12:41 a.m. Saturday in good weather, and it was expected to land in Beijing at 6:30 a.m., a 2,300-mile (3,700-kilometer) trip. Air traffic controllers in Subang, outside Kuala Lumpur, lost contact with the plane about 1:30 a.m., Rahman said. Earlier, the airline said the jetliner lost contact at 2:40 a.m. The pilots did not indicate to the tower there may be a problem, and no distress signal was issued, the airline said. It may be days, possibly weeks or months, before authorities can offer any firm answers. It took five days for authorities to locate the wreckage of Air France Flight 447 when it crashed June 1, 2009, in the Atlantic Ocean, killing all 228 on board. It took four searches over the course of nearly two years to locate the bulk of Flight 447's wreckage and the majority of the bodies in a mountain range deep under the ocean. If Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 went down in the Gulf of Thailand, the recovery may be a bit easier because it is a relatively shallow area of the South China Sea, according to marine officials. Hussein, who in addition to being Malaysia's acting transportation minister is also its defense minister, said that the search area has been expanded because of the possibility the plane had turned back. China, Vietnam, Singapore and Malaysia were conducting search and rescue operations south of Tho Chu island in the South China Sea, according to the airline and reports from Xinhua, China's official news agency. Ships, helicopters and airplanes are being utilized. The USS Pinckney, a destroyer conducting training in the South China Sea, is being routed to the southern Vietnamese coast to aid in the search, the U.S. Navy said. The United States is also sending a P-3C Orion surveillance plane from Japan to provide long-range search, radar and communications capabilities, the Navy said. Meanwhile, the Chinese Coast Guard has ordered on-duty vessels to aid in the search, Xinhua reported, citing government officials. China also sent a diving and salvage team to the area where the airplane is suspected to have gone down, the news agency reported. Because of the Americans aboard the flight, the FBI has offered to send a team of agents to Malaysia to support the investigation into the disappearance if asked, a U.S. official familiar with the issue told CNN on condition of anonymity. Earlier, an official had said FBI agents were heading to the area. The FBI is not ruling out terrorism or any other issue as a possible cause in the jetliner's disappearance, the official said. Officials appeared resigned to accepting the worst outcome. ""I'd just like to say our thoughts and prayers are with the bereaved families,"" Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said during a news conference. Grief, especially in China . The plane carried 227 passengers, including five children under 5 years old, and 12 crew members, the airline said. At the time of its disappearance, the Malaysia Airlines plane was carrying about 7.5 hours of fuel, an airline official said. Among the passengers there were 154 people from China or Taiwan; 38 Malaysians, and three U.S. citizens. Relatives of the Chinese citizens on board gathered Saturday at a hotel complex in the Lido district of Beijing as a large crowd of reporters gathered outside. ""My son was only 40 years old,"" one woman wailed as she was led inside. ""My son, my son. What am I going to do?"" Family members were kept in a hotel conference room, where media outlets had no access. Most of the family members have so far refused to talk to reporters. The airline said the public can call 603 7884 1234 for further information. In Malaysia, the families and loved ones of those aboard the flight were gathered at the Everly Hotel in Putrajaya, south of Kuala Lumpur, according to Bernama, the Malaysian national news agency. Twenty of the passengers aboard the flight work with Freescale Semiconductor, a company based in Austin, Texas. The company said that 12 of the employees are from Malaysia and eight are from China. The airline's website said the flight was piloted by a veteran. Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah, a 53-year-old Malaysian, has 18,365 total flying hours and joined Malaysia Airlines in 1981, the website said. The first officer is Fariq Ab Hamid, 27, a Malaysian with a total of 2,763 flying hours. He joined Malaysia Airlines in 2007. Still an 'urgent need' to find plane . ""The lack of communications suggests to me that something most unfortunate has happened,"" said Mary Schiavo, former inspector general of the U.S. Department of Transportation, in an interview with CNN International. ""But that, of course, does not mean that there are not many persons that need to be rescued and secured. There's still a very urgent need to find that plane and to render aid,"" she said. Malaysia Airlines operates in Southeast Asia, East Asia, South Asia, the Middle East and on the route between Europe and Australasia. It has 15 Boeing 777-200ER planes in its fleet, CNN's Richard Quest reported. The missing airplane was delivered to Malaysia Airlines in 2002. Part of the company is in the private sector, but the government owns most of it. Malayan Airways Limited began flying in 1937 as an air service between Penang and Singapore. A decade later, it began flying commercially as the national airline. In 1963, when Malaysia was formed, the airline was renamed Malaysian Airlines Limited. Within 20 years, it had grown from a single aircraft operator into a company with 2,400 employees and a fleet operator. If this aircraft has crashed with a total loss, it would be the deadliest aviation incident since November 2001, when an American Airlines Airbus A300 crashed in Belle Harbor, Queens, shortly after takeoff from JFK Airport. Killed were 265 people, including five people on the ground. CNN's Jim Clancy reported from Kuala Lumpur, and Chelsea J. Carter reported and wrote from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- A photo series capturing the moments of terror faced by Westgate shoppers has won a Kenyan journalist the top honors at this year's CNN MultiChoice African Journalist Awards. Held in Tanzania on Saturday, Joseph Mathenge scooped the top prize for his work ""Images of Terror,"" which first appeared in Kenyan daily newspaper The Standard. Mathenge's photographs revealed the horrific attack from inside Nairobi's upscale shopping mall in September 2013. Mathenge said: ""It's a great honor, and I'm humbled to receive this award. All finalists who are here deserve this award. I hope it will motivate men, women and children of good will all over the world to fight terrorism. Memories fade with time, but pictures don't. We felt it necessary to capture each and every moment so that generations to come may see the horror."" Chairperson of the judging panel, Ferial Haffajee, said: ""Joseph Mathenge's photographs so eloquently captured one of Africa's toughest 21st Century moments that they were worth a thousand words. That said, the quality of all the winners' works made the contest a tightly run one."" The overall award carried a substantial cash prize, in addition to a three-week CNN Journalism Fellowship at CNN Center in Atlanta. All finalists received a cash prize and iPad Air, with runners-up also receiving an iPad mini. Mathenge was among a group of 28 finalists from 10 nations who attended the ceremony in Tanzania following a four-day programme of workshops, media forums, networking and sightseeing. Deborah Rayner, senior vice president of international newsgathering TV and Digital, CNN International, said the awards showcase excellence in journalism in Africa. ""By entering these awards, they have proved they have the determination, professionalism and courage to showcase Africa's stories to the world.""
