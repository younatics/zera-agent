"To this day, the 1973 film The Exorcist ignites feelings of sheer terror in anyone brave enough to watch it. The only comfort afterwards is that at least it's only fictional. But Jesuit scholars argue that the horrifying events truly did take place, when a young boy was demonically possessed in 1949. Packed into a university library - at the school which was attended by the real 'possessed' child - scholars and experts debated whether there was truth in the parody, just in time for Halloween. Scroll Down for Video . The real exorcism: Rev. John Padberg, director of the Institute of Jesuit Sources, tells a packed audience about the real demon-purging practice that took place at  St. Louis University's former hsopital . Jesuit scholars have joined a whole new generation of horror buffs in St. Louis to recount the supernatural incident. Saint Louis University hosted the panel discussion yesterday on the exorcism, which . involved the treatment of an unidentified suburban Washington, D.C., . boy. University junior Zach Grummer-Strawn has never seen 'The Exorcist' film, considered one of the finest examples of unadulterated cinematic terror. He's only vaguely familiar with the month-long 1949 demon-purging ritual at his school on which the film and William Peter Blatty's 1971 novel were based. 'I'd like to believe it's the real thing,' said Grummer-Strawn, a theology and sociology student from Atlanta. 'But you just can't know. That's part of why we're here. It's the pursuit of truth. And it's such a great story.' Terrifying: The Jesuit scholars argue that the story of a demonic-child in 1949 inspired the 1973 film The Exorcist, pictured . Iconic: The demon-purging ritual performed on the 12-year-old girl in the film was also carried out over a month-long period on a 13-year-old boy at the Missouri school's former hospital . About 500 people crammed into Pius XII Library, with some spilling into the aisles, leaning against pillars or sitting on desks. The university scholars and guest speaker Thomas Allen, author of a 1993 account of the events at the school's former Alexian Brothers Hospital, emphasized that definitive proof that the boy known only as 'Robbie' was possessed by malevolent spirits is unattainable. Maybe he instead suffered from mental illness or sexual abuse - or fabricated the entire experience. Assisted: The exorcism was carried out on the child by Father William Bowdern, who was assisted by Rev. Walter H. Halloran, pictured. Holloran expressed his skepticism about potential paranormal events before his death . Like most of religion's basic tenets, it ultimately comes down to faith. 'If the devil can convince us he does not exist, then half the battle is won,' said the Rev. Paul Stark, vice president for mission and ministry at the 195-year-old Catholic school. He opened the discussion with a prayer from the church's exorcism handbook, imploring God to 'fill your servants with courage to fight that reprobate dragon.' Some of the non-students in the audience spoke of personal connections to an episode that has enthralled generations of St. Louis residents. One man described living near the suburban St. Louis home where the 13-year-old boy arrived in the winter of 1949 (his Lutheran mother was a St. Louis native who married a Catholic). Another said she was a distant cousin of Father William Bowdern, who led the exorcism ritual after consulting with the archbishop of St. Louis, but remained publicly silent about his experiences - though he did tell Allen it was 'the real thing'. Bowdern died in 1983. Bowdern was assisted by the Rev. Walter Halloran, who unlike his colleague spoke openly with Allen and expressed his skepticism about potential paranormal events before his death a decade ago. 'He talked more about the boy, and how much he suffered, and less about the rite,' Allen said. 'Here was a scared, confused boy caught up in something he didn't understand. 'He told me, ""I simply don't know,"" and that is where I leave it,' the author added. 'I just don't know.' Allen zealously protects the anonymity of 'Robbie,' despite others' efforts to track him down to this day. It is unlikely the young boy's head was spinning 360 degrees, as actress Linda Blair's did in the 1973 film . Attendees to the panel debate appeared to be left divided on whether they believed demonic-possession truly happened or not. Pictured, a scene from the 1973 film . Gary Mackey, a 59-year-old accountant who left work early to attend the campus event, said he also is unsure whether 'The Exorcist' was a work of fiction or instead a riveting real-life account of barely comprehensible forces. He does know this: He cannot forget the movie that he saw with a buddy four decades ago. They drove 100 miles (160 kilometers) from their home in Louisville, Kentucky, to the nearest theater showing it across the state line in Cincinnati. 'I saw the movie when I was 19 years old and it scared me to death,' Mackey said. 'I think it's the scariest movie ever made.'","St Louis hospital spent a month trying to purge the demon from a child .

"Thierry Henry made an explosive start to life on Sky Sports by admitting Arsenal have 'gone backwards' over the last few years before his former side's 2-0 win against Manchester City. Henry, sitting alongside Graeme Souness and presenter Ed Chamberlin on Super Sunday, believes Arsenal are missing a world class holding midfielder to protect the likes of Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny. The 37-year-old stressed the importance of former team-mates Patrick Vieira and Gilberto Silva during Arsenal's unbeaten Premier League campaign in the 2003-04 season. He also claimed: .

Henry said of Arsenal's current side: 'Yes, they have gone backwards, it looks like they are a team who looks to finish fourth. 'When you look at Arsenal they should be trying to win the title. 'I’m sure Arsene, the fans and the board want more. You can be upset at Arsenal losing to Stoke City but it is the way they went after Arsene and the words they used. 'They are not far but they are missing a big piece. They are missing a (Patrick) Vieira and a Gilberto Silva. 'Those guys would have done anything to allow us to perform well. They protected the back four. Do Arsenal have that now, I don’t think so.' Henry believes Arsenal made a big mistake selling Alex Song and that he would be perfect for the side now .

Henry went on to lavish praise on former Arsenal midfielder Song by claiming the West Ham loanee would improve Wenger's side. 'Song would improve Arsenal,' said Henry. 'That is the type of player you want in front of your back four. 'Song is the captain of the boat. He protects the back four. You need someone to dictate, put players into position, make little fouls by kicking someone - like Claude Makelele used to do.' Arsenal have claimed just one point out of a possible 21 during their last seven visits to Manchester, something Henry urged his former side to address before their trip to the Etihad Stadium.

Sky Sports presenter Ed Chamberlin (far right) was joined by Souness and Henry . He said: 'Today has to be the day. I was playing before and Graeme too. 'Your pride has to kick in. Forget even about the Premier League. If I was at home and I was playing against my brother - one day, you have to go out there and prove you are a good team against a good team. That's not an easy task and hopefully they are going to do it today.' Souness, meanwhile, believes Arsenal are too nice to compete for the Premier League title and Henry did not disagree with his new colleague. 'Arsenal historically are too easy to play against,' stated Souness. 'I am a fan of Arsenal but they frustrate the life out of me. 'Would you like your daughter to date any of the Arsenal players?

Henry may just be Arsenal's lucky charm as his former side delivered an impressive performance to claim a 2-0 win at the home of the champions. The Frenchman said their performance was 'amazing' despite only having 32 per cent possession. Henry said after the match: 'Arsenal usually play with the ball but they were brilliant. They didn't have the ball for most of the game but the 32 per cent possession was enough to win the game. 'What a game Cazorla had today. People mention Alexis Sanchez but don't forget Santi Cazorla. He controlled the midfield. 'He is the man who makes the team tick. The only thing he didn't do well was the dance.' Souness added: 'The word that jumps out is disciplined. They denied space all over the pitch in a very un-Arsenal way. 'They were clinical. They defended brilliantly and never allowed any space. If they could just bottle it, then they would be a major threat.'

"Thug: Toby Hayden, 28, avoided a prison sentence after beating his ex-lover Loretta Butterworth last year and has been spared jailed again after attacking his new girlfriend . A thug who was spared jail after inflicting horrific injuries on his girlfriend during a drunken rage has walked free from court again after attacking his new partner. Serial offender Toby Hayden, 28, from Chippenham, Wiltshire, sparked outrage last year when he escaped with just a community order after leaving his ex-lover Loretta Butterworth, 22, covered in blood following a vicious beating. Just 12 months on from the first attack, the labourer has been hauled in front of the same court again after assaulting his current girlfriend Amy Weaver, 27 - but was only given unpaid work. Both times the labourer was serving a . sentence for a previous offence, but on each occasion, the court decided . not to hand him a custodial sentence. Loretta Butterworth, 24, said it was 'disgusting' her ex-boyfriend Toby Hayden had been let off with another fine. She . said: 'I think it's disgusting that he's assaulted four people, myself, . two police officers and his current girlfriend, and been given another . fine that he won't be able to pay off.' In Febraury 2013, Hayden turned violent because he could not withdraw money from a cash machine in Bath, Somerset. As a result, he repeatedly battered Miss Butterworth in the face. The . brutal assault only ended when a mother and daughter heard her . screaming 'please help me' as Hayden held her with one hand and hit her . with the other. Last March, a . hearing was told Hayden had consumer several shots of tequila, at least . eight pints and three cans of lager during the evening. The . court also heard that when police arrived to arrest him, he spat in the . face of one officer and tried to gouge the eyes of another. Battered: Hayden repeatedly battered Miss Butterworth in the face in 2013 and turned violent because he could not withdraw money from a cash machine in Bath, Somerset . He . was serving a suspended sentence for a previous violent offence at the . time of the attack - but still walked free from Chippenham Magistrates' Court. Last week, he was hauled back before the same court and admitted assault - but avoided jail again with a another community order of 50 hours of unpaid work. The sentencing hearing was informed that Hayden had been subject to a hate campaign, with numerous Facebook pages set up about him, and fellow convicts threatening him. Magistrates were told handing him more unpaid work would be 'setting him up to fail'. Thug: Miss Butterworth, who was 22 at the time, was left covered in blood after the attack in Bath, Somerset . But chairman Jonathan Chappell said: 'I am sure probation will do what they can to find you suitable work.' Hayden hit the headlines last March when pictures of his violent attack on Miss Butterworth emerged showing the pretty brunette bloodied and bruised. Speaking at the time Miss Butterworth said: 'He raised his arm and punched me in the face. It all happened so fast I didn't have time to defend myself. It felt like my face exploded, like an air bag had gone off. 'I fell to the floor and he kicked me and stamped on my face. I was knocked unconscious. 'When I came around I couldn't see out of my eyes as my face had swollen up so much. I looked like a zombie.' Miss Butterworth needed treatment at the Royal United Hospital in Bath after the attack and could not open her right eye for weeks. Violent: Hayden (pictured with Miss Butterworth) was hauled in front of Chippenham Magistrates' Court again, just 12 months after the first attack . After Hayden was shown injuries he said: 'I didn't know I was that much of an animal'. He was handed an 18-month community order with 200 hours of unpaid work and ordered him to complete an anger management course. Magistrates were told he would return from prison 'full of problems' and decided that custody would be the 'easy option'. But violent Hayden was hauled before Chippenham Magistrates Court again last week after assaulting his current girlfriend Miss Weaver on March 28 this year. Spared: Magistrates handling the case said not sending Hayden (pictured) to jail would be the 'tough option' Magistrates heard how, after an argument, he forcefully shoved Miss Weaver out the way and drove off in her car. Miss Weaver withdrew her complaint after six weeks but prosecutors pursued the case and Hayden pleaded guilty to common assault at the first opportunity. Michelle Hewitt, prosecuting, said: 'They had been arguing. She didn't want him to drive off in her car. 'He pushed her as he went past and left the house. 'Amy Weaver made a statement of withdrawal, telling police everything was true but she did not want to pursue it.' Moses Tawo, defending, said: 'He felt cornered. She was blocking his way. He pushed her out of the way just to get away. 'There were no injuries. She attended the first hearing, she wasn't supporting the charges. He still needs a bit of help with conflict resolution.' Hayden admitted using his girlfriend's car without insurance and a licence, and was fined £200 and got six penalty points. He was acquitted at trial of taking the car without consent. He must also pay £85 costs and a £60 victim surcharge. The court heard he already had £1,390 in outstanding fines, some in the hands of bailiffs. Reacting to the sentence, Polly Neate, Chief Executive of the . domestic abuse charity Women's Aid, said: 'Abusers often deny women the . freedom to live their lives through their controlling and violent . behaviour. 'Sentencing . guidelines state that domestic violence offences should be considered no . less serious than other crimes, and would often be more serious because . of their context. 'We expect and urge all courts to keep to these . guidelines to ensure that victims can be protected, and perpetrators . know abusive behaviour will be taken seriously.'","Toby Hayden, 28, escaped prison after beating Loretta Butterworth last year .

"A grand jury indicted Texas Gov. Rick Perry on Friday for allegedly abusing the powers of his office by carrying out a threat to veto funding for state prosecutors investigating public corruption – making the possible 2016 presidential hopeful his state's first indicted governor in nearly a century. A special prosecutor spent months calling witnesses and presenting evidence that Perry broke the law when he promised publicly to nix $7.5 million of state budget funds earmarked to run the public integrity unit run by the office of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg. Lehmberg, a Democrat, was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013, but refused Perry's demand for her resignation after a judge handed down a sentence of 45 days in jail and a $4,000 fine. She served about half of her sentence and refused to step down. If she had resigned, Perry, a Republican, would have appointed her replacement – effectively taking over an office that has been run by Democrats for decades. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A Texas grand jury indicted Republican Gov. Rick Perry on Friday on charges that he abused his position in a 2013 tussle over his state's Public Integrity Unit, headed by a Democratic official who was convicted of drunk driving . Rosemary Lehmberg was sentenced to 45 days in jail for DUI, about half of which she served before her release, and was ordered to pay a $4,000 fine . Though the Republican governor now faces two felony indictments, politics dominates the case. Lehmberg is based in Austin, which is . heavily Democratic, in contrast to most of the rest of fiercely . conservative Texas. The grand jury was comprised of Austin-area . residents. The unit Lehmberg oversees investigates statewide allegations of corruption and political wrongdoing, working from the state's most liberal county. Her office led the investigation against former U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, a Texas Republican who in 2010 was convicted of money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering for taking part in a scheme to influence elections in his home state. Those convictions were later vacated by an appeals court in a 2-1 decision led by two Republicans. Delay never served his three-year prison sentence, since his bail was continued pending appeals. Lehmberg's office has since demanded a judicial review to reinstate the conviction. She waived her right to appeal her own DUI conviction as part of the 2013 guilty plea that set Perry's wheels in motion. Along with other high-profile . Republicans, Perry argued that Lehmberg should resign after her humiliating and high-profile arrest and conviction. A . video recording made at the jail showed Lehmberg shouting at staffers . to call the sheriff, kicking the door of her cell and sticking her . tongue out. Her blood-alcohol level was nearly three times the legal limit for driving. Officers ultimately had to strap her into a specialized 'restraint chair' for her own safety. Jailhouse video showed that when officers told Lehmberg that she had been arrested for driving drunk, she shot back, 'That's y'all's problem, not mine.' 'Y'all are gonna be in jail, not me,' an intoxicated Lehmberg insisted when deputies removed her jewelry during the booking process. Eight months later, the Travis County Attorney's Office sued her in civil court to remove her from her job. Judge David Peeples, visiting from a nearby county – every jurist in Travis County had a conflict of interest – ruled in her favor. If prosecutors were to be removed from office for drunkenness, Peeples declared from the bench, officials had 'better get busy' impeaching officials all over the county and state. Liberals statewide cheered the outcome, including gay-rights advocates who saw the confrontation through the lens of identity politics. Lehmberg is openly gay, and Perry championed a 2005 Texas constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. Jailhouse footage showed an intoxicated Lehmberg arguing with officers and threatening that they would wind up in jail for 'ruining my career' After Lehmberg repeatedly kicked the door of her holding cell and verbally abused officers, they strapped her into a 'restraint chair' and later covered her face with a 'spit mask' Perry stands accused of abusing his office by warning that he would veto funding for the Public Integrity Unit, which Lehmberg (L) runs. The governor made his threat in an attempt to get Lehmberg to resign following her drunk driving conviction (booking photo at right) in 2013 . Mary Anne Wiley, Perry's general counsel, predicted on Friday that the governor will be cleared of the charges against him – abuse of official capacity and coercion of a public servant. 'The . veto in question was made in accordance with the veto authority . afforded to every governor under the Texas Constitution,' she said. Perry issued a public statement along with his veto, writing in June 2013 that '[d]espite the otherwise good work [of] the Public Integrity Unit’s employees, I cannot in good conscience support continued state funding for an office with statewide jurisdiction at a time when the person charged with ultimate responsibility of that unit has lost the public’s confidence.' David . L. Botsford, Perry's defense attorney, whose $450-per hour fees are . being paid for by state funds, said Friday that he was outraged by the indictment. 'This . clearly represents political abuse of the court system and there is no . legal basis in this decision,' Botsford said in a statement. 'Today's . action, which violates the separation of powers outlined in the Texas . Constitution, is nothing more than an effort to weaken the . constitutional authority granted to the office of Texas governor, and . sets a dangerous precedent by allowing a grand jury to punish the . exercise of a lawful and constitutional authority afforded to the Texas . governor.' Several top aides to Perry appeared before grand jurors, including his deputy chief of staff, legislative director and general counsel. Perry himself was not called to testify. Abuse of official capacity is a first-degree felony with potential punishments of five to 99 years in prison. Coercion of a public servant is a third-degree felony that carries a punishment of two to 10 years. In office since 2000 and already the longest-serving governor in Texas history, Perry isn't seeking re-election in November. Lehmberg was arrested in April 2013 for drunk driving and sentenced to 45 days in jail after she failed field sobriety tests (above) and tests showed her blood alcohol level was three times the legal limit . Lehmberg refused to step down after her conviction, despite Perry's demand, and the governor followed through on a threat to veto state funding for the 'public integrity' prosecution division she heads . When he ran for president in 2012, . Perry plummeted from brief front-runner to national punchline, his once . promising campaign doomed by a series of embarrassing gaffes. His most infamous 'Oops' moment came during a primary debate when he couldn't remember which three cabinet-level federal agencies he had promised to abolish if he were to win the White House. As . he eyes another run, Perry has re-made his cowboy image, . donning stylish glasses, studying up on foreign and domestic affairs and . promising conservatives nationally that he's far more humble this time . around. Political . observers say the indictment may not immediately hurt his standing with . Republican primary voters – but Democrats didn't miss a change to gloat . Friday. Texans deserve . real leadership and this is unbecoming of our governor,' Texas . Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa said in a statement. He . demanded that Perry immediately resign. Ray Sullivan, a former Perry chief of staff who took on spokesman duties during the 2012 presidential primary season, told the Austin American-Statesman that Friday's indictment 'certainly will be a big deal with the liberal media – Slate, Salon – and therefore for the national media.' 'It is beyond ridiculous,' Sullivan said, 'that Travis County is pursuing the governor, after letting the seriously drunk, police-disrespecting DA stay in office.' No one disputes that Perry is allowed to veto measures approved by the state legislature. But the liberal Texans for Public Justice government watchdog group filed an ethics complaint accusing the governor of coercion because he threatened to use his veto – before actually doing so – in an attempt to pressure Lehmberg to quit. Almost immediately after news of his indictment broke, Gov. Perry continued putting out red-meat messages for his conservative Twitter audience, continuing to send signals about a potential presidential run in 2016 . 'We're pleased that the grand jury . determined that the governor's bullying crossed the line into illegal . behavior,' said Craig McDonald, executive director of Texans for Public . Justice. 'The complaint had merit, serious laws were potentially broken.' Michael . McCrum, the San Antonio-based special prosecutor, said he 'took into . account the fact that we're talking about a governor of a state – and a . governor of the state of Texas, which we all love.' 'Obviously that carries a lot of importance,' McCrum said. 'But when it gets down to it, the law is the law.' McCrum . said he'll meet with Botsford on Monday to discuss when he will come to . the courthouse to be arraigned. McCrum said he doesn't know when Perry . will be booked. Although McCrum called more than 40 witnesses before the grand jury, Perry was not among them – a decision likely to add to a fast-growing controversy. 'That's prosecutorial discretion that I had,' he told the Associated Press on Friday. McCrum's control of the Perry grand jury became another political hot potato when he was named to the post: President Barack Obama had nominated him to serve as a federal prosecutor, but he withdrew his name from consideration after 11 months had passed without the U.S. Senate taking action to confirm him. Perry's indictment is the first of its kind since 1917, when James 'Pa' Ferguson was indicted on charges stemming from his veto of state funding to the University of Texas in an effort to unseat faculty and staff members he objected to. Ferguson was eventually impeached, then resigned before being convicted.","Travis County grand jury never heard testimony from the Republican governor, but indicted him on two charges that he abused his position .

"Have you ever heard of the baobab fruit? If you haven't you probably will soon. Demand for a new African ‘superfruit’ which boosts energy levels and skin health has soared to record highs in the UK. New figures show sales of the baobab fruit, which contains three times as much vitamin C as an orange, has increased by 1,600 per cent. Antioxidants: Baobab fruit have become increasingly popular in the UK with their citrus taste and health benefits . Brits have rushed to buy the nutrient-dense superfood, which has incredibly high levels of antioxidants and tastes like a blend of pineapple and melon. Baobab is an excellent source of calcium, potassium, thiamin and vitamin B6 - all vital nutrients known to benefit general health. Sourced from the African continent, baobab’s calcium source is a non-dairy one, making it an option for vegetarians too. the baobab range is available at beauty emporium and pharmacy John Bell & Croyden and a number of organics stores. Baobab trees: The fruit has been used in Africa for centuries as a source of natural well being . Since launching in October last year, sales figures are 60 per cent better than its closest market rival.Dr Lisa Ryan, of Oxford Brookes University, said: “Baobab is a rich source of potassium which plays a role in lowering blood pressure. 'It also contains calcium which is vital for bone health, has a high soluble fibre content which is important for digestive health. 'It is also rich in polyphenols which have potential health benefits against diseases like atherosclerosis, some types of cancer and type 2 diabetes.' Dietician Sian Porter said: 'Baobab is an excellent example of a nutrient-dense, low energy food - a real super food.' The superfruit has attracted interest from celebrities such as designer Vivienne Westwood and fashion reporter Suzy Menkes. Baobab grows in thirty two countries across Africa and has been brought to the mainstream by new Africa-inspired health and beauty brand Aduna. For centuries people in Africa have turned to the baobab tree as a source of natural wellbeing, benefiting skin, hair and general health. As a fruit, baobab is unique in that it dries naturally on the branch before it is harvested, the seeds are removed and then sieved into a powder. Available as a loose powder, it is ideal for adding to smoothies and juices, or using as an alternative to sugar for sweetening yogurt, muesli or cereal. Josie Elles, of John Bell & Croyden, said: “Since launching with us late last year Aduna baobab has become our best-selling supplement this year.

"Chelsea quartet John Terry, Gary Cahill, Eden Hazard and Cesc Fabregas all feature in EA Sports' team of the season so far, but there is no place for the Blues' star striker Diego Costa. The XI calculated by the EA Sports Player Performance Index ranks players on goals scored, assists, clean sheets, time on the pitch, and actions that contribute to victories and points won when in the side. Cahill and Terry have been Jose Mourinho's main central defensive pairing this season as the west London club sit top of the table, having conceded just 14 goals so far. Chelsea captain John Terry has led the Blues to the top of the Premier League with 46 points after 19 games .

In defence they are joined by full backs Nathaniel Clyne and Aaron Cresswell. Southampton's Clyne has prodcued the most tackles so far this season with 78, while Cresswell has played a pivotal role in West Ham's sixth-place position so far. David de Gea is the only Manchester United player to feature in the starting XI. The Spain keeper has been the Red Devils' stand out performer in goal this season and that is reflected by the fact he has the joint-second best save to shot ratio percentage in the league (75). De Gea is equalled in this stat by Swansea's Lukasz Fabianski and only bettered by Sunderland's Costel Pantillimon. In midfield, Fabregas makes the team of the season. He has completed the most passes (1563) and created the most chances (61) than any other player in the league after 19 games. In addition, the former Arsenal and Barcelona star has run 132.4miles  - a figure that only Stoke's Steven Nzonzi has beaten (133.4miles).

"Legislation to allow the birth of babies with genes from three biological parents should be put on hold because it is far riskier than previously thought, scientists warn. MPs are due to vote on whether the UK should become the first country to legalise controversial ‘three parent babies’ after Government watchdog the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) gave it the go-ahead. Advocates have compared the IVF technique, which involves inserting a small set of genes from a second mother, to ‘changing a battery’, saying it had no real impact on the baby’s core DNA. Advocates claim the IVF technique, which involves inserting a small set of genes from a second mother, to ‘changing a battery’, saying it had no real impact on the baby’s core DNA (File photo) But a growing number of scientists and MPs say new research indicates that such children’s genetic make-up could be affected far more profoundly than had been realised and they may develop unpredictable physical and mental character traits. They say that tests on animals have fuelled fears that people born using this technique – called mitochondrial DNA transfer – could also face problems such as reduced fertility, shorter lives, learning difficulties and cancer. Even the respected New Scientist, which had backed the technique, last month called for more research, saying: ‘It appears we may have seriously underestimated the influence that mitochondria have. Research suggests they play a key role in some of the most important features of human life. ‘This raises the ethically troubling prospect – once widely dismissed – that children conceived in this way will inherit vital traits from three parents.’ The IVF technique involves taking the nucleus out of the egg of a mother likely to be carrying faulty mitochondria – the ‘batteries’ that power cells – transferring it into a healthy egg donated by another woman, resulting in a baby free from a range of devastating mitochondrial diseases. But it means the baby would contain genetic material not only from his or her mother and father but also from the donor. Mitochondria may have their own genes which would interact with matching DNA in the nucleus of the cell that could have a much larger impact on a child than has been believed. The IVF technique involves taking the nucleus out of the egg of a mother likely to be carrying faulty mitochondria – the ‘batteries’ that power cells – transferring it into a healthy egg donated by another woman . Dr Edward Morrow, senior research fellow in evolution, behaviour and development at Sussex University, said the latest discoveries were ‘really important’, adding there was now ‘plenty of data suggesting we need to be more concerned than the authorities seem to be’. Stuart Newman, professor of cell biology and anatomy at New York Medical College, said the proposed procedures would pair up different genes in an ‘arbitrary fashion’. He said: ‘An analogy would be the engines of a Jaguar and a Rolls-Royce. Each car needs an engine, and the engine does the same thing in both cars. But things would go very wrong if you simply swapped them between the two cars. It is difficult to anticipate what developmental or physiological malfunctions would result from a mismatch.’ Tory MP Edward Leigh said the new research illustrated how ‘ill-prepared we are to interfere with the genetic make-up of human beings. ‘The rush towards legalising genetically modified babies must be halted in light of these new findings.’ But proponents of the IVF treatment said the benefits were huge and denied they were involved in ‘Frankenscience’. Prof Doug Turnbull, of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Mitochondrial Research at Newcastle University, said: ‘The risks are small compared to the risks those families face of having children with serious mitochondrial diseases.’ The HFEA, which ruled in July that the technique was ‘not unsafe’ and which will regulate the technique, said its expert panel has reviewed more research into the area ‘than any other body or group of scientists in the world’. It said many of the issues being raised had been considered and it can ‘see no reason for changing its in-depth views on this matter at this time’.","MPs are to vote on whether UK should become first country to legalise controversial ‘three parent babies’

"James Holmes reached out to multiple women on a sex website in the days before launching a massacre which killed 12 people and injured 58 during a screening of The Dark Knight Rises, it has emerged. However, at least three of the women he contacted through AdultFriendFinder rejected his advances - even though he was apparently just hoping to 'chat' with 'nothing sexual' on the cards. The news follows rumours that Holmes may have broken up with a girlfriend shortly before the shooting in Aurora, Colorado, and that he was due to be evicted from his apartment after dropping out of grad school. Gunman: James Holmes apparently contacted at least three women online days before the Aurora shooting . Picture: Holmes posted this photograph of himself with a poster of model Keeley Hazell on his site profile . The 24-year-old gunman's profile on AdultFriendFinder first came to light the day after he attacked a midnight screening of the Hollywood blockbuster. It shows pictures of Holmes with dyed red hair posing with a poster of British model Keeley Hazell, and features the chilling tagline, 'Will you visit me in prison?' The PhD dropout wrote on the site that he was looking for 'a fling or casual sex' - and described himself as 'a nice guy'. But one of the women who was in contact with Holmes told TMZ she thought he was 'just looking to maybe chat... nothing sexual'. He asked to meet up with her but she turned down the request, as did two other women who talked to TMZ about their communication with him. Profile: Holmes said he was looking for 'a fling or casual sex' in his posting on AdultFriendFinder . Holmes had dropped out of the University of Colorado weeks before the attack and was nearing the end of his grace period for staying at the institution's accommodation. Aurora police chief Daniel Oates also hinted that Holmes had recently gone through a break up and that authorities were investigating the claim. A former classmate from the University of Colorado suggested another cause for the killings, describing Holmes as someone who had lost touch with reality after becoming 'obsessed' with video games. The classmate told the Daily Mail: 'James was obsessed with computer games and was always playing role-playing games. Inside the life of a killer: After spending hours dismantling the many booby traps set up around James Holmes' Aurora apartment, police investigated the area and took pictures of the evidence . 'I . can’t remember which one but it was something like World of Warcraft, . one of those where you compete against people on the internet. 'He . did not have much of a life apart from that and doing his work. James . seemed like he wanted to be in the game and be one of the characters. 'It . seemed that being online was more important to him than real life. He . must have lost his sense of reality, how else can you shoot dozens of . people you don’t know?' It . is also believed that Holmes was due to be evicted from his flat. The . 24-year-old, who is now in police custody, pulled out of the university . weeks before the deadly attack. Neighbours told TMZ anyone living in the block had to be enrolled at the university otherwise you had 30 days to evacuate. It is not known exactly when Holmes . stopped going to classes but it is thought he was nearing the end of the . 30-day grace period. Interests: Glimpses into Holmes' apartment show that he had a poster of the video game Soldiers of Misfortune . Earlier Aurora police chief Daniel Oates addressed the hunt for a motive for Holmes's murderous actions, telling CBS' Face the Nation: 'I’ve heard one morsel of information about a relationship that may or may not be true. 'That’s . why we have all our investigators working on this. That’s why we . brought in the FBI behavioral analysts. They’re going to figure all that . stuff out. 'There will be . no easy or quick answers. And maybe there will never be any answers. This requires a lot of work. And we’re just not in a position to give . any indications of that now. 'And again, whatever we do develop, the . proper place to make sure we get proper justice for the victims is to . reveal that stuff in the course of the criminal prosecution.' This . clue came out on the same day as it was revealed that in addition to his . profile on AdultFriendFinder, Holmes also had a profile active on the . dating website, Match.com. Inspecting carefully: Police and fire officials carried out the search of Holmes' apartment . During . the same interview, Mr Oates said that they had spoken with someone . who was an acquaintance of the 24-year-old shooting suspect, leading . many to initially fear that the investigation had not come to an end. 'This was a person . who had contact with the suspect, a casual acquaintance,' Mr Oates told CBS News. 'We found him . yesterday, we interviewed him.' During the talk with Face The Nation's Bob Schieffer, Mr Oates was quick to downplay the questioning. 'The relationship was really inconsequential and we're happy that we spoke to him. That's all that was,' he said. A witness at the scene initially said that he thought he saw a second man helping Holmes during the attack. The male witness who saw Holmes . launch his deadly attack says he thought he also saw someone open the . doors of the movie theatre to let the shooter in. Anti-social: Holmes was thought to be a recluse who covered his windows with black garbage bags so that no one could see in . Insight: Pictures have not been released of the interior of his apartment, so the only glimpses come from the outside looking in . The witness, who has not been named, . told KCNC it appeared that a cinemagoer who left the screening after . receiving a telephone call deliberately left the emergency exit open. Holmes used the emergency exit to access the screening of the Hollywood blockbuster in Aurora, Colorado. The . witness said: 'As I was sitting down to get my seat, I noticed that a . person came up to the front row, the front right, sat down, and as . credits were going, it seemed like he got a phone call. 'So . he went out toward the emergency exit doorway, which I thought was . unusual to take a phone call. And it seemed like he probably pried it . open, or probably did not let it latch all the way. 'As . soon as the movie started, somebody came in, all black, gas mask, . armour, and threw a gas can into the audience, and it went off, and then . there were gunshots that took place.' Mr Oates was clear to mention that . while they were still trying to determine the circumstances leading up . to the fatal attack - and what, if any, motive the young man had - he said . that police are confident in saying that he acted alone. 'All . the evidence we have, every single indicator, is that this was all Mr . Holmes' activity. He wasn't particularly aided by anyone else,' Mr Oates . said during the interview. Massacre: 12 people were left dead and 58 injured in the Colorado shooting . The . first time that police began to think that there may have been an . accomplice was when a local officer received a threatening electronic . message Saturday evening, demanding that Holmes be released from custody . or else the sender would become violent. The sender and the format of the . message have not been released publicly, but police investigated the . threat and appear confident that there was no accomplice. They spent hours on Friday and Saturday in Holmes' apartment, dismantling the many booby traps and explosives that the madman had set up to kill whomever entered his apartment. Unconfirmed reports state that Holmes had a Batman poster adorning one of the walls. Police chief Oates would not comment on the poster, but photographers did capture a portion of a different poster while investigators were examining the shooter's apartment. A poster for a video game called Soldiers of Misfortune is visible- and fitting considering both Holmes' interest in video games and his maniacal course of destruction that has torn Aurora apart. Witness: This man claims to have seen someone leave the emergency exit of the cinema open for Holmes near the beginning of the film . Ritchie Duong told the Los Angeles . Times that he has known Holmes for more than a decade and they also both . attended undergraduate school at the University of California, . Riverside, where they saw each other once a week to watch the television . series Lost. They last met in December for dinner and a movie. Mr Duong says at the time, Holmes seemed fine. He also says academics came easily to Holmes both at high school and at the UC Riverside. Mr Duong says he remembers that in one college class they had together, Holmes didn't take notes but would just sit through class and always got an A. Police have surmised that the grad school dropout had seemingly spent months planning the murderous assault, as he had amassed a stockpile of arms and explosives over long period of time.","Profile on AdultFriendFinder read 'Will you visit me in prison?'

"Cherie Blair was accused of ‘irresponsible scaremongering’ today after claiming legal aid cuts would make it easier for the state to take children into care. The barrister wife of former Prime Minister Tony Blair attacked the coalition’s plans to remove £220 million from the legal aid budget by 2018-19. She claimed parents would be in ‘trouble’ defending themselves against state moves to remove children, but the claims were angrily dismissed by the Ministry of Justice. Barristers and solicitors listen to speeches during a demonstration outside Parliament . An effigy of Justice Secretary Chris Grayling was carried through the streets around Parliament in protest at his cuts to legal aid . The government is pressing ahead with plans to cut £220 million from the legal aid budget by 2018-19 . Hundreds of lawyers today marched on Westminster in protest the cuts as thousands of barristers stage a second walkout at courts in England and Wales. Barristers have chosen not to attend proceedings at major crown courts in London, Manchester, Birmingham and Liverpool, among others. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling is pressing ahead with fee cutting fees for well-paid barristers and solicitors to save millions. Scaremongering: Cherie Blair claimed parents would find it harder to stop their children being taken into care as a result of the cuts . But Mrs Blair, a QC, warned it was triggering a ‘real crisis’. She told Sky News: ‘Our criminal system doesn’t work unless each side is properly represented. ‘And the legal aid cuts, which could be as much as 30 per cent at the moment, mean it’s going to be more and more difficult for people where the state is taking you to court, whether it’s about a criminal offence or perhaps the state its taking your child into care, if you don’t get proper representation then you’re going to be in trouble defending yourself.’ However, the government hit back, insisting legal aid would still be available to cases involving children. A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: ‘Our reforms present no change to the current system where anyone charged with a crime, or subject to criminal investigation, is provided with a qualified lawyer through legal aid. ‘We are only proposing average 6 per cent or 2 per cent changes to most barristers’ fees. After our reforms we will still be spending around £1.5 billion a year, meaning it will still be one of the most generous legal aid systems in the world. ‘As for claiming children will be taken into care without a lawyer being involved, that is just irresponsible scaremongering. ‘We have specifically ensured legal aid is, and will remain, available for these types of cases.’ Outside Parliament, banners were raised reading ‘Access to Justice RIP’ and ‘Save Legal Aid’. Janis Sharp, whose son Gary McKinnon narrowly avoided extradition to the United States, Blur drummer-turned-solicitor Dave Rowntree and Paddy Hill, one of the Birmingham Six, were among those speaking at a rally opposite the Houses of Parliament. At the Old Bailey, only five out of 18 of the criminal courts were sitting today . A barrister uses a mobile phone to take a photograph of the demonstration against cuts . Hundreds of protesting barristers in their full court dress of wigs and gowns posed the Chris Grayling effigy and a Magna Carta scroll which was later delivered to the Ministry of Justice . A barrister holds a sign accusing Mr Grayling of 'killing justice' Actress Maxine Peake, who plays a TV barrister, joined the protests. The star, who plays QC Martha Costello in BBC1’s Silk, carried a placard declaring: 'Defend justice. Not just for the rich.' She has warned: 'We have to send a message to this Government that we will no longer stand for their ferocious bullying of the poor.' At the Old Bailey, only five out of 18 of the criminal courts were sitting today. The hacking trial and that of Nicky Jacobs for the murder of Pc Keith Blakelock were among those to resume on Monday. Nigel Lithman, chairman of the Criminal Bar Association (CBA), said: ‘If these cuts are not addressed, then the British justice system, which is held in such high esteem around the world, will cease to exist as we know it and the British public can no longer expect true justice to be delivered. ‘It is simply expected that the criminal Bar will accept cuts unparalleled in any other sector of the wider community. ‘The Bar cannot and will not accept these unnecessary and crippling cuts and will continue to fiercely oppose them at every opportunity until our reasonable requests have been met with the appropriate levels of consideration.’ Barristers refused to attend court for the first time in January, causing widespread disruption to criminal justice. The CBA and London Criminal Courts Solicitors Association (LCCSA) claim fee cuts are financially unnecessary, will cause significant damage to the criminal justice system, and drive skilled and experienced lawyers away from publicly-funded criminal work. There are already a number of crown court cases emerging in which defendants have been unable to secure a barrister. It is the second time that barristers have staged a walk out on the cuts, after the first in January . The protesters were joined by a woman dressed as the 'Lady of Justice', from the dome of the Old Bailey, holding a sword and the scales of justice . It is claimed that as a result of the changes junior barristers face rates as low as £20 a day . The Ministry of Justice has previously . said it is vital to scale back 'one of the most expensive' legal aid . schemes in the world and insisted it will remain 'very generous' even . after the changes. But the CBA said many junior barristers face rates . as low as £20 a day, once the hours of preparation, time in court and . chambers’ fees are factored in, as well as receiving no holiday pay, no . pension provision and no sickness or maternity benefits.","Barrister wife of Tony Blair backs walkout by barristers over cuts .

"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has called for the establishment of an independent panel to help stamp out diving and to retrospectively ban those found guilty. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho this week spoke out over what he saw as a 'clear campaign' against the Barclays Premier League leaders after midfielder Cesc Fabregas was cautioned by referee Anthony Taylor for simulation in the match at Southampton, when the player looked to have in fact been tripped by defender Matt Targett in the penalty area. It is not the first time this season Chelsea have found themselves at the centre of a diving storm. Wenger makes a point to an official, and has called on diving decisions to be taken out of referees' hands . Cesc Fabregas was booked for a dive after seemingly being tripped by Southampton defender Matt Targett . Forwards Diego Costa and Willian were both booked for supposedly taking a tumble in the win over Hull, while on Boxing Day, the West Ham manager Sam Allardyce accused Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic of going down 'looking for a penalty'. Wenger - who had a touchline bust-up with Mourinho during Arsenal's defeat at Stamford Bridge in October - quipped he 'very much' felt sorry for the supposed campaign against Chelsea players. However, the French manager agrees something must be done to eradicate the trend of those looking to win an unfair advantage. Fabregas makes his point to referee Anthony Taylor but Chelsea were still punished on the pitch . Mourinho and Wenger have had differences but the Frenchman has sympathised with his opposite number . 'I am against diving. We should punish after the game. The problem will be to decide when it was obvious diving or not. That is a big issue and sometimes it is not obvious,' said the Arsenal boss, who takes his side to Southampton on New Year's Day. 'Yes (there should be a panel), and the most suited to this are people who have an experience in the game, and (then) to punish only obvious cases, but not mixed ones. 'Naming (those guilty) alone doesn't work, you have to suspend the players. (How long should the ban be?) I don't know. It depends. 'I am not a specialist in this kind of thing, but the only way that the players will stop doing it, is if they feel they can get punished. 'Is it Arsenal, or Manchester United, or Liverpool or Chelsea? It is  the same for everybody.' Arsenal, of course, are not immune to accusations of simulation. Robert Pires infamously took a tumble against Portsmouth which resulted in a controversial penalty during the Gunners' Invincibles campaign of 2003-04, while striker Eduardo was initially banned by UEFA for diving when winning a spot-kick in the Champions League qualifier against Celtic in August 2009, which was eventually overturned on appeal. Robert Pires (left) famously dived to win a penalty in a win over Portsmouth during the Invincible season . Wenger accepts sometimes such instincts are part of a footballer's make-up. He said: 'It is difficult for me to judge what's happening anywhere else on that front, but you can never really meet a manager who says he is in favour of diving anyway. 'We had them, with Pires, with Eduardo. It is down to the players. '(But) even if you talk to the players, the guys who have that in them, they will do it in the game. It is just coincidence.' However, Hull City manager Bruce was not convinced by Wenger's suggestion of a panel, despite insisting that some action needs to be taken. Bruce claims players diving threatens the honesty of the Premier League that makes it admired across the world. Steve Bruce labelled Gary Cahill's fall against his Hull City team as like 'something out of Swan Lake' The Hull boss isn't sure that a panel is the way ahead, but believes action must be taken against divers . Last month the Hull boss compared a Gary Cahill dive against his side to 'something out of Swan Lake', but admits it can be tough to differentiate between dives and fouls with some players. Bruce said: 'It's very difficult for referees when you have people like [Eden] Hazard and Willian, who are genuinely quick and take you on with a low centre of gravity - the slightest tap can take them over. 'But when you see a blatant dive, I think you have to take action. The reason why the Barclays Premier League is the league that it is, is for its honesty, its integrity and ferocity. 'You must remember that people enjoy the honesty of the Premier League all over the world. We can't make it like every other league - it's a different culture. 'I'm not so sure about a panel, but we have to start taking action against it.'","Arsenal boss says obvious divers should be handed bans .

"Power pose: Jonny Spelman says his mother Caroline is so angry she is even threatening to kick him out of the family home . A Cabinet minister’s teenage son has accused her of turning her back on him because of his obsession with bodybuilding. Jonny Spelman, 17, says his mother Caroline is so angry she is even threatening to kick him out of the family home. He switched to weight training when he was suspended from rugby for taking steroids. Prior to the 21-month ban he was playing for the under-17 England team. Jonny, who attended £10,000-a-term Tonbridge School in Kent, is asking fellow weightlifters to help fund his bid to go full time. He has also registered at a job centre near his millionaire parents’ home in Solihull, West Midlands, and touted himself as a handyman. The revelations are a huge embarrassment to Mrs Spelman, who has spent more than £60,000 in the courts trying to keep her son’s drug use a secret. The Tory Environment Secretary’s website states that her children are her top priority and that she always makes sure they ‘eat well, sleep well and are happy at school’. In one online video, which has now been removed, her muscular son begs his fans for money and offers to post private clips of himself working out in exchange for their help. ‘My aim is to be the biggest guy there ever was ... basically you know I wanna be the next Mr Olympia,’ he said in the posting, according to a Sunday tabloid. ‘Obviously this does come at a price, I’m afraid, as I’ve chosen bodybuilding as my life and my parents have sort of decided that they’re not happy with that. ‘They’ve told me eventually I’m gonna have to move out and they’ve stopped supporting me financially. ‘So the YouTube viewers have become very important to me as a way of basically... keeping me fed and continuing to grow.’ Despite his age, Jonny last month came . second in the under-23 section of the United Kingdom Bodybuilding & . Fitness Federation’s Bodypower competition in Birmingham. Change: Mr Spelman, far left, turned his sporting ambitions to bodybuilding after being banned from rugby . Striking a pose: The Cabinet minister's son became one of the youngest sportsmen in Britain to be banned for using performance enhancing drugs . Mother: Tory MP Caroline Spelman said in a previous statement that helping their son through his ban was a priority . He . boasted that his achievement was unheard of for a 17 year old, and . vowed to continue with his dream of becoming a bodybuilder. In a posting on his YouTube site he wrote: ‘Need some donations to help fund my growth as choosing to become a bodybuilder has unfortunately lost the support of my parents.’ His page links to an Amazon wishlist of diet supplements. On a bodybuilding forum, writing under the name J.Spel, he posted a message saying: ‘Any jobs going in Birmingham area? ‘Need an income, life is too tough at the moment! Can’t afford anything bank balance is ****.’ He also asked for advice on taking intravenous supplements, which drew criticism from more experienced bodybuilders. On her personal website, Mrs Spelman describes the challenge of trying to combine politics and motherhood. ‘My children are my top priority and as long as they eat well, sleep well and are happy at school I know we can do this together,’ she says. ‘Most importantly, I protect my family time; a roast lunch on Sunday, football in the garden and making cakes on rainy days.’ Mrs Spelman was unavailable for comment last night.","Jonny Spelman says mother Caroline is threatening to kick him out of family home .

"Richard Overton, the oldest living United States veteran at 108 years old, credits his longevity to two things. First there's his 'medicine' - the tablespoon of whiskey he adds to his morning coffee, which he claims keeps his muscles tender. Then there's the dozen or so cigars he smokes - but doesn't inhale - everyday. Overton was at the center of last year's Veterans Day parade in Arlington - accepting a celebratory box of beloved cigars during a standing ovation - and appeared again this year at the parade near his home in Austin, Texas. Scroll down for video . Fighting fit: Richard Overton, pictured outside his home in Austin, served in the South Pacific during World War II from 1942-1945. This year he turned 108 years old . Star of the show: Richard Overton, America's oldest WWII veteran at 108, takes a picture during the Veterans Day parade in Austin, Texas, on November 11, 2014 . Overton, was born in Bastrop County, served in the Army during World War II. He served in the South Pacific from 1942 to 45. He sold furniture in Austin after the war and later worked for the state Treasurer's Office. He still drives and walks without a cane. During a television interview last March, he told a reporter that he doesn't take medicine other than aspirin. And of course his morning whiskey. The key to living to his age, he said, is simply 'staying out of trouble'. Still looking good: Overton volunteered for service in 1624 (left) and served in the South Pacific until 1945. Now 108 (right) he likes to remain active . More than 100 people packed a conference room at the Stephen F. Austin building in downtown Austin last November for a ceremony honoring Overton and Ken Wallingford, who spent 10 months in a tiger cage as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. The event was overseen by the General Land Office and the Veterans Land Board. 'I've gotten so many letters and so many thank-yous and I enjoy every bit of it, but I'm still going to enjoy some more,' said Overton. Though widowed 22 years ago he still lives in the house he built in Texas after the end of the war. Overton was in his 30s when he volunteered in 1942 and saw action in the Pacific with the Army's 188th Aviation Engineer Battalion. Resilent: Richard Overton is believed to be America's oldest living veteran. He turned 108 this year . Richard Overton is applauded as the US President acknowledges him during a Veteran's Day ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia, November 11, 2013 . Obama elaborated on Overton's proud record to the crowd last year. 'He was there at Pearl Harbor when the battleships were still smoldering,' Obama said. 'He was there at Okinawa. He was there at Iwo Jima.' The president added that Overton still rakes his own lawn and drives ladies in his neighborhood to church every Sunday in his old Ford pickup. Overton also believes in staying active as much as possible. He said that if there's leaves to rake or a driveway to clean, he's going to go out and do it. Honored: President Barack Obama greets Richard Overton, with Earlene Love-Karo, in the Blue Room of the White House on November 11, 2013 . But while he is a proud returned serviceman, Overton said we should be careful about being proud of war. 'War's nothing to be into,' he told USA Today last year. 'You don't want to go into the war if you don't have to. But I had to go. 'I enjoyed it after I'd went and come back, but I didn't enjoy it when was over there. 'I had to do things I didn't want to do.'","Richard Overton served in the South Pacific during World War II from 1942 to 1945 .

"Vicars will be able to swap their cassocks for jeans, T-shirts and even shellsuits at services, weddings and funerals after the Church of England approved the radical ‘makeover’ last night. Rules requiring clergy to don traditional vestments were swept aside by a vote at the General Synod, the Church’s ‘Parliament’, as part of efforts to make services more relevant to modern congregations. The Church will now draw up rules to permit clergy to wear what they deem appropriate for services, as long as they have the permission of their bishop. From this to that?

The . Most Rev Justin Welby said there was a problem with radicalisation of . Muslims in Britain and an 'issue' with young men travelling to Syria and . returning to the UK 'highly radicalised'. But, speaking in an interview on BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show, the Archbishop said the proportion of Muslims in Britain who are radicalised remained 'extraordinarily small'. He said there was a danger of a 'national culture of fear' over the issue. 'Clearly there is an issue with people going to Syria and coming back highly radicalised. There is a problem with radicalisation,' he said. 'But the proportion of Muslims who are radicalised is extraordinarily small and I'm just edgy about developing a national culture of fear because I don't think that gets us anywhere and I think we're in danger of slipping into a very fearful culture in which we see everyone against us and us against everyone and we're constantly trying to defend ourselves.' Hysteria: Speaking in an interview on BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show, the Archbishop of Canterbury, right, said the proportion of Muslims in Britain who are radicalised remained 'extraordinarily small' The decision to relax the dress code for vicars came as the Synod prepared to debate the adoption of a 'shorter, clearer' liturgy for use at baptism services. Members of the General Synod meeting in York will discuss a proposed new service which removes references to rejecting the Devil. Instead it will require parents and god parents to say that they 'turn away from sin' and 'reject evil'. The changes are designed to help people attending the services who may not have any previous connection to the Church. A report for the Church's Liturgical Commission said: 'Clergy frequently find themselves conducting baptisms for ""un-churched"" families, sometimes at services separate from the main Sunday morning act of worship. 'On these occasions there may be a few people present who have a developed understanding of the Church's language and symbolism. 'For the majority of those attending, the existing provision can seem complex and inaccessible.'","Some vicars have already indicated they will 'dress down' for services .

"Playing with puzzles and building blocks alongside parents is more beneficial to toddlers than learning to read and write at a young age, according to a university psychologist. Cambridge University lecturer David Whitebread said it was important for parents to play with their children, as these youngsters were more likely to enjoy solving problems, and better equipped to cope with failure. Former primary school teacher Mr Whitebread also claimed the government was overly concerned with getting children to learn the 3Rs at an ever decreasing age, and said younger children were better off learning to cook alongside their parents. Value: Playing with puzzles and building blocks alongside their parents is more beneficial to toddlers than learning to read and write at a young age, according to a university psychologist . 'If you want your child to do well at school, then spend time with them in early life,' he told The Times at the Lego Idea Conference in Denmark. 'They need episodes of shared attention, doing puzzles, reading books or playing with building blocks.' Mr Whitebread, a developmental cognitive psychologist, said that although learning to read was an important skill, teaching reading, writing and arithmatic to toddlers was a waste of government money and the child's time. Skill: Mr Whitebread, a developmental cognitive psychologist, said although learning to read was an important skill, teaching reading, writing and arithmatic to toddlers was a waste of government money . He said that studies have shown toddlers who were taught to be 'self-regulated' learners were more likely than their contemporaries to enjoy problem solving, and more likely to know what to do if they made an error. A US study found that by the time children who learned how to be self motivated became adults they had achieved higher grades academically, earned more money and were less likely to be involved with crime. Separate . research has shown there was a link between a toddler's ability to . concentrate on different tasks and their language skills. Mr Whitebread said that learning to read at to young an age could even be damaging for a child. 'Instead . the parent can share something they love, such as making cakes, or . tinkering with engines, the key is partly sharing the enthusiasm but . mainly the conversations you have with the child while doing it.'","Cambridge lecturer says toddlers are better off playing with their parents .

"The former Bishop of Chelmsford John Gladwin is pressing for rules to be relaxed so that clergy can report serious crimes such as child abuse . For centuries the secrecy of the confessional has been sacrosanct, but the Church of England may relax the rules to allow clergy to reveal serious crimes such as child abuse. Former Bishop of Chelmsford John Gladwin – who last year led an inquiry into clerical sex abuse in the Church of England – is pressing for the changes, along with members of the Church’s ‘parliament’, the General Synod. But any change will be fiercely resisted by traditionalists who think clergy should retain the trust of worshippers. It will also cause tensions with Roman Catholics, who believe the seal of the confessional should remain inviolable. Bishop Gladwin’s moves follow a decision by the Anglican Church of Australia to allow its priests to report crimes they hear during confession to the police. The sacrament of penance, in which a believer privately confesses their sins to a priest, is usually associated with the Catholic Church. However about a quarter of the Church of England’s clergy hear confessions – usually face to face in a private room rather than in a booth in a church. The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby last year urged more Anglicans to adopt the practice, saying the experience could be ‘enormously powerful’. However Bishop Gladwin, whose report for Archbishop Welby led to an apology by the Church to victims, said: ‘It is very important that anything criminal that involves the abuse of people should not be protected. Action has to happen.’ He said the Church of England had to ensure any reforms were workable, but the Australian Church had provided ‘a very good model’. For more than 400 years clergy have been banned under Church law from disclosing ‘secret and hidden sins’ revealed by penitents, including criminal offences. But in July the General Synod of the Anglican Church of Australia voted to allow clergy to go to the police if the person who confessed refused to do so, saying the safety of victims must be paramount. These crimes include child abuse, child pornography or other offences that would lead to a jail term of five years or more. Dioceses in Australia are expected to introduce the changes by the end of the year. And the Rev Simon Cawdell, a member of the Church of England’s General Synod, has tabled a motion calling for Church law to be amended so priests are no longer compelled to keep confessions of abuse confidential. The issue could be raised at the next General Synod meeting in November, as bishops brace themselves for tough questioning from a Government inquiry into abuse in institutions including the Church. A Church of England spokesman said: ‘The guidelines for clergy are being considered for debate in November at General Synod. The Australian model is one of a number of options which will be considered as part of the ongoing discussions.’ However one senior Synod member said: ‘If we go down the Australian route we have destroyed the priesthood. You should be able to go to a priest and tell them everything. This is the Roman Catholic tradition and we have always followed it. If we did something different now it would upset everybody.’ And the Catholic Bishop of Arundel and Brighton Kieran Conry said a Church of England rule change could put pressure on the Catholic Church to do the same, but added: ‘We will never relax the absolute requirement of confidentiality.’","Church of England may relax rules to allow clergy to reveal serious crimes .

"Archaeologists have found a complete 3,200-year-old skeleton, pictured, with cancer. The find could help show how the disease has evolved . Archaeologists have found a complete 3,200-year-old skeleton with cancer and say the discovery could help show how the disease has evolved. The remains of the wealthy man, believed to have been between 25 and 35 when he died, were found in a tomb close to the River Nile in Sudan last year. The bones showed evidence of metastatic carcinoma - cancer which has spread from where it started. Analysis proved it came from a malignant soft-tissue tumour and spread across large parts of the body, making it the oldest ‘convincing’ example of metastatic cancer ever found, the authors of the study said. Researchers from Durham University and the British Museum said the discovery will help to explore underlying causes of cancer in ancient times and provide insights into the evolution of cancer in the past. Although it is one of the leading causes of death today, it is extremely rare in archaeological finds compared to other detectable killers. This has led scientists to conclude cancer is a product of modern lifestyles and increased longevity, but the discovery shows cancer did exist in the Nile Valley in 1200 BC. Michaela Binder the lead author from Durham University's Archaeology Department, said: ‘This may help us to understand the almost unknown history of the disease. The sternum of the skeleton, believed to have belonged to a man aged between 25 and 35, pictured, shows evidence of cancer, highlighted by the arrows .

Carcinoma is the most common form of cancer to occur in humans but it’s origin cannot always be determined.

'We have very few examples [before] the first millennium AD. ‘We need to understand the history of . the disease to better understand how it evolved and for that it is . important to find more examples.’ The . Austrian archaeologist added: ‘Our analysis showed that the shape of . the small lesions on the bones can only have been caused by a soft . tissue cancer even though the exact origin is impossible to determine . through the bones alone.’ Binder found the bones at the once-populated Amara West site, 750km (466 miles) downstream from the modern capital of Khartoum.

The researchers could only speculate on the cause of the cancer, with theories being carcinogens such as smoke from wood fires, genetic factors or from an infectious disease caused by parasites. To this day, the parasitic infection known as schistosomiasis is a cause of bladder cancer and breast cancer in men in the area.

Arsenal made late a check on Loic Remy's transfer status ahead of Monday's transfer deadline. The QPR striker has completed a move to Chelsea, but the Gunners enquired to see on how far his move to Stamford Bridge is down the line. But it is understood the North London club were told that his move to Chelsea was virtually complete meaning Arsene Wenger will have to look elsewhere for a new forward.

"Bishop Paul Butler said that the long-awaited investigation would not start work until almost five months after it was announced, because of Fiona Woolf’s existing workload . A senior Church of England bishop has criticised delays created by the controversial appointment of a high-profile lawyer to lead the Government’s historic child abuse inquiry. The Bishop of Durham, Paul Butler, who is the chairman of the Church’s committee on abuse, said that the long-awaited investigation would not start work until almost five months after it was announced, because of Fiona Woolf’s existing workload. And he highlighted concerns that until the inquiry begins, officials accused of a cover-up could be shredding important documents. His intervention comes after The Mail on Sunday revealed Mrs Woolf has close links to Tory grandee Leon Brittan, accused of failing to investigate alleged VIP paedophile rings when Home Secretary. It can also be revealed that the 66-year-old commercial lawyer, who, as Lord Mayor of London, has spent much of the past month on overseas business, has not yet responded to urgent calls to appear before MPs. Bishop Butler told a child protection conference: ‘Given her very heavy duties as Lord Mayor, it is hard to see how the inquiry will be able to get under way until late November at the earliest. ‘This is an unfortunate delay, since the initial announcement was made in early July. It has already led to concerns being expressed about files being shredded in Government departments and elsewhere.’ Lord Mayor of the City of London Fiona Woolf (left) has been named as the chairman of the independent inquiry commissioned by the Government into historic child sex abuse; Lord Brittan (right) with his wife, Diana . The inquiry suffered an earlier setback when retired judge Baroness Butler-Sloss was forced to step down as the original chairman because her brother had handled child abuse cases involving high-profile figures when he was Attorney General in the 1980s. The Home Office has also admitted it has lost 114 files relating to allegations of child abuse over three decades, fuelling claims of an establishment cover-up. Meanwhile, the Home Affairs Select Committee, which is carrying out its own inquiry into child sexual exploitation, asked Mrs Woolf to give evidence about her role and potential conflicts of interest after the MoS discovered her links with Lord Brittan. She lives on the same street, sits on a City board with him and also worked as a magistrate with his wife Diana. But three weeks after Mrs Woolf’s appointment was announced, she is yet to agree a date to appear. MP Keith Vaz, the chairman of the committee, said: ‘The committee is very keen to see Fiona Woolf appear before it.’ But he admitted Mrs Woolf’s office have not yet responded to requests for her to appear and insisted: ‘We will press her.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Bishop of Durham, Paul Butler,  said that long-awaited investigation would not start work for almost five months because of Fiona Woolf’s workload .

"An exact re-enactment of the first shot fired at the beginning of World War I at 12.45pm on August 5, 1914 occurred precisely 100 years later today at Point Nepean in southern Victoria. Hundreds of relatives of those who fought attended the special centenary ceremony held at the Point Nepean barracks which lays claim to firing the first shot of all the British allied forces during World War I. It was the first incident involving Australian troops with the first shot taking place just three hours and 45 minutes after the war was declared in Australia an entire century ago. Scroll down for video . An exact re-enactment of the first shot fired at the beginning of World War I at 12.45pm on August 5, 1914 occurred precisely 100 years later on this day at Point Nepean in southern Victoria . The Last Stand was played at the ceremony attended by hundreds of loved ones and dignataries . Point Nepean lays claim to the first shot taking place just three hours and 45 minutes after the war was declared 100 years ago . Federal environment minister Greg Hunt, who attended the ceremony on behalf of Prime Minister Tony Abbott, said nobody could have imagined the years following the first shot and the sacrifices that would be made from a population from just under 5 million. ‘417,000 enlisted, 332,000 served overseas, 152,000 were wounded and 61,000 never came home,’ he said. ‘Of the 270,000 to return more than half had been wounded and others had mental scars which never healed.’ ‘We acknowledge those who have done what we have not.’ Although England declared war on Germany at 11 pm in London on August 4, 1914, it was not announced in Australia until 12.30pm on 5 August by then Prime Minister Joseph Cook due to the time difference. At the moment the war was declared, the German freighter Pfalz (outbound from Melbourne) sailed to Point Nepean to have her papers checked. Being found in order, she was given clearance to resume her voyage to sea under the guidance of an Australian pilot. At 12.45 pm, however, the declaration of war was flashed to Point Nepean and before the ship could reach the entrance, a shot was fired across her bows as an order to return to port. The Pfalz then anchored off Portsea, the master and crew were interned, and the ship was renamed HMAT Boorara and became a troop carrier. Hundreds attended the ceremony on Tuesday to pay tribute to those who lost their lives in World War I . The battle was the first war to have been fought by land, sea and air . The Pfalz anchored off Portsea and the master and crew were interned, while the ship was renamed HMAT Boorara and became a troop carrier . Hundreds attended the ceremony to pay their respects to the 61,000 soldiers who never came home . One of those who returned was James Rule who was only 24 when he joined the Western Australian Imperial Regiment and embarked for northern Africa in 1914. After training in Egypt, he was deployed to Gallipoli where he quickly learnt the difficulty of war. He told his children how some of his friends had died in his arms; how not all the ANZAC soldiers had rifles and some men had to take them from dead soldiers in order to defend themselves; how the Australian soldiers did not have enough to eat, but that the British soldiers would sometimes share their rations with them and how it was a particular treat when the British would share their dark chocolate. Though he survived the war and returned to Australia where he had eight children and lived until he was 78, he would talk on occasion about the horrendous terrain, the poor planning and how he waded through water infested with maggots because of the decomposing bodies left in the trenches. In what was perhaps his last photograph before that ordeal, James Rule posed with the other 702 members of the 11th Battalion on the Great Pyramid of Giza in what is now one of the most iconic photographs of Australia's involvement in the First World War. On the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of The Great War, Rule is one of the few men who have been identified from the photograph and whose story is known. In one of the most iconic photographs of the First World War, the 11th Battalion AIF posed on the Great Pyramid of Giza to have their photograph taken . The section of the photograph that James Rule (third from right) features in is the source of many myths, including that the linked men were all related and died the day after the photograph was taken . The Western Australian Genealogical Society has divided the photograph up in a grid and assigned each soldier a number, the year numbers are people who are partially verified, the green number represent those whose identities are fully verified . His daughter Beth Smith, 72, has been involved in the project of finding the identities and stories of the other soldiers. Mrs Smith, a retired school registrar from Perth, says she has known about the photograph for a long time and bought a print 15 years ago. 'There's no photo of war like that, really. There are so many stories to tell about each of the men, it's quite amazing... It is a very interesting piece of history in the one photo. Naturally I'm quite proud, my dad is in it,' she told Daily Mail Australia. The photograph is mentioned in the diary of Captain Barnes from the 11th Battalion, who wrote on Sunday January 10, 1915: 'After Church this morning the whole Battalion was marched up to the Pyramid (Old Cheops) and we had a photo took or at least several of them.' There is incredible detail in the photograph, for instance, Mrs Smith says that one of the kneeling officers in the front row is holding a whistle, which was used to tell the men when the photograph was about to be taken to make sure they were all looking in the same direction. In fact, Mrs Smith's father is the source of some of the more persistent rumours about the photograph. He is pictured in a row of four men, all with their arms crossed, all holding hands. One myth is that the group was a father and three brothers, all of whom died the following day, which is false. Rule (back right) pictured with a group at training before he was deployed to North Africa . James Rule returned to Australia where he had eight children, including Beth (pictured) who has been working on finding the stories of those in the photograph. He is pictured in 1966 at the age of 75, three years before he died . Mrs Smith says that she and her sister were once visiting Ballarat in Victoria and saw the photograph for sale in a shop. 'One shop told us that they [her father and the three other men] were all from that town and they all died. It's quite amusing.' 'I do wonder what that was about and I wish I'd asked him when he was alive,' she said. The Western Australian Genealogical Society have launched an appeal to identify the remaining soldiers in the photograph. They are asking for people who may have had relatives in the 11th Battalion to send in information and have created a grid and numbering system so that each person is easy to identify. Mrs Smith, who has been conducting research about the wartime experiences of some of the men in the photograph, could then send the relatives some information about their ancestor and what they went through in the war. 'I think it would be so exciting [to discover your relative in the photograph] because whenever I see an old photo of one of my ancestors I always get so excited and such an iconic photo as it is, you'd be even more flabbergasted, it would be phenomenal,' she said.

"It is perhaps the greatest of stately homes, the sprawling Yorkshire estate that was setting for the television series adaptation of Brideshead Revisited. And now the breathtaking spectacle of Castle Howard is again the setting for the turbulent drama of an ancient aristocratic family. The Mail on Sunday has learned that Simon Howard, who has run the 18th Century home for 30 years and lived in it his whole life, is set to leave the 10,000-acre estate along with his wife Rebecca – and Simon's elder brother Nicholas and his wife Victoria Barnsley have indicated to Simon that they intend to move in. Scroll down for video . Simon Howard and his wife Rebecca have been forced to leave 10,000-acre Castle Howard by his brother . Friends of Simon say he was approached by Nicholas and Victoria in September and asked to step down as chairman of the board that runs Castle Howard, or face being outvoted by the directors of the private company. At the time Simon, 58, was being treated for throat cancer, although he has recently been told he is clear of the disease. It is understood that staff at the North Yorkshire ancestral seat will be told tomorrow of the changes, and Simon and Rebecca are said to be 'in shock' and 'devastated'. A friend of the couple said: 'It is beyond belief. Simon was a wreck of a man when he heard. 'His heart is ripped apart. The house is his whole life.' Nicholas Howard and his wife Victoria Barnsley have said they intend to move in to the sprawling estate . Another friend close to the family expressed her outrage over the move, especially after the success that Simon has found in running the estate, which attracts a quarter of a million visitors a year. The friend said: 'Simon has run a very tight ship. The house has been his lifeblood. 'Rebecca has been an incredible chatelaine. She has run the place amazingly inside and out. She adores the place because she has always been into history. 'The timing of this has been deeply upsetting for the family.' Castle Howard, which was designed by Sir John Vanbrugh and built between 1699 and 1712, has been home to ten generations of the Howard family. Spreading out over 145 rooms, the house is considered one of Vanbrugh's greatest achievements. Its magnificent art collection includes ancient sculptures, Old Masters and works by Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Gainsborough. The house and estate is owned by Castle Howard Estates Ltd, of which Simon, who is chairman and managing director, and his elder brother Nicholas, 62, are each 50 per cent shareholders. In February, Victoria, 60, who was the chief executive officer of London publishing giant Harper Collins until she stepped down in August 2013, also joined the Castle Howard board, but Rebecca has never been elevated to such a position of control, despite helping to run the household. The iconic estate was the setting for the TV series Brideshead Revisited starring (l-r) Anthony Andrews, Diana Quick and Jeremy Irons . Exactly what has happened behind the scenes to bring about the switch at Castle Howard was not clear last night, although friends said Rebecca, 47, herself a scion of the Sieff family who founded Marks & Spencer, feels badly treated. One said: 'Rebecca felt that if there was a position on the board of directors that naturally, as Simon's wife and the chatelaine of the house, she would be accepted immediately on to the board. 'However, this was rejected. I don't know the ins and outs of this but I think Simon felt very pushed into a corner. 'I know that Rebecca was deeply hurt and upset and couldn't really understand what was going on.' According to another friend, the addition of Victoria to the board, whose directors include Nicholas's 28-year-old son George, meant that Simon feared he could be voted out because of his health issues, and he felt he had little option but to give up the running of the estate, although he is to remain a director of the company. Castle Howard, which was designed by Sir John Vanbrugh and built between 1699 and 1712, has been home to ten generations of the Howard family . Spreading out over 145 rooms, the house is considered one of Vanbrugh's greatest achievements . There is strong speculation that he, Rebecca and their 12-year-old twins, Merlin and Octavia, who are educated locally, will move out of the house, where they occupy one of the wings. One friend said that Simon and Rebecca had been told that one likely consequence of the 'putsch' is that Nicholas and Victoria will move into Castle Howard. Simon, the former High Sheriff of North Yorkshire, has been waging a battle with throat cancer for much of this year, but a medical scan last week found he was free of the disease. In August, he said: 'A lump was removed from my throat and it was found to have cancerous squamous cells. It was a bit of a shock at the time, but it was removed successfully and I have just completed a precautionary seven-week course of radiation therapy. 'As things stand, I have been very lucky and I am in the clear.' According to a family friend, the latest development will cast a shadow over the festive preparations at the estate, where an elegant row of illuminated Christmas trees already line the driveway. 'That is what is really sad about this situation,' said the friend. 'The brothers have not always seen eye to eye. Rebecca has been hosting these wonderful Christmas and family gatherings where everyone has been included and she has healed rifts over the years. She bends over backwards to be hospitable.' Nicholas Howard has made his reputation as a London-based photographer, with a home in the fashionable Bayswater district. He has photographed top artists such as Antony Gormley and Grayson Perry and his pictures of Castle Howard were exhibited at the house in 2008. Mr Howard married Victoria Barnsley, who created the publishing company Fourth Estate before becoming CEO of Harper Collins, in 1993, and they have a daughter, Blanche, 20. His son, George, is from his first marriage to Amanda Nimmo, the daughter of actor Derek Nimmo. The couple divorced in 1990. Its magnificent art collection includes ancient sculptures, Old Masters and works by Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Gainsborough . Castle Howard was also the setting for the 2008 film version of Brideshead, which starred Emma Thompson, Michael Gambon, Matthew Goode and Ben Whishaw . When Nicholas and his family visit Castle Howard as a guest of Simon and Rebecca, they are said to stay in rooms that he and his brother used as teenagers. Simon took over the running of the estate as a 27-year-old in favour of his elder brother Henry, who battled health problems and died in 2008. Earlier this year, the Castle Howard estate won a high-profile case against HMRC at the Court of Appeal, with a landmark ruling that the custodians should pay no capital gains tax on the £9.4million sale of a portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds. Part of the 2001 auction sale went towards Simon's divorce from his first wife, Annette, that year. Rebecca has recently taken to spending a few days each week away from Castle Howard at a rented house on a neighbour's estate, which Simon also visits. The Howards say that with 250,000 visitors a year at Castle Howard, it is only natural that they would seek a bit of peace and quiet. Rebecca's induction into North Yorkshire country life has not always been smooth. An infamous 2002 article in Vanity Fair, penned by former friend Plum Sykes, described her as 'the woman who set out to marry a house', claiming she fell in love with Castle Howard after watching Brideshead Revisited in the 1980s. Simon took over the running of the estate as a 27-year-old in favour of his elder brother Henry, who battled health problems and died in 2008 . In recent years the house has featured in the 1995 film The Buccaneers, and Garfield: A Tail Of Two Kitties . The highly praised 1981 television adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's classic novel starred Jeremy Irons, Anthony Andrews and Diana Quick, and tells the story of the aristocratic Roman Catholic Marchmain family. It put the stately home on the international map. Castle Howard was also the setting for the 2008 film version of Brideshead, which starred Emma Thompson, Michael Gambon, Matthew Goode and Ben Whishaw. In recent years, it has featured in the 1995 film The Buccaneers, and Garfield: A Tail Of Two Kitties, released in 2006. It was also the exterior set for an estate in Stanley Kubrick's 1975 film Barry Lyndon. Earlier this year some of the castle's grand interiors were captured in incredible detail as part of the video sculpture, Breathless Beauty, Broken Beauty, by Vanessa Jane Hall, displayed at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Neither couple would comment when approached by The Mail on Sunday.","Simon Howard is set to leave 10,000-acre Castle Howard  with wife Rebecca .

"It could be the solution to the stress of commuting – and even mean the end of those apologetic calls home from stranded trains or the ‘car park’ on the M25. This motorised paraglider comes in a suitcase, is put together in ten to 15 minutes and can soar above the queues for up to three hours. It features a propeller, a small engine and a reinforced polyester wing and is the brainchild of TV adventurer Bear Grylls, who has developed the machine with Dorset-based company Parajet. Adventurer Bear Grylls developed the BG Paramotor with Dorset based company Parajet . The pilot is attached to the engine with a harness and needs a run-up of just 65ft to take off and even less to land. He controls the machine by pulling handles to steer it left or right and using a throttle to climb or descend. Even if the engine cuts out, the ‘wing’ should be able to glide to safety. The aircraft can be packed and stowed in a car boot. Or a commuter could carry the harness like a backpack into the office, while carrying the other parts in lightweight bags. Ex SAS-man Grylls, 40, said of his £12,800 machine: ‘It’s like being lifted off the ground and then soaring like a bird. You swoop in to land, before touching down on your feet. And there are no hard parachute landings like we used to have in the military.’ It can reach 35mph, depending on the weather, and has a range of about 100 miles – the equivalent of Winchester to Eastbourne, or Birmingham to Liverpool. Grylls flew an earlier version to the top of Everest, and similar machines have crossed the Channel. The adventurer, left, used a similar machine to cross the Channel and even fly over Mount Everest, although it is so small it can even be packed up and put into the boot of a car, right . Although aimed at the adventurous, the Bear Grylls Paramotor has already been employed for more routine journeys. Staff at Parajet, based in Semley, have used it to fly to work, and one made an impressive entrance at a dinner party by landing on a lawn already dressed in his tuxedo. The price includes ten days’ training. But there are some regulations for the fed-up commuter to consider. Big cities like London have restricted airspace to keep them clear for commercial jets, while in other built-up areas pilots must stay 1,000ft above the tallest buildings and 500ft from any person, vessel, vehicle or structure.","Adventurer Bear Grylls flew an early version of the machine over Everest .

"The Americans admitted they may have inadvertently encouraged the Argentinians to invade the Falkland Islands, it emerged last night. The former head of the CIA privately confessed that Argentina may wrongly have believed its  support for US covert operations in Central  America would mean Washington's 'acquiescence' for the 1982 invasion. In fact, despite friction between London and Washington, the Pentagon provided vital behind-the-scenes support for the British military to retake the islands.

'They may have believed that their support for the US in covert operations in Central America was more important to the US than in fact it was, and could be expected to earn them American acquiescence in forward policy elsewhere.' Sir Nicholas also recalled handing US Secretary of State Alexander Haig a piece of paper detailing British evidence of Argentina's intention to invade on April 2, 1982. He said: 'Mr Haig's reaction to the information I had given him was electric.' Sir Nicholas added: 'He wanted us to win and would have been horrified if the Argentinians had got away with it.'

"Arsenal are close to signing Atletico Madrid holding midfielder Mario Suarez as Arsene Wenger begins his January spending spree, according to reports in Spain. The 27-year-old played 22 games last season as Atletico won La Liga and made it to the Champions League final, but has fallen out of favour this season. With the likes of Gabi, Tiago, Raul Garcia and Saul Niguez ahead of him in the pecking order under Diego Simeone, Suarez is looking to move on. Mario Suarez (left) battles with Juventus' Roberto Pereyra during a Champions League group game . Suarez has fallen behind the likes of Gabi, Tiago, Raul Garcia and Saul Niguez in Diego Simeone's plans . According to respected Spanish journalist Eduardo Inda, a former editor of Madrid-based paper Marca, Suarez 'will almost certainly go in the winter transfer window'. And Arsenal, who are short of options in the holding role, are his most likely destination as Wenger attempts to secure Champions League football for a 17th straight year. The Gunners boss revealed on Tuesday that he is looking for a midfielder to help cover for injuries in the squad, with Wenger having to recall Francis Coquelin from a loan spell at Charlton recently to play alongside Mathieu Flamini. Suarez was a key member of the Atletico side that reached last season's Champions League final . The midfielder is a local boy who has been at Atletico since he was 12, but is now set to move away . 'If you look at the number of games some players played and the injuries we have with Wilshere, Ramsey and Arteta, we are a bit short at the moment in midfield,' Wenger said. Suarez, capped twice for Spain, has been at Atletico since he was 12 years old, with the exception of a two-year spell at Mallorca, who sold him back to his first club in 2010.

"A minibus driver has been jailed for more than six years after a crash that left a young woman dead and many of her friends injured as they travelled to a hen party. Bethany Jones, 18, died in April last year while travelling to a hen party in Liverpool with 20 others, including her mother Diane and sister Amy. Minibus driver James Johnson, 64, was driving at just 5pmh on the M62 in West Yorkshire when the bus was hit from behind by a lorry. Bethany Jones (right), 18, died in April last year while travelling to a hen party in Liverpool in a minibus driven by James Johnson (left). He has been jailed after pleading guilty to causing Miss Jones's death . Johnson was driving at just 5pmh on the M62 in West Yorkshire when the bus was hit from behind by a lorry, shunting it 50 yards along the road and into a barrier, leaving it lying on its side across an exit slip road . Johnson was sentenced to six years and eight months in prison after he pleaded guilty to causing Miss Jones's death by dangerous driving at an earlier hearing at Leeds Crown Court. The court heard that when Johnson was assessed after the crash it was revealed that he had suffered two mini-strokes - in 2009 and 2011 - and had an IQ of 71, with poor concentration and memory. The second stroke happened while he was driving 16 nurses in a minibus on the same motorway as the fatal crash. A collision was only avoided after one of the nurses applied the handbrake and stopped the bus. He was granted a new three-year licence in 2011 and did not inform the DVLA about his medical conditions. Sam Green, mitigating, said Johnson's mental impairment meant he did not realise he should not have been driving. The court was also told that the 24-seater coach driven by Johnson had mechanical problems and was travelling extremely slowly along the motorway when the crash happened. Trainee nurse Miss Jones was travelling with 20 other women, including her mother and sister . Johnson, from Bradford, failed to take any action to avoid the collision, ignoring warnings from passengers and other road users, who were sounding their horns. He failed to leave the motorway at the exit, pull on to the hard shoulder or use his hazard lights. Trainee nurse Miss Jones was pronounced dead at the scene after suffering multiple injuries. Bride-to-be Stefanie Firth, 24, was among the 21 people seriously injured in the crash, including Miss Jones's mother and sister. Judge Guy Kearl QC, sentencing Johnson today, said: 'You ought not to have been driving.' His defence lawyer, Mr Green said Johnson, who had one previous conviction in February 2012 for using a mobile phone while driving, had an 'overwhelming sense of guilt' about his role in the collision. Victim impact statements read to the court said the lives of the families of all the bus passengers had been affected by the crash. 'The speed of the impact was devastating to all in the coach, yourself included,' Judge Kearl told Johnson. 'Every person on the coach sustained serious injuries.' He added: 'Your passengers were 20 females aged between 18 and 59 years. They were going on a night out, a hen night. 'They were mothers, daughters, sisters and friends. Each of them had put themselves in your hands to carry them safely to their destination. They trusted you with their lives.' The judge continued: 'This event has devastated their lives and those of their husbands, partners, their parents and their boyfriends. 'It has devastated their lives physically, emotionally and, in some cases, financially.' Johnson's Mercedes minibus began showing signs of mechanical error just minutes into the hen party journey on April 26 last year. The passengers on the bus quickly became aware of signs of mechanical failure, including a smell of burning, and asked Johnson to stop the vehicle. He did stop the bus, which was later found to have a badly burnt-out clutch, and made a brief 'cursory' examination but said he could not find a problem and continued the journey. The speed of the coach gradually slowed to a crawl until it was travelling at just 5.5mph in the nearside westbound lane of the M62, just after junction 32, near Pontefract. The court heard that the 24-seater coach driven by Johnson had mechanical problems and was travelling extremely slowly along the motorway when lorry driver Kevin Ollerhead crashed into the back of the vehicle . Passenger Stacey Tulley was among the 21 people seriously injured in the crash. Above, mourners attend the funeral of Bethany Jones . It had come to a 'near standstill' when lorry driver Kevin Ollerhead, 45, crashed into the back of the vehicle, shunting it 50 yards along the road and into a barrier, leaving it lying on its side across an exit slip road. Mr Ollerhead, of St Helens, Merseyside, was found not guilty of causing the death of Miss Jones by dangerous driving after a trial at Leeds Crown Court last month. He told the court he was a professional driver and there was nothing he could have done to avoid the collision. Judge Kearl said the collision was 'an accident waiting to happen'. He said to Johnson: 'Had your coach not been struck by the heavy goods vehicle driven by Mr Ollerhead, it would have been by someone else, if there had not been an intervening miracle. Minibus driver Johnson, pictured arriving at Leeds Crown Court for sentencing today . 'This was, quite literally, an accident waiting to happen.' He continued: 'You were, in effect, together with the passengers on your coach, a sitting duck.' The judge said Johnson, who has been driving coaches since 1976, had shown a flagrant disregard for the rules of the road and the safety of other road users by failing to take action to avoid the collision. He said: 'It would have been obvious to anyone, and particularly an experienced coach driver, that travelling at those speeds was dangerous on any motorway, let alone the A1M and M62 - two of the busiest motorways in the country. 'There was an apparent disregard to the great danger posed to others, both on the road and in your coach. You had flagrantly disregarded the rules of the road by driving so slowly.' Sarah Johnson, who was on the bus at the time of the collision and was a friend of Miss Jones, read a statement outside the court on behalf of all those affected by the crash. She said: 'Today's court result will never ease the pain and suffering caused to so many by the actions of James Johnson. 'On that day, as the ladies got on to James Johnson's minibus for what was to be the start of a fun-packed weekend, nobody could have imagined the devastation that lay ahead. 'The lives of so many have been changed for evermore due to the lack of action resulting in the collision. 'The loss of Bethany is deeply felt by not only her loving family, Paul, Diane, Amy and Ryan, but all those who knew and loved her. 'We now ask that all those involved be allowed to grieve and continue to recover from their injuries in private.' Sergeant Ann Drury, of West Yorkshire Police, described the crash as a 'truly appalling incident'. She said: 'The 26 April 2013 will be a date forever etched into memories of the close-knit community of South Elmsall and it saw the commencement of a long and intricate investigation. 'James Johnson was employed as a professional driver to take a group of ladies to Liverpool for what should have been a happy and enjoyable weekend. He failed in his duty that day. 'He also failed to act when his passengers made him aware that there was a problem with the vehicle. The scene of the fatal accident in 2013 on the M62 where a Farmfoods lorry went into the back of the coach . 'The subsequent collision the bus was involved in resulted in the death of Bethany Jones and, for many, significant life-changing injuries as well as the traumatic memory of that day's events. 'I am pleased the court process has come to an end today with the sentencing of Johnson for his part in a truly appalling incident. 'Our thoughts remain with Beth's parents, wider family and all those affected by what happened on the M62 that day.' Samantha Davidson, Senior Crown Prosecutor, CPS Yorkshire and Humberside said: 'This was an appalling tragedy and my thoughts remain with Bethany's family and with all those who were injured in this incident. 'Johnson's passengers alerted him to a burning smell in the vehicle, which he briefly investigated, but, he then chose to continue his journey along the motorway. Expert evidence establishes that vehicle was travelling at no more than 5.5mph at the time of impact. 'In the face of overwhelming evidence, James Johnson pleaded guilty on 29 September to causing death by dangerous driving. 'I hope the sentence handed down today will bring some comfort to Bethany's family and friends, and to all those who were injured in this tragic incident.' A DVLA spokeswoman said: 'Britain has some of the safest roads in the world and licensing rules play an important part in keeping our roads safe. 'The rules are clear - all drivers must ensure that they are medically fit to drive and must notify DVLA of the onset or worsening of a medical condition affecting this.'","Bethany Jones, 18, died in April last year while travelling to hen party .

"Jessica Ennis-Hill was last night threatened with rape by online trolls after she said she would cut her ties with Sheffield United if they re-signed convicted rapist Ched Evans. The football club has named a stand after the Olympic champion – but she said she would want it renamed if Evans was given a contract. One tweet read: ‘Jessica Ennis-Hill is a stupid c***. Saying she will remove her name if Ched Evens (sic) is signed. I hope he rapes her.’ Scroll down for video . Jessica Ennis-Hill, 27, has received threats to rape her on Twitter after she said she wanted her name removed from a stand at Sheffield United if Ched Evans, who was convicted of rape, is re-signed by the club . Another user tweeted the sportswoman, saying: ‘Hope Ched Evans gets you you little slut’ – before describing the insult as ‘a bit of banter’. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, the Sheffield Hallam MP, condemned the threats, tweeting: ‘Rape threats against @J-Ennis are sick and vile. This is totally out of order.’ The abuse comes just weeks after Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan’s daughter, Chloe, was threatened with rape over the issue. The threat was made after Judy Finnigan said on TV that Evans should be able to return to his club because the victim was ‘drunk’ and the rape was ‘unpleasant’ but ‘not violent’. She was forced to apologise after widespread criticism. Last night, South Yorkshire Police confirmed they were investigating the threatening tweets. Ennis-Hill was honoured by her local team after winning gold in the heptathlon at the 2012 Games but has now said she would sever the links if it hands a contract to Evans, who is set to train with the squad. Richard Madeley and Judy Finnegan's daughter Chloe was also threatened with rape over the same issue . Her withdrawal of support could now be the death knell to any attempt by the Yorkshire club to allow Evans to relaunch his career. In a statement, Ennis-Hill, 28, said: ‘I believe being a role model to young people is a huge honour and those in positions of influence in communities should respect the role they play in young people’s lives and set a good example. ‘If Evans was to be re-signed by the club it would completely contradict these beliefs.’ She was backed by David Cameron yesterday. He told reporters at the G20 summit in Brisbane: ‘I quite understand why she’s said what she’s said and done what’s she done.’ Tweets saying they hoped the Olympic heptathlete would be raped by Evans are being investigated by police . The troll reacted angrily after receiving criticism of his threat, before he deleted his Twitter account . Jessica Ennis, pictured, was told by one Twitter troll that she hoped she would be 'raped by Ched' The attack on Ennis-Hill came after FA chairman Greg Dyke said the row over whether Evans, 25, should play football again was ‘not an important issue’. Mr Dyke, 67, appeared on BBC’s Newsnight on Thursday to discuss a report alleging corruption over England’s World Cup bid. But asked about Evans, Mr Dyke said: It’s a dilemma and it’s not clear cut.’ Asked where he stood, Mr Dyke blustered: ‘It’s not an important issue … err … is an important issue but not in terms of what we, we’re here, and what you asked me to come on and talk about.’ One tweet, posted by the official account of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: ‘Greg Dyke: football corruption is an important issue, rape isn’t.’ Football fan, Josh Lennon, said: ‘To not have a properly formed opinion over one of the most contentious stories around football this week is simply idiotic.’ Evans was released from jail after serving two and a half years of a five-year sentence for raping a teenager at a hotel in 2011. An appeal against his conviction was rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in 2012, but his case is due to be looked at by the Criminal Cases Review Commission.

"Once they delighted children with pictures of angels, stars and donkeys, but Advent calendars have now departed so far from tradition that one from Ann Summers even features a naked man posing under a Christmas tree. Now a Christian website – dismayed by the proliferation of such secular themes – is urging readers to vote for the ‘Badvent’ calendar of the year. In a tongue-in-cheek competition aimed at highlighting the lack of calendars using images from the Bible, the Ship Of Fools website has selected eight of the worst offenders. The Ship of Fools Christian website is urging its readers to vote for the 'Badvent' calendar of the year, which could be this racy Ann Summers naked man Advent Calendar . A very merry Christmas indeed: This Advent calendar comes with 24 different whiskies and costs £149.95 . The most pricey – at £149.95 on Amazon – is the Drinks By The Dram: The Whisky Advent Calendar, in which miniature bottles of different brands are hidden behind the windows. The Ship Of Fools editors comment on their website: ‘Forget gold, frankincense and myrrh. Why didn’t the wise men turn up with 24 different whiskies?’ There is also a calendar offering chocolates in ‘different music designs’ that shows a red-faced Father Christmas making a vulgar two-fingered gesture while his boot rests on a skull, under a sign reading ‘Live loud!’. The Barbie Advent calendar, on sale online from £17.97, offers a new fashion accessory for every day. In a similar vein, the fashion brand Ciate has a 24-piece mini nail polish collection for the run-up to Christmas, priced at £49.99. The Ship Of Fools editors said: ‘To think Mary could have whiled away the hours on the back of that donkey glamming up a bit for Bethlehem.’ Lego has a Star Wars-themed calendar, while others feature ‘Eric the Elephant’ or dog treats. But the most provocative is Ann Summers’ Naughty Advent Calendar, showing a nude male model leaning on a decorated Christmas tree with a strategically-placed present to cover his modesty. This Barbie advent calendar comes with a different fashion accessory behind every window, including necklaces, bangles, earrings and purses . Death Star of Bethlehem: Darth Vader dresses as Father Christmas in this LEGO Star Wars Advent Calendar .

"Arsene Wenger is facing a striker crisis ahead of Thursday's clash against Southampton after Danny Welbeck picked up a thigh problem. With Olivier Giroud suspended, Welbeck was a certainty to play in the lone striker role on New Year’s Day. But the England forward is a doubt for the trip to St Mary’s, meaning Wenger could be without a recognised striker. Danny Welbeck is doubtful for Arsenal's trip to Southampton after picking up a thigh injury . Olivier Giroud is also suspended for the Gunners leaving Arsenal with a striking crisis ahead of trip . Arsene Wenger is facing somewhat of a striking crisis ahead of Arsenal's trip to St Mary's Stadium . Wenger confirmed: ‘We have one alert after the game at West Ham and that’s Danny Welbeck, he could be short for Thursday.’ Lukas Podolski looks to be the favourite to play in the striker role if Welbeck fails to prove his fitness, with Theo Walcott only just returning from injury. And Wenger, who also revealed Aaron Ramsey will not be fit for the trip, has slammed Inter Milan for their offer to sign Podolski. The Serie A club want to take the Germany international on loan until the end of the season when the transfer window re-opens tomorrow. Lukas Podolski, who is wanted by Inter Milan, is the favourite to fill in up front for Arsenal on Thursday . Welbeck (left) would have played in the central role had he not sustained his thigh injury . Inter want to pay a £1.5million loan fee, but Wenger laughed off the Italians’ offer, saying: ‘That is a joke, Inter Milan are not serious. ‘He’s a player of Arsenal Football Club and I want him to stay.’ However, Wenger did hint that he could allow Yaya Sanogo to leave on loan in January, admitting that a deal was ‘not impossible.’ Theo Walcott has only just returned from injury so will not be thrust into the central striker role . Yaya Sanogo (right) could leave on loan in January, with Wenger admitting it is 'not impossible' Wenger also called on the football authorities to ban players who have been exposed as divers. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho this week claimed there was a campaign to paint his players as divers after Cesc Fabregas was booked for simulation, and Wenger said: ‘I’m against diving. We should punish after the game. ‘The problem will be to decide when it was obvious diving or not. That’s a big issue and sometimes it’s not obvious. We should punish only obvious cases.’ Wenger also believes diving should be punished harshly and that would stop incidents like Cesc Fabregas getting booked unfairly, as he did against Southampton on Sunday .

"The ban was introduced in case girls damaged the vehicles they were working on, leading to the possibility of compensation claims . Britain's Girl Guides are at the centre of a sexism row after being told they can no longer wash cars to raise funds. The ban was introduced in case girls damaged the vehicles they were working on, leading to the possibility of compensation claims against the organisation. But Scouts are still encouraged to clean vehicles in return for payment, as they have done for decades. Former Guides expressed their surprise at the decision, saying there should be no distinction between the sexes. TV presenter Sue Cook said: ‘I’m amazed to hear that car washing is prohibited for Guides. I can’t think what the rationale for that can be in this day and age. My daughter earned money in the school holidays as a young teenager by car washing. If it’s OK for the boys, how can it not be OK for the girls?’ The Guides’ website lists other activities in which its members cannot participate – even though Scouts can – such as bungee jumping, paint-balling and laser games. It even says the 550,000 members of the Girlguiding organisation, whose motto is Be Prepared, should not be involved in shooting at human or animal-shaped targets, and includes a veto on fights with water pistols. The website states that the banned activities are deemed to be either too dangerous or go against the spirit of the organisation. Under a section headed Car Washing: Prohibited Activity, it says the ban is ‘due to the insurance implications to Girlguiding regarding the possible damage to vehicles.’ The Guides declined to comment in more detail, despite repeated approaches by The Mail on Sunday for more information. Girlguiding spokesman Kim Sanders said: ‘We don’t allow car washing for purely insurance reasons. Thousands of girls and women take part in a variety of activities in Guiding safely every year.’ Scroll down for video . Girlguiding organisation, whose motto is Be Prepared, also includes a veto on fights with water pistols . Ironically, the insurance the Scouts have does allow them to clean cars – even though a quarter of their members are now girls. Unity Insurance does admit on its website, however, that it has faced claims from ‘irate’ drivers. The company says that in some cases, Scouts have been to blame for causing damage, citing one occasion when ‘a bucket of water was placed on the bonnet of a car and pushed across the shiny surface’. Yesterday, Scout leader Chris Foster, who works with youngsters in North London, said: ‘Car washing is one of our main fundraising events and will help pay for us to go to the Scout jamboree in Japan next year. We identify activities that young people want to do and whether it is appropriate to do them. ‘It’s a case of learning life qualities. We might get the Cub Scouts to do the wheels and tyres, as that’s what they can reach and do safely. The older Scouts would do the bodywork because they are able to focus more and are taller. ‘Our organisation is becoming very popular with girls because of all the exciting activities we do.’ Part of the membership fees for the Scouts (£21 a year) and the Guides (£11.80 a year) goes towards paying the annual insurance premiums for their activities. The Guides were founded in 1910 after a group of girls gatecrashed a Scouts rally and begged the founder of the organisation, Lord Baden-Powell, to let them set up their own, similar, movement. Those aged 15 years and over have been allowed to join the Scouts since 1976, while girls of any age have been welcomed since 1990.","Ban introduced in case girls damaged the vehicles they were working on .

"An autopsy report has revealed that the death of Jimi Jamison, the lead singer of 1980s rock band Survivor, was partly caused by methamphetamine use. Jamison died on September 1 aged 63 at a home in Memphis, Tennessee, according to the report released by the Shelby County medical on Tuesday. It had originally been reported that Jamison – who sang on Survivor hits such as Burning Heart and Is This Love - died of a heart attack. An autopsy report has revealed that the death of Jimi Jamison, the lead singer of 1980s rock band Survivor, was partly caused by methamphetamine use . The autopsy says Jamison had cardiovascular disease and narrowing of the arteries. The report says he died of a hemorrhagic brain stroke, with ‘acute methamphetamine intoxication contributing.’ Because meth was determined to be a contributor, and the circumstances leading up to the death were not suspicious, the coroner ruled Jamison's death as an accident. The singer and songwriter joined Survivor in 1984, after the band had already become known for Eye of the Tiger, the theme song to the Sylvester Stallone film Rocky III. The singer and songwriter joined Survivor in 1984, after the band had already become known for Eye of the Tiger, although he sang on Burning Heart from Rocky IV . After Jamison replaced vocalist Dave Bickler, the band had several more hits and recorded three more albums until they disbanded in 1989. The group reformed in 1993 with Bickler as lead singer, but Jamison eventually rejoined Survivor also and they remained a popular touring act in recent years. Jamison, who also was a member of Target and Cobra, also co-wrote and sang I'm Always Here, the theme to Baywatch.

"Traces of deodorant, perfume and soap left behind at crime scenes could soon be used by police to help trap criminals. Forensics experts are building chemical profiles of popular fragrances to help them identify scents left on clothing and items touched by offenders. They hope that by building up a 'scent profile' of the person behind a crime, it can help to narrow down lists of suspects and even be used as evidence in court. Forensics experts are building chemical profiles of popular fragrances in a lab (pictured) to help them identify scents left on clothing and items touched by offenders. They hope that by building up a 'scent profile' of the person behind a crime, it can help to narrow down lists of suspects and even be used as evidence in court . Alison Davidson, a researcher at Staffordshire University's department of forensic and crime science, is leading the work in the hope that it can be used by police forensics teams. She said: 'Suspects can be smothered in fragrance and I am trying to find chemicals that can give some extra information. 'You can get quite a complex mixture of different personal care products that can be used together to narrow down a list of suspects or build up a picture of a perpetrator. 'For example, Chanel No 5 is famous for using a particular aldehyde, so if I can see components that are typical of Chanel it might be possible to say a suspect comes from a certain socio-economic background. Similarly Lynx tends to be used by younger men. Experts from Staffordshire University said there is a complex mixture of different personal care products that can be used together to narrow down a list of suspects. For example, Chanel No 5 (left) uses a particular aldehyde and could reveal details of a person's background.Lynx (right) tends to be used by younger men . Lead researcher Alison Davidson said: 'Scent evidence is never going to be as robust as DNA evidence, but you can get something a lot quicker and cheaper than you can with DNA. Used together with other forensic methods it can be another piece of evidence in the puzzle - it is another tool in the toolbox' 'If we were to see some Gillette fragrances in there too, for example, then we can start to unpick a bit about who they are.' Mrs Davidson, who presented her findings to a recent meeting of the International Fragrance Association UK Fragrance Forum, is attempting to develop the technique so it can be submitted as robust evidence in court. She said samples of scents can be easily gathered from the clothing of victims or from swabs taken off hard surfaces. These can then be analysed in the laboratory for chemical signatures that match those found in beauty and personal hygiene products. Sniffer dogs have been used by police in criminal investigations for decades and are often able to identify individuals from their scent even if they have changed soaps. Forensic scientists have been attempting to replicate this by using electronic equipment that can analyse the chemical components of an odour. They hope that by identify key compounds from the sweat left behind by criminals, it can be used as evidence against them. They also hope that chemical markers in the sweat could also be used to build up lifestyle profiles of suspects, indicating whether they smoke, their diet, sex and even emotional state. Professor Richard Brereton, from Bristol University's Centre for Chemometrics, has been helping to develop a way of identifying individuals from their scent by looking at 44 compounds secreted by the human body. Another team at the University of Pennsylvania,  working with Lockheed Martin, has developed a new technique for analysing odour given off in sweat, that they hope will lead to handheld devices. 'I am concentrating on what compounds we can detect and what might be significant,' she continued. 'Ultimately I am not really interested in whether the samples we get actually smell or not - I'm looking for the chemical patterns to see if they can be matched with anything.

"It's the last place on Earth you would want to play football. But in 1915, while staring death in the face, British troops from the London Irish Rifles passed this ball between them as they courageously charged across No Man's Land under heavy fire. The tattered brown ball ended up in German trenches following the successful but bloody attack at the Battle of Loos - and a century later it has been valued at £15,000 on the Antiques Roadshow. Incredible: This ball was kicked across No Man's Land by British soldiers under heavy machine-gun and mortar fire during the Battle of Loos in the First World War . The ball was one of six that soldiers had planned to dribble across the battlefield in a show of British bravado - and utter madness. But the night before the offensive their commanding officer rumbled them - and  shot five of the balls rendering them useless. The one that survived belonged to Sergeant Frank Edwards who hid it from his commanding officer by stuffing it up his tunic moments before going into battle. He booted the ball into No Man's Land where men from the London Irish Rifles fanned out like a line of forwards - passing it between themselves while being bombarded with mortar and machine-gun fire. Hid the ball: Sergeant Frank Edwards, right, with one of his brothers, and pictured with London Irish Rifles . Sergeant Edwards was shot and wounded, and after bouncing into German trenches, the ball was later found wedged in barbed wire and taken back to headquarters. The ball is on display at the London Irish Rifles Association museum but has been lent to Sergeant Edwards' granddaughter, Sue Harris, who took it to the Antiques Roadshow's First World War special programme to be broadcast this Sunday. Mrs Harris also presents expert Graham Lay with a bronze statue of her grandfather dressed in uniform holding the ball along with a watercolour painting of the extraordinary charge. Post-battle: British troops returning from the line after the Battle of Loos, pictured in Belgium in 1915 . Proud: Graham Lay Antiques Roadshow specialist with Frank's granddaughter, Sue Harris. Mr Lay values the ball at between £10,000 and £15,000 and tells Mrs Harris: 'You haven't just got a football here, the football is testament to the bravery, the courage and the morale of your grandfather.' The Battle of Loos took place on September 25, 1915. The Battle of Loos was the largest British offensive mounted in 1915 on the Western Front during World War I. The first British use of poison gas occurred and the battle was the first mass engagement of New Army units. Date: September 25 – October 14 1915. Location: Loos, France . British commanders: Field Marshal Douglas Haig and Field Marshal Sir John French. British casualties: 50,000 casualties (with at least 20,000 deaths). German casualties: Approximately 25,000. Bloodiest day: On September 28 around 8,000 British troops were killed in the space of four hours during an attack on well-defended German positions. The regiment's football team hatched their plan to dribble six balls across No Man's Land as they thought it would help distract them from the deadly mission while also shocking the enemy. Sergeant Edwards is said to have dribbled the ball 20 yards before he was shot in the thigh. One of his footballing comrades applied a tourniquet to the wound which saved his life. The injury ended his war and he was discharged from the London Irish Rifles in 1919 and joined the Military Foot Police. But his name went down in army folklore and he was known as the 'footballer of Loos'. A pub in his home town of Twickenham, south west London, was named The Rifleman in his honour. Mrs Harris said: 'I knew my grandfather until I was ten, he lived with us.. He was a kind man, tall and upright but he never talked to me about the war or to my mother but we knew the story. 'I think he was feeling absolute terror. I think he thought about blocking that out by kicking the ball with his pals. 'I was very possessive of my grandfather, he was the footballer of Loos.' Iconic: Photo from the 1923 London Irish Old comrades dinner showing the historic ball . The ball was previously displayed at the regimental museum in Camberwell, south east London, until 50 years ago. After that it languished in a container in the sergeant's mess at the museum for the next five decades and in 2011 resurfaced in a decrepit state and in danger of perishing into a pile of dust. Conservation experts were called in and after painstaking restoration, the ball was returned to its former glory. Tribute: A bronze statue of Francis 'Frank' Edwards posed during the football match at the Battle of Loos . Corageous: A painting from the football match that occurred at the Battle of Loos . The 1st Battalion of the London Irish Rifles was sent to the Western Front in May 1915 and took part in the first major British offensive of the war in September. During the ball's restoration, Nigel Wilkinson, vice-chairman of the London Irish Rifles Regimental Association, explained: 'The London Irish had a first class football team and they were keen to score a goal in Jerry's front line trenches. 'One of the platoon commanders thought this was a bad idea and just before the whistles blew for the attack he went round puncturing all those that he could find.'

"Stoke boss Mark Hughes has revealed he plans to save the club's transfer funds for the summer rather than splash out in the January window. Consecutive victories over Everton and West Brom have seen the Potters climb to 11th in the table ahead of Thursday's home match against Manchester United. Hughes' side are only six points off a place in the top six but the Stoke manager insists he will resist the temptation to make any major signings next month. Mame Biram Diouf scores the opening goal of the game between Stoke City and West Bromwich Albion . Mark Hughes plans for quiet January as he saves transfer money to invest in next summer . 'We might look at the loan market but we're not close to anything really at the moment,' Hughes said. 'I wouldn't have thought we'll be spending anything significant in the January window. 'We're better served keeping what finances we have available ready to go into the market in the summer. I think that would be our best policy.' Stoke's 2-0 win over West Brom on Sunday saw the team register back-to-back clean sheets in the league for the first time this season. Diouf tumbles to the ground in celebration while strike partner Peter Crouch runs over to join him . Diouf adds a second goal of the afternoon to effectively end the contest at the Britannia Stadium . Asmir Begovic and Ryan Shawcross have been two of the Potters' star performers at the back this term but Hughes insists he is not expecting any bids for the duo next month. 'There's speculation about the best players at most clubs and the two you mentioned are in that bracket from our point of view,' Hughes said. 'We're not encouraging any bids on any of our players and that won't change in January and it won't change in the summer. 'Other clubs might have something to say about that and they may be persistent but we've had no bids for those two players up to this point and I don't anticipate we will have bids in the January window either.' Marko Arnautovic (left), Bojan Krkic (centre) and Crouch (back right) gather round to congratulate Diouf . Begovic's current contract has 18 months left to run and Stoke are trying to persuade the Bosnian stopper to extend his deal amid reported interest from Liverpool. 'There are discussions but I don't think it's progressed further than that,' Hughes said. 'There's no real timescale but the closer the contract comes to running down the more the power shifts away from us as a club and closer to the player and his representatives.' Bojan scored from the spot as Stoke beat Everton 1-0 at Goodison Park on Boxing Day . Bojan celebrates after netting the only goal of the game from the spot . Hughes' stand-out summer signing Bojan Krkic is a major doubt for the game against United on New Year's Day with a hamstring injury he suffered against West Brom. The 24-year-old underwent a scan on Tuesday to diagnose the extent of the problem and Hughes admits the forward's absence is a blow. 'He is a major doubt for the game,' Hughes aid. 'It's a real disappointment because he's been doing so well for us but we've got good players waiting to come in and have an impact.'","Stoke have moved up to 11th with back-to-back Premier League victories .

The data is often made up of coordinates like latitude and longitude, and may also include bearing, altitude, distance and place names. It is most commonly used for photographs and can help people get a lot of specific information about where the picture was taken or the exact location of a friend who logged on to a service. There are a number of privacy issues around geotagging - particularly when third party apps automatically make use of it without notifying the user. Currently, there are 15 million images tagged with the word 'cat' on public image hosting sites, and daily thousands more are uploaded from unlimited positions on the globe. Professor Mundy used photos that were tagged 'cat' from Flickr, Instagram, and several other image hosting sites, then he scrubbed the metadata from it. This means that the results you see on the map are anonymous, and there is no way of identifying the original account it came from. ‘With an estimated 7.8 metres accuracy, if you took a photo of your cat in your home you might find it near that location on the map,’ Professor Mundy said.

"A newspaper has been forced to apologise for publishing a cartoon that showed a Jewish man   watching the bombing of Gaza from his armchair to accompany a column about the Middle East crisis. The Sydney Morning Herald was slammed by the Attorney-General and the Jewish community for using the drawing of an old man seated in an armchair emblazoned with the Star of David, watching comfortably from a hill as bombs dropped on Gaza. The paper's Editor-in-Chief Darren Goodsir on Monday said it was a 'serious error of judgement' when they published the cartoon drawn by Glen Le Lievre on July 26. Scroll down for video . The Sydney Morning Herald has apologised after publishing this cartoon by Glen Le Lievre alongside a column about the conflict in Gaza . 'The Herald now appreciates that, in using the Star of David and the kippah in the cartoon, the newspaper invoked an inappropriate element of religion, rather than nationhood, and made a serious error of judgment. 'It was wrong to publish the cartoon in its original form,' Mr Goodsir wrote. His apology came after the Attorney-General George Brandis reportedly accused Fairfax Media of publishing anti-Semitic commentary on the Middle East. 'I thought the cartoon was deplorable,' Senator Brandis told The Australian. The Sydney Morning Herald said the cartoon was based on real life photographs that showed men seated in chairs 'observing the shelling of Gaza from the hills of Sderot'. The column's writer Mike Carlton tweeted examples of such photographs on Monday. 'The cartoon had its genesis in news photographs of men seated in chairs and lounges, observing the shelling of Gaza from the hills of Sderot,' Sydney Morning Herald Editor-in-Chief Darren Goodsir said on Monday . The cartoon was reportedly based on the Israelis (pictured) who stood on a hill at the Israeli town of Sderot, overlooking the Gaza Strip, as they watched smoke rising following an Israeli strike on Gaza, on July 12 . 'It was wrong to publish the cartoon in its original form. We apologise unreservedly for this lapse, and the anguish and distress that has been caused,' the Herald's apology continued. Carlton told Daily Mail Australia on Monday that although he does not wish to comment on the cartoon that was used to illustrate his column, he stands by every word that he wrote. 'It is not anti-Semitic to criticise Israel. Just this morning the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon,  condemned an Israeli air strike on a school as a ""moral outrage and a criminal act"". 'While I have been fiercely slandered by the Jewish community, I have received overwhelming majority support from the wider Herald readership,' he said. Sydney Morning Herald columnist Mike Carlton says he has been 'fiercely slandered by the Jewish community' over his column . The columnist received a huge reactionto his strongly-worded column on July 26 . In his strongly-worded article, which came as a reaction to the death of hundreds of Palestinians, Carlton said Israel 'is waging its own war of terror on the entire Gaza population of about 1.7 million people. Call it genocide, call it ethnic cleansing: the aim is to kill Arabs'. He said he believed that the Israeli response to attacks from Hamas 'has been out of all proportion, a monstrous distortion of the much-vaunted right of self defence'. However, the Australian Jewish News website criticised Carlton's column, calling it 'insidious'. 'This column was no longer about a country, this was about a people and a race,' the editorial said. 'How low can a columnist in a mainstream newspaper sink? How low can a mainstream newspaper sink?,' it asked. The Sydney Morning Herald's apology came on the same day as an apology was demanded from The Australian newspaper for a Palestinian cartoon by Bill Leak that they ran on 31 July. The former Anglican bishop of Canberra and current APAN president George Browning told Crikey the cartoon 'expresses not the slightest sympathy for those whose children have been killed in Gaza'. The illustration shows a member of Hamas rather than a normal Palestinian, The Australian's Editor-in-Chief Chris Mitchell said as he defended it. The cartoon shows a man in military gear with a gun, patting a child on the head and saying 'there! Now you go out to play and win the PR war for daddy'.

"Arsenal teenage prodigy Gedion Zelalem has boosted the future of American soccer by gaining U.S. citizenship. The 17-year-old, who has featured once in the Arsenal first-team this season, was born in Ethiopia but spent a majority of his childhood in the States before moving to London to pursue his career with the Gunners.

At his request we have started the FIFA process which would allow him to be eligible for the #USMNT.'

Zelalem played one FA Cup match for the Gunners last season and played in the 4-1 Champions League win at Galatasaray earlier this month as Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger holds the midfielder in high regard for the future. 'He is a player with a good eye and good technique and is very agile. He has the ambition to find the ball on the field. So he's the kind of player who could be of use to the United States,' Wenger told Sports Illustrated back in July . 'He's in some ways the type of player the US was missing in the World Cup.' However the 17-year-old could still choose to represent Germany, who he played for at youth level, and needs FIFA to approve his application but his intentions seem to lie with the USA.

"The United States has renewed airstrikes against a terrorist group in Syria a month after a high ranking official went on a national news program to warn the public that they pose an imminent threat to the country. According to a report, the U.S. conducted five airstrikes on Wednesday night that targeted senior leaders of the Khorasan group. The Pentagon could not confirm the strikes, but said it had seen the reports. Scroll down for videos .

Foreign Policy spoke with a defense official who said the attacks used both manned and unmanned aircraft and were conducted in the town of Sarmada. These airstrikes come a month after FBI Director James Comey appeared on 60 Minutes and described the Khorasan as 'serious people, bent on destruction.' He went on to warn people, saying the group would likely strike in this country 'very, very soon.' The United States previously launched an airstrike against the group in September, but failed to take out any high ranking officials. Some claim this was because they were previously tipped off by news reports. Imminent threat: The attacks on the Khorasan group (as seen in September above) are crucial according to FBI director James Comey, who said they could attack U.S. 'very, very soon' Not only did these men manage to escape, but they were also able to take with them many of the high-tech explosive devices they plan to use for their own attacks.

"A gang who stole a fleet of expensive, high-performance cars from some of London’s wealthiest residents were caught out after posting pictures on Facebook - including one showing a member eating a ‘cash’ sandwich. The eight men stole nine cars - including BMWs, Range Rovers, Porsches and a £100,000 Mercedes - as well as jewellery, phones and laptops in 15 separate burglaries. Detectives finally caught up with the them after one of the gang members posted a picture of himself sat on the bonnet of a stolen black Range Rover on Facebook. One of the gang, Conor Murphy, posted a picture of himself on Facebook eating a 'Cash Sandwich'. The pictures would eventually lead police to catch the gang . Rory Mason, 18, poses with cash. He denied involvement in the plot to steal the cars but was found guilty by a jury . Two other members of the gang, Niah George and Kalan Williamson were pictured with a stolen Mercedes AMG C63 sports car worth £100,000 . That picture led police to discover a number of other incriminating images on the social network site and on the phones of the group, which showed them boasting about their wealth. They showed the men sitting in the stolen cars, drinking champagne, wearing Rolex and Cartier watches and posing with huge piles of £20 and £50 notes. In one of the pictures Conor Murphy, 19, is seen about to take a bite into a hundreds of pounds worth of notes sandwiched between two slices of bread. Police also found video footage on their phones that showed them racing the cars they’d stolen and bragging about what other motors they had their eye on. Blackberry messages used by the gang to arrange burglaries were also discovered. Seven of the men pleaded guilty to the burglaries earlier this year. Another man, Rory Mason, 18, denied any involvment in the plot to steal the cars but was found guilty by a jury last month. Isleworth Crown Court heard how the men focussed their attention on houses where valuable cars were kept. Between April and September last year they broke into homes in Notting Hill, Kensington and Kensal Green and stole nine cars, as well as electrical goods and jewellery. The gang snapped pictures of their hauls including large amounts of cash, designer watches and mobile phones . Cash rich: Rory Mason, from the gang, pictured with a large pile of £50 notes . Connor Murphy, 19, was another who allowed a photo of himself holding a  large pile of cash on social media websites . Mark Paltenghi, prosecuting, said: 'It seems quite plain from looking at the evidence that the principal, but not sole aim, was to target houses where valuable cars were kept. Car keys were stolen from the houses and the cars were driven away.' Kalan Williams, 20, described as the ‘principal conspirator’, pleaded guilty to 11 of the burglaries. Footage from a police helicopter showing Williams running away from officers and dropping the key to a stolen Land Rover Discovery was used in court. During their investigation, detectives found a picture taken from Williams’ phone which showed him holding three sets of keys to three vehicles. Two - a BMW and an Audi - were confirmed as having been stolen, while the other was an unknown car. Mr Paltenghi told the court: 'You may not be surprised to see Williams holding three sets of keys, we suggest for three stolen vehicles - a BMW, an Audi and another. You may have no trouble concluding that this is a young man flaunting and boasting about his prowess as a domestic burglar.'Another photograph found on Williams’ phone shows him sitting on a Porsche 911, which police later discovered was stolen from a house in Stamford Brook on July 26. A BMW was stolen from the same house that night and police discovered video footage of Williams, Murphy, Niah George, 18, Akin Ford and Jonathan Oriba, both 20, racing the cars around the streets of west London at high speeds. The men were seen passing a phone between cars as the filmed themselves. Rory Mason smirks as he is arrested by police as part of Operation Decker in September 2012 . The teenager, wearing a grey tracksuit, bows his head but appears to smile as he is led away by police . The crimes, which took place during one nine-month spree were obviously very lucrative for the gang . The gang's downfall was posting pictures of their ill-gotten gains on Facebook . The gang were responsible for stealing a haul of cars worth hundreds of thousands over the space of five months. These included a Porsche 911, Porsche Caymen, Mercedes AMG C63, Land Rover Discovery, two BMW 6 series, Range Rover Sport, Audi Q5 and a VW Golf. The white Mercedes was believed to be the gang’s ‘trophy car’. Many of the photos seized by police showed the men posing beside the £100,000 high-performance motor. Even when the car was recovered by police and returned to its owner, the brazen group, who had kept the key, tried again to steal it only to find it had been reprogrammed. Their attempts were caught on CCTV and the owner of the car was seen chasing the thieves away in his boxer shorts. In September three of the men, Williams, Murphy and Daniel Talbot, 23, tried to steal a Maserati and a laptop from a home in Notting Hill but ran off empty handed after they were disturbed by the owner. The men were arrested after a series of dawn raids as part of the intelligence-led Operation Decker.Mason, of north Kensington, denied one count of conspiracy to commit a dwelling house burglary but was found guilty after a week-long trial. Kalan Williamson, from Chelsea, Conor Murphy, 19, north Kensington, Niah George, 18, from Hammersmith, Jonathan Oriba, 20, from Notting Hill, Akil Ford, 20, from Clapham, Daniel Talbot, 23, from north Kensington and Yassin Imlahi, 19, from Kensington, all pleaded guilty to the same charge. Kalan Williamson was jailed for four years and eight months, Conor Murphy was handed a four year detention for conspiracy and eight months for dangerous driving.

Akil Ford, who had 24 previous convictions, got four years detention, while Daniel Talbot was jailed for four years. Yassin Imlahi got three years detention, as did Rory Mason, who was found guilty by a jury after denying his involvement. Speaking after the sentencing, DI Craig Leonard, from the pro-active unit at Kensington Police Station, said: 'Months and months of hard work have finally come to fruition. These eight were a group of young lads, who were good at what they did. But their downfall was that they were stupid. 'They posted pictures of their loot on Facebook and sent messages to each other using Blackberry Messenger planning their crimes. They were brazen about their crimes but this eventually led to their downfall. 'These were men who were wrapped up in their own world and driven by by greed and the gangster lifestyle. If an opportunity arose, they would go for it. They were going into properties regardless of people being in or not.

"A study by Carroll University, Wisconsin found that cat owners (stock image) scored more highly on an intelligence test than dog owners . Pet owners have long fought like cats and dogs about whether felines or canines make the best furry companions. But now a new study claims that cat owners are smarter than dog owners – regardless of their pet's intelligence. The research revealed that the owners of the two animals tend to have different personalities - with cat lovers being more sensitive and open-minded than dog lovers who are largely energetic. A study by Carroll University, Wisconsin found that cat owners scored more highly on an intelligence test than dog owners. Dog lovers tend to be more energetic and outgoing than cat owners and follow rules more obediently, Live Science reported. Speaking at the annual Association for Psychological Science meeting in Chicago, psychology professor Denise Guastello said that cat owners are more introverted, sensitive and open-minded than dog people. They also tend to be better at breaking rules. She thinks that the reason for these differences if the types of environment that cat and dog owners are drawn to. ‘It makes sense that a dog person is . going to be more lively, because they're going to want to be out there, . outside, talking to people, bringing their dog. Man's best friend: Dog lovers tend to be more energetic and outgoing than cat owners but follow rules more obediently, according to a new study, which also revealed that cat owners tend to be introverted . Statistics gathered by crowdfunding site Kickstarter, have revealed that people are more attracted to businesses and products relating to dogs, than cats. As of April this year, the total amount of projects launched relating to dogs was 735, compared to 459 to do with cats. Dog products attracted $3,579,495 of funding, while cats pulled in $2,212,423. However, cat projects so far have a higher success rate than dog-related projects at 44 per cent and 39 per cent respectively and cat projects attract a higher number of average backers per project over-all. ‘Whereas, if you're more introverted and sensitive, maybe you're more at home reading a book and your cat doesn't need to go outside for a walk.’ A total of 600 students took a survey to reveal their personality traits and were asked whether they are cat or dog lovers. Around 60 per cent of people identified themselves as 'dog people' – around six times as many as the number of students who said they love cats. Around a third of those questioned claimed they liked or disliked both animals equally. Professor Guastello thinks that people might select a pet based on their own personality so that energetic people are attracted to energetic pets, like dogs. While the study might seem like a bit of fun, the findings could be used to improve the effectiveness of pet therapy in order to make better matches between pets and people. Not top dog? The psychologist thinks that the reason for the personality differences between dog and cat lovers is the types of environment that they owners are drawn to. Pet owners have long disagreed over whether felines are canies (pictured) make the best pets .","A study by Carroll University, Wisconsin found that cat owners scored more highly on an intelligence test than dog owners and are more sensitive too .

He will add more good competition to our squad, which is very healthy for the group. 'He already knows a number of our players from his time with Manchester United and he is the kind of character we look for, so I'm sure he will settle in quickly.' And Simpson commented: 'I'm really excited. I've had a look around the facilities, which look fantastic, and had a good chat with the manager, who I'm really looking forward to working with. 'He told me that there's a good group of players here that demand a lot of each other and I think, from speaking to other people, he knows I'll work hard every day to fit into that. I've got a really good feeling about this.' Nigel Pearson's Leicester team have conceded four goals in their first two league games, and it is hoped Simpson will help to shore things up at the back.

The striker, who has been released to join up with the France squad ahead of their fixtures with Spain and Switzerland next week, had an £8m-release clause in his contract which both Arsenal and Chelsea matched. Chelsea became aware of Arsenal's interest late on Saturday but had done enough to tie up the deal, having started talks in earnest on Friday once Fernando Torres joined AC Milan on loan. Arsenal made late a check on Loic Remy's transfer status ahead of tomorrow's transfer deadline. The QPR striker has completed a move to Chelsea, but the Gunners enquired to see on how far his move to Stamford Bridge is down the line. But it is understood the North London club were told that his move to Chelsea was virtually complete meaning Arsene Wenger will have to look elsewhere for a new forward.

"Vice President Joe Biden is saluting military veterans, calling them not only the 'heart and soul,' but the 'spine of the nation.' Biden spoke at Arlington National Cemetery, where he participated in a wreath-laying ceremony in honor of Veterans Day. Biden singled out the generation of men and women who joined the armed forces after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, stating that the 3.5 million men and women of that 9/11 military generation made their decision with the near certainty they would be deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan.

He also acknowledged the families of those who serve in his remarks, saying, 'It’s not just the forces on the front line that are asked to sacrifice and to serve. It’s also the families.'

There have actually been 52,168 wounded troops, a difference of 47,000. Perhaps making this misstatement even worse is the fact that immediately before listing these numbers, Biden said, 'Every day for the last six years, I ask my staff early in the morning to contact the Department of Defense to get a detailed report of the number of troops deployed, the number wounded, and the number killed.

"Arsene Wenger insists Joel Campbell will stay at Arsenal after resisting repeated attempts by other clubs to take him on loan. Campbell was a star of Costa Rica's World Cup campaign but is only on the fringe of the Gunners' first team with just one substitute appearance so far this season. With Oliver Giroud sidelined because of a broken tibia until January, Wenger has asked Alexis Sanchez to operate as the lone striker with the inexperienced Yaya Sanogo also filling in. VIDEO Scroll down for Paulo Wanchope: Joel Campbell wants to impress Wenger . No go: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger insists striker Joel Campbell will not leave the club on loan this year . Crisis: Olivier Giroud is out until January and so Campbell is needed as an option up front for Wenger's Gunners . Campbell is an option as well and having spent all three years of his Arsenal career on loan at Lorient, Real Betis and Olympiacos, Wenger views the 22-year-old as part of his plans. 'We've had lots of enquiries and turned them down. There have been plenty of clubs interested, but I don't know how many,' Gunners boss Wenger said. 'Once I say to my assistant he won't go out on loan, even if people ask about him, my assistant doesn't even tell me. When I say no it's no. 'He's definitely a target and a player who is wanted by many clubs.' Speculation over whether Arsenal will sign a new top-level striker before Monday's transfer deadline has dominated the build-up to their Barclays Premier League trip to Leicester on Sunday. Form: Campbell shone during the World Cup for Costa Rica and has been the subject of 'lots of enquiries' Waiting his turn: Campbell has appeared just once off the bench so far in this Premier League season . Wenger has not ruled out acquiring a new forward to replace Giroud, but has stressed it is not essential for the Gunners to be title contenders and will only buy who he believes is the right fit. In contrast, Manchester United have engaged in a late flurry of business by signing Angel di Maria with the arrival of Danny Blind imminent. United have reacted to a dismal start to the season, but Wenger has little sympathy with his old rivals and refuses to discuss a succession plan at Arsenal in light of the slump at Old Trafford following Sir Alex Ferguson's departure. 'Let's be a little patient because Manchester United have just started the season,' Wenger said. 'They will come back and I don't worry too much for them because they have made us suffer enough in the past. Competition: Campbell will be competing with Yaya Sanoga (left) and Alexis Sanchez (right) to play upfront . 'If you look at the names they have in their squad, once it works out they will be a force again in the Premier League.' When asked about how best to introduce his own successor, Wenger replied: 'The ideal world exists only in the imagination of the human being. 'Once you leave a club you want it to go as well as possible. 'That's what Ferguson wanted as well. If it's not working as well as expected, then it's not Ferguson's fault. 'You do well as long as you can. It's competition and cyclical as well. My only focus is to win the next game.'

"A disgraced property tycoon and a hedge fund trader who cashed in on the credit crunch are both in the New Year Honours list. Ex-convict Gerald Ronson – the great survivor of the Guinness share-trading scandal – is made a CBE. And there is a knighthood for Tory donor Paul Ruddock, who has given more than £500,000 to party coffers since 2003. His firm, Lansdowne Partners, made a staggering £100million from the financial crash by betting that the price of Northern Rock shares would fall and also made millions in a matter of days by predicting the likely slide of other banking shares. Controversial: Ex-convict Gerald Ronson, pictured left with wife Gail, is appointed CBE while Tory donor Paul Ruddock, right, is to be knighted . The honours sparked a cross-party war of words, with Labour accusing . David Cameron of cronyism, but Downing Street insisting that the Prime . Minister had nothing to do with the decisions. Michael Dugher, Labour's Shadow Cabinet Office Minister, said: 'David . Cameron promised to clean up politics, but in office he has shown he is . utterly out of touch with decent British people. He is giving a . knighthood to Paul Ruddock, who made millions from the collapse of . Northern Rock and has given over £500,000 to the Tories. 'This tells you everything you need to know about the Tories' priorities. When millions of families are struggling to get by, it's the . Tories' friends in the City who get the rewards.' A member of the Treasury Select Committee, John Mann, described the . knighthood for Mr Ruddock as a 'disgrace'. The Labour MP for Bassetlaw . said: 'The country is sick to death of bankers getting knighthoods from . successive governments. 'It is extraordinary that when there are so many hard working people who . have done a lot for this country, it is people who have caused us so . many problems that are getting awarded. Small business owners who went . under and people who lost their jobs when Northern Rock failed will be . extremely angry.' A Government source stressed that the Prime Minister has no personal . involvement in deciding who receives honours and dismissed any . suggestion of impropriety. The decision, said the source, was taken by . an independent committee in recognition of Mr Ruddock's commitment to . the arts. Donating to a political party is not a bar to an honour but the independent committee is made aware of any donations. Within Government there was anger at Labour's decision to try to make . political capital out of the issue, not least because former Capita boss . Rod Aldridge, who has given Labour £1million, is knighted in today's . list. Jailed: Gerald Ronson, left, during his time inside Ford Prison is the great survivor of the Guinness share-trading scandal . No decision to make: A Government source said that the Prime Minister has no personal involvement in deciding who receives honours . A Government source said: 'This criticism is pretty rich, coming from a . Labour government that gave Fred Goodwin a knighthood – they should wind . their necks in.' Others from the business world whose honours might raise eyebrows . include Denise Coates, founder and chief executive of the online . gambling company bet365. She receives the CBE for services to the . community and business. The daughter of Stoke City FC owner Peter Coates, . she has a £750million fortune and was this year ranked the . eighth-richest woman in the Sunday Times Rich List. Property tycoon and philanthropist Ronson, 72, who was jailed in 1990 . for his part in the Guinness scam, has been honoured for services to . charity. It is rare for a former prisoner to be bestowed with such an . honour. Indeed, one of his co-defendants, the late Jack Lyons, was stripped of . his knighthood after they were convicted along with two other top City . figures. Lyons, who was spared a 30-month term because of his poor . health, was knighted by the 1973 Conservative government and had his title . taken away by John Major. Proud moment: Those people on the New Year Honours list will enjoy a day at Buckingham Palace . Ronson founded Heron Group – now Heron . International Plc – when he was 17, brought self-service petrol stations . to the UK in 1960s and was once the 14th-richest person in Britain and . worth £548million. In 1990 he was, with Lyons, Ernest Saunders and Anthony Parnes, . convicted over Guinness's £2.7billion takeover of the Scottish drinks . group Distillers. The fraud had the effect of boosting the Guinness share price. As it . rose, the group's offer to Distillers' shareholders increased in value, . helping Guinness fend off a bid from rival Argyll and secure the deal. Ronson was convicted of conspiring to create a false market, false . accounting and one of theft. He was fined £5million and sentenced to a . year, but freed after six months for good behaviour. He has always protested his innocence, saying he did not knowingly act dishonestly. A father of four, he is also the uncle of chart-topping musician Mark Ronson. He has raised more than £100million for, and donated more than . £30million to, charities such as the Community Security Trust, NSPCC, . the Prince's Trust and Jewish Care. Asked if Ronson's conviction had any influence over the decision to . award him a CBE, a Cabinet Office spokesman said every nomination for an . honour was considered on its own merits. Other former prisoners to be honoured in the past include footballer . Tony Adams, who was jailed for drink-driving in 1990 and made an MBE 14 . years later. And Mick Jagger was knighted in 2002, 35 years after being . jailed for possessing drugs. The sentence was reduced on appeal to a . conditional discharge. Paul Ruddock, 53, becomes a Knight Bachelor for services to the arts in today's honours list. During the credit crunch in 2007 and 2008 the activities of 'short . sellers' enraged politicians who were trying to shore up plunging bank . shares. Many observers blamed the practice – based on traders selling stock, . allowing the price to fall and then buying it back – for the bailout . funded by taxpayers. Short-sellers were accused of targeting Halifax owner HBOS in particular before it was rescued by Lloyds and then the taxpayer. Mr Ruddock has given £551,598.42 to the Tories since 2003. He is one of . the City's wealthiest men, with a fortune estimated at £280million. Among his philanthropic work, he is chairman of the Victoria and Albert . Museum, for which he has helped raise more than £120million. Delighted: Peter Bazalgette, the man who brought Big Brother to UK screens, has been given a knighthood for services to broadcasting . Peter Bazalgette has the dubious distinction of being the man who brought Big Brother – the epitome of downmarket reality TV – to UK screens. Despite what many will regard as a less than enriching contribution to British life, the media executive has been given a knighthood for services to broadcasting. The 58-year-old was also credited with being instrumental in the rise of lifestyle and make-over shows, having been behind series such as Ground Force, Changing Rooms and Ready Steady Cook. Yesterday Baz, as he is known within the TV industry, said the honour was a ‘delightful compliment’. Bazalgette, great great grandson of civil engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette, oversaw the launch, and several series, of Big Brother for Endemol as well as shows such as Fame Academy, Restoration and Deal Or No Deal. While he did not invent the format for Big Brother he was credited with playing a major part in making the show a success. During his time at the company the reality series was involved in a number of controversies including showing a couple apparently having sex, albeit under the covers, on Teen Big Brother in 2003. Five years ago, in the ‘celebrity’ version of the show, viewers were treated to the dubious privilege of seeing maverick MP George  Galloway dressed in a cat costume and as a vampire, while more recent participants include Sally Bercow, wife of the Commons Speaker. One critic has accused Bazalgette of doing more to ‘debase’ TV over the past decade than anyone else. In recent years he has acted largely as a consultant to the TV industry and for digital media. He has also written about the business of TV formats, with his book Billion Dollar Game published in 2005. Bazalgette said he viewed the award as an acknowledgment of the work of independent TV production firms. After graduating from Cambridge University, Bazalgette joined the BBC’s news trainee scheme,  moving on to become a researcher for That’s Life and then a reporter for Man Alive. Moving behind the cameras, he produced the long-running series Food And Drink before setting up his own company Bazal, later to be absorbed into the Dutch TV giant Endemol. He went on to become Endemol’s chief creative officer, leaving the company in 2007. Bazalgette is president of the Royal Television Society, deputy chairman of English National Opera and the National Film and Television School, and has served on the board of Channel 4. In January this year he was made a non-executive director to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport for his ‘business acumen’ and ‘particular insight into a broad spectrum of media issues’. Another successful TV executive, Paul Smith, the man behind Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?, is made a CBE. He was also executive producer of the Oscar-winning film Slumdog Millionaire.","Ex-convict Gerald Ronson and Conservative Party supporter Paul Ruddock both honoured .

"Thousand of British wine connoisseurs have unwittingly been drinking vintage burgundy topped up with cheap table wine under a scam operated by one of France’s most prestigious traders, prosecutors have claimed. Following an 18-month investigation, police say that merchants Labouré-Roi took bottles of Nuits St George and topped them up with supermarket wines. Nuits St George was not part of the scam which happened between 2005 and 2009 when 2million bottles were sold, police said at a press conference in Dijon. Wine from the Burgundy region (pictured) were filled up with cheaper supermarket wine . They were bought by people who thought they were buying Nuits St George vintages that were chateau-produced and, in some cases, prize-winning. Labouré-Roi, . which has been established since 1832, is the Burgundy region's third . biggest wine company and sells the drink across the world. Some . of the bottles were also individually numbered wines and the scam is . believed to have earned several hundred million pounds. Some . of the cases of wines were being sold for thousands of pounds despite . them being topped up with a cheaper wine from the south of France with . high alcohol content and available from supermarkets, the police said. Two of Labouré-Roi's . executives, brothers Armand, 82, and Louis Cottin, 83,were arrested . last week in a police sting along with a wine taster and the company . administrator. They were later released and are yet to be charged. Gendarmes . have seized significant amounts of wine and tax inspectors are also . looking into the company's records, a police spokesman said. Revelations about the Nuits St George scam come only a few weeks after it emerged in March this year that another wine company at Beaune in Burgundy allegedly cheated its customers with diluted AOS Bourgogne label wine. But the scale of the Labouré-Roi scam is likely to inflict far greater damage to the worldwide reputation of Burgundy wine. Labouré-Roi is a world-renowned name in wines which exports to 30 countries including Britain and the U.S., gleaning more than 50 per cent of its turnover from international trade. Armand Cottin, one of Labouré-Roi's directors said: 'We are three years after the period which was checked by investigators and we are now approaching a situation where we have an error rate of close to zero. 'The management is taking responsibility for the situation we are in.' A lawyer for the company said that none of the directors have been charged and the company had moved on from the period in question. The lawyer said that the main concern of the two directors who are in their eighties and are finding the present situation 'difficult to cope with' is to save the jobs of the company's 70 employees.","Labouré-Roi took expensive bottles of Nuits St George and put cheap supermarket wine in them .

With Olivier Giroud out with a fractured ankle until 2015, Wenger knows that unless he signs a new forward, the club might have to forget about their title ambitions. The Gunners boss claimed that he was ready to spend, but would not be forced into doing anything rash. He said: 'The pressure to buy is always there. We want to (buy) and we will work at it but let's not fool ourselves - it's not because you buy just one player that you win games.' Arsenal's manager was disappointed to only come away with a draw but the Frenchman admitted that it was a fair result. He said: 'We were a bit unlucky with the injury to (Laurent) Koscielny and after that the draw was a fair result. We did not create enough and they worked very hard. 'We missed a few opportunities maybe but I felt we lacked a little bit creativity and sharpness. 'We had two tough weeks with three away games - the Champions League was very demanding. It's not an excuse but we were a bit jaded.' Striker: Arsenal fans will be hoping that Arsene Wenger can find a suitable substitute for Olivier Giroud as Yaya Sanogo's performances have been unconvincing . Injury: Arsenal will be without Olivier Giroud until 2015 after he fractured his ankle against Everton, leaving the Gunners with just one genuine centre-forward . Tempers: The frustration of Arsenal's players was evident as they failed to build on their early goal and tempers flared close to the end of the match . Alexis Sanchez opened the scoring for the Gunners as he swept home Yaya Sanogo's cross. But Nigel Pearson's side weren't behind for long. A swift counter attack ended when Jeff Schlupp's pin-point cross was met by Leonardo Ulloa, who guided his header past Wojciech Szczesny. Arsene Wenger's side pressed for a winner but in truth Leicester had the better chances and could have won the game. Arsenal's manager said: 'We wanted so much to win that we lost any caution; we were more open to counter attacks and in the end we could have lost.' Meanwhile, Leicester captain Wes Morgan said: 'That (draw) was the least we deserved. We created quite a few chances - that was the least we deserved today. 'Obviously everyone knows how good Arsenal are and we worked hard to limit their chances. People know Leicester is a team they can't take lightly.' Close: Wojciech Szczesny makes an excellent save to deny Jamie Vardy from scoring a late winner, the Foxes looked a real threat when counter-attacking .

"The US army has demolished thousands of buildings at a US army base in Afghanistan, as the military ends its war in the region. The demolition  is taking place at Bagram airfield, one of the largest US bases in the country, located 50 km north of Kabul. Bagram has 1,800 temporary buildings which have all been destroyed this year, in a bid to stop the Taliban using any of its contents after the troops withdraw. Rubble: A US soldier walks past a pile of discarded wooden panels and debris - nicknamed 'Mount Trashmore' by the soldiers - during ongoing demolition work at Bagram Air Base near Kabul . Demolition: A US Army excavator demolishes a structure at Bagram Air Base, leaving a cloud of dust . Destruction: A wooden structure is pictured with gaping holes in the structure at Bagram Air Base . The US military has already removed much of the power supply, torn out fixtures by hand, and used mechanical diggers to destroy the roofs on buildings at the airfield. The operation comes as the massive NATO-led fighting force pulls out of the region after more than a decade on the ground fighting the Taliban. The wooden offices and dormitories being destroyed are a part of buildings that were hurriedly erected at Bagram. The buildings housed troops who first arrived in the country after 2001  when the US sent an extra 30,000 soldiers in the 2010 'surge'. At the height of the war, 130,000 international troops were fighting in Afghanistan. But combat operations will finish at the end of the year and only 12,500 soldiers will remain into 2015 on a training and support mission. War: This chart shows the number of US troops who were deployed to the country and casualties since 2001 . 'This is definitely a full-time job for us,' US Staff Sergeant Zach Smith, head of one of the demolition teams at Bagram said. 'Part of the process is removing all the interior rooms and electrical components and separating them so they can be properly disposed of.' Soldiers wearing yellow hardhats use crowbars and hammers to dismantle the vacated buildings that once housed desks, computers and bunk-beds. The work is fast but painstaking as material is sifted into different components for recycling or disposal, ensuring that no electrical items or other potential bomb-making kit can fall into Taliban hands. 'We absolutely do that in the most environmentally-conscious way that we possibly can,' Smith said.

Trash: A US soldier walks past a pile of discarded wooden panels and debris - nicknamed 'Mount Trashmore' 'Whenever there is fuel, oil, batteries, we dispose of those things to ensure that we leave Bagram the way we found it.' The splintered remains of each building are scooped into dumper trucks that make endless journeys back and forth to a tipping site on the edge of the base. Dubbed Mount Trash-more after Mount Rushmore -- the US mountain carved into the faces of former presidents -- the dump is opened to Afghan companies who salvage what they can from the debris. Lieutenant Wes Vermillion, who oversees the project said: 'Right now we've taken down about 1,800 temporary structures that were either living space or offices.' He said more than 2,000 buildings will be destroyed by December, with a final 500 torn down by contractors next year after the US military engineers have left. But as the base shrinks, it is also a hub for the retrograde operation to remove weapons, equipment and vehicles from Afghanistan as troops draw in from the provinces.

Removal: A US soldier removes barbed wire from a wall at Bagram  to make sure the Taliban does not get it . Colonel Stephanie Gradford is behind Bagram's adaption to its rapidly changing role. She said: 'We have a lot of folks coming in from other bases that we're sending home' 'We are retrograding equipment in preparation (for the NATO support mission) and preparing Bagram to be turned over, at some point in the next couple of years, to the Afghans.' Cargo aircraft loaded with gear and troops wait on the runway to leave the country, while elsewhere Afghan teams scour the site of a demolished canteen, even picking up spare nails left on the ground.

Occupants: The discarded hat of a US soldier is pictured at quarters marked for demolition at Bagram Air Base . Rest: 'This is definitely a full-time job,' US Staff Sergeant Zach Smith, head of one of the demolition teams said . Bagram's permanent buildings and roads are being kept for the US forces that will still be deployed next year, and then for the Afghan military that will be left to thwart any Taliban resurgence. In 2001, about 30,000 foreign soldiers and civilians were housed at the former Soviet base, but the number is down to 15,000 today and will be cut to 6,000 US troops next year. By the end of 2016, the only US military presence in Afghanistan will be at the embassy in Kabul. The reality that, after 13 years of war, the US military's vast apparatus is on its way out is only just sinking in even for the soldiers themselves, according to Colonel Gradford. 'They want to see the mission through, so it's tough even getting military people to understand that we are changing,' she said.","The military is destroying buildings at Bagram airfield 50 km north of Kabul .

"Greek archaeologists have come one step closer to solving the mystery of who is buried in a vast ancient tomb dating to Alexander the Great's era. Skeletal remains have been found in and around a stone-lined cistern in the opulent 4th Century B.C. burial site in Amphipolis, north-east Greece. The site is believed to be the largest ancient . tomb to have been discovered in Greece, and has spurred . speculation as to whether Alexander the Great or a member of . his family was buried there. Solving a mystery: Archaeologists have found skeletal remains inside a  grave in the innermost chamber of  an ancient tomb in Amphipolis, north Greece. There has been great speculation in recent months whom the opulent burial belongs to . Alexander died in Babylonia, present day Iraq, but his burial site is not known, and Greece's culture ministry said today the opulence of the tomb indicates that a 'distinguished public figure' is buried there. The skeletal remains are being examined for identification, . Greece's culture ministry said in a statement. The body had been placed in a wooden coffin, which . disintegrated over time. The skeletal remains were found both . inside and outside the rectangular stone-lined cist, under the floor of the cavernous, vaulted structure that is 26 feet (eight metres) tall . Iron and bronze nails as well as carved bone and glass decorations . from the coffin were also found scattered in the grave. Findings: Greece's Culture Ministry said skeleton was strewn in and around the stone-lined cistern, pictured, under the floor of the cavernous, vaulted structure that is 26ft tall . Opulent: There has been speculation that the tomb could be that of Alexander the Great . New find: surviving fragments of carved bone and glass coffin ornaments found in the tomb at Amphipolis . Alexander III of Macedon was born in Pella, the ancient capital of Macedonia in July 356 BC. He died of a fever in Babylon in June 323 BC. Alexander led an army across the Persian territories of Asia Minor, Syria and Egypt claiming the land as he went. His greatest victory was at the Battle of Gaugamela, now northern Iraq, in 331 BC, and during his trek across these Persian territories, he was said to never have suffered a defeat. This led him to be known as Alexander the Great. Following this battle in Gaugamela, Alexander led his army a further 11,000 miles (17,700km), founded over 70 cities and created an empire that stretched across three continents. This covered from Greece in the west, to Egypt in the south, Danube in the north, and Indian Punjab to the East. Alexander was buried in Egypt. His fellow royals were traditionally interred in a cemetery near Vergina, far to the west. The lavishly-furnished tomb of Alexander's father, Philip II, was discovered during the 1970s. Archaeologists in . the past have said the grave likely belonged to a prominent . Macedonian and some have hoped it might have been built for Alexander the Great's mother or wife, while others think it belongs to a military man. A statement from the Culture Ministry said: 'It is probably the monument of a dead person who became a . hero, meaning a mortal who was worshipped by society at that . time. 'The deceased was a prominent person, . since only this could explain the construction of this unique . burial complex.' ‘It is an extremely expensive construction, whose cost, clearly, is unlikely to have been borne by a private citizen.' Michalis Tiverios, a professor of archaeology at the University of Thessaloniki who has not been involved with the dig, said the human remains should provide valuable information on the occupant of the tomb, which at about 49 ft (15 metres) long and 15 ft (4.5 metres) wide is one of the biggest ever found in the country. ‘It's a very important find because it will help us learn the sex of the person buried there, and possibly their approximate age,’ he said. Professor Tiverios believes one possible candidate would be Nearchos, one of Alexander's closest aides who led his fleet back from India to modern Iraq, and who grew up in Amphipolis. The ministry confirmed fears that the tomb had been thoroughly and repeatedly plundered during antiquity. ‘Whatever objects of value the first thieves missed was taken by others later,’ Professor Tiverios said. Excavations at the site in northeastern Greece near the city . of Thessaloniki began in 2012. They captured global attention in . August when archaeologists announced the discovery of vast tomb . guarded by two sphinxes and circled by a 497-metre marble wall. Since then the tomb has also yielded a mosaic made of . coloured pebbles depicting the abduction of Persephone, the . daughter of Zeus, as well as two sculpted female figures also . known as Caryatids. The tomb dates to 300-325 B.C. Alexander the . Great died in 323 B.C. after a military campaign through the . Middle East, Asia and northeast Asia. Experts believe the ancient mound, situated around 65 miles (100km) from Thessaloniki (shown on the map) was built for a prominent Macedonian in around 300 to 325 BC . Clockwise from top right shows two headless, marble sphinxes found above the entrance to the barrel-vaulted tomb, details of the facade and the lower courses of the blocking wall, the antechamber's mosaic floor, a 4.2-metre long stone slab, and the upper uncovered sections of two female figures. The second and third chambers, not pictured, have not yet been explored .

Las Vegas' Treasure Island confirmed on Friday that the comedian's show, the day after Thanksgiving, had been canceled, reportedly by 'mutual agreement'. Broadway Center in Tacoma, Washington also just pulled out of an April Cosby show according to TMZ, saying they took into consideration 'the financial harm we will suffer by cancelling, and even greater financial risk of moving forward with the performance.' In the past week, numerous allegations of sexual abuse against Cosby, 77, from a number of women have led to canceled interviews along with NBC and Netflix projects. Scroll down for video . Bill Cosby appeared on stage in Barbados on Thursday night for the first time since nine women came forward this month to claim they had been attacked by the star . Show's over: Diamond Desert Casino in Tucson, Arizona (right) didn't explain why Cosby's February 15 show was canceled while Treasure Island in Las Vegas (left) said it was by 'mutual agreement' with the star . TV Land has also announced that they will no longer air reruns of The Cosby Show on the network. Netflix postponed the airing of his new comedy special, Bill Cosby 77, which was due to air the day after Thanksgiving. NBC pulled the plug on a comedy project they were developing with The Cosby Show star. He pulled out of scheduled slots with Queen Latifah and David Letterman and, when asked about the allegations in a November 6 interview with the Associated Press, said: 'There's no response ... I don't talk about it.' The show must go on: Cosby was on stage in Barbados on Thursday night . Including an appearance in Melbourne, Florida tonight, Cosby is slated to perform at least 36 shows between now and May 2015. Cosby issued a statement on Sunday discrediting decades-old accusations and his attorney has denied four of the allegations. He made his first stage appearance since the scandal emerged  at a benefit on Thursday night for a women's service organization in the Bahamas. During the performance, the 77-year-old put his head in his hands and pretended to sob, new video obtained by MailOnline has revealed today. He joked that parents would not let their children near him, as fans in the audience laughed and applauded the skit. 'Parents are coming and taking their children home, saying to me ''Bill Cosby you are an evil man!'',' the entertainer said through faux tears on stage. But the entertainer then shook it off, smiled and started what became a well-scripted 90 minute performance. A total of nine women have now come forward this month claiming the famed entertainer abused them. MailOnline was awaiting comment from Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, on Friday. Cosby's show next Friday at the Treasure Island Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas has been canceled by 'mutual agreement', the venue confirmed today .

Moritz claims Cosby forced her to perform oral sex in 1971, while Leslie alleges he forced her to masturbate him in 1992 . Former supermodel Janice Dickinson has claimed that Bill Cosby drugged and raped her . Andrea Constand - A Temple University employee, she claimed in 2006 that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion two years earlier. Cosby eventually settled this suit out of court as the prosecution said they had 13 Jane Does who would testify Cosby did the same to them in the past. Barbara Bowman - Bowman told MailOnline that Cosby raped and drugged her back in 1985 when she was a 17-year-old aspiring actress. Bowman was one of the 13 Jane Does in the 2006 trial against Cosby. Joan Tarshis - Tarshis claimed that she was just 19-years-old when Cosby drugged and raped her twice in Hollywood back in 1969 while she was working as a writer for him. Janice Dickinson - The supermodel said in an interview that Cosby asked her to come to Lake Tahoe and talk about a television role in 1982, but ended up drugging and raping her. Tamara Green - Green, who first came forward in 2005 told MailOnline that she was an aspiring actress in the 1970s when Cosby gave her pills and pretended to care for her while she had the flu, but instead sexually assaulted her. Therese Serignese - Also one of the 13 Jane Does, she says she was 19 when Cosby drugged and raped her in Las Vegas after one of his shows. Louisa Moritz -  She accused Cosby of sexual assault, saying he once forced her into oral sex, backstage at The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in 1971, and implied he would further her career if she went through with it. Linda Joy Traitz - She said earlier this week that she was just 19 when Cosby drove her out to a beach and tried to get her to take pills to relax, before becoming 'sexually aggressive'. Traitz, of Hallandale Beach, Florida, has been charged in the past with trafficking pills. Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, is trying to use Traitz's past to discredit her claims against his client. Beth Ferrier - Beth Ferrier claims she had relationship with Cosby in the mid-1980s. She claims that she awoke in her car with her clothes in disarray and not remembering what had happened. Ferrier has claimed that he drugged her coffee. Carla Ferrigno - The wife of Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno, claims Cosby tried to sexually assault her during a gathering at his house in 1967.

"A gang of kidnappers who held a man hostage and cut off his little finger when his family could not pay the £60,000 ransom were jailed today for a total of 152 years. Victim Damien Lowe was abducted on a street in Coventry at gunpoint and bundled into a van where a group of ten masked men kept him without food or water for 31 hours. When his family initially failed to pay the money his kidnappers demanded, the gang chopped off his finger and left it under a brick on a garden wall for his panicked relatives to find.

The kidnappers were sentenced at Leamington Justice Centre today. Mr Lowe, 26, from Coventry, West Midlands, said: 'The moment they pulled up next to me in their van in balaclavas and bundled me into the back was the most terrifying experience of my life. 'It was so brutal I don't know how I survived. When it first happened I had no idea what was going on. 'The van was going all over the place I didn't have a chance to try and think where I was. 'When they took my phone and got me to find my brother's number I didn't know what they were going to do. 'I thought I was going to die there and then. When they told me I had to ask for £60,000 ransom I was almost relieved. Kidnappers:  (L-R) Antony McLeod, 34, sentenced to 15 years and Ralph McLeod, 37, sentenced to 18 years . Gang members: (L-R) Kadeem Poyser, 26, sentenced to 13 years and Kofi Poyser, 23, sentenced to 16 years .

When they came in and covered my face I knew something bad was going to happen. 'That was when they cut my finger off. The pain was unbelievable and I was just crying out and then they just beat me again. Mr Lowe was kidnapped from a street near his home on the afternoon of September 30 2014.

Mr Lowe's family scraped together £20,000 to pay the kidnappers, and the 26-year-old was later thrown out of the vehicle on a a suburban street, before being found and rushed to hospital. Working with intelligence gathered from West Midlands Police’s Serious Organised Crime Unit (SOCU), officers then stormed a house where the kidnappers were staying, and recovered the £20,000.

"A former US Army reservist has pleaded no contest to stealing the identities of his fellow soldiers while he was stationed in Afghanistan. Los Angeles County prosecutors say Gustavo Cervantes, 24, of Pomona and his cousin pleaded no contest Tuesday to grand theft and identity theft. Cervantes was sentenced in Los Angeles to three years and eight months in prison and Rigoberto Cortez, 30, got seven years. Heartless thieves: Ex-Army reservist Gustavo Cervantes (left), 24, and his cousin, Rigoberto Cortez (right), 30, pleaded no contest to grand theft and identity theft in a scam targeting Cervantes' comrades . The cousins also were ordered to pay more than $200,000 in restitution. Prosecutors say that during a 10-month period beginning in January 2013, Cervantes stole ID information on seven fellow soldiers he had met while stationed in Kandahar Province. Cervantes then allegedly forwarded the information to Cortez in Pomona, who established lines of credit and credit card accounts. Cervantes allegedly used the misbegotten credit cards to buy luxury cars, furniture, kitchen appliances and TVs. Ten financial institutions lost a total of about $217,000 as a result of the defendant's scam, according to the District Attorney’s Office. Captain Shaun Mathers, of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, told NBC Miami that all the victims of the scam were soldiers from Cervantes' own platoon. 'Here these people are defending our country and then being victimized by one of their fellow soldiers,' he told the station.","Gustavo Cervantes, 24, of Pomona, California, and his cousin pleaded no contest to grand theft and identity theft .

"Hospitals should let more elderly patients die, a top cardiologist has claimed (file picture) Hospitals should let more elderly patients die, a top cardiologist has claimed. Dr James Beattie believes that doctors resuscitate too many older people because society does not see enough death, leaving many people unwilling to accept mortality. He pointed out that frail pensioners routinely receive hospital medical interventions such as flu jabs which are designed to prolong life, but not necessarily improve it. The cardiologist said that when it comes to resuscitating the elderly, particularly those with dementia, patients’ quality of life should be given more consideration and more people should be allowed to die. ‘If a person is in hospital, particularly an elderly person with multiple co-morbidities, if they have a cardiac arrest it’s a sign they are in decline,’ he told Radio 4. ‘It’s their act of dying and they should not be resuscitated, they should be allowed to die.’ Dr Beattie, who works at the East of England NHS Foundation Trust in Birmingham, explained that the chance of an elderly person leaving hospital after being resuscitated is around 5 per cent. But he said the issue was a difficult one because people today are less likely to think and talk about death thanks to advancements in modern medicine, which mean that people are living longer. ‘Society these days is much less familiar with death,’ he said, adding: ‘Our great-grandparents and to some extent our grandparents grew up with people dying before the days of antibiotics. ‘That’s denied these days. People died at home. Death is now becoming something in hospitals and care homes, somewhere removed from the family and the home.’ He went on to say: ‘We need to make it a more natural expectation. Life is 100 per cent mortality and we need to get used to that.’ Family doctors are taking up valuable consultation time asking patients to sign petitions demanding extra cash for their surgeries, it emerged last night. Dr James Beattie believes that doctors resuscitate too many older people because society does not see enough death, leaving many people unwilling to accept mortality (file picture) The average consultation is just seven minutes long. But despite claiming they often do not have enough time to listen to patients’ problems, some GPs have been using consultations to drum up support for extra funding. The move follows an email from the Royal College of GPs, which urged practices to get as many patients’ names as possible to bolster their campaign. Andrew Percy, a Tory member of the Commons health select committee, said: ‘It’s staggering that GPs claim to not have enough time to complete consultations with patients, but they can find time to get patients to sign petitions. ‘I doubt many patients feel comfortable saying no. This is a clear abuse of their position, especially as I suspect that with greater funding would come calls for even greater GP salaries.’",Dr James Beattie believes that medics resuscitate too many elderly patients .
"An advertising agency has caused outrage after creating a promotion for a mattress company which depicts schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai being shot in the face. The advert shows Malala, who was 14 when she was shot by a Taliban extremist, falling backwards covered in blood, being attached to a drip and then 'bouncing back' to receive an award. A staff member at global firm Ogilvy & Mather initially defended the advert as a tribute - but the firm has now apologised and launched an investigation after it was blasted as wildly insensitive. Scroll down for video . 'Distasteful': The advert was produced by ad agency Ogilvy and features Malala Yousafzai being shot aged 14 . Heroine: Now 16, the schoolgirl has become a figurehead for women's rights around the world . Indian bedding company Kurl-On commissioned a series of three poster adverts from the Indian branch of the design agency, which was founded by British David Ogilvy in 1948. The other two ads in the series show Gandhi leaving his career as a barrister to become a peace activist, and Steve Jobs bouncing back after he was kicked out of Apple. A person claiming to be a representative of Ogilvy, posting on the Ads of the World website, initially wrote: 'We do not believe that getting shot in the face was the defining moment in this brave young 14-year-old’s life - it was her courage and determination to rise from hopeless circumstances. 'We believe that her’s is a breathtakingly inspiring story and while all of us do not have the raw courage or moral fiber to do what she did, we can try to pay a tribute to her by any means available to us. 'In this case, the means happened to be an advertising campaign. If we were architects, we would erect a monument in her honor.' But the advert was savaged by industry experts, including Canadian executive Tom Megginson. Campaign: The other two adverts posted online featured Steve Jobs (left) and Mahatma Gandhi 'bouncing back' Treatment: Pakistani soldiers shift injured women's rights activist Malala Yousafzai, then 14, from a helicopter at an army hospital following the extremist gun attack in Peshawar in October 2012 . He wrote on his blog: '14-year-olds getting shot in the face by terrorists are appropriate content for mattress ads now? 'I am ashamed to be in the same industry as these ad people.' The advert has now been removed from the Ads of the World website, while the firm behind it has apologised and launched a probe into what it said was a breach of standards. 'We deeply regret this incident and want to . personally apologise to Malala Yousafzai and her family. We are . investigating how our standards were compromised in this case and will . take whatever corrective action is necessary' Ogilvy & Mather's India spokesman Greg Carton said: 'The recent Kurl-On ads from our India . office are contrary to the beliefs and professional standards of Ogilvy . & Mather and our clients. 'We deeply regret this incident and want to . personally apologise to Malala Yousafzai and her family. 'We are . investigating how our standards were compromised in this case and will . take whatever corrective action is necessary. 'In addition, we have . launched a thorough review of our approval and oversight processes . across our global network to help ensure that our standards are never . compromised again.' He added: 'This was a paid client campaign and only the Steve Jobs piece ran in a . local newspaper in India a few weeks ago. 'The Malala piece has never . been in paid media - nor will it be.' Malala’s representatives said the advert was 'distasteful', but declined to comment further. One Twitter user, @juelzkeyte, said: 'Just had to pick my jaw off my desk at the news Malala Yousafzai's image is being used for a mattress advert. Beyond words.' She added: 'I just don't even know where to begin with this. Utterly utterly abhorrent. I could scream.' Heroine: The education rights campaigner pictured last year (left) and when she was 12 years old (right) The advert is only the latest in a long line to cause offence so far this year. This week a 'lewd' Danish advert was criticised for trying literally to 'sex up' the European elections with a bare-chested hero called Voteman, who was depicted in bed with five women before punching non-voters in the face. In March a billboard in Las Vegas advertising an Asian bistro with a woman's naked back and the words 'always a happy ending' was slammed for using 'insulting' stereotypes. Irish bookmaker Paddy Power, meanwhile, provoked outrage by taking bets on the Oscar Pistorius trial’s outcome and offering to refund punters if he was cleared. And in January a 'degrading' advertisement depicting a beef patty sandwiched between a woman's buttocks, proclaiming 'the freshest fun between the buns', was banned in Australia. Other comments on Twitter included 'that's just sick', 'so, so, so appalling' and 'can't believe someone thought this was okay'. Pakistani-born Malala was shot in the face on a school bus by an extremist Taliban gunman because she wanted to receive an education, in a horrific crime that shocked the world. Malala, now 16, was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham where she recovered from her injuries. The young girl has since released her autobiography, and has received a string of humanitarian awards for her continued activism, including a Nobel Peace Prize nomination. Kurl-On claim to the world’s largest manufacturers and distributors of mattresses and beds, and export their products to several countries including Britain. It is not known whether the mattress firm approved the design. Several Kurl-On representatives did not immediately return requests for comment. A spokesman for the British Advertising Standards Authority said he could not say whether the advert would be against its guidelines unless it was used in Britain and received complaints. 'The codes are very strict and say adverts should not contain anything which would cause serious or widespread offence,' he added.","Cartoon features schoolgirl, then 14, falling backwards covered in blood .

"Joe Biden considers himself to be part of America’s middle class, despite his $379,000 income. Speaking to the National Council of La Raza in Las Vegas about home ownership, the vice president said that the upper class ‘doesn’t get it – for middle class folks like me and you, owning a home is the single most consequential element to our existence.’ President Obama has been heavily campaigning his $250,000 threshold that would cause income taxes to rise for the wealthy. Scroll down for video . Stuck in the middle: Speaking yesterday, Joe Biden referred to himself as middle class . Critical: Biden was quick to criticize Mitt Romney for lacking sound judgement . Mr and Dr Jill Biden, according to his 2011 tax return, made a little more than $307,000 in salary, has several trusts and annuities, and more than $24,000 in social security benefits. Dr Biden teaches English at Northern Virginia Community College, earning around $82,000 for classes taught at the Alexandria campus. Much of the Obama administration’s re-election has been centred around making presumptive Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney appear aloof and out of touch with the struggles of middle-class Americans. However, the median household income for Americans was $51,000, according to a February 2012 study by Sentier Research. But as the White House Dossier notes, ‘If Biden feels he is middle class, it may be due to his apparent inability to manage his finances.’ The Dossier cites a December 2011 report by the Center for Responsive Politics, which claims that the vice president is a liability to Mr Obama’s cabinet, financially speaking, and could have negative assets. War for the White House: Mr Obama, right, has been trying to portray former Bain Capital CEO Mitt Romney, left, as wealthy and out-of-touch with Middle America . Mr Biden makes $225,521 with his vice presidential salary, which combined with his wife’s salary and their combined assets equal $379,035, but has mortgages and home equity loans, as well as two lines of credit and a loan taken from his life insurance policy. In his speech, Mr Biden slammed Mr Romney’s time at Bain Capital, saying the former Massachusetts governor lacked ‘sound judgment.’ Speaking on the housing crisis, he had said: ‘So many people, through no fault in their own, caught up in this crisis, because three neighbours in their development had a sub-prime mortgage, they went belly-up and all of a sudden they find their house, they are upside down. 'They did nothing wrong, they missed no payment. These guys don’t get it. For middle class folks like me and you, owning a home is maybe the single most consequential element to our existence.’","In 2011 tax return, Joe Biden and wife earned combined income of $379,000 .

"Memory swipes: Samantha McDonald says she has been abducted by aliens . A British woman claims she has been abducted by aliens on repeated visits since she first made contact with them in the 1990s. Samantha McDonald told a sceptical Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby on This Morning how she has experienced supernatural activity from the early 1990s until last year. She describes her extraterrestrial visitors as 'the reptilians' and 'the greys' - who she believes are working together. She said: 'I've asked them what they want with me and . they have said they had come to take me and my family. What they were . after was my energy and soul essence. 'I don't know why they keep coming . back to me. I think it is to do with my energies as I'm into healing and . meditation.' When asked to describe what happens when she's taken, Samantha said she has no recollection of her ordeals. She explained: 'You don't . always remember the abductions because you have memory swipes. You just . feel like you have been somewhere but you don't actually remember it.' When Phillip queried if this is what most of us what describe as a dream she replied: 'No definitely not. I've woken up with marks all over my body and been possessed - . sometimes to the point of mind control - where thoughts come into your head . that are not your own. I can't explain it any other way.' She added that she has woken up to find her body covered in needle marks, scratches and bruises after an abduction. While she hasn't had a visit for the past year, Samantha said she doesn't fear a return. 'I've been through so much already I try to take it in my stride,' she said. She revealed that she believes her other-worldly experiences have also led to her being put under surveillance on Earth, stating she often has black helicopters over her home and has been followed by police cars. ''I think they are trying to send the message, ""we are watching you, you better be careful""', Samantha said of the not so subtle surveillance. Samantha appeared on the ITV show as part of their 'supernatural week' along with Joanne Summerscales, founder of the AMMACH Project (which stands for Anomalous Mind Management Abductee Contactee Helpline). Scroll down for video . Not alone: Joanne Summerscales, left, has said Samantha is not alone in her experience of extraterrestrials and so she has set up a support group to help them . Joanne said that through her work on the project, which is designed to support those 'usually ridiculed by mainstream ""conventionals""' she has found many common threads in experience of those who say they have been abducted by aliens. Like Samantha claims, many say they have woken up to find themselves covered in unexplained injuries and seem to be under surveillance. 'It's really common. The frequency of helicopter sightings over people who have had alien abductions is phenomenal,' she said. Joanne said she didn't believe sleep paralysis was an explanation for why people feel they have experienced alien abduction, even though the symptoms of the condition include an temporary inability to move, a feeling someone is in the room, hallucinations and sometimes unconsciously self harming. Unexplained injuries: Samantha says she has woken up covered in needle marks and bruises following her abductions . Supernatural: Other This Morning viewers said they have experienced UFOs . Joanne . said some of these people have been examined by MRI scans and black . light frequency 48 hours after their experience and this has shown . florescent marks such as handprints on their bodies. She said she is never incredulous about the supernatural stories people tell her. 'We have to treat people who say this has happened to them with respect,' she said. 'I don't believe in aliens, I know about them, so it's not about believing but knowing.' During the rest of the week, This Morning will meet a number of people who claim to have had supernatural experiences - from ghost sightings to telekinesis. Ahead of the special week, the show asked viewers for their views on the supernatural. Their survey of 1500 men and women found that almost one in three think they may have seen a UFO and the same number think they have seen a ghost. Nearly one in five had visited a medium but almost half of them felt cheated by the person claiming to have psychic powers. A third say they have experienced items vanishing or moving or odd bumps in the night. Sixty per cent don't believe it's possible to move an object with the power of your mind but 20 per cent believe you can have sex with ghosts. The results also revealed that Samantha isn't the only one to feel a victim of alien abduction, as four per cent said it had also happened to them. A . spokesman from This Morning said: 'Our viewers are fascinated by the . supernatural and these survey results show that many have had an . encounter with a ghost, seen UFO's and would like to make contact with . the dead. 'During . the week our hosts - some reluctantly - will explore the supernatural . world more closely with experts and will also try to find evidence of . the afterlife themselves.' Indeed, a phone in from viewers later in the today's show revealed others have had experiences of UFOs. One said they had seen a strange flying object while driving late at night while another said they had seen crop circles and believed aliens were trying to communicate with us via our food.

"David Harding paid £34m in tax on his 2011 earnings . Britain's highest earner has revealed that he paid £34million in tax last year. David Harding, founder of Winton . Capital Management, the world’s fifth-largest hedge fund, paid 39 per . cent tax on his £87million income. His decision to disclose his tax bill . follows a public outcry over the aggressive tax avoidance practices of . some of the country’s top earners. In an unprecedented move, David Harding, founder of the Winton Capital hedge fund, has opened his books to reveal he paid the full £34m on his £87millon income in 2011. While most at his level avoid paying their share - hiding vast sums in offshore accounts or relocating themselves to foreign tax havens - Mr Harding said he would rather be 'accepted by society'. Last year he took a salary of £16.1 million paying income tax of more than £8m at a rate of 50 per cent. He took a further £71.3m in dividends on which he paid tax at the lower rate of 40 per cent and paid £325,000 in national insurance contributions. Winton Capital, which he founded in 1997, is due to pay £133m on its 2011 revenues at a rate of 38 per cent. Mr Harding donates £50,000 a year to the Conservative Party but claims to veer towards the centre-left politically and would consider donating to the Liberal Democrats if approached. A philanthropist too, he has given £20million to the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge and is on the development board of the Francis Crick Institute a £1m medical research centre. David Cameron (right)  described Comedian Jimmy Carr as 'morally wrong' for using a scheme which allowed him to pay 1 per cent tax on part of his earnings . He told the Sunday Times: 'I think that if you want to be accepted by society you have to be seen to be paying your share. 'I . think the resentment and anger is felt among the middle class - the . civil servants, the teachers, the soldiers,the public sector workers, . the professional classes, the backbone of the British nation.' The tax affairs of the rich have come under increased scrutiny in the wake of the Economic crisis. Earlier this year Prime Minister David Cameron described the comedian Jimmy Carr as 'morally wrong' after it was revealed he had put part of his earnings in an offshore fund allowing him to pay a rate of just 1 per cent tax. In the race to become Mayor of London earlier this year, both Boris Johnson and Ken Livingstone published their tax returns, with Livingstone's campaign hindered by allegations he used some creative accounting to avoid paying his full share. Mr Harding, who was brought up in Oxford, admitted he had in the past been tempted to leave Britain. He added: 'It would be impossible for it not to cross your mind. Not for me: Mr Harding has shunned foreign tax havens such as the Bahamas saying he is happily based in England . 'I am not sure I would easily find a better place to move to. I speak English, my life is here, I like England and the tax rate is not higher than Scandanavia or the rest of Europe. 'Taxes in Switzerland are not as low as they used to be. I can't go to the Bahamas, I've got family.' The 51-year-old, who recently married a German employee, has a 19-year-old son from a former marriage and two more children from an earlier relationship. He insisted he was not 'whiter than white' adding: 'I'd rather not pay the tax. But everyone is aware that the country has to fill in its budget deficit from somewhere. You can't run a huge deficit forever. 'I would pay any tax to do something which was vital for my country as long as I didn't feel it was vindictive.'","David Harding, founder of the Winton Capital hedge fund paid the full £34m on his £87millon income in 2011 .

"Top of the bill: Emma Watson is believed to top a list of guests to be invited to a new 'Cool Britannia' party at 10 Downing Street . Prime Minister David Cameron is poised to emulate Tony Blair’s ‘Cool Britannia’ celebration  by inviting some of the biggest names from the worlds of acting and music to a Downing Street party. Among those reportedly sent invitations for the star-studded ‘Best of Britain’s creative industries’ reception at No 10 later this month are Benedict Cumberbatch, Emma Watson, Chiwetel Ejiofor, the star of the Oscar-winning Twelve Years a Slave, plus Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig. But a notable omission from the list is said to be Take That singer Gary Barlow, after revelations in May that he was part of a massive tax avoidance scheme. Other celebrity names on the draft guestlist include pop star Eliza Doolittle and Emily Eavis, the daughter of Glastonbury Festival founder Michael, X Factor supremo Simon Cowell, classical singers Bryn Terfel and Katherine Jenkins, plus Hollywood names Sam Mendes, Harvey Goldsmith, Ridley Scott and Alan Parker. Nicole Kidman, though Australian-born, is said to be among those invited. Mr Cameron has also sent an invitation to Pete Czernin, a lesser-known film producer – who was once a flatmate of the Prime Minister. The event on June 30 is officially non-political but Whitehall sources told the Times the party was in part an attempt to recruit new supporters to the Conservatives’ cause ahead of the 2015 General Election. Gabby Bertin, who became director of external relations at No 10 last year, is overseeing the bash. Last night, the event was described by the Times, which revealed the existence of the draft guestlist, as ‘the most glittering collection of celebrities since Tony Blair tried to cash in on the Britpop craze  with his 1997 celebration of “Cool Britannia”.’ It is a comparison the PM may well not want to encourage. Mr Blair’s . party, which included such luminaries as Oasis guitarist Noel . Gallagher, became a millstone around his neck as various stars . criticised the New Labour government. It became seen in some quarters as . exemplifying New Labour’s obsession with celebrity. Blur singer Damon Albarn, who refused an invitation at the time, later said: ‘I knew by then we had all been taken for a ride.’ Invitations: David Cameron (left) is believed to be keen on the idea of holding a 'Cool Britannia' party but Gary Barlow (right) could miss out on an invite after revelations of his tax avoidance schemes . And Gallagher later notoriously claimed to have taken cocaine in a lavatory normally reserved for the Queen. Recalling the incident when interviewed for BBC Radio 2 by Russell Brand, he claimed: ‘These were the days of the revolution. Someone said, “Do you want to have a look in the Queen’s bog?” I said, “Of course”. As I remember, it was quite nice. It had a velvet seat and everything.’ Other . guests at Blair’s 1997 party were Hollywood star Kevin Spacey, actress . Sinead Cusack, fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, comedian Harry . Enfield, Body Shop founder Anita Roddick and Beatles biographer Hunter . Davies. As . for Mr Cameron’s bash, actor and Conservative Party supporter Sir . Michael Caine, TV presenters Clare Balding, Fearne Cotton and Cat Deeley . are also invited – as are Dame Helen Mirren and Ralph Fiennes, who both . attended the Blair-era party too.

"China has launched an experimental spacecraft  to fly around the moon and back to Earth. The eight-day mission is seen as a test-run for the country's first unmanned return trip to the lunar surface, which will take place in 2017. And if China successfully manages to bring samples back from the moon, they will be only the third nation to carry out such a mission after the US and Russia. Scroll down for video . China sent a mission to the moon from the southwestern Xichang satellite launch centre this morning (shown). The spacecraft will fly around the moon on an eight-day mission. It is intended to be a precursor to a mission to the lunar surface in 2017 . The spacecraft lifted off from the southwestern Xichang satellite launch centre early this morning. It separated from its carrier rocket and entered Earth orbit shortly after, the State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (Sastind) reported, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. 'The first stage of the first return journey test in China's moon probe programme has been successful,' Sastind said after the launch, from the Xichang space base in the southwestern province of Sichuan. The module will be 257,000 miles (413,000 km) from Earth at its furthest point on the eight-day mission. The official Xinhua news agency said it would re-enter the atmosphere at 11.2 kilometres per second (25,000 mph) before slowing down - a process that generates extremely high temperatures - and it will land in northern China's Inner Mongolia region. China's lunar exploration program, named Chang'e after a mythical goddess, has already launched a pair of orbiting lunar probes and last year landed a craft on the moon with a rover onboard. China has also hinted at a possible crewed mission to the moon at a future date if officials decide to combine the human spaceflight and lunar exploration programs. The module will be 257,000 miles (413,000 km) from Earth at its furthest point on the eight-day mission. The official Xinhua news agency said it would re-enter the atmosphere at 11.2 kilometres per second (25,000 mph) before slowing down - a process that generates extremely high temperatures - and it will land in northern China's Inner Mongolia region. It will return to Earth using a Soviet-designed method in which it will first bounce off Earth's atmosphere in order to slow it down to allow it to enter the atmosphere without burning up. Xinhua said the latest mission is to 'obtain experimental data and validate re-entry technologies such as guidance, navigation and control, heat shield and trajectory design' for the future moonlander christened Chang'e 5. It will return to Earth using a Soviet-designed method in which it will first bounce off Earth's atmosphere in order to slow it down to allow it to enter the atmosphere without burning up. China's military-backed space program is a source of massive national pride, especially its series of successful manned missions that have placed up to three astronauts at a time in an experimental orbiting space station called Tiangong 1. It sent its first astronaut into space in 2003, becoming the third nation after Russia and the US to achieve manned space travel independently. China has powered ahead in a series of methodically timed steps, independent of the American programme, which is now in its sixth decade of putting people into space and has long-term plans to go to an asteroid and Mars. Alongside the manned program, China is developing the Long March 5 heavy-lift rocket needed to launch a more permanent space station to be called Tiangong 2. China's space programme has been picking up speed over the last decade. They have already sent a handful of astronauts into Earth orbit including Liu Yang, left, Jing Haipeng, right, and Liu Wang pictured here in June 2012 on their way to the launch pad . Last year China successfully landed and operated a rover on the moon called Jade Rabbit, shown. However, it ultimately succumbed to the bitterly cold lunar nights.

"Sir John Major said Britain had a 50 per cent chance of leaving the EU, adding the country 'could not absorb' so many migrants in the future . Britain is likely to leave the EU unless it allows us to restrict immigration, Sir John Major warned last night. In an extraordinary intervention, the former prime minister said ‘our small island cannot absorb’ the huge numbers moving here each year. Sir John, who declared as premier that he wanted Britain at the heart of the EU, claimed our chances of leaving the union were ‘just under 50 per cent’ – and warned this would increase unless Brussels reforms rules on freedom of movement. He said that although the country welcomed hard-working migrants, the ‘sheer scale of the influx’ had put ‘strains on our health, welfare, housing and education services’. Britain had accepted ‘one of, if not the largest population movement in peacetime European history’, he told an audience in Germany, adding that failure to tackle the trend would cause ‘huge public disquiet’. ‘It is a matter of numbers,’ he said. ‘Whereas some European populations are falling, the UK has grown by 7 per cent in a decade.’ More than a million people have entered Britain from Poland and seven other former Eastern bloc countries since 2004, when temporary restrictions on migrants from those nations were dropped by Labour. Officials had predicted that just 13,000 would arrive each year. Sir John, the last Tory leader to win a Commons majority, stressed that he grew up among immigrants in south London who were friends and neighbours. ‘I hate having to make this argument. I hate it. I don’t wish to close our doors to strangers, especially strangers with skills from countries that are often allies. ‘But I do recognise, reluctantly, that our small island simply cannot absorb the present and projected numbers at the current speed. It is not physically or politically possible without huge public disquiet.’ Sir John also launched a strong attack on Ukip, saying: ‘I hope we are going to push them back to the fringes of politics from which they should never have emerged.’ The Tory grandee – whose remarks were shown to and discussed with Downing Street in advance – sketched out David Cameron’s plan to negotiate looser ties with Brussels. Sir John said the country had received one of the largest population movements in peacetime European history, with droves more expected. Migrants try to board lorries bound for Britain in Calais (pictured) European migrants should only be entitled to child benefit equal to the rate paid by the country where their child lives, Nick Clegg has said. The move would result in Polish parents in Britain with children who live in Poland receiving £18 per month, rather than the British rate of £80. The call for change – ahead of wider government proposals to limit migrants’ benefits – follows a ruling by European judges to restrict benefits tourism. Mr Clegg said on LBC Radio that we should go further to address the ‘absurd’ practice of paying child benefit to Europeans who live here but whose children are still abroad. The Deputy Prime Minister has told officials to look into a ‘fairer’ policy – although he conceded legal obstacles could be ‘difficult to straighten out’. Mr Cameron has promised to then hold an in-out referendum by 2017 if the Tories are still in power after the general election. Sir John told a foreign affairs think-tank in Berlin that a ‘great nation may be poised to leave the EU’ unless it is offered an opt-out from ‘ever-closer union’, reforms to free movement rights and legal guarantees that Brussels can only act where individual member states cannot. In what seems to be intended as a wake-up call to other EU leaders, he said: ‘Opposition has reached a critical mass and now, for the first time, there is a serious possibility that our electorate could vote to leave the EU. 'I put the chance of exit at just under 50 per cent. But if the negotiations go badly, that percentage will rise. 'Conversely, with genuine reform, it will fall. I ask our European partners to realise we are close to a breach that is in no-one’s interest.’ Sir John, who fought bitter battles with Eurosceptics when in Downing Street, appeared to rebuke Mr Cameron after he erupted over the EU budget at the last Brussels summit, suggesting it was time to ‘tone down the oratory and turn up the diplomacy’. However, he insisted that as large net contributors to the EU’s budget for 40 years, Britain expected the ‘national dilemma’ of seeking to control free movement ‘to be treated with consideration’. Labour leader Ed Miliband said Sir John's speech 'is a pretty damning indictment of David Cameron' ‘It is not too fanciful to say that our partners must weigh up a choice: help us on this issue, or deny us – knowing that the latter course can only fuel the Eurosceptic argument.’ Sir John stressed that migration across borders was not just a problem for the UK, arguing the ‘sheer volume of migration across Europe is alienating citizens from their governments’ in countries such as Greece, France and Italy. ‘It is powering the rise of single-issue political parties whose convictions are alien to a liberal and civilised society. 'Some are racist: others are border-line racist. Some are merely bigots,’ he added. Sir John went on to criticise Ukip, claiming the party is ‘anti-everything’. He continued: ‘They are anti-foreigner, they are anti-Europe, they’re anti-establishment, they’re anti-politics – I haven’t found out what they are for, but by goodness we know what they are against. 'A thoroughly negative body like that is not the place into which you should put your faith or your trust, and certainly not your vote.’ National Insurance numbers (NINOs) have been handed out to more than 420,000 people from the EU, up from 285,000 in the year before the coalition was formed . Labour leader Ed Miliband warned that leaving the EU would be a ‘disaster’, but claimed Mr Cameron was unwilling to take on his party’s Eurosceptics. ‘The Tory party is increasingly a party drifting towards exit from the EU – that is where the centre of gravity of the Tory party is,’ he said. Mr Miliband added that Sir John’s speech was a ‘damning indictment’ of the prime minister, who was ‘burning bridges and not helping Britain in Europe’.","Sir John Major said 'sheer scale of the influx' strained Britain's resources .

"A young father and veteran who lost all four of his limbs during his third tour in the Middle East is sharing his brave story of survival. Staff Sgt. Travis Mills, of Hallowell, Maine, was critically injured on April 10, 2012, when an improvised explosive device went off after he set down his ammunition bag, causing him to lose portions of both arms and legs. His injuries were so bad, he even sent away the medic attending to him away thinking he would die, saying, 'Get away from me, doc. You go save my men. Let me go. Save my men.' Now, Sgt. Mills, a quadruple amputee, has dedicated his life to inspiring others and helping other wounded and injured veterans. Scroll down for videos . Brave solider: Staff Sgt.

Tragedy: Sgt Mills (above) is one of only five soldiers to return from the Middle East a quadruple amputee, and now spends his time inspiring others by sharing his story of survival . In an interview with NBC Dallas, Sgt. Mills says he is just happy to be alive, and still can't believe he is still here to share his story. 'When I look back at it, I understand that I probably…I probably wasn't supposed to make it that day,' he said. In the interview he also made a point to say that though he is one of only five military members to return from battle in Afghanistan and Iraq as a quadruple amputee, he is no different from the thousands of other wounded vets. Helping out: Sgt. Mills (above with his wife, daughter and former President George W. Bush) has set up a non-profit to help other injured and wounded veterans . Movie star: Sgt. Mills will also be sharing his story in the new documentaryTravis: A Solider's Story . 'It's my story, but there are so many other guys out there like me,' he explained. That is why Sgt. Mills, 27, founded the Travis Mills Foundation, a nonprofit organization, formed to benefit and assist wounded and injured veterans. He also started Travis Mills Group, LLC where he consults with and speaks to companies and organizations nationwide, using his story to inspire others. And, as if that was not enough, he will also appear in a new documentary produced by Fotolanthropy about his life, Travis: A Solider's Story. The documentary features interviews with Travis and his wife Kelsey, detailing his horrific injury and the daily struggles and challenges he faces as a result of his life-altering injury. It also features his young daughter Chloe, who was born just months before Sgt. Mills left for Afghanistan. Shocking admission: In a recent interview, Sgt. Mills reveals that he probably was not supposed to make it out alive after the IED explosion . After his injury, Sgt. Mills dedicated himself to getting out of the hospital in 10 months so he could be reunited with his family - especially his young daughter. He admits in a preview for his documentary however, that he was still very much afraid of the future, saying, 'I was really worried about what life was going to be life afterward.' He also revealed that he immediately thought of his child after the explosion, thinking to himself, 'My baby girl, am I ever gonna see her again?' Humor: Sgt. Mills has kept his sense of humor through this all, recently convincing an interviewer (above) that she could get his hand to turn by gruffly saying 'turn tight' to his prosthetic arm . Doting dad: Sgt. Mills' wife Kelsey gave birth to their daughter Chloe (above) just months before the explosion that changed his life . Through all these difficulties and challenges though, Sgt. Mills still somehow manages to keep a sense of humor about everything, lightening even the tensest of moments. While speaking with NBC, he informed the woman interviewing him that he could make his prosthetic hand move on command by saying 'turn right.' He then urged her to try, telling her to make her voice more 'gruff' and lower each time to get it to work, though the hand never turned. Eventually the young woman realized, it was all a joke, and Sgt. Mills thanked her 'for playing.'","Staff Sgt.

Petraeus says military action in Syria is 'necessary' to deter other nations - like Iran and North Korea - from using similar weapons. While the president could have used military force in Syria without the approval of Congress, he opted to put the decision to a vote. Even if Congress doesn't approve the president's plan - which seems likely given the bi-partisan objections to intervening in yet another war in the Middle East - Obama still has the authority to launch an attack. Endorsement: Retired General and former CIA Director David Petraeus is urging Congress to approve Obama's plan for missile strikes in Syria . 'Failure of Congress to approve the president’s request would have . serious ramifications not just in the Mideast but around the world,' Petraeus said in a statement to POLITICO. President Obama is using gruesome footage that shows the carnage in the suburbs of Demascus following the August 21, attack, when the White House alleges Syrian President Bashar al-Assad launched sarin gas in areas considered to be rebel strongholds. In one of the more heartbreaking videos, a room is full of what appear to be the lifeless bodies of dozens of children. In another, men are seen foaming at the mouth and having convulsions. In all, 1,429 people were killed in the vicious attack, including at least 426 children. Petraeus, who is widely respected amongst lawmakers when it comes to military matters, could help persuade members of Congress to support the White House's plan for Syria. Horror: The Obama administration is showing videos that show dead children to congressmen to garner support for his plan for military intervention . Carnage: Authorities say 1,429 people were killed during the attack, including 426 children . 'Failure of Congress to approve the president’s request would have . serious ramifications not just in the Mideast but around the world. Military action against the Syrian regime is, thus, necessary not just . to deter future use of chemical weapons in Syria and elsewhere, but also . to ensure that Iran, North Korea and other would-be aggressors never . underestimate the United States’ resolve to take necessary military . action when other tools prove insufficient,' Petraeus said in the statement. Petraeus served as the U.S. commander for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan under former President George W. Bush and President Obama. He was tapped by Obama to be the director of the CIA in 2011 but was forced to resign after an affair he had with his biographer went public. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates also have publicly supported the president's call for military intervention in Syria. Support: President Obama and Secretary Kerry likely will not be able to get Congressional support for intervention in Syria . On Monday - when Congress is back in session - President Obama will sit for interviews with six different television networks in an attempt to win public support for his plan for Syria. The interviews will be conducted by ABC’s Diane Sawyer, CBS’s Scott . Pelley, CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, Fox’s Chris Wallace, NBC’s Brian Williams . and PBS’s Gwen Ifill. Congress is expected to vote on the matter later this week, as support for the president's plan continues to dwindle. President Obama last week canceled a trip to California so he could stay in Washington to continue lobbying for intervention in Syria. The president was scheduled to attend a $32,4000 a plate fundraiser at the home of Marta Kauffman, the co-creator of the NBC sitcom Friends.","Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .

"A kidnap gang who tortured a sauna boss after abducting him off the street has been jailed for more than 66 years. The criminals demanded £400,000 from Stefanos Neophytou after they took him to a house where they  threatened his family and said they would pour petrol and acid over him. The businessman, who was beaten and bound in chains, was only freed after promising to find £50,000 to pay off the gang who had warned they would 'do him in'. Scroll down for video . Masterminds: The operation was lead by Mahmoud Abouakkour (left), 21, and 32-year-old Tobias Uter (right) But he reported the incident to the police and detectives arrested two of the gang members when they arrived at a drop-off point to collect the money. Six gang members were jailed yesterday for more than 66 years after a month-long trial. The operation was lead by  Mahmoud Abouakkour, 21, and 32-year-old Tobias Uter, Birmingham Crown Court heard. Judge Roderick Henderson said the blackmail plot had been carried out by 'ruthless and determined people' and that 'significant planning and professionalism was involved.' He described the victim as an 'impressive and strong minded man' who ran the kind of business which 'attracted the attention of professional criminals.' He said: 'They demanded money from him, £400,000, which demonstrates the stakes for which these people were playing'. Jailed: Daniel Roberts was sentenced to nine years and 10 months. Karl Williams (right) was jailed for 13 years . The kidnapping took place on January 3 this year as Mr Neophytou was leaving the Libra Sauna Club near Hockley, Birmingham, and walking to his car, said prosecutor Michael Burrows QC. He was confronted by a hooded man and bundled into the back of a van, where a blanket was put over his head and his wrists tied. He was dragged out of the van into a house where a chain was put around his neck which was held so tight that he thought he was going to pass out, the court heard. He was forced upstairs and told to wait for the 'Big Man' who later arrived and told Mr Neophytou he knew everything about him and his family - before demanding £400,000 'tax' for protection. Criminals: Laura Lamb was jailed for five years and Daniel Wood was sentenced to six months . The Birmingham businessman stripped when he said he did not have the cash. Mr Burrows added: 'They said they had acid and petrol. He was aware of them putting some kind of bucket or barrel next to him and heard them ripping paper.' The victim was released when he eventually agreed to pay the thugs £50,000. He was put back into the van and dropped off in Ward End, Birmingham, in the early hours of the morning. He later told the gang he only had £20,000, which he said he would leave in a waste bin on January 7. Police arrested Abouakkour and Uter when they went to pick up the money. Abouakkour, of Birmingham, was found guilty of conspiracy to kidnap and blackmail and two charges of attempted intimidation and was jailed for 20 years. Sentenced: Members of the 'organised and determined' gang were jailed at Birmingham Crown Court, pictured . Uter, of Birmingham, had previously admitted conspiracy to kidnap and blackmail and was found guilty of two charges of attempted intimidation. He was jailed for 18 years and six months. Karl Williams, 36, of no fixed address, was convicted of attempted intimidation, possessing a firearm with intent and when prohibited and was jailed for 13 years. Daniel Roberts, 40, of Gloucester, who had also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to kidnap and blackmail, was handed a sentence of nine years and 10 months. Laura Lamb, 22, of Birmingham, was jailed for five years, after being found guilty of attempted intimidation and possessing a firearm with intent. Daniel Wood, 23, of Birmingham, who had admitted money laundering, was sentenced to six months. Detective inspector Tom Chisholm led the investigation to bring the gang to justice. He said: 'The defendants in this investigation were an organised and determined group, who went to considerable lengths to kidnap and blackmail the victim. 'We are committed to reducing serious and organised crime in the West Midlands and we are satisfied with the sentences handed to them, which reflect the grave nature of their offences. 'We also hope it shows that crime really does not pay and deters others from getting involved in such crimes.'","Stefanos Neophytou was abducted as he left his business in Birmingham .

"We feel so stupid: how could my wife and I have been conned out of more than £7,000 by one phone conversation? The answer is that the scam was brilliant in design and execution. It began with a phone call after dinner on a  Friday night. My wife answered the phone and the caller announced herself as ‘DCI Jane Seymour of the Serious Fraud Office’. The inspector was polite and matter of fact. She asked my wife if she had been in the Apple Store on Regent Street that day or the one in Covent Garden? My wife replied that she hadn’t. Deception: The fraudster pretended to be DCI and used a clever technical trick and 'brilliant' acting skills to con her victims . But DCI Seymour reported that someone . had bought expensive items from these stores using my wife’s debit card — . and the transactions had been within four minutes of each other. Anyone who knows central London knows it is almost impossible to get from Regent Street to Covent Garden in such a short time — something was definitely amiss. The inspector then broke the news that someone had cloned my wife’s card and was using it to make major purchases. Panicked  by this information, my wife called me over to the phone and asked me to speak to  DCI Seymour. The inspector explained that the Serious Fraud Office had been monitoring Apple Stores, conscious that the launch of the latest iPhone would make it a target for criminals. ‘Do you have all your cards with you?’ she asked. Yes. ‘Are you sure?’ Yes. In the background I could hear hubbub that made me think of TV’s The Bill or Prime Suspect: the faint sound of people chatting, the sense that DCI Seymour was at one desk and other detectives were hard at work on the case, too. Having established that neither my wife nor I had been to the Apple Store, she asked if I had noticed any strange transactions on my cards. No, I replied. Trick: The con-artist instructed the couple to phone but stayed on the line so the call went straight back through to her . ‘But we’re worried,’ said the inspector. ‘We think all your cards have been compromised. It may be that someone has hacked into the National Database. We need to block all the cards now.’ Inwardly, I shivered. Does this mean identity theft? ‘Yes, it could be. You’ll need to take part in a police investigation later. But we need to block your cards first.’ Immediately, I was suspicious. Why would she want all our cards? Was DCI Seymour who she said she was? How could we know she was really working for the Serious Fraud Office? Her ANSWER turned us from cautious sceptics into credulous fools. ‘Call 999 and check me out,’ she urged. So we did. I put the phone down, picked it up again and dialled 999. The dialling tone was normal, the phone rang and the response was as prompt and efficient as a law-abiding citizen could wish for. Which service did I want? The police. I’ll put you through. When a constable picked up the phone, I asked: ‘Do you have a DCI Jane Seymour of the Serious Fraud Squad?’ ‘Yes, I’ll connect you.’ DCI Seymour picked up the phone — her identity verified. In fishing parlance, we were hooked — and were about to be sunk. ‘We can have your cards blocked immediately,’ said DCI Seymour to reassure us. ‘New cards can be delivered to your house in three working days, or five for the foreign cards. But first we’ll need your PIN numbers.’ That should, of course, have rung alarm bells. How many times have we all been told, ‘Never, never give your PIN number to anyone. Your bank will never ask for it’? We hesitated — and this is where DCI Seymour scored again. ‘Don’t tell me the codes,’ she said. ‘Tap them into the phone and they will be sent straight to our technical team.’ And so, stupidly, but trusting that the . digital wizardry was in our interest, we did. And, as we later . discovered, using specialist technology, she recorded the numbers. Con: The scam depended on the couple believing the woman when she said their cards had been cloned . By this time, we had been on the phone for at least an hour, in a state of shock and growing despair over the hassles that apparently came with ID theft. DCI Seymour kept reassuring us that all would be well. ‘Are you OK? Do you have enough money for the weekend? We can get you emergency funds of £300 delivered to you by 3pm tomorrow. We’ll debit it from your HSBC account and I’ll call you again tomorrow at noon.’ It was all so comforting. Her  manner was solicitous, reassuring and practical. When I asked my wife to pour me a glass of wine, DCI Seymour heard me on the other end of the phone. She laughed and said she could do with one, too — but not on duty. Stressful call: The couple were completely taken in and their shock and despair grew as the conversation went on . And when she said she would send a courier round to pick up our compromised cards, it seemed so reasonable. ‘Put them in a sealed envelope inside another envelope, and don’t tell the driver what it’s for. We’ll contact him ourselves.’ Almost as if we had been hypnotised, we did as we were told. ‘The driver’s on his way. He’ll be with you shortly.’ He was and, within minutes, as we later discovered, our accounts were being plundered, mostly, it seems, by withdrawals from ATM machines at Euston station. Meanwhile, DCI Seymour kept me on the line, supposedly keeping us abreast of the activities of the criminals who had cloned our cards. ‘There’s been a withdrawal in South London. Someone’s at Euston. We’re watching the CCTV. There’s another withdrawal . . .’ On and on it went, as my wife and I became increasingly tired and desperate, but DCI Seymour kept us hanging on, saying: ‘Don’t put the phone down. Stay on the line.’ I realise now, of course, that this was to stop us ringing the banks of our own accord. At around  midnight, my wife collapsed into bed, but DCI Seymour kept me on the phone until 1.30am. I had been speaking to her for two-and-a-half hours. To say we slept badly is an understatement. We tossed and turned, fretting about the money being siphoned out of our accounts. Breakfast and the cold light of day brought me to my senses. ‘Perhaps, I should call 999 again, just to check,’ I thought. 'Hypnotised': The couple did everything 'DCI Seymour' asked of them after they were taken in by the con . The operator who answered was annoyed. She told me my case was not an emergency and I should dial 101 for my local police service. With mounting anxiety, I explained that I had dialled 999 the night before and that my call had been put through to an officer. ‘We have no record of a call,’ she said. ‘Ah, hang on a moment. I’ll talk to a colleague.’ And then, with the help of bona fide officers, the truth about the scam was revealed. It all hinged on a clever technical trick. Quite simply, if you put the phone down, but the other party does not, they stay on the line. Even if you dial a new number, you remain connected to the original caller. So when I dialled 999, it went back to ‘DCI Jane Seymour’. She must have had an accomplice posing as the emergency services operator and, as easy as that, we fell into their trap. Hi-tech: Specialist technology allowed the fraudster to record the pin numbers as they were entered into the phone . The Payments Council, responsible for card security, says there has been a three-fold increase this year in incidents of this scam. In the first quarter of 2012, an estimated £750,000 was lost. In total, we lost around £7,000 of our savings. The police — the real police — have been sympathetic and tell us that the con is targeted at the well-to-do and the elderly who may not be as techno-savvy as younger account holders. Mercifully, most of the money has since been credited back to us. The banks conceded we were victims of an understandable gullibility. Initially, only French bank BNP failed to reimburse us, but eventually (after an anguished protest on my part), it, too, paid up. Naturally, my wife and I feel embarrassed and a little sheepish at having been fooled so easily. In our defence, I can only say that the woman who played ‘DCI Jane Seymour’ was a brilliant actress and this particular bit of financial con-artistry was new to us. We are lucky the damage done wasn’t permanent and that most of the money has been returned. Others may not be so lucky. I may feel shame-faced about  having been so easily deceived, but let my gullibility be a very modern cautionary tale to others.","The con began with phone call from woman claiming to be an inspector .

"Rant: Dictator Robert Mugabe said his country would never support gay rights . Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe said 'to hell with you' to David Cameron in a speech after the Prime Minister called for global rights. The 88-year-old tyrant used a speech at his birthday party yesterday to urge Zimbabweans to shun Western values and homosexuality. His comments came after Mr Cameron last year warned Britain could withdraw aid from developing countries which failed to protect gay rights. Mugabe, who has ranted about homosexuality for years, has previously branded gays ‘worse than dogs’. The dictator said his government entirely rejected the suggestion from its former colonial master. He said: 'We reject that outright and say to hell with you. 'You, David Cameron, are you suggesting that you don’t know that, or is it some kind of insanity or part of the culture of Europeans?' During his speech, which was broadcast by Zimbabwe’s state-owned television network, Mugabe added that he would never allow gay rights in his country. He said: 'In their newspapers, that’s one of my sins. That I called (gays) worse than pigs and dogs because pigs know there are males and females. 'I won’t even call him a dog because my own dog will complain. 'It’s even in the Bible that you create through the system of marrying. That’s how we were born, so we reject that outright and say to hell with you. Celebrations: Dictator Robert Mugabe eats cake yesterday as he marks his 88th birthday - with an attack on Western values . 'You are free as a man to marry a woman and that is what we follow. 'That’s what produced you and me. This kind of insanity is now part of the culture of Europe and the United States.' Mugabe’s rambling speech came as he addressed a crowd of around 20,000 supporters during a birthday rally in the eastern city of Mutare. The aging dictator turned 88 last Tuesday and celebrated yesterday with a lavish party. Local . media reported that a massive birthday cake was baked for the event in . Harare and driven the 160 miles to Mutare under a police escort. Members of Zimbabwe’s ruling Zanu-PF who attended the celebration were also treated to musical performances from local bands. Anti-discrimination drive: Mr Cameron said last year that any developing country that fails to support gay rights could have their aid withdrawn . Meanwhile several cattle were slaughtered to provide food for the event, which was reportedly funded by businesses loyal to the ruling party. The scale of Mugabe’s birthday celebrations have sparked outrage in Zimbabwe, where millions live in poverty following years of disastrous economic mismanagement. However the president appeared typically unrepentant as he gave his speech, during which he also called for fresh elections to end a power-sharing government with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change. His comments about homosexuality came after Mr Cameron told a conference of Commonwealth leaders in October that Britain could cut aid to developing nations which failed to protect human rights, including gay rights. Homosexuality is illegal in Zimbabwe and two members of the same sex caught kissing or even holding hands can face a jail sentence. Mugabe, a devout Catholic, has repeatedly said he believed same-sex relationships were morally wrong and has criticised MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai for backing gay rights.",Mugabe attacks Western values in rambling birthday speech .
"Each year we spend £2.5 billion on over-the-counter medicines from chemists, corner shops and supermarkets, a figure that has been growing by nearly 10 per cent annually. Yet emerging evidence suggests many of these pills and lotions are utterly useless — and some can actually make our health worse. Anthony Cox, a clinical pharmacy lecturer at Birmingham University, claims that by selling such products, High Street chemists are ‘endorsing quackery’ in the pursuit of profits. ‘Community pharmacists should stop selling over-the-counter medicines that have little evidence of efficacy,’ he wrote in The Pharmaceutical Journal in August. Scroll down for video . Emerging evidence suggests many  over-the-counter medicines from chemists, corner shops and supermarkets are utterly useless — and some can actually make our health worse . Even some of the biggest-selling products have no scientific basis to prove they work. Here, we identify several of the items you don’t need in your bathroom cabinet. COUGH MEDICINE . What we spend a year: £96 million . What does everyone do when they get a cough? They go out and buy some cough medicine, of course. Yet there is little, if any proof, that it will help you recover. Dr Tim Ballard, vice-chairman of the Royal College Of General Practitioners, says: ‘The medical evidence behind cough medicines is weak, and there’s no evidence they’ll reduce the duration of illnesses.’ If your cough is caused by a viral infection, as coughs most commonly are, there is no quick way of getting rid of it — you simply have to wait for the immune system to clear the virus. Cough medicines won’t speed up this process, no matter what ‘wonder’ ingredients are proclaimed on the package. The NHS Choices website suggests cough sufferers make their own remedy of honey and lemon . A review of 17 studies involving 2,876 adults and eight studies involving 616 children by the influential Cochrane Collaboration in 2008 found no robust evidence that dextromethorphan or diphenhydramine — two common ingredients in over-the-counter cough medicines — helped. Anthony Cox warns some costly cough medicines may even be harmful. ‘The drug combinations they contain can be illogical — such as an expectorant, which produces mucus, with a cough suppressant, which quashes the urge to eject mucus,’ he says. ‘These are often more likely to bring about an adverse effect, such as drowsiness and nausea, or no effect.’ A spokesman for the Proprietary Association of Great Britain, which represents makers of over-the-counter drugs, says: ‘Cough medicines will not “cure” a cough, but they can help relieve the symptoms.’ The NHS Choices website suggests cough sufferers make their own remedy of honey and lemon. ‘The honey is a demulcent, which means it coats the throat and relieves the irritation that causes coughing,’ it says. The lemon is there only to add sharpness to the flavour. EAR-WAX REMOVER . What we spend a year: £7.8 million . A bottle of eardrops from the chemist may contain impressive-sounding ingredients such as glycerol and urea hydrogen peroxide to help loosen or dissolve wax. There is, however, no good clinical evidence to show these work any better than simply putting water in your ear to soften wax, according to a study by the Cochrane Ear, Nose And Throat Disorders Group. Its study in 2009, led by Martin Burton, an otolaryngologist (ear, nose and throat specialist) at the Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals NHS Trust, concluded: ‘Saline or water seems to be as effective as any over-the-counter agent. And both have the virtue of being cheap and readily available.’ ANTIHISTAMINES FOR INSOMNIA . What we spend a year: £42.5 million . Many over-the-counter sleep-aid pills contain the antihistamine diphenhydramine. This is commonly used to quell allergic reactions and has the side-effect of drowsiness. However, there is no scientific evidence to support its usefulness for treating insomnia. Indeed, the NHS Choices website warns: ‘Good evidence of diphenhydramine’s efficacy is lacking.’ Many over-the-counter sleep-aid pills contain the antihistamine diphenhydramine. This is commonly used to quell allergic reactions and has the side-effect of drowsiness . There are only two robust clinical studies that have tested its effectiveness in treating insomnia. The first, published in the journal Sleep in 2005, compared a sleep-aid dose of diphenhydramine with a placebo pill in 20 elderly insomniacs. The participants reported no difference in how long they took to drop off to sleep, how well they slept or for how long. The second study, in the same journal report, examined 184 adults with mild insomnia. Automated readings of their brain, eye and muscle activity found that taking diphenhydramine had no more effect than placebo pills. Diphenhydramine’s other side-effects can include dry mouth, dizziness, headaches, constipation and urinary retention. PAIN-RELIEF RUBS WITH ASPIRIN . What we spend a year: £20 million . The active ingredient in aspirin, salicylate, is proven to reduce pain and inflammation when swallowed. But that does not mean it is effective in a skin rub for muscle aches. The idea is that by putting the painkiller next to the strained muscle, it soothes the area faster and more effectively. However, a comprehensive review of research by the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews in 2009 found little evidence that over-the-counter pain-relieving creams containing salicylate have any effect on muscle aches and pains when compared with a sham placebo cream. Dr Andrew Moore, an Oxford University biochemist who led the review, concluded that such creams are a waste of money. Those containing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory painkiller gels, such as ibuprofen or diclofenac, work considerably better, he said. INSECT-BITE CREAMS . What we spend a year: £14 million . There are dozens of over-the-counter creams and pills to relieve itching and swelling caused by insect bites — but there is little evidence they do much to help. There is no solid evidence the £14 million we spend each year on insect bite creams and pills to relieve itching and swelling. do much to help . Creams that contain painkillers or anaesthetics, or those with antihistamines and antiseptics, are only ‘marginally effective’, according to a review by the Drug And Therapeutics Bulletin in 2012. It warned that these chemical-laden creams can make skin even more sensitive. Other options include steroid tablets and ointments, such as hydrocortisone. But once again there is no solid evidence to suggest they work, unless the people using them suffer from reactive skin conditions such as eczema, the journal reported. A simple antiseptic cream can have a soothing ‘kiss-it-better’ effect for a child with an insect bite, as well as being an infection-fighting precaution. ANTIBACTERIAL SOAPS AND WIPES . What we spend a year: £239 million . Although it seems common sense that antibacterial soap can protect ourselves and our families from illness caused by bacteria, this is not what the evidence shows. More than four decades of research by the U.S. government’s Food And Drug Administration, along with numerous independent studies, have produced no evidence that triclosan, the active ingredient in many antibacterial soaps, hand gels and wipes, has any health benefits over old-fashioned soap and water. One basic problem is that antibacterial soaps specifically target bacteria rather than viruses. But it is viruses that cause the majority of illnesses, such as colds and flu. The most effective scientifically proven way to keep bacteria at bay is regular hand-washing with ordinary soap, along with good food hygiene in the kitchen. Antibacterial soaps may actually cause health problems, too. Evidence shows children with prolonged exposure to triclosan over months or years have a greater chance of developing allergies, including peanut allergies and hay fever, according to studies in the Journal of Allergy And Clinical Immunology in 2012, and in Environmental Health Perspectives in 2011. This may be due to the fact that youngsters who use antibacterial soaps and cleansers reduce their exposure to bacteria. But the bugs may be essential for training their developing immune systems to respond appropriately to potential infections and allergens. WHITENING TOOTHPASTES . What we spend a year: £60 million . More than 40 per cent of us use whitening toothpastes — even though they often cost three times more than standard toothpaste. More than 40 per cent of us use whitening toothpastes, at a cost of £60 million a year, but investigators at the Cochrane Oral Health Group said there is a complete lack of clinical studies to back up makers' claims . The pastes purport to work by bleaching or being abrasive. However, investigators at the Cochrane Oral Health Group complained last February there is a complete lack of clinical studies to back up makers’ claims. Some of these products proclaim that they use hydrogen peroxide as a bleaching agent to whiten out stains. But Dr Nigel Carter, chief executive of the British Dental Health Foundation, says: ‘Toothpastes sold in the EU can legally contain only 0.1 per cent hydrogen peroxide, in order to be safe. ‘The chance of that amount having an effect on teeth is virtually non-existent. You need at least 30 times that to achieve anything.’","£2.5 billion is spent on over-the-counter medicines including cough medicines, whitening toothpastes, insect bite relief and insomnia remedies .

"So does one still rule the waves? That may have been the question asked by the Queen yesterday - and the unimpressed look that followed may have revealed the answer . She may well have been concerned to learn how much Britain's naval might has diminished since 1977. Her Majesty was being shown a chart outlining the current strength of the Royal Navy at Whitehall's Admiralty House as the Duke of Edinburgh finally received his birthday present. Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh (right) are shown a map by First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope (centre) during a visit to Admiralty House in central London . The Duke was given  the office of titular head of the Navy, for his 90th on June 10. For a man who has achieved much in his years the Queen may have been in a quandary as to what to get her husband. But as a former Navy officer it was fitting the title of Lord High Admiral of the Navy - which dates back to the 14th century - was chosen as a gift. Philip gave up his promising career on the seas to devote his life to Royal duty and support his wife in her role as Sovereign. And yesterday at Admiralty House, the former home of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, the Duke received the Letters Patent as the holder of the title, as the Queen watched. In the 18th century building's Admiralty Boardroom - where Nelson attended meetings and the Navy Board still meets today - Philip saw the formal document. Prince Philip takes the salute during his visit to the Admiralty Board and Admiralty House, where he formally received Letters Patent as the holder of the title and office of Lord High Admiral . Prince Philip and the Queen were treated to a display of precision drumming by five members of the Royal Marines Corps of Drummers . He listened intently as a senior naval officer gave a brief speech on the history of the title which had been held by the Queen since 1964 until this summer. When the description turned to the previous holder before the Queen, the Duke of Clarence, later William IV, Philip laughed when told that the royal had argued with his advisory council 'and when in 1828 he led a squadron out for manoeuvres without consulting either his council, the King or the Duke of Wellington and was gone, no one knew where, for 10 days it proved too much and he was asked to resign'. During the event, Philip was wearing a flesh-coloured plaster on both ears above the lobe, but a Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said she did not believe it was anything serious. Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope, the First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff, hosted the event, which featured senior naval officers as well as rank-and-file sailors. The Duke of Edinburgh studying in the section room at the Naval College Greenwich . Philip and the Queen watched a display of precision drumming by five members of the Royal Marines Corps of Drummers in the courtyard outside the building and also attended a reception for senior naval officers and ordinary servicemen before having lunch with the Navy's top brass. The Duke is an admiral of the fleet and the military uniform he wore today is the same outfit he was dressed in on his wedding day in 1947. The birthday gift from the Queen could be seen as a touching acknowledgement of the sacrifices the Duke has made for his wife. Had . he not become the monarch's husband, some believe he would have been . First Sea Lord, the professional head of the Royal Navy. In an ITV interview to mark his 90th year, he was asked how he felt giving up his job as a Royal Navy officer. 'I . don't know how difficult it was, it was naturally disappointing,' he . replied. 'I had just been promoted to commander and the fact was that . the most interesting part of my naval career was just starting.' By-gone age: The might of the British Navy was there for all to see at Gosport and Southsea in 1977 for the Queen's Silver Jubilee . As part of the 1977 celebrations, the Queen reviewed the Fleet at Spithead on board The Royal Yacht Britannia . Philip joined the Navy after leaving school and in May 1939 enrolled at the Royal Naval College, in Dartmouth, where he was singled out as best cadet. He rose rapidly through the ranks, earning promotion after promotion, but his life was to take a very different course. During the Second World War, Philip served with the Mediterranean and Pacific fleets, and reached the rank of commander before his flourishing naval career came to a premature end in 1951. The health of his father-in-law George VI was deteriorating and Queen-in-waiting Princess Elizabeth was required to take on more royal responsibilities. Philip stepped down from his active role in the forces to fulfil his duty as her consort. His wife acceded to the throne within the year when the King died in February 1952.

"Some people swear they can't wake up in the morning without a strong coffee, while others prefer to start the day with a nice pot of tea. But with the benefits and dangers of regularly consuming these drinks hotly debated each week, which is better for us? Now, a new graphic pitting the two against each other claims coffee and tea are good for you in different ways. Scroll down for video . The new  graphic has drawn together research on the health benefits of both coffee and tea . One study found that coffee didn't have any overall benefits for health but did no harm, while tea had clear benefits. Coffee, however, does contains more caffeine than tea . The graphic shows little known facts about tea and coffee, such as that white tea may help prevent obesity and coffee drinkers are less likely to suffer Alzheimer's . It draws together the key facts from recent studies about the health benefits of coffee and tea, giving connoisseurs of both a reason to stick to their favourite drink. It says tea may prevent the development of type 1 diabetes, cut the risk of a heart attack and protect against obesity, heart disease and cancer. People who drank black tea four times a day for six weeks were found to have lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol, one study found. However, adding milk to the tea may stop the benefits it has against cancer, according to other research. It’s also possible tea could contain pesticides - even if it is labelled organic - and contains a large amount of tannin, which reduces the absorption of iron in the blood, which can cause anaemia. And while green tea is often hailed as the healthy option, health-conscious tea drinkers might want to opt for white tea, which is made from the buds and young leaves of the tea bush. White tea has been found to have a higher concentration of antioxidants in it which may actually be more effective preventing some diseases than green tea. Tea and coffee are both known to have health benefits and known risks. Here, the benefits for tea are pictured on the left in green, and the risks pictured in red. The benefits of drinking coffee are pictured on the right in green, while the risks are similarly pictured in red . TEA . Drinking three to four cups of tea a day can cut the chance of a heart attack . Helps prevent type 1 diabetes and slow its progression once it has developed . People who drink black tea four times a day for six weeks were found to have lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol . Contains fluoride which protects teeth . Men who drink more than 10 cups of green tea per day are less likely to develop disorders of the liver . Green tea may protect against lung cancer . Green tea reduces the risk of oesophageal cancer in women by 60 per cent . Green and white tea contains anti-oxidants which may have anti-ageing potential . White tea can help prevent obesity . Tea is hydrating . Tea may contain pesticides, even if it’s been labelled as organic . Tea contains a large amount of tannin. Tanin reduces the absorption of iron in the body which can lead to anaemia. Tea contains caffeine which has been proven to cause anxiety and rises in blood pressure . Adding milk may also stop the benefits tea has against cancer . COFFEE . Helps prevent type 2 diabetes . Protects against the liver, especially cirrhosis (liver damage) and liver cancer . Decrease the risk of gout in men over 40 . Reduces risk of Alzheimer's disease . Reduces the risk of dying of heart disease . Improves short term memory and reaction times . Chemicals found in coffee could be used to make new drugs to treat heart disease and insomnia . Caffeine in coffee increases the effectiveness of painkillers . Causes tooth discolouration . Drinking eight or more cups a fay significantly increased the risk of stillbirths. Decreases blood flow to the heart . Over 1000 chemicals have been found in roasted coffee with 19 being known carcinogens . The antioxidants in white tea have anti-ageing potential, may help prevent some cancers as well as inflammation and heart disease . White tea could also help prevent obesity, as it was found to inhibit the growth of new fat cells. While studies found that drinking tea when it is too hot increased the risk of oesophageal cancer, green tea reduces the risk of oesophageal cancer in women by 60 per cent. Meanwhile, some studies did find that coffee - normally thought to be the less healthy drink of the two - does have some health benefits. It can prevent type 2 diabetes, reduce the risk of gout in middle aged men, stave off Alzheimer’s disease and protect against liver damage (known as cirrhosis) and liver cancer in men. It showed coffee also increases the effectiveness of painkillers and improves short term memory and reaction times, especially in the elderly. Scientists now believe that chemicals found in coffee could be used to make new drugs to treat heart disease and insomnia. But other research has shown coffee decreases blood flow to the heart and causes tooth discolouration. Filter coffee contains almost 150 mg of caffeine a cup, whereas black tea contains less than 70 mg . A study in Denmark found that drinking eight or more cups of coffee a day significantly increased the risk of stillbirths. For those who find ‘tea or coffee’ a question too far first thing in the morning, relief may soon be on hand – a combination of both. Researchers claim they have discovered the ultimate brew – a tea made from coffee leaves which is healthier than both of the drinks. The coffee leaf tea, which is said to have an ‘earthy’ taste that is less bitter than tea and not as strong as coffee, boasts high levels of compounds which lower the risk of diabetes and heart disease, experts said. It also carries far less caffeine than traditional tea or coffee and contains antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The coffee leaves were analysed by researchers from the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, South-West London, together with researchers in Montpellier, France. However, most of the research was based on black coffee with a little milk or sugar, rather than the high calorie coffee drinks found in high-street coffee shops. Dr Duane Mellor, assistant professor of dietetics at the university of Nottingham, said these were well-known studies and added that he doesn't advise his clients to give up tea or coffee. 'They are a better alternative than sugary soft drinks,' he said. However, he warned against the high sugar drinks masquerading as 'coffee'. A recent MailOnline investigation found the majority of Christmas drinks from popular chain coffee shops contain more than a person's daily recommended sugar intake in one medium-sized portion. Dr Mellor continued: 'A latte with syrup can be a lot of extra sugar, energy, fat. It makes it a very different drink.' He added that it is a myth that coffee and tea are dehydrating. 'If you go from drinking none to a lot, the caffeine might make a difference, but if you have a regular intake of caffeine it’s not a problem,' he said. And he wasn't able to choose one over the other: ‘Both have benefits and people should go for what they prefer. 'It used to be the tea had the strong arguments for health, but with more research coming out about coffee, there’s not much in it now.’ The graphic was created by Policy Expert.","Coffee and tea are good for you in different ways, studies show .

"This is the painful moment a man infested with parasitic ‘jigger’ fleas is forced to have them cut out of his foot with a scalpel. The man's foot is massively swollen and disfigured, having been plagued with jiggers for years, leaving him unable to walk. The skin on his foot is flaky and pitted from previous infestations. Scroll down for video . A man infested with 'jigger' fleas is forced to have them cut out of his foot with a scalpel . Jigger, or chigoe fleas, common in Sub-Saharan Africa, burrow into human flesh and lay pea-sized egg sacs. The resulting wounds can lead to infections like gangrene and hepatitis . Jigger fleas cause swelling, ulceration, itching and infections and the pain leaves many people with walking problems. The only way to remove the jiggers is to cut them out of the feet - usually with no anaesthetic . Jiggers, or chigoe fleas, are sand fleas found in Sub-Saharan climates that burrow into the skin and lay eggs. They cause swelling, itching and infection which can lead to amputation and even death in the worst cases. A healthcare worker cuts away nodules where the jiggers have buried into the man’s foot, wiping away the flea and the surrounding pus and blood with cotton wool. Cutting the fleas out of the foot and soaking it in alcohol or another disinfectant is the only way to treat the disease once an infestation has occurred. Cutting out the jiggers is a painful process, and often all the jiggers cannot be removed in one sitting. In Kenya, an estimated 1.4 million people (translating to four per cent of the total population) suffer from jigger infestation. Jiggers  are small chigoe fleas that live in the dust, and are found on the dirt floors in schools and the homes of many families in Uganda and other similar climates. These parasitic insects cling to livestock and transfer jiggers into homes primarily in rural areas. The female jiggers burrow into the surface of skin that has been exposed to the flea. Once embedded in the body, the jigger lays eggs and creates up to pea-size egg sacks and continues to multiply by laying more eggs. These wounds are painful, and cause difficulties for victims in daily activities such as walking, playing, and attending school. The infection can lead to severe inflammation, ulceration and fibrosis. It can also cause lymphangitis, gangrene, sepsis, and the loss of toenails, amputation of the digits, and death may also occur. There is also a social stigma and shame associated with the victims of jiggers which causes them to hide the problem which makes it worse. While jiggers in small numbers are not deadly, the secondary infections (gangrene, tetanus and other diseases) caused by jiggers can be fatal. Source: Sole Hope . They leave most victims unable to walk work, or carry out any activities such as going to school. Areas of Uganda, Tanzania and other African countries with similar climates also have large areas of infestation. The female jiggers burrow into the skin, usually of the hands and feel, and lay egg sacks which can grow up to the size of a pea. The flea continue to multiply by laying more eggs, causing an infection which leads the body to become ulcerated and inflamed. It can also cause lymphangitis- a swelling of the lymph nodes, as well as gangrene, tetanus and blood poisoning. Victims often lose their toenails and are forced to have their digits amputated. While in small numbers jiggers are not deadly, the secondary infections such as gangrene and tetanus can be fatal. There is also a social stigma and shame associated with the victims of joggers which causes them to hide the problem, making it worse. Patients often use the same scalpel or pin to cut out the jiggers, therefore infections such as HIV/Aids are passed from person to person. Jiggers also burrow into the skin of animals like dogs, cats, rats, pigs, cattle and sheep, so people living in rural areas are likely to catch them. But they are also found in the dust and on dirt floors of many homes and schools. For a complete eradication of the bug, thorough fumigation of homes, schools and animals need to take place. Charities in infected regions also encourage the local populations to wear shoes and observe cleanliness to prevent future infestations.

"Within the next 30 years, the global population is set to increase by almost 3 billion up to 10 billion, and this rise is set to put a heavy burden on the healthcare industry. Futurologist Peter Cochrane has predicted how he believes the world will cope with this extra demand, and which technologies are set to revolutionise medical treatment over the next 25 years. His forecasts include lighting that helps people recover from illness, virtual surgeries and wearables that detect cancer molecules. Scroll down for video . Futurologist Peter Cochrane has predicted how he believes the world will cope with an ageing and increasing population over the next 25 years, and which technologies are set to revolutionise medical treatment . The claims were made in Mr Cochrane’s Future Technologies of Health and Care, Wellbeing and Transformation report, commissioned by Philips Innovation. It also addressed how traditional job roles will evolve. The claims were made in Peter Cochrane’s (pictutred) Future Technologies of Health and Care, Wellbeing and Transformation report . Peter Cochrane believes that technology is easing people away from ‘mass medicine and treatment’ into a more focused world of personalised medicine targeted at the individual, whether that be at home or in public hospitals. Sensors will soon be able to relief pain, as well as detect cancer and other chemical inbalances in the body. Material, food, water and energy waste will be reduced thanks to the so-called Clouds of Things, where everything is tracked, has sensors, and can communicate with each other. And within 25 years, Mr Cochrane said jobs such as bankers, receptionists, call centre and warehouse operatives, will become redundant, with occupations such as 'cyborg engineers' and 'crime predictors' becoming common. ‘[Population figures] sound bleak, but the reality is that technology has satisfied all our desires and needs and we’ve never been in a better position than we are today,’ said Mr Cochrane. ‘I’ve looked at how human needs will impact on innovation, both now and in the future.’ Mr Cochrane explained that all the complex technology of medical care is currently concentrated in hospitals, but it is gradually heading to the doctor’s office. This will then head to bathroom cabinets, and in the future, people are increasingly going to be looking after their own health, using apps or virtual surgeries. The NetDoctors website, for example, already offers virtual appointments with doctors, so patients can discuss conditions or problems, ask queries about an odd-looking rash or seek advice when they can’t get an appointment with their GP. Dr Sirfraz Hussain, a GP at the Moss Side Family Practice in Manchester, similarly uses Skype to consult with his patients and said they have ‘revolutionised’ his practice by cutting waiting times. According to the report, these advancements prove that technology is moving away from mass medical treatment into a more ‘focused, personalised approach targeted at the individual.’ ‘Whether at home, or in public hospitals many of the big expensive machines and laboratory facilities associated with hospitals are being miniaturised, simplified and migrated to the doctors’ surgery and in turn will soon be seen in our bathroom cabinets,’ continued the report. It also explained that a new range of sensors could one day promise everything from non-invasive scanning, to pheromone analysis capable of detecting the early onset of some cancers and other diseases. These in theory could be placed inside wearable devices such as a wristband. There are already a number of skin cancer apps available, too, that claim to be able to analyse and assess moles based on size and shape, including Doctor Mole and DermoScreen. Elsewhere, Philips has been working with devices including Pulse Relief - a gadget that tracks an individual’s pain, and monitors how it affects their life. The Future Technologies of Health and Care, Wellbeing and Transformation report, by futurologist Peter Cochrane looks at how medical trends will revolutionise healthcare by 2040, His predictions include the rise of blue LEDs, virtual surgeries and appointments (pictured), and sensors that detect cancer molecules . While blue LED light technology, which recently won the Nobel Prize in Physics, is used in products such as Blue Touch, a wearable blue LED light pain patch. Philips BlueTouch uses blue LED lights to stimulate the body’s natural production of nitric oxide. Mr Cochrane also believes that in the near future, we will be able to 3D print replacement body parts . This boosts circulation and increases the spread of oxygen and nutrients through the body to treat mild to moderate pains. The report went on to say that our homes and hospitals will look different in the future meaning our environments will help with recovery, in addition to medical technologies. Lighting and sound, for example, is being experimented with to see how changes in hues, or noise, can help a patient heal or recover quicker. And these rooms can ‘adapt’ to respond to any changes. Another such innovation in offices, hotels and public buildings is carpets that provide information and directions through the combination of LED lighting and light-transmissive materials. Lighting is also being used to boost food production. For example, an indoor farm in Japan uses 17,500 LED lights spread over 18 cultivation racks, and these lights are used to mimic day and night. By monitoring the photosynthesis process carefully, the system grows lettuce two-and-a-half times faster than an outdoor farm. It also cuts waste product by 40 per cent and productivity per square foot is up 100-fold. Purple lighting is used to mimic night, . for example, while the white lights are adjusted slowly throughout the . day to mimic a sun moving through the sky. And home lighting, including examples such as Philips Hue and LiFx, can now alert users if there is someone at the door, flash when a favourite team scores a goal, or change colour when a text message is received. Philips, for example, has been working with devices including Blue Touch (pictured). It uses blue LED lights, which recently won the Nobel Prize in Physics, to detect and relieve back pain. It uses the lights to stimulate the body’s natural production of nitric oxide to boost circulation and the spread of oxygen around the body . Technology, and in particular smart lighting, is similarly being used to tackle food shortages and waste. For example, an indoor farm in Japan uses 17,500 LED lights (pictured) to mimic day and night. By monitoring photosynthesis process carefully, the system grows lettuce two-and-a-half times faster than an outdoor farm . They can also be remotely controlled to protect houses when homeowners are on holiday, for example. Finally, the report looked at how jobs will change and evolve thanks to advances in technology. In the next 25 years, jobs such as bankers, receptionists, call centre and warehouse operatives, stock traders, train drivers, pilots and even journalists are expected to change, said Mr Cochrane, as innovations develop to respond to human needs. And home lighting, including examples such as Philips Hue (pictured left) and LiFx (pictured right), can now alert users if there is someone at the door, flash when a favourite team scores a goal, or change colour when a text message is received to make our lives easier . Finally, the report looked at how jobs will change and evolve thanks to advances in technology. In the next 25 years, Mr Cochrane believes new jobs will be created, such as ‘cyborg engineers’, ‘crime predictors’ - similar to those seen in film Minority Report (Tom Cruise pictured) - and ‘information caretakers’ Mr Cochrane believes this will result in the creation of as yet unheard of jobs such as ‘cyborg engineers’, ‘crime predictors’ – similar to those seen in film Minority Report - and ‘information caretakers.’ Twitter and Facebook is often praised for increasing awareness, and boosting so-called 'citizen journalism', but Mr Cochrane said that this also increases the spread of misinformation. He predicts that this will additionally lead to the rise of 'truth engines', that act like search engines but only show verified information. ‘When confronted by any new technology we should ask one vital question - what benefit will it bring to my life? And the answer should guide our decision to embrace or avoid,’ concluded Mr Cochrane.","Report was written by futurologist Peter Cochrane and Philips Innovation .

"Angella Johnson gave up alcohol for the experiment . A few cups of coffee, an evening glass of wine, and saying yes to dessert – can these everyday pleasures be considered vices? Increasingly, doctors suggest we would be healthier if we didn’t indulge so regularly. New NHS guidelines announced last month suggest that those who drink just a couple of large glasses of wine a night should be offered drug addiction medication to help them break the habit. There is also a concerted push to reduce our sugar consumption, and coffee has been strongly linked to the rising incidence of anxiety disorders, which now affect one in 20 of the population. Javed Sabir, the Pathology Clinical Lead at BMI Healthcare, says that even short breaks from such common vices will yield health benefits and could break the cycle of regarding so-called treats such as chocolate, wine and coffee as rewards. ‘These may seem like harmless things to help get you through the  day or a reward in the evening, but we don’t realise just how much damage they are doing to our bodies in the long term.’ He adds: ‘Giving up some of these common vices, even for just a few months, can make a big difference to your health, as our experiment shows. ‘It’s easier said than done for most of us and it’s only when you try to give them up that you realise they are very real addictions. ‘As with our three guinea pigs, what can often happen is that one addictive substance is replaced with another. ‘Of course, to see long-term benefits you have to sustain that good work and keep motivated. Our volunteers underwent a battery of health checks as part of a BMI Healthcare advanced assessment (bmihealthcare.co.uk) which measured their weight, blood pressure, body fat percentage, blood glucose levels, and waist/height ratio. They then gave up their chosen ‘vice’ for three months. Each was offered sessions of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), a psychological treatment recommended by the NHS to help support addicts, but encouraged to make no other changes to their lifestyle. At the end of the experiment, they were tested again. Their results were analysed by nutritional therapist Jackie Lynch (well-well-well. co.uk) and personal trainer Scott Laidler. ‘That can be a real challenge and sticking to everything in moderation may be a more sustainable lifestyle change.’ I'm back in control and looking much better . Angella Johnson , who is in her 40s, is single and lives in London. She says: ‘In recent years I’ve found myself drinking more. At first it was to help ease the stress of the day, but it became a habit as my nightly tipple increased to two or three glasses. ‘I wanted to feel in control once more, and it was surprisingly easy for the first four days. But after that I started to crave a large glass of chilled white wine. I stayed home in the evenings to avoid temptation. ‘By week two the sight of someone drinking on TV or just reading about it in a book brought on the thirst. I drank coconut water by the litre. When I ventured out, I stuck valiantly to mineral water. For a treat I drank spicy Virgin Marys, but I yearned for alcohol. ‘I chose not to have CBT – I prefer to be left to my own devices. The end of week three left me feeling more comfortable, but envy still hit me in a social settings where others were drinking. At home, quality chocolates were my late-night replacement. ‘After six weeks, during which I thought of drinking at least once a day, friends and colleagues started to point out that my eyes were clearer, my face was less puffy, and that I had lost weight. I realised I was feeling more energetic. It was vanity that made me continue because I cannot say that it got any easier. Clearly my addiction had deep roots. It’s six weeks since I started drinking again and I have reset the valve. When I have alcohol, it’s for the taste, not the effect. I am once again in control.’ VERDICT . Writer Chris Henry gave up sugar for three months . Jackie Lynch says: ‘The NHS is planning to offer women who drink five units of alcohol a day – that’s a couple of large glasses of wine – addiction medication to reduce the numbers of patients with an alcohol-related illness. Many middle-class professionals think drinking this much is pretty normal. It’s not. The advantages from reducing intake, besides reducing the risk of heart and liver disease, diabetes and stroke, is it will make a rapid difference to your shape – as Angella has discovered. She would have seen even more progress if she hadn’t drunk so much coconut water because a litre contains the equivalent of 12 teaspoons of sugar.’ Scott Laidler says: ‘Her already high levels of cholesterol have increased, and I’d suggest warrant medical investigation – perhaps she turned to comfort foods high in saturated fats, but there could be an underlying genetic cause. Even if she did need medication, her numbers could be lowered with the correct food choices in combination with regular exercise.’ I went sugar-free...and dropped two trouser sizes . Chris Henry, 42, is single and lives in Hove. He says: ‘How hard can it be to quit sugar? The answer is it’s incredibly difficult. Sugar is in everything, from the obvious cakes and biscuits to shop-bought soups. On the first day I left the shop with just asparagus and cheese. Midmorning and after dinner was when my sweet cravings were worse and I had to fight the urge for a bar of chocolate. I had headaches and felt lethargic – I just didn’t think sugar had that kind of power. ‘CBT helped me break the pattern of rewarding myself with sweet snacks, but the main motivator was mathematical – I learned to work out how much added sugar is in food and picture it as teaspoons. Going to the pub was fine – red wine is naturally low in sugar. But I avoided eating out as I couldn’t face opting for a salad. ‘Going sugar-free meant a more traditional meat-and-veg diet. I lost 7lb in ten days. At the end of the experiment I bought a cake and a Chinese takeaway, but didn’t touch either. My tastebuds have changed – even sliced bread is too sweet. I am almost two trouser sizes smaller and feel so much better.’ VERDICT . Antonia Hoyle gave up caffeine for the experiment . Jackie says:  ‘Chris has done himself huge favours as his waist was heading towards 35in, the size linked to development of diabetes. His blood pressure has improved dramatically – the body breaks down sugar and converts it into energy and this may increase the heart rate if consumption is excessive. ‘Sugars can build up in the liver, impairing function – so that’s why this reading improved. ‘The rise in cholesterol might be down to the cheese – he needs to ensure his diet is rich in soluble fibre which binds to and excretes cholesterol in the gut. He should also aim to increase essential fats from foods such as oily fish and nuts.’ Scott says: Sugar and white foods such as chips and buns are addictive. People use sweet treats to make themselves feel better emotionally. The fast-release energy they provide can’t all be utilised by a typically sedentary person with a desk job, so it’s stored as fat. Once you wean your tastebuds away from sweet things, it’s easy to break the bond. Hopefully the huge positives Chris has experienced will help keep him from relapsing.’ Quitting coffee left me calmer - but fatter . Antonia Hoyle, 36, lives in London with her husband Chris and two children. She says: ‘I knew I was a caffeine addict, drinking four coffees, three cups of tea and two cans of sugar-free cola a day to cope with the demands of being a working mother. But reading reports linking the drug – yes, it is – to anxiety rang so very true. I also suffered constant headaches. ‘The first week was hellish: I was light-headed, irritable and overcome by waves of tiredness. CBT sessions helped remind me that these side effects were normal. After that my headaches stopped and I slept better overnight. I felt less anxious and my moods were much more even. ‘But I felt flat. There was nothing to look forward to in the mornings. Decaf tea tasted like fish and herbal tea was unsatisfying. Instead of espressos I’d resort to the biscuit barrel or chocolate to perk me up. My evening cola was replaced with a couple of glasses of wine. My weight crept up as a result. Within a week of the experiment ending, I was back to two cups of tea and cup of coffee a day. I’ve decided caffeine is one drug that can be enjoyed in moderation.’ VERDICT . Jackie says: ‘Caffeine is a stimulant and Antonia was consuming to excess – 400mg a day is the upper recommended limit and she was downing more than twice this, which was exacerbating her anxiety. The drop in blood pressure is a result of her giving up. It’s typical that she substituted it with another stimulant: sugar. Rehab clinics ban sweets because drug addicts often gorge on sugary snacks when their primary vice is removed, and she’s lucky she didn’t put on even more weight. I suspect she isn’t eating a balanced diet with enough complex carbohydrates to sustain her energy levels.’ Scott says: ‘All that caffeine was being processed by the liver, which also regulates cholesterol levels. Now that the organ can focus on its primary job, her levels have fallen too. But I suspect she’ll slip back into her old ways if she doesn’t tackle the issues driving her problem.’","Angella Johnson, Chris Henry and Antonia Hoyle all took part in experiment .

"Snapped: Kevin Spacey broke off his performance in Clarence Darrow at the Old Vic in London to reprimand an audience member whose mobile started ringing . Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey halted his new play on the opening night to snap at an audience member whose mobile phone went off yelling 'if you don't answer that I will'. The House Of Cards actor stars in legal drama . Clarence Darrow to celebrate the end of his 10 years as artistic . director of The Old Vic theatre in London. The one-man show sees Darrow, pioneering lawyer of 19th century America, relive some of the experiences which established his reputation as a courtroom giant and civil rights hero. During a scene in which his character is on trial, defending himself, Spacey was addressing the audience with a passionate plea for his innocence, when a mobile phone began ringing in that section. The music got louder and louder as the guilty party tried to look innocent, until Spacey finally snapped, in character shouting: 'If you don’t answer that, I will!' He received a round of applause. Following the performance audience members took to Twitter to praise the star for how he handled the interruption. Nick Clark wrote: 'Mobile phone went off in Old Vic's . Clarence Darrow tonight. Without breaking character Kevin Spacey said: . ""Either you answer that or I will"".' Twitter user @jmbriscoe added: 'Good to know if you’re an idiot & let your phone ring during a show, the magnificent Kevin Spacey will call you out on it.' And Nick Bailey said: 'Kevin Spacey, in character, to ringing phone in audience: ""if you don't answer that I will"". Legend. #clarencedarrow.' Performing in the round, Spacey had the audience hanging on his every word as he moved between engaging chats and witty anecdotes, to emotional confessions and rousing speeches. The 54-year-old star’s commanding performance earned him a standing ovation last night. Spacey has played the character before, on stage in Inherit The Wind and 22 years ago in the PBS film Darrow. Praise: Audience members took to Twitter to praise the star for how he handled the interruption . Support: Nick Bailey said Spacey was a 'Legend' for the way he dealt with the phone ringing . Magnificent: Spacey did not even break character as he paused to tick off the audience member . He said: 'Clarence Darrow was a unique and courageous man. Several of my favourite actors have played Darrow... Henry Fonda, Orson Welles and Spencer Tracy. 'Wanting to get up on my beloved Old Vic stage in our 10th anniversary season was also important to me. And taking on a play that I feel very close to seems right. 'Finally, throw in that I’ve never done a one-man play, or performed in the round before, and this production offered me two firsts. Plus, you know I love a challenge.' The production is directed by Thea Sharrock, who made the Christmas special of Call The Midwife. Spacey, who has appeared in several Old Vic productions during his decade’s tenure, including Richard III and The Philadelphia Story, is stepping down as artistic director at the end of this year. He will be replaced by Matthew Warchus. Farewell performance: Kevin Spacey stars in legal drama Clarence Darrow to celebrate the end of his 10 years as artistic director of The Old Vic theatre in London (pictured) Kevin Spacey’s reprimanding of an audience member who left their phone switched on is not the first time a famous actor has taken a stand against noise interrupting their performance. Audience members are warned to turn their mobile phones off as a matter of course prior to the vast majority of theatre shows - but a ringing phone is not always to blame. Spacey himself attacked audience members . at the Old Vic in 2004 for letting their phones go off inside the . theatre and for noisily opening sweet wrappers. Royal row: Last May, Dame Helen Mirren shouted at a group of drummers to be quiet during her performance as the Queen in The Audience at the Gielgud Theatre . Ticking off: Dame Helen was still in her Queen costume when she told the drummers to be quiet . And last May, Dame Helen Mirren shouted at a group of drummers to be quiet while still dressed in her stage costume as Queen Elizabeth II. The troupe of dancing drummers, who were promoting a festival for gay and transgender people, were stunned when Dame Helen told them in colourful language to be quiet. She went outside the West End’s Gielgud Theatre - where she was starring as the Queen in The Audience, for which she has won an Olivier Award - in the interval to confront the group. The next day she arrived at the theatre wearing a T-shirt supporting them, and admitted using “a few thespian words” . She said the group were “very sweet and stopped the minute they knew I wasn’t just a batty old woman haranguing them on the streets of Soho”. Back in 2009, the showstopping performance by Hollywood stars Daniel Craig and Hugh Jackman as their Broadway show was interrupted by a mobile phone call became an internet hit. Footage of the stars as they . unflappably dealt with the continued ringing during a New York . performance of A Steady Rain was watched a third of a million times in a . matter of hours. The . footage - which itself seems to have been taken with a mobile - was . posted on YouTube, showing how they halt their usual dialogue until the . ringing stops. Interrupted: In 2009 the performance by Hollywood stars Daniel Craig and Hugh Jackman in A Steady Rain was interrupted by a mobile phone call . James Bond star Craig and Wolverine actor Jackman took the ringing phone in their stride as it interrupted a preview performance of the play. Jackman told the owner of the ringing phone “you want to get that?”, as the audience laughed and cheered. As the ringing continued, Jackman paced the stage and pleaded: “Come on, just turn it off.” Craig then joined in with the ad libs at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre, asking: “Can you get that, whoever that is, can you get it? We can wait, just get the phone.” “Don’t be embarrassed, just grab the phone,” Jackman urged. The pair had to wait about a minute for the ringing to stop. Richard Griffiths, who died in March last year, was famously short tempered when it came to noisy audience members. In November 2005 he halted a performance of Heroes at London's Wyndham's theatre and threw out one theatre-goer when her mobile phone went off for the third time, after asking 'Is that it or will it be ringing some more? 'Could the person whose mobile phone . it is please leave? The 750 people here would would be fully justified . in suing you for ruining their afternoon.' He was given a standing ovation by the audience. Griffiths, . whose film roles included Withnail & I and Harry Potter, also . reprimaded audience members whose phones went off during performances of . The History Boys at the National in London in 2004, and in New York in . 2006. Action: Richard Griffiths (left), pictured with Heroes co-stars John Hurt and Ken Stott, stopped the show to throw out an audience member when her phone went off for a third time . He told the Broadway audience: 'You should be ashamed of yourselves. 'I am not going to compete with these electronic devices. You were told to turn them off by the stage manager, you were told it was against the law.' He was said to have added: 'We're going to start this scene again. If we hear one more phone go off, we'll quit this afternoon's performance. You have been warned.' In 2012, famed director Sir Peter Hall apologised to Downton Abbey actress Laura Carmichael after he 'unintentionally disrupted' the star during her West End stage debut. The actress, who shot to fame as Downton’s Lady Edith Crawley, continued her closing monologue in the Chekhov classic Uncle Vanya, despite a commotion caused by Sir Peter. The theatre veteran, then 81, denied reports that he heckled the actress during the performance on Friday and said he was 'disorientated' after falling asleep. He said in a statement: 'I am mortified that I unintentionally disrupted the final scene of Uncle Vanya and I have sent a personal note to Laura Carmichael offering my apologies. 'I enjoyed the evening, and her performance, immensely, and I cannot stress too strongly that my remarks were in no way directed at her or the production.' Sir Peter, who founded the Royal Shakespeare Company and directed the National Theatre, said: 'Being rather aged, I dropped off for a moment and on being woken by my wife I was briefly disorientated. 'Remarks made in the resulting confusion were not in any way related to Uncle Vanya which I think is a very fine production with a marvellous company of actors.'","House Of Cards actor, 54, halted Clarence Darrow at the Old Vic in London .

"'Bailout': The nephew of JFK, Robert Kennedy Jr., received $1.4bn of taxpayers' cash for his company, it is claimed . The nephew of former president John F. Kennedy has been given a secret £1.4bn bailout for his company thanks to his White House connections, a new book has claimed. Robert F. Kennedy Jr is said to have received the vast sum of tax-payers' cash for his 'green energy' firm BrightSource while it was $1.8bn in debt in 2010. The payment was made by Sanjay Wagle, a former BrightSource  employee who after raising money for Barack Obama was rewarded with a job in the U.S. Department of Energy, it is claimed. The revelation was made in an explosive new book, Throw The All Out, which exposes the secret financial deals of an inner circle of businessmen and politicians in the White House. The author Peter Schweizer says that the payment was made to Kennedy Jr. thanks to connections in Washington. Kennedy Jr. is the son of Robert F. Kennedy and Ethel Skakel Kennedy. Robert 'Bobby' Kennedy is the brother of the former president JFK, who was assassinated in 1963. Following JFK's assasiantion in November 1963, Robert 'Bobby' Kennedy continued to serve as Attorney General under President Lyndon B. Johnson for nine months. However, he later split after disagreements over the Vietnam War and by 1968 was a favourite for the Democratic Party leadership. Tragically, just hours after winning the California presidential Bobby Kennedy was shot three times by Sirhan Sirhan by Arab gunman Sirhan Sirhan while addressing a packed hotel in L.A. He died 26 hours later on June 26. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has forged a successful career as an attorney specialising in environmental law and more recently and as a radio host, . Wagle was one of the principals in Kennedy’s firm who raised money for Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign. When Obama was elected to the White House in 2008, Wagle was installed at the Department of Energy (DOE), advising on energy grants. Family connections: Robert F. Kennedy Jr's father Robert 'Bobby' Kennedy, centre, with former president John F. Kennedy, left, and  Edward 'Ted' Kennedy, right . BrightSource, whose largest . shareholder is Kennedy’s VantagePoint Partners, is said to have faced . financial difficulties before the bailout. The company needed a massive government contract for a solar-panel plant on federal lands on California if it was to survive. A . company statement from the time said: 'Our future success depends on . our ability to construct Ivanpah, our first utility-scale solar thermal . power project, in a cost-effective and timely manner. 'Our ability to complete Ivanpah and the planning, development and construction of all three phases are subject to significant risk and uncertainty.' The company was able to continue with the project after the bailout, it is alleged. Just two years previously, Kenndery Jr. had said publicly that Obama's energy plans would create 'a gold rush'. Claims: Throw Them All Out by investigative journalist Peter Schweizer . Schweizer writes in Throw Them All Out: 'A billion dollars in taxpayer money being sent to wealthy investors to bail them out of risky investments—does this sound familiar to anyone?' It is also claimed in the book that billionaire investor Warren Buffet profited with millions from the government bailout programs he helped design. However, all of transactions are legal in the U.S. The book merely highlights how 'insiders' can profit from the system. Schweizer also claims that Nancy Pelosi, Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives, bought VISA shares while she was overseeing legislation that would directly impact the stock’s value. Schweizer writes in the book: 'Politicians have made politics a business. They are increasingly entrepreneurs who use their power, access, and privileged information to generate wealth. 'And at the same time well-connected financiers and corporate leaders have made a business of politics. They meet together in the nation’s capital to form a political caste. 'In short, the Permanent Political Class has clearly figured out how to extract wealth from the rest of us based solely on their position and proximity to power. If you have a seat at the table, you are in for a feast. 'If you don’t have a seat at the table, you are probably on the menu. Exactly how crony capitalists are consuming public wealth and fattening themselves is the subject of this book.' He said that Palosi had profited from a street lighting project which she was in charge of. He added: 'For years, Nancy Pelosi has pushed for earmarks to construct and ultimately extend San Francisco’s so-called Third Street Light Rail Project. 'In 2004, she boasted to her constituents that she had secured more than $120 million in federal money for the project. Third Street is one of the most expensive light rail projects ever, costing $660 million for just a six-mile route.

"Until now, the whereabouts of a Lancaster bomber shot down in 1943 remained a mystery. Gunner John Currey (pictured) was one of seven crewmen who died after the Berlin raid . As the Lancaster raced across the night sky in 1943 after completing its 19th bombing raid, the crew's luck finally ran out. It was shot down by a Luftwaffe air ace as it returned from Berlin - and for 70 years, the whereabouts of the plane and its brave airmen, including Sgt John Currey, remained a mystery. But now, John's two sisters have finally learned the truth about the World War Two hero after his bomber was discovered in a remote German forest. Nora Williams, 89, and her sister Molly, 87, were teenagers when their brother failed to come home. The 21-year-old air gunner, of Scarborough, North Yorkshire, was part of a seven-man crew who flew in the Lancaster ED328. None of the crew survived the fateful flight and their families never knew where and how they died. But aviation historians have now discovered the wreckage of the downed Lancaster bomber 70 years after the tragedy - in dense woodland 25 miles north of Berlin. And Nora, who still lives in Scarborough, told of her relief yesterday after finally discovering what happened to her lost brother. She said: 'I have always wanted to know what really happened to my brother and now I have got that. 'I was surprised to get this information - it came completely out of the blue - but it has been quite satisfying. 'There is only myself and Molly left from the family and we are still coming to terms with it. It’s difficult to talk about.' Pictured are four of the other Bomber Command crew (l to r) who took part in the bombing raid of Berlin that night: Sgt John Phillips, Flight Sgt Douglas Tresidder, Flight Sgt Robert Naffin and Sgt David Morgan Ellis . John Currey's two sisters - Nora and Molly Williams - have finally learned the truth about their war hero brother after his plane was discovered in a remote German forest. Aviation historians have established it came down in woodland in the village of Lanke, 25 miles north of Berlin . The discovery of the crash site was made by aircrew family member Ian Hill - the nephew of Sgt John Phillips, who was the 19-year-old mid-upper gunner. His family is pictured with Dr Hans Richter, who witnessed the crash when he was 14 . The discovery of the crash site was made by aircrew family member Ian Hill - the nephew of Sgt John Phillips, who was the 19-year-old mid-upper gunner. Mr Hill said his 81-year-old mother Alwyn had finally been given 'closure' after learning what happened to her brother. He said: 'We managed to track down an eyewitness who saw the whole night battle above his head and then the crash. 'The Lancaster was attacked from underneath and its fuel tanks were hit - causing it to explode in mid-air. Pictured are the remains from the Lancaster crash site, now in an aviation museum in Berlin . Above, a Lancaster bomber similar to the one which came down outside Berlin. Nora, who lives in Scarborough, told of her relief yesterday after finally discovering what happened to her lost brother . The Lancaster got lost as it tried to return to the 101 Squadron base in Ludford Magna, Lincolnshire, after the raid. The RAF crash report during the war couldn't pinpoint where the plane came down . The young crew were intercepted and shot down by the Messerschmitt of Major Werner Husemann (above), who is still alive aged 94 . 'We now know that the bodies of the crew were treated with the utmost respect by the Luftwaffe and buried with full military honours in a local cemetery.' The seven-man crew was made up of three British airmen of the RAFVR and four Australian members of the RAAF. Their plane was lost trying to return to the 101 Squadron base in Ludford Magna, Lincolnshire, after the raid over Berlin. The RAF crash report during the war couldn’t pinpoint where the Lancaster came down. But after months of poring over incorrect crash reports, Mr Hill and a team of German aviation archaeologists finally discovered they came down in woodland near the village of Lanke. They were flying their 19th Bomber Command mission when their luck ran out. By 1943, Bomber Command aircrews had just a one in four chance of surviving their first 30 missions. The young crew were returning from the raid when they were intercepted by the Messerschmitt of Major Werner Husemann - who is still alive aged 94. He was a highly decorated air ace who received The Iron Cross from Adolf Hitler. Sales manager Mr Hill, from Crewe, Cheshire, said the schoolboy who witnessed the final moments of the crew gave him an emotional tour around the forest crash site. The bodies of the crew were treated with the utmost respect by the Luftwaffe and buried with full military honours in a local cemetery . Mr Hill said: 'Dr Hans Richter was only 14 at the time but his memory is so vivid. It was an extremely traumatic experience as it took place over his head. 'He said he saw a chain of light going from the German night fighter to a large black four-engined plane. 'Next there were sparks and a huge red fireball and then the plane came down in parts after exploding. 'His father was the head of the local fire brigade which had to tend to the crash site and exhumed the bodies. 'It was wonderful to learn they were laid out in the village hall and buried in the local cemetery with full military honours by the Luftwaffe and treated with respect.' The search is still underway to trace the remaining families of the tragic crew who have never known where and how their loved ones died. Above, a whistle recovered from the crash site . In 1946, the bodies of the crew were moved and interred at the Berlin 1939-45 war cemetery. Now parts of the crashed plane have gone on display at Finowfurt Aviation Museum in Berlin. The search is still underway to trace the remaining families of the tragic crew who have never known where and how their loved ones died. They include the family of married 32-year-old flight engineer Flt Sgt David Morgan Ellis, of Pontypridd, South Wales. The two remaining Australian crew to have families traced are 23-year-old air gunner Flt Sgt Everard John Phillips, of Wembley, Western Australia, and 25-year-old navigator Flt Sgt Noel Joseph Bullen, of Thornbury, Victoria. Mr Hill said: 'Before this discovery, all the families knew was they had crashed somewhere around Berlin and were buried in the Berlin war cemetery in 1946. 'It would be really nice to try and share the whole experience with the other families and give them what we have had - the chance to go and see the plane and crash site. 'At the end of the day, these guys gave their lives for the freedoms we have today. 'It’s nice to be able to pay some respects and keep their memory alive.'

"Dean Farrimond killed two people by crashing into their taxi while driving his own car high on drugs and alcohol . A drunk motorist killed a taxi driver and his passenger in a head on crash while 'fishtailing' across the road having binged on cocaine and lager. Dean Farrimond was driving on the wrong side of the road when he lost control of his car and smashed into the oncoming taxi. Driver Kenneth Grimshaw, 59 and passenger Emma Houghton, 23, died after the vehicle was thrown backwards into a house in Leigh, Greater Manchester. Tests taken after the fatal collision showed Farrimond, a father-of-three, was more than twice the legal alcohol limit when he got behind the wheel. The 35-year-old was jailed for eight years today after telling police he did not remember the incident on November 30, 2013. Liverpool Crown Court heard Mr Grimshaw was a driving instructor by day, and had taken up work with a private taxi company when he collected Miss Houghton, a mother-of-two. Farrimond had been drinking and taking drugs including diazepam and cocaine at a nearby social club when decided to drive home. At around 4am, witnesses described his 'out of control' driving. He had travelled around one kilometre when his car veered into the path of Mr Grimshaw and Miss Houghton. The taxi driver died at the scene while Miss Houghton was taken to hospital. She later died of head injuries. Judge Clement Goldstone QC told Farrimond he did not believe that he could not remember the horrendous crash. 'You knew perfectly well what had happened but you were not able or willing to accept responsibility for the enormity of what you had done. 'It was an appalling piece of driving and that cocktail of three components but principally alcohol, was to prove a lethal one,' he said. Farrimond was banned from driving for ten years. Miss Houghton's father, Stuart Foy, described his daughter as a 'fun and bubbly' woman who 'loved life'. 'Emma was a young girl that loved life. Now she has been taken from us, her children will never grow up to know their mother.' Mr Grimshaw's daughters paid tribute to their 'hard-working' and 'selfless' father. Emma Houghton (left) and taxi driver Kenneth Grimshaw (right) were killed in the accident last November . A judge at Liverpool Crown Court rejected Farrimond's claim he could not remember the events of the crash . Sgt Mark Thomas from the Serious Collision Investigation Unit said: 'Due to Farrimond’s irresponsible and reckless actions, two families have been left truly devastated. 'Emma was a young woman who was just starting out in life and Ken was a loving family man who had two daughters and three grandchildren. 'Both families have been left with huge voids in their lives that will never be filled but hopefully, this sentencing can help a little with closure.'","Dean Farrimond had been drinking at local social club when he drove home .

"Anne Frank was posthumously baptised by a Mormon for the first time in 13 years after nine similar rituals were allegedly carried out in the 1990s. The Jewish girl and her diary rose to fame after she died during the World War Two Holocaust in 1945 at the Bergen-Belsen camp in Germany. But a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints member has caused fury by baptising her by proxy at a Dominican Republic temple last weekend. Jewish girl: Anne Frank and her diary rose to fame after she died during the World War Two Holocaust in 1945 at the Bergen-Belsen camp in Germany . Researcher Helen Radkey made the discovery after she found the same was done to the parents of Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal two weeks ago. Ex-Mormon Ms Radkey found Annelies Marie ‘Anne’ Frank was baptised on Saturday, in a move that will leave the Jewish community furious again. An agreement from 1995 required Mormons to avoid submitting names of Holocaust victims for baptism unless they are their direct ancestors. But Anne, who died aged 15, was baptised by proxy an astonishing nine times between 1989 and 1999, Ms Radkey told the Huffington Post. Records: The former Mormon found Annelies Marie 'Anne' Frank was baptised on Saturday, in a move that will leave the Jewish community furious . The Mormon Church is coming under more scrutiny thanks to Broadway show The Book of Mormon and Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign. 'The security of the names submissions process for posthumous rites must be questioned' Helen Radkey . It often holds the baptisms, saying people who died that did not get the chance to be baptised while living can choose to deny it. Anne’s name was found in a genealogy database where names can be put forward for baptism - only accessible by Mormons. A Mormon spokesman confirmed what happened and said the person who submitted the baptism has had their access to records suspended. Family life: Anne Frank, right, and her father Otto Frank, left, are seen in Amsterdam, Netherlands, in July 1941. Others in the photo are unidentified . ‘The security of the names submissions . process for posthumous rites must be questioned,’ a fuming Ms Radkey . told the Huffington Post. During the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, Anne Frank spent 25 months in hiding with seven others . Her diary of their ordeal, before a raid in August 1944, is a famous and enduring Holocaust account . She died of typhus in March 1945 . She said this latest find was even more outrageous because Anne, famous for her work entitled ‘The Diary of a Young Girl’, left no descendants. But a spokesman for the Mormon Church . said it was ‘distressed’ by the finding and ‘keeps its word’ in not . baptising Holocaust victims. ‘It takes a good deal of deception . and manipulation to get an improper submission through the safeguards we've put in place,’ the Mormon spokesman told the Salt Lake Tribune. Interest: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has been under heavier scrutiny since Mormon presidential candidate Mitt Romney began his campaign . Two weeks ago the Simon Wiesenthal . Center was left ‘outraged’ by the posthumous baptism of the long-dead . couple Asher and Rosa Wiesenthal. The Mormon Church often carries out posthumous baptisms and says those who . have died can deny it . They say it's done as many dead people did not have the chance to be baptised while on earth . It's a huge issue in the . Jewish community because many in the past have been forced to . convert to Christianity or murdered if not . Rosa Wiesenthal died at the Nazi death . camp at Belzec, Poland, in 1942, but Asher was killed years before in . action as an Austrian soldier in 1915. Mormon officials apologised for that incident and said the actions by an ‘individual member’ were . ‘against the policy of the Church’. Mr Wiesenthal died in 2005 aged 96 and was a top Jewish rights advocate in his life after surviving several concentration camps.

"Mr Rowe has been advocating for the AFL to be broadcast in HD for two years . An avid AFL fan has accused the Seven Network of 'backflipping' on a promise to broadcast the 2014 grand final on it's high definition channel. Josh Rowe, a passionate AFL follower, has been advocating for the broadcast of AFL in HD for over two years, with his webite 'AFL in HD Please' having nearly 80,000 followers on Twitter. Rowe went public with emails on Tuesday which detail communication between himself and Seven Melbourne managing director Lewis Martin, which indicate that the network made a commitment to show the AFL grand final on their HD broadcast channel, 7Mate. 'I thought we had achieved something,' said Rowe. 'He didn't have to make that promise, but he did and he broke it. He wanted the whole campaign to be shut down by making a promise, and now he has to feel the consequences of doing that.' In March this year, Rowe had a phone conference with Seven Melbourne's  Lewis Martin regarding the commercial realities of broadcasting in HD, during which Martin made a verbal commitment to broadcast the grand final in HD. 'We had a very open conversation,' Rowe told Daily Mail Australia, 'during which he told me that the grand final would be in HD. I was delighted.' AFL fans will not be watching the Sydney Swans (pictured) play Hawthorn in high definition on Saturday . Mr Rowe's email to Seven Melbourne managing director Lewis Martin asking for an explanation . Mr Lewis insisted he never made such a promise . Free-to-air channels have been beset by requests from sports fans to broadcast games in HD, an ongoing issue for many enthusiasts in Australia. Many major sporting codes are not broadcast in the higher definition resolution, with the Seven, Nine and Ten networks only broadcasting in standard definition. 'I followed up the meeting with an email, asking for permission to announce the good news. Lewis replied back and asked if I would keep it confidential,' said Rowe, 'and I agreed.' In the email dated March 31st from Martin to Rowe, the managing director of Seven Melbourne asks, 're GF (grand final) this year that needs to remain confidential'. 'We have been emailing back and forth frequently since March and at no point did he say that the grand final would be in standard definition. I emailed him a few weeks ago and he told me to hold the fort, and it wasn't until I saw the TV guide published that I realised the Seven Network hadn't scheduled the grand final in HD.' After learning that the Seven Network did not intend to broadcast the grand final this Saturday between the Hawthorn Hawks and Sydney Swans in HD, Rowe confronted Martin. 'I called him and asked if it was a mistake. He said it wasn't, and then denied ever making the promise to me,' said Rowe. 'I did not promise that. I said to you I would update you in the event we would be. I shared with you the commercial realities,' wrote Martin in an email provided to Daily Mail Australia, which Rowe has labelled as a 'gold medal winning back flip'. 'I said that I was going to publish the emails on my blog,' said Rowe. ''I kept my promise for this whole year, and if anything, dampened slightly the efforts of the HD campaign because of what I knew.' The 80,000-strong social media following had gathered strength earlier in the year, in addition to a petition for the grand final to be broadcast in HD . The some 80,000-strong social media following had gathered strength earlier in the year, in addition to a petition for the grand final to be broadcast in HD. 'The campaign was pushing for change,' said Rowe, 'Not just for myself but for all the fans out there. To have that all fall away is so disappointing, and I think people need to know what Channel 7 is doing.' 'They have chosen to air B-grade shows which garner only a small viewer base simply for the profit margin. Instead of broadcasting the grand final which is one of the biggest sporting events of the year, they have let down fans and chosen money.' Airing on 7Mate at the time of the grand final on Saturday are episodes of Swamp Men, motoring programs, Pimp My Ride and a collectible show called Bid America. Rowe is now campaigning for awareness, calling for a boycott of sponsors of the AFL and deliberately spreading information about HD options. The Seven Network has declined to comment, issuing a statement that the grand final is available in standard definition, returning to the base line which Rowe is so passionate about improving.","Was promised by Seven Melbourne that the AFL grand final would be broadcast in high definition .

"Labour's flagship immigration policy to force firms to take on British apprentices unravelled within hours today, as it emerged the jobs will be open to anyone from within the EU. To much fanfare Ed Miliband unveiled the plan to compel large firms who bring in skilled foreign workers to also 'train up someone who is a local worker'. Despite efforts to woo business leaders to back Labour's reforms, industry groups lined up to slam the 'apprentice tax' which they warned would create a raft of 'daft' new red-tape at a time when firms were struggling to stay afloat. Top team: Labour leader Ed Miliband (right) chats with shadow chancellor Ed Balls and shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Rachel Reeves backstage, during the first day of Labour's annual party conference in Brighton . Mr Miliband said he wanted to reduce low-skill immigration and insisted the party was committed to introducing an immigration bill in its first year of office. He said Labour would force firms to train a British apprentice for every non-EU overseas worker they bring to the UK to help create a 'high wage economy' and ease the cost of living 'crisis'. 'Any firm that wants to bring in a foreign worker from outside the EU will also have to train up someone who is a localworker,' Mr Miliband told the Sunday Mirror. But it emerged that under EU law it is illegal to block other Europeans from apply for jobs, including apprenticeships, in the UK. With youth unemployment running at 50 per cent in Spain and millions out of work across the continent, a two-year placement with high-skilled British employers would be an attractive prospect for many from overseas. Tory skills minister Matthew Hancock said: 'I have been advised by Government lawyers that legislating to require hiring British apprentices would be contrary to EU law.' Tory Education Secretary Michael Gove said: 'This policy was meant to be the centrepiece of Ed Miliband's conference - and it's turned into a shambles. 'If he can't get this right - how can he ever be trusted to run the country?' Labour sources stressed that the vast majority of apprentices in Britain are British, with most taking up posts near to where they live. Pledge: Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna said firms should hire British apprenticeships as well as foreign workers . Under the Labour plan all firms with more than 50 employees will have to train an apprentice for every worker they hire from outside the European Union. It is claimed it could create up to 125,000 apprenticeships over five years. Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said it was proof Labour have learnt from their mistakes on immigration. A new Ipsos Mori poll shows only 19 per cent of voters think Labour has the right policies on asylum and immigration. Mr Umunna admitted that while in government Labour were sometimes worried that dealing with immigration involved issues of race. He said it was important that companies train British people in the skills firms need. Mr Umunna added: ‘I think we acknowledge that we didn't get everything right in government in respect of immigration. ‘To start with we were too afraid of talking about it because sometimes people were worried that that involved issues of race. ‘But I don't think it is racist to worry about how immigration impacts on our economy and the opportunities for our young people and what you've seen today is the Labour Party showing that we've listened, we've learned from some of our mistakes and we're determined to ensure that we've got an economy that works for working families.’ But the policy has raised fears of a short-term skills back if firms are discouraged from taking on high-skilled foreign workers. John Longworth, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: 'This is an ""apprentice tax"" on employers and job creation. 'It serves neither to control immigration, where we should have a points system linked more strongly to economic benefit, nor young people, who should be encouraged and properly supported rather than being used to control immigration by other means.' Simon Walker, Director General of the Institute of Directors, said: 'Several of Labour's proposals are completely removed from reality and betray the fact that their authors can have had no experience of running a business. 'Compelling companies to take on an apprentice for every non EU employee is a daft policy which would damage many small and medium sized businesses just as they are starting to grow.'

Mr Miliband arrived in Brighton with the party's poll lead dwindling and internal critics warning he has failed to set out a clear strategy for the 2015 general election. A total of 38 per cent of voters say the Tories have the right policies on the economy, almost double the 20 per cent who back Labour. Mr Miliband’s party has also been rocked by the reopening of old wounds with the publication of disgraced Gordon Brown spin doctor Damian McBride's insider account of vicious party in-fighting.","All companies with more than 50 staff would be hit by new rule .

"The life sentence handed down to the schoolboy who murdered a teacher was today condemned as too harsh by youth justice campaigners. William Cornick, 16, will serve at least 20 years for killing Ann Maguire, 61, who was stabbed seven times from behind as she taught a Spanish class at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds in April. Mr Justice Coulson warned Cornick, who was 15 at the time, that he might never be released from prison - and her widower, Don, described the killing as a ‘monumental act of cowardice and evil’. Scroll down for video . Too harsh: Penelope Gibbs (left), the chairman of the Standing Committee for Youth Justice umbrella group of charities and campaign groups, said the sentence given to murderer William Cornick (right) was too long . But former magistrate Penelope Gibbs, the chairman of  the Standing Committee for Youth Justice (SCYJ) umbrella group of charities and campaign groups, said the sentence was too long. She told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: ‘We are out of line with the whole of western Europe. ‘There are no other countries within Western Europe which give children - and this boy is seen as a child under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and is in the youth justice system - who would give children a life sentence.’ Her comments were criticised as ‘stupid’ on Twitter today. Mrs Gibbs accepted that the sentence had to serve as a punishment, but said there was ‘no evidence’ for the 20-year minimum tariff. ‘Punishment is also incredibly important, particularly for the victims and families, but the fact is, how many years do we need for punishment? We have given him a sentence which is more than his own lifetime,’ she said. ‘He was 15 when he did this crime and we would say that you don't need that long to punish. Listen to the full  Radio 4 show here. Murder case: Cornick (right, in court) will serve at least 20 years for killing Ann Maguire (left) who was stabbed seven times from behind as she taught a Spanish class at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds in April . ‘What is crucial is that when he is released he is assessed as no longer being of danger to himself and others and thus we would all be safer. 'But there is no evidence that that takes 20 years and we've looked and we think that this is the longest sentence given to a child in at least 10 years. ‘I'm not going to tell you exactly what the right sentence would have been, but 20 years and a life sentence is too long.’ She continued: ‘There are very good prisons, there is a prison called Grendon [in Buckinghamshire] which is a therapeutic community, and prisoners go there for a few years and it has great results. ‘The question is - safer society, yes; punishment, yes - but does it need to be more than his lifetime?’ Rose Dixon, chief executive of Birmingham-based charity Support After Murder and Manslaughter, said that members of her organisation would ‘not be impressed' with Mrs Gibbs's comments. She told MailOnline: ‘People need to be aware that for many families the trauma of being bereaved in this horrific and traumatic way will never leave them and their lives can never be the same again. Victim's family: (From left) Mrs Maguire's daughters Emma Maguire and Kerry Maguire and widower Don Maguire at Leeds Crown Court following the sentencing of 16-year-old William Cornick for the teacher's murder . ‘With specialist support they can rebuild a life - but not the life they had before the brutal killing of their loved one. ‘Every birthday, anniversary and Christmas for the rest of their lives their loved one will be missed and the pain goes on for many, many years. ‘According to reports I believe this young man has said he “couldn't give a s***” about the impact on her family. Please will organisations or people who want to comment on cases like this think of the bereaved family involved.’ Mrs Dixon added that if and when Cornick is released, he will probably have to be given a new identity - something which currently costs ‘in the region of £250,000 per person’. And Adam Pemberton, assistant chief executive of the charity Victim Support said: ‘Sentencing is a matter for the court judge who has heard all the facts of the case, and is carried out in accordance with Sentencing Council guidelines. ‘We believe it is essential when passing sentence that judges and magistrates also consider the impact on the victim or the victim’s family, not just the nature of the offence. ‘Victims, the bereaved and the public need to understand the reasons why a particular sentence has been handed down, and therefore good communication is key. ‘To maintain public confidence in the criminal justice system it is vital that offenders are appropriately punished, that serious and violent crimes are dealt with robustly and that offenders are properly rehabilitated so they don’t go on to commit more crime.’ Stephen Pollard, editor of the Jewish Chronicle, said on Twitter: 'Someone bleating on BBC Radio 4 Today that Ann Maguire's killer 20 year “minimum” sentence too long. How about having someone say it's too short?' Author Wilhemina Bothwell added: 'Who was that woman making stupid, stupid comments about 20-year sentence being too long for school room killer? Tell her about psychopaths.' And company director Russell Turner said: 'I'm sure she would be saying the sentence was too long if it was her mother that had been murdered.' But University of Southampton academic Mark Telford told Mrs Gibbs on Twitter: 'Good to hear you make those important points about capacity for change on BBC Radio 4 Today this morning.' Oxford-educated Mrs Gibbs, 50, who lives in a £1.7million four-bedroom semi-detached house in Kentish Town, north-west London, has been working in prison and justice reform since 2007. Prior to her work for the likes of the Prison Reform Trust, SCYJ and another charity called Transform Justice, Mrs Gibbs, who is married to David, 51, was an account manager for a marketing firm and a radio producer. Part of Cornick's rehabilitation could see him return to a classroom during his sentence. Brian Hamilton, chair of the Manchester College: University and College Union prison branch, said Cornick could be taught in a class of around eight people with a focus on basic literacy and numeracy skills and vocational training to ensure prisoners are employable on their release. Crime scene: Cornick killed Mrs Maguire in this classroom at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds in April . Cornick, who took and passed five GCSEs a year early, would be unlikely to be able to study for higher level qualifications. Mr Hamilton, who teaches in prisons, said: ‘I believe this young man is quite intelligent. He would probably be above the level they are trying to take them to in that establishment.’ He added: ‘It used to be that there was funding for them to do higher level courses but because of the cuts it's more difficult for people of a higher ability to continue their education.’ Mr Hamilton said Cornick would be treated the same as any other offender. He said: ‘They will do a risk assessment on anybody but, unless they're an immediate risk and deemed too dangerous to be in the class, he would be treated in exactly the same way as everybody else.’ Cornick attacked Mrs Maguire after boasting to friends that he was going to kill her. He also said he was going to murder other teachers, including a pregnant woman ‘so as to kill her unborn child’. The court heard that he later told doctors: ‘I said I was going to do other stuff but I never got the chance, other murders. It was a triple homicide.’ After the murder the teenager told psychiatrists that he ‘couldn't give a s***’ and added: ‘Everything I've done is fine and dandy.’","William Cornick to serve at least 20 years for killing Ann Maguire in Leeds .

"Eight members of a drugs gang who plotted to flood Tyneside with £200,000 worth of cocaine were jailed for almost 25 years. Lee Cheetham, used a network of his friends to transport and divide up the drugs. The 35-year-old criminal, from Walker, Newcastle, planned to use a cutting agent benzocaine and a hydraulic press to reduce the purity of the cocaine and increase his profits. Ringleader Lee Cheetham, left,  was jailed for nine years over his part in the cocaine plot, his lieutenant Anthony Hardy, right, received a four-year jail term after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply cocaine . Michael Duncan, left,  was described at Newcastle Crown Court as Hardy's accomplice and was seen entering the 'bash house', while 40-year-old   Paul Nichol, right was responsible for arranging the cocaine . Cheethan organised a 'bash house' in the Wallsend area of Newcastle where two members of the gang would use the cutting agent and the hydraulic press to prepare the cocaine for sale. Newcastle Crown Court heard that detectives had been keeping the 'bash house' on Hopper Street under surveillance. Telephone records revealed that the gang were preparing to 'bash' the drugs on May 12, 2013. The court heard that Dene Long obtained the benzocaine, which was being stored in the home of Cheetham's sister Karen. Paul Nichol was in charge of securing the cocaine as well the hydraulic press, which was being stored at Cheetham's business, LTC Tyres in Byker. Shaun McCumiskey handed the keys to the Hopper Street bash house to Anthony Hardy and Michael Duncan. Hardy was described in court as Cheetham's lieutenant while Duncan was Hardy's accomplice. Hardy and Duncan collected hydraulic press from the tyre centre. Police later observed Hardy at Karen Cheetham's house before he met with Nichol. The gang used a hydraulic press to mix the drugs, left, and squeeze them into cylindrical tablets, right . Once all the equipment and drugs were in place, Duncan and Hardy went into the bash house while their driver Lee Gourley kept a lookout outside. When Duncan and Hardy left the house and entered Gourley's car, police pounced. Gourley tried to flee but a police officer drove into the side of the car. Paul Mitchell, prosecuting, said police found 85g of cocaine in the car, a key to the house, two carrier bags of rubbish, which included latex gloves, two discs from an hydraulic press and a knotted bag of white powder. The drugs had a value of around £21,000 but, if the purity was reduced, they could have had a street value of up to £190,000. Sentencing the ring, Judge Brian Forster said: 'This was clearly set up as a business and that business had one intention. 'Anyone involved in the business of supplying class A drugs must expect a substantial sentence. 'Lee Cheetham, it was clear that this was your business and there may have been others up the chain. 'From the evidence I have seen you were actively involved in running what was taking place.' Lee Gourley, left, was sitting as a lookout outside the bash house where the cocaine was due to be mixed with the cutting agent benzocaine, which, Newcastle Crown Court heard,  was supplied by Dene Long, right . Chief Inspector Paul Knox, said: 'While investigating the gang we quickly identified that Lee Cheetham was the ringleader of the whole operation. He was the one making the plans and instructing the others on how they would run their illegal business. 'Cheetham is a calculated and dangerous man and it's reassuring to know that he will now spend the next nine years behind bars for what he has done. 'The others were involved to varying degrees; Hardy, Duncan, Nichol, and Gourley were all involved in dealing the drugs and moving them around Tyneside. 'Long got the gang the chemicals needed to cut their drugs, McCumiskey allowed them to use the property in Hopper Street, that belonged to his family, as the base for their drugs operation. And Cheetham even got his sister involved by getting her to agree to them using her house as a storage area for chemicals and drug making equipment. 'I hope this serves as a warning to those involved in the illegal selling and dealing of drugs in our area that we take this type of crime extremely seriously. 'We are always looking to target and take action against those looking to profit from the selling of drugs and we will continue to run operations like this to get you off our streets and out of our communities.' Karen Cheetham, left, stored the drugs and chemicals at her home while Shaun McCumiskey, right, allowed the gang to use a house owned in Wallsend by his family to cut the drugs and prepare them for distribution . Cheetham and Hardy, 28, of Walker Newcastle both pleaded guilty of conspiracy to supply cocaine and were jailed for nine and four years respectively. Duncan, 24, Walker, was sentenced to three years and four months after also pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply cocaine. Nichol, 40, of Elswick, was found guilty of conspiracy to supply cocaine after trial and was given four years. Gourley, 38, of Walker, was handed 32 months after being concerned in the supply of a class A drug. Long, 20, of Walker, pleaded guilty to being concerned in the supply of a class A drug and was given 12 months suspended for 18 months, and must complete 100 hours unpaid work. Karen Cheetham, 37, from Heaton, was given a nine months in prison suspended for two years and 150 hours unpaid work after pleading guilty to assisting an offender. McCumiskey, 34, of Wallsend, pleaded guilty to encouraging or assisting an offence and was handed 22 months in custody suspended for two years. Christopher Knox, for Cheetham, said he wasn't a man living the high-life, while saying Nichol hadn't been in trouble for 15 years. Tony Davis, for Hardy, said he felt great shame in becoming involved in the operation. Shaun Routledge, for Duncan, said he had no real understanding of the scale of the plot and said Gourley played a lesser role in the operation. Katherine Dunn, for Long, said his involvement was due to his naivety and stupidity.","Eight members of a drugs gang planned to flood Newcastle with cocaine .

"An elderly father was knocked down and killed on the steps of his local Royal British Legion club after a driving mistake by his own daughter, an inquest heard. Christine Kershaw, 63 dropped her father Ernest Kershaw, 86, off at the Farnborough, Hampshire club where he was a regular. But after handing her father his walking sticks Miss Kershaw, accidentally put her automatic car into forward instead of reverse gear, and the Kia Sedona people carrier hit Mr Kershaw, propelling him down the steps and into a handrail - he was pronounced dead at the scene. The Royal British Legion club in Farnborough, Hampshire where Mr Kershaw was an afternoon regular . Miss Kershaw, who wiped away tears as she gave evidence at the inquest, said: 'As I got in I realised I had left it in gear. I turned the ignition on and it started to move and hit the top of the steps. 'I was just trying to get the car away from him' The inquest heard how Miss Kershaw had been taking her father to the club every Sunday for around two years. He would arrive at 1pm and would mix with other club members, drinking a shandy and a whisky before being picked up at 3pm. There are two elements to unintentional acceleration syndrome which are acknowledged by psycho-analysts. The first is where the driver makes and error with the foot position of their vehicle. The second is where, as the vehicle accelerates, the driver's initial reaction is to press harder on what they think is the brake. Miss Kershaw added: 'I pulled up (to the steps). I needed to get his sticks for him. 'I jumped out, passed him his sticks, took him to the top of the stairs and took one stick off him because he couldn't manage two with the handrail. 'I went back to the car because I had to move it.' Club member Mathew Walker, who was having a cigarette in the smoking area a few feet away from the incident, also gave evidence at the inquest. He said: 'I heard what sounded like tyres screeching behind me. 'I turned around to face up the steps and saw a blue car coming down the steps. 'Ernie was on my right hand side. The car came down and veered slightly to my right and struck Ernie. 'It was very close and I didn't know which way it was going to go and I had to decide which way to jump. 'I jumped to my left and then the car struck the front of the club.' After the accident the engine was still being revved, and the inquest heard how a club member had to shout to shocked Miss Kershaw to turn the engine off. Forensic collision investigator Kevin Spiller was called to the scene and also gave evidence at the inquest. In a 'momentary lapse' Miss Kershaw put her Kia Sedona (like the one pictured) into reverse, then panicked and accelerated into her elderly father . He said: 'Unintentional acceleration syndrome, sometimes referred to as spontaneous acceleration syndrome, is an unexpected, inadvertent acceleration - the unintentional pressing of the accelerator instead of the brake or gear.' At the close of the hearing coroner Mr Bradley recorded a verdict that Mr Kershaw's death was accidental. He said: 'Let me first express my sympathy. 'It is a terrible situation to find yourself in and clearly one that was not intended at all. 'But it takes just a momentary lapse, that slightest confusion and things happen. 'It is a second's confusion when you believe you have done one thing when in fact you have done another. 'It is one of those things, but what a consequence. It is very difficult and I'm sure it is very painful.'","Daughter affected by unintentional acceleration syndrome inquest hears .

"The best friend of Australian triathlon legend Jackie Fairweather has revealed how the former world champion grappled with devastating depression, before the 46-year-old tragically took her own life. Hannah Walmsley described Ms Fairweather, a Commonwealth Games bronze medallist, as enduring a 'a tough journey', as the Australian sporting community struggles to come to terms with the tragedy. Ms Walmsley told the Canberra Times: 'It was a tough journey as well as a beautiful one. 'She had a really tough battle with herself, she fought so hard.' An overwhelming number of touching tributes are flowing in for legendary triathlete Jackie Fairweather who tragically died at the age of 46 . Ms Walmsley, who would have met Ms Fairweather for a 10km run early this morning, instead met her best friend's husband Simon yesterday. The pair consoled each other throughout what became a tribute jog. 'It was a beautiful way to remember our best friend,' Ms Walmsley said. Fairweather, or Gallagher, as she was known at the time - was considered a trailblazer for triathlons back in the 1990's when she excelled to the top of her game in the international arena. Gallagher proved to be a natural when she began competing in triathlons in 1992 and won the elite Australian National Series in her first season. During her eight years as a professional athlete - a career highlight was in 1996 when she was crowned the world triathlon champion - setting a championship record time of 1 hour 50 minutes, 52 seconds in Cleveland, Ohio. Fairweather was crowned World Triathlon champion and also won the World Duathlon Championships in 1996 - to become the only person ever to claim both world titles in the same year . As if that wasn't a big enough feat - she also won the World Duathlon Championships in 1996 to become the only person ever to claim both world titles in the same year.

She then went on to collect the bronze medal in the marathon in the 2002 Commonwealth Games and win the Gold Coast Marathon in 2005. Gallagher changed her surname in 2004 after marrying Australian Olympic archery champion Simon Fairweather. An overwhelming number of tweets are pouring in for Fairweather on Twitter . Fairweather had a Master of Science degree in Exercise Physiology and worked as a senior sports consultant at the Australian Sports Commission. She was also the inaugural coach of the Australian Institute of Sport Triathlon program between 2001 and 2005. The tributes on Twitter show how Fairweather's peers held her in a very high regard and were absolutely devastated by her shocking passing. Marathon runner Lee troop posted on Twitter that Fairweather left 'a massive legacy & will never be forgotten.' He also described her as 'tough as nails as a competitor but gentle spirit.' Brumbies rugby coach Kate Gazzard spoke of Fairweather inspiring her to become a triathlete. 'This amazing woman was one of the reasons I started triathlon,' she posted. While sports journalist Nicole Jeffery said she was proud to call Fairweather her friend. 'She would be surprised to know how many people loved her and valued her.'

"Trying to remember all the different speed limits and road signs during your driving theory test can stump even the most dedicated of learner drivers. But one man found himself in a real jam when was arrested by police after he was caught blatantly cheating - by ‘phoning a friend.’ The 39-year-old learner driver was sitting the exam at a test centre when staff spotted a Bluetooth earpiece suddenly fall to the floor. One man was arrested by police after he was caught blatantly cheating - by 'phoning a friend' Using a hidden mobile phone, the exam candidate had been communicating the theory questions via the Bluetooth to a remote friend. The friend was then leafing through a copy of the Highway Code, finding the answer to the multiple choice question and then relaying it back to him. The theory test is made up of a multiple-choice part – which the candidate has 57 minutes to complete and a hazard perception test where 14 one-minute videos are shown and the candidate has to use the mouse on the computer to respond to a series of hazards. You need to pass both parts to pass the theory test and then have two years to pass the practical driving test. If you fall to pass the practical within two years learners have to re-sit the theory test. The incident happened during a driving theory test held at Piccadilly Gardens in Manchester on Monday shortly before lunchtime. It is understood he was more than half way through the 50-question theory test when the Bluetooth device flipped out of his ear and fell on the floor. The incident happened during a driving theory test held at Piccadilly Gardens in Manchester on Monday shortly before lunchtime . Shocked staff saw it fall and immediately suspended the theory test and called the police who arrived and then arrested the man. He was questioned by police and admitted trying to cheat during the theory test and accepted a police caution for carrying an article for the use of fraud. Under current guidelines the man from Birmingham  – who had no previous convictions – could have faced a maximum 26 week prison sentence for the offence. Greater Manchester Police City Centre tweeted: ‘Odd arrest yesterday - man sits written driving test with earpiece which allows him to 'phone a friend.' Worst thing was, he failed the test.’ Inspector Phil Spurgeon said: ‘His was an audacious attempt to cheat on the driving theory test by using an earpiece to receive the correct answers. ‘However, thanks to the vigilance of staff who saw the device fall on the floor this man was caught red-handed and has subsequently received a police caution. ‘He failed the test because he did not complete the exam which was immediately cancelled. Obviously it was not a particularly sophisticated method of cheating but it should send out a message to anyone considering this that they will be caught and punished.’ The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency, which holds the theory exams, which has a multiple choice section and hazard perception section, in centres across the country including Piccadilly Gardens.

Murder scene: A photograph issued today by prosecutors of the classroom at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds, where Ann Maguire was stabbed to death in April . Murder: William Cornick (left) was jailed for life with a minimum of 20 years for the killing of Ann Maguire (right) Mrs Maguire was left with stab wounds as bad as any the paramedic who attended had ever seen, including one wound which went straight through her neck and another that cut her jugular vein. Despite this, the teacher managed to leave the classroom, pursued by the boy until a colleague bundled her into a room and held the door shut. Leeds Crown Court heard how the boy went back into the classroom, sat down and said ‘good times’ in front of his traumatised classmates. Cornick, who murdered the teacher in a ‘monumental act of cowardice and evil’ has been warned he may never be released from prison by a judge who found his lack of remorse ‘truly grotesque’. Mr Justice Coulson told the teenager - who stabbed Mrs Maguire seven times from behind as she taught - that he must serve at least 20 years in custody before he is ever considered for released. But he warned the boy, who was 15 when he killed his Spanish teacher, that, having read about him, ‘it's quite possible that day may never come’. School building: In an attack that shocked the nation, Cornick winked at another boy before he launched into a savage assault in front of a terrified class full of pupils . The court heard how the teenager held a deep hatred of Mrs Maguire and had planned her murder, telling many of his friends of his desire to kill her. After the murder he told experts that he ‘couldn't give a s***’ and added: ‘Everything I've done is fine and dandy.’ Teachers and police who detained Cornick said he showed a bizarre calmness which continued as he was assessed by a range of experts. The court heard he has never shown any remorse and has spoken of his pride in what he has done. When Cornick was sentenced today, as with when he was stabbing Mrs Maguire to death, he showed no emotion. Cornick who the court heard came from came from a loving and supportive family, had also talked of attacking other school staff, including a pregnant woman ‘so as to kill her unborn child’.","William Cornick, 16, jailed for at least 20 years for killing Ann Maguire, 61 .

"Maddison Murphy-West was found dead on October 23, 2013, at her home in Melbourne . A year since 20-year-old Maddison Murphy-West’s body was found at her home police now believe a killer could have covered up her murder to make it look like she had committed suicide. Homicide detectives believe that Maddison’s body could have been disguised as self harm, which is what her family have believed to be the case all along, and are seeking advice on whether murder charges should be laid. Detectives are preparing a brief of evidence to present to the Office of Public Prosecutions, the Herald Sun reports. On October 23, 2013, the day of her death, Maddy's young son Noah was found alone inside her Pakenham home, in Melbourne. He is now living with Maddison’s mother, Paula . A spokesperson for Victoria Police told Daily Mail Australia: ‘The investigation is ongoing and homicide detectives have been in liaison with Maddison’s family. It is not appropriate to comment at this time.’ Alarmingly, Maddison had been treated in hospital for an assault 13-months before her death and her family believe she was often in fear for her life. Paula said that in 2012 marks were found on Maddison's neck but the young mother dismissed someone had tried to choke her and claimed it was ‘play-fighting’. Police believe the crime scene was tampered with after her death, something her relatives have also previously claimed. They also say money was withdrawn from her account after her death. Maddison has been described as a doting young mother. Her son Noah was found nearby inside her  home, on the day of her death . Her mother Paula said when police knocked on her door she knew that Maddison was dead before they even spoke. 'I said, ""What's he done to her? What's he done to her?"",’ Paula told the Herald Sun. Maddison has been described by friends as ‘cheerful’ and a ‘go-getter’ Friend Meaghan Vander Ree said Maddison was an amazing mother and that she had lived with her boyfriend and their son in their Ahern Road home for three years. Since Maddy’s death, her friends and family have continued to campaign for justice. In March, Maddy’s high school friends held a rally to raise money for her two-year-old son Noah. Over $5000 was raised on the day, with the proceeds being donated to a trust fund for Noah’s education. Police believe a killer could have covered up her murder to make it look like she’d committed suicide . Maddy's friends and family have continued to campaign for justice since her death 12 months ago . Maddy’s friend Oakley Hansen told the Berwick News on the day: ‘We were in the same boat, we both had young children. ‘My daughter’s just a little bit younger than Noah so we always had that in common which is always something that brought us closer. ‘We were both young mums trying to raise our kids the right way and we just got along really well.’ Paula was also at the rally and said she was overwhelmed by the support the community had shown. ‘It’s hard to put it into words; I'm still in a bit of shock with everything anyway. Something like this shows how much support’s out there,’ Paula said. A Facebook page full of photos to remember Maddy has also been created. ‘On the 23/10/2013 we not only lost our good friend but a beautiful daughter and mother You will always be forever in our hearts, We will all cherish our memories with you forever. Rest In Peace Baby Untill we meet again, [sic]’ it reads. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Maddison's family for comment.

"Wind farms have been paid £43million to stand idle so far this year, a new British record. The payments, funded through householders’ electricity bills, were made to suppliers because the National Grid was unable to use their electricity. The sums paid in ‘constraint payments’ to wind farms have risen rapidly in the past four years, according to electricity market data. Wind farms have been paid £43million to stand idle  after producing too much energy for the National Grid . The total with two months still to go has already far surpassed the £32million paid in the whole of 2013. Payments totalled £6million in 2012 and £174,000 in 2010. High winds last month set new daily records for compensation - with £3.07million paid to 33 wind farms to switch off on a single day, October 26. John Constable, of the Renewable Energy Foundation which campaigns against energy subsidies, said too many wind farms had been built too quickly, without the infrastructure to cope with the power. Officials are also pandering to suppliers running the Government’s ‘pet technology’, he said, allowing them to charge whatever they wanted to switch off. The wind industry claims the payments are justified because of the operational costs involved in switching off. They say other energy industries, such as coal plants, can far more easily stop production and save money when they do so. But critics point out that the high value of payments reflect a fundamental problem with wind power. Ed Dave,  Energy Secretary, said acting to scrap wind power was a 'dangerous' idea . Wind turbines are inherently unpredictable, depending on the weather, and so must be controlled to stop surges causing physical damage to electricity cables and equipment. The windiest places are often the furthest away from cities where the power is needed, meaning high transmission costs. The overwhelming majority of the payments to date have been to wind farms in Scotland, where the bulk of wind farms are located. Electricity demand in Scotland does not match the power produced on the windier days, but cable networks to take the power south into England have not yet been constructed. As a result National Grid has to pay the wind farm owners to stop generating in order to keep supply and demand balanced. Renewable UK, which represents the wind industry, points out that wind power is reaching more homes than ever before – supplying a record 24 per cent of the nation’s electricity on one particularly windy day last month. Jennifer Webber, its director of external affairs, said last in October: ‘Wind power is often used as a convenient whipping boy by political opponents and vested interests. ‘All the while, it’s been quietly powering millions of homes across the UK and providing a robust response to its vocal detractors.’ But Dr Constable said: ‘Managing wind power is a very expensive business. 'We built too much, too quickly. It is unpredictable and because it tends to be sited in a location a long way from people, it costs a lot to transmit. ‘Building more grid is given as the answer, but that is very expensive - it would have been cheaper not to build these wind farms in the first place. ‘They are charging very high prices to switch off - far higher than the cost of actually producing the power - but officials will not challenge them because this the Government’s pet technology.’ The cost of wind power has become an increasingly divisive issue at the heart of Government. David Cameron has pledged to place new limits on onshore wind farms if the Tories win a majority at the next election, a policy that has been bitterly opposed by Liberal Democrats. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem Energy Secretary, last week said acting to scrap wind power was a dangerous and populist idea. Speaking in the House of Commons, he attacked ‘anti-renewables, anti-wind tendency’ of his Conservative Coalition colleagues. He said: ‘It is imperative that these tendencies are resisted, particularly in the run-up to the general election. Short-term populism is the most dangerous enemy energy and climate change policy has.’ Defending the constraint payments yesterday, a spokesman for Mr Davey’s Department of Energy and Climate Change said: ‘National Grid has been paying coal and gas generators – and others – to change their planned output well before wind farms joined the mix. ‘In fact, the majority of compensation goes to fossil fuel generators rather than onshore wind farms. The impact on energy bills is negligible.’ Energy regulator Ofgem told the Sunday Telegraph: ‘National Grid’s costs for making these payments have increased as more renewable generators have connected to Britain’s networks before investment programmes have been completed to build new capacity. ‘Last year Ofgem approved a major eight-year network investment programme to address this through renewing and building new capacity.’ The wind industry said it receives a tiny proportion of the budget spent on balancing electricity demand. A spokesman for Renewable UK said last night: ‘Constraint payments are one of the tools National Grid use to manage the supply and demand of electricity, with payments going to different types of generators, both renewables and fossil fuels. ‘Last year wind received just 5 per cent of the total payments for balancing the grid, equating to 65p a year on the average household bill.’","Millions given to wind farms in 'constraint payments' for unused energy .

"Nathan Dyer feels focusing on high-flying Swansea is the key to fulfilling his England dream. The in-form Dyer scored twice in the 3-0 home victory over West Brom on Saturday which briefly took Swansea to the top of the Barclays Premier League before Chelsea won 6-3 at Everton. The previous week Dyer scored the winner against Burnley and some pundits felt the 26-year-old was unfortunate to not make Roy Hodgson’s England squad for next week’s friendly against Norway and the opening Euro 2016 qualifier in Switzerland on September 8. In form: Dyer strikes for the second time against West Brom as Swansea went top of the league . Recognition: The English winger is hoping his good form will lead t an international call-up . Hodgson’s wide options include Andros Townsend and James Milner even though neither player has started a Premier League game this season, and Swansea boss Garry Monk said on Saturday that his two wingers, Dyer and Wayne Routledge, could count themselves unlucky not to make the England squad on current form. But Dyer says all he can do to win an England call-up is is keep on performing well for a Swansea side who have won their opening three games and will head to Chelsea after the international break full of confidence. “Obviously it would be an honour to play for England and any player would love to play for their country,” Dyer said. “I’m one of them but I’ve got no say what happens and all I can do is keep playing well and keep improving for Swansea. Partner in crime: Wayne Routledge scored an excellent goal against West Brom and is also in great form . “I’m really enjoying my football at the moment, but I’m going to keep my head down and keep playing for Swansea.” Swansea made light work of West Brom at the Liberty Stadium side as the Welsh club secured their best start to a campaign for 91 years. But Dyer insists Swansea can get even better after taking nine points from nine. “I feel there’s more improvement to come,” Dyer said. “The balance of our team when we’re attacking can’t be too complacent, but we created opportunities with our movement and we’ve got to take that into the next game.” Alan Irvine is still seeking his first league win as West Brom manager and will use the forthcoming international break to get his new recruits up to speed as quickly as possible. West Brom had a huge turnover of players during the summer and Irvine says the new signings are still in the process of getting to know each other. Harsh: Gary Monk thinks both of his wide men are unlucky not to be in Roy Hodgson's squad . “We’ve got a group of lads who are ready and a group of lads who need some work,” said Irvine. “Some of them will be doing a mini pre-season next week with a view to being closer to being available the following week. “It’s been a big ask for the boys who have come in lately and some of them were on the pitch at Swansea, but we’ve got to get through that.” West Brom completed the signing of 26-year-old Argentine winger Sebastien Blanco from Ukrainian side Metalist Kharkiv on Saturday afternoon and Irvine said that will be the last piece of Albion transfer business before the window closes on Monday night. “We’re done now, the work has been done - the positions we targeted at the start have now been filled,” said Irvine. “That will be our squad going forward and we will give the players time to settle in. “That’s difficult during a Premier League campaign but we don’t have any other choice, and I don’t expect any to go out.” Work to do: Alan Irvine says his eleven new sigings will need time to gel together this season .","Swansea winger has scored three times already this season .

"Australia's top female criminal prosecutor, Margaret Cunneen, has told a court corruption body ICAC has no business investigating her private life. Ms Cunneen launched an urgent action in the NSW Supreme Court this morning against the Independent Commission Against Corruption claims, which claims she perverted the course of justice and instructed her son's girlfriend, 25-year-old Sophia Tilley to fake chest pains to beat a drink driving test in May this year. Ms Cunneen, who is a familiar figure in Sydney courts on the bench prosecuting gang rapists and murderers, is the principal plaintiff in today's court action along with her son, Stephen Wyllie, 26 and his 25-year-old girlfriend, Sophia Tilley. Scroll down for video . Top prosecutor: Lawyers for Margaret Cunneen, SC, a familiar figure in Sydney courts prosecuting gang rapists and murderers, have taken action against corruption body ICAC over claims she instructed her son's girlfriend to fake chest pains to beat a drink driving breath test . Under fire: Stephen Wyllie (pictured, right), Ms Cunneen's 26-year-old son and his girlfriend, Sophia Tilly, 25 (above, left) are also parties in the NSW Supreme Court action proceeding against the Independent Commission Against Corruption today . Ms Cunneen did not show up personally, however her counsel Arthur Moses, QC, argued that just because she holds public office doesn't mean she loses ' the rights of any other citizen when a matter arises in their personal life which has nothing to do with their public function'. He said neither Ms Cunneen nor any other public official including 'dog catchers and rangers' should lose their rights as private citizens. He said Ms Cunnen's role as deputy senior crown prosecutor was 'irrelevant' in the case of the car crash investigation. 'You have a state body making a decision impacting on the rights of citizens,' he said. Seeking documents: Margaret Cunneen, SC, will be on the other side of the court room today when she seeks documents tracing the origin of the 'malicious complaint' which may have landed her before ICAC . Since the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) launched action against Ms Cunneen last week, the widely respected NSW deputy senior Crown prosecutor has received a groundswell of support from senior figures in the Australian legal fraternity. The ICAC hearing to investigate allegations of perverting the course of justice against Ms Cunneen is due to begin next Monday. The action, which has been described as a 'witch hunt',  could 'only be the result of a malicious complaint', the 55-year-old mother of three sons told Daily Mail Australia. Ms Cunneen launched her Supreme Court action on Tuesday to challenge the ICAC's power to investigate the claim, and to seek documents and a copy of the 'allegation or complaint' which set off the Commission's investigation into Ms Cunneen, her son and Ms Tilley. Mr Moses asked Justice Clifton Hoeben to eject ICAC from an active presence in the court proceedings, arguing it 'endangers the impartiality' of the Commission to rule in the looming hearing against Ms Cunneen. 'If the Commission becomes the protagonist it endangers their impartiality in subsequent hearings,' Mr Moses said. He said Ms Cunneen and her fellow applicants were demanding ICAC's reasons for mounting the investigation in the first place. 'They don't have any get out of jail free card,' he said, 'they are accountable like anybody else.' But counsel for ICAC, Mr Kirk, said the Commission would resist explaining in court as to why the charges of perverting the course of justice had been laid. Mr Moses is seeking an order restraining the ICAC from taking further steps in relation to the investigation, the reasons why the action was taken, and a declaration that the commission is acting outside its jurisdiction. The car crash at the centre of the ICAC claims happened on May 31, when Ms Tilley, 25, was driving Ms Cunneen's Ford Mondeo and she was hit by another vehicle in Willoughby, on Sydney's north shore. The Mondeo was knocked onto its side and Ms Tilley was trapped in her seat belt for some time. Daily Mail Australia understands once Ms Tilley was freed from the vehicle she called her boyfriend Mr Wyllie, who called his father Greg Wyllie. Mr Wyllie snr then told Ms Cunneen. Ms Tilley, who has breast implants, reported experiencing chest pain at the scene. There was some fear the implants may have ruptured. The two Wyllies arrived at the accident scene on foot. By the time Ms Cunneen arrived by car Ms Tilley was in an ambulance. She was taken to Royal North Shore Hospital where a blood test showed no alcohol in her system. Ms Tilley was not at fault in the accident. Daily Mail Australia has revealed that ICAC investigators seized the mobile telephones of Ms Cunneen, Mr Wyllie and Ms Tilley in unannounced morning raids at their respective homes two months after the accident, on July 30. Until that day, none of the trio was aware of any investigation into events following the crash, which happened in May. Mr Wyllie and Ms Tilley were subsequently called to private ICAC hearings in August. Since ICAC Launched its action, there has been an outcry from legal figures including former NSW State cabinet head, Professor Gary Sturgess, that the matter should have been investigated by police. Justice Hoeben has previously ruled against Margaret Cunneen, in 2007 when she was prosecuting in the retrial of convicted gang rapist Bilal Skaf. One of three judges on the Court of Criminal Appeal, Justice Hoeben ruled Ms Cunneen should not participate in the retrial because she had made public  statements about the case of Skaf and his fellow gang rapists which would compromise 'appropriate fairness and detachment'. In a separate action, the acting Inspector of the ICAC, prominent former Supreme Court judge David Levine, QC, announced he was conducting an audit into the Commission's action against Ms Cunneen.

"Britain’s chaotic immigration system has seen a dramatic rise in the asylum backlog as officials struggle to get a grip on controls at our borders. The pile of 'pending' applications waiting to be dealt with has soared by almost a quarter in a year, with the most dramatic rises since Home Secretary Theresa May shut the discredited UK Border Agency. There are fears that attempts to clear the logjam will lead to terrorists and dangerous offenders being allowed to stay in the UK after appeal to reduce the burden of more paperwork. The number of pending cases awaiting an initial decision hit 22,207, up 23 per cent in a year and the highest level since the coalition was formed in May 2010 . The government faces fierce criticism . for both failing to remove people who pose a threat to Britain and not . resolving the cases of those who qualify for refuge from oppressive and . dangerous regimes overseas. Latest . figures show that in October there were 22,207 pending asylum cases, up . 23 per cent in a year and the highest level since the coalition was . formed in May 2010. In the months after David Cameron took power the number of pending asylum . applications gradually fell, reaching a low of 14,188 in May 2011. But since then the number awaiting an initial decision has soared dramatically by more than 50 per cent. The . sharpest increase came after Home Secretary Theresa May moved to shut . the UK Border Agency after repeated criticism for its failure to get a . grip on the crisis. Asylum cases are now the responsibility of UK Visas and Immigration within the Home Office. From September to October the number rose by 7 per cent in a single month - 1,398 cases. The . Home Office blamed the rise in cases pending in part on a 14 per cent increase in the . number of asylum applications it dealt with in 2013 compared to a year . earlier. But some . immigration lawyers accused the Home Office of withdrawing growing . numbers of cases if they think they will lose appeals, creating further . delays. In March Home Secretary Theresa May moved to break up the UK Border Agency after five years of catastrophic failure . Labour’s shadow immigration minister . David Hanson said: ‘These figures reveal the scale of the incompetence . and backlogs under this Government despite Theresa May’s promise to get a . grip. ‘It’s now urgent that the Home Secretary actually takes real action to solve this backlog. ‘It’s . unacceptable that people are remaining indefinitely in the country . because the Home Secretary’s department can’t make decisions and each . month is simply adding cases to the backlog when people apply for . asylum.’ As more cases arrive each month, the numbers which have not been dealt with for six months has also risen sharply. From . a low of 2,848 six-month old cases in October 2011, the number of . long-delayed applications has rocketed by 175 per cent to 7,846. One . immigration lawyer told MailOnline that Home Office Presenting Officers . dealing with asylum cases are now judged on their success rates, so if . they think they will lose a case it will often be withdrawn. 'When . these withdrawn decisions are sent back to case owners, it is not . unusual for them to get caught up in the backlog of delayed decisions,' the lawyer said. 'There are often further significant delays before we receive a 'final' decision. 'This, . in association with the increasing delay in initial asylum decisions, . has caused further misery for many of those who fear persecution in . their countries of origin.' The number of cases not dealt with within six months has also risen sharply to almost 8,000 having fallen below 3,000 in 2011 . Last year the home affairs select committee warned that some people have been waiting for up to 16 years for a decision on their asylum application. It also raised fears about rushed decisions to grant asylum to people ‘who later emerge to be involved with terrorist activity’. Mr Hanson added: ‘We need a robust but fair immigration system where decisions are made quickly and people who are rejected are made to leave the country, whilst ensuring that those who genuinely need asylum can get it. ‘After nearly four years in Government, Theresa May’s immigration policies are in shambles.  We need action now to sort out this mess.’ Labour's shadow immigration minister David Hanson said Home Secretary Theresa May had to get a grip . In March Mrs May killed off the UK Border Agency after five years of catastrophic failure. The . agency behind a string of disastrous immigration scandals was cut in . two and brought into the Home Office under ministers’ control. Mrs . May admitted the agency, set up under Labour, had been ‘troubled’ and . condemned its ‘closed, secretive and defensive culture’. She also said fixing the system and clearing the huge backlog of cases would take ‘many years’. A Home Office spokesman said: 'The UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who need it. We are committed to completing applications as quickly as possible, but asylum cases are often complex and require full and thorough consideration. 'Asylum applications in the year to September 2013 were up 14 per cent on 2012 and this increase in applications has impacted on casework time. 'Despite this, in 2012-13, 78 per cent of initial decisions were taken within six months, and 54 per cent within 30 days.'","Surge in the number of cases which have not even been considered .

"A soldier who survived the Somme and fought at Ypres was left for dead after being shot in the stomach at Passchendale, his son has revealed. The body of Robert Collie was then thrown onto a heap of corpses while he was still alive and he was only saved after a passing India medic saw him twitching. He survived his wounds and returned to the fighting, serving in India after World War I finished and rising through the ranks from Private to Major. William 'Robert' Collie survived the Somme and Ypres before being left for dead after being shot during Passchedale. He was thrown onto a pile of bodies but saved when a passing medic saw him twitch . Sadly Collie lost both of his brothers after they were wounded in action during the war, and his sister who was killed by a Zeppelin during a bombing raid in London. The story of the Scottish soldier who refused to die has only now come to light after his son, also called Robert, decided to sell his 13 medals. Robert, 75, from Eastbourne, East Sussex, said: 'My father was a tough Scotsman and not a lot phased him. 'But the loss of his elder and younger brother and sister in such a short space of time must have been the most terrible thing to endure. 'He hardly ever spoke about the war when he was alive. I managed to get a few things out of him but the rest I have found out on the internet. Major Collie earned 13 medals during his service. From left to right, they are: MBE, 1914 Star, 1914-18 War medal, Victory medal, 1939-45 Star, Burma Star, World War II War medal, 1939-45 India medal, 1935 and 1937 Commemorative medals,George IV and Queen Elizabeth Coronation medal, George V Long Service medal, George V Meritorious Service medal . The medal set and paperwork are being sold by Robert's son, also called Robert, and may fetch £1,200 . 'He fought at the Somme where the Allies lost 57,000 men on the first day. He fought at Ypres and was badly wounded at Passchendale. 'His colleagues thought he was dead and he was thrown on a load of dead bodies. 'An Indian doctor then saw him twitch and pulled him off and treated him and saved his life. Within a year and was back fighting again.' As well as dealing with his own personal grief, Major Collie had to deal with the deaths of his two brothers. The eldest brother, William, enlisted as a Private with the Canadian Infantry in 1916. He had emigrated to Toronto from Dufftown, in Banffshire, after marrying his bride, Agnes. Alongside the medals Collie, who was a talented boxer, was presented with this inscribed box for his services to the sport in Calcutta where he served after the First World War finished . The father-of-six was listed as missing assumed killed in action during the Battle of Vimy Ridge in 1917 aged just 37. His body was never found and his name appears on the Huntly and Mortlach War Memorials in Scotland. Little is known about Maj Collie's younger brother John. He served as a private in the Gordon Highlanders Regiment and died in 1916. Maj Collie saw his brother at Dover with severe injuries to his legs which he never recovered from. Even once the war was over the heartbreak did not end for Collie as his wife, Ida, became ill with tuberculosis in 1933 and also died. Sadly 15 years after the war which killed his two brothers and sister finished, Collie was bereft again by the untimely death of his wife Ida. He then married his second wife Kathleen before going on to have children . Robert, a semi-retired accountant, added: 'My father met and married my mother, Kathleen, while she worked as a children's nurse in Calcutta in 1937 and I was born a year later. 'I inherited the medals from him. My two children don't really want them and I thought I would look to give them a good home now.' His impressive medal set comprises of the MBE, 1914 Star, 1914-18 War medal, Victory medal, 1939-45 Star, Burma Star, World War II War medal, 1939-45 India medal, 1935 and 1937 Commemorative medals, George IV and Queen Elizabeth Coronation medal, George V Long Service medal, George V Meritorious Service medal. Collie was also a talented boxer and the collection includes white metal box with the inscription 'Presented to Lt. R. Collie M.B.E., I.C.C. for Services Rendered to Army Boxing 1936-38 by The Military Boxing Committee, Calcutta'. The medals are being sold by Eastbourne Auctions and are expected to fetch £1,200. Auctioneer Jeanette May said: 'Major Collie's is a incredible story that is tinged with great personal tragedy and sadness yet he mustered up the strength to carry on fighting.'","Robert Collie served in the army during the First World War .

"This is the pregnant teacher who schoolboy Will Cornick wanted to murder in front of other children. The crazed 16-year-old fantasised about brutally taking the life of Sinéad Miley’s unborn child. Cornick also intended to target Andrew Kellett, his head of year, in the atrocity he spent three years meticulously planning. He stabbed Spanish teacher Ann Maguire, 61, to death in her classroom, but was not able to carry out his aim of attacking the other two staff members. Scroll down for video . Other targets: William Cornick had said he would stab pregnant Corpus Christi Catholic College languages teacher Sinéad Miley (left) and kill head of year Andrew Kellett (right) Mrs Miley, 38, is believed to have had a baby girl, and is on maternity leave. She declined to comment from her family home in South Yorkshire yesterday. On the morning he murdered Mrs Maguire, Cornick told a girl in school he intended to stab Miss Miley in the stomach ‘so as to kill her unborn child’. The court heard ‘he had not had the slightest problem’ with the teacher and there was no explanation as to why he should want to target her. Mrs Miley had been a pupil at Corpus Christi before returning as a teacher. She was close to Mrs Maguire, and her tribute to the much-loved ‘mother of the school’ was read in court. It said: ‘Ann Maguire was such an amazing woman and teacher. She taught me when I was a pupil and supported me in my career since I have been teaching at Corpus. Ann loved her job and wanted all her kids to work hard and reach their full potential.’ Murder: Cornick (left) was jailed for life with a minimum of 20 years for killing Ann Maguire (right) in Leeds . The court heard that Cornick told fellow pupils Mr Kellett, an assistant headmaster, was also on his seemingly random hit list. Again there was no known reason for his implacable hatred, although it did emerge that Mr Kellett had spoken to Cornick two months before the murder after he defied a ban on going to a bowling trip imposed by Mrs Maguire for not doing homework. When Mrs Maguire came into the meeting, Cornick stood up to walk out. This led to another meeting the next day with the teenager’s parents. It is not clear whether this incident increased his hatred of Mr Kellett. Teenage killer: Cornick, 16, sits in the dock at Leeds Crown Court during his sentencing hearing . On Monday, Cornick was given a life term and told he would stay locked up for a minimum of 20 years. Passing sentence at Leeds Crown Court, Mr Justice Coulson said experts considered him such a danger that he might die behind bars. His crime has shocked the public, leading to concerns over why he was never reported to the authorities. Yesterday Leeds City Council announced that an inquiry, dubbed a ‘learning lessons review’, would be held to report on ‘all circumstances’ surrounding the tragedy. No remorse: Schoolboy Cornick (left) had an image of the Grim Reaper (right) at the top of his Facebook page . Cornick messaged his friends on Facebook about his intentions, and his irrational fury at Mrs Maguire was known to the school and his parents. In the attack, which it emerged he spent three years planning, he brought a large kitchen knife to school and stabbed Mrs Maguire repeatedly in the back and neck from behind as she worked at her desk. Teenagers fled screaming and the teacher staggered into a corridor where she was helped into a side room by a brave colleague who put herself between Cornick and his victim. The murderer returned to his desk, saying ‘Good times’, and waited calmly to be arrested. It later emerged the then 15-year-old had sent chilling messages on Facebook in which he spoke of ‘brutally killing’ Mrs Maguire and spending the rest of his life behind bars. In one post he wrote she deserved ‘more than death more than pain’. Scene: The classroom at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds, where Cornick killed Mrs Maguire in April . The inquiry will be carried out by the Leeds Safeguarding Children Board and headed by its independent chairman Jane Held, a national expert on child protection issues with more than 30 years’ experience. Mrs Held said: ‘Our thoughts and deepest sympathies remain with all those affected by this tragic event. ‘Following this unprecedented incident the members of the Leeds Safeguarding Children Board have already agreed to work with the school and other agencies, to look into all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, and help with any learning for all agencies involved.’ A decision on whether to hold a serious case review – a more formal form of investigation – has not yet been made. The safeguarding board inquiry team will involve members from the council, police, health and education services. A spokesman said it was ‘very likely’ that the team’s report will be published, although it is ‘not a requirement’ to do so. ‘They will be looking at everything and talking to everybody involved,’ said the spokesman. On the morning of the murder Cornick showed other pupils knives and told them he intended to attack the teacher, but no one took him seriously enough to report him. Victim's family: (from left) Mrs Maguire's daughters Emma and Kerry and widower Don at Leeds Crown Court following the sentencing of Cornick for the teacher's murder . Although his extreme dislike of Mrs Maguire was known to the school it is not clear whether any members of staff had heard talk about his murder plan. Too harsh: Penelope Gibbs, chairman of the Standing Committee for Youth Justice, said the sentence given to murderer William Cornick was too long . The headmaster of Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds was not available for comment. Public fury over the crime was yesterday fuelled by comments from a senior youth justice campaigner, who said the sentence was too long. Penelope Gibbs, the chairman of the Standing Committee for Youth Justice (SCYJ) umbrella group of charities and campaign groups, said: ‘I don’t think a child – and he was a child – should get a life sentence because they are young, their brain is not mature and a life sentence is indeterminate, it could last forever. I think no other western European country would impose a life sentence on a teenager. ‘Do we want him to be rehabilitated? Do we want him to leave prison the lowest risk possible of causing more harm to others? Yes. How long do we need to achieve that, rather than how long do we need to punish him for. ‘We do need to punish him but I think to punish him for longer than he’s been alive for is disproportionate.’ But she received an internet backlash from parents who supported a long prison term. Emma Sutcliffe commented: ‘Mrs Maguire taught me 20 years ago, my daughter was two classrooms away when this happened. Too light a sentence? Not at all… he was on his way to attack other teachers and one of those was pregnant! He deserved to be sectioned for life to be totally honest.’ Louise Longbottom, the mother of a pupil ‘in the next classroom’, also welcomed the lengthy sentence. She said the family have to ‘live with this everyday’ and the parents have been left to ‘pick up the pieces.’","William Cornick killed Spanish teacher Mrs Maguire, 61, in Leeds in April .

"A bitter feud that has torn apart the family of the man who built the euro and reunited his country according to a new book. Helmut Kohl, who ruled West Germany before reunifying the country in 1990, is estranged from his two sons, who accuse his second wife of 'imprisoning him'. Walter and Peter Kohl claim their stepmother Maike Kohl-Richter, who is much younger than the former Chancellor, has caused a rift in the family that has led to their father's increasing isolation. 'Stalker': Maike Richter-Kohl has been accused of causing a rift between former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, pictured together last year, and his two sons Walter and Peter . Affair: The sons say they were told by a friend of Helmut Kohl that he had an affair with Maike Richter in the years before popular wife Hannelore, left, killed herself . They say Mr Kohl, 82, who is barely able to walk or speak following a serious fall five years ago, is being kept a ‘prisoner’ by Maike Kohl-Richter, 49, who decides who can see him and writes his letters. His sons have branded her a virtual 'stalker' and claim his father started an affair with her while still married to their beloved mother Hannelore. Hannelore killed herself in 2001 after suffering for years from a debilitating condition which made her allergic to light. Her sons were devoted to her but distant to their father, who they claimed was 'married to politics' as they grew up. Now their bitterness is directed at Maike, 49, with Peter Kohl claiming she has even had him and his brother removed from the visitor list kept by police allowing access to his home near Karlsruhe. Since his fall Mr Kohl's days of drinking several bottles . of fine Rhine wine to wash down his favourite dish - stuffed pig's . stomach - are long gone. He . sees very few people from his old political days with his sons claiming . his second wife is a gatekeeper who controls every second of his time. Heartache: The Kohl family at a memorial service for Hannelore after her suicide in 2001. Sons Peter (left, holding wife Elif's hand) and Walter (second left) say they have been barred from seeing their father Helmut . Damning account: Maike is accused of creating her own personal 'Helmut Kohl museum' at her home . It has long been known that Walter and Peter Kohl grew up unhappy in the home of Europe's greatest statesmen; Walter wrote a book two years ago stating as much. But the new work by Peter, a biography of his mother that is a tribute to her and the way she brought them up, is damning of their stepmother. He says he learned of his father's marriage to his former secretary over the internet. He said: 'The picture I saw was of a sickly old man, his sad eyes looking as if he wanted helping. 'I think she (Maike) moved quickly to erase all connections and memories of Hannelore Kohl, her children and grandchildren.' Peter recalls visiting his stepmother's apartment in Berlin before she married him, stating: 'Every conversation with her was a hymn of praise about my father. Her flat in Berlin was full of pictures and souvenirs of my father which made me think of a propaganda film about him. 'I was in some kind of private Helmut Kohl museum. There was Helmut Kohl photography standing or hanging wherever you looked. It was years of careful collection to serve a hero-worship... as one might know from reports about stalkers.' Kohl-Richter has been criticised in the past by the German press who called her the 'Lady Macbeth of Oggersheim' and said she angered the public after being spotted wearing some of Hannelore Kohl's clothes. Adored: Hannelore Kohl, with sons Walter, left, and Peter, right, remains popular with the German public . The sons claim their stepmother has also cut off ties to their father's ghostwriter. 'For my father this is all unbelievably damaging and reprehensible,' Peter said. 'I find her responsible for all of this damage. One cannot deal with the intellectual heritage of my father like this.' Most hurtfully, says Peter, is the knowledge that his father began his affair with her when his mother was still alive. 'A close confidante of my father dated the relationship from the second half of the 1990's,' he said. 'I don't know but I have no reason to doubt it.' Peter nearly broke down on a TV show last week when he described the last time he had seen their father when he visited him with his own daughter two years ago. Statesman: Helmut Kohl helped create the Euro and was a key figurehead in the reunification of Germany . He says he had been initially pleased to . see them but then indicated they should go 'otherwise there will be a . huge problem again.' Left unsaid was that the problem was his new bride. The revelations have come in a new 27-page forward to the 2002 book Hannelore Kohl: Her Life, which is re-released this week.

"A defiant Manuel Pellegrini believes that Manchester City can avoid Champions League elimination and still be crowned kings of Europe this season - even though 'five or six squads' in the competition are better than theirs. The Premier League champions are on the brink of disaster after picking up two points from their opening three Group E games, and must beat CSKA Moscow at the Etihad on Wednesday night to keep alive their chances of qualifying for the knockout stage. But Pellegrini insists that City can beat the odds by sneaking out of the group phase with a low points total and go on to win the competition. Manchester City players train at the Etihad stadium ahead of Wednesday's clash with CSKA Moscow . Joe Hart is put through his paces ahead of the crucial Champions League clash against the Russians . City's players warm up on the pitch at the Etihad ahead of a game they know they must win . ‘There are teams that qualify with few points and then after that they won the Champions League,’ said Pellegrini. ‘Of course our target is always to try and win the Champions League. We must put in our mind that we are able to do it, that we have a good squad. ‘Maybe there are also five or six squads better than our squad or the same level as our squad that also want to do it but with a winning mentality and an ambitious mind, you must always think you can do it.

'We have to finish the qualifying (stage) and then we can make all the conclusions and analyse what happened with this team in Champions League.’ Having lost their opening game to Bayern Munich, City have suffered disappointing draws after surrendering leads to Roma and CSKA. Pellegrini denied that his players lack confidence in Europe, and predicted that the group will not be decided until final game in Rome next month. He added: ‘The three games of the Champions League were strange games I think. We were very unlucky to lose against Bayern Munich, the most difficult game of the group in the last minute with the rebound of the set-piece. England stars Hart and James Milner look in good spirits ahead of the crucial game against CSKA . Manuel Pelligrini has denied that Wednesday's game is 'sudden death' but admits it is crucial . The City boss says if his team can get through the group they still have a chance of winning the competition . ‘After that, here against Roma we didn’t play well and Roma were in a very good moment. And in Russia I think we played very well but with an excess of trust we couldn’t win but we are planning to arrange that and I hope we will do it. ‘Last year we were the club that qualified with the biggest amount of points every time with 15 points. What happened this year in the three games of the Champions League, we have time to arrange it and I am sure we are going to arrange it. ‘It is impossible to be sure but I think this group will be decided in the last game in Italy against Roma. We will see what happens, we are going to try to win our two games at home and see what the other teams do but I am sure this will be decided in the last game.’ ‘I think it is a very important game but it is not a (sudden) death game because until mathematics can’t fix it, you can continue. We must win this game because we have just two points and we have three games to play and it is very important to have more points. We will consider it not a final game but a very important game.’ Manchester City have just two points from their first three games, and will need to improve to qualify .

"Yugoslavian Jasna Badzak duped a UKIP Euro MP out of £3,000 to go on a shopping spree after disapproving of his policies . A former press secretary duped a UKIP Euro MP out of £3,000 to go on a shopping spree after disapproving of his policies. Yugoslavian Jasna Badzak, 42, who worked as a self-employed researcher for MEP Gerard Batten, claimed she had not received £2,500 in fees from the European Parliament. Badzak told Mr Batten that she was too poor to travel to work, having forged online bank statements to suggest the payment had not been made. But records showed she had embarked on spending sprees in Gucci and Harrods, Southwark Crown Court heard. She was today spared jail to avoid ‘wrecking her son’s life’. Badzak, whose relatives died in Nazi concentration camps, said her relationship with the politician deteriorated after she was asked to work on a policy document entitled ‘dismantling multiculturalism’ in February 2011. The divorced mother-of-one complained to UKIP leader, Nigel Farage, who she claims gave Mr Batten a ‘dressing down’. Mr Batten responded by ordering her never to contact Mr Farage again, Badzak told the court. The politician, who is also the UKIP MEPs Chief Whip, insisted he was not aware Badzak was unhappy at work. He loaned her the apparently outstanding wages, together with a separate £500, thinking she would repay him once after receiving the cash from the European Parliament. But Badzak only offered to reimburse Mr Batten after police began an investigation and has yet to pay a penny back to the MEP. Judge Michael Gledhill QC told Badzak that she would have been jailed for a year had she not been the sole carer for her 15-year-old son, who is studying his GCSEs. Instead, he suspended her 12-month month prison sentence for two years to ‘avoid wrecking her son’s life’. Sentencing, Judge Gledhill told her: ‘In November 2011 you were taken on by Gerard Batten on a three-month contract and you were to be paid by the European Parliament. ‘You knew there would be a delay in payments and you were not to be paid until January. In fact, the European Parliament paid people earlier than expected in December. ‘You doctored your online bank statement with your NatWest account by removing the £2,500 payment so someone looking at the statement would think it had not been paid. ‘That was flagrant dishonesty. ‘In due course Mr Batten was good enough to give you another three-month contract and you threw that back in his face by continuing the lie. ‘By the end of the period he realised you were not working together as satisfactorily as he had hoped when he decided not to issue another three-month contract. ‘What did you do? You then took him to an employment tribunal and lost those proceedings. ‘You reported him to the police for fraud, who investigated and took no further action. You issued high court proceedings against him as well. ‘You did that to deflect attention from your own dishonesty by mounting a wholesale attack on his character. ‘He said he felt he was on trial and that was your doing. ‘I am going to suspend the sentence only because of your son. He is perfectly innocent of any wrongdoing and I’m not going to wreck his life by sending his mother to prison. Badzak, whose relatives died in Nazi concentration camps, said her relationship with the politician deteriorated after she was asked to work on a policy document entitled ¿dismantling multiculturalism¿ in February 2011 . ‘If that were not the case you would be going to prison for 12 months. ‘Members of parliament are vulnerable to people such as yourself who are bent on vengeance.’ To ‘bring home the seriousness’ of Badzak’s crimes, Judge Gledhill also ordered she will be subject to a four-month curfew between 8pm and 6am. She must also pay £500 in court costs. Badzak showed no emotion as the sentence was passed. Badzak - a former Tory general election candidate who fled war-torn Yugoslavia 20 years ago - claimed Mr Batten was exposed meeting deputy leader of far-right group, English Defence League, on numerous occasions by anti-fascism magazine, Searchlight. Gerard Batten, who is also the UKIP MEPs Chief Whip, insisted he was not aware Badzak was unhappy at work . She also told in evidence how the MEP gleefully ‘jumped around the office’ when he was interviewed by reporters about the battle to extradite Wikileaks founder, Julian Assange. He was ‘over the moon’ to be quoted in stories about the controversial Swede, who is remains holed up at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, and insisted the UKIP website should be informed of his ‘success’ she claimed. Mr Batten enjoyed a string of interviews with journalists including John Pilger, as well as airtime on CNN, NBC and French TV. ‘He was over the moon, he couldn’t stop talking about it’, Badzak told jurors. Badzak was arrested in November 2011, just months after she lost a case against Mr Batten at an employment tribunal, which is pending an appeal. She insisted she did not forge any bank statements to indicate the payments had not been received and denied telling the politician she was in ‘financial straits’. Despite having an MBA qualification, she claimed she was ‘absolutely useless’ with money and ‘never knew what was in her bank account.’ Arlette Piercy, defending Badzak, told the court that she suffered from significant health problems including depression, which had been exacerbated as a result of the proceedings. The only thing Mr Batten did not accept was the contact between him and members of the EDL, Ms Piercy said. She added: ‘At the end of the day, there is not a great disagreement between the defence and prosecution witness as to what the parameters of the agenda were.’ Badzak, of Kilburn, northwest London, denied forgery and fraud but was convicted by a jury.","Yugoslavian Jasna Badzak, 42, worked as a researcher for Gerard Batten .

"She has lived through six different monarchs, outlived two of her owners and even survived the Blitz. At 116 years old, Tommy the tortoise could be Britain's oldest pet. The female Hermann's tortoise was aged 11 when she was bought for £1 from a London market by Margaret Cloonan in 1909. Ageing: At 116 years old, Tommy the tortoise (pictured with her owner Sheila Floris) could be Britain's oldest pet . Since then, she has been passed down . through three generations of the same family and has seen over a century of milestones, including two world . wars, the sinking of the Titanic and the Millennium. Now, the ageing reptile lives with Ms Cloonan's granddaughter, Sheila Floris, 57, and her husband, Carlo, at their home in Croydon, south London. And despite never having been to a vet in her entire life, she still appears to be in perfect health. 'Tommy is a much loved member of the family and it’s amazing that my mother grew up with her, as did I and my children now,' said Mrs Floris. Old: The female Hermann's tortoise was aged 11 when she was bought for £1 from a London market in 1909 . Bringing joy to generations: Tommy is pictured with Mrs Floris's father and daughter Vitalia, now 25, in 1989 . 'I remember loving Tommy from a young age, she was an interesting pet to have. Tommy and I have a great bond - she will even poke her head out of her shell when I call her name. 'It is just like having a dog or a cat for a pet, but with much less maintenance. Tommy is happiest in the garden, and nestling under in the bushes. She also likes a sprinkle of water on her shell in the summer, when it gets hot.' She added: 'My . mum never took Tommy to a vet and she was fine. So when I inherited her . I asked lots of people whether I should get her checked out but we . decided not to tempt fate, as she has been fine up until this point. Beloved: Tommy has been passed down through three generations of the same family and has seen over a century of milestones, including two world wars and the sinking of the Titanic. Above, Tommy and Mrs Floris . At home: Now, she lives with Mrs Floris, 57, and her husband, Carlo, at their home in Croydon, south London . 'She would probably die of shock on the vet’s table- so we are just going to leave her be.' Tommy lives in Mrs Floris's garden, and has a specific spot under the hedge where she likes to stay. During the day, she is allowed to roam loose in the garden, munching on grass and dandelions. And despite hibernating in the ground for six months of the year, she always wakes up on either one of two days every year - April 1st which was Mrs Floris's mother's . birthday, or Mother’s Day. Healthy: Despite never having been to a vet in her entire life, Tommy still appears to be in perfect health . 'It’s really spooky- it’s as if mum is there waking Tommy up. It’s always one of those two days, every year,' said Mrs Floris. 'A . tortoise was a very exotic pet to have back in the 1900s, but not many . survived. Owners would put their tortoise in a box for hibernation and . forget about them. 'Luckily, my mother was very careful with Tommy, and it’s amazing how she is still going strong.' Tommy, who is of the endangered Hermann's species, was given her name by Mrs Cloonan who believed she was male. Mrs Floris said the family was shocked when they discovered her true sex after she began to lay eggs. 'Due to her age the eggs were empty but we were amazed because we . had always thought Tommy was a boy!' she said. 'The name had stuck for so long, . there was no way we could change it - so she is the ultimate tomboy.' And it is not just the Floris family who love Tommy - their pet cat, Jet, has also formed an unlikely bond with the ageing reptile. 'Jet and Tommy are best friends,' said Mrs Floris. 'Jet will guard Tommy all day and make sure no animals attack her. It is heart-warming to see.' “I don’t worry about Tommy, despite her age, because I know she is being looked after by Jet. It is such a sweet pairing.” Tommy has outlived her two previous owners, Mrs Floris's mother and grandmother, and her owner believes she may have another 70 years left in her yet. Best friends: The Floris family's pet cat Jet (pictured) has also formed an unlikely bond with the ageing reptile . Mrs Floris, who has two children, Vitalia, 25 and Damien, 23, said: 'I’ve already said to my daughter that if Tommy outlives me, she is to take on responsibility for her. She is a very dear member of our family and the most precious family heirloom.' 'She has had a rich and full time, and lived through many changes along the way. Because we have grown up together it’s so nice that she likes a pat now and again and will let me feed her by hand. 'She really is the best pet I could ask for.'","Aged 116, Tommy the tortoise has lived through six different monarchs .

"A large column of Russian tanks, heavy weapons and combat troops entered eastern Ukraine earlier this week, NATO's top commander claimed today, prompting fears of an re-escalation in the seven month old conflict. U.S. General Philip Breedlove said his officials witnessed the force cross over the 'completely wide-open' border between the countries at some point in the last two days. The Russian Defense Ministry quickly rejected Breedlove's statement as groundless and continues to deny that its troops have entered eastern Ukraine to help pro-Russian separatists fighting against forces loyal to the Kiev-based government. The news comes the U.N. Security Council held an emergency session on Ukraine amid worries about a renewal of the full-scale conflict in the rebel-held east. Scroll down for video . Force: An armored personnel carrier belonging to pro-Russian separatists travels on a main road through rebel-territory near the east Ukrainian village of Torez this morning . Speaking in the Bulgarian capital Sofia, General Breedlove said: 'We have seen columns of Russian equipment, primarily Russian tanks, Russian artillery, Russian air defense systems and Russian combat troops entering into Ukraine.' He wouldn't say how many fresh troops and weapons have moved into Ukraine and wouldn't specify how the alliance obtained the information, but added that the force was spotted in the last two days. The Russian Defense Ministry quickly rejected Breedlove's statement as groundless. The West and Ukraine have continuously accused Moscow of fueling a pro-Russian insurgency in eastern Ukraine with troops and weapons - the claims Russia has rejected. Claims: U.S. General Philip Breedlove (pictured left in Sofia with Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov today) said his officials witnessed the force cross the 'completely wide-open' border in the last two days . A column of tanks drive from a rebel-territory to Donetsk near the town of Shakhtarsk in eastern Ukraine . The news comes as UN officials with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe called an emergency session on Ukraine amid concerns of a re-escalation of fighting. The main city in the eastern Ukraine, Donetsk, has seen its heaviest shelling in recent weeks despite a cease-fire signed two months ago between Ukraine and Russia-backed separatists. The cease-fire called on September 5 has been violated almost daily. The Security Council has met well over a dozen times on Ukraine since the crisis began early this year, but little action can be taken as permanent member Russia has veto power. Military: Pro-Russian gunmen patrol the centre of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine earlier this morning . This morning heavy artillery fire rocked Donetsk - the rebel-held industrial city that represents a de facto capital for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. It was unclear whether the fire came from the government forces besieging the city, or from rebel resistance troops. There were also reports of heavy clashes in the outskirts of the rebel-held city of Luhansk, where separatists fired on a government posititon near the village of Schastya. More than 4,000 people have died since government forces moved in April to put down an armed insurrection by the rebels in the two regions, which border Russia. Kiev says it is redeploying forces in eastern Ukraine to prepare for a possible new rebel offensive.","General Philip Breedlove said NATO officials saw force crossing border .

"When the worst floods in a generation hit the banks of the Thames in January, most people got out their mops and buckets. However, Yaron Ivry had a more ambitious idea. The 58-year-old and his family live on an island between the River Thames and an artificial water channel, which means they are vulnerable to flooding, and they, too, suffered the heartbreak of their home being inundated. And so, determined not to go through the agonising misery and financial expense again, the telecoms consultant decided to raise his five-bedroom house 4½ft up in the air — and fill in the resulting gap with breeze blocks. Scroll down for video . Gently does it: Yaron Ivry with his five bedroom house in Wraysbury, Berkshire, which has been jacked up to avoid the frequent floods which have plagued his area . Over the course of just ten days, the 80-ton building, having been placed on a steel cradle, was raised by 28 computerised jacks, moving upwards at three inches an hour. Now, after three months, the job is almost complete. The lifting has been finished, but the front and back doors are still suspended nearly 5ft up in mid-air — accessible only by climbing a pile of teetering breeze blocks. And the old ground floor of the house in Wraysbury, Berkshire, is a newly created basement. Today, Yaron, a dynamo of a man, is busy overseeing every last detail of his grand dream. It’s a family affair as his son Ben, a medical student on his summer holiday, carts building materials around the site in a wheelbarrow. By the end of next month, the house will be as good as new, except for the insertion of a huge floodable basement on which the house will rest. And it will enjoy even more dramatic views across the Thames to Runnymede, where Magna Carta was signed in 1215. Not only will the house be safe from future floods, the family will have benefited financially. Before the flood, which caused £125,000 in damage, the house was worth £1 million. After the flood, though, its value had, understandably, dropped to £750,000. Now, after the Ivrys spent £70,000 on the lifting project, it’s worth between £1.5 million and £2 million. Such a turnaround seemed a near impossibility just a few months ago. When the flood waters arrived, the family’s ground floor was wrecked — the hardwood floor, walls and electrics all damaged beyond repair. ‘After the flood, we had to think of a way to protect the property,’ says Mr Ivry, who has lived in the house with his wife and two sons for 15 years. Being self-employed, he was unable to work after the floods hit. ‘It’s taken months of my life, plus all the cost of renovation, so I made a decision that we couldn’t allow it to happen again.’ Danger: The five-bedroom home is at great risk of flooding due to its position on an island of desirable properties between the River Thames and a water channel . First, he considered sealing the house with a barrier fitted all around with waterproof doors and powerful pumps that would get rid of any ground water and leakage. ‘But then I realised that wouldn’t be enough,’ he says. ‘Water will find its way in through the tiniest crack. And all you need is one leak.’ Mr Ivry then considered a demolition and rebuild job, but it would have cost £500,000. And so he devised a radical plan: to lift the house in one great piece above the flood area altogether, for a fraction of the price. Planning permission was surprisingly easy to get. At first, Mr Ivry sought only to raise the house by 3ft — but the Environment Agency objected, saying it should be raised by 4½ft to be sure of avoiding flood damage. Council officials were sympathetic, too. As for the neighbours, they have been supportive and full of admiration because they might now follow this example. And so specialist builders — more used to lifting 6,000-ton bridges than family homes — set to work. First, a cat’s cradle of steel beams was created underneath the house. This web of metal — 250 beams altogether and weighing 14 tons — would bear the weight of the house when it began to move. Beams were erected within the building, just under the concrete ground floor (the carpet and floorboards had been destroyed by water and had already been ripped out). Through holes punched in the brick walls, the beams within connected to more beams ringing the house’s exterior — a design that stabilised the metal framework. Grand plans: The family has spent three months and £70,000 lifting the 80-ton building away from harm using 28 super-strong jacks, each capable of supporting 50 tons . Then, 28 super-strong jacks — each capable of supporting 50 tons — were placed underneath the steel cradle. A diamond-edged saw then sliced horizontally through all the brick walls below the level of the concrete floors, severing the building from its foundations. The idea was that, with the perimeter ring of steel steadying the structure and pressure spread evenly over the jacks, no one part of the building would be exposed to particular stress as it was raised. If all went to plan, this would keep it in one piece. Finally, all the windows and walls were braced with timber beams to help ease any internal strains. So now the house was ready to be lifted heavenwards. But putting engineering theory into practice was a nerve-racking experience. With each click of the hydraulic jacks, the building started to move up by millimetres, as the Ivrys (who are living in rented accommodation while the project is completed) looked on. The family’s possessions remained inside the house. Slowly and silently, their home climbed into the air — but dramatically enough that you could see the tiny little jumps it made with each click of the jacks. ‘I was terrified,’ says Mrs Ivry. ‘It wasn’t just the house we were lifting, but everything we had inside. It moved very slowly and quietly — just like the flood.’ As the jacks pushed the house higher, they were wrapped in metal reinforcement jackets of increasing height to help to support the weight. And as those jacks clicked away — raising the house a few inches every hour — computers tracked how high they were climbing. Innovation: The new breeze block basement will be wrapped in bricks and partly concealed by decking as it cannot be used for residential purposes . ‘It was crucial that all the jacks raised the house at the same rate,’ says Mr Ivry. ‘Just a 10mm discrepancy between one side of the house and the other would have meant the whole thing would have cracked, causing irreparable structural damage.’ Once the house had been raised the full 4½ feet, this house on stilts resembled something more likely to be seen in the hurricane vulnerable areas of America’s Gulf Coast, where such solutions are commonplace. Over the past week, however, the newly formed gap at the bottom of this Berkshire house has been filled with breeze blocks. The spaces in the brickwork, where the steel beams poke out, will soon be filled with a dry mix of sand and cement. Once this has set, the jacks will be removed and the steel cradle will be dismantled and taken away. The new breeze block basement will be wrapped in bricks and part concealed by decking on the house’s riverside front. Under Environment Agency rules, the new basement cannot be used for residential purposes. Mr Ivry jokes that he will store a Ferrari there but, in fact, it will have to be left empty. Thinking back to the start of the project, Mr Ivry says: ‘It was very sad. It didn’t feel like a home any more, and it was terrible taking it all apart. What was a family home had become a project. But it will become a family home again.’ His wife agrees. ‘It makes sense,’ she says. ‘It’s easy to forget how terrible the flooding was. My husband was very stressed. The flooding was so bad that some of our neighbours never returned to their homes.’ Taking action: Some of their neighbours never returned home after the floods, the worst of which came in January and sent the cost of home insurance sky high . Building plots nearby have become worthless. Insurance firms won’t cover new houses in the area. Mr Ivry received £125,000 in compensation for the flood damage very quickly — but could see that he would have difficulty getting a new policy. ‘I was very happy with the insurers,’ he says. ‘But they wouldn’t insure me once my policy runs out, and I can see why. At the moment, my insurance is £50 or £60 a month. After the floods, it would be £10,000 a year.’ And so what will happen to houses on flood plains across the country if, as some are predicting, flooding gets worse in years to come? Some houses will be abandoned by those who can’t afford the higher insurance premiums. Other owners, after the Ivrys’ example, will surely consider lifting their homes towards the clouds. ‘If my idea spreads, then many other houses will be saved,’ says Mr Ivry, the man who took on the forces of nature — and won.","Yaron Ivry and his family live in five-bedroom home on a island between water channels in Wraysbury, Berkshire .

"As many as a quarter of a million Twitter users may have had their personal details stolen by hackers, after the social media giant became the latest victim in a string of high-profile cyber attacks. Twitter, which has over 200 million active users worldwide, admitted in a blog posting earlier this week it had detected attempts to gain access to its user data. While the site shut down one attack moments after it was detected, it discovered the 'extremely sophisticated' hackers may have managed to access user names, e-mail addresses and encrypted passwords belonging to 250,000 users. Hacked: Twitter said Friday that it had become the latest victim in a number of high-profile cyber-attacks against media companies, saying that hackers may have gained access to information on 250,000 of its more than 200 million active users . Twitter reset the pilfered passwords and has said all affected users would receive an e-mail notifying them that they need to create a new password. Twitter is not the only media company frantically reassessing its information security; U.S. firms including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post have also fallen victim to hackers. The American publications say their computer systems were targeted by hackers in China. The New York Times revealed its computer systems were infiltrated over a period of four months, during which time its reporters were investigating the huge fortune of Chinese premier Wen Jibao. The newspaper believes the hackers were trying to monitor its coverage of the premier - a claim denied by the Chinese government. Meanwhile the Wall Street Journal announced it had carried out a complete overhaul of its systems after discovering it too had been the target of China-based cyber attacks. It said the hackers who breached its system were also trying to gain information about reporting activity and sources being used for the publication's China coverage. Yesterday the Washington Post revealed it had brought in consultants from the National Security Agency and the Defense Department after hackers targeted three servers and numerous desktops for more than half of last year. It also alleges Chinese hackers were behind the prolonged breach. The network was awash with tweets about the cyber attack today as the extent of the security breach came to light. One user, under the handle @BacardiKid, posted: 'If there are strange things going on with your account it's because Twitter has been hacked - big time!' The online attack comes on the heels of recent hacks into the computer systems of U.S. media and technology companies, including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. Both American newspapers reported this week that their computer systems had been infiltrated by China-based hackers, likely to monitor media coverage the Chinese government deems important. Bob Lord, Twitter's director of information security, said the breach was the work of 'extremely sophisticated' attackers. 'This attack was not the work of amateurs, and we do not believe it was an isolated incident... and we believe other companies and organisations have also been recently similarly attacked,' he said in a blog post. ‘For that reason we felt that it was . important to publicize this attack while we still gather information, . and we are helping government and federal law enforcement in their . effort to find and prosecute these attackers to make the Internet safer . for all users,' Mr Lord added. China has been accused of mounting a widespread, aggressive cyber-spying campaign for several years, trying to steal classified information and corporate secrets and to intimidate critics. The Chinese foreign ministry could not be reached for comment Saturday, but the Chinese government has said those accusations are baseless and that China itself is a victim of cyber-attacks. ‘Chinese law forbids hacking and any other actions that damage Internet security,’ the Chinese Defense Ministry recently said. ‘The Chinese military has never supported any hacking activities.’ Professional job: Twitter said in its blog that the attack 'was not the work of amateurs, and we do not believe it was an isolated incident.' (Twitter's CEO Twitter Dick Costolo pictured) Gauging the damage: Twitter is generally used to broadcast messages to the public, so the hacking might not immediately have yielded any important secrets . One expert said that the Twitter hack probably happened after an employee's home or work computer was compromised through vulnerabilities in Java, a commonly used computing language whose weaknesses have been well publicized. Ashkan Soltani, an independent privacy and security researcher, said such a move would give attackers ‘a toehold’ in Twitter's internal network, potentially allowing them either to sniff out user information as it traveled across the company's system or break into specific areas, such as the authentication servers that process users' passwords. In a telephone interview on Friday, Soltani said that the relatively small number of users affected suggested either that attackers weren't on the network long or that they were only able to compromise a subset of the company's servers. Twitter is generally used to broadcast messages to the public, so the hacking might not immediately have yielded any important secrets. But the stolen credentials could be used to eavesdrop on private messages or track which Internet address a user is posting from. That might be useful, for example, for an authoritarian regime trying to keep tabs on a journalist's movements. ‘More realistically, someone could use that as an entry point into another service,’ Soltani said, noting that since few people bother using different passwords for different services, a password stolen from Twitter might be just as handy for reading a journalist's emails. Sophisticated hackers: 'The attackers were extremely sophisticated, and we believe other companies and organizations have also been recently similarly attacked,' Twitter's blog read .","Social media giant detected attempts to gain access to users' details .

"The chairman of Laxey Partners has urged the wider Rangers support to take on Mike Ashley – after his firm sold its 16 per cent stake in the club to three wealthy businessman. The Isle of Man investment firm’s chief Colin Kingsnorth confirmed he had completed a deal with Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor in order to halt Ashley’s Ibrox takeover. He also accused chairman David Somers of being a ‘wet fish’ and admitted his disillusionment with the ruling Ibrox regime after Norman Crighton, Laxey’s man on the board, decided to quit earlier this month. Mike Ashley's plans to take further control at Rangers have been stymied by SFA rules on dual interest . The decision to sell 13.3million shares to the men dubbed the Three Bears is widely seen as an attack on the Ashley’s iron grip of Rangers. Kingsnorth believes the billionaire Sports Direct tycoon can only be stopped from inside the Ibrox boardroom. ‘I sold because a fans-based group were hopefully going to be the best placed to take on Ashley’s power,’ Kingsnorth stated. ‘After Ashley removed Norman Crighton, Ashley’s most vocal critic, it was obvious David Somers was just a wet fish agreeing anything Ashley wanted. ‘I am sure the Three Bears are an upgrade on us for fans and hopefully this is the start of the ownership being in the right hands.’ Sportsmail understands that club legends Walter Smith and Ally McCoist – who hold a combined stake of around two per cent - and a myriad of fans with 10 per cent are firmly behind the Three Bears’ move. Sandy Easdale (left), pictured at Easter Road on December 27, has offered a cautious welcome to investment . A day of high drama in the Ibrox power game took a dramatic twist shortly after trading began on Wednesday morning when the three wealthy supporters snapped up 16 per cent of the club. The £2.6m deal sees Park, Letham and Taylor become the biggest single shareholders in the club with close to 20 per cent of the equity. A stock market announcement has yet to confirm the precise identity of the buyers and sellers with official notification unlikely before Friday. But sources claim bus tycoon Park, Letham and Taylor are the purchasers after they announced plans for a £6.5m investment last week. Last week the three offered to buy up all the new stock issued in a pending fresh share issue. Existing shareholders will be given first refusal – and by purchasing Laxey’s stake the three will now be guaranteed a chance to up their stake when new shares are sold. The development has all the hallmarks of a game-changer in the battle for control of the Ibrox boardroom. Although Wednesday's purchase does not automatically mean boardroom representation for the three, significantly they are now in a position to call an EGM. If enough support can be gathered from other factions, potentially they could now seek the removal and appointment of directors. The development will be seen a threat to the grip Ashley and the Easdale brothers presently have on the club. Although Sandy Easdale stated on Tuesday that he would be open for talks with the Three Bears, the chairman of the football board was believed to be referring to an investment as opposed to the kind of power grab witnessed on Wednesday. City sources have pointed out that that the proceeds of Wednesday's share sales will go to Laxey rather than the football club. Newcastle owner Ashley’s plans to up his stake in the club to 29.9 per cent have been stymied by SFA rules on dual interest. Last week the SFA Board, having met with Rangers chief executive Derek Llambias, flatly refused to accede to a request to allow Ashley to further increase his stake from nine per cent. Rangers fans have protested outside Ibrox on numerous occasions at the running of their football club . Ashley and Rangers have already been charged by the governing body due to perceived breaches of an agreement on boardroom control, and although the Londoner would be entitled to ensure his existing stake isn’t diluted in the new rights issue, exceeding that percentage would guarantee another clash with officialdom. That situation has opened the door for Park, Letham and Taylor who could now buy circa 20 per cent of the new issue – as well as any unsold shares – to strengthen their position in the coming weeks. A spokesman for the consortium said they had no comment to make on Wednesday night. But their move saw fans ownership group Rangers First witness a surge in membership after news of a shift to the Ibrox powerbase emerged. Over 200 fans moved on Wednesday morning to pledge financial support for the group’ s aims of giving supporters a say in the club’s running via the purchase of shares. Hearts and Hibernian have already moved towards a supporter led model. Encouraged by the emergence of the wealthy Rangers supporters, Rangers First now hope to hold discussions with the group. Ronnie Johnston of Rangers First told Sportsmail: ‘We have had an unprecedented surge in membership this morning. ‘We have gone from 1900 members on Monday to 2100 in one day. The surge created by a little bit of positive news tells me that a lot of people thought fan ownership was something that could only be triggered by crisis. Ibrox has not seen Premiership football for a number of years as Rangers attempt to climb the leagues . ‘That may have been what happened at Hearts and Hibs. But it looks like a bit of good news can bring the fans to the table as well. ‘Our strategy is now to wait and see what happens. To see who is the big shareholder and then use our members’ permission to engage with that group. ‘It will be good to see who has bought these shares and have a conversation. ‘Tom Farmer would appear to have cut a deal with Hibs supporters and whoever this is it could be that there is an opportunity now for Rangers supporters to do something similar. ‘There has been division amongst the Rangers support up until now. But I think the division has been created by the unknown and by fear. ‘For Rangers fans this could be the moment when they say that if Letham, Taylor and Park have broken the back of the problem then they will put their shoulder to the wheel too. I hope that is the case. ‘It’s an important day for Rangers on the 44th anniversary of the Ibrox disaster now. ‘I hope the fans come out now and demonstrate their passion and care for the club by sending out a powerful message.’ The news of the Three Bears’ investment was welcomed by the club’s football board chairman Sandy Easdale and his brother, PLC director James. Their spokesman Jack Irvine said: ‘If the reports are accurate, Sandy and James are delighted that Mr Park and his friends have bought the Laxey shares and they hope they will further invest in the club. ‘As we said yesterday the Easdales and Messrs Park, Taylor and Letham have a common goal - the re-emergence of Rangers as a footballing power.’","Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor have paid £2.6million for three blocks of shares totalling 13.3million .

"Suspect: Li Xiaolon, 27, who worked at the hospital has been arrested by police and is said to have a history of mental illness . A janitor with a history of mental illness stabbed seven people to death at the hospital he worked at in northern China today. Six nurses and one hospital administrator were among those murdered - with another nurse seriously injured in the rampage, the official Xinhua news agency said. It is the latest in a string of shocking attacks on medical workers in the last two years - with the health ministry only recently introducing measures to step up security at hospitals. The tragedy unfolded at 3.30am in the staff quarters of the People’s Liberation Army 281 Hospital in Beidaihe district, Qinhuangdao city - a military sanatorium in the northern province of Hebei. The district of Beidaihe is 185 miles from Beijing and is highly popular with senior members of the ruling Communist party and was once a favourite of Mao Zedong's. Police arrested a 27-year-old man  named locally as Li Xiaolon who worked in the institution's canteen. After the rampage Li returned to his dorm rather than escaping, the Southern Metropolis News reported. Neighbours in Li's hometown in Xiaoheituo village described him as an 'introvert' who did not 'get along with the crowd'. The Beijing News said Li had made statements about having a history of mental illness and had received treatment in Beijing and the nearby city of Tangshan in 2006. 'It is initially understood that the suspect did not have any obvious problems with the deceased,' the newspaper said on its website. Officials said Li had been working away from home for the past six years and returned occasionally to see his parents who are in their 50s and lead humble lifestyles as peasants. The case is being handled by Beidaiheo public security bureau. Deputy provincial police chief and deputy mayor, Yang Chunguang, is leading the investigation. The hospital is under the management of Beijing Military Command. Rampage: The tragedy unfolded in the staff quarters of the People’s Liberation Army 281 Hospital in Beidaihe district, Qinhuangdao city, a military sanatorium in the northern province of Hebei . Chinese police officials have increased security at hospitals after a spate of attacks and reportedly begun arming their workers with pepper spray earlier this year. While the Chinese government has ramped up health spending, hospitals are frequently overwhelmed with patients. Doctors are also badly paid, leading to corruption and a suspicion that staff are more interested in making money by prescribing unnecessary drugs and treatment than tending the sick. It is the latest in a string of shocking attacks on medical workers in the last two years . Many other Chinese people are unable to afford health care despite government efforts to provide a basic safety net, which has also prompted attacks in the past. Ministry data shows that violent attacks directed at doctors and other health care workers in the form of beatings, threats, kidnappings, verbal abuse and murder reached 17,243 cases in 2010, the latest year for which such figures are available. China has also seen a spate in knife attacks on children in recent months. In October, an eight-year-old boy was stabbed to death and two classmates seriously injured in the eastern province of Jiangxi as they walked home from school. The town of Beidaihe is located around 185 miles from Beijing and is favoured by senior members of China's ruling Communist party . In September, four children were killed by a man while on their way to school in China's southern Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region. Another knife attack that same month saw three children killed and six people injured in a knife attack at a school in the central Hubei province. And in December 2012 twenty-two children were injured by a knife-wielding man at a primary school in central China. Min Yingjun, 36, stabbed an elderly woman before bursting into Chenpeng Village Primary School in the Henan province yesterday. Seven of the students, aged between six and 12 years old, were taken to hospital, some with severed fingers and ears.","Shocking rampage took place at military hospital in Beidaihe, north China .

"Spike Lee went on a long-winded rant against gentrification in New York City on Tuesday night when he was asked to argue against the development of poorer neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Harlem. The director, who has focused on racial issues and gentrification in his films, blasted an audience member at the Pratt Institute who started defending the changes in the neighborhoods. 'Let me just kill you right now,' Lee said to the unidentified questioner. 'Have you seen Fort Greene Park in the morning? It’s like the mother*****’ Westminster Dog Show,' he said drawing a comparison to the high-brow competition that would seem out of place in the harder-edged streets of Brooklyn where he grew up. His soapbox: Spike Lee argued that New York City is being gentrified at an alarming rate and it is no longer the same city that he grew up in . Lee pointed the finger at white New Yorkers who have moved into historically black neighborhoods and changed the environment, arguing that those changes have caused the areas to evolve into something completely different. 'Here’s the thing: I grew up here in Fort Greene. I grew up here in New York. It’s changed. And why does it take an influx of white New Yorkers in the south Bronx, in Harlem, in Bed Stuy, in Crown Heights for the facilities to get better?' he said. 'The garbage wasn’t picked up every mother*****’ day when I was living in 165 Washington Park. P.S. 20 was not good. P.S. 11. Rothschild 294. The police weren’t around. 'When you see white mothers pushing their babies in strollers, three o’clock in the morning on 125th Street, that must tell you something.' Protecting a legacy: Lee complained that residents in Brooklyn and Harlem are now stopping events in public parks for fear of excessive noise of garbage . 'Crystal ball': Lee said that a scene in his 1989 hit Do The Right Thing foreshadowed gentrification problems to come in Harlem . The entire 10-minute exchange was transcribed by New York Magazine, and it was clear that he knew it would cause a firestorm. 'My father’s a great jazz musician. He bought a house in nineteen-motherf*****’-sixty-eight, and the motherf*****' people moved in last year and called the cops on my father. He’s not — he doesn’t even play electric bass! It’s acoustic! We bought the motherf*****’ house in nineteen-sixty-motherf*****’-eight and now you call the cops? In 2013? Get the f*** outta here!' 'You can’t just come in the neighborhood and start bogarting and say, like you’re motherf*****’ Columbus and kill off the Native Americans. Or what they do in Brazil, what they did to the indigenous people. You have to come with respect. There’s a code. There’s people.' 'I’m for democracy and letting everybody live but you gotta have some respect. You can’t just come in when people have a culture that’s been laid down for generations and you come in and now s*** gotta change because you’re here? Get the f*** outta here. Can’t do that!' 'The black American population in New York City is going down because of... reverse migration and what we have and - and its something that de Blasio's going to, I mean he can't get the snow off the ground but still- what we need is affordable housing for everybody.' In spite of his outrage, Lee has moved to a cleaner, less noisy . area himself as he has lived in the Upper East Side since 2000. He . keeps connected to his Brooklyn roots by basing his company's . headquarters in Fort Greene, however. The topic was raised when a male audience member asked about a recent New York Times article that extolled the benefits of gentrification. This was not the paper's first recent foray into the issue, as a series they ran about homelessness in the city pointed out that some of the worst-run shelters is located next to brownstone houses that now sell for multiple millions. Lee said that gentrification is shown by more than just a heavier police presence on the streets but also by the dismissal of cultural customs. 'Then comes the mother*****’ Christopher Columbus Syndrome. You can’t discover this! We been here. You just can’t come and bogart. 'There were brothers playing mother*****’ African drums in Mount Morris Park for 40 years and now they can’t do it anymore because the new inhabitants said the drums are loud.' He boasted that his . critically-acclaimed film Do The Right Thing, which was released in . 1989, predicted the gentrification debate like a 'crystal ball', citing a . scene where a white man in Harlem is berated by his black neighbor . after the man accidentally scuffs up his new Air Jordan sneakers. Lee . told a story about how a party in Fort Greene park was proposed in . honor of Michael Jackson when the singer died but the plan got nixed . after residents complained that there would be too much garbage. Changing scene: Lee said that Fort Greene Park is cleaner than it has ever been . 'Garbage? Have you seen Fort Greene Park in the morning? It’s like the mother*****’ Westminster Dog Show. There’s 20,000 dogs running around. Whoa. So we had to move it to Prospect Park!' Lee said. 'I mean, they just move in the neighborhood. You just can’t come in the neighborhood. I’m for democracy and letting everybody live but you gotta have some respect. 'You can’t just come in when people have a culture that’s been laid down for generations and you come in and now s*** gotta change because you’re here? Get the fuck outta here. Can’t do that!'","The Brooklyn-raised director launched into an argument about the drawbacks of gentrification .

"Iraqi soldiers battling ISIS militants have recaptured most of the town of Beiji, home to the country's largest oil refinery. The strategic town, which is situated 155 miles north of Baghdad, is now likely to become the base for a future push to take back Saddam Hussein's hometown. There was no word on the fate of the refinery, which lies on Beiji's northern outskirts, today but the advances in the town could help break the five-month siege of the facility by Islamic State fighters. Iraqi soldiers battling ISIS have recaptured most of the town of Beiji, home to the country's largest oil refinery which has been under attack by militants for more than five months. Pictured: Smoke rises from the facility . Since June, a small army unit inside the refinery has successfully resisted wave after wave of extremist assaults. Lifting the siege of the refinery, which sits inside a sprawling complex, was said to be the next objective in the campaign to rid Beiji of the militants, according to military officials  in the town. However, hours after news of the recapturing of Beiji broke, a suicide bomber rammed his explosives-laden car into a military outpost in the Tarmiyah district north of Baghdad, killing seven soldiers and wounding 13 others. Those killed included the post's commander, a major, two other officers, a captain and a lieutenant, police said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, but it bore the hallmarks of the militant Sunnis of the Islamic State group. Elsewhere, nine people were killed and 24 injured in three separate blasts in and around Baghdad. State television has today quoted the top army commander in Beiji, Gen. Abdul-Wahab al-Saadi, as saying troops also recaptured Beiji's local government and police headquarters at the centre of the town. It aired footage of army tanks and armored personnel carriers moving around the town's dusty streets and a ball of white smoke rising in the background. Al-Saadi later spoke to state television by telephone but the line appeared to be cut off after he said his forces were meeting stiff resistance. Three military officials later said the advancing army troops and Shiite militiamen are being slowed down by booby-trapped houses and ambushes. Iraqi military forces (pictured in Jurf al-Sakher town, south of Baghdad earlier this week) have reclaimed Beiji . Raed Ibrahim, the governor of Salahuddin province, where both Beiji and Tikrit are located, said the military had secured about 75 per cent of the town, retaking the centre of the town and outlying districts. He said government forces continued to meet fierce resistance from the militants, whom he said were using suicide bombers to stall the military's advance. Neither the military officials nor Ibrahim gave casualty figures for the government forces or the militants. The officials, however, said the forces had blocked access to Beiji from Anbar province, where militants control vast swaths of land, prior to their assault on the town to prevent militant reinforcements from reaching the city. Government officials in Baghdad offered no immediate comment on the news. The Beiji oil refinery has a capacity of some 320,000 barrels a day, accounting for a quarter of Iraq's refining capacity. A fire raged for days back in June at one of its storage units, but the refinery is believed to have also suffered major damage elsewhere. Iraq's army and security forces have partially regrouped after melting away in the face of the summer's Islamic State group offensive. ISIS militants retreated from the town of Jurf al-Sakher in the wake of Iraqi military forces fighting back . In recent weeks, they have recaptured a string of small towns and villages, but taking Beiji would be strategically significant in what is shaping up to be a drawn-out campaign of attrition against the extremists. Recapturing Beiji also would be a major boost for Iraq's Shiite-led government. Airstrikes by a U.S.-led coalition have aided Iraqi forces, militias and Kurdish peshmerga fighters battling Islamic State militants. Hundreds of U.S. advisers and trainers also have been working with the Iraqis. U.S. Central Command said yesterday that coalition aircraft have conducted seven airstrikes near Beiji since Friday, destroying three small militant units, a sniper position and two militant vehicles, including one used for construction.","Iraqi soldiers battling ISIS militants have recaptured majority of the town Beiji .

"The mother of a two-year-old girl who . died in agony in hospital after a series of delays said she felt 'let . down by the system' - as a medical expert said her daughter’s death was . 'avoidable'. Tragic toddler Alice Mason died after developing hydrocephalus - water on the brain - which caused irreversible brain damage. An . inquest heard that Alice’s care was blighted by a series of shocking . delays and failures at the three London hospitals that shared her care - . the Royal Marsden in Chelsea, Kingston and St George’s in Tooting. Alice Mason, two, died after doctors repeatedly failed to discuss the findings of an MRI scan. She had suffered irreversible brain damage following treatment for a brain tumour . Today Alice’s mother, Rosalind Mason, said she had serious concerns about the shared care pathway her daughter was put on. In part of her statement, read to West London Coroner’s Court, she said: 'I felt completely let down by the system. 'No child should have to experience what she suffered in the final weeks of her life.' Taking . to the witness stand to give evidence in person, Mrs Mason added: 'I’m . still not convinced that shared care is a safe option for providing care . for very sick children. 'I’m afraid our experience of even trying to find the truth about our daughter has been hugely complicated. 'We . have found that going through the reports they have written in response . to our questions has been very lengthy, we have not agreed with many of . the things they have written. 'It is saddening that this situation is still in place.' Flawed system: The two-year-old's parents Rosalind and Gareth Mason, say they have serious concerns about the shared care pathway her daughter was put on . Alice . had undergone an operation to remove a brain tumour in January 2011 and . had been responding well to chemotherapy, the inquest heard. But . her condition deteriorated and her worried parents took her to the . Royal Marsden Hospital on March 23rd complaining that she was unsteady . and vomiting. She . was discharged that night but continued being sick so her parents . rushed her to Kingston Hospital where they told doctors that specialists . had said Alice should have an emergency CT scan, the inquest heard. But . Mr and Mrs Mason claim their pleas fell on deaf ears as doctors refused . the scan, and said the sick toddler did not 'fit their criteria'. Mrs . Mason said that by March 25th she was 'becoming so frustrated that the . situation with our daughter was becoming more serious and that we . weren’t being listened to.' Alice had undergone an operation to remove a brain tumour in January 2011 and had been responding well to chemotherapy, the inquest heard . She rang doctors at the Royal Marsden and pleaded with them to speed up the process so the CT scan would be done sooner. She added: 'It seemed to us that no action was being taken.' By that night Alice’s condition had deteriorated and she was vomiting more. Mrs . Mason, who kept vigil by her daughter’s bed every night, said: 'I . reported the vomiting to the nursing team and I took a note on my mobile . phone because I wasn’t convinced they were keeping all the records with . the vomiting.' It . was not until March 26th - some three days after Alice was first . admitted - that the scan was ordered and by this point the brain damage . was irreversible. In . a scathing indictment of the care Alice received, an expert doctor said . that Kingston Hospital was guilty of a 'basic failure in care'. Dr . Stephen Rose, consultant paediatrician at Birmingham Heartlands . Hospital, said in his report: 'It is unclear to me why a CT scan was not . undertaken on the face of clear evidence on March 24 and 25. 'Had a CT scan been undertaken it would have shown hydrocephalus with raised intracranial pressure.' He . told the inquest that by 6.30pm on March 25 Alice’s vomiting had . worsened and that the 'threshold' for a CT scan had been crossed. He . was asked by the family’s barrister Jeremey Hyam if the hospital’s . failure to tell a consultant about her worsening condition amounted to . 'a basic failure'. He replied 'I would say so.' He added: 'There is a basic failure to respond and comply with a plan that has been set and order an urgent CT scan.' An inquest heard staff at Kingston Hospital in south London failed to act on the advice of a specialist oncologist at the Royal Marsden Hospital in Chelsea, to give Alice a CT scan if her condition worsened . He . said that if a CT scan had been ordered it would have diagnosed . hydrocephalus and Alice would have been rushed to St Georges for an . operation. Asked by Mr Hyam if the 'death was avoidable' he said 'that is my opinion'. He . also criticised doctors who dismissed the concerns of Alice’s parents . saying a doctor would be 'foolhardy to dismiss the suggestions by the . parents that there had been a deterioration'. He . also raised questions about the operation of shared care systems, which . he said were not robust and relied on phonecalls between individual . doctors rather than shared protocals. After . the scan Alice was rushed to St George’s hospital where specialist . neurological surgeons operated to ease the pressure on her brain. But . she died just days later, on March 30th.","Concerns over shared care pathway blamed for a series of delays .

"A never-before heard tape has been released of one Senator John F Kennedy discussing politics with his wife and friends at a close-knit dinner party, just three days after announcing to the world he would run for the White House. At the small gathering in Washington D.C. on January 5, 1960, JFK and Jacqueline hosted their friends where they discussed his background in politics and why he believed he would make a great president. At the dinner table was Newsweek's Washington bureau chief Ben Bradlee and his wife Tony along with the magazine's correspondent James M Cannon. On the couch with Kennedy: Three days after announcing he would run for president, JFK and wife Jacqueline hosted a small dinner party attended by friends Ben and Tony Bradlee (left and third from left) in Washington . Cannon had asked to tape the party's after-dinner conversation as part of research for his next book. After initial fumblings with the tape recorder - with Kennedy asking 'This is on? Can it get me from there?' - the comments reveal JFK as someone confident and ambitious in his political future. When asked by Cannon why he was running for office when he was wealthy and could live off the 'fat of the land', Kennedy replied: 'I think the rewards are, first, infinite.' On politics and money . 'I mean, it may be more difficult for me to talk about it, but I’ve seen a lot of politicians with money, and I don’t find . . . There’s so many kinds of being dishonest, the money part is just only one of them. I don’t really think you can prove by any test that you have to have money to be successful, politically, or that people with money are more honest than those who aren’t.' On loss of privacy . 'That’s the real pleasure about Jamaica in a way. You really can’t go any- place particularly now without . . . But I don’t mind, I think that’s part of run- ning, so I’m delighted, really. I used to walk down the streets in ’45 and nobody knew me. Now that’s fifteen years of effort has gone into getting known. I mean, it isn’t pleasant for the person, but as an investment of energy it represents some . . . On what sets him apart to be president . I’m having the same struggle that they’re [Americans] having in a different sphere, but in the most sort of dramatic way, for the great effort, the presidency of the United States, my checkerboard struggle is going on. As I say, what is sports, spectator sports, the same thing. Johnny Unitas, he might find it interesting to play in a sandlot team, in front of four people, but he’s playing for the Colts, the best team in the United States, for the world championship. I mean, I must say, he must find that very absorbing. I’m not comparing the presidency with that, but I’m just saying that, how could it be more fascinating than to run for president under the obstacles and the hurdles that are before me. Source: The Smithsonian . He went on to say that originally he 'hadn’t even considered myself, because I’m not a political type' before adding: 'I think it’s hard work. My grandfather was a natural political type. 'Loved to go out to a dinner. Loved to get up and sing with the crowds. 'Loved to go down and take the train up and talk to eighteen people on the train.' Later JFK admitted that he had never dreamed of becoming president, thinking he might be 'governor of Massachusetts someday'. At one point he tells his wife and Tony . Bradlee that they 'might want to go sit in the other room' to which they . protest that they want to be part of the discussion. JFK later told Bradlee, when asked about . the projection of one's self: 'I have a particular type of personality . which, I don't look like a politician, and all the rest, which helps me. 'Everybody isn't an extrovert in politics. I would say that a lot of the Senate certainly are not extroverts...' When asked about the problems he believed that America faced on the brink of the Sixties, he told his dinner guests: 'I think, all the problems, war, the destruction of the United States and the world, every problem, urban problems, agricultural, they’re all . . . monetary, fiscal, labor-management, inflation. 'I mean, they’re terribly sophisticated. In the nineteenth century you only have about three problems: the development of the West, slavery, tariff and currency.' JFK was inaugurated as President of the United States in January 1961, bringing his glamorous wife Jacqueline and young children to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. His era brought huge political and . social upheaval for the country including the Civil Rights' movement, space program, the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War. President Kennedy was assassinated in . Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963. The race is won: President John F Kennedy with wife Jacqueline and VP Lyndon Johnson and his wife Lady Bird at the inauguration on January 20, 1961 .

They are part of two 75-minute CDs - Listening In: The Secret White House Recordings of John F. Kennedy - on sale from September 25. It was at the president's own hand in 1962 that hidden recording systems were installed in the Oval Office and Cabinet Room at a time of tense political strategizing and tactics on a quickly evolving global stage.

"Swansea City chairman Huw Jenkins has warned potential suitors for Wilfried Bony they will have to spend big to land the striker. Chelsea are understood to have scouted the prolific Ivorian in Monday’s 4-1 defeat at Liverpool, but Jenkins insists he has received no approach for his star man. Bony’s camp have previously stated the 26-year-old’s desire to play for a top-four side and his status as the leading Premier League scorer in 2014 has drawn serious interest. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Swansea striker Wilfried Bony was watched by Chelsea's chief European scout against Liverpool . Bony, pictured here holding off Liverpool's Lucas Leiva, failed to score as Swansea lost 4-1 at Anfield . Former Vitesse striker Bony waves to Swansea's travelling supporters after the final whistle on Monday night . But Jenkins told Sportsmail on Wednesday that neither he nor the club has been contacted by a rival for the player, who is understood to be valued close to £30million. He said: ‘There has been no enquiry to me or the club about Wilfried Bony.’ Bony’s haul of 20 goals in the calendar year surpasses any other striker in the top flight. Monk said earlier this month that it would take an ‘astronomical’ offer for anyone to land the striker, who has netted 33 goals since joining Swansea for an initial £12m fee in 2013. Jenkins added: ‘We are in the same position as any other club. Things are as they are. No one wants to lose players and if you are to lose players it has to be for the right offer. Huw Jenkins (middle) insists it will take a big offer for the Swans to part with their star striker Bony . Bony, pictured celebrating against Leicester this season, has scored eight Premier League goals this term . Wilfried Bony - 20 . Sergio Aguero - 18 . Yaya Toure - 17 . Wayne Rooney - 16 . Edin Dzeko - 14 . Daniel Sturridge - 13 . 'Bigger clubs than us have to deal with that – it’s the nature of football these days. We are realistic about that. ‘It’s important to remember we are talking about a player who has scored more goals in 2014 than any other, including people who cost a lot of money.’ Bony is expected to feature against QPR on Thursday night, but will then join up with the Ivory Coast for the African Cup of Nations. Swansea’s hopes of him returning to south Wales from Africa are helped by the contract extension Bony signed last month. Significantly, the extension, which ties Bony to the club until June 2018, addressed the release clause in his initial deal, which is believed to have been set at £19m – a potential bargain for an interested rival, but a clause that would have meant Swansea making next to no profit if someone had triggered it. The 26-year-old rises highest to head the ball towards goal during Swansea's 1-0 win against Aston Villa . Bony has scored more Premier League goals in 2014 (20) than any other player in the division . Liverpool were the most interested in the summer, but are understood to have been put off when they learned what the striker would expect in wages. City’s director of football Txiki Begiristain and head scout Gary Worthington were both in attendance for Monday’s clash, while Chelsea’s chief European scout, Mick Doherty,was also in the stands. Swansea have already signed forward Nelson Oliveira on loan from Benfica to cope with Bony’s Cup of Nations absence and have also agreed a deal for Exeter midfielder Matt Grimes. ‘We have done a lot of our January work already,’ Jenkins said. ‘We have signed Nelson Oliveira and we are signing Matt Grimes and that covers our main priorities. Whatever else happens, happens.’","Wilfried Bony failed to score for Swansea against Liverpool on Monday .

"Police in Italy have captured a secret initiation ritual by Italy’s most feared and powerful mafia on camera for the first time. In a scene seemingly straight out of the Godfather films, the ‘men of honour’ met at an old farmhouse near Lake Como to swear an oath of allegiance to a secret society within the mafia known as the ‘Santa’ . In a separate ceremony recorded by police, the alleged mafiosi took oaths in the presence of a revolver and cyanide capsules to symbolise the penalty for betraying the clan. Scroll down for video . Police in Italy have captured a secret initiation ritual by Italy’s most feared and powerful mafia on camera for the first time near an old farmhouse near Lake Como . Police captured the footage during an investigation into three mafia clans based north of Milan which led to 38 arrests; the footage was released during a press conference today . The rituals were captured as part of an investigation which led to 38 arrests in the north of Italy this morning. Three mafia clans based north of Milan, in the provinces of Como and Lecco in the Lombardy region were being investigated. The Ndrangheta, originally from the Calabria, the ‘toe’ of Italy, have spread their tentacles into the north of Italy and into neighbouring countries forming links with the Colombian cartels and the IRA among others. They supply an estimated 80 per cent of Europe's cocaine. Details of the recorded meeting were revealed on Tuesday by Italian police who released part of the footage. In the quasi-religious ceremony, which also borrows from freemasonry traditions, those present organised their hierarchy and allotted roles to each other. Sitting round a table with heads bowed, the group ‘baptised’ their surroundings. Then the footage shows the boss asking them to agree 'a sacred bond'. For the first time officers witnessed the conferral of a role onto an underage minor, the 16-year-old nephew of one of the other gang members; during the ceremony members repeated 'a secret bond' He is heard saying: 'This sacred evening and under the light and splendour of the stars and the moon we form a sacred bond.' The gangsters repeat after him:' We pledge to deny everything until the seventh generation, to renounce all the criminal societies recognised by me until today, so as to preserve the honour of my wise brothers.' The bond is made in the names of Garibaldi and Mazzini, heroes of the Italian unification who were said to be cited in freemasonry and are thought to refer to nicknames of the group. For the first time officers witnessed the conferral of a role onto an underage minor, the 16-year-old nephew of one of the other gang members. Those arrested by a special police unit were being held on suspicion of belonging to the mafia and extortion, as well as carrying unlicensed guns.","The mafia members met near an old farmhouse near Lake Como .

"In total 62 children and teenagers received the surgery while aged 18 or under. (File image) Hundreds of young people have undergone drastic weight-loss surgery in the last three years, according to a major study. In a grim sign of Britain’s exploding obesity crisis, a 12-year-old boy was among the 570 under-25s to have had an operation to control their weight. Doctors are increasingly turning to surgery to deal with obesity, as traditional approaches fail to cope with the spiralling epidemic. Statistics released today by the National Bariatric Surgery Registry reveal that 17 morbidly-obese children underwent operations while aged 16 or under. The youngest three were boys aged 12, 13 and 14. In total 62 children and teenagers received the surgery while aged 18 or under. The controversial operation, which involves reducing the size of a patient’s stomach so they physically cannot overeat, costs the NHS upwards of £5,000 a time. Critics say such funds should not be spent on a condition seen by many as being self-inflicted. But doctors say the operation saves the NHS money in prolonged treatment down the line. They say it is particularly effective at tackling type two diabetes, a condition linked to lifestyle. Tam Fry, spokesman for the National Obesity Forum, said last night: ‘The age of people undergoing this operation is getting younger and younger. ‘We really now do have an unbelievable number of obese children.’ He said the operation should be used only as a last resort for the very worst cases - and said doctors needed to be especially careful when treating children who had not gone through puberty. ‘You need to be very cautious when treating children - their metabolism has not settled and their body is still growing. ‘But in some cases surgery it is necessary - it can deal with co-morbidities such as type two diabetes. And in some cases it is better not to wait.’ Today’s report, which summarises the records of 18,200 operations from 2011 to 2013, suggests that surgery could offer ‘significant financial savings’ to the health service. The authors found that more than 65 per cent of obese patients with type two diabetes showed no sign of the condition two years after weight loss surgery, which includes gastric band, gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy operations. On average, patients lost 58 per cent of their excess weight a year after surgery, with the figure rising to 68 per cent for gastric bypass patients alone. ‘The huge cost of treating diabetes has led to much focus on bariatric surgery as an effective treatment,’ it said. ‘Simply considering the reduced costs of diabetes treatment, surgery pays for itself within two to three years.’ The NHS is due to vastly increase the number of people eligible for such operations. Draft guidelines drawn up in July by NICE, the health watchdog, proposed doubling the number of those eligible from 900,000 to 1.8million. The proposal, which will be finalised later this month, was criticised by many as offering a taxpayer-funded ‘get-out-of-jail-free card’ for those who could not be bothered to exercise. Consultant surgeon Richard Welbourn, chairman of the registry, said of today’s findings: ‘The NHS is saving money because patients are coming off their diabetes medication as a direct result of their bariatric surgery. ‘This unique database provides clear evidence that bariatric surgery radically improves health for patients with severe and complex obesity. There are two types of procedure which cost the NHS upwards of £5,000. Both reduce the size of the stomach resulting in patients losing their appetite and eating less. (File image) ‘The challenges of raising awareness of the effects of bariatric surgery and increasing service provision are considerable.’ NHS England’s medical director Sir Bruce Keogh said: ‘Obesity and bariatric surgery are rapidly rising up the NHS agenda as a consequence of social and lifestyle choices. ‘As in all branches of medicine, prevention is better than cure, but this report clearly demonstrates that when required, bariatric surgery is effective and safe. ‘This is based on detailed data on over 18,000 patients. The survival rate of over 99.9 per cent and the decreasing length of time spent in hospital is all the more impressive given the increasing illness of patients being sent for surgery.’ Clare Marx, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, said: ‘This audit shows compelling evidence of the cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery for obese patients. ‘Obesity is linked with a number of conditions including diabetes which are not only debilitating for patients but also create a significant financial strain on the NHS.’ There are two types of procedure - gastric bands which cost £5,000 and gastric bypass operations which start at £9,500. Both reduce the size of the stomach resulting in patients losing their appetite and eating less.","A 12-year-old boy was among 570 under-25s to have had controversial op .

"Who could forget that yellow tartan skirt suit, the iconic uniform worn by rich kid Cher Horowitz in the cult movie Clueless. The film is loosely based on Jane Austin's 1816 novel Emma, following the life of the rich and popular Cher Horowitz (Alicia Silverstone) who has a softer side and strives to help the less fortunate. Clueless has since become one of the 90s most iconic films seeing it grossing over $56m and now it is seeing a certain resurgence as it takes the fashion world by storm.

"Arsenal's players looked in good spirits after a successful Christmas period, as they trained ahead of the third of their festive fixtures hoping to pick up another three points. Santi Cazorla and Alexis Sanchez appeared to be having a great time, with the Chilean star in particular unable to suppress his laughter throughout Wednesday's training session. Defender Laurent Koscielny, who returned from injury for the 2-1 win over West Ham on Sunday, was also in a good mood, showing off for the cameras as Arsenal prepared for a trip to Southampton.

Koscielny was wrapped up warm in a hat and a snood during the warm-up as Arsenal prepared for a trip to Southampton on New Year's Day . The Gunners go into the game off the back of consecutive wins which have lifted them to fifth in the table, level on points with Thursday's opponents, and a win could take them as high as third if Manchester United lose at Stoke. But Arsenal may have to play the game without a recognised striker, with Olivier Giroud serving the second game of his three-match suspension and Danny Welbeck doubtful and due to be assessed before the game. However, elsewhere Arsene Wenger's injury problems are beginning to ease, with Theo Walcott and Tomas Rosicky fit again, while Koscielny could be set for a second consecutive start after a stop-start first half of the season.

Per Mertesacker brings the ball down under the watchful eye of his centre back partner Koscielny during Wednesday's training session . Walcott could feature against Southampton having been on the bench following his recovery from a groin problem, and while midfielder Aaron Ramsey is not match fit as he continues to recover from a hamstring injury, Czech playmaker Rosicky should return having been rested. 'Ramsey is not available yet, there is no setback, but it is a bit slower than I expected it to be,' said Wenger on Tuesday. 'Because he had a setback last year, we have to be very cautious with his thigh - he was out for three months, so we have to be a bit more cautious than we would like to be.' Mathieu Debuchy chases the ball as Theo Walcott and Tomas Rosicky exchange passes on a cold morning at London Colney . Arsenal go into Thursday's game knowing that a win will take them above Southampton, and could even see them move as high as third . Arsene Wenger could be without a recognised striker for the vital fixture, with Olivier Giroud suspended and Danny Welbeck a doubt . Wenger accepts it is a difficult balance to keep all of his players fresh over the hectic Christmas schedule and also not lose the dynamic of the team. 'Rotation is a sensitive subject because you can destabilise your team with too much rotation, so you have to find the right numbers of rotating the team,' said Wenger. 'Overall, you want to keep the balance of your team and as well refresh sometimes in the positions where players are a bit tired.'

"John Carver could stay in charge of Newcastle United until at least the end of the season should he impress over the coming two matches. The caretaker boss would love the chance to prove his worth at the helm of his hometown club and will communicate as much to owner Mike Ashley, with whom he has a good relationship. Carver fits the bill of 'head coach' which the club are looking to appoint and he is popular within the dressing room. John Carver could take over at Newcastle until at least the end of the season . The caretaker boss - pictured here with Steve Stone - has been involved with the club since the early Nineties . His future could well be determined by the outcome of matches against Burnley on New Year’s Day and the FA Cup tie at Leicester City 48 hours later. But with Newcastle in the relative comfort of mid-table, there is a feeling that Ashley could take a chance on someone like Carver until the end of the campaign, especially if efforts to bring in an external candidate prove troublesome. The 49-year-old has served on and off at the club in a coaching capacity since the early Nineties having been a reserve-team player with the Magpies before injury curtailed his career. Alan Pardew has said his goodbyes to the players and staff at Newcastle ahead of his Crystal Palace move . Hull boss Steve Bruce has quashed any suggestions that he will be replacing Pardew at Newcastle . Steve Bruce, meanwhile, appears to have ruled himself out of the running for the position at St James’ Park, although were an approach forthcoming that stance could well change.

"Archaeologists in Sweden say they have unearthed the remains of unusually large wooden monuments near a pre-Viking Age burial ground. As the ground was dug in preparation for a new railway line, they found traces of two rows of wooden pillars in Old Uppsala, an ancient pagan religious centre. One stretched about 1km and the other was around half as long. Mystery: Archaeologists in Sweden have uncovered this 1km-long row of wooden poles which is believed to be from the 5th Century, but their purpose is unclear . Unique: The wooden monuments were found near a pre-Viking Age burial ground while work was carried out to prepare for a new railway line . Archaeologist Lena Beronius-Jorpeland said the colonnades were likely from the 5th century, but their purpose is unclear. She called it Sweden's largest Iron Age construction and said the geometrical structure is unique. 'It is a completely straight line and they have dug postholes every 20 feet (6m),' she said. 'They have had an idea of exactly where this line is going and where to build it. 'It is a fairly modern way of thinking and we don't have many traces of these sorts of constructions from that time.' Exciting find: Archaeologist Fredrik Thölin sitting next to one of the foundations where the wooden poles were erected around every 20 feet . Intriguing: Archaeologist Anton Seiler examines one of the foundations which held pillars that were believed to be around 7m high . She said the pillars are believed to have been at least 23 feet (7m) high. Bones found in some postholes indicate animals had been sacrificed there.

"A grandmother endured six gruelling months of chemotherapy after being diagnosed with terminal liver cancer, only to discover she never had the disease. Ann Milne chose to have the treatment to prolong her life in 2008 after doctors told her they had found tumours on her liver. For six months she faced the arduous treatment, which she said caused her hair loss, vomiting and fatigue. In 2009 she went back to hospital where doctors shared the good news, Mrs Milne was free of cancer. But the 56-year-old's elation was quickly followed by despair as the specialists revealed she had never been suffering cancer in the first place. Ann Milne, pictured with her husband Graeme, was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer in 2008. It came five years after the mother-of-four had beaten breast cancer . After treatment appeared to make no difference, doctors called her back to hospital in 2009. They revealed the good news that Mrs Milne, pictured with her children Lynne, Douglas and Neil and grandchildren Skye and Nikole, was cancer free. But her elation turned to anger when they revealed she never had terminal cancer . Today, six years on, the mother-of-four, who was left with permanent muscle damage and needing a stick to walk long distances, has been awarded compensation. She said: 'It has ruined my life, I used to be so full of energy and loved going for long walks with my family, but now I struggle to walk a few metres without getting tired. 'The whole ordeal has aged me by 20 years. I am disgusted I went through chemotherapy for a disease I didn't even have, it could have killed me. 'The strain that this has put on my family is huge, I don't think we will ever be able to get over this, I was effectively given a death sentence.' The former receptionist from Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, was devastated when she was told she had liver cancer, five years after beating breast cancer. In 2003, she found a cancerous lump on her breast, and had a mastectomy and chemotherapy before the cancer went into remission. When she experienced pain in her right arm in November 2008 she went to see her GP. Tests showed a number of lesions on her liver, which doctors misdiagnosed as cancerous tumours. Devastated Mrs Milne, and her husband, Graeme, 50, a crane operator, were told there was nothing doctors could do to stop the cancer killing her. But she was given the option of chemotherapy to give her more time to spend with her children, Lynne, 36, Douglas, 31, Neil, 29 and Paul 28 and her granddaughters Skye, 17, Nikole, 14, Lily and Sienna, both one. For the next six months Mrs Milne endured six sessions of chemotherapy, which caused her to lose her hair, left her vomiting and suffering fatigue. Her face drooped so much that her children thought she had suffered a stroke. The grandmother, pictured on her wedding day in 1995, lost her hair as a result of treatment, suffering vomiting and fatigue and has been left with permanent muscle damage, leaving her needing a walking stick . Chemotherapy is an aggressive treatment for cancer. Drugs are used to kill cancer cells, damaging the cells to prevent them reproducing and spreading. While the treatment is very effective it does cause side-effects. The medications used cannot differentiate between fast-growing cancer cells and other types of fast-growing cells, including blood cells, skin cells and the cells inside the stomach. It means most chemotherapy medications have a poisonous effect on the body's cells, causing problems, including: . Source: NHS Choices . Mrs Milne  even created a memory book to help her children remember her and began to make plans for her funeral. She said she first realised something was wrong with her health when she suffered shooting pains in her arm. 'I just thought it was joint pain so I booked an appointment with my GP. 'I was referred for a scan and three weeks later I was called in where my doctor told me that the cancer had returned on my liver. 'His words hit me like a ton of bricks. The next few minutes were a blur and I felt like I was in my own little bubble. 'The realisation hit me and I started to wonder if I'd get to see my grandchildren grow up and get married. 'I asked the doctor how long I had. He wouldn't answer but I could tell he didn't think I had long,' she said. Although Mrs Milne remembered the horrors of chemotherapy from her previous treatments, she agreed to it for the sake of  precious time with her children and grandchildren. Within a month she began treatment but, after her first session, she was rushed to intensive care when her heart struggled to cope. 'My doctor suggested my body couldn't cope with the strong chemo but I was determined to keep going and had another five sessions every three or four weeks,' she said. The unnecessary treatment has ruined her life, she said. Before being given the 'all clear', she was in the process of creating a memory book for her children (pictureand planning her funeral . The unnecessary treatment has ruined her life, she said. Before being given the 'all clear', she was in the process of creating a memory book for her children (pictured) and planning her funeral . The treatment left her confined to her bed for months with no energy to play with her grandchildren. Her hair also fell out in clumps, her muscles wasted away, she developed flu-like symptoms and loss of appetite. Then, in 2009, after doctors noticed that Mrs Milne's condition was unchanged following the chemotherapy, she was called in to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for a check-up. Mrs Milne said: 'I thought they were going to tell me that I was responding well to treatment. I started to wonder if I'd somehow beaten cancer again, despite the diagnosis. 'When the doctor told me that I was clear of cancer, I felt so happy. But her elation was cut short when she was then told she'd never had cancer in the first place. 'She said the ""tumours"" they had found were just harmless lesions and not cancerous. 'My happiness was soon replaced with anger.' Mrs Milne's family were overjoyed with the news, but she has been left bitterly upset by her experiences. 'They have robbed me of my life,' she said. 'The pain my family have been put through, they thought I was going to die - we will never be able to get over this. 'The problem is that if I get cancer again there is no way my body could handle a third round of chemotherapy, it was a horrific ordeal and I want to put it all behind me. 'My children were ecstatic when they found out I was ok but at the same time to think your mum is going to die within the year is disgusting.' Mrs Milne has agreed a six figure out-of-court settlement with NHS Grampian but she says the organisation have failed to apologise. An NHS Grampian spokeswoman would only say said: 'We can now confirm this matter has concluded.'","Ann Milne was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer in 2008 .

"Victim: NBA coach Marcus Jackson, pictured with wife of 22 years Desiree Coleman, was at the center of an extortion scam by a stripper he was having an affair with . An NBA coach was revealed as the target of an extortion plot after he allegedly sent naked pictures of himself to a stripper he had been having an extra-marital affair with. Mark . Jackson, 47, who currently coaches the Golden State Warriors, was believed to have been blackmailed by exotic dancer Alexis Adams, 28, and ex-convict Marcus Shaw. Jackson, a father-of -four who has been married for 22 years, cooperated with the FBI to bust the scheme. The former NBA star had sent the pictures to Adams in 2006 while they were having a year-long affair. The pair met in New York City while Adams, then 22, was working at a strip club and Jackson was an announcer for the New York Jets. Some of the pictures were of Mark Jackson naked and close-up shots of his genitalia. Adams and Shaw, 40, were arrested this week and accused of trying to obtain a six-figure sum from the NBA star in return for not selling the  pictures to the media. The FBI investigation began in April after Jackson was approached at a hotel in Memphis, Tennessee when the Warriors were playing an away game. The stranger - later picked out by the NBA coach as Marcus Shaw - threatened Jackson with a folder of photos and a voicemail recording that he had left the stripper during their affair. Jackson, who also works as a church pastor, gave the ex-convict $5,000 in return for the folder and destroyed it. Two weeks later, Shaw emailed Jackson's wife Desiree Coleman, saying he was in the 'reputation management business' and demanded more money to prevent the photos being made public. Alexis Adams also called the NBA coach's wife and told her about the affair after Jackson refused to leave his wife for her. The NBA coach then contacted the extortionists to ask how much it would take to end the 'game'. After negotiations, Jackson offered $200,000, writing in an email on May 3: 'I have the money. I . do not want these pictures getting out.' NBA star: Mark Jackson (left) when he played for the Toronto Raptors in 2001 and right, earlier this year as Golden State Warriors coach . However the money never changed hands as the FBI stepped in and were able to identify Shaw from his IP address and Google, Comcast and Sprint accounts. Criminal complaints filed at court in Oakland, California described the victim only as 'V1'  - but he was revealed as head coach Jackson by The Smoking Gun. In the affidavit, FBI Agent Beth Alvarez said that at the time of their liaisons Adams worked at a strip club in New York City. Jackson was working as an announcer for the New Jersey Nets following the end of his NBA career. Alexis Adams now runs a spa in Atlanta, Georgia. She has been charged with conspiracy and extortion and faces five years in prison. She was freed on $25,000 bond. Man of God: Jackson is head coach of the Golden State Warriors and a pastor at True Love Worship Center International in Van Nuys, California . Shaw, was jailed in 1996 for aggravated robbery. He was arrested in Atlanta in 2005 accused of murder, robbery and . kidnapping but the case was dropped. He has been charged with extortion and faces up to two years in jail. He was released today on $30,000 despite the prosecution arguing he was a . flight risk. The relationship between Alexis Adams and Marcus Shaw was unclear. Despite Jackson's alleged affair and embarrassing pictures, he remains married to wife Desiree. The NBA coach has been married for two decades to Ms Coleman and the pair serve as pastors of the True . Love Worship Center in Los Angeles. According to text messages between Alexis Adams and Marcus Shaw, reviewed by the FBI, the ex-stripper sent a message to her accomplice on the night he extorted the coach, reading: 'Concentrate and f*** him up! he is a Fake . a** man of god.'","Mark Jackson, 47, was approached by stranger with a folder of pictures during away game with his team Golden State Warriors .

"Getting to work before it is light and leaving after it is dark during winter months can lead to serious mental health problems, a charity has warned. Going without daily sunlight can lead to feelings of lethargy and depression which may develop into seasonal affective disorder (SAD), Mental Health Research UK (MHRUK) said. The warning comes as a poll found that three in 10 adults rise before sunrise during the winter months and return home from work after sunset. Mental Health Research UK has warned that people who go to work in the dark and get home after the sun has set risk serious mental health problems . The charity’s survey of 2,000 British adults also found that half were concerned that their workplace had little natural light. And almost one in 10 said they had no access to natural light at all while at work. Dr Laura Davidson, mental health barrister and trustee of MHRUK, said: ‘It is estimated that one million working hours are lost each year due to SAD. ‘The common unhealthy work culture where lunch breaks are frowned upon is a likely contributor to the increasing numbers of SAD sufferers. ‘Employers and educational establishments need to take on board just how important natural light is to good mental health. ‘They have a responsibility to ensure that work and study environments have sufficient windows to flood the building with as much natural light as possible. ‘Darker areas must be well-lit to address the negative effects of light deprivation.’ The charity hopes to raise awareness for SAD and depression during its annual wellbeing and awareness campaign, Blooming Monday. People who are not exposed to any sunlight risk lethargy, depression and seasonal affective disorder . On the third Monday of the month, workers are challenged to dress brightly in a bid to combat ‘blue Monday’ - researchers claim that the third Monday of January is the most depressing day of the year. MHRUK said that thanks to a combination of bad weather, debt, the need for Christmas detox and poor motivation, the nation’s collective wellbeing is expected to sink to an all-year low on January 20. It is calling on people to dress in colourful clothing to highlight the plight of those who suffer from the condition and to raise money for research into treatments.

"Keylor Navas says fearless Costa Rica can go on being World Cup world-beaters after victory against Greece put them in the last eight. The hero of the penalty shoot-out said: 'We left our fear at home - that is why we came through a group that had three former World Cup winners in it. We are not afraid of anyone.' Navas is now the World Cup’s most wanted keeper with tiny Spanish club Levante unable to keep hold of their star stopper whose contract runs out in one year and buy-out clause stands at just £6.5million. Wanted man: Atletico Madrid, Liverpool and Arsenal are all interested in Costa Rica goalkeeper Keylor Navas . What a save! The 'keeper made a stunning stop to thwart Theofanis Gekas's penalty against Greece . Ahead of the Brazil tournament the Costa Rican goalkeeper was challenged by Spanish tennis player Pablo Andujar to see how many saves he could make when Andujar was firing tennis balls at him. Andujar hit shots from just outside the penalty area, with some reaching speeds of 100mph. Watch the video above to find out how the Levante shotstopper got on. In the entire World Cup qualifying campaign he conceded just seven goals – only the United States let in fewer than Costa Rica. And having conceded just once in the group matches, against Uruguay, he made the save of the tournament against Greece in Recife to keep out Theofanis Gekas's penalty. Atletico Madrid are interested in Navas replacing Thibaut Courtois, who has gone back to Chelsea after three seasons on loan. But Arsenal, Liverpool and Everton are all monitoring the 27-year-old's situation. He finished last season as La Liga’s second-best goalkeeper based on goals conceded, and the best based on the number of saves made. It was Courtois who conceded fewest goals, but he had the best defence in Spain in front of him. At Levante, Navas had no such protection as was clear on the opening day of the season when he let in seven at the Nou Camp. 'I have had a tough journey to get where I am but I’ve fought hard and now I’m reaping the rewards,' Navas said, recalling how Spanish club Albacete plucked him from Costa Rica’s biggest side Saprissa in 2010. Greeting: Navas chats with tennis player Pablo Andujar before facing 100mph shots from the Spaniard . Poised: Navas stands ready to face one of Andujar's powerful tennis shots . Save: Navas springs to his left to keep out a low shot from Andujar and tip the tennis ball round the post . VIDEO Costa Rica fans celebrate penalty win . He moved to first division Levante a year later and in the first two seasons he was understudy to Uruguayan Gustavo Gustavo Munua but last season became No 1 and the hard work put in under the tutelage of one of Spain’s most respected goalkeeping coaches, Luis Llopis, has reaped dividends. He arrived with the reputation for being a spectacular shot-stopper but Llopis believed he could become even quicker in his area. He is now four or five kilos lighter than when he arrived and Llopis says: 'Hours of training drills based on speeding-up his ability to accelerate, brake and change direction quickly in his area have paid off.' Asked by Marca if Costa Rica have agreed a bonus for actually winning the World Cup Navas said: 'Of course we have. We are just like any other team in the competition. We maybe have fewer options but we have a set of targets with economic rewards.' Hero: Navas celebrates with Costa Rican supporters after their side reached the World Cup quarter-finals .","The Levante stopper was La Liga's best goalkeeper last season .

"Joel Campbell again gave a hint that there was more to come from the Costa Rica forward, despite being starved of service in the last-16 tie against Greece. Costa Rica may have had just one shot on target all game, but the man who will line up at the Emirates Stadium next season was part of everything good they produced and was a handful for an experienced Greece backline. The 22-year-old is an awkward player to get to grips with. The Greeks, usually so defensively sound, found him a nuisance and for long periods they couldn't get near him as he provided a useful outlet for Costa Rican counter-attacks.

Penalty shoot-out: Slots his penalty into the bottom left-hand corner, sending Orestis-Spyridon Karnezis the wrong way. That half of Greece's back four played their club football with Olympiakos last season makes his display even more impressive. These are defenders that should be used to what Campbell does after training with him for a year - but he so often eluded them it looked like they had never heard of him. Campbell is not the answer to Arsenal's striking problems - and labelling him as such would be nothing but problematic. The Gunners still need to sign someone to lead the line but Campbell does provide another option that Arsenal can't currently boast. Against Greece he was a perfect outlet as Costa Rica stood strong in defence, leaving Campbell to stretch the Greek backline, find pockets of space and use his excellent first touch to relieve pressure. He came close to winning a first half penalty after being brought down just outside the area and constantly made himself available. In total, he drew four fouls as the Greek defenders struggled to deal with his ability to find fight spaces before using his low centre of gravity and soft touch to bring the ball under control and keep hold of it. Sadly he couldn't top the performance with a winning goal: missing his best chance as he allowed the ball to go between his legs as he attempted to flick it goalwards in extra time - although he did confidently convert his penalty. The fear for Arsenal fans will be whether he can perform for a big side. Costa Rica haven't been favourites in any of their four World Cup games - in the Premier League Campbell will be expected to help break down underdogs. Roll with the punches: Campbell looked tired towards the end which may have been due to the fouling . Tough to mark: Campbell was a constantly nuisance for the Greek defenders . That can be difficult for any forward: even Romelu Lukaku, who has been so impressive at Everton and West Brom, has struggled to match those exploits in a Belgian shirt in Brazil. But Campbell is different. His characteristics and tricky play gives Arsene Wenger's attacking bow another string and while he may not be the answer to Arsenal's big question, he could pose his own questions of Premier League defenders. Eyes on the prize: Campbell looks determined to get the ball in this aerial challenge . Leading the way: Campbell manages to escape the attentions of Konstatinos Manolas .

"Controversial plans have emerged to move the tomb of the Prophet Muhammad, Islam's second-holiest site. The Prophet Muhammad, born in 570 AD, is believed by Muslims to be the last of God's prophets to mankind who delivered the religion's final revelation. His resting place in Medina, Saudi Arabia is visited by millions of Muslims every year and is seen as the second holiest site after the Kaaba, the famous black cubed building in Mecca. But it emerged last night that a Saudi academic has put forward contentious plans to have the Prophet's remains moved from the tomb over fears by some scholars that the site is leading to idolatry. Scroll down for video . The tomb of Prophet Mohammad at Al-Masjid al-Nabawi in the holy city of Medina. Proposals to move the Prophet's remains threaten to spark discord across the Muslim world . The tomb of the Prophet Muhammad could be moved from the al-Masjid al-Nabawi mosque in Medina, Saudi Arabia, where it is currently housed, under plans reported today . According to the Independent, a 61-page document has been circulated among the supervisors of the holy site proposing that the Prophet's body be moved to the nearby al-Baqi cemetery, where it would be interred anonymously. Dr Irfan al-Alawi, director of the Islamic Heritage Research Foundation, told the newspaper: 'They want to prevent pilgrims from attending and venerating the tomb because they believe this is ""shirq"", or idolatry. 'But the only way they can stop people visiting the Prophet is to get him out and into the cemetery.' Idolatry, known as 'shirq' in the Islamic faith, is the worship of objects or saints and is forbidden in the faith. There is no suggestion that Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah, who is the site's formal custodian, nor the supervisors of the al-Masjid al-Nabawi mosque which contains the tomb have agreed to the idea. The Saudi government has previously insisted it treats the development of holy sites with 'the utmost seriousness'. Prophet . It is feared any plans to move the prophet's remains could cause anger among some Muslims in the region . But it is feared the emergence of plans, which spring from a reform movement known as Wahhabism, could divide Muslims, with both Sunnis and Shias thought to be opposed. Dr Alawi told the Independent: 'The Prophet Muhammad's grave is venerated by the mainstream Sunni, who would never do it. It is just as important for the Shia too, who venerate the Prophet's daughter, Fatima. 'I'm sure there will be shock across the Muslim world at these revelations. It will cause outrage.' Violence in Iraq and the rise of the radical Isis, or Islamic State, organisation has already strained tensions between Sunnis and Shias in the region. The tomb of the Prophet Muhammad is seen as the second most important site for Muslims after the Kaaba in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The Kaaba - which is said to have been built by Abraham - is at the centre of the Grand al-Masjid al-Haram Mosque, which Muslims always face to pray. It is religious duty for those who follow the faith to visit the Kaaba at least once during their lifetime. Millions of pilgrims gather to circle the building during the hajj, a huge five-day pilgrimage to the site each year. The tomb of the Prophet Muhammad is second only to the Kaaba in its importance for the world's Muslims . Many of those visiting the site also take the opportunity to visit Muhammad's tomb, which about 200miles to the north in Medina. The tomb dates back to the seventh century, when Muhammad was buried, and also includes the resting places of early Muslim leaders Abu Bakr and Umar. It is covered by a famous Green Dome and includes a community centre, court and religious school. It can hold hundreds of thousands of visitors during the busy hajj.","Plans have reportedly been put forward to move the prophet's remains .

"Roberto Martinez admits that Everton must tighten up defensively when they face Hull City on New Year's Day in order to halt a run of poor away form stretching back over two months. The Toffees have not won a Premier League match away from home since beating Burnley on October 26th and have picked up just a single point at Sunderland since then. Martinez however, is refusing to compromise on the club's tradition of entertaining possession football. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Roberto Martinez looks on during his Everton's side 3-2 defeat away at Newcastle on Sunday . 'Knowing what your philosophy is as a club is important and ours is one that I think fits very well,' Martinez said at his press conference ahead of the Hull clash. 'It represents Everton from the Thirties to the great years in the Sixties, to winning titles in the Eighties and as a team we want to control the ball and as a team we are great in possession but in any team you need to be able to defend. 'At the moment we are suffering, sometimes through individual errors, sometimes you get three or four major decisions that don't go in your favour and they go against you and you have to cope with that. 'I think it's going to make us a stronger unit and there'll be a real fight to show who's ready to cope with our expectations. 'It's a bit of a negative run of results at the moment and we need to stop it but there's never a question mark over the style and how we want to play. Tim Howard is expected to be out for five or six weeks with a calf injury for the Toffees . 'What's a question mark is whether we've been good in the way we want to play and at the moment we've conceded too many goals for one reason or another and that's quite easy to rectify,' the Spaniard added. The festive period has not been kind to the Toffees having lost their last three matches. Coupled with a run of just one win in their last seven league games, Martinez admits that as far as results go this has been his most challenging period at the helm since taking over from David Moyes. However, he is keen to accentuate the positives in order to turn the team around going into 2015. 'We've become a stronger team than we were last season in many aspects in my eyes but we've become a little bit more open and exposed in terms of conceding goals. 'That's come a little from individual errors but a little from bad luck as well but I think we need to get rid of that negative momentum that makes you a little bit exposed and conceding goals. 'I do think that from where we were last campaign we've improved as a team going forward, our goalscoring record in every game is outstanding.' Everton players look on despondently after conceding the only goal of the game against Stoke . 'Before the Southampton game we had the third best defensive record in the last six games in the league. The stats are very deceiving so you have to be careful. 'Obviously we conceded six goals against Chelsea which is going to affect any stat in the same manner we were also the only team to score three goals past Chelsea. 'At Everton I'll always take responsibility but we're not inferior to anyone and we'll always go into any game trying to win the game. 'What's important is that we're all fighting with real responsibility and understand what it means to be at Everton and we need to find the right way of playing to compete and get through periods like the one we're experiencing now.' While Everton's away record is open to scrutiny, the home form of opponents Hull makes even worse reading. The Tigers have won just once in the Premier League at the KC Stadium this season, against Crystal Palace in October, and have only one further home league win in the whole of 2014. Martinez believes that both sides have struggled somewhat to meet the expectations placed on them by fans at the start of the season after exceeding targets in the last campaign, but, after a 1-1 draw in the reverse fixture at Goodison Park, the Spaniard believes Hull still have the ability to cause his side a threat. Hull boss Steve Bruce - like Martinez - could do with a morale-boosting win to start 2015 in positive vein . 'They are suffering a little in terms of confidence, it happened a little bit to us. They've started the season with huge expectations after reaching the FA Cup final, having a really strong competition in the Premier League. 'They have a lot of new signings coming in but had a bit of an up and down season but they'll be well organised and energetic and it's going to be a well contested game and a difficult place to visit. 'They been in all of the games they played and are always competitive.' 'They're the first team we'll have played twice this season and are a team that are very flexible tactically. 'They have Abel Hernandez forming a good partnership with Jelavic and they've got players all over the park with big influence. 'A big strength of the side is that whoever they have on the pitch knows what they have to do and they're well structured. They have a fighting spirit and will always create chances.' Martinez admits he and Steve Bruce could both do to sign off 2014 with a win. 'It's vital for both teams for no reason other than getting a positive result,' he said.","Everton are on a run of three successive Premier League defeats .

Related to living crown porpoises, the extinct Semirostrum ceruttii had an extension of its jaw called a symphysis that measured 33in (85cm) in the best-preserved specimen, researchers said. Scroll down for video . Chin up: Scans (pictured) revealed extensive nerve canals leading from the symphysis into the rear of the skull, indicating that the protuberance was sensitive and could relay information to the animal's brain . The typical symphysis of a crown porpoise measures just half to one inch-long (one to two cm).Porpoises and dolphins are closely related within a family that also includes beluga and narwhal. The species lived roughly 1.5 to 5.3 million years ago along at least 450 kilometers of the California coast.

The typical symphysis of a crown porpoise measures just half to one inch-long (one to two cm). Scans reveal extensive nerve canals . leading from the symphysis into the rear of the skull, indicating that . the protuberance was highly sensitive and could relay meaningful . information to the animal's brain. The semirostrum was a benthic feeder - an animal that dug for food lodged in . the seabed. Modern porpoises seek food throughout . the water column, preferring inshore, bottom-dwelling, and mid-water . prey, including fish and cephalopods. 'This is unique anatomy for a mammal,' said Rachel Racicot, the Yale doctoral candidate who is lead author of the paper about the research, published in the journal Current Biology. 'And it tells us that porpoises once searched for food in a very different way than they do now.' Ms Racicot and her colleagues . analysed original fossils and CT scans of the best-preserved specimen, . which she describes as 'almost completely preserved'. The . scans reveal extensive nerve canals leading from the symphysis into the . rear of the skull, indicating that the protuberance was highly . sensitive and could relay meaningful information to the animal's brain. The paper is the most thorough description ever of Semirostrum and the first to make the case that the porpoise was a benthic feeder, or an animal that dug for food lodged in the seabed. Modern porpoises seek food throughout the sea, preferring inshore, bottom-dwelling, and mid-water prey, including fish and octopuses. Semirostrum is known from about 15 fossil specimens, all from California, including a remarkably well-preserved holotype specimen found at a construction site in San Diego. The species lived roughly 1.5 to 5.3 million years ago along at least 280 miles (450km) of the California coast. The study is the most thorough description ever of Semirostrum (illustration, pictured)and the first to make the case that the porpoise was a benthic feeder, or an animal that dug for food lodged in the seabed . The name Semirostrum ceruttii refers to the animal's unusual jaw — the rostrum is the lower half of the jaw. The closest jaw structure in living animals is found in birds known as skimmers and in half-beak fish. As Black Skimmers hunt for food, they fly just above the surface of water bodies with their symphysis slightly submerged to probe and scoop small fish and crustaceans. Both skimmers and half-beak fish feed mainly at night, suggesting the importance to them of highly sensitive probes that can relay through touch information about unseen prey.

"Deyka Ayan Hassan said she was 'disgusted' with herself after her vile comment . A student who tweeted that people wearing Help for Heroes t-shirts 'deserved to be beheaded' after soldier Lee Rigby was killed was arrested after complaining to police about getting threatening replies, a court heard today. Deyka Ayan Hassan, 21, contacted officers after receiving hundreds of vitriolic responses to the message on May 22, including threats to rape her and kill her by burning down her home, Hendon Magistrates' Court heard. But she was herself later arrested at home after admitting to police she had tweeted 'to be honest, if you wear a Help for Heroes t-shirt you deserve to be beheaded' as a 'joke' about the design of the item of clothing. The English and politics undergraduate at Kingston University, who lives in Harrow, north west London, was ordered to do 250 hours of unpaid work by magistrates today, having admitted a charge of sending a malicious electronic message at an earlier hearing. Chairman of the bench Nigel Orton told her she could have been jailed for what she did but that magistrates accepted she hadn’t known it was a soldier who had been killed when she posted it. 'The tragic events in Woolwich that day have created a context which made this tweet appear extreme,' he said. 'It had a huge impact and clearly caused offence and distress. We accept you didn’t intend to cause harm and you felt it was a joke. Hassan, who was escorted to court with relatives and friends, meant her comment to be a jokey criticism of the design of the t-shirt worn by supporters of the forces charity, magistrates heard . 'Your act was naive and foolish and without regard to the general public at a time of heightened sensitivity.' The court heard that Hassan’s father works in Somalia for charities including US Aid and Prevent, combating extremism. Magistrates accepted she hadn¿t known it was a soldier who had been killed when she posted her comment . He is also a former 'associate advisor for policing diversity' to the Metropolitan Police. Hassan sat with her head bowed throughout this afternoon’s hearing. The magistrates heard that she tweeted . the message at around 4pm on May 22, just hours after Drummer Rigby was . brutally hacked to death in south east London. At that time, various rumours were circulating via social media about the manner of the soldier’s killing, including that he had been decapitated. Magistrates were told that she tweeted the message to her 600 followers after seeing other people making remarks about the case and wanting to join in. She meant it to be a jokey criticism of the design of the t-shirt worn by supporters of the forces charity, the court heard. But after being alerted by friends Hassan found the message has sparked angry replies, including some saying she deserved to be raped or killed. She immediately closed down her Twitter and Facebook accounts and then went to the local police station, where she was interviewed before being arrested for the original tweet. Katie Weiss, prosecuting, said: 'She said she was making a joke about the design of the (HfH) t-shirt. 'She said it was a comment she would (typically) make about clothes and shoes she didn’t like. After being alerted by friends Hassan found the message has sparked angry replies, including some saying she deserved to be raped or killed, the court heard . Itpal Dhillon, defending, said Hassan admitted that what she wrote had caused 'gross offence' and she was disgusted with herself, having been brought up to be tolerant and respect society. 'At the time she did not know the full details relating to the horrific incident,' Ms Dhillon said. 'She certainly didn’t know that the man who was killed was a soldier and the killing may be motivated by extremist beliefs or values. 'She accepts it (the tweet) was distasteful and disgusting.' Ms Dhillon said her client, works in a shoe shop alongside her studies. She also volunteers with charities including Crisis at Christmas and a local Somali community group. She had not intended any 'racist undertone' to the message, Ms Dhillon said.","Deyka Ayan Hassan, 21, meant the comment to be a jokey criticism of the design of the t-shirt worn by supporters of the forces charity .

"Six friends were killed in a single avalanche during a black weekend in the Alps which also claimed the life of an international ski 'ambassador' from the USA. The deadly period began on Friday when Dave Rosenbarger, a 38-year-old from Oregon, was caught in a tide of snow and ice on the Italian side of Mont Blanc. Three friends who were with Mr Rosenbarger, who spent every winter in the nearby resort of Chamonix and was known as 'American Dave', looked on as he was buried. 'Ski ambassador': Dave Rosenbarger, 38, in a publicity picture for the Patagonia clothing range. He died after he was buried under an avalanche of ice and snow on the Italian side of Mont Blanc on Friday . Beautiful but deadly: Mr Rosenbarger was caught in a tide of snow and ice on the Italian side of Mont Blanc . They managed to dig him out, and he was airlifted by helicopter, said a local police spokesman, but 'he sadly died of his injuries in hospital.' The next day – Saturday – four men and two women aged between 50 and 70 died in the Queyras valley, in the Haute-Alpes department. The party had set off to ski the range, which also straddles France and Italy, but triggered a another massive slide. Pierre Besnard, the Haute-Alpes prefect, said 'the bodies of three of the skiers were found overnight Saturday to Sunday', while the rest were recovered on Sunday morning. All were French nationals, and had spent many years skiing, said Mr Besnard, who said rescue teams had worked tirelessly to try and find them. A helicopter and rescue dogs were all involved in the emergency effort, with police saying an entire plate of compacted snow and ice had dislodged. The skiers had begun their ascent by ski life in the resort of Ceillac, and they were found in Bacha valley, at an altitude of 2500 meters. All had been expected back on Saturday, but the alarm was raised by relatives and friends when there was no sign of them. 'When they set off, the sky was clear and the risk of avalanche estimated at 3 out of 5', said Mr Besnard. An investigation into the tragedy has been opened by the high mountain police Briancon, while surviving family of the deceased are receiving psychological care. Dangerous: Four men and two women aged between 50 and 70 died in the Queyras valley, in the Haute-Alpes department, an entire plate of compacted snow and ice dislodged and buried them . Two skiers, including a guide, were also found dead in the nearby Ecrins range, also in the Hautes-Alpes, on Thursday morning, after being swept away by an avalanche. Mr Rosenbarger, who is survived by his wife, Rosanna Hughes, was an Ambassador for the Patagonia ski and snowboard manufacturer. Company spokesman Josh Nielsen, said: 'He was the epitome of a pure passion skier—someone who didn't do it for the cameras or for the limelight—and was deeply committed to the sport for all of the right reasons. 'Dave was a calculated risk taker and a talented athlete who dedicated his life to climbing and skiing some of the most challenging lines in the world, especially in Chamonix, his winter home.' Some 17 people have died in avalanches in France since the beginning of this season, with the number rising to 30 across the entire Alps range.","Dave Rosenbarger, 38, from Oregon, buried by snow in Chamonix .

"A Dutch teen at the centre of an airline bomb hoax scare has been arrested in Rotterdam. Twitter user @QueenDemetriax, who calls herself Sarah on the website, sent an apparently threatening tweet to American Airlines on Sunday morning and within minutes received a reply from the airline saying her IP address had been forwarded to the FBI. Dutch police have today confirmed they have arrested a 14-year-old over the incident, which saw the girl inundated with angry messages. Rotterdam Police tweeted: 'Dutch girl (14) from Rotterdam arrested after American Airlines threat. Investigation continues. #Rotterdam #Police #Force @americanair' Bad idea: The teen immediately regretted sending this 'joke' bomb threat . Roland Ekkers, a spokesman for Rotterdam police, told MailOnline officers in the city had launched an investigation into the tweet after it was reported around the world. But before detectives could track the girl down, she walked into a police station accompanied by a family member. Speaking this afternoon, Mr Ekkers said: 'Police spoke to prosecutors to decide whether we could arrest her and, after some deliberation, we decided that we could arrest her and she has been arrested. 'She is now being interviewed by specially-trained officers who are used to speaking to young offenders.' Mr Ekkers said the girl has not been charged with any offence, but could face charges related to 'making false threats'. He confirmed authorities in the Netherlands were in touch with law enforcers in the US over the incident, but insisted the investigation was launched by Dutch police alone. The arrest comes after 'Sarah', the name used by the girl on Twitter, tweeted on Sunday: ‘Hello my name’s Ibrahim and I’m from Afghanistan. I’m part of Al Qaida and on June 1st I’m gonna do something really big bye.’ It was just a joke: The girl insisted she was joking and not from Afghanistan, but the airline did not reply . Massive following: Her followers shot up over 30,000 by Sunday night . The airline quickly replied: ‘Sarah, we take these threats very seriously. Your IP address and details will be forwarded to security and the FBI.’ The girl then pleaded with the airline, saying she’s only 14-years-old and from the Netherlands, that she’s never been to Afghanistan. ‘What do you want from me?’ She pleaded. But it was to no avail, the airline did not reply. ‘I’m so sorry I’m scared now.’ she wrote. ‘I was joking and it was my friend not me, take her IP address not mine.’ Infamy: The girl claimed all she wanted was to be famous, but lamented finding the wrong kind of fame . Humility: The girl claimed she was too busy flying around in her own jet to blow up a commercial one . Problem solved: Tweet deleted and FBI 'blocked' The airline did not reply, but Twitter users did. Her followers shot from a couple thousand to over 30,000 by Sunday night. She took note of the gain in followers. ‘I always wanted to be famous. But I meant like Demi Lovato famous, not Osama bin laden famous,’ she tweeted. Both the American Airlines and Sarah’s tweet were eventually deleted, and it is not exactly clear if any call to the FBI was ever made.","The girl took to Twitter on Sunday after tweeting an apparent terror threat .

"A church in upstate New York is giving away a free AR-15 assault during a raffle event later this month, as part of a bid to attract more people to its pews. The Grace Baptist Church in Troy has been distributing fliers saying 'Win a FREE AR-15' beside a quote from the New Testament of the Bible that reads: '... my peace I give unto you ... John 14:27.' Pastor John Koletas has defended the gun giveaway, saying it is an event honoring hunters and gun owners in the area, CBS Connecticut reported. 'The Bible is replete with defending yourself and arming yourself, and being capable of defending yourself,' Pastor John Koletas told WRGB. Guns for God: The Grace Baptist Church in Troy, New York, has been distributing these fliers promoting their March 23 rifle raffle, which they hope will bring more people to the church . Controversial: The Grace Baptist Church in Troy, New York, will give away a free rifle later this month. The church is a two hour drive from the town of Sandy Hook . 'We’re honoring gun owners and hunters. 'And we’re being a blessing and a help to people who have been attacked, viciously attacked, by socialists and anti-Christian people — the politicians and the media. The promotional flier says:'Does the Bible defend my right to keep and bear arms? Qualified attendee will receive a NY legally-modified AR-15 ... All giveaways are absolutely free to enter. 'Our country was built with the King James Bible and the gun.' The Smith & Wesson M&P semiautomatic rifle, the gun manufacturer’s version of the AR-15, is being donated by a local gun shop and meets gun control restrictions found in the legislation known as the SAFE Act. The event will take place on March 23. Assemblyman Steve McLaughlin, who represents the district and will be speaking at the service, said he thinks the raffle is completely normal. 'It’s a legal product. Churches raffle off items all the time,' he told told WNYT. 'My church has a $10,000 raffle every single year. I mean, I don’t know how it’s a controversy, quite honestly, that law-abiding, church-going citizens of New York that are legal gun owners are taking part in a raffle to raise funds for a church. I don’t know why that’s controversial.' Free: An AR-15 assault rifle retails for between $200-$600 . Strangely, the church is only about a two hour drive from Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn, where 20 first-graders and six staff were gunned down in December 2012. After the gunman, 20-year-old Adam Lanza, shot himself. While the rifle raffle may be new to the area, it is a common church occurrence elsewhere in the country, such as Kentucky. According to The Los Angeles Times, Paducah's Lone Oak First Baptist Church got about 1,300 people into their church hall by giving away 25 rifles at one time. A gun enthusiast, Chick McAlister, also gave a talk about guns and sin and Jesus. 'There's no government on the face of this Earth that has the right to take this gun from me,' McAlister told the congregation .","Grace Baptist Church in Troy, New York, has been handing out fliers promoting a rifle raffle .

"Sportswear giant and Olympic sponsor adidas is facing an investigation after revelations that their official merchandise for the London Games is being made by Cambodian garment workers who are paid just £10 a week in basic wages. Adidas is believed to have invested £100 million in the Games and is one of the event's largest sponsors. The firm manufactured the official Team GB outfit designed by Stella McCartney. But the workers at the company's Shen Zhou factory on the outskirts of the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh work up to 10 hours a day, six days a week, the Daily Telegraph reported. Factory line: garment workers at the Shen Zhou factory in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, make Adidas Olympic Games merchandise . They produce the adidas 'fanwear' for the 2012 Olympics that thousands of fans will buy in stores throughout Britain. Workers living in cramped squalid . conditions said they earned $61 (£40) a month for working eight hours a . day, six days a week, plus a $5 allowance for health care. Branding: Team GB track cyclist Laura Trott wears adidas Team GB London 2012 Olympic kit, which is made at a separate factory . They said they could increase their wages to $120 (£78) by adding an extra two hours' work to their day. Adidas told the Mail Online today that workers at the factory earned on average $130 a month and would get a pay rise in September, along with other garment industry workers. A spokeswoman for the campaign group . Labour Behind the Label said that although the minimum wage in Cambodia . was only $66 a month, the amount they considered to be a living wage for . a Cambodian worker with two children was $260. Campaigners said the treatment of the . workers amounted to a breach of an agreement with the London Organising . Committee for the Olympic Games (Locog) that states merchandisers must . pay workers a sustainable living wage. A spokesman for Locog told the Telegraph it was concerned by the allegations and would investigate them. Soun So-phat, a 30-year-old mother of . two, said she sent half of her earnings home to her parents, who look . after her young daughters in their provincial village. She . said she used to earn a living planting rice but the money she earned . was not enough to feed her children, so she left to look for work in the . capital. Now she can feed them, but the money . that's left over is not enough for her to eat properly. 'It is hard . work. I send home $60 per month and I live on $40. I eat three times a . day but it's not good food,' she told The Telegraph. She lives with five other workers in a . single room where they sleep three to a bed on hard, wooden bed frames. They share an attached squat toilet and cook a few feet away. Wet . clothes hang on lines overhead. 'It is difficult but we have to earn money,' she said. Cramped: Soun Sophat lives in one room with five other workers. They share a squat lavatory and cooking facilites. Wet washing hangs overhead. 'It is difficult but we have to earn money,' she says . What price? Young widow Toch Sreynoun, pictured here with her nephew in their rented room, makes merchandise it would take her two weeks' wages to buy . Bitter taste: 22-year-old Sorn Tola (second from right) says that after her last pay rise, rents were put up. Often workers' accommodation is owned by the factories . Toch Srey-noun, 32, who works as a . pattern-cutter making adidas garments, said she had no idea how much . they cost to buy. In an adidas store it was $39.99 – the amount she . earned in two weeks. She sends . more than half her earnings - around $50 a month –  to her mother. Her . father and husband have died and she has a 10-year-old son. A spokesman for adidas confirmed that the factory in Phnom Penh produced Olympic merchandise but denied that the workers' pay and conditions were in breach of the organising committee's standards. He added that the Shen Zhou factory does not produce any kit for Olympic officials or indeed any athletes. Poor pay: A man cycles through the area near adidas' Shen Zhou factory in Phnom Penh. Low-wage workers in Cambodia earn on average $900 a year but adidas did not even pay those working at Shen Zhou the country's minimum wage . Dusk dinner: A garment worker employed by the Shen Zhou factory eats noodles on the street after work on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. One worker, Soun So-phat, said her wages feed her children but there wasn't enough left for her to eat well . Over for another day: Garment workers employed by the Shen Zhou factory that makes 2012 Olympic Games merchandise are transported home . 'Adidas is confident we comply with all Locog standards. Workers at the factory earn an average of $130 a month, which is well above the minimum wage,' he said. A Locog spokesman told The Telegraph: 'We understand that the Shen Zhou factory is part of the International Labour Organisation labour rights programme, which means that it is inspected. 'We regularly remind all of our licensees of the importance we place on the sustainable sourcing code they have each signed up to.' Sorn Tola, 22, said that after the . minimum wage was increased from $56 to $61 in October 2010, the rent . jumped from $25 to $40 a month. Most of the housing blocks that garment . workers live in are owned by various factories, so to make up for the . wage increase, most factories simply raised the workers' rent.","Six-day weeks earn workers in factory of sportswear giant Adidas just £40 a month as a basic rate .

"Taylor Turner, 14, from Basildon, was born with multiple heart defects . While . most teenagers have been looking forward to the start of the summer . holiday, Taylor Turner has been desperate to get back to school. Last . term, all he could manage were a couple of mornings a week - and even . then, his mother Donna made sure he travelled by taxi. Taylor, 14, . rolls his eyes with the frustration of it all. He and Donna share an . incredibly close relationship but he just wants to be with his friends. More than anything, he wants to be 'normal'. But life for Taylor is far . from normal. Born with a life-limiting heart condition, Taylor was . having palliative care at home when, at the age of six, he was thrown a . lifeline. In 2006, he received a heart transplant at Great Ormond Street . Hospital. This gave him eight brilliant years of childhood that his . mother thought he would never see. But now, unbearably, just as he is . getting ready to spread his wings, his donor heart is failing and he . desperately needs another. In December, Taylor could still walk five . minutes round the corner to see his grandfather. Now his condition has . deteriorated to the point where he can no longer climb the stairs. The . shortest burst of exercise could cause a cardiac arrest, which both . frightens him and makes him angry. When he was put back on the . transplant list in May, he was warned the chances of finding a suitable . donor were slim. As the Mail has highlighted, there is a chronic . shortage of donor organs for all ages. Currently, 256 people are waiting . for hearts, 32 of them children, and one in five will die waiting. The . fact that Taylor has already had one transplant presents extra . complications: not only does he have his own antibodies but the donor's, . too, which doubles the risk of rejection. 'This time, Taylor . understands everything that's happening,' says Donna. 'At his last . appointment he asked the team: ""Are you going to let me die?""' Outwardly, . Donna seems calm, but it's just a shell she has developed to hide the . emotional storm raging underneath. She checks on Taylor three times a . night, placing her hand on his chest to make sure he's breathing. 'I . feel we've been fighting this war for ever,' she says. And there are few . places to turn to for support. She is a member of a heart transplant . Facebook group but, as she explains: 'We've had three children in the . group die in a fortnight. When you hear of another death you want to be . sick, then you think, ""I don't want to know"". It makes you selfish.' Taylor was born by emergency caesarean at Basildon Hospital on April 4, 1999, weighing an apparently healthy 8lb 1oz. But . his heart rate was sky-high and he was diagnosed with a list of . problems. He had anatomically corrected transposition of the great . arteries - meaning the main two arteries were plumbed into the wrong . chambers of his heart. As a result, the blood being pumped around his . body was too low in oxygen to supply the body's demands, while too much . oxygenated blood was going to his lungs. Taylor pictured recovering after his heart transplant aged six . He also had . Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, where an extra electrical connection in . his heart made it beat abnormally fast. It would often reach 289 (for a . child under one, from 80-160 is normal), which meant he was at constant . risk of cardiac arrest, where the heart stops pumping. 'I cried for . a whole year when Tay was born,' recalls Donna. 'And then I thought: ""I . need to pull myself together now, because this is our normal"". But . while the doctors kept having meetings, nothing seemed to be getting . better and, inside my head, I was planning his funeral. His problems . were so complex, no one knew what his life expectancy was.' Donna was . told that when he was bigger, at some point Taylor would need surgery . to place a band on the artery that was allowing too much blood to flow . into his lungs, as this would permanently damage the blood vessels. Meanwhile, . Taylor struggled - he would barely feed and didn't reach the normal . developmental milestones, such as rolling over and sitting up when he . should; his skin was grey as his heart struggled to pump enough . oxygenated blood into his system. Taylor's father, unable to cope with the shock of having such a sick baby, left Donna and Taylor's older brother Sam, now 17. During his first two years, Taylor spent more time in Basildon Hospital than at home, and there were frequent emergency dashes. 'Normally, . Taylor's heart rate was 120 beats per minute but I could tell when it . was going up by watching the vein that pulsed in his neck,' Donna says. 'If . it went over 200 bpm - a sign of supraventricular tachycardia (a . dangerously fast heartbeat) - I'd call an ambulance; we were in the . children's ward every week.' There, staff would put ice packs over . Taylor's face or plunge him head-first into buckets of icy water to . shock the vagus nerve, which runs from the brain to the abdomen, into . lowering his heart rate. 'It was unbearable,' says Donna. 'He'd fight a . bit, then stop thrashing. I thought they'd drown him.' When he was . almost three, Taylor had surgery at the Royal Brompton Hospital, London, . to fit the pulmonary band. He also had an external temporary pacemaker . fitted to provide electrical stimulation to correct the disturbances in . his heart rhythm. 'He was a tiny little thing, with skin so thin you . could see his veins,' recalls Donna. 'Everyone said he'd thrive after . surgery. But he was in intensive care for four weeks and we thought he'd . never come off the ventilator.' Three children died on Taylor's ward . while he was there. 'The noise parents make when their child dies is a . sound I never want to hear again,' she says. 'Then their precious . child is taken away on a metal gurney, under a white sheet, and the . parents go with them. How the mums manage to walk, I don't know. The . cardiac ward is like a war zone. You develop a toughness. You focus on . your own child and will him to breathe.' When Taylor was five he went to . school for a couple of mornings a week in a wheelchair. Then, when he . was six, he had a 17-hour operation called a 'double switch' to change . the arteries round. Throughout the surgery, Donna paced, and shopped . for clothes and toys for her son. 'I thought if I bought him enough . stuff, he'd be all right,' she says. Afterwards, Taylor briefly . looked amazingly healthy. But three weeks later he was worse than . before. 'The doctors said there was nothing else they could do, and we . were offered palliative care; I had to draw up a plan for how I wanted . him to die, and it felt as if I was signing his death certificate. It . was like giving up - and I wasn't ready to do that.' Taylor and his mother Donna. They are now waiting for a new heart . Taylor's team at . the Brompton, desperately trying to buy him more time, asked Great . Ormond Street Hospital, which specialises in children's heart . transplants, to assess his suitability. By then, Taylor had end-stage . heart failure, his heart only just keeping him alive. He could barely . walk. Three months later, on November 11, Armistice Day, he had his . transplant. 'We are forever grateful that someone who lost a loved one . had the selflessness that gave Taylor a new life,' says Donna. When Taylor came back from surgery she didn't recognise him because he was pink, not grey. Taylor, . always tiny, began to crave big meals such as roast dinners, and grew . in front of her eyes. After Christmas he was able to go to school . full-time, and he never looked back. His life since has been full of . fun. But although he loves sport and the house is full of medals and . cups he has won in the National Transplant Games, Donna has never . completely relaxed. 'A transplant will only last 15 to 20 years,' she . says. 'You know it's not for ever.' At a routine check-up last . October, there was devastating news. Taylor has developed a form of . rejection of his new heart, which causes his arteries to narrow. His . heart can't pump blood around his body fast enough, so he is at . constant risk of cardiac arrest. 'I was absolutely hysterical and, at . the same time, trying to be strong for Taylor,' says Donna. 'The shortage of organs is such that they wouldn't put Taylor on the list until he's dying. We have now reached that point. 'His . consultant said: ""Taylor, if you do PE, you will drop down dead"".' He . isn't allowed to do any activity that would cause his heart to pump . faster, and spends most of his time on his Playstation.'At parents' evening recently, Taylor's teachers said he has so much potential but, . since he had this devastating news, he has been difficult and . destructive. He dreams of being a PE teacher, but doesn't know if he'll . be alive long enough to take his GCSEs.' Taylor talks about another . teenage boy he met at Great Ormond Street. 'He was scared. I told him: . ""Don't worry, the surgery will be fine."" But, in the end, he didn't get . his heart in time and he died.' How does Taylor cope? 'Honestly, I . don't think about it,' he says. 'There's no point. I'm really hoping for . a new heart, but in the meantime I just get on with my life. What else . can I do?'","Taylor Turner, 14, from Basildon, was born with a life-limiting heart condition .

"Eight Transportation Security Administration screeners were fired after they were captured by surveillance cameras sleeping on the job, or violating other standards. The former employees, who all worked at the Newark Liberty International Airport, were caught napping in a baggage room . This is the latest round of firings in the trouble-ridden TSA, only weeks after seven workers in Philadelphia were fired for bribery. Sleeping on the job: Eight Transportation Security Administration screeners were fired after they were captured by surveillance cameras sleeping on the job, or violating other standards . The shipping news: The former employees, who all worked at the Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, were caught napping in a baggage room . Some of the eight workers were caught on videotape in December, napping in a checked-baggage room in the airport’s Terminal B, TSA said. The TSA would not say how many of the firings were for sleeping on duty. To add insult to injury, the TSA is also investigating photographs of government supervisors apparently sleeping in front of bomb-detecting monitors. Two of the supervisors say they were not working at the time the photos were taken, according to New Jersey’s Star-Ledger. TSA spokeswoman Lisa Farbstein said in a statement to MailOnline: ‘TSA holds all of its employees to the highest professional and ethical standards and has a zero tolerance for misconduct in the workplace. ‘Accountability is an important aspect of our work and TSA takes prompt and appropriate action with any employee who does not follow our procedures and engages in misconduct.

An organiser with the Association of Federal Government Employees Union said that they would appeal all eight of the TSA’s terminations. By request of Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-New Jersey), the Office of the Inspector General in the Department of Homeland Security is looking into the TSA of Newark, following several security breaches at the airport. Sen. Lautenberg called the investigation ‘a tough but necessary corrective action to fix a disturbing pattern of misconduct.’ But workers told the Star-Ledger that these investigations have passed over upper management, all while pitting lower-ranking workers against one another.","Eight TSA workers fired after they were caught on video napping in a checked baggage room or violating other standards .

"President Obama has now admitted that he did live with his illegal immigrant uncle for weeks as a law student even though he initially denied ever meeting the man. The backpedaling admission comes after Onyango Obama said during his immigration court hearing that he hosted his young nephew Barack for several weeks back in the late 1980s. The White House had previously put out a statement saying that the President had never met the man claiming to be his uncle, but they reversed their position after Kenyan-born Onyango was given permission to remain in the country and apply for legal citizenship status. Family resemblance? After initially denying that he had ever met his uncle Onyango Obama (right) but put out a statement reneging that today . The first hint that the two actually did know each other came in the President's book 'Dreams From My Father' when he describes an uncle named Omar who matches Onyango's age and life story. The White House used that version of his name in their concession on Thursday. 'The president first met Omar Obama when he moved to Cambridge for law school,' White House spokesman Eric Schultz told The Boston Globe. 'The president did stay with him for a brief period of time until his apartment was ready. After that, they saw each other once every few months, but after law school they fell out of touch. An uncle's duty: Onyango, 69, said that he happily took a young Barack Obama in and housed him for three weeks while he was just starting at Harvard Law School in 1988 . 'The president has not seen him in 20 years, has not spoken with him in 10.' The debate over the President's relationship to the 69-year-old man began in 2011 when Onyango was pulled over for drunken driving. When he was taken to the police station in Framingham, Massachusetts, he allegedly said: ‘I think I will call the White House.’ The elder Obama has lived in the United States since the 1960s, when he came here as a teenager to attend school. Obama, a liquor store manager, was ordered to leave the country in 1992, but remained. Days as a student: Before heading up to Boston for law school, a young 'Barry' Obama attended Columbia University for his undergraduate studies . The drunken driving incident brought the immigration issue back to the attention of law enforcement. Boston Globe journalist Maria Sacchetti was in the courtroom on Wednesday, saying that Onyango admitted . he 'made a mistake drinking 3 beers' before getting behind the wheel . that night. He . listed his relatives that live in the U.S., including the most famous . family connection: 'I do have a nephew. He's the President of the United . States.' Outside of court, he said he was happy to have his young nephew stay with him in Cambridge when he was starting out at the prestigious law school. 'It’s a good thing to let your nephew stay with you,' he said according to The Boston Globe, saying that his close family helped one another out. 'Our brother’s kids are your kids as well.","Onyango Obama, 69, has been an illegal resident of the U.S. since his student visa ran out in 1970 .

"Manchester United have been warned they may have to break the world record fee for a defender after enquiring about Paris Saint-Germain defender Marquinhos. United stumbled through a 0-0 draw at Cambridge United in the FA Cup fourth round on Friday which left more questions about the strength of their squad and their defence continues to look fragile. They have sounded out the French champions ahead of a possible summer move for the stylish Marquinhos. Paris Saint-Germain centre-back Marquinhos has been linked with a move away from the French champions . The 20-year-old is under contract until 2018, but Manchester United are said to be interested in him . Manager Louis van Gaal has drawn up a list of potential targets and the Brazilian is among those names, however, they have been warned the defender won't come cheap. The 20-year-old central defender joined PSG 18 months ago from Roma in a £23.4million deal but has found himself playing at right-back to accommodate the arrival of David Luiz this season. United value Marquinhos at around £30million but PSG have laughed off those figures and United would have to supass the £50m fee PSG paid to Chelsea for Luiz to get him. His agent Giuliano Bertolucci said: 'Last summer, PSG's president Nasser Al-Khelaifi declared that Marquinhos was unsellable. We will see what their position is this summer. Many clubs are interested in the player. Manchester United are one of them, this is true.' Marquinhos appeals to Van Gaal as he can play in a four or three-man defensive line and is comfortable in possession. Thiago Silva (near left) and David Luiz (near right) have been playing ahead of him for PSG this season . United predictably are being quoted huge sums for their defensive targets as they weigh up options for the summer. Atletico Madrid's Diego Godin would be £28.5million, Borussia Dortmund's Mats Hummels will command £30m and Nicolas Otamendi at Valencia has also been discussed but the Spanish side want his buy-out figure of £37m. The fact Marquinhos has been moved aside to allow compatriots Luiz and Thiago Silva to form PSG's central defensive partnership has encouraged United they could persuade the player to move. Under-fire Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal is keen to land a new defender in January . Talking to Le Parisien, Bertolucci added: 'Marquinhos wants to become the best defender in the world. He is not a lesser player compared with Thiago Silva or David Luiz. 'He respects the decisions of his coach, but just wants to play and spend as little time as possible on the bench. Marquinhos is prepared to play at right-back and even in defensive midfield if he has to.' Marquinhos has made 47 first-team appearances for PSG since joining the club from Roma in July 2013. United, meanwhile, have yet to agree new contracts with young defenders Paddy McNair and Tyler Blackett with both players free to talk to foreign clubs.","Paris Saint-Germain centre-back Marquinhos has been linked with a move .

"MPs are demanding a bigger expenses bill so they can live in some of London’s most expensive districts – and avoid using public transport. Generous rules already allow MPs to claim £20,000 to rent a second home but some are complaining it is not enough to fund ‘suitable’ accommodation close to Westminster. Officials at the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) insisted ‘MPs should, where possible, be treated in the same manner as other citizens’ but is now considering increasing the rent limits so MPs can live within walking distance of the Houses of Parliament. MPs say they should be able to claim expenses to live within walking distance of the Houses of Parliament, so they do not have to use public transport late at night . Critics said Westminster is one of the most expensive places to live in the country, and hard-pressed taxpayers should not have to foot the bill to make life easier for MPs. Public anger over MPs expense threatens to erupt again after details of their landlords were published. At least eight are renting flats from other MPs, peers or ex-MPs who continue to benefit from the taxpayer despite no longer being in the Commons. Of 320 MPs who claim expenses for renting in London, 51 successfully blocked details of their landlord being made public. Those affected include Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, former Labour Cabinet minister John Denham and Nadine Dorries, who has been suspended from the Tory party for taking part in I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here. It also emerged that former dfence minister Sir Peter Luff is renting a London flat from Chelsea footballer Frank Lampard. The names of the landlords to 51 MPs were blocked after protests from Commons Speaker John Bercow . Now MPs have complained to IPSA that its rules insisting they can use public transport like everyone else are unfair. They . have suggested their desire to live close to Parliament, the London Eye . and Trafalgar Square is movtivated by ‘security concerns’ IPSA . said: ‘Some MPs who rent in London have raised concerns that they have . difficulty finding suitable rental accommodation close to Westminster . within the annual Accommodation budget. ‘Some . of these MPs wish to live in flats which are within a short walking . distance of Westminster, citing reasons such as security concerns . (particularly when there have been late sittings of the House of . Commons) and the need to live in a convenient location because of the . unpredictability of parliamentary business.’ However, from this year the Commons now only sits late on Mondays, starting at 2.30pm and finishing at 10.30pm. Late sittings on Tuesdays have been dropped and the Commons now begins business at 11.30am, rising at 7.30pm. IPSA rules state that the expense regime is ‘designed to support the renting of a property which is within reasonable travelling distance of Westminster’. ‘It is not calculated on the basis of walking distance from Westminster,’ IPSA adds.  ‘Working on the presumption that in matters relating to expenses, MPs should be treated in the same manner as other citizens, the IPSA Board has taken the view that it is appropriate for MPs to use transport to get to work, in common with members of the public.’ Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘MPs already get substantial living allowances, so it’s not right that some have approached Ipsa to see if they can have more taxpayers’ money to move within walking distance of the House. ‘That will mean much more expensive bills for hard-pressed families as rental costs in Westminster are some of the most expensive in the country.’","Commons watchdog launches review of expenses regime after MPs complain they cannot afford to live in Westminster .

"A controversial pause in global warming may be due to heat vanishing into the depths of the Atlantic and Southern Oceans. But surface . temperatures will start rising again in a decade, according to scientists in the US. The massive movement of heat is thought to explain why the rapid rate of climate change that marked the end of the 20th century has ground almost to a halt. Scroll down for video . A pause in global warming may be due to heat vanishing in the ocean. The top image shows global average surface temperatures, where black dots are yearly averages. The middle image of heat content, compared to the average, in the north Atlantic Ocean. The bottom image shows the salinity of the seawater . A sudden shift in northern Atlantic salinity, making water saltier and dense, is believed to have triggered the effect. 'When it's heavy water on top of light water, it just plunges very fast and takes heat with it,' said Professor Ka-Kit Tung, one of the study authors from the University of Washington. Since the turn of the century, little increase in the average temperature of the Earth's surface has been recorded. At first the unexpected finding was thought to have been no more than a blip, but then it began to divide the scientific community. More than a dozen theories have been proposed to explain the global warming 'hiatus' ranging from air pollution to volcanoes and sunspots. 'Every week there's a new explanation of the hiatus,' said Professor Tung. 'Many of the earlier papers had necessarily focused on symptoms at the surface of the Earth, where we see many different and related phenomena. We looked at observations in the ocean to try to find the underlying cause.' This schematic shows the trends in temperature and ocean atmosphere circulation in the Pacific over the past two decades. Colour shading shows observed temperature trends (°C per decade) during 1992-2011 at the sea surface. The bold and thin arrows show an overall acceleration of the Pacific Ocean moving warm, surface waters (indicated by the blue arrow) to below 700 metres beneath the surface . Professor Tung's team analysed recent recordings of deep sea temperatures from Argo floats, oceanographic sensors that can move vertically through the water column. Water sampled at depths down to 6,500 feet (2,000 metres) showed an upsurge in heat sinking in around 1999, the year when global warming suddenly slowed down. The scientists believe the downward migration of heated water, which is not seen in the Pacific ocean, is part of a naturally occurring cycle. The global average temperature has risen only slightly since 1998 – which is surprising, considering scientific climate models predicted considerable warming due to rising greenhouse gas emissions. Some people used this apparent contradiction to question climate change per se – or at least the harm potential caused by greenhouse gases – as well as the validity of the climate models. Meanwhile, the majority of climate researchers continued to emphasise that the short-term ‘warming hiatus’ could largely be explained on the basis of current scientific understanding and did not contradict longer term warming. Recently, researchers have been looking into the possible causes of the warming hiatus over the past few years. In a separate study, ETH Zurich recently concluded that two important factors are equally responsible for the hiatus. One of the important reasons is natural climate fluctuations, of which the weather phenomena El Niño and La Niña in the Pacific are the most important, they claim. According to the study, the second important reason for the warming hiatus is that radiation from the sun has been weaker than predicted in the past few years. 'There are recurrent cycles that are salinity-driven that can store heat deep in the Atlantic and Southern oceans. After 30 years of rapid warming in the warm phase, now it's time for the cool phase,' Professor Tung said. The cycle starts when dense, salty water near Iceland starts to sink. This changes the speed of the huge Atlantic ocean current that circulates heat around the world. Historical data suggests that similar events in the past have lasted for 20 to 35 years. The phenomenon may have been responsible for a cooling period between 1945 and 1975 which sparked fears of a new Ice Age. Global warming is likely to pick up again in another 15 years or so, when heat returns to the surface waters, say the researchers. British climate expert Professor Andrew Watson, from the University of Exeter, said: 'It will be very interesting to see whether their finding that during the last decade the heat has penetrated to depth mostly in the Southern and Atlantic Oceans stands up. 'It does make oceanographic sense however, because we know these are the major sites for deeper water formation - water from the surface Pacific does not penetrate nearly so deeply into the ocean.' 'The hiatus has a really interesting morphology,' said Piers Forster, Professor of Climate Change at the University of Leeds. 'This paper suggests that heat disappearing into the depths of the Atlantic and Southern oceans are the dominant cause. Their ideas seem fine but I'm also convinced there is more going on. 'Most importantly, this paper is another nail in the coffin of the idea that the hiatus is evidence that our projections of long-term climate change need revising down. 'Variability in the ocean will not affect long-term climate trends but may mean we have a period of accelerated warming to look forward to.' Shown here are the global monthly mean sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies from 1961-90. Sea surface temperature is the temperature of the top millimeter of the ocean's surface. An anomaly is a departure from average conditions. Some scientists believe winds in central and eastern parts of the Pacific have caused warm surface water to sink to the ocean's depths .","This could explain the rapid change in climate at the end of 20th century .

"A nurse accused along with nine others of trying to exploit France's richest woman, Liliane Bettencourt, pictured above, tried to take his own life a day before the trial was to begin . A nurse accused along with nine others of trying to steal part of L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt's £25 billion fortune tried to take his own life a day before his trial was to begin. The deputy prosecutor told a Bordeaux court today that Alain Thurin, 64, wouldn't be appearing in court this week as he had attempted to commit suicide yesterday. Thurin was charged along with nine others of exploiting the 'vulnerability' of 92-year-old Mrs Bettencourt - France's richest woman. It is not known whether Thurin survived the suicide attempt. The trial centres around a feud between Mrs Bettencourt and her daughter Francoise Bettencourt Meyers that grew into a complex web of betrayal and dodgy dealings involving close to a dozen people. It also involves a butler's betrayal, advancing dementia, unscrupulous friends and cash-filled envelopes for senior politicians. The five week trial has become known as the 'Bettencourt Affair'. Many expected former president Nicolas Sarkozy to have been dragged into proceedings, but he was cleared of any wrong doing last year. Potential charges of tax evasion against Mrs Bettencourt were also dropped. This was despite prosecutors accusing Mr Sarkozy's lieutenants of illegally accepting brown envelopes full of cash from Mrs Bettencourt in order to fund his election campaign in 2007. French authorities also ordered Mrs Bettencourt to pay back some £86 million in unpaid taxes after allegedly trying to hush up her purchase of an entire island in the Seychelles. Mr Sarkozy's former campaign treasurer, Eric Woerth, is among the 10 defendants, along with Patrice de Maistre, who managed Mrs Bettencourt's billions. Both men face up to five years in prison after being charged with money laundering, as well as taking advantage of Mrs Bettencourt's 'vulnerability'. De Maistre is heard in tapes seized by the prosecution encouraging Mrs Bettencourt to avoid paying tax - including hiding the purchase of the private island. Mrs Bettencourt's daughter, Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, was locked in a bitter dispute with her mother . Mrs Bettencourt's butler, Pascal Bonnefoy, started recording her conversations in 2009 in an attempt to gather evidence that she was being manipulated by those around her .

Francois-Marie Banier, an artist and photographer, became a close confidant of Mrs Bettencourt and she showered him with gifts, including paintings by Picasso and Matisse and millions in cash. Banier, along with his life partner Martin d'Orgeval and three of the L'Oréal heiress' notaries, are facing charges. Pascal Wilhelm, who was Mrs Bettencourt's estate manager after de Maistre, French businessman Stephane Courbit, tax lawyer Carlos Vejarano, and Mrs Bettencourt's fiscal lawyer Fabrice Goguel complete the line-up in court. Mrs Bettencourt's daughter, Ms Meyers, filed charges against Banier in 2007 for exploiting her mother's growing mental fragility.

Mrs Bettencourt was declared unfit to run her own affairs in 2011 after a medical report showed she suffered from Alzheimers disease. Her fortune and the L'Oreal company, which was founded by Bettencourt's father Eugene Schueller in 1909, is now under the guardianship of family members.

"The start of this season's January transfer window has been delayed by 24 hours to open on Saturday – so it fits in with FIFA's wish that it only runs for 31 days. Clubs have been informed that for 2015 the window will open at the weekend rather than on Friday January 2, as would normally be expected. The reason is that the last day of the month, January 31, falls on a Saturday when there is a full fixture list including the potential title decider between Chelsea and Manchester City. Werder Bremen's Eljero Elia, who is set to go on loan to Southampton, cannot join before January 3rd . The transfer window opens a day later than would be expected, to fit in with FIFA's guidelines . England: Jan 3rd - Feb 2nd . Spain: Jan 2nd - Jan 30th . France: Jan 3rd - Feb 2nd . Italy: Jan 5th - Feb 2nd . Germany: Jan 3rd - Feb 2nd . Scotland: Jan 3rd - Feb 2nd .

China: Jan 1st - Feb 27th . Vietnam: Oct 21st - Jan 12th . With Sunday not classified as a business day, that pushes back the close of the window to Monday February 2. FIFA have ruled for reasons of fairness and to avoid any major league gaining a competitive advantage, all transfer windows should run for a maximum of 31 days. Starting on January 2 and running to February 2 would mean the English transfer window being open for 32 days, hence the later start. A Premier League spokesman confirmed: 'This is about the FIFA Transfer Matching System (TMS) – the system through which all international transfers have to be registered. TMS can only be open for 31 days in the winter window (FIFA rules). 'We have decided to align our window with that in mind. Our rules state that if the final day of a transfer window is a weekend or bank holiday we carry it over to the next working day. This time, January 31 is a Saturday so we will finish on February 2. 'If you count back 31 days from February 2 then you get to January 3 so that is when we are starting. The Bundesliga and Ligue 1 are doing the same. La Liga actually start a day earlier on January 2.' An FA spokesman confirmed said: 'The window will open at midnight going into Saturday January 3, and close at 11pm on Monday February 2.' Total spending by Premier League clubs last January was £135million. The record is £225m spent in 2011. It means that clubs in Spain's La Liga will be able to begin their business earlier than the Premier League's top teams, although the window shuts three days earlier for the likes of Real Madrid. Danny Welbeck's £16million move to Arsenal was the biggest move on last summer's transfer deadline day . Manchester United signing Juan Mata and Nemanja Matic re-joining Chelsea were last winter's biggest deals . Most top European leagues, including France's Ligue 1 and Germany's Bundesliga, share the same dates as England, though some, including Italy and Holland, will begin later, opening on Monday January 5. However in Northern Ireland the window will swing open at midnight on New Year's Eve, lasting the whole of January, with the Irish FA seemingly unworried by public holidays. That is nothing, however, compared with Chile, who decided to open their transfer window on Christmas day. Argentina keeper Sergio Romero is among the players tipped for a move to England during the window . The earliest opening window that will still be active in January can be found in Vietnam, where transfers have been possible since mid-October (as part of their longer period, the equivalent of our summer transfer window), while the likes of Russia and Ukraine don't open until the end of the month. A full list of when every country's transfer window is open, from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe,  can be found here.","English clubs able to start buying players again on January 3 .

"Raising awareness:  Paul Duffen, pictured with his wife Emma, suffered 'sparkles' in his vision which turned out to be cancer . The look was more rock star than former chairman of Hull City Football Club. So when Paul Duffen was spotted last month on the far-from-sunny terraces at Hull sporting the kind of sunglasses of which U2 frontman Bono would be proud, fans were understandably curious. In fact, his eyewear was not a fashion statement. During the summer, the 56-year-old entrepreneur was diagnosed with a rare and deadly form of cancer in his right eyeball. Within ten days he was undergoing surgery to have the eye removed. ‘It has been a body blow,’ admits Paul, who lives in Surrey with wife Emma and the youngest three of their five children. The first sign that something wasn’t right came at Easter, when he began to notice ‘sparkles’ in his vision. The flashes of light occurred most often when he stood up or moved suddenly. ‘My GP said he thought it was probably due to a problem with my sinuses and prescribed me antibiotics and steroids,’ Paul recalls. But the episodes persisted, and by August the problem became hard to ignore. Working at his desk one day, Paul noticed a flash so bright that he turned his head, mistakenly thinking somebody had taken a photograph. He booked an appointment with an optometrist for the following morning – and the examination revealed a tumour growing on the retina. There are about 600 cases of uveal melanoma diagnosed in the UK each year. A body scan showed that the cancer hadn’t spread, but Paul will need regular check-ups as in half of cases tumours return in other parts of the body, particularly the liver. Ten days later Paul saw consultant surgeon Victoria Cohen, director of the London Ocular Oncology service. Proton-beam therapy – a precise form of radiotherapy – was considered but discounted by Paul because it would have resulted in blindness in any case. He elected to have his eye removed instead. Scroll down for video . ‘This is required in about a third of the patients we diagnose with uveal melanoma,’ says Mrs Cohen. Paul had little time to analyse his feelings about losing an eye before the surgery was carried out. ‘Yes, losing an eye was tough but I didn’t spend much time worrying about it,’ he says. ‘It was a logical decision.’ The operation to remove the eyeball was carried out in September. At the same time, a temporary prosthetic ball, made from coral because of its similarity to human tissue, was implanted and attached to the remaining muscles, which means it can move in the same way as a real one. Hull City fans were curious when they spotted Paul wearing glasses more akin to Bono from U2 . Former Hull City chairman Paul Duffen, left, pictured in 2009 with former Hull City manager Phil Brown . A permanent prosthetic ball will be fitted once the post-surgery swelling subsides. Paul tends to wear sunglasses while out to disguise his missing eye until the permanent prosthetic is fitted. He is able to drive again and is back at work – he is president of an international publishing firm and sits on the board of several other companies, as well as running a football consultancy. ‘I find commuting a challenge – particularly the concourse at London’s Waterloo Station, where people are rushing at you from different directions,’ he says. Paul is now evangelical about raising awareness of eye health and is campaigning with the College of Optometrists to emphasise the importance of regular examinations. ‘I’ve been lucky to have perfect vision all my life and have never been very aware of eye health as a result. 'I really want to encourage people to go for an eye examination once every two years. An eye exam can pick up early warning signs for cancer, blood pressure and diabetes. 'If I’d known how important they were, there’s every chance I’d still have both my eyes.’","56-year-old was diagnosed with rare form of cancer in his right eyeball .

"Spozhmai, the 10-year-old Afghan girl sent to blow up a police checkpoint last week, has said her father and brother forced her into it . An eight-year-old girl wearing an explosive suicide vest was stopped by Afghan police as she tried to carry out a deadly attack. The Interior Ministry said police had apprehended the young girl who had intended to carry out a suicide attack against Afghan border police in southern Helmand province. The girl, named as Spozhmay, by NDTV, is reported to be as young as eight and thought to be the sister of a prominent Taliban commander. She was said to be in a state of shock and confusion. In a statement, the Interior Ministry said the girl claimed her brother, a local Taliban commander, had sent her on the mission. According to spokesman Sediq Sediqi, one of the Afghan soldiers spotted the girl wearing a suicide jacket. But she was arrested before she could carry the attack as she struggled to operate the detonator. The girl has now been transferred to the provincial capital of Lashkar Gah. In 2011 an eight-year-old girl died . after she was tricked into carrying a concealed bomb close to a police . vehicle, where it was remotely detonated. The . incident occurred in a remote village called Uwshi, in the Charchino . District, said Fazal Ahmad Shirzad, the police chief of Uruzguan . Province. In July it emerged that Taliban . insurgents in Afghanistan are bribing starving children as young as . eight years old to plant deadly roadside booby traps, be decoys in . ambushes and even act as suicide bombers. Scroll down for video . According to interior ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqi, one of the Afghan soldiers spotted the girl wearing a suicide jacket. But she could not operate the button to detonate the suicide vest . She claims her father has demanded she return home and says he will force her to put the vest back on . Despite the . Islamic fundamentalists’ claim they have no children in their ranks, . extremists have been actively recruiting orphaned and homeless young . boys and training them to use guns, improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and suicide vests. In . return, they ply the desperate youngsters with sweets and chocolate, an . investigation for Channel 4’s Dispatches programme learned. Afghan orphan Neaz told how he was . just eight when he was promised a handful of coins by Taliban fighters . to convert him to their cause. Allegations: The Taliban have refused  to accept responsibility and claim they have no children in their ranks . The boy had been tending his father’s . flock of sheep when coalition forces bombed his village. ‘The . Taliban were hiding in our house when a helicopter came and bombed us,’ he said. ‘My father was hit in his heart and his head, he was torn . apart. My mother was hit in the chest and died. I have no one.’ In . the immediate aftermath of the raid, Neaz was kidnapped by Taliban . leaders and taken to a nearby town and shown how to use guns and make . IEDs. They plied him with sweets and he was initially delighted when . they said they planned to bring him an extra-special gift – a suicide . vest packed with bullets and grenades. Future threat: Taliban children aged five are pictured being trained to fire guns by extremists in Afghanistan . ‘They . made me try it on. The grenades went all around my body and then they . offered me the coins [50 Afghanis – about 60p],’ he said. ‘They told me . to blow myself up at a checkpoint.

"A solar-powered family car has completed a drive from Los Angeles to San Francisco fuelled entirely by sunshine - a journey covering almost 385 miles (619km). Called Stella, the vehicle can travel up to 500 miles (800 km) on a single charge, clocking speeds of up to 80mph (130 km). The prototype four-seater has solar cells on its roof to provide power while driving, and it boasts a tablet that tracks traffic lights. A lightweight, wedge-shaped electric car called Stella (shown) that charges itself with solar cells on its roof has been built at Eindhoven University. It travels 500 miles (800km) on a single charge at speeds of 80mph (130km/h). This distance is increased if the sun is shining thanks to the array of solar panels on top . The vehicle was created by a group called Solar Tam Eindhoven, based at Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. Stella's recent journey took it up California's scenic Pacific Coast Highway into the centre of L.A. Stella can travel up to 500 miles (800 km) on a single charge, at speeds of 80mph (130 km). The 1.5-kilowatt solar panels on top of the car, which cost about £2,600 ($4,260) to produce, supply power to the car's lithium ion battery . At the back of the car, the panels can be lifted up to reveal a boot, and other novelties include a steering wheel that expands when a user drives too fast, and contracts when they drive too slow. It weighs 855lbs (390kg) and is 15ft (4.6 metres) long, while the body of the vehicle is made of carbon fibre. Its aerodynamic shape also helps to increase its driving range. But the car is less than 4ft (1.2 metres) tall, so getting in is a bit of a squeeze. Stella can even communicate with other cars; during an example, it relayed traffic information to a Tesla Model S nearby. And this extends to traffic lights as well - a tablet screen in the car will tell the driver how long until a light up ahead turns red or green. And the creators of Stella hope their vehicle might one day enter mass production, and become a common sight on roads.

Its aerodynamic shape also helps to increase its driving range. But it is less than 4ft (1.2 metres) tall, so getting in is a bit of a squeeze . 'It was great to see all the people looking at us; hurrying to get their smartphones out to get pictures while we were driving,' said Lex Hoefsloot, manager of Solar Team Eindhoven after the car had undertaken its drive from Los Angeles to San Francisco. In July a team of University of New South Wales students broke a 26-year-old world record for speed, which would make their solar car the fastest electric vehicle to travel 500km on a single battery charge. The car, which was built by Australia's top solar car racing team - UNSW's Sunswift - was able to travel at an average speed of more than 100km/h, beating the previous world record of 73km/h. The world record was broken on a 2.6 miles (4.2km) circular race track in Geelong - south-west of Melbourne - in Victoria at the Australian Automotive Research Centre. The vehicle to smash the record, eVe, was the fifth one built and raced by Sunswift since the team was founded in 1996. 'I think we caused some traffic jams and we were worried some drivers might run into us while trying to take pictures.' Hoefsloot is one of the students at Eindhoven University of Technology who designed and built Stella in what grew into a school-wide project that won a World Solar Car challenge race across Australia in 2013. Stella launched a US tour in Detroit at the Intelligent Transportation Society World Congress in early September. The team drove to San Francisco to join sponsor NXP Semiconductors of The Netherlands in an event focused on a future in which roads are made safer and air pollution reduced by cars that 'talk' to one another as well as traffic signals. 'We think it is possible to make these cars and have them in a showroom in five to 10 years, but it is a big dream and something we have to really work on,' said Hoefsloot. The technology in Stella is not new and if the solar cars were mass-produced like gas-guzzling models they could be similarly affordable, according to the student. But big auto-makers have had little contact with the team because 'they think it is too far-fetched,' Hoefsloot told AFP. 'We think otherwise, of course,' he said. 'It is the first family car that is powered by solar energy, it just doesn't have a family yet.' Stella also has a steering wheel (pictured) that expands if a users drive too fast, and or contracts if they go too slow.

"When they married to great fanfare and with much opulence in an Italian castle in November 2006, talk not only centered on bride Katie Holmes' wedding dress but also on her prenuptial agreement with the groom. The details? For each year the couple stay married, the Dawson's Creek actress collects $3million - to a maximum of $33 million after 11 years - as well as their palatial home in California. If their marriage had lasted more than 11 years, Holmes would have received half of Cruises’s reportedly $250 million fortune. After filing for divorce less than six years later, according to the agreement, Katie should only be entitled to $15 million as well as the couple's $35 million Beverly Hills Mansion. Split: After five years of marriage, Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes are set to engage in a messy divorce with speculation as to how much of the Cruise estate Katie is entitled to . Autos: The $1.5million Veyron - which the couple arrived to the Mission Impossible premiere in - features a 16 cylinder engine, The engine is fed by four turbochargers and displaces 7,993 cubic centimeters . But with an estate worth upwards of $275 million, Katie is expected to seek much more and there is already intense speculation as to how much she will collect when the papers are signed. Because the couple lived in Beverly Hills, . California law will be applied to the separation of assets. California . is a community property state, so normally a couple's assets must be . split evenly in divorce. Any money earned would be split 50/50 as would . any debt either Tom or Katie incurred during their marriage. But the prenuptial agreement signed before they tied the knot in 2006 will change all that. Source: Criminal Law News . Sources reveal the 33-year-old is asking for a 'suitable amount' of child support, as well as a division of property, though no mention was made of the prenuptial agreement in divorce papers. After Katie's lawyer announced her client was filing for divorce, representatives for Tom, 49, released a statement saying he was 'very sad' and 'did not see this coming'. Since they did not stay married for 11 years, the prenuptial agreement explicitly states that California community property laws won't apply to the divorce - which normally sees a couple's assets split 50/50. When the divorce is eventually finalized, each will keep their respective earnings from the projects they've worked on since November 2006. That's in addition to the $3 million per year Cruise will give to Holmes. There were also rumors that a certain degree of 'nastiness' was involved, evidenced by Katie's intent to seek sole custody of Suri. If she succeeds in this, the child support payments Tom will have to pay for his daughter could prove sizeable. New York divorce attorney Vikki Ziegler told Hollywood Life that . because of the prenup, Katie stands to lose millions and will need to . use their six-year-old daughter as a pawn to get more money. 'Most of the estate is Tom's. She’ll have to go for a . lot of child support,' she said. 'She’ll have to show that Suri has nannies, cars, . activities, clothes, hair appointments. That a hefty amount each month . is needed to maintain Suri’s lifestyle.' Home number one: Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes paid about $35 million for this Beverly Hills mansion sprawled over 10,286 square feet which Katie is said to be entitled to in the prenuptial agreement . Their country house in Sussex, England: The home features six bedrooms, an indoor swimming pool, underground garage, a sports pavilion, a game room, greenhouse, high tech security system and a staff cottage is worth $4.75million . Part-time homes: A $7million villa in Italy's Lake Como, left, and a luxury Manhattan apartment add to the couple's multimillion dollar estate . TMZ.com have today reported that Katie filed divorce documents in New York because the courts look on sole custody more favourably than in California. But sources told the gossip site that Cruise is trying to avoid ties with the city because of the high tax rates and he doesn't want to let on that he and Katie have been living there. TMZ however, claims it has obtained documents which show that Cruise deeded their Manhattan apartment to Katie last August specifically for tax purposes and she is using the apartment to establish residency in New York for the purpose of the divorce. Shortly after they married in 2006, the couple paid $30million for a lavish nine-bedroom home on a Telluride, Colorado, estate which they were later rumored to have added a $10 million bunker to. They also own a lavish apartment in New York's Manhattan, where Katie is currently said to be holed up with the couple's daughter Suri, while Tom films his new movie Oblivion in Iceland. A $5 million home in Sussex, England, which features six bedrooms, an indoor swimming pool, . underground garage, sports pavilion, high . tech security system and staff cottage as well as villa in Italy's Lake Como bought from friend George Clooney for almost $7 million adds to the couple's multimillion dollar estate. The Mission Impossible actor likes to indulge in a number of expensive hobbies and has over the years collected three aircrafts, several cars and a 60-foot yacht. After the couple married, the actor bought Katie a luxurious wedding gift in the form of a Gulfstream IV-SP, about which she famously said: 'It's like a bus, only quicker.' Boats: The couple and daughter Suri took many expensive vacations during their five-year marriage including time spent on their own 'Little Castle' 60ft power yacht . Splash the cash: Daughter Suri is believed to own a $3million designer wardrobe . Motorcycle: Tom Cruise and actress Katie Holmes arrive on a motorbike at a special fan screening of War of the Worlds at the Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood June 27, 2005 . Cruise also owns a luxurious airplane Aviat – Pitts S-2B and a North American Aviation P-51 Mustang. The jet has painted on one of it's side 'Kiss Me, Kate'. As well as aircrafts, Tom has a number of sports cars in his possession - a Porsce 911 and a 16-cylinder V8. The couple lived in Beverly Hills so California law would have been applied to the separation of assets. California is a community property state, so normally a couple's assets must be split evenly in divorce.

"Thierry Henry has given Alexis Sanchez the ultimate endorsement by declaring the Chilean his long-awaited successor at Arsenal. Sanchez’s exhilarating start to life in the Barclays Premier League has been one of the themes of the season and Henry saw at first hand on Sunday, in the 3-0 demolition of Stoke City, just how much the Emirates Stadium reveres the forward. His deadly finishing, electrifying change of pace and raw power have led to comparisons with Henry, the greatest striker in the club’s history. And the Frenchman believes the comparisons are justified. Alexis Sanchez celebrates after scoring Arsenal's second goal against Stoke City on Sunday . Thierry Henry celebrates his winner for Arsenal against Leeds United in the FA Cup in January 2012 . Arsenal have had good forwards since Henry left for Barcelona in 2007 — not least Robin van Persie — but Sanchez is threatening to be truly exceptional and Henry, who scored 228 times for the club, believes manager Arsene Wenger now has another figure with the X-factor. Henry, who will begin his new career as a Sky analyst on Sunday, said: ‘Arsenal were looking for a player to deliver on a daily basis and they have found one. He is brilliant. He can read the game incredibly, as you saw with the goal on Sunday, and his work-rate is fantastic. ‘He scores goals and doesn’t need a lot of opportunities to put the ball in the net. That is very important. ‘He is a very, very good player and you know that if he is on tune, then Arsenal have a lot of chances to win the game. I am trying to think if there has been a better signing in the last five or six years. It is still early days but so far it is very good. He is doing extremely well. He is going to score goals but it is his all-round game that I am so impressed with. That has no price. Sanchez advances with the ball as Arsenal comfortably see off Stoke City at the Emirates on Sunday . Henry waves to the crowd from his box in the stands as he watches the Stoke match alongside Robert Pires . ‘Arsenal fans have been waiting to have a player like that. Finally they have one. He struggled at the beginning, like everybody, but when he got into a rhythm, you can see the quality. We should all be happy with him. He is going to be a great player for many years.’ The question now, though, is focused on the quality around him. Wenger may have finally been able to put Sanchez, Mesut Ozil and Theo Walcott on a pitch for the first time on Sunday but are Arsenal in danger of becoming too reliant on their £35million striker? ‘No,’ Henry replied bluntly. ‘In some of the games when he hasn’t appeared, Arsenal have won them. Sanchez didn’t have a great game against West Ham — and they won. He didn’t have a great game against QPR — and they won. So there you go.’ Sanchez jumps in the air after scoring for Arsenal against Stoke City in the Premier League clash . Sanchez (left) has an unsuccessful shot towards goal as Arsenal go on to win 3-0 against Stoke . That might be true but Henry accepted that when he was the spearhead of one of the greatest teams English football has seen, quality and support were all around him. This squad need to show they have the class to dispel the doubts. ‘It has to be a team effort,’ he said. ‘They don’t seem so far away. Having said that, they are still some distance from the first spot. It is going to take a team effort to get there.’ Henry was in Zurich on Monday for the Ballon D’Or award ceremony, an event that seemed to have more glitz and sparkle than a Hollywood premiere. His main duty was to hand over the trophy to Cristiano Ronaldo. On the subject of Hollywood, talk inevitably turned to Steven Gerrard’s imminent move to LA Galaxy. A four-year stint in MLS with New York Red Bulls leaves Henry well placed to explain what the Liverpool captain can expect in California. Henry (right) shakes hands with Cristiano Ronaldo at the Ballon d'Or awards ceremony on Monday night . Henry signs autographs for fans as he arrives at the Kongresshaus in Zurich on Monday . ‘He will arrive in a team that is already on tune,’ said Henry. ‘They have either been winning or losing in the final every year and are a very good organisation.’ With that, Henry was ready to sweep out of Kongresshaus but not before he had delivered a message to the Arsenal fans who lambasted Wenger on a train platform after the defeat at Stoke.

"The United States helped Saddam Hussein attack Iran with chemical weapons in the 1980s during the Iran-Iraq war, it has been claimed. Ronald Regan's administration, who supported the Iraqi dictator topple two decades later by the Bush government, fed information to Baghdad that helped them launch strikes. U.S. officials gave Saddam's army details about the whereabouts of Iranian forces in 1988 knowing that he would deploy chemical weapons, Foreign Policy magazine reported. Forces: Iraqi soldiers seen in 1980 at the start of the eight-year conflict with Iran. An estimated 20,000 Iranian troops were gassed to death . 'Support': Secret documents reveal that former President Ronald Reagan's administration acquiesced in Iraq's use of chemical weapons . Iraq used mustard gas and sarin in early 1988 in four major offensives which helped bring about the end of the eight-year conflict. During the whole war, up to 20,000 Iranian troops were killed by mustard gas and nerve agents from Iraq and 100,000 were wounded. They were able to launch the strikes after being given maps, satellite pictures and other intelligence by the U.S. The Americans have always said that Iraq did not reveal that they would launch chemical strikes. But documents released in the National Archives and interviews with former serviceman show that the U.S. acquiesced in the use of chemical weapons as they tried to help Saddam with the war . Retired Air Force Colonel Rick Francona, a military attache who was working in Baghdad in 1988, told Foreign Police magazine said that they knew what Saddam was planning. 'The Iraqis never told us that they intended to use nerve gas. They didn't have to. We already knew,"" he told Foreign Policy. Official documents revealed that the U.S. officials were given detailed information about the use of nerve gas by the Iraqis during the conflict. They indicate that the Americans knew more about Saddam's use of chemical weapons than previously thought. The CIA's Director of Central Intelligence William J Casey was given detailed intelligence about the efforts of Iraqi chemical weapons plants to produce mustard gas for troops. Dictator: The U.S. supported Saddam Hussein during the war Iraq-Iran war. Two decades later, he was captured by U.S. troops after being felled . The cache of newly-released documents also revealed that the Americans feared the Iranians may launch terror strikes against the U.S. around the world if they had evidence to suggest the Ronald Reagan's administration acquiesced in Saddam's use of chemical weapons. One secret document from September 1984, headed 'The Islamic bomb: Chemical rather than nuclear?', revealed the scale of Iraq's chemical weapons programme. It said: 'Iraq has over the last several years developed a substantial CW (chemical weapons) production capability. Conflict: Iranian soldiers praying during operation Nasser VII, northwest of the Irano-Iraqi front in August 1987 . 'CIA presently estimates that Iraq is capable of producing at least two tons per day of the nerve agent.' Another document, marked 'Top Secret' from January 1985, indicated that the Iraqis would use chemical weapons against Iran. It said: 'The Iraqis have used chemical weapons in three separate battles beginning in August 1983 and will use chemical weapons on a wide scale in the event of another major Iranian attack.' The Geneva Protocol of 1925, which the Americans had ratified in 1975, states undertake that they will not use chemical weapons and agree they 'will exert every effort to induce other States' to do the same. The CIA have not responded to a request for comment from MailOnline.","U.S. fed intelligence to Iraq about whereabouts of Iranian forces .

"Pop sensation Justin Bieber is 'heartbroken' after his pet monkey was seized by customs officials - because the Baby singer demanded Mally accompany him on a long-haul flight to Germany. Canadian Bieber's increasingly bizarre behaviour is concerning aides after he insisted Mally travelled on his private jet - even though he had no paperwork to show to customs officials in Munich. According to sources the 19-year-old, who had travelled from LA to Munich, was 'detained for some time' by furious customs officers who demanded to see a health certificate for the monkey - which Justin could not provide. Scroll down for video . Monkey business: Justin Bieber's beloved monkey Mally has been seized by customs officials after the star allegedly demanded to travel into the EU with his pet . Mally is now in quarantine and teen idol Justin could face prosecution from German authorities and a £10,000 fine. A source told The Sun: 'He and Mally go everywhere together. He will be heartbroken. 'Justin has been acting like a right diva. He is out of control and lives in an alternative reality to the rest of us.' The friend likened capuchin monkey Mally, who was given to Justin as a birthday present from music producer Jamal Racshid, to Michael Jackson's beloved pet Bubbles - who accompanied the tragic singer to a number of concerts. Primate pals: Justin went in to perform on stage at the Olympiahalle  in Munich as Mally stayed in quarantine at the star's expense . Seized: Customs officials at Munich Franz Josef Strauss Airport (pictured) took Mally into quarantine after discovering Justin didn't have the right paperwork . Customs officials in Germany demand to see detailed paperwork from pet owners, especially if the flight originated from outside the EU. Justin has been on a hectic schedule, going from Poland to LA on Monday in his luxury Cessna Citation, and then onto Munich on Thursday. It is thought the Boyfriend singer travelled on to Austria by bus - but without his beloved pet. The superstar denied he was having a breakdown after he kept fans waiting for two hours at the O2 in London and then went on to swear at photographer in a bizarre rant. Snappy at a snapper: Justin Bieber fuelled speculation over his bizarre behaviour after this altercation with a photographer . It is thought the 'Beauty and the Beat' hitmaker used his ex Selena Gomez to keep him on the straight and narrow and without her guidance he hasn't been able to keep himself grounded. A source revealed how the star has been reliving his 2011 appearance as the host 'Saturday Night Live' by replaying the tape - along with his own videos - to his entourage on the tour bus . HollywoodLife.com were told: 'It's so awkward. I mean Justin did a good job on the show, but no one wants to watch it again and again. Good influence: Since Justin split from long-term love Selena Gomez friends say he has gone off the rails . 'Being stuck on the bus for hours on end is bad enough without having to watch Justin do his monologue again and again, but no one says anything. 'Selena used to tell him what was up and it must have helped keep him grounded, because since they broke up his ego is out of control.' The insider explained Justin doesn't act quite as cocky when he's around people he respects, but his entourage don't want to speak out. Pet: Michael Jackson with his beloved Bubbles - since being given his pet monkey Bieber is thought to be rarely apart from Mally . They added: 'He never pulls that kind of stuff when Jayden [Smith] or someone else he respects is there, but when it's just his people on the bus he does it. 'He does the same thing with his videos. He'll have them running on a loop, and then when he sees a part he loves, he stops and rewinds it and makes everyone watch. 'No one is into it. They all want to play video games or watch movies, not watch Justin! But they all pretend they love it as much as he does. Everyone there is pretty much on the payroll so they all just kiss his ass, and tell him how much they love watching him and his videos.'","Justin could face prosecution and a £10,000 fine after arriving in Munich with no paperwork for Mally the monkey .

"Ben Ridd, then 13, suffered catastrophic brain damage  in a 2005 boat race, but showed his fighting spirit when he carried the Olympic torch in 2012 . A boy who nearly died after a powerboat crash was spied on for six years before the Royal Yachting Association agreed to pay him compensation, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Ben Ridd, then 13, suffered catastrophic brain damage when a rival boat – driven by an 11-year-old novice – ploughed into his craft at 30mph during a race. The impact ripped off Ben's helmet and fractured his skull, leaving him in a coma for three weeks. An investigation into the race in 2005, which had been authorised by the Royal Yachting Association (RYA), found that warnings about the safety of the boat design had been ignored. The RYA finally admitted liability after a legal battle lasting years and last week agreed to pay Ben, now 23, £5.5 million compensation. The money will go into a trust to pay for his lifetime care. During the case, it emerged that Ben had been secretly filmed by investigators who wanted to assess the extent of his disability. The 20 hours of footage has now been seen by the Ridds and their solicitors. They say it shows investigators following Ben from his house, on his way to school and even on a coach trip to London to buy Christmas presents. The family says the videos show Ben from when he was about 15 until he was about 21. Ben said: 'I couldn't believe it when I learned they'd been spying on me for years but I'm pleased it's all over. I just want to be normal.' His mother Leanne added: 'If they had done the decent thing and paid up immediately, we would have been able to give Ben the very best care immediately and he might not be as disabled as he is now.' The RYA – whose patron is the Queen – last night described the surveillance as 'standard practice'. A spokesman explained that the decisions about the handling of the claim were made by their insurers at the time, Navigators. He said: 'Between the reporting of the incident to Navigators in 2005 and their decision to admit liability on behalf of the RYA in October 2012, Navigators effectively excluded the RYA from all decision-making in relation to the conduct of the claim.' Mr Ridd, now 23, before the crash which had been authorised by the Royal Yachting Association (RYA) He has now been handed £5.5million in compensation from the RYA, pictured with his mother Leanne . Ben was injured in a K-200 class Junior Offshore National Championship race for under-16s off Portland, Dorset, in June, 2005. The crash happened when he rounded the first buoy and came to a sudden stop, and a pursuing powerboat crashed into him. Ben was left in a coma. At one point, doctors feared he would die and asked his family to say their final goodbyes. It took him six months to recover the power of speech and he was in hospital for a total of nine months. He is partially paralysed down his left side, has slurred speech and suffers from acute memory loss. He will need full-time care for the rest of his life. He can walk only with a stick, for just minutes at a time. The initial report by the Government's Marine Accident Investigation Branch in 2005 was so damning that the RYA cancelled head-to-head powerboat racing for children under 12s. The impact of the accident ripped off Mr Ridd's helmet and fractured his skull, leaving him in a coma for three weeks, pictured in hospital with his father . Investigators said: 'The RYA also paid little attention to a letter and enclosed safety assessment which were sent to the organisation in 2004 by the boat's original designer, in which he warned of the dangers associated with the sort of accident that occurred.' Welcoming the settlement, Leanne added: 'This isn't a lottery win. We will need this money – and more – to make sure Ben is looked after for the rest of his life.' Ben showed his fighting spirit when he was an Olympic torch bearer in 2012. He left home 18 months ago but cannot drive and is dependent on carers. He works part-time at a Salvation Army shop. The future of the RYA, which made a £161,000 loss last year, is unclear. It faces a bill for legal costs that could run to millions. RYA chief executive Sarah Treseder said: 'Lessons have been learned and safety improvements implemented. We extend our best wishes to Ben and his family.' Navigators did not respond to a request for comment.","Ben Ridd, then 13, suffered catastrophic brain damage in a boat race .

"This time last year Arsenal were top of the Premier League table. They added Alexis Sanchez in the summer, who’s been excellent, and now they’re 13 points off top spot, and not even in the top four. Doesn’t make sense does it? I suspect the Gunners will eventually finish in their precious Champions League place. But while one stellar signing every summer – Mesut Ozil in 2013, Sanchez last year – might eventually work over a long period of time, Arsenal fans have waited ages for their manager to get serious in the transfer market, in the title race and in Europe. So maybe Arsenal need to work with more haste. Look away Spurs fans - here's how Gareth Bale would suit the red and white of Arsenal . Alexis Sanchez has been an inspired signing for Arsenal but they remain 13 points adrift of leaders Chelsea . Per Mertesacker (left) and Olivier Giroud can only reach a certain level... Arsenal need more than that . In essence they need to 'sign a spine.' David Ospina might be the long-term solution in goal, if they stick with Laurent Koscielny they will definitely need a world-class centre back alongside him. A top-level defensive midfielder is a must, and so too a world-class striker. Arsenal can keep stumbling along with Per Mertesacker, Francis Coquelin and Olivier Giroud, but on the evidence so far, these players can only reach a certain level. For domination at home and abroad (isn’t that what Arsenal fans want?) the Gunners need to aim high, show some intent and really go for it. But there is one player beyond the spine who could make a massive difference, and signing him would be a huge statement from Arsenal Football Club in so many ways. The Gunners should go for Gareth Bale. Bale jumps for joy after scoring Real Madrid's second goal in their La Liga victory over Espanyol . Bale has come under fire from Real Madrid fans and the media... so, why don't Arsenal make a move for him? Mesut Ozil returned to first-team action for Arsenal in their  win over Stoke at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday . As Bale left Tottenham for Madrid, Ozil arrived at the Emirates and Arsenal fans came up with a mildly amusing song to reflect the contrasting transfer fortunes of the north London rivals. To the tune of the Inspiral Carpets’ 1990 hit 'This is How It Feels,' Gooners sang the words: . 'This is how it feels to be Tottenham, . 'This is how it feels to be small, . 'You sold Bale and we signed Mesut Ozil…' The ditty conveniently ignores that Spurs also signed Christian Eriksen at that time and he turned out (so far) to be far better than Ozil for a fraction of the price. But it’s still funny. Bale in action for Real Madrid in their La Liga clash against Espanyol at the Bernabeu on Saturday . Bale's play is similar to that of Thierry Henry in his pomp, pictured here celebrating against Everton in 2003 . However, Bale is under fire in Spain for shooting too much. Sounds ridiculous, but Real Madrid fans and the media want him to give the ball to Ronaldo more. One accusation levelled at Arsene Wenger’s side is that they don’t shoot enough, they overplay in and around the box. Go to a game at the Emirates and you’ll often hear fans’ frustrations when there’s one pass too many and a promising move breaks down. Gareth Bale’s direct approach is reminiscent of Thierry Henry at his peak at Arsenal. And the pain for Spurs fans of seeing Bale in an Arsenal shirt would be an added bonus for Gooners. It would be brilliant for the Premier League though.","Real Madrid's Gareth Bale is under fire in Spain for shooting too much .

"Weight-loss expert Steve Miller said he wants to see fast food chains ban obese customers to help them shed the pounds . Fast food restaurants should ban obese people from gorging on junk food to shock start their weight loss, an expert said today. Steve Miller, presenter of Fat Families, told MailOnline said his radical idea is not aimed at shaming those who are overweight, but rather at saving lives. He said employees at chains including McDonalds and KFC should be trained to  refuse to serve overweight customers in a delicate but forthright manner. 'There is no doubt fast food restaurants have their regular customers who may at times be significantly obese,' he told MailOnline. 'Common sense would say to us that person eating an absolute load of junk is significantly putting their health at risk. 'Therefore, what I am lobbying fast food restaurants for, is to empower their staff to refuse to serve them.' But he said as part of the overhaul of attitudes he wants to see fast food restaurants introduce healthier options. 'This is not about being cruel,' Mr Miller said. 'It is about saving people's live. 'I know it is radical, however, I am a bit fed up with Government health education. There is so much common sense, but no one seems to own it. 'People need to start owning their own bodies. The only way to reduce obesity is by using shock tactics.' Mr Miller said while radical at its core, his idea does not involve shaming those who are overweight. He has offered his expertise free of charge to any of the fast food giants, who are interested in helping improve the health of their customers. The Fat Families presenter said he would like to see new training programmes introduced for staff of fast food chains, giving them the confidence and compassion to help obese customers. As a trained hypnotherapist, Mr Miller said he would like to help employees learn to use hypnotic language to help obese customers choose healthier options or turn them away all together. He has written to McDonalds' chief executive officer, Jill McDonald, to offer his services, and hopes they will become the first fast food chain in the UK to implement his ideas for a 'fat ban'. Mr Miller said his proposals could shock people into shedding pounds, as they avoid fast food chains or become motivated to lose weight to prevent themselves being turned away. The Fat Families presenter said employees at chains including McDonalds and KFC should be trained to refuse to serve overweight customers in a delicate but forthright manner (file image) 'Overeating is an addiction,' he told MailOnline. 'I am the first person to say food is a drug. 'The vast majority of my clients are addicted to food. And these are the people this new idea could help. 'They are addicted and therefore need help to lose weight. You wouldn't continue to feed a heroin addict heroin, so why continue to allow obese people to eat junk food.' And Mr Miller said eventually he would like to see his idea evolve, to a situation where those fast food chains who refuse to help their customers are penalised. 'In a bar if someone was too drunk then the bartender wouldn't serve them because it's not safe to,' he said. 'It's no different for fat people. Overeating and bingeing on junk food isn't safe especially for people who are already obese. 'There are so many health risks attached to it that in the long run could lead to serious diseases or even early death. 'Like where parents are overfeeding their children, I believe they should be prosecuted, fast food restaurants should face penalties too. Mr Miller has written to McDonald's and hopes they will become the first chain to implement his ideas (file image) Mr Miller blasted retailers for using size 16 mannequins, claiming they 'normalise' obesity . Earlier this year Mr Miller blasted retailers for using size 16 mannequins, claiming they 'normalise' obesity. He told MailOnline that 'political correctness is encouraging people to stay fat'. He urged society to adopt 'shock tactics' to tackle the obesity epidemic head on. In March, Debenhams became the first high street store to introduce the larger mannequins on to the shop floor at their flagship Oxford Street branch in London. They appear alongside size 10 dummies to reflect the shape of 'real women'. Mr Miller said using size 16 mannequins is 'promoting the idea that being fat is acceptable'. He told MailOnline: 'If you start having fat mannequins - and I do call them fat because every size 16 woman I have worked with has been fat - you are putting out the message that it is normal. 'It is very concerning. Using size 16 mannequins is like saying ill health is OK.' 'If we become swamped with these over-sized mannequins we are motivating people to stay fat, it is like saying ""who cares what you look like"".' 'You could do it in a health and safety way, where restaurants get improvement notices if it is found they were not taking responsibility for the health of their customers. 'If that notice is ignored, penalties could be the next option. 'It does all sound radical but it is a serious problem. 'I am serious because we are currently, as a nation, failing to tackle obesity - the meek and mild approach just isn't working. 'In a way this is about being cruel to be kind. It is about helping people take the steps they need to start losing weight and living a healthier lifestyle. 'I am not suggesting we should shame obese people but let's start a discussion with people who do regularly eat fast food and help them make healthier choices.'","Steve Miller, presenter of Sky's Fat Families, says shock tactics are needed to help combat the obesity epidemic .

"An endangered Siberian tiger released into the wild by Vladimir Putin has attacked a hen house in northern China and eaten five chickens. Satellite tracking showed the rare Amur cat swam across a river - evidently in search of a Chinese meal after a shortage of its staple of deer in eastern Russia. The Russians alerted Beijing through diplomatic channels amid fears angry farmers in Heilongjiang province might shoot the tiger which is named Kuzya. Russian president Vladimir Putin works with a conservationist to put a collar on Kuzya who has escaped to northern China where he attacked a hen house and ate five chickens . Kuzya was one of three Siberian tigers released by Putin in a remote part of the Amur region in May . The 19-month-old cub was one of three Siberian tigers released by Putin in a remote part of the Amur region in May. Only Kuzya defected to China. The others remain in Russia according to tracking signals. Kuzya attacked a farm in Heilongjiang province's Luobei county, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. Animal remains were found near the tiger's tracks, and feathers and blood near the smashed henhouse. The big cat was spotted earlier this month in Taipinggou nature reserve in Heilongjiang province and some 60 cameras have been set up in a bid to track him. Chen Zhigang, the nature reserve director, said a Russian expert had alerted him to Kuzya's location and had 'expressed hope that we can protect it'. The Russian's alerted Beijing of Kuzya's border crossing through diplomatic channels . The attack was reported as Putin praised the growing friendship between Russia and its 'natural ally' China. The president told Chinese premier Li Keqiang during talks at the Kremlin.'We are natural partners, natural allies, we are neighbours,' 'We are setting large-scale, absolutely realistic goals for ourselves and no doubt this will serve our peoples well.' Russia is keen to embrace its eastern neighbour because of its plummeting popularity with the West, especially over the Ukraine crisis. It was not immediately clear if Putin  - an avid campaigner to save the endangered species - raised the subject of his rampant tiger during the talks. Putin has called China a 'natural ally' and has been trying to build relations with the country . However, the foreign ministry in Beijing pledged that Kuzya would be protected, citing an existing agreement on cross-border protection of Siberian tigers. 'We will make joint efforts with the Russian side to protect wild Siberian tigers which travel back and forth between China and Russia,' explained spokesman Hong Lei said in a statement. Earlier Russian ecologists expressed fears for the animal in China. Vasiliy Gorobeiko, deputy head of natural resources management in the Jewish Automomous Republic in eastern Russia - where the tiger was roaming before he swam across the Amur River - said China was more populated and he could be shot for worrying farm animals. 'Certainly, China will be informed about President Putin's tiger via Foreign Affairs ministry channels but time is needed for this information to reach local ecologists, and before then the tiger may well alarm the local villagers and may even suffer,' he said at the time. 'Kuzya knows how to avoid people and did so well in Russia but in that agricultural area of China, it will be hard for him.' 'We can only hope that Kuzya changes his mind and swims back to Russia as soon as possible, while the river is not iced over,' said Novaya Gazeta newspaper in covering the animal's defection to China. The Siberian tiger, also known as Amur tiger, is on the Red List of Threatened Species. In 2010, Russia launched a national strategy to protect the Siberian tiger, the largest of the five tiger species. According to World Wildlife Fund, some 450 Siberian tigers left on the planet. Putin was recently behind the unveiling of a computer animated tiger cub as a new character on Russia's longest-running children's TV programme.","Kuzya was one of three Siberian tigers released by Putin in May .

"An Indian court on Saturday sentenced six men convicted of the gang rape of a Swiss woman to life in prison, in one of several recent cases that have fuelled a public outcry over the high rate of sex crimes in India. The 39-year-old Swiss woman was raped while camping with her husband in a forest in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh in mid-March. 'It was a good judgment. It came early,' said Rajendra Tiwari, a lawyer for the government. The attack, which took place in the state of Madhya Pradesh (pictured), involved six men attacking a Swiss woman . The woman had previously asked judges trying her six attackers not to impose the death penalty. Judges in Daita, central India, . opened the case with four of the six charged with rape and . the other two facing assault and robbery charges. The court heard that the 39-year-old . victim and her husband had been on a cycling holiday in Madhya Pradesh . state when their camp was attacked by the gang. After beating and tying up her 30-year-old husband, the gang pinned down and raped his terrified wife, said prosecutors. The National Crime Records Bureau says more than 24,200 rapes were reported across India in 2011 - about one every 20 minutes. Police estimate only four out of 10 rapes are reported, largely due to victims' fear of being shamed by their families and communities. A new law has been passed following nationwide  protests sparked by the fatal gang rape of a young woman on a bus in New Delhi . The gang rape of a 23-year-old woman . on a bus on December 16 in New Delhi sparked a global outcry over the . issue and brought thousands of people onto the streets to demand better . policing to prevent sex crimes. The trainee physiotherapist later died . from her injuries. It . brought hundreds of thousands of angry citizens out in the streets to . demand more safety for women and harsher laws to deter the perpetrators . of such acts. An American tourist was gang-raped by . a group of men in a hill resort in northern India in June. In March, a . British woman jumped out of her hotel balcony in Uttar Pradesh state to . escape a feared sexual assault. Outrage: The brutal attack at the end of last year sent shock waves across India . India has seen a sharp fall in the numbers of foreign tourists, especially women, since the high-profile rape and murder of a young woman in New Delhi in December. In . the three months since that attack, the number of foreigners travelling . to India has dropped by 25 per cent, according to the the New . Delhi-based Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry. The number of women tourists has dropped by 35 per cent, the study released last night said. The study . surveyed 1,200 tour operators from across the country who said that . 'concerns about the safety of female travelers' had impacted how foreign . travelers viewed India. Since the December gang rape there . have been two widely publicised incidents where foreign female . travellers have been attacked.","39-year-old Swiss woman was raped while camping with her husband .

Then he goes to work with a black pencil, highlighting his eyebrows until they're thicker, bolder. ‘Having a clean, neat face makes you look sophisticated and creates an image that you can handle yourself well,’ the 24-year-old college student said. ‘Your appearance matters, so when I wear makeup on special occasions, it makes me more confident.’ Mirror, mirror: Cho Won-Hyuk, a 24-year-old college student, uses a black eyebrow pencil to accentuate his eyebrows at his home in Anyang, South Korea . Inspiration: A man walks by an advertisement featuring Jang Keun-suk, a South Korean celebrity often given the title 'flower man' by news media in Seoul, an inspiration to the modern South Korean man . Cho's meticulous efforts to paint the . perfect face are not unusual in South Korea. This socially conservative, . male-dominated country, with a mandatory two-year military conscription . for men, has become the male makeup capital of the world. South Korean men spent £305.6 million ($495.5 million) on skincare last year, accounting for nearly 21 percent of global . sales, according to global market research firm Euromonitor . International. That makes it the largest market for . men's skincare in the world, even though there are only about 19 million . men in South Korea. Amorepacific, South Korea's biggest . cosmetics company, estimates the total sales of men's cosmetics in South . Korea this year will be more than £544.5 million ($885 million). Facial care: Cho Won-Hyuk shops for beauty products, not an unusual sight in modern day South Korea which has become the male makeup capital in the world . The metamorphosis of South Korean men from macho to makeup over the last decade or so can be partly explained by fierce competition for jobs, advancement and romance in a society where, as a popular catchphrase puts it, ‘appearance is power.’ Women also have a growing expectation that men will take the time and effort to pamper their skin. Evidence of this new direction in South Korean masculinity is easy to find. In a crowded Seoul cafe, a young woman takes some lipstick out of her purse and casually applies it to her male companion's lips as they talk. At an upscale apartment building, a male security guard watches the lobby from behind a layer of makeup. Korean Air holds once-a-year makeup classes for male flight attendants. 'I can understand why girls don't like to go outside without makeup — it makes a big difference,' said Cho Gil-nam, a tall, stocky 27-year-old insurance fraud investigator in Seoul who starts important days by dabbing on makeup after finishing his multistep morning cleansing and moisturizing routine. He carries a multicolored cosmetics pouch so he can touch up in public bathrooms throughout the day. While U.S. cosmetics companies report . growing sales in male cosmetics, American men are often wary of makeup. ‘Men Wearing Makeup a Disturbing Trend’ was how American columnist Jim . Shea titled a recent post. In . South Korea, however, effeminate male beauty is ‘a marker of social . success,’ according to Roald Maliangkay, head of Korean studies at . Australian National University. 'Appearance is power': A man receives advice on skincare products at a cosmetics store in Seoul . Amorepacific Corp. offers 17 men's brands, with dozens of products to choose from, and operates two Manstudio stores in Seoul that are devoted to men's skincare and makeup. South Korean men are barraged daily with messages in popular media suggesting that flawless skin is a crucial part of any plan to get ahead at work and romance. ‘In this society, people's first impressions are very important. A man's skin is a big part of that impression, so I take care of my skin,’ said Kim Deuk-ryong, a 20-year-old student. It wasn't always this way. The ideal South Korean man used to be rough and tough. Things began to change in the late 1990s, when the South Korean government relaxed a ban on Japanese cultural goods, exposing South Koreans to different ideas on male beauty, including popular comics featuring pretty, effeminate men. James Turnbull, a writer and lecturer . on Korean feminism, sexuality and popular culture, said the economic . crisis that hit South Korea in 1997 and 1998 also played a role in . shifting thinking. Struggling . companies often fired their female employees first, angering women who . had already seen their push for equal rights take a backseat to protest . movements against Japanese colonizers and the autocratic governments . that followed. ‘The times . were ripe for a sea-change in the popular images of men in the media,’ Turnbull said. Women, as a result, began questioning the kinds of men . society told them they should find attractive. Beautified: Cho Gil-nam starts his day with a makeup routine and says it makes a big difference . Keeping up appearances: Cho Gil-nam carries make up with him so he can improve his looks throughout his day . In 2002, large numbers were attracted to a hero of South Korea's World Cup soccer team, Ahn Jung-hwan, who became a leading member of the so-called ‘flower men’ — a group of exceptionally good-looking, smooth-skinned, fashionable sports stars and celebrities who found great success selling male cosmetics. Men everywhere began striving to look like them, with the encouragement of the women around them, and a trend was born. A decade later, ads featuring handsome, heavily made-up male celebrities are an unavoidable part of the urban scenery. Kim Jong-hoon, a 27-year-old tech industry worker in Paju, said the endless media exposure to famous men with perfect skin helped steer his progression from soap and water to an elaborate regime that includes as many as eight steps, from cleanser to eye cream and lotion to a small amount of makeup powder. ‘My skin wasn't bad, but the media constantly sends the message that skin is one of the most important things, so I wanted to take care of it,’ Kim said. Once an oddity, men using makeup is now commonplace. It's also a good source of conversation, said Kim Ae-kyung, 35, a female office worker. ‘I feel like I have more to talk about with guys who use makeup — we have more in common,’ Kim said.","South Korean men spend more on skin product than any other male population in the world .

"A pregnant mother who didn't realise she was expecting gave birth on her bathroom floor in the middle of the night - while her partner slept through it all. Nadia Watson, 22, of Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, woke up suffering from what she thought were period pains but collapsed to the floor and went into labour. She screamed in agony for more than an hour as she delivered 7lbs 11oz baby Poppy by herself. Nadia Watson with her baby daughter Poppy McSweeney, 11 months, at home in Somerset . But boyfriend Lewis McSweeney didn't wake up - even though she shrieked so loudly her concerned neighbours dialled 999. A fleet of police cars and ambulances arrived minutes after the birth and Lewis, also 22, only arose from his slumber when Nadia presented their newborn daughter. Nadia said: 'He can literally sleep through anything - fire alarms, the lot. I have no idea how he does it. 'I went into our bedroom after I had given birth and showed Lewis the baby but he just went back to sleep. 'I woke him up again and he realised what had happened and he was completely in shock.' Nadia had a rare undiagnosed pregnancy and was unaware she was carrying a child - she gained very little weight and remained a size ten throughout. Nadia (left) with a friend. At the time this picture was taken Nadia was eight months pregnant but had no idea . Poppy McSweeney in hospital after birth. Nadia's boyfriend Lewis sleep through the whole thing . She had two retail jobs - at Frankie and Benny's restaurant and Blockbuster video - and would even help her pregnant neighbour carry her shopping. 'It was a complete surprise - I didn't have a clue that I was pregnant,' she said. 'I was still having regular periods, I remained a size ten, and I only put on a tiny bit of weight which I put down to eating too many burgers at my new job at Frankie and Benny's. 'On the Sunday night I started having some sharp pains, which I just assumed was me starting my period. 'I went to the bathroom and collapsed with pain. I realised I was in labour and just decided to keep pushing. 'Most people have a team of people around them telling them what to do and when but I just had to keep pushing on my own.' Boyfriend Lewis remained completely . oblivious as to what was going on in the next room  - despite . Nadia screaming so loudly the neighbours called the police. She added: 'Lewis just slept through . the whole thing but I did manage to wake the neighbours. I was screaming . so loudly that they called 999. 'By . the time Lewis had woken up two police cars arrived with three . paramedics, so they cut the cord and took us both to hospital.' Baby Poppy was aptly named due to her arrival on Remembrance Sunday last year. 'When . Poppy was born she was completely silent which absolutely terrified me . but then she wiggled and I was just completely relieved,' said Nadia. Poppy McSweeney with her mother Nadia Watson (r) who stayed a size 10 while pregnant . 'Even now she's still really well behaved, she sleeps right through the night and she's a very calm little baby. ' New dad Lewis McSweeney said he was 'quite embarrassed' to have slept through his daughter's birth - but he was exhausted from working night shifts. He said: 'I'm actually quite embarrassed and a little bit gutted at the fact I managed to sleep through the whole thing. 'It's really not unusual for me to sleep through things - I once left a pizza in the oven for more than an hour and didn't wake up to the fire alarm or the neighbours trying to get into the house. 'I had also just finished a 12 hour night shift as a support worker so I was pretty knackered. 'The first thing I knew about Nadia giving birth was when she walked into the room with Poppy in her arms and the chord still attached. 'I thought I was dreaming so I put my head back down and went to sleep but then the penny dropped as to what had happened. 'I was in complete shock for days - I couldn't get my head around what had happened. 'I'd been to have my hair cut the same day and the barber there had just got his misses pregnant. 'I was laughing a bit and telling him that I wouldn't be becoming a Dad for at least 10 years, then less than 12 hours later I had a baby.' His partner Nadia Watson said she had no idea she was pregnant and the only symptom was back ache which she put down to juggling two jobs. She said: 'I think on reflection I was really lucky with my pregnancy - I didn't have any of the usual symptoms and managed to get away with it quite lightly. 'Looking back the only symptom I did have was bad back pains, but I just assumed that it was because I was working two jobs - both of which involved me being on my feet all day. 'One of my friends is pregnant now and she is really suffering with it, so I'm definitely extremely lucky.' Nadia added that she remembers very little about the labour. She said: 'I know I went into labour in the early hours of the morning on Remembrance Sunday but in all honesty I really couldn't tell you much about it - it seemed to happen so quickly. 'I think the labour lasted about an hour, it was definitely no more than two, it was very quick in comparison to some people. 'I know the ambulance turned up and cut the cord at about 7.15 but other than that I haven't really got a clue about timings. 'I was in so much pain I couldn't get up to go and get my phone to check the time or call for help.'It's a bit sad really that I don't actually know what time Poppy was born.'","Nadia Watson, 22, stayed slim throughout pregnancy .

"Shrien Dewani chose to go shopping instead of attending a Hindu ceremony to bless his murdered wife's body, his trial was told. A court heard that Dewani told police officers that he would rather go to a shopping mall in Cape Town than attend the ceremony with his father and Anni Dewani's father, just hours before they flew back to Britain. Dewani's lawyer told the court in Cape Town that the shopping trip was to buy thank you cards for staff at the hotel, as well as police officers. Scroll down for video . Shrien Dewani (left) chose to go shopping rather than attend a Hindu ceremony to bless his murdered wife's body, his trial heard today . Shrien Dewani chose to go shopping rather than attend the ceremony with his father, Prakash Dewani (right), and Anni Dewani's father, Vinod Hindocha (left) He then gave the cards and cash to thank police and hotel staff for looking after him in the days after his wife's murder on their honeymoon, the Telegraph reported. It is alleged that Dewani, a bisexual entrepreneur from Westbury-on-Trym, near Bristol, arranged the murder of his wife Anni. But Dewani has pleaded not guilty to murder, kidnap, robbery, conspiracy to commit these crimes and defeating the ends of justice at Western Cape High Court in Cape Town. Yesterday new videos released by prosecutors showed Zola Tongo, who has been convicted of killing Anni Dewani, and Shrien Dewani meeting on the morning after the murder. The two men were pictured in a quiet sitting area of the five-star Cape Grace hotel. Dewani has yet to hear that the body of his wife, Anni, has been found with a fatal gunshot wound to her neck, in the back of Zola's abandoned taxi. Tongo, who claims Dewani hired him to organise her is sitting on the sofa. Dewani, 34, paces the room, his phone in his hand and is seen speaking to a hotel cleaner who is polishing the window of a door and – according to Tongo – asks him to give them 'some privacy'. The wealthy businessman gives the departing cleaner a grateful smile. The men continue to talk, while unshaven Dewani remains standing – Tongo told the court that Dewani repeatedly asked if he had heard whether the job 'has been done'. CCTV footage showed Shrien Dewani speaking to taxi driver Zola Tongo (bottom left), who is serving an 18-year term for killing Anni Dewani . After a short time, Zola said he warned Dewani that a security camera was trained on the area and Dewani is seen in the film to suddenly snap his head back to look at a camera high in the corner of the room. He swiftly moves towards the corner of the room, beneath the camera, and out of sight, before leaving the room. Tongo stays on at the hotel and Dewani returns to talk to him, again asking whether there is any news about the success of 'the job', according to Tongo’s evidence. As Dewani continues to pace nervously, and according to Tongo, he talks about the previous night’s fake carjacking which ended with the Swedish bride being driven off into the night by two armed men and speculating about whether his wife is dead or not. At one point during the conversation, captured on the Cape Grace hotel’s security camera, Tongo claims he warned Dewani about police officers who were gathered just a few metres away, on the other side of the door, by pointing in their direction. A cleaner can been seen on the right hand side of the frame. He exchanges a few words with Dewani and then appears to make his excuses and leave. Tongo told the court earlier this week that Dewani asked the cleaner to give them some privacy and then asked 'if the job was done', allegedly a reference to a pre-arranged 'hit'. Dewani exchanges a few words with a cleaner, seen on the right hand side of the frame, who then appears to make his excuses and leave . But Dewani insisted he did not know his new wife was dead at this point and was just having a friendly conversation. As there is no sound on the copy it is difficult to know exactly what was said. The driver claims he warned Dewani during the conversation that there were cameras pointed at them. At this point Dewani can be seen looking up at the camera then quickly looking away. Dewani has denied knowing anything about a plot to kill his new bride and said they were hijacked as Tongo was driving them through Gugulethu township in his minibus on November 13. Dewani insisted he did not know his new wife was dead at this point and was just having a conversation . The driver claimed he warned Dewani during the conversation that there were cameras pointed at them . On Wednesday, Dewani's lawyers claimed the millionaire had been framed for the murder of his wife by his driver and two hitmen after a kidnap and ransom plan turned sour. In a dramatic twist to the murder hearing, Dewani's senior lawyer told the court a convicted murderer would be called as a witness to describe how Zola Tongo boasted of making Dewani a scapegoat. Tongo, allegedly told  the 'lifer' that a plan to kidnap Mrs Dewani, 28, and demand a ransom from her wealthy husband ended in murder when one of her two kidnappers attempted to rape her, the court heard. Bernard Mitchell claimed that Tongo confessed to the plot when the two occupied nearby cells in October 2011. The inmate, known as Bino, approached Dewani's lawyers with the confession when Dewani was fighting extradition to South Africa to face charges over his wife's death. Dewani denies recruiting taxi driver Tongo to organise the murder of his new Swedish wife shortly after they arrived in Cape Town for part of their honeymoon in November 2010. Tongo and two hitmen - Mziwamadoda Qwabe and Xolile Mngeni - claim the successful businessman masterminded the plot to kill the Swedish engineer and promised to pay them £850. Dewani's trial continues. Dewani (right) has denied knowing anything about a plot to kill his new bride and said they were hijacked as Zola Tongo (left) was driving them through Gugulethu township .

"A house painter denies ambushing a San Diego sports anchor who was riddled with bullets outside his home in Scripps Ranch last week. Mike Montana, 54, pleaded not guilty Tuesday to a charge of attempted murder on KFMB-TV's Kyle Kraska, whose home Montana had been hired to paint months earlier. Prosecutor Rebecca Zipp said that Montana 'ambushed' Kraska, hitting him six times as he shot up the sportscaster's silver Mercedes. Crime scene: Sports anchor Kyle Kraska was found shot six times outside his home . Montana also was charged with making a threat against another individual, but prosecutors did not go into details about that case. Police say Montana was in a dispute with Kraska over work done on the reporter's home. Montana surrendered to authorities the same day after a SWAT standoff at his home in El Cajon, a city east of San Diego. Zipp said the attack on Kraska was 'willful, deliberate and premeditated.' The judge set bail at $750,000. According to the CBS affiliate, Kraska is making good progress in his recovery at a local hospital. Todd Villalobos, a KFMB sports producer and friend of Kraska, told the station that the anchor hired Montana to paint the exterior of his house after seeing him work in the neighborhood. Villalobos said Kraska was dissatisfied with the painter's work. But Kraska he paid the painter, and the two agreed to part ways. Pleading not guilty: Mike Montana, 54, denies the charge he ambushed a local sports anchor found shot in his car . Months later, Montana began leaving notes on Kraska's door, Villalobos said, according to KFMB. Kraska is the sports director at KFMB, where he has worked since 1999. He has been  the station's evening sports anchor since 2003 and hosts the San Diego Chargers postgame show. The Boston native began his career as weekend sports anchor in Watertown, New York, during his senior year at Syracuse University before working at stations in California, Florida and Texas. In a January 2014 filing for personal bankruptcy protection, Montana identified himself as self-employed and the sole owner of Superior Painting Corp.","Kyle Kraska of KFMB-TV was shot while sitting in his car outside his home .

"A Detroit man walked up to a bus stop Saturday asking if people were Muslims and stabbed two that responded no, police say. Federal authorities are investigating possible hate crime charges after Terrence Lavaron Thomas, 39, knifed one 52-year-old victim five times and stabbed another, 51, in the hand. 'He was not happy that [the victims] indicated that they were not Muslims,' Southfield Police Chief Eric Hawkins told the Washington Post. Thomas, according to Hawkins, 'said that he was a Muslim.' Investigation: Federal authorities are investigating whether Terrence Lavaron Thomas, 39, committed hate crimes when he stabbed two at a bus stop who told him they were not Muslim . After he 'engaged in conversation' with several people at the bus stop by the Northland Mall, police said he 'asked some of the folks there if they were Muslims.' The victims 'responded that they were not, and then there was some back-and-forth between the victims and the suspect,' Hawkins said, according to the Detroit Free Press. Thomas then pulled out a three-inch folding knife 'without provocation' and attacked one of the men, stabbing him once in the face, once in the neck and three times in the back, police said. He then stabbed another victim in the hand after he attempted to intervene. Police caught up to Thomas only a few blocks away from the bus shelter shortly after the incident, finding two knives and some marijuana. 'We are getting indications through my officers that the suspect was somewhat incoherent afterward, and so there's a question about his stability,' Hawkins said. The two men were treated at Providence Hospital and released with non-life-threatening injuries. Southfield police contacted the FBI after the incident and said the agency is investigating possible hate crime charges, according to a press release from the department  Tuesday. Investigators will also be looking into possible state charges of ethnic intimidation. Under Michigan state law 'malicious' physical contact with the intent to 'intimidate or harass another person because of that person's race, color, religion, gender, or national origin' is considered ethnic intimidation. Thomas is currently charged with two counts of assault with intent to murder, one count of carrying a dangerous weapon with unlawful intent and one count of possession of marijuana. Magistrate Eman Jajonie-Daman set Thomas’s bond at $1 million and scheduled a preliminary examination for March 4.","Terrence Lavaron Thomas, 39, walked up to several people at a bus stop and engaged them in conversation .

"Nokia's last chance to get back into the smartphone game did not go to plan yesterday. First the Finnish firm suffered the indignity of watching their share price fall by per 10 per cent within an hour of unveiling the Windows Phone-powered Lumia 920. The company is battling a wave of in-difference against their hardware - and so put all their efforts into getting its 'PureView' camera noticed.

In the video, a man rides a bicycle, with another woman riding alongside. Comparison shots show the difference between stabilised footage and non-stabilised footage. Everything in the video implies the man on the bike is filming the footage. But a background check gives the game away...

"During a Thursday hearing, Sen. Barbara Boxer suggested that former EPA administrator Lisa Jackson was following precedent by setting up an email alias to conduct official government business. But the researcher who uncovered Jackson's 'Richard Windsor' alias account last year said Jackson's habit of hiding some of her official correspondence was both unprecedented and illegal. The EPA's inspector general is investigating whether Jackson was attempting to shield her activities from Congress and from citizen requests under the Freedom Of Information Act. The question was raised during a hearing on the confirmation of Gina McCarthy to serve as the agency's next administrator . Former EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson resigned in December, shortly before the agency started providing a Freedom Of Information Act requester with copies of emails linked to a phony 'Richard Windsor' account she used for some official business . According to a memo the EPA sent to the National Archivist in 2008, it was standard practice for top officials to have two email accounts, in part to help them distinguish between urgent communications and garden-variety emails that flooded their in-boxes every day. Clinton administration EPA administrator Carol Browner and her successors used secondary email addresses that were related to their official identities in the EPA's computer systems. But Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) senior fellow Chris Horner told MailOnline that Jackson, who resigned in December, broke with tradition and created an entirely new identity so that she could conduct some correspondence in secret. 'I found the memo and revealed it in my book,' Horner said, 'and then CEI sued the EPA for the ""Richard Windsor"" emails.' 'EPA's final document production deadline in that lawsuit is April 15th,' he explained, 'and then we'll be before a judge to argue about thousands of pages that EPA is withholding.' 'They owed us 12,000 emails, and they provided 2,000 per month when they were required to give us 3,000. We don't expect them to comply with the law any more than they have been already.' Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer suggested that Bush-era EPA leaders also used fake email accounts, including one with the alias 'Tofu.' Competitive Enterprise Institute senior fellow Chris Horner (R) uncovered EPA's history of providing its top officials with secondary email accounts. In a Senate hearing Wyoming Republican John Barrasso explained that Lisa Jackson took that practice into uncharted territory . In an attempt to diffuse what became a spirited debate with Wyoming Republican Sen. John Barrasso, Boxer provided examples of Bush administration EPA officials who had their own secondary email addresses. EPA chief Christine Todd Whitman,she said, used the alias 'ToWhit.' Administrator Stephen Johnson used 'ToCarter.' Marianne Horinko, an acting administrator in 2003, had an email alias called 'ToDuke.' And Bush-era acting administrator Marcus Peacock used 'Tofu.' 'All of them have used it,' Boxer said. 'I don't think it is anything nefarious.' Horner and Sen. Barrasso both called the argument nonsense. Gina McCarthy, an assistant administrator with the EPA, will take the agency's top job if the Senate confirms her . Vegetarian emails? Boxer revealed that Marcus Peacock (L) once an acting EPA administrator in the George W. Bush administration, used a secondary address with the alias 'Tofu' 'The claim that ""everybody does it"" is utterly unfounded,' Horner told MailOnline, 'and no one has provided any support for that claim.' 'Jackson created a second identity for the purpose of conducting some official communications, and that's both unprecedented and a violation of the Federal Records Act.' The EPA has said it followed a policy requiring the disclosure that 'Richard Windsor' was an alias for Lisa Jackson. Barrasso said in the hearing Thursday that he had obtained copies of emails between 'Windsor' and Gina McCarthy that provided no information about Windsor's true identity. 'The email alias ""Richard Windsor"" does not comply with the rules,' Barrasso said during Thursday's hearing. 'I wonder if anyone at the EPA objected,' he asked McCarthy, 'or if you personally objected to EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson using an alias that was absolutely against the policy of the EPA? And your emails back to her go back to 2009.' 'I think it’s important for all of us to know if the EPA and this administration is going to be transparent,' he continued, 'or is intentionally deciding to try to deceive the American people.' EPA Administrator Christine Todd Whitman (L) used the email alias was . 'ToWhit' and acting administrator Marianne Horinko (R) used 'ToDuke.' Their accounts, unlike recently-resigned administrator Lisa Jackson's, . were linked to their actual identities . Bush-era EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson (L) used 'ToCarter' as his secondary email name. Bob Perciasepe (R) was an assistant EPA administrator in the Clinton administration, and is now acting administrator under Obama. Sen. Boxer did not say what his alias was in the 1990s, or if he uses one now . Louisiana Republican Sen. David Vitter cracked a joke about 'Windsor,' calling it 'pretty monarchist.' 'Now, . a lot of folks would say that is appropriate for EPA, he quipped, 'but I . personally vote for tofu. I think that is more on the mark' for an . agency known for embracing liberal politics. 'I'm a meat-eater myself,' McCarthy replied, to chuckles from the gallery. Horner first exposed the practice of EPA leaders obscuring their official communication through fake email aliases, in his 2012 book The Liberal War On Transparency. To date, no evidence has emerged that other federal agencies have similar policies. The EPA wrote in its 2008 memo to the National Archivist that the secondary email accounts up to that time were all intact or suffered 'minimal' archiving losses. It's unclear how much of Lisa Jackson's 'Richard Windsor' account has been deleted, since the agency hasn't yet complied with Horner's FOIA request in full. EPA also wrote that Browner, the first administrator given the option of a secondary email account, 'reportedly' never made use of hers. Horner said he's skeptical of that, calling it in a 2012 op-ed 'simply an assertion, one EPA elected not to check.' A spokesperson for Sen. Boxer referred an email from MailOnline to Environment & Public Works committee staff, who declined to speak on the record for this story. In this 2008 letter to the National Archivist, the EPA acknowledged that it had been providing officials with extra email accounts, and that some of the emails in those accounts had been deleted .","California Democratic senator cited Bush-era EPA chiefs who had secondary email addresses .
Those bureaucrats followed an EPA policy that linked extra accounts to their official identities .

"LinkedIn, the job social networking site, has found itself at the center of a sexism storm after it pulled down ad posts of a woman they deemed too attractive to be a real-life web-engineer. The controversy began when developer networking platform Toptal posted a series of advertisements onto LinkedIn aimed at the web-engineering sector. However, LinkedIn quickly disabled the ads with no explanation and requested images 'related to the product', which caused a furious response from Toptal's CEO. Rejected: This picture of Argentinian web developer Florencia Antara (left and right) was removed from LinkedIn over the weekend and then allowed to be re-posted after accusations of sexism were leveled . Spam-Like: This is how the advertisement appeared on LinkedIn - leading some to compare it to a mass spam email using attractive women to get traffic . 'The fact of the matter is: members of the tech community (LinkedIn users) saw it as impossible that our female engineers could actually be engineers, and a leader of the tech community (LinkedIn) agreed with them,' wrote Toptal's CEO, Taso Du Val in a blog post according to The Daily Dot. 'Unfortunately we're banned from showing anything except 100 percent, all make software advertisements from now on and so, that's what you'll be getting.' At first, Toptal had simply sent the same advertisements back to LinkedIn, including that of Argentinian web developer Florencia Antara, but LinkedIn barred them until they had made the necessary changes. 'Today was a disappointing day at Toptal. We saw extreme sexism within the tech community, from an industry leader and advertising partner that we work with quite extensively: LinkedIn,' wrote Du Val in a post entitled 'In Defence of Female Engineers.' Outraged: Toptal CEO Taso Du Val made his displeasure at LinkedIn known through a blog post entitled 'In Defense of Female Engineers' In response, a spokesperson for LinkedIn, which bills itself as the 'World's Largest Professional Network', said the ads were rejected in a mistake caused by a review at their customer service team. ''While Customer Service was going through a standard process of reviewing LinkedIn Ads, TopTal's ads were rejected in error. We have taken the necessary measures to approve the previously rejected ads, and TopTal can now run them on our platform as intended.' However, the initial decision by LinkedIn provoked a furious response from readers of Du Val's blog. 'LinkedIn appears to be engaging in slut-shaming ,and nerd oppression because no female engineer could look good. Engineers must be slide rule nerds,' wrote one reader in support of Du Val. Toptal also used an image of actress Amanda Schull to represent their female engineers - which they later deleted . However, the issue became complicated when it was pointed out that Toptal did not use actual images of every engineer they were advertising. They used a mixture of stock photography and the real pictures of software engineers with portfolios on their website - including a picture of actress Amanda Schull, who appears in the USA Network television drama series 'Suits'. In the immediate aftermath of the sexism controversy, Toptal deleted this profile online and were unrepentant in their defense. 'And even if they were only stock photography, who cares?' wrote Du Val. 'The point is, they're perfectly fine and represent normal professional people.' Once the profile using Schull's image was removed, the only remaining example of a woman in Toptal's advertisements was Argentinian Antara. 'Florencia Antara is 100 percent authentic,' said Du Val, pointing out the picture used in her ad was from her own profile. Regardless, many commentators were sided with LinkedIn, despite criticizing the web giant for blocking the ads. Some said that the issue was more of false representation by Toptal and pointed out that the ads gave off a 'spam' vibe. LinkedIn describes itself as the 'World's Largest Professional Network' for those looking to make contacts within their respective industries . 'Imagine if someone saw this ad while looking over your shoulder, didn't look very closely, and all they saw was a pretty face and '$1800-2800/wk,' commented on blog posting. Indeed, some felt that the images were simply to overt, even if they were the true representative of Antara. 'What's with the bra strap showing? How does that help emphasize her abilities as a developer?' said Macman 851. 'Why is she staring at the camera as if she is about to make love to it? 'The images are a bit suggestive and I would like to kindly turn the tables and ask you why you felt you needed to portray these women in such a sexually suggestive light than a professional light.' Another wrote: 'I don't think it's the fact that the women are intrinsically attractive, but rather the fact that they're consciously choosing the pose/makeup/lighting in order the emulate the design language of the adultFriendFinder-style ads ... The fact that most of the copy could apply equally well to sex trafficking doesn't help much either.' Ultimately, even though Du Val was satisfied that the advertisements, bar Amandad Schull's picture profile were readmitted, he felt it did not explain the original decision by LinkedIn to remove the ads only with the women.",LinkedIn has denied the accusation and claims an ad served by Toptal was temporarily taken down in error .

"Superfit Robert McCloud is closing in on his black belt in martial arts - despite only having one leg. The 40-year-old amputee, who coined his nickname 'Stumpy' to put people at ease, lost his right leg in a motorbike accident when he was aged 21. But now he is thought to be the only person in the UK with such a disability to earn a red stripe in mixed martial arts.

Mr McCloud, of Swindon, says it was sport and his daughter Jade - also a talented martial artist - which helped him put the horrifying accident, which he openly admits was his fauly, behind him. He told Martial Arts Illustrated: 'Doctors worked in relays through the night to save my life and said my fitness saved me. 'It was the main reason I survived the accident because martial arts discipline makes you physically and mentally stronger.'

"President Barack Obama pledged in the spring of 2013 to give back 5 per cent of his $400,000 salary in solidarity with federal government workers who were expected to lose an average of two weeks' pay because of automatic budget cuts – known in Washington parlance as a 'sequester.' A year later, however, it's not clear that he made good on his $20,000 promise. Mr. and Mrs. Obama's 2013 tax return, which the White House published last month, shows an adjusted gross income of $481,098. The couple claimed $147,769 in itemized deductions, but no line-item for a $20,000 give-back to the United States Treasury is anywhere to be found. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney reported on April 11 that the first family made $59,251 in deductible donations, and said that the largest such gift was $8,751 to the Fisher House Foundation, a network of 'comfort homes' where family members of wounded warriors can stay while their loved ones are receiving medical treatment. They also deducted $42,383 in interest on their Illinois home mortgage and another $29,176 in personal property taxes. But the Obamas' Schedule A, where they would likely deduct a salary rebate from their income for tax purposes, is silent on the matter. Scroll down for video . Man of the people: President Obama lunched with workers at a Washington, D.C. Shake Shack last week, but one of his 2013 efforts at linking arms with the common man may have been an illusion . The New York Times reported on April 3, 2013 that Obama made his intentions known at the height of the national debate over the budget sequester. 'The president has decided that to share in the sacrifice being made by public servants across the federal government that are affected by the sequester, he will contribute a portion of his salary back to the Treasury,' the Times quoted an Obama administration official saying. Since the salary of a U.S. president is set by law and can't be altered, the official said, Obama planned to pay $20,000 to the Treasury in equal installments beginning retroactively in March, and ending at the close of the fiscal year in September. Those seven checks, then, would have been for $2,857.14 each. But there's no evidence ink ever hit paper. The Washington Free Beacon first reported on the apparent conflict between what Obama said in 2013 and what he may have failed to do. Neither that outlet nor MailOnline has been able to get the White House to comment: Emails from MailOnline were not returned, and a phone message went unanswered. It's possible that Obama ultimately decided to wait until the furloughs actually materialized before putting his money where his surrogate's mouth was. Ultimately, the fears of career disruptions because of temporary layoffs were overblown. The online magazine Government Executive reported in August that nearly every major federal agency reduced or eliminated its furlough plans, choosing to cut elsewhere in order to save those jobs. GoxExec noted that many cabinet-level departments 'told Congress they would have to furlough employees, but ended up backtracking.' Solidarity: As Obama was pledging to give up part of his salary in common cause with ordinary federal workers, the National Treasury Employees Union was protesting threatened furloughs that never came . 'The Education and Justice departments fall into this category,' according to that report. 'The Agriculture, Transportation and Homeland Security departments all received authority to transfer funds between agency accounts, and were therefore able to cancel planned furloughs. The Commerce Department projected furloughs at its National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, only to cancel them in May.' The Treasury, Housing and Urban Development Department, Interior and Labor Departments all reported drastically cutting the number of furlough days as well. The net impact of furloughs on typical government employees, then, was far less than what was predicted when the president made his promise. It appears that so, too, was his symbolic financial contribution.","The president pledged a year ago to send $20,000 of his 2013 salary back to the treasury as a symbolic gesture to furloughed employees .
Most of the furloughs never materialized, and Obama's promised salary give-back may also have dissolved with the passage of time .
The joint tax return he filed with the first lady shows no indication of a rebate to the Treasury – something he would logically have deducted from his taxable income .
Federal law sets the president's salary at $400,000, making it impossible for the president to reduce his pay without writing a check for the balance ."
"The towering symbol that honors the nation's first president reopened to the public on Monday, nearly three years after an earthquake cracked and chipped the 130-year-old stone obelisk. After fences were dismantled and construction equipment removed, the Washington Monument drew a cross-section of Americans who wanted to be among to first visit the newly reopened historic site. For many of them, it was their first chance to see the 555-foot-tall monument's interior and the nation's capital from its highest point. Scroll down for video .

The Washington Monument has finally reopened after it was closed nearly three years after a 5.8-magnitude earthquake . After an official ceremony with Al Roker as master of ceremonies and attended by guests such as Sally Jewell and Bob Vogel, tourists were able to ascend the monument. 'I've seen pictures of it, but I've never been here to see it,' said Brandon Hillock, 22, from near Salt Lake City, visiting after a two-year Mormon mission in Virginia. 'It's really cool to come here and experience what this is all about and the history behind it.' Engineers have spent nearly 1,000 days on an extensive analysis and restoration of what was once the tallest structure in the world. A 5.8-magnitude quake in August 2011 caused widespread damage. It shook some stones loose and caused more than 150 cracks. From massive scaffolding built around the monument after the quake, engineers and stone masons made repairs stone by stone. Now, new exhibits have been installed at the top, and visitors can once again ride an elevator to look out over the National Mall. The National Park Service is offering extended hours through the summer for daytime and evening visits. Tickets can be reserved online, but they're already booked into June. Kourtney Butler of Miami just graduated from Howard University, but the monument has been closed and under construction for most of her four years living in Washington.

Kristopher Lewis of Augusta, Georgia, and his wife, Mary Lewis, were visiting Washington for a conference. 'I played in front of the monument when I was in the eighth-grade band, so I wanted to come back and see it,' Mrs Lewis said. For Kristopher Lewis, it was his first visit. Looking up, he said he felt patriotic. 'There's so many amazing historical sites in Washington, D.C., and just to be able to go up to the top of the monument and to look around and see all the city from that vantage point, not to mention the history of the monument itself, I think will be wonderful,' he said.

TV weatherman Al Roker acted as the master-of-ceremonies today (right) American Idol Season 12 winner Candice Glover singing at the official reopening ceremony after repairs from earthquake damage closed it to the public over two and half years ago . The obelisk stands almost at the heart of Washington DC. Built between 1848 and 1884 in tribute to George Washington, the first U.S. president, it has been shut to visitors for the last 32 months – thanks to the cracks that emerged in its stonework as a result of the earthquake that struck the city on August 23, 2011. The 5.8-magnitude quake was followed by a series of tremors that were as strong as 4.5 on the Richter scale. These problems were compounded by Hurricane Irene, which swept into Washington D.C. four days later – adding to the architectural stress on the near two-century-old edifice. Visitor access to the observation deck – which sits at 500ft and offers widescreen views of America’s bureaucratic hub – was closed off immediately after the earthquake. Public tours began today at 1pm local time – after a short ceremony to mark the Monument’s return. Some 150 cracks appeared in its masonry, mainly as a result of the initial earthquake. The necessary repairs have cost $15million. Half of this sum has come from public funding, with another $7.5million provided by US billionaire philanthropist David Rubenstein. Rubenstein says that he offered the donation after realising how much the Washington Monument means to a lot of Americans. ‘It became clear to me that the Washington Monument symbolises many things for our country – the freedoms, patriotism, George Washington, leadership,’ he said. ‘It has been moving to see how many people are affected by it.’ Although it is now an unmistakeable part of the Washington DC landscape, the Monument’s construction was not without its issues. Honor guards walk in front of the historic monument during a reopening ceremony on May 12, 2014 in Washington D.C. Its 36-year gestation was a drawn-out affair, with delays – caused by a lack of funding, as well as the interruption of the American Civil War – leaving it, at one point, half finished. This start-stop process is visible in the two shades of stone that make up the obelisk. Builders returning to the project in 1879 were unable to source granite of the exact same hue as the blocks which make up the Monument’s lower third – and were forced to continue construction with material of a slightly darker colour. Despite its woes over the last three years, the future of the Monument was never in doubt. ‘It's structurally sound and not going anywhere,’ Bob Vogel, Superintendent of the National Mall and Memorial Parks emphasised in September 2011. By the time it was completed, the Washington Monument was the tallest structure on the planet – although it would lose that title to the Eiffel Tower within four years. It is still the world’s tallest stone structure. Preparing to meet its public: The Washington Monument reopened to visitors around 1pm local time on Monday .

"The British banker accused of brutally murdering two women in his luxury Hong Kong apartment allegedly invited another woman back to his flat prior to the killings but was turned down by her because she thought he was 'acting strangely'. Rurik Jutting, 29, invited the Indonesian nanny, who wishes to remain anonymous, back to his flat in the early hours of last Saturday – just two hours before police arrived at his home and found the decomposing body of one woman and another with stab wounds to her throat and buttock. The Cambridge graduate, who worked for Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML), has since been charged with the murders of the two women – revealed to be 29-year-old Seneng Mujiasih, who also goes by the name Jesse Lorena Ruri, and 25-year-old Sumarti Ningsih. Scroll down for video . Rurik Jutting, who moved to Hong Kong from London  last year, was charged with two counts of murder after the bodies of two women were found in his  flat. Pictured: Jutting  partying with young women prior to his arrest . Jutting (pictured  being taken to a Hong Kong court by police) allegedly chatted up an Indonesian nanny just hours prior to his arrest for the murder of two women after whose bodies were found in his luxury apartment . The former public schoolboy, who did not enter a plea when he was charged on Monday, was arrested after calling police to his £2,000-a-month high-rise flat following a night out at the  Makati Pub & Disco. It was at the nightclub prior to his arrest that he allegedly began chatting to the mother of three, who has lived in the former British colony for four years and works as a nanny for a Hong Kong Chinese family. She claimed he approached her and a friend at the bar and said 'Hi, girls. Where are you from? How old are you?', before buying a round of drinks for them. After just minutes of chatting, he allegedly asked the nanny to return to his apartment with him but she said she denied his request because of his 'strange' behaviour. She told The Telegraph: 'I said, ""No, I'm with my friends. I'm just here to party with my friends."" 'He was just walking around and around and around. 'It was strange. I didn't understand why. He looked happy but I didn't understand why he was moving around all the time.' The woman, who is believed to be in her thirties, said she had witnessed Jutting pacing the club, occasionally grabbing women, before he approached her. Jutting allegedly invited the nanny back to his apartment after buying her a round of drinks at Makati nightclub . Sex workers named locally as Sumarti Ningsih (left) and Seneng Mujiasih, also known as Jesse Lorena Ruri (right), were found dead at Jutting's blood-spattered 31st-floor apartment in Hong Kong after he called police . Her comments come after it was revealed Jutting contacted his ex-girlfriend Ariane Guarin last month asking if she would fly out to visit him in Hong Kong. The message sent to the 22-year-old nightclub hostess from the Philippines was abrupt and to the point. It simply said: ‘Did you get your passport? If so, do you want to come to Hong Kong this weekend? And stay the week?.' Miss Guarin, who had a six-month relationship with Jutting, said she felt 'lucky' not to have flown out to stay with him. She said: ‘I had a problem applying for my passport because I don’t have a valid identity card. 'He wanted me to stay for a week with him but I couldn’t go without a passport. 'I feel lucky. I am really thankful that it wasn’t me.’ Earlier today, more than 100 people attended a vigil for the two victims, who were both sex workers in Hong Kong's red light district. Ms Ningsih's cousin, Jumiati, said at the vigil that she had last seen her relative in August in their home village in Indonesia. Prior to his arrest, Jutting, who studied at Cambridge University, sent a message to his former girlfriend of six months, Ariane Guarin (pictured together above), asking her to fly over to Hong Kong to visit him for a week .

More than 100 people attended a vigil for the two victims today, where many called for 'justice' for the women . Jumiati, who goes by only one name, said she called police about a week ago to report that her cousin was missing and was later asked to identify her body. 'I hope the killer will be punished and will feel the same as what has been done to my cousin,' she said at the vigil. Susiati, a friend of the victim, broke down in tears as she remembered Ms Ningsih, who had a five-year-old son back home. 'I have lost my best friend, and I am devastated,' she said. Several in the crowd held signs demanding reforms to Hong Kong and Indonesian laws governing how domestic workers can find work and how long they can stay in the city.

"A man murdered his girlfriend following a massive fight, posted grisly photos of her naked body online and scrawled 'she killed me first' over a picture in her room before fleeing, police have said. David Kalac, 33, surrendered to cops in Wilsonville, Oregon late on Wednesday night after a lengthy manhunt, during which he managed to elude authorities in a high-speed chase. His arrest came hours after the body of his girlfriend, 30-year-old Amber Lynn Coplin, was found inside her Port Orchard, Washington home by her 13-year-old son and estranged husband. The boy told detective that he had heard Kalac and Coplin arguing loudly on Monday night, and witnesses said they heard what sounded like a violent argument and loud thumping inside the home. Arrest: David Kalac, 33, left in his booking photo and right after he was arrested, surrendered to police in Oregon on Wednesday after cops had a warrant out for his arrest for killing a woman in Washington . The next morning, the teenager awoke to find Kalac gone and thought his mother was still sleeping as he headed to school, court documents show. He returned home from school on Tuesday morning and took a nap, but when he awoke later that afternoon, his mother's gold 2001 Ford Focus was gone. The youngster went to check on his mother and 'found her unresponsive' so he called his father - Coplin's estranged husband - who came over and found the body just before 3.30pm on Tuesday. He called 911 and reported that Coplin's face was 'bashed in', that her car was missing and that she was bloody and bruised, according to court documents. Police arrived on the scene within minutes and found Amber Lynn murdered among horrifying messages scrawled throughout the room. By her head, they found her driver's license with the word 'dead' written across it. The words 'bad news' were written on blinds, while 'she killed me first' was written on a picture on the wall. Tragedy: Amber Lynn Coplin's body was found by her 13-year-old son, right, in her bedroom on Tuesday . Just half an hour before her estranged husband called police, mysterious messages appeared on the photo sharing website 4chan apparently showing her murdered naked body. 'Check the news for Port Orchard Washington in a few hours,' said the message, viewed by MailOnline. 'Her son will be home from school soon. He'll find her, then call the cops. 'I just wanted to share the pics before they find me. I bought a BB gun that looks realistic enough. When they come, I'll pull it and it will be suicide by cop. 'I understand the doubts. Just check the f***ing news. I have to lose my phone now.' In another graphic message, the poster added that 'it's way harder to strangle someone than it looks in the movies' and described how she had fought hard for her life. Police said that Kalac also texted a friend from his cellphone on Tuesday morning telling the friend that he would read about him in the news. Heartbreaking: Coplin's teenage son called his dad (right) - Coplin's estranged husband - after he found his mother's unresponsive body on Tuesday afternoon. Paul Coplin then called authorities . Deputies have confirmed that the gruesome photos are of the victim and the crime scene. 'He's our primary suspect,' sheriff's Deputy Scott Wilson said on Wednesday. 'It stands to reason that in all likelihood he is the person who posted those photographs.' On Wednesday, police put out a warrant for Kalac's arrest and urged the public to contact them if they saw Coplin's missing car. Kalac drove three hours to Portland, where a police officer spotted the vehicle about 1.15am on Wednesday. After a high-speed chase, Kalac swerved into on-coming traffic, forcing police to call off their pursuit. But on Wednesday night, Kalac was arrested at a transit center in Wilsonville, about 20 miles south of Portland. An officer was patrolling the area when the man came out of a wooded area near a parking lot, Clackamas County sheriff's Sergeant Nate Thompson said. Scene: She was found murdered inside her Port Orchard, Washington home, pictured, on Tuesday afternoon - just half an hour after the killer apparently posted grisly images of her naked body online . Sick: Kalac, her boyfriend, also allegedly left messages scrawled inside her bedroom, including 'she killed me first' on a picture and 'dead' across the driving license, which was found near her head . 'He basically said, ""I have a warrant for my arrest"",' Thompson said. Kalac was cooperative but provided no details about how he got to Wilsonville, the spokesman said. Washington state detectives have arrived in Portland and hoped to interview him, as well as take possession of the dead woman's car, which was found in Portland. Kalac has been charged with second-degree murder in the slaying. He was transported to Portland, where he was being held on $2 million bail. Kalac also has a criminal history in Washington state and Virginia that includes convictions for assault, burglary and DUI, Kitsap County, Washington, records have revealed. Before David Kalac was arrested, he allegedly posted photographs of Amber Lynn Coplin's dead body on 4chan. Created in 2003 by a 15-year-old high school student from New York City, Christopher Poole, 4chan was originally meant to be a forum to discuss Japanese anime and post photos. The image board site soon grew to by much more, and quickly became one of the biggest websites in the world. The biggest difference between 4chan and other websites however is that it allows commenters and contributors to post anonymously, giving many free reign to do things they would not do otherwise. While this has led to the site producing some amusing and funny pranks, many are horrific and have led to the arrest of the person or persons who created them. LOLCats – The Internet obsession with cats actually began back in 2005 when one 4Chan commenter decided to post as a photo of a cat waiting for Caturday. It all took off from there. Rickroll – In 2007, a fake link to the trailer for the video game Grand Theft Auto IV was posted to the site after the website of the game’s publisher, Rockstar Games, crashed. Instead of seeing a look at the highly anticipated new game, eager fans were instead taken to the YouTube page for the Rick Astley music video 'Never Gonna Give You Up'. Steve Jobs Death – In 2008 members on the site spread a false rumor that Steve Jobs was dead, causing Apple stock prices to plummet a whopping 10% in one day. Send Justin Bieber To North Korea – Justin Bieber has long been a target for the site, and in 2010 he wanted fans to tell him where they wanted him to go on his My World Tour. 4Chan users hacked his site, and the overwhelming winner was North Korea. The Canadian did not ultimately make the trip. Jessi Slaughter – In what may have been their most vicious attack to date, members of 4Chan began to cyberbully an 11-year-old girl after claiming she was having a relationship with an older man. They posted her address, called her house, and spread false rumors and reports about her and her family. The threats got so bad that the young girl was put in police protection at one point. Trayvon Martin – In 2012 a 4Chan hacker and white supremacist falsely claimed they had hacked into Trayvon Martin’s email and Facebook accounts after his murder, posting emails and photos that were supposed to back up the false claim that Martin was a drug addict and dealer. Cutting For Bieber – In early 2013, a member of 4Chan created an elaborate Twitter hoax in which they urged fans of Justin Bieber to cut themselves so the pop star would stop smoking weed. Soon, the hashtags #cutforbieber and #cuttingforbieber amassed numerous photos of fans who claimed to have slashed their wrists and forearms over Bieber's drug use. Taylor Swift's Biggest Fan – In 2013 Taylor Swift, like Bieber, wanted fans to help her out with her next contest. She was looking for her biggest fan, and 4Chan made sure the winner was a 39-year-old man named Charles who wanted to ‘sniff Taylor’s hair.’ The contest was ultimately cancelled. Celebrity Nude Leaks – Nothing 4Chan has done has had a bigger impact however than the leaking of hundreds of nude photos of celebrities in 2014, something that eventually led to the FBI getting involved. Victims included A-list stars like Jennifer Lawrence, Gabrielle Union, Kim Kardashian and Rihanna.","David Kalac and his girlfriend Amber Lynn Coplin 'were heard arguing on Monday night and on Tuesday, her son assumed she was sleeping in'

"For decades, car makers have been searching for the perfect environmentally friendly fuel. Now, one firm seems to have found the answer – a car that can run on nothing more than air. The Peugeot 2008 Hybrid Air promises to be more ecologically sound than the current breed of ‘green’ vehicles that combine electric engines with traditional ones. Scroll down for video . Under the bonnet: This diagram shows how the new hybrid car works. While the it is moving, air is pumped into a cylinder using surplus energy from the petrol engine, plus energy from the wheels and heat from the brakes . Clean driving: The Peugeot 2008 Hybrid Air has a conventional petrol engine linked to a hydraulic air motor and pump, allowing it to run on air, petrol, or a combination of the two - depending on driving conditions . Behind the wheel: A stripped-back look at the new hybrid. Motorists will be able to use zero-emissions air power for lower-speed driving. The feature is activated automatically when the car is doing under 43mph . It has a conventional petrol engine linked to a hydraulic air motor and pump. While the car is moving, air is pumped into a cylinder – just like a balloon being inflated – using surplus energy from the petrol engine, plus energy from the wheels and heat from the brakes. The air is then released to drive the hydraulic motor – allowing the car to run on air, petrol, or a combination of the two. Motorists will be able to use zero-emissions air power for lower-speed driving in cities. The feature is  activated automatically when the car is doing under 43mph. When accelerating or climbing hills, combined or ‘hybrid’ mode is preferable as the vehicle receives power from both engines. And for long-distance cruising, traditional petrol power is best. Current hybrids – such as the popular Toyota Prius – rely on heavy and expensive batteries that are difficult to dispose of, causing their own environmental problems. On pure electric cars, the batteries can also go flat and leave the driver stranded. In contrast, the new Peugeot will need no batteries. Instead, it will replenish itself  automatically by re-using energy that is ‘lost’ when slowing down  and braking. No battery required: This prototype shows motorists makes up the environmentally friendly car. Current hybrids rely on heavy and expensive batteries that are difficult to dispose of - but the Peugeot doesn't need one . A look inside: Ray Massey takes a spin in the new hybrid, revealing what the car's interior currently looks like. The sports utility vehicle will be available from 2016 for around £16,000 . The sports utility vehicle, available from 2016 for around £16,000, will be the first of a new generation of Peugeots and Citroens running – in part at least – on air. It currently manages around 94miles per gallon but engineers say that by 2020, future Peugeots and Citroens could average 117mpg. Around 100 elite scientists have spent the past three years working on the air-powered car in top-secret conditions at Peugeot’s research and development centre at Velizy, just south of Paris. A spokesman for manufacturer PSA Peugeot-Citroen said: ‘We are not talking about weird and wacky machines. These are going to be in everyday cars.’","The Peugeot 2008 Hybrid Air runs on nothing more than air .

"A Texas man was sentenced to 45 years Monday for strangling his wife while they argued over indecency charges for sexual contact with a child. Epifanio Guzman, 43, told jurors that he only realized he'd killed her after waking up the next morning beside her corpse, blood pooling in her mouth, the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal reports. Guzman and his wife Rachel Rodriguez, 41, were arguing after a party over an indecency charge that Guzman was facing for allegedly touching a 7-year-old relative's genitals over her clothing. Strangling: Epifanio Guzman, 43, was sentenced to 45 years with the possibility of parole Monday for strangling his wife while they argued over an indecency charge for sexual contact with a child . He said he began choking her from behind, only loosening his grasp when his wife's body went limp, before laying her into bed and falling asleep next to her. After discovering her dead in the morning, Guzman wrapped the body in a red sleeping bag and drove from their home in Lubbock, dumping her body in a secluded area along the way. His destination was Big Spring, where his mother lived with her husband, Alvino Gutierrez, whom Guzman says he wanted to kill but couldn't find the opportunity. Family members said that the couple knew each other from childhood, but when her mother married an uncle of Guzman's, she put a stop to a burgeoning romance. After being apart for 27 years, they reconnected at a family reunion and later married. Rodriguez stayed by Guzman's side through tough times, and had even posted bail after he was picked up on theft charges three days before he killed her. After dumping the body, Guzman stayed in Big Spring, visiting his niece, Juanita Rodriguez, at work, who asked him about scratches on his face and body. Video from KJTV . Deceased: Family members of Rachel Rodriguez, 41, were enraged that the dumping of her body had led to it decomposing, which meant they had to have a closed-casket burial . She said he told her he had left his wife because she repeatedly attacked him, and that he believed she had been unfaithful. The Tuesday after the killing, Rodriguez's brother, Daniel Arispe, who had been living with the couple, phoned a cousin who said Guzman had turned up at her apartment with a cut over his eye. At that time, Rodriguez's employer, Covenant Medical Center Advising, had become concerned after she had failed to show up for work, and the family called police. Police found the body Wednesday in the remote area where it had been dumped, arresting Guzman in Big Spring later that day on a warrant for indecency with a child. Guzman pleaded guilty on Monday to the charge of murder on Monday as part of an arrangement that saw the indecency charge dropped. In court, one of Rodriguez's sons, Israel Ledesma faced Guzman and told him that his marriage to his mother had been nothing but a lie. 'I hope you do' find peace, Ledesma said. 'I hope it’s slow.'","Epifanio Guzman of Lubbock choked his wife, Rachel Rodriguez, 41, and then laid her limp body in the bed .

"A woman whose painful bunion kept her from wearing high heels has spent thousands of dollars on a corrective procedure known as 'Cinderella surgery', just so she can fit her feet into the killer styles once again. Prior to the surgery, New York City resident Denise Maione-Schwind, a 35-year-old flight attendant, would often spend her evenings alone at home, unable to withstand the agony caused by heels, but determined not to wear flats on a night out. The Bunionplasty, a cosmetic procedure which Dr Neal Blitz has trademarked, corrected the bony bump on the side of her left foot, allowing her to get back into her beloved shoe collection. Shoe lover: Denise Maione-Schwind, a 35-year-old flight attendant, has resorted to having 'Cinderella surgery' on her foot to remove a painful bunion that kept her from wearing high heels . Ms Maione-Schwind was even able to walk within a week, despite the severity of the procedure, which costs thousands of dollars and has seen some women have their toes shortened or their feet completely reshaped. 'I realized I was no longer able to walk or dance around in heels because of my bunion and like many other women I have invested quite a lot in designer heels,' she explained. She added: 'The thought of not being able to wear heels again was daunting - as someone who loves to dance and enjoy life, flats were not an option - I was determined to dance in heels again.' Before and after: The surgery realigned the bone on Ms Maione-Schwind's foot, correcting a painful bump on its right side (left) The shoe lover admitted that she was scared on the day of the Bunionplasty, which was her first ever surgical procedure, but revealed that she never doubted her decision to undergo the procedure. During the healing process, the protective shoe she was required to wear was a conversation starter - in fact she learned that she wasn't alone in her suffering. 'I never knew how many people have bunions - some bigger and more agonizing than others,' she said. Social setback: The New York resident, pictured before the surgery, would often spend evenings at home, unable to withstand the agony caused by heels and determined not to wear flats on a night out . Reunited with her favorite footwear: Ms Maione-Schwind is seen wearing heels for the first time after her surgery . But now, the bony bump that once ruled her social life is nothing more than a secret scar. 'Unless I tell them, no-one can tell I had the surgery,' she said. Ms Maione-Schwind can now happily sport any shoe she wishes, pain free, and even hopes to run the New York Marathon, which would have caused her severe discomfort in the past. Shop talk: Ms Maione-Schwind picks up some new additions to her closet after recovering from her surgery . Dr Blitz, a Manhattan-based reconstructive foot surgeon who created the Bunionplasty, said that Ms Maione-Schwind had put off the surgery for years because of her demanding job, but once she found the time enjoyed a speedy recovery. He added: 'It allowed her to immediately walk on the foot without the need for a cast and crutches.'","Denise Maione-Schwind was unable to wear high heels due to pain caused by a bony bump on the side of her foot .

"'Let's do this': Aimee Copeland did not cry when her father told her she would have to have her remaining foot and fingers amputated . A young U.S. woman fighting a rare flesh-eating infection has been bravely looking at her ravaged hands without shedding any tears, her father said. Georgia graduate Aimee Copeland still doesn't know that doctors plan to amputate all her fingers, just as they had to remove most of her left leg, in order to save her life. 'Her fingers are basically mummified. The flesh is dead,' her father, Andy Copeland, said in a phone interview from Doctors Hospital in Augusta. He said she held one of her hands close to her face yesterday and asked family members about their condition. Mr Copeland told her: 'Your hands have been damaged... and we're trying to bring back as much of the life into the hands as possible.' He said she was 'well accepting' and that she responded with 'no tears or anything.' The 24-year-old student from an Atlanta suburb remains in a critical condition as she battles an infection called necrotizing fasciitis. Doctors initially feared they might have to remove her remaining foot and both hands. But her father said she now faces losing only her fingers after two days of treatment using a hyperbaric chamber, in which patients breathe pure oxygen to boost white blood cells and accelerate healing. Flesh on her palms that had been purple was turning pink again, he said. Copeland's father said she was still unaware of plans to amputate her fingers, an emotional disclosure that will likely require a counselor's help. Traumatic: The 24-year-old student from an Atlanta suburb remains in a critical condition as she battles an infection called necrotizing fasciitis . 'We don't know if she's aware of her (amputated) leg yet,' he said. 'We're in a don't ask, don't tell policy.' Copeland contracted the infection days after she suffered a deep cut on May 1 in a fall when a zip line snapped over rocks in the Little Tallapoosa River near the University of West Georgia, where she studies psychology. The flesh-eating bacteria, Aeromonas hydrophila, emit toxins that cut off blood flow to parts of the body. The affliction can destroy muscle, fat and skin tissue. Only a week ago, doctors gave her little chance of survival. But in recent days she has been alert and bored enough to have asked for a book to read. Distraught: Paige Copeland, center, cries as her parents Donna and Andy Copeland speak about their daughter Aimee after she had her leg amputated . Doctors had to amputate most of Miss Copeland's left leg to save her life, and her father has said she'll likely lose her fingers too. She has been unable to speak because of her breathing tube in he throat, but her parents said they've learned to read lips and are now able to communicate with their daughter, who was also asking for ice-cream. 'This doctor can't fathom a reason for why she's improved the way she has,' Mr Copeland said earlier this week. 'Her spirits are extraordinarily high. I am absolutely amazed.' Cherished: Miss Copeland, a 24-year-old graduate from Georgia, has fun with friends . He said his daughter seems aware that she's in the hospital after an accident. But for now, they're sparing her the details of her condition until after she has been removed from a respirator and is breathing on her own. He said the family also wanted to make sure a hospital counselor was available to help Copeland once she is informed of her condition. Losing a limb is extremely difficult emotionally, and can be particularly difficult for young people, said Dr. Nadine Kaslow, chief psychologist at Grady Hospital in Atlanta. 'There is a process that they go through, a grief process,' said Kaslow, who is not involved in Miss Copeland's care. 'There is shock, disbelief, anger, sadness and then a period of reconciling one to the situation and healing and figuring out how they are going to move forward in their life.' Prayers: Aimee Copeland's father says he is amazed by his daughter's attitude as she progresses . Doctors at the local emergency room in Carrollton closed the wound she suffered in the zip line accident with nearly two dozen staples, but it became infected within days. On May 4, she was diagnosed with the rare infection and flown 200 miles to Augusta for treatment by specialists at Doctors Hospital. Copeland's father said she faces a long recovery not just from her amputation but also from kidney failure and other organ damage caused by the infection. 'She's going to be here for months,' he said. 'She's going to need to regrow skin that was removed. She's going to need to learn to use prosthetics. She's going to still be on dialysis for a while.' Much-loved: Aimee's friends and family are praying for her survival and eventual recovery (from left - Aimee, mother Donna, father Andy and sister Paige) Some news reports have said Miss Copeland was recently diagnosed with lupus, a chronic disease that compromises the immune system, but her father said that was not true. Andy Copeland said his daughter had sought treatment for a skin rash. Doctors initially feared it might be a symptom of lupus, but tests revealed Copeland had a food allergy. 'She was a vegetarian and she had a soy-based diet,' Copeland's father said. 'And it turned out she was allergic to soy.' More than 50 people lined up in the first hour for a blood drive earlier this week at the gymnasium at the University of West Georgia, where Copeland attends school 200 miles from the Augusta hospital. Some students walked to the blood drive, while others drove from other parts of the state. Kara Dermo, a chemistry student who worked with Copeland at the Sunnyside Cafe, was one of the first in line. She was among the friends invited to try the zip line that sent Copeland plunging to the rocky river, but declined. Dermo said Copeland's illness has been weighing on the minds of people on campus. Even the slightest amount of good news has been enough to raise the hopes of fellow students. 'It's very close to home. It makes you realize anything could happen at any time,' Miss Dermo said.

Chavene King, a Johnson family . attorney, told MailOnline today that an expert took a close look at the . video footage captured by motion-activated cameras and discovered ‘a . very suspicious image’. ‘That evening there is a blurry . figure after the hour that the school had closed and you see what is a . silhouette of somebody walking in the area of the mat.’ King pointed to footage captured from camera ‘G-5’ in the gym aimed at the wrestling mats was what drew his concern. ‘The level of clarity of that image is far, far more pixelated than the same image at approximately 9am on that morning.’ While King stresses his impression of . the footage is ‘preliminary’, he believes the varying quality of the . image coupled with frequent absent time codes raises more suspicions. ‘I don’t know if it is the result of . somebody photoshopping this piece but it lacks time code data,’ he said. ‘In the morning image you have time codes but in the evening images you . don’t.’ Questions: His family's attorneys, Chevene King (left) and Benjamin Crump (right), pictured on CNN said that the footage has been doctored and that key parts are blurry and dark . Distraught: Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson have been calling for justice since their son died in January . Lt. Stryde Jones, of the Lowndes County Sherriff’s Office, maintains the video was not doctored. ‘We have never edited that video. We don’t even have the capabilities to edit the video.’ He said the CCTV footage that was ultimately turned over was stored in a chip. ‘The video chip we had was not the total video-it was a chip.’ Earlier this year they demanded . Kendrick’s body was exhumed. A private autopsy was then carried out and . found that the Kendrick Johnson, who went by the congenial moniker . ‘K.J.’, died by a blow to the neck and also revealed that the boy’s . organs were replaced with newspaper.

"Police are set to investigate a video which showed a teenage wakeboarding champion being dragged along a waterway by a £1million Ferrari at 'more than 80mph'. Daredevil  Jorge Gill, 19, got onto a wakeboard on the Maud Foster Drain north of Boston, Lincolnshire and was dragged along by a bright yellow Ferrari F50. But the reported speed of the car could prompt a police investigation into the stunt - which took place on a country lane which has a speed limit of 60mph. Scroll down for video . A video has emerged of Jorge Gill wakeboarding at reported speeds of up to 80mph behind a yellow Ferrari in a flooded ditch north of Boston, Lincolnshire . Photos taken at the scene show the wakeboarding champion clinging onto the line attached to the Ferrari as it flies along the road . The video shows Mr Gill jumping into the ditch after fixing his feet to the board. The driver of the Ferrari - a mid-90s sports car with a top speed of 200mph which is regarded as 'a road-legal racing car' - then accelerates down the country lane next to the ditch as Mr Gill holds on. Mr Gill, a two-time European wakeboarding champion, hurtled along the river as the Ferrari hit what was claimed to be speeds of 84mph. The film was shot by TaxTheRich, a  group of fast car enthusiasts known for making shocking videos. In the past they have thrashed a Rolls-Royce around a country estate and took a Ferrari Enzo rallying. Mr Gill, from North London, became an internet sensation earlier this year when he wakeboarded through a flooded car park in Guildford. The video posted on YouTube shows Mr Gill tie a cord to the spoiler of the Ferrari before jumping into the flooded ditch . He then holds on as the sports car drives along the neighbouring road, pulling him along at high speeds . The video shows him holding on for a distance of around 100metres as the car drives along the country road before he collapses into the river . The adrenaline junkie, who is also a five-time national champion, said he had the idea for the stunt while travelling. Boasting about the video, he said: 'I was on a mini-bus in Portugal when the idea came to me as a supercar flew past the bus and next to it was a river. 'The idea clicked, combining a supercar with wakeboarding seemed very unique to me. 'I was a little nervous beforehand. Normally I do around 20mph but for this I was going a lot faster. We had a few warm ups at lower speed and it was a bit scary when you hear the Ferrari's engine. 'It is dangerous, but you have to forget about the dangerous side until afterwards.' A spokesman for Lincolnshire Police said: 'The footage showing the wakeboarder and the Ferrari has been brought to the attention of Lincolnshire Police. 'We will examine it to establish if any offences have been committed. It appears that there may be issues concerning excessive speed and the manner in which the car was driven.' It is said the car reached speeds of more than 80mph on the 60mph-limit stretch of road, prompting a possible police investigation .

"Even by Hollywood standards Keira Knightley has experienced intense scrutiny over her body. Her slim frame became a defining point as she started to walk red carpets and appear in shoots as a young media star. And now the 29-year-old actress has spoken out about the constant manipulation of her body in photoshoots and claimed that it shouldn't matter what women look like. Scroll down for video . Keira Knightley, currently on the campaign trail for her latest film The Imitation Game in which she stars with Benedict Cumberbatch, has spoken out about the manipulation of her body in photoshoots . Speaking to The Times about a recent topless shoot for Interview magazine the actress said: 'I’ve had my body manipulated so many different times for so many different reasons, whether it’s paparazzi photographers or for film posters.' Referencing the fact that the dramatic shoot, appearing in the September issue of the magazine, displayed her small chest Keira says it was her intention to make a statement that her body shape or size doesn't matter. 'That [shoot] was one of the ones where I said: ""OK, I’m fine doing the topless shot so long as you don’t make them any bigger or retouch."" Because it does feel important to say it really doesn’t matter what shape you are.' The actress, who married musician James Righton last year, says: 'I think women’s bodies are a battleground and photography is partly to blame.' Keira appeared on The Jonathan Ross Show on Nov 1 in a pretty but demure dress . Turning philosophical the actress, who married musician James Righton last year, says: 'I think women’s bodies are a battleground and photography is partly to blame. Our society is so photographic now, it becomes more difficult to see all of those different varieties of shape.' The quotes reinforce a wariness of Hollywood and celebrity life that has come through in several of Keira's recent interviews. The British beauty has been uncharacteristically candid as she promotes her latest film, speaking out on issues such as gender inequality within the acting industry. 'The people who make movies, whether it's directors or producers, or money people, look for things that they can identify with and if they're all predominantly middle-aged white men, then what you see are things that middle-aged white men can identify with. And you don't get anything for anybody else,' she told net-a-porter's The Edit this month. Keira's body was digitally altered for promotional posters for King Arthur in 2004 . The 29-year-old's undeniably slim frame has meant constant scrutiny since she first appeared on the screen . In 2008 promotional posters for King Arthur in 2004  featured a Keira as a rather buxom pirate girl, and leaked images showed that her chest had been created with a bit of Hollywood fakery. Keira said: 'They painted my t**s on me for the films, which is extraordinary because it's kind of a dying art form - in the past, they used to have whole sections of the studios devoted to bosom make-up. 'And I loved it, completely loved it. Because it was the first time in my life I had big t**s, and I didn't even need surgery.' Although the star, who now leads a relatively normal life out of the public eye in north London with her husband, also claimed earlier this year that despite not regretting her own decision to go into acting she would be '150 million trillion percent' discouraging of any future daughter going into the business, citing the cruel jibes as a reason to avoid the industry.","The 29-year-old has faced scrutiny over her ultra slim frame for years .

"Fire chiefs are calling for safety messages to be displayed on electronic cigarettes after it was revealed the devices have caused more than 100 fires in less than two years. And in August, David Thomson, 62, was killed when an e-cigarette on charge exploded and ignited oxygen equipment he was believed to have been using. It was thought to be the first fatality from a fire involving an e-cigarette in Britain. Other incidents have resulted in people hurt and also reports of users' homes and cars being badly damaged. But the Local Government Association (LGA), which represents all 46 fire authorities in England and Wales, said the numbers could just be the 'tip of the iceberg' - warning many more cases may be going unreported. Scroll down for video . E-cigarette chargers have been linked to hundreds of fires and thought to cause at least one blaze every week . The charred remains of a charger that started a blaze which severely damaged a house . Many incidents are sparked by users connecting e-cigarettes to incompatible chargers - leading to melted appliances and in some cases, more serious devastation. The LGA wants manufacturers to do more to warn of the dangers, with possible measures to include placing prominent safety labels on products. Jeremy Hilton, chairman of the LGA's Fire Services Management Committee, said the upward trend of fires - thought to cause at least a blaze a week - is a 'major cause for concern'. He said: 'The spiralling upward trend of fires connected with e-cigarettes is a major cause for concern and much more needs to be done to combat it. 'We expect this to continue to rise as more smokers switch to e-cigarettes. 'Alarmingly, there is no way of knowing the true figure as we understand many cases are going unreported. 'We are urging e-cigarette manufacturers to introduce clear, prominent and graphic new warnings spelling out to users the dangers of using incompatible chargers with e-cigarette batteries.' Garry Brookes, of Rotherham, had an e-cigarette charging in his van, which burst into flames causing more than £35,000 worth of damage . Garry's Ford Transit van caught fire after an e-cigarette was lft on charge in Rotherham, South Yorkshire . Damage: A fire sparked by a charging e-cigarette, which had been plugged into a computer hard drive . Mr Hilton warned more deaths could follow unless action is taken. He said: 'Tragically, at least one life has been claimed and more fatalities could follow unless this issue is addressed rigorously and robustly. 'We are warning users that it is simply not worth risking their lives to save a few pounds by buying dodgy, dangerous or incompatible chargers.' Data from 43 fire services provided following a freedom of information request showed that since 2012 they had attended 113 calls to fires related to e-cigarette equipment. The figures indicated that brigades were attending incidents involving the technology, used by about 2.1 million Britons, at a rate of around one a week. From the services that provided data, e-cigarettes were cited as being involved in eight fires in 2012, rising to 43 last year, while there have been at least 62 so far this year. Barmaid Laura Baty was burned when her e-cigarette exploded while it was charging . Emma Apter, of the charity Electrical Safety First, said: 'We are becoming increasingly concerned about the number of incidents involving e-cigarettes. 'Recent events have shown that the simple act of charging one of these items can be deadly, so steps do need to be taken in order to make consumers more aware of the dangers. 'However, people can also help themselves in drastically reducing the risks. The advice is clear: do not use cheaper, unbranded chargers and do not leave e-cigarettes unattended whilst charging, especially overnight. 'By following this guidance, consumers can go a long way towards ensuring their own safety and that of their loved ones.'","David Thomson, 62, was killed after a charging e-cigarette exploded and ignited oxygen equipment .

"A mother has been arrested on murder charges after she allegedly threw her six-year-old autistic son from a bridge. Jillian Meredith McCabe, 34, of Seal Rock, Oregon, was in custody over the aggravated murder and first-degree manslaughter of her son London, NBC reported. The boy's body was found late on Monday night after a woman earlier reported throwing her son off the Yaquina Bay Bridge in Oregon at 6.30pm, police said on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . Jillian Meredith McCabe, 34, of Seal Rock, Oregon, has been arrested for the murder of her six-year-old son London She allegedly threw the boy from the Yaquina Bay Bridge in Oregon (pictured) Six-year-old London McCabe, who was diagnosed in 2011 with severe autism, was pictured proudly by his father Matt McCabe who suffers from multiple sclerosis . Father and son pictured after Mr McCabe was admitted to hospital last November. Mr McCabe was diagnosed with MS and also began treatment for having a mass in the brain stem . London McCabe was discovered in freezing waters about a mile from the bridge around four hours after his mother said she had thrown him in from about 100 feet up. The six-year-old's cause of death is not yet known. According to NBC, Mrs McCabe last year set up an online fundraising appeal to help care for her severely autistic son and husband, Matt, who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and having a mass on his brain stem in November 2013. Detectives were questioning the woman who made the 911 call on Monday evening. The head of police in the coastal community, Newport's Chief Mark Miranda, was on the scene and said that even if someone survived the fall, the cold water would kill in around 20 minutes. The Coast Guard and Lincoln County authorities searched for hours after the call came in about 6.25pm on Monday. Officers found a woman at the scene. Six-year-old London pictured last year in his father's hospital room as he received treatment after being diagnosed with MS . The body was found floating near a marina after being spotted by a witness from a restaurant close to the Yaquina Bay Bridge. The Coast Guard dispatched two boats and a helicopter to search the water. The county sheriff's marine patrol and county search and rescue teams were also involved. McCabe is being held on $750,000 bail. In 2011, Matt McCabe, who works for a marketing firm, posted a message on social media sharing the news that his son was 'severely autistic' but was receiving medication and treatment from therapists. Mr McCabe and his son, pictured enjoying a hike in 2012. Police confirmed on Monday that they had found the six-year-old's body and arrested Mr McCabe's wife Jillian . Jillian McCabe had separated from her husband (pictured right with their son) earlier this year, according to a blog post by him, but later reconciled . In November 2013, a YouCaring fundraising page called, Help Matt on the long Recovery Road, was set up by Jillian McCabe to help pay for hospital bills and long-term care. On the page, she wrote: 'My husband went from being able to walk/drive/work/make money/talk/throw our son in the air to being diagnosed with MS, having a mass in the brain stem, he is now walking with a walker, not being able to drive/work/make money, he now slurs his speech... 'Matt went from the sole bread winner and provider to not in a matter of 2 weeks.' The blog also mentioned a link to another blog, since shut down, called autisticlondon.com. Mrs McCabe went on to write that her husband was deeply worried about not having health insurance and medical bills. She wrote: 'Matt's laying in a hospital bed talking about the email project he was working on, complaining we don't have insurance, we don't have the money for hospital bills, he has a shopping cart website to work on...' She closed with the words: 'I NEED YOUR HELP.' The family raised close to $7,000 of a $50,000 target.

"Obesity places as great a burden on the global economy as  war and terrorism, costing $2 trillion each year. A rising tide of obesity is 'a critical global issue' that requires a 'comprehensive, international intervention strategy', researchers have claimed. More than 2.1 billion people across the world - around 30 per cent of the global population - are overweight or obese. And the epidemic shows no signs of decline. Experts predict if the current prevalence of obesity continues on its current trajectory, 'almost half the world's adult population will be overweight or obese by 2030'. Obesity places as great a burden on the global economy as war and terrorism, costing $2 trillion each year, a new study by experts at the McKinsey Global Institue has found . Researchers estimated if current obesity rates continue, almost half the world's adult population will be overweight or obese by 2030 . A report by McKinsey&Company, which studied 44 different ways of combating obesity, found the global impact is the equivalent to smoking or armed violence, war and terrorism. In the UK the burden on the economy is £47 billion a year - greater than the impact of armed violence, war and terrorism - while in the U.S. it is £663 billion. The researchers have called on global governments, healthcare systems, retailers and food and drinks manufacturers to 'coordinate' their response to tackle the crisis head on. They said while the severity of the global obesity crisis is 'beyond doubt', there are interventions that are very effective. The majority of the weight-loss programmes and policies studied 'are cost-effective at a societal level and could potentially have a high impact'. Among the interventions researchers studied were subsidised school meals for all, calorie and nutrition labelling, restrictions on advertising high-calorie food and drinks, and public health campaigns. The study explored 44 different interventions being implemented across the globe, including: . They found no single intervention alone was likely to have a significant overall impact on obesity rates. Rather, 'a systemic, sustained portfolio of initiatives, delivered at scale, is needed to reverse the health burden'. While better education and personal responsibility were identified as 'critical elements' of a programme to tackle obesity, they were not sufficient on their own. Researchers said policies and steps that rely less on the conscious choices of individuals, and more on changes to their environment are needed. They include reducing default portion sizes, changing marketing practised and restructuring urban and education environments to facilitate more physical activity. The report said: 'Obesity is a major global economic problem caused by a multitude of factors. 'Today obesity is jostling with armed conflict and smoking in terms of having the greatest human-generated global economic impact. 'The global economic impact of obesity is increasing. The evidence suggests that the economic and societal impact of obesity is deep and lasting.' In the UK the burden on the economy is £47 billion a year - greater than the impact of armed violence, war and terrorism. In the U.S. the cost to the economy is $663 billion a year . In the UK, obesity has the second largest impact after smoking, while in the U.S. obesity came second to armed violence, war and terrorism, researchers found . They found obesity has the same impact on the global economy as armed conflict and terrorism, and just 'a shade less than smoking'. 'In most developed economies, obesity ranks among the top three human-generated economic burdens.' In the UK, obesity has the second largest impact after smoking, generating an economic loss of more than £44 billion a year in 2012. The report found the economic impact from smoking in the UK was £57 billion in 2012, while the country suffered a £43 billion annual loss from armed violence, war and terrorism. In the U.S. armed conflict, especially spending on the military, has the highest impact, with obesity second. Obesity cost the U.S. economy $663billion a year in 2012. They predict a series of 44 interventions could bring 20 per cent of overweight or obese people in the UK back to normal weight within five to 10 years. It would save around £16 billion a year in UK, including an annual saving of about £766 million in the NHS, according to the study. More than 2.1 billion people across the world are overweight or obese and that number is growing . One in 12 of the global adult population has type 2 diabetes, 'which is at least partly driven by obesity' The study found the UK Government's efforts to tackle obesity were 'too fragmented to be effective', while investment in obesity prevention was 'relatively low given the scale of the problem.' The UK spends less than £638 million a year on obesity prevention programmes - about 1 per cent of the country's social cost of obesity, researchers said. But the country spends about £6 billion a year on the medical costs of conditions related to being overweight or obese and a further £10 billion on diabetes. Meanwhile, the cost of obesity and diabetes to the NHS is equivalent to the UK's combined 'protection' budget for the police and fire services, law courts, and prisons. The current rate of obesity and overweight conditions suggest the cost to the NHS could increase from between £6 billion and £8 billion in 2015 to between £10 billion and £12 billion in 2030, the study found. But the authors  acknowledge combating obesity 'will not be easy'. For fast action, that is effective, the researchers said more co-operation is needed between public and private sectors. They said: 'They (authorities) cannot focus too heavily on debating which interventions should be prioritised and they should be prepared to engage in trial and error to reach an understanding of which approaches are likely to be most effective. 'We see the last piece of the jigsaw puzzle being more investment in obesity prevention and in research.' Overall obesity prevalence appears to be linked to a country's wealth, the researchers found. Among the G-20 nations with per capital GDP exceeding $8,000, only Japan and South Korea have prevalence rates lower than 16 per cent. The majority of G-20 countries have rates of more than 20 per cent . 'There is huge scope to rein in the rising trend of obesity acorss the world - and to do so ina cost-effective way. 'Above all, boldness is imperative. Nothing else with mitigate the huge and rising human, social and economic costs of this crisis.' MGI director Richard Dobbs said: 'Efforts to address obesity have been piecemeal up till now. 'Yet obesity is a systemic issue, born of many interlocking factors, and only a systemic response will do.' Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said: 'Overweight and obesity is a complex problem which requires action across individual and societal levels involving industry, national and local government and the voluntary sector. There is no single 'silver bullet' solution. 'Today 25 per cent of the nation is obese and 37 per cent is overweight. If we reduce obesity to 1993 levels, where 15 per cent of the population were obese, we will avoid five million disease cases and save the NHS alone an additional £1.2 billion by 2034. 'PHE will continue to support local authorities to provide effective weight management services, to influence the regulation of fast food outlets and provide healthier catering in hospitals and schools, which will all help people to lose weight.' Professor Jimmy Bell, an obesity expert at the University of Westminster, said he believes the report 'shockingly' underestimates the total cost of obesity. He said it fails to include the spiralling costs to companies and Governments for accommodating overweight and obese people. The study examined the effects of 44 different interventions to help reduce obesity levels, including healthier school meals and investing in parental education . He said: 'Hospital beds and ambulances now need to be strengthened to carry overweight people and even buses, trains, airplanes and entertainment venues need to install bigger and reinforced seating to cope with a society growing in size. 'Governments need to replicate laws imposed on the tobacco industry to label food highlighting the life threatening dangers of consuming products with a high fat, calorie and sugar content; otherwise the obesity situation will get much worse. 'The global food supply is not inexhaustible and the current increase in demand is unsustainable. People in emerging markets, particularly Asia, are now consuming larger more calorific helpings of food and demand may soon exceed supply. 'Obese people are also likely to have obese pets due to over feeding and lack of exercise.'","More than 2.1 billion people across the world are overweight or obese .

"On Sunday evening, an asteroid the size of a house soared past the Earth and may have released shards of meteorite into our atmosphere. One such fragment is believed to have created a crater 39-ft wide (20 metres) in Nicaragua - but what would have happened if the asteroid itself had struck the Earth? The Killer Asteroids project was set up to answer such questions, and calculates how far and wide the spread of damage would be if a space rock collided with our planet. Scroll down for video . The Killer Asteroids project was funded by Washington’s National Science Foundation (NSF) and Nasa. Using a Google Earth plugin, the interactive calculator lets users select the type of projectile, either a comet or asteroid, as well as its size; small, medium and large. For the purposes of the project, the small asteroid is listed as the size of a school bus, around 8ft (2.4 metres) wide, and made of iron. The medium, stony asteroid is listed as being three times the size of a football field, approximately 1,080 ft (329 metres). While the large asteroid is listed as 6,336ft wide (1,931 metres) and travelling at approximately 12miles a second (20km). The small ‘miniature icy’ comet in the simulation is 360ft wide (109 metres) and is moving at 30 miles a second (50km). The medium comet is also made of ice and is travelling at 30 miles a second (50km), but is 3,166ft (965 metres) wide. The largest icy comet in the project is 31,680ft (9,656 metres). Users can select any of these projectiles, before choosing from one of 15 locations. The project was funded by Washington’s National Science Foundation (NSF) and Nasa.

Users can select any of these projectiles, before choosing from one of 15 locations where the impact will take place. Alternatively, they can select a random location. After pressing 'go', a simulated animation is shown hitting the chosen location, with a warning about the aftermath. For example, a large comet crashing into Atlanta in Georgia would throw enough debris into the air to ‘darken the skies.’ The map reveals that this kind of projectile could cause an ‘extinction event’, that is said to have killed off the dinosaurs, but ‘happily these may only occur every billion years or so.’ A small asteroid hitting London would create a crater that spreads past St James’ Park in the west, and Tower Bridge in the east. Buildings as far south as South Lambeth would fall over, but the impact would only affect those in this range. This simulation shows the impact a medium asteroid hitting London would create. People in Southend on Sea, Reading, Brighton and up to Cambridge would suffer first degree burns. Residents of Slough, Dartford and Leatherhead would have their clothes set on fire. Steel buildings would be destroyed as far west as Hounslow and the crater would decimate the entire central London . A large comet hitting New York, for example, would create devastation across the east coast of the US, and people in Illinois and Ottawa in Canada would suffer first degree burns . Alternatively, a medium asteroid hitting the same spot would spread much further. People in Southend-on-Sea, Reading, Brighton and up to Cambridge would suffer first degree burns. Residents of Slough, Dartford and Leatherhead would have their clothes set on fire.

A large comet hitting New York, for example, would create devastation across the east coast of the US, and people in Illinois and Ottawa in Canada would suffer first degree burns. All of these estimates were based on calculations devised by Professor Robert Marcus and his team at Purdue University, London. His online calculator lets users customise the size and speed of projectiles. Using the size of the asteroid 2014 RC (pictured), and making estimations about its speed, angle and density, if it was to hit Earth it would begin to breakup at an altitude of 207,000 ft (63100 metres). The air blast would arrive approximately 1.17 minutes after impact and sound intensity would be 51dB, or as loud as heavy traffic if you were stood a kilometre away. The asteroid was reported as passing closest to earth at approximately 7.18pm BST (2.18pm EST) over New Zealand on Sunday . One meteorite, believed to have been a shard of the asteroid 2014 RC, created a crater 39-ft wide (20 metres) in Nicaragua (pictured). The meteorite, which may have splintered from the asteroid, is said to have hurtled into a wooded area near the airport around midnight, and the hit was so large that it registered on the instruments Strauss's organisation uses to measure earthquakes . Using the size of the asteroid 2014 RC, and making estimations about its speed, angle and density, if it was to hit Earth it would begin to breakup at an altitude of 207,000 ft (63100 metres). It would burst into a cloud of fragments at an altitude of 75,700 ft (23,100 metres). The air blast would arrive approximately 1.17 minutes after impact and sound intensity would be 51dB, or as loud as heavy traffic if you were stood a kilometre away.

"An adventurous British biker on a record-breaking ride around the world took a breather from her arduous 56,000-mile journey today to celebrate becoming a grandmother. Steph Jeavons, 38, is halfway through her record-breaking feat to become the first woman to ride a motorbike across every continent on earth. She set off from her home in Old Conwy, North Wales, knowing her son Nathan, 20, and his partner were expecting a baby. Ms Jeavons was on her motorbike 'Rhonda the Honda' in India when she was told her granddaughter Alexis had arrived. She said: 'Jaipur shall always be remembered with fondness as the place I received the news that I had become a grandmother. 'That was pretty emotional I can tell you. 'I would have loved to fly back just for a hug but this was always going to happen and even if my budget allowed, it would probably make it too hard to leave again. 'A Skype call had to suffice. Alexis is beautiful.' Ms Jeavons poses in Dubai in front of the towering skyscrapers that dominate the skyline . Ms Jeavons also  rode around India and she said she has been welcomed warmly throughout her journey . Ms Jeavons gruelling 56,000-mile journey will take her through 42 countries on a daily food budget of just £5 a day. She kick-started her attempt to circumnavigate the world on her trusty 250 CRF Honda in March this year - and is traveling with just 35kg of bare essentials. Ms Jeavons  is relying on people's kindness in each country she rides through to provide an occasional comfy bed and some food when she is not camping in her tiny tent. She is currently riding through the South East Asian country of Laos after having made it through France, Belgium, Germany, The Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey. Ms Jeavons enjoys the views of the Indian countryside during her round the world trip . The 38 year-old has found friends and accommodation easy to come by  during her travels in India . Ms Jeavons has also followed the tourist trail and she has visited a multitude of tourist attractions around India . Ms Jeavons then rode through Iran - where women are not allowed to drive - with her head covered by a a Hijab before sailing to Dubai and flying into India. She has already survived riding through a civil war in East Turkey and deadly stampedes during an Indian pilgrimage. The lone rider survived driving along the deadly Indian roads where around 650 people died a day in accidents, and rode 18,380 feet up the highest driveable road in the world on the Khardung La in the Himalayas, before entering Nepal and flying into Thailand to continue her motorbike journey overland through South East Asia. Ms Jeavons' travels will then see her ride through Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and East Timor before sailing to Australia and riding across the southern continent. Ms Jeavons is planning to sail to Antarctica on with her motorbike lashed to the deck . Before she departed Old Conwy in North Wales Ms Jeavons was waved off by family and friends . The adventurer has occasionally rode horseback as well as on her trusted motorbike during her travels . Ms Jeavons has seen some remarkable scenery and landscapes during her record breaking attempt . Ms Jeavons is hoping to make it to the southern tip of Argentina by the end of January to catch IceBird - the Australian-owned yacht she will sail to Antarctica on with her motorbike lashed to the deck - in her bid to enter the record books. And after her icy adventure she will leave the tip of Argentina and ride up the backbone of South America and through Central America before entering the USA and Canada on her final stretch before flying home into Britain. Ms Jeavons said the journey so far had been beyond her wildest dreams and she had seen some unforgettable sights and had been heartened by the kindness of strangers. She said: 'It has certainly been life changing in many ways. Everyday is a new experience and new people. 'I have now ridden through 17 different countries and covered 15,000 miles in just over 5 months. The Old Conwy resident has travelled far and wide in her ambitious and far-flung solo adventure . Ms Jeavons said the journey so far had been amazing  and she had seen some unforgettable sights . 'I am learning with each new experience about myself, the countries I visit and most importantly that the majority of people are kind and helpful and our biggest fears are generally unfounded.' The new grandmother said the journey had been a 'roller coaster of emotions' and she was loving the extreme challenges thrown at her. She said: 'You can't be on a high every day. Some days it can be a lonely experience, particularly when no one around you speaks English. 'But I am loving the challenge. Even the bad times or the scary bits. 'Getting through them is what fuels my motivation and makes me stronger. It has certainly lived up to my expectations and more.'","Welsh rider is halfway through her 56,000-mile journey covering 42 countries .

"As authorities attempt to contain home-grown terrorists and stop them from leaving the country, it seems some  have still managed to slip through the cracks. Australian Federal Police commissioner Neil Gaughan told a parliamentary committee on Thursday that a group of people managed to leave the country this week, but were 'not on anyone's radar', the Guardian reported. 'We got wind of it after the fact, but the fact is there are still people travelling,' said Gaughan - the national manager of counter-terrorism for the Australian Federal Police. Scroll down for video . More Australians have slipped through the cracks and fled overseas to join the fight with Islamic State . This comes just days ahead of the G20 summit to be held in Brisbane, which will be attended by a large number of world leaders. According to The Daily Telegraph, counter terrorism officers have been deployed to all Australian international airports. Gaughan also told the committee he believed that federal police officers needed greater controls urgently, so they were better able to track the movements and interactions of suspects. Authorities argue they need more tools to monitor suspects and prevent them from being radicalised . Many foreign fighters have already left the country including Mohamed Elomar (pictured) 'But the fact is there’s still people travelling and regardless of what we’re doing, we’re not stopping that so we need some other tools,' he said, according to The Telegraph. Thought he did not reveal from where or to what destination the group travelled, Gaughan said officers are now virtually powerless to stop them unless they resurface elsewhere. 'Unfortunately, once they get into Syria or into Iraq, there is nothing the AFP can do except wait for them to basically pop their head up somewhere on the way back.' Khaled Sharrouf is also fighting with IS militants in the Middle East, and made headlines when he posted a photo of his young son brandishing a severed head . Australian Federal Police commissioner Neil Gaughan speaking at the investigation into new legislation in Canberra on Thursday . Gaughan was speaking at an investigation into new legislation which aims to give security agencies power to issue control orders on people who are enabling or supporting terrorism. He also revealed that authorities were struggling to keep up with the sheer number of people being radicalised in such a short time - often less than six months. Authorities said the ability to put restrictions on who suspects can communicate with and where they can go would allow them to greatly reduce the change of an attack on home soil.","A group of Australians left the country undetected this week .

"Alive and kicking: Faye Dunaway, 72, is as healthy as an ancient 30-year-old, scientists have said . Here's the good news – 72 is the new 30. The bad news? It doesn’t quite mean you’ll be wrinkle-free in your eighth decade. Scientists have found that a primitive hunter gatherer at 30 would have had the same odds of dying as a 72-year-old in a developed country does now. And over the course of 8,000 generations of humans, the biggest drop in mortality has occurred in the past four. Since 1840, the life expectancy of a newborn baby in a Western industrialised nation has risen by around three months each year. Lifespans are now beyond 80 in some developed nations, thanks to improved medicine and nutrition. The Max Planck Institute for Demographic . Research in Rostock, Germany, say that modern healthcare and medicines are responsible for increased life expectancies. Researchers have studied the death rates of hunter-gatherers whose way of life has not changed for generations. They looked at tribal people in Australia, Africa, South America and the Philippines and found that at 30-years-old, these people had the same chance of dying as Japanese people aged 72. Growing old: Women in Japan and Sweden were found to be in the healthiest Western nations at 72 . CHUCK NORRIS . PENELOPE KEITH . RAQUEL WELCH . AL PACINO . MARTIN SHEEN . NEIL DIAMOND . Comparing hunter gatherers with the . long-lived Japanese, the authors led by Dr Oskar Burger, wrote: . ‘Hunter-gatherers at age 30 have the same probability of death as . present-day Japanese at the age of 72.' In fact, hunter-gatherer death rates . were closer to those of chimpanzees than to citizens of Japan or Sweden, . the research showed. Since about 1840, life spans in the longest-lived populations have increased by about three months per year, said the researchers. Most of the death-rate reduction had occurred since 1900 and been experienced by only about four of the roughly 8,000 human generations that have ever lived. Up to the age of around 15, hunter-gatherers had death rates more than 100 times higher than those seen in modern-day Japan and Sweden. Across the whole of their life spans they had a more than 10-fold greater likelihood of dying. Hunter-gatherer death rates and those of people in Sweden were much closer in 1900 than they are today, said the scientists. The increase in human life expectancy had been largely achieved 'by removing environmental shocks, by making injuries and illnesses less fatal with medical technology, and by enhancing health at older ages by improving nutrition and reducing disease at younger ages'. The findings are published in the journal Proceedings Of The National Academy Of Sciences.","Hominids - early humans - had the same life expectancy at 30 as a 72-year-old living now .

"Benefits Street has been cleared of breaching broadcasting rules despite sparking more than 900 complaints. The controversial Channel 4 show prompted a furore in January from viewers who claimed it was 'poverty porn' which misrepresented benefit claimants across Britain. But broadcasting watchdog Ofcom ruled the show about James Turner Street, Birmingham, was clearly a portrayal of one street and not wider society. Scroll down for video . Furore: The Channel 4 show Benefits Street, which included controversial welfare claimant 'White' Dee Kelly (pictured), has been cleared of breaching Ofcom's guidelines despite sparking more than 900 complaints . The watchdog admitted parts of the show would offend some viewers but said: 'The beginning of every episode in the . series included an introduction in which the narrator stated: ""James . Turner Street in Birmingham is not your average street…and most of the . residents are claiming benefits."" 'The aim of the series was therefore . presented as being a record of the daily lives of some of the residents . of this particular road to inform viewers about their lives and their . community. 'Ofcom’s view was that it would have been clear to viewers, . over the course of the series, that this was an observational . documentary about the experiences of one community. 'Therefore, after careful consideration, we . concluded that overall Channel 4 ensured there was sufficient context . over the course of the series to justify the offence and that it applied . generally accepted standards.' The series was a ratings hit for . Channel 4 but drew criticism for allegedly demonising those living on . the breadline. It caused a stir when it was screened . and prompted discussion in Parliament as well as public meetings in the . area where some of those featured claimed they were misrepresented. Ruling: Ofcom said the portrayal of James Turner Street (pictured) was not meant to reflect all of Britain . The vast majority of complaints - 887 - were about the way . those on benefits were portrayed. Some 23 viewers also raised fears about . children and young people featured in the show and the care which was . given by programme makers for their welfare and dignity. Ofcom also ruled in Channel 4's favour on these complaints, none of which were from those featured in the show, saying: 'After a thorough assessment of the evidence, . Ofcom found sufficient steps were taken before, during and after . production to protect the welfare of the children that appeared in the . programme and that any potentially offensive material was justified by . the context in which it was presented. 'Ofcom has therefore concluded . that the series did not breach its rules.' There . were also 40 complaints about the programmes demonstrating criminal . techniques, including shoplifting. But Ofcom said it was . satisfied that there was an editorial justification for their inclusion . and there were not enough details for people to copy the techniques. Controversy: James Turner Street in Birmingham became the subject of a national debate in January . A Channel 4 spokesman said: 'We welcome Ofcom's finding that Benefits Street did not breach the code in any respect. 'We are proud that our robust duty of care protocols for the child contributors have been praised for ""demonstrating best practice"", and for the recognition that we 'ensured the interests of the under-18s who featured in Benefits Street were protected and that due care was applied before, during and after production. 'Ofcom noted that the series ""illustrated important issues facing some children living in contemporary Britain"" and that ""the children's welfare was at the heart of the production"".'","C4 show sparked complaints over 'skewed' portrayal of people on benefits .

"This was the moment an angry ram let off some steam by taking out a flying drone with his horns and knocking it TO the ground in New Zealand. The up close and personal footage was filmed by YouTube user Buddhanz1 using a quadcopter drone and has been viewed 68,029 times. Buddhanz1, who has nicknamed the animal Rambo, says on the YouTube channel he was looking for a newborn lamb whose mum cannot produce enough milk. YouTube user Buddhanz1 says he was looking for a baby lamb with his flying camera . The video starts by showing the beautiful rolling hills of the countryside before zooming into the area where Rambo is having a grassy snack. He starts to examine the camera as it closes in as he is trying to finish his leaf lunch. It seems he didn't take too kindly to being interrupted and after a few inquisitive stares he looks like he is taking a few steps back before he lurches forward twice and takes out the drone with his horns. The footage then cuts to the owner of the drone walking towards the ram saying 'Rambo the ram, what are you doing boy, where is it?' But instead he stumbled across Rambo who  is just having lunch when he is interrupted by the spy camera . He takes an inquisitive look at what the device is that is capturing his every move before ramming it into a bush . The cameraman then locates the broken drone in a bush nearby. When he starts to leave the pilot is seen being chased by Rambo who doesn't seem too happy. The pilot tells Rambo to 'settle down boy' several times and is seen trying to keep him at arms length with a stick. Some viewers have not taken too kindly to the video, Kenneth Heal5 said: 'You have a duty of care and respect to ensure you don't fly that low. 'Ending up that low is either negligence, incompetence or both. Guess u got your punishment already though.' Rambo gets up close and personal with the camera before using his horns to show what he thinks . Buddhanz1 defended himself saying: 'I was looking for the angry ram with my FPV quadcopter. 'I got a bit close & he managed to hit it knocking it into a bush, luckily no harm done. 'When I went to retrieve it he followed me, I had my hands full so he got me pretty good.'","The ram nicknamed Rambo was being followed by a flying camera drone  in the New Zealand countryside .

"View point: Professor John Ashton, president of the Faculty of Public Health, says people should be enabled to end their life where the alternative would cause 'major' suffering . Patients should be helped to die by their GP if they so wish, a leading doctor has said. Professor John Ashton, president of the Faculty of Public Health, has said in his view people should be enabled to end their life where the alternative would cause ‘major’ suffering. Professor Ashton, who has spent almost 40 years working in public health,  is one of the most senior health professionals to speak out in favour of assisted suicide. He told The Guardian: ‘All over the country people are spending their last days and weeks in major discomfort because their medical carers are not willing to accept that it’s the end of the line and to give them the necessary sedation to just speed things up a bit. ‘I think a significant proportion of the population would like to feel confident that if it came to the crunch they could call on their doctor to help them out … if their quality of life is so poor and that it’s only a matter of days or weeks anyway, that they would like to be able to draw down that gift of a [medical] practitioner.’ The veteran public health expert, who retired last year, stressed he was speaking in a personal capacity on the subject but said he would be content for doctors ‘to stop treatment, to be more ready to prescribe the sort of medication … that means they will be more likely to [die] sooner rather than later.’ Professor Ashton, who leads more than 3,300 public health experts working in the NHS, local government and academia,  added: ‘When doctors take this strident view that doctors won’t get involved in this in any way I don’t think they are in tune with what the public want to be able to get from their advisers. There is a narrow line between actively taking someone’s life and supporting their passing, and that’s the art of medicine. ‘Personally, I would like that for myself if I was in this position. I would like to be able to call on a doctor to help me take this last step.’ The doctor’s controversial comments came as he also said Britain should switch to a four-day working week to combat stress. Combat stress: Prof Ashton also said Britain should switch to a four-day working week, adding that workers no longer took a lunch hour and ate at their desks . He said shorter hours would allow workers to spend more time with their families and would help combat medical conditions such as high blood pressure and mental health problems. ‘We should be moving towards a four-day week because we problem we have in the world of work is you’ve got a proportion who are working too hard and a proportion that haven’t got jobs,’ he said. ‘We’ve got a maldistribution of work.  The lunch-hour has gone; people just have a sandwich at their desk and carry on working.’ ‘We need a four-day week so that people can enjoy their lives, have more time with their families and maybe reduce high blood pressure because people might start exercising on that extra day. ‘If you’ve got two people in a couple working, they need to be able to work in such a way that they can spend time together with their children.  It’s a nightmare.’","Professor John Ashton, president of the Faculty of Public Health is one of most senior health workers to speak out in favour of assisted suicide .
