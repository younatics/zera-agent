"English referee Howard Webb found himself at the centre of a bitter storm between Brazil and Chile last night ahead of taking charge of the first knockout game of the tournament in Belo Horizonte. Webb, who came in for some criticism in the wake of the last World Cup final, faced further questions from the Chileans, who fear he may not be strong enough not to favour the host nation. Barcelona star Alexis Sanchez said: ‘What worries me most about this game is the referee.’ The Chile FA president is also reported to have expressed concern that Webb would buckle under the considerable pressure at the Estadio Mineirao. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sanchez say he is worried about the referee for last 16 clash . Top of his game: Webb is highly regarded in his role by FIFA but Chile have raised concerns about him . Doubts: Alexis Sanchez reflected the views of some Chileans by stating his concern about Webb as ref . Unimpressed: But Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari dismissed talk as being disrespectful towards Brazil . That sparked an angry reaction at Brazil’s press conference, with their federation’s director of communications, Rodrigo Paiva, taking to the stage to deliver a speech. When Brazil manager Luiz Felipe Scolari was told by a Chilean journalist that Chile’s ‘president and players are worried’, a ranting Paiva intervened. ‘We’ll talk about it only once,’ he said as Scolari and Brazil captain Thiago Silva looked on. ‘It’s something that’s immature. This kind of pressure is ridiculous. ‘Talking about this is not a lack of respect to FIFA or the referee or the people who work here with 100 years of winning history. It’s a lack of respect to the Brazil people. ‘We don’t need a referee to win a match, it’s insulting. That’s all the CBF will say on the matter.’ Contentious: Brazil were awarded a dubious penalty in their opening game against Croatia as Fred went down . Big dog: Webb took charge of the World Cup final in 2010 but was criticised by the Spanish media . Experience: Webb has already covered the Colombia v Ivory Coast game at this World Cup . It did nothing to ease the tension before what is a huge game for Brazil. Scolari spoke of ‘anxiety and nerves’. Silva said all the players were suffering under a burden of expectation playing a World Cup here in Brazil. He said it was only because of Scolari — their rock as well as their coach — that they were ready for what promises to be a fascinating encounter with the much-fancied Chile. ‘It’s impossible to shut off what this means,’ said the Paris Saint-Germain defender. ‘But this guy beside me is very special for us, even at a difficult moment, family issues, he’s always there for us. In fact I need to stop talking because I’m a big cry baby and it might happen here.’ Friends: Thiago Silva was very big on his praise for the Brazil boss ahead of their last 16 tie .","Chileans fear Webb isn't strong enough .

"Former Real Madrid defender and captain Fernando Hierro will take over from Zinedine Zidane as coach Carlo Ancelotti's assistant, the La Liga club said on Thursday. Real announced last week that former France captain Zidane would manage the club's reserve team, Castilla, next season.

"Lewis Hamilton apologised to his fans after blowing his chance of securing pole position for the British Grand Prix after inexplicably aborting his final run in Saturday's dramatic qualifying session. Hamilton appeared set to secure his second pole in as many years in front of his home crowd with track conditions seemingly worsening in the rain-hit session. But as his title rival Nico Rosberg snatched pole in the final moments, Hamilton chose to bail out of his last lap, confident he had done enough to start Sunday's race from the front of the pack. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lewis Hamilton: From karting kid to world champion . Costly mistake: Lewis Hamilton's error means he will start Sunday's British Grand Prix from sixth place . Lonely walk: Lewis Hamilton trudges back to the pit lane after qualifying for the British Grand Prix . Wet conditions: Qualifying for the British Grand Prix was affected by rain during Saturday . The final sector of the circuit had . however dried out, with not only Rosberg going faster than the Briton, . but four other drivers, meaning Hamilton will only start sixth at . Silverstone on Sunday. He later admitted: 'I made a mistake today, a bad call that decided my qualifying. I'm so sorry to all the amazing fans. I'll push all the way for them tomorrow.' Rosberg will be joined on the front row by . reigning World Champion Sebastian Vettel with Jenson Button, yet to . secure a podium in 14 previous attempts at Silverstone, third on the . grid. The Force India of Nico Hulkenberg was fourth fastest with McLaren's Kevin Magnussen next up and ahead of Hamilton. It . is the third qualifying blunder from Hamilton in as many races. He . started behind Rosberg in Canada after making an error on his final lap . in Montreal. He then spun during the dying moments of qualifying last . time out in Austria. Top three (from left): Jenson Button, Nico Rosberg and Sebastian Vettel will head the field for Sunday's race . Fitting: Button celebrates claiming a place in the top three as he wore a helmet in tribute to his late father . After starting ninth at the Red Bull Ring he . fought back through the field to finish second, and he will need a . similar virtuoso drive to restrict the damage caused by his qualifying . howler here. 'I don't have anything to say at the moment,' a dumbfounded Hamilton said afterwards. His . boss Paddy Lowe added:  'He felt the lap was worse and bailed out which . is unfortunate. There was lot of time to be found in sector three.' Even . if Hamilton recovers to finish second on Sunday - in what is expected . to be a dry race - and Rosberg wins, it will see the German extend his . lead in the championship to 36 points at the midway stage of the season. There was also big shock in the first phase of this most surprising . of qualifying sessions with the Ferrari pair of Fernando Alonso and . Kimi Raikkonen, and the Williams duo of Valtteri Botts and Felipe . Massa,  eliminated from qualifying in Q1. Plenty to ponder: Fernando Alonso was left to think after he was eliminated in the first session . Final standings: Nico Rosberg topped the charts after Q3 on Saturday . Alonso took to the circuit . on slick tyres, but as more rain fell in the final minutes of the . 18-minute opening session, it appeared to catch the Spaniard out as he . was sent sideways in his Ferrari. It means he will start only 19th for . tomorrow's race with team-mate Kimi Raikkonen one place worse off. 'I . think it happens sometimes in this weather,' Alonso said afterwards. 'Thirty seconds later you put on the right tyre and you are a hero. We . are here with two Ferraris and two Williams' so we did something wrong . compared to other teams but we wouldn't do anything differently. 'At the moment it is unpredictable. We will start at the back with some overtakes to do, so we have nothing to lose.' Williams' failure to progress through to the second stage of qualifying caps a miserable weekend for the British outfit. All over: Wolff was forced to retire from the first practice session after an engine failure in her Williams . Dramatic: Williams teammate Felipe Massa crashed out in a rather more spectacular way during practice . Getting carried away: Massa's car is removed from the track but Williams managed to repair it quickly . Susie . Wolff, the first female racer at a grand prix weekend in 22 years, . lasted just four laps in practice on Friday while Massa then suffered a . huge shunt during the same session. It is in stark contrast to their . performance last time out in Austria where they secured a front-row . lockout with Massa having claimed his first pole in six years. Bottas . ultimately finished third; the team's only podium finish of the season . to date. The Marussia pair of Jules Bianchi and Max Chilton both . shined in the inclement conditions. Indeed the impressive young . Frenchman topped the timesheets temporarily in Q2. He will start 12th. As . for Chilton, it was a personal best for him in qualifying, finishing . behind team-mate Bianchi in 13th. He will however, start five places . back down the grid after serving a grid penalty for a gearbox change. Sauber . saw both their drivers Adrian Sutil, in Q1, and Esteban Gutierrez in . the ensuing session end up in the barriers following spins.

"Click here for your brilliant Match Zone inlcuding Paul Pogba's heat map . The nation that departed the last World Cup amid calamity is quietly making its case as one of the prime contenders at this one. France, who left South Africa in chaos, shame and recriminations after the squad mutinied against the manager, progressed to the quarter-finals yesterday against a spirited Nigeria team. And while never sparkling, they were unfussily efficient, benefiting greatly from the 62nd-minute replacement of Olivier Giroud with Antoine Griezmann, which changed the attacking dynamic of the match. And Paul Pogba, who has been under a degree of pressure, with some urging Didier Deschamps to drop him, demonstrated some of the reasons why Juventus will demand £60million for him should he be sold. He hasn’t yet managed to be the midfield fulcrum for which the team yearn, but his headed goal after 79 minutes yesterday might yet make him the toast of France.

For Deschamps, it represented a degree . of vindication. ‘Paul is young and I think it’s normal that he’s been . criticised,’ said the manager. ‘It’s . part of a high-level footballer’s life. Sometimes it’s painful, . sometimes it’s unfair but it will toughen him up. And he stood up today . and showed his potential. 'Maybe he played more simply than usually and all credit to him. I didn’t doubt his ability.’ Nigeria, . who had initially looked the more vibrant and incisive of the teams, . could count themselves a little unlucky, not least their impressive . goalkeeper, Vincent Enyeama. He . has been one of the outstanding players and characters of this . tournament and his excellent form continued here at the National Stadium . up until the 79th minute, when his handling error allowed Pogba to open . the scoring. ‘I don’t . know why he padded the ball from the corner,’ said his coach Stephen . Keshi. ‘His decision is final and what happened, happened. It cost us . big.’ Even France’s . second — a Joseph Yobo own goal from close range, under pressure from .

Still, . though France weathered difficult periods, they were in control from . the moment Giroud was withdrawn and Griezmann restored their attacking . balance, with Karim Benzema moving into the centre. In . fact it proved an inglorious afternoon for the Arsenal striker, who was . fortunate that the referee appeared not to see his elbow aimed at John . Mikel Obi. There was no . mistaking who the locals wanted to win, with the  stadium echoing to . chants of ‘Nigeria! Nigeria!’ and the small knots of French fans who . tried to make their voice heard invariably provoking whistles. The . Nigerians had insisted before the game that the dispute over . £2.25million in bonus payments had been quickly forgotten and so it . seemed as they started at a pace and with a degree of incision which . suggested they expected to win.

And . it appeared the early pressure had paid dividends when Musa curled in a . excellent  near-post cross which Emenike slid in to convert past . Lloris. However, referee Mark Geiger correctly ruled it out for a very tight offside. Nigeria were dominant in  midfield, with Mikel and Ogenyi Onazi establishing control, and were quick going forward. Onazi in particular was targeted, first by Pogba and later by Blaise Matuidi, whose challenge ended his match. Keshi . said: ‘On two occasions Onazi had very bad tackles and nothing was . done. The referee was bad and this is the first time I speak about the . referee as a coach.’ Committed: Matuidi comes in late to win the ball from Onazi and catches the Nigeria midfielder .

On the run: Victor Moses charges past France left back Patrice Evra as the winger starts an attack for Nigeria . That said, Keshi’s displeasure had partly been incurred by the  disallowed goal, a correct decision. Though . they were suffering, France had the best chance of the first half, . Pogba exchanging passes with Valbuena and hitting a superb volley that . flew straight at Enyeama. Mathieu . Debuchy should have done better on 40 minutes and Lloris was forced . into a sharp save from Emenike’s strike as the half ended. The . pace waned after the break, yet Nigeria still made most of the running, . with Odemwingie and Emenike keen to test Lloris from long range. But Griezmann brought fresh verve. With 20 minutes left, he exchanged passes with Benzema, who shot at Enyeama. The . goalkeeper saved but the ball rebounded off the striker and headed . goalwards until Victor Moses scrambled back to hook it off the line. France suddenly looked the more dangerous side. Yohan Cabaye hit a delightful strike from 25 yards that rebounded off the bar. Then . came the Valbuena corner, which saw Enyeama flap and Pogba head home. France were in the ascendant and when Valbuena played in his cross and . Griezmann pressured Yobo into turning into his own net, the game was . already done.

"Yearbook quotes tend to prove over-ambitious or untrue, but for America's World Cup hero it was just about right. 'It will take a nation of millions to held me back' was the quote attributed to a youthful 'Timothy' Howard.

"When it comes to golfing achievements, there’s no better company to keep than Tiger Woods and Sir Nick Faldo, and Justin Rose found himself linked with both following his gutsy play-off success in the PGA Tour event staged in America’s capital on Sunday. Victory at the Quicken Loans National was Rose’s sixth triumph since 2010 on the hardest tour of all. The only man who has won more tournaments in America during that time frame is Tiger. Also, Rose has now pulled up alongside Sir Nick for the most titles claimed on US soil by an Englishman since 1945. Now it’s back to the UK for the Scottish Open at Royal Aberdeen next week, followed by the Open Championship on home turf at Royal Liverpool. Rose raises his arms after winning the 18th-hole play-off at the Congressional Country Club . Not for the first time, Rose will step on to the first tee at an Open with a rising sense of expectation. It was like this last year, following his major breakthrough the previous month at the United States Open. It was the same in 2010, when he arrived at St Andrews having achieved two victories in the space of a month. Golfers, generally, don’t react well when the spotlight is shining and there are a million distractions to cope with, and Rose duly missed the cut on both occasions. Indeed, his best performance by a country mile in an Open remains that unforgettable fourth-place finish he managed as a 17-year-old amateur at Royal Birkdale in 1998. If truth be told, that prodigious effort has hung like a millstone around his neck, a constant reminder that this was the tournament it was his destiny to win. Now, practically half of his lifetime later and a few miles south along the same patch of glorious golfing coastline, there’s every reason to believe the hype will be matched with deed and Rose, 34 at the end of this month, can finally contend down the stretch once more. Rose has now won six tournaments on the US Tour since 2010 . On Sunday he showed his most overlooked quality which is just how deep he can dig. A tournament he had dominated towards the close of the final afternoon was in danger of running away from him when his bad shot, a hook from the tee, made an unwelcome appearance under pressure. It says much about a man when the two longest putts he holes all day come in the most stressful of circumstances. One at the 17th rescued a par while the 18-footer for a bogey at the 18th, holed amid the brain-scrambling consequences of a foolish approach that looked to have cost him the title, must be among the best he has made. The subsequent play-off against the game American Shawn Stefani saw a recent major winner against a man who has never won on tour — and it showed. Rose played his best golf when the conditions became firm and fast over the weekend and that’s certainly how it looks like Hoylake will be playing. The last time it was staged there, in 2006, he was watching on television. It was during one of those slumps that have punctuated his rollercoaster career and given him the inner strength we saw again on Sunday. Tied 14th at The Masters and tied 12th at the US Open, Rose offers real cause for the home nation at the British Open to believe. ‘I’m very excited about getting back to Hoylake. I’m excited to play that course. I don’t know how it’s changed since we played it in 2006. It has been a bone dry winter in England.’ Ok, so the terrible winter floods were not big news in the Tiger Woods household. But we certainly welcome the rest of this comment from the 14-time major winner, don’t we? Against the odds it really looks like the main man will be at Royal Liverpool in a fortnight. And yes… we’re excited too, Tiger. Comeback: Tiger Woods hits out of the rough during the second round of the Quicken Loans National . Journeyman Owen a winner at last . Away from the glitz and glamour of the PGA Tour came welcome news from the subsidiary circuit, the Web.com tour, where 42-year-old Englishman Greg Owen was making his 249th start in America since leaving these shores and going west in 2006. He has mustered a clutch of top 10s, including three runner-up finishes — most notably in the 2006 Arnold Palmer Invitational, where he heartbreakingly three-putted from five feet at the 17th. He carved out a nice living for himself and his family, with around £4.5million in earnings. The thing that was always missing was a victory. But Owen broke his duck at the United Leasing Championship, going eagle-birdie-birdie from the 15th to win by one. It was his first win anywhere since the British Masters in 2003, and gives him every chance of reclaiming full privileges for the main circuit next year. The £65,000 first prize was a fraction of that won by Rose, but the elation Owen felt was surely the same.","Justin Rose won the Quicken Loans National in a play-off .

"A simple saliva test was yesterday hailed as the holy grail in the early detection of deadly diseases such as cancer. It could also apply to dementia, Alzheimer’s, type 2 diabetes and auto-immune diseases, the researchers said. The study, the most comprehensive analysis ever conducted of a particular type of molecules in human saliva, reveals that saliva contains many of the same disease-revealing molecules that are in blood. A simple saliva test could be the best new way to test for early signs of cancer and other diseases, researchers have claimed (file image) Dentists may soon be able to take saliva samples to analyse for disease. The report’s lead author Dr David Wong, a dental expert at the University of California in Los Angeles, said the research could lead to self-diagnostic devices.

"Middlesbrough and Bournemouth’s top-of-the-table clash proved a damp squib as they played out a 0-0 draw in the Sky Bet Championship on Saturday. A season-best crowd of 22,930 turned out at the Riverside for the day’s most eye-catching second-tier contest. Yet those in attendance will have left wondering what might have been as both teams’ defences had the decisive say. Yann Kermorgant of Bournemouth is tackled by Adam Clayton during Saturday's drab draw at the Riverside . Kermorgant battles for the ball with  Yanic Wildschut in a game where neither side failed to create too much . Middlesbrough: Konstantopoulos, Fredericks, Ayala, Gibson, Friend, Leadbitter, Clayton, Wildschut (Garcia 46),Tomlin (Vossen 80), Reach, Bamford (Adomah 68). Subs Not Used: Whitehead, Nsue, Veljkovic, Mejias. Booked: Clayton,Gibson. Bournemouth: Boruc, Francis, Elphick, Cook, Daniels, Ritchie (Fraser 74),Arter, Surman, Pugh, Kermorgant (Pitman 74), Wilson. Subs Not Used: Camp, Gosling, Rantie, Harte, Smith. Booked: Francis, Arter, Fraser. Att: 22,930 . Ref: Simon Hooper (Wiltshire). Anticipation was high for the meeting of first versus second, although each side dropped a place ahead of kick-off after Derby rose to the summit with a 5-0 win over Wolves in the early game. Goals were not forthcoming in an entertaining opening period, with the best effort coming when Adam Reach rattled the crossbar. A game that had promised so much petered out during a drab second half to ensure Bournemouth ended the day second, a place ahead of their opponents on goal difference. The teams looked evenly matched during a calm opening period, with both probing cautiously. It was Boro who created the first opening when Lee Tomlin cleverly jinked his way past two defenders, only to see a tame left-footed effort saved by Artur Boruc. Bournemouth responded impressively, with Matt Ritchie forcing Dimi Konstantopoulos to save a clever bicycle kick. More than 20,000 fans turned out to watch Boro's 0-0 draw with Championship rivals Bournemouth . The game was suddenly taking on an end-to-end nature, illustrated by Reach’s fizzing 25-yarder striking the woodwork. Tomlin continued to look the biggest threat and, having been afforded too much space once more, drove to the edge of the box before seeing a low effort turned around the post by Boruc. Middlesbrough endured a couple of scares thereafter, Konstantopoulos producing a stunning fingertip save to turn over Ritchie’s effort before Charlie Daniels’ effort deflected narrowly over the crossbar. Bournemouth ended the half in the ascendancy and almost went in ahead, Harry Arter’s stunning volley flying inches over the bar. The break appeared to sap the energy from the encounter as both sides struggled for fluency early in the second half. But Bournemouth still spurned a golden opportunity when Callum Wilson volleyed over on the stretch after the ball had deflected into his path. That was one of the few sparks, however, as the game settled into a grim rhythm. The visitors were looking the likelier team to end the stalemate, with Marc Pugh’s fizzing ball across the six-yard box just evading Wilson. Unsurprisingly, Middlesbrough pressed on the accelerator as the half wore on - although Bournemouth’s back four were proving a tough nut to crack. They did not really threaten to penetrate it, either, with a Reach effort from distance that flew over their only real strike at goal in the closing stages.","A season-best crowd of 22,930 at the Riverside watch dreary draw .

"Ahead of this weekend's quarter-finals, Sportsmail's experts in Brazil run the rule over the eight remaining teams at the World Cup... FRANCE . Strengths: There is a balance that somehow works. Not the best side on paper but sum of their parts may be greater than the rest. Weaknesses: Patrice Evra is often exposed; Blaise Matuidi and Paul Pogba are red cards waiting to happen; and Olivier Giroud has struggled. Can they win it? Probably not. Could beat Germany, but could struggle if they face Brazil in the semi-finals. Key man: Yohan Cabaye. If he imposes himself on the game, the rest falls into shape. Engine room: Former Newcastle midfielder Yohan Cabaye (left) and Paul Pogba . GERMANY . Strengths: They have the world’s best keeper in Manuel Neuer. In midfield they have unlimited attacking options. Weaknesses: The indulgence of captain Philipp Lahm in the centre. He should be playing full back. Defence is vulnerable and they will be beaten by the best teams. Can they win it? No, they will come up short. Key man: Toni Kroos. More passes than any other player so far at the World Cup. He is the heartbeat of the team. Pass master: Bayern Munich and Germany midfielder general Toni Kroos (right) BRAZIL . Strengths: Neymar, especially now he is fit for Friday night’s game. Wide man Hulk is improving and David Luiz and Thiago Silva can look solid. Weaknesses: Over-reliant on Neymar; Fred as a target man; Oscar not imposing himself; the nerves that may overwhelm them — it’s a long list. Can they win it? Yes, but only because there is a determination not to fail. Key man: Neymar. When he plays, they function; when he’s denied space, they falter. Main man: Barcelona's Neymar has been by far Brazil's best player at the World Cup so far . VIDEO Team Profile: Brazil . COLOMBIA . Strengths: Incisive passing, speed down the flanks, clinical finishing. Coach Jose Pekerman has worked out a system to mitigate the absence of Radamel Falcao. Weaknesses: Mario Yepes has been imperious but at some point the 38-year-old defender will be exposed. The back four is yet to be tested. Can they win it? The heart says yes, the head says Brazil will end the fairytale. Key man: The star of the World Cup, James — that’s Hamez — Rodriguez. Perfect 10: Monaco man Rodriguez has been a revealtion at the World Cup for Colombia . ARGENTINA . Strengths: Same as they ever were: Lionel Messi and that array of attacking options. That said, in reality the difference between them and the others all boils down to one man. Weaknesses: Defensively they are a shambles at times. A really good side, who can dominate possession against them, will expose that. Can they win it? Yes. They are finding a way to win despite their problems. Key man: Everything starts and finishes with Messi. Weight of expectation: Messi is the man Argentina hope will deliver them the World Cup . BELGIUM . Strengths: Rarely concede and boast lots of match-winners. Have the capacity to get much better. Weaknesses: Players like Kevin de Bruyne, Eden Hazard and Kevin Mirallas are all gifted, but sometimes play like they’ve never met each other before. Can they win it? Perhaps, if they can build on what they have and keep their defensive line strong. Key man: Vincent Kompany. They aren’t the same team without their composed captain. Rock solid: Manchester City and Belgium captain Kompany (left) is at the heart of his country's defence . HOLLAND . Strengths: They have match-winners and a smart coach who has convinced them they’re better than they are. Players like Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder can turn games. Weaknesses: They lack quality throughout the team. Their defence isn’t good enough to get the job done at this level. Can they win it? We may have seen the best of them already. Could struggle against a top side. Key man: Robben. Has gifts that most players can only dream of. Speed merchant: Holland winger Arjen Robben (left) has enjoyed a flying start to the World Cup . VIDEO Team Profile: Netherlands . COSTA RICA . Strengths: Hungry and energetic with terrific spirit. Joel Campbell’s pace and Bryan Ruiz’s craft build on a strong defensive base. Weaknesses: The element of surprise is wearing a little thin. Oscar Duarte will miss the quarter-final through suspension and they are not deadly in front of goal. Can they win it? It would be a fabulous story but — no. Key man: Keylor Navas. The keeper has been inspirational. He is an athletic shot-stopper who commands his area.

"Forget what the scoreboard says - Wednesday was a good day for England. The Trent Bridge pitch was one of the most lifeless I’ve seen in this country for some time, but I thought England improved in all the areas that could have been asked of them. They caught well, especially the blinder held by Ian Bell at silly mid-on to see off Cheteshwar Pujara. Their over rate was excellent. Right direction: Alastair Cook and Peter Moores' should be pleased with what England delivered on day one . Classic catch: Joe Root races to congratulate Ian Bell's take to dismiss Cheteshwar Pujara . Spectacular: Bell takes the ball in his fingertips at full stretch at silly mid-on . Matt Prior, who had a question mark over his glovework at Headingley, was superb. Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad kept going on a lifeless pitch. And, perhaps most encouragingly of all, Alastair Cook had a very good day with his tactics. He was especially good after the two breaks: Pujara and Virat Kohli fell shortly after lunch, with Cook setting a silly mid-on for Pujara, while Ajinkya Rahane departed just after tea. He realised the ball was reversing and set tight fields. And he did well to get a silly point into Rahane. I know that the catch he took was a little fortuitous, but a couple of balls earlier one had landed just short of him in the same position. Cook knew what he was doing. I also thought he rotated the bowlers well. Given the conditions, there were a lot of good things happening. VIDEO Vijay puts India in control . Superb: Matt Prior put in an excellent shift on day one after a questionable performance against Sri Lanka . Charging in: Stuart Broad and his fast bowling brothers kept charging in on a pitch that gave nothing back . I also liked the way Prior was urging his slip cordon to get up closer to the stumps because of the slowness of the surface. My only criticism was that Cook could have set a third man earlier than he did. On a pitch like this, Indian batsmen don’t need a second invitation to open the face of their bats. And if you’re only having one slip, you risk leaking a lot of runs. In terms of the pitch itself, I’m not one to try to overdo home advantage. If the pitch had been covered with grass, for example, then it would have brought India’s seamers into the game too. But a Test pitch has got to have some carry in it. Without carry, you risk losing the spectacle. The ball goes through at shin height, and a ring field can make run-scoring difficult. Positive atmopshere: Cook (second left) shares a laugh with his team-mates after Punjara's dismissal . Massive wicket: The wicket of Virat Kohli by Stuart Broad was largely thanks to Cook's critiqued captaincy . Trent Bridge has often been flat. I remember David Gower’s side failing to take a wicket all day here in a Test against Australia in 1989. But even that had a bit of bounce and carry in it. Thankfully, England managed to get the ball to reverse yesterday. But if Test cricket is going to survive and flourish, we need surfaces with something in them for everyone. As for Murali Vijay, he just reminds me of every other young Indian batsman I see these days. They all just know how to bat. You don’t look at them and spot an obvious technical weakness, and they just make batting look so easy. He left very well as his innings developed, and this success - in his first Test innings in England - will give him a lot of confidence as the series progresses. And if this pitch starts to show signs of uneven bounce as the game goes on, it could prove a mighty valuable knock.","England toiled in the field to have India 259 for 4 at stumps on day one .

"Dundee United chairman Stephen Thompson last night hailed Ryan Gauld's stunning move to Sporting Lisbon - in a deal that could eventually net the Tannadice club £12million. Thompson helped pull off the £3m deal that has seen his teenage midfielder swap Tayside for the Portuguese capital on a six-year deal. Such is Sporting's faith in the 18-year-old Scot, they insisted on inserting a clause in Gauld's contract stating that interested parties must fork out a staggering £48m to land the Scotland Under-21 player in future. New: Sporting Lisbon and Dundee United reached an agreement over the player Ryan Gauld . Costly: Gauld has an incredible £48million release clause in his Sporting Lisbon contract . Promise: Sporting Lisbon signed talented teenager Gauld from Dundee United on a six-year contract . VIDEO Gauld inspiring Dundee United assisting all four goals . And Sportsmail believes that should Gauld one day meet that valuation, United would be in line to quadruple their initial £3m windfall from the Champions League outfit thanks to their own insertion of a sell-on percentage and add-ons amid what is  understood to be a complex deal. Tannadice chairman Thompson said the move should encourage United's other coveted kids to aim for the very top - on the day the club rejected bids in excess of £1m from West Ham United for highly-rated Scotland left-back Andrew Robertson. 'It's never easy to let one of your best players go but it was a fantastic deal for the club and a fantastic opportunity for Ryan,' said Thompson. 'Let's just say we are happy with the contract and that if he moves on  further down the line then we will get benefits from that as well. 'I think this deal puts United on the map. 'How many times do you see a young home-grown  Scottish player get a transfer like this? Not very often. 'It's big news over in Portugal and in England. Alike? Gauld has been nicknamed 'Mini Messi' due to similarities in playing style . Next in line? Gauld will hope to follow in the footsteps of Cristiano Ronaldo at Sporting Lisbon . 'In terms of marketing ourselves as a place where talent is developed and then sold on, this deal is very good for the club. 'It is also very good for the other young players here. They couldn't get any better encouragement. 'If Ryan can do it, they'll want to.' Thompson, who refused to speak about West Ham's interest in  Robertson, maintains the deal to sell Gauld was simply too good for the club to turn down. And he warned other sides watching Robertson, John Souttar, Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven, that his gifted kids won't be allowed to leave on the cheap. Thompson said: 'A lot of work has been put in to developing the likes of Ryan and getting him and others on long-term contracts so we can get a decent transfer fee like this one. It's about the business side of things as much as the  football side.' Gauld's money-spinning transfer will slightly strengthen boss Jackie McNamara's arm when it comes to bringing more new faces to the club this summer. Thompson said: 'The Gauld money doesn't change Jackie's budget dramatically. 'We were backing him in the transfer market before, and we'll still be backing him.'","Ryan Gauld moved to Sporting Lisbon on a six-year contract .

"A British Airways flight was forced to veer off course to avoid a Spanish military aircraft as it prepared to land at Gibraltar’s airport last week, authorities have confirmed. Gibraltar’s government said the Lockheed P-3 Orion anti-submarine and maritime surveillance aircraft was flying ahead of the BA plane through the Straits when it ‘suddenly reversed its direction and took another course’ on Friday afternoon. The incident sparked safety and political concerns as air traffic controllers issued an emergency order for the BA flight, which was 10 to 15 miles from landing, to immediately change direction to maintain a safe distance. Scroll down for video . A BA plane was ordered to change its course after a Spanish military plane suddenly reversed its direction . A statement from the government said the Spanish Air Force plane’s manoeuvre ‘would have infringed safety parameters had the BA flight not moved under instructions from Gibraltar ATC.’ The incident occurred while the BA Airbus A320 was flying from London Heathrow Airport to the tiny contested British outpost on the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula. In a statement, British Airways said: 'Our flight crew followed air traffic control instructions, as they normally would, and the flight landed without incident.' Gibraltar’s government said it understands that the Spanish aircraft contacted local air traffic controllers and clarified its intentions after which the BA flight was given clearance to land, the Gibraltar Chronicle reported. Gibraltar’s government is investigating whether the military aircraft entered the airspace over the British Gibraltar Territorial Waters disputed by Spain. A P-3C Orion aircraft similar to the jet that veered the BA plane off course (file photo) The BA plane was 10 to 15 miles from landing when the incident occurred last Friday afternoon . An FCO spokesperson told MailOnline Travel: ‘We are aware of the incident on 31st October involving a British Airways commercial flight bound for Gibraltar. ‘The aircraft was asked to divert from its original routing because of the activity of a Spanish military aircraft in the area. ‘Air traffic control were in contact with both aircraft and the British Airways plane diverted in accordance with standard ATC procedures. There was at no time any risk to safety.’ The FCO said it was not an unlawful incursion into ‘British Gibraltar airspace’ as the Spanish aircraft remained in Spanish airspace at all times. The incident follows a series of diplomatic rows between the UK and Spain over the British Overseas Territory. In October Britain’s Foreign & Commonwealth Office accused a Spanish state research vessel of carrying out ‘irresponsible’ and ‘dangerous manoeuvring in British Gibraltar Territorial Waters, potentially risking the lives of Royal Navy personnel. Europe minister David Lidington called Spain's secretary of state for foreign affairs Gonzalo de Benito to express 'grave concerns' about October's incident. The Rock of Gibraltar is seen from the tiny British outpost's airport, located on the border with Spain . That incident followed news that Spanish fighter jets flew 'across the bow' of a Monarch Airlines plane as it landed on Gibraltar. Spain ceded Gibraltar to Britain in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, but has said it will never renounce its claim to sovereignty. Gibraltar has accused Spain of harassment and bullying, and the FCO says it has seen a surge in the number of incursions into territorial waters. Last year alone Spanish state vessels made 496 illegal incursions in British Gibraltar Territorial Waters. MailOnline Travel has contacted British Airways for comment.","Military aircraft suddenly 'reversed its direction and took another course'

By half-time, most people in this particular establishment had gone back to their food and their free bar. Outside under an awning a couple of musicians had begun to warm up. The warning signs had been there from the start, of course. The first goal of this tournament was an own goal, scored by a Brazilian. That day here in Sao Paulo, the home team needed a leg up from a referee to get by against Croatia. The problem with momentum and emotion, though, is that it clouds issues. Realities of life and sport get forgotten and that’s a good thing. It allows you to feel and think things that really aren’t logical. And that is how it has been here. How the media reacted: Meia Hora's front page says 'Will Not Cover', . seeking to ignore any mention of the embarrassment (and says how another . goal was scored by Germany while they were editing it), while Lance list . a few words of feeling; Pain, Indignation and Revolt and Shame amongst . them . Overreaction: Brazil were looking backwards at Neymar's injury, not forwards to the game . I saw Brazil play their second group games against Mexico – a goalless draw – and Cameroon – a 4-1 win – and it was clear on both occasions that this was a Brazilian team carrying deeper flaws than perhaps any in the nation’s history. Even in beating Cameroon – just about the weakest team in the competition – Brazil looked uncomfortable. Across the back, they were awful. And that was with Thiago Silva – suspended for the Germany clash – in the team. Rescued by Neymar on that occasion, I suggested in my match report that Brazil would run in to a hiding before long. The only surprise is that it took so long and that – when it came – it was so big. Reaction: Jornal de Noticias blame 'The German Complex' for the defeat, while Agora describe how a 'Dream Turned Into a Nightmare' at the Estadio Mineirao on Tuesday evening . Humiliated: Brazil striker Fred looks dejected as his side struggled to make an impression going forwards . Head in hands: Brazil fans will be waking up to embarrassment on Wednesday morning . Hope: Brazil fans were convinced they could go all the way, despite being apprehensive before the tournament . Harsh: O Dia tells Scolari to 'Go to Hell', as Extra says 'Congratulations' to the 1950 Brazil side who lost in the final of the World Cup at the Maracana to Uruguay, the nation's worst sporting night... before Tuesday night . Certainly, Brazil provided us with a story we were happy to buy and the country with something to cling to. You only had to look down the squad list, though, to see where the problems lay. Fred, Hulk, Jo, Maicon. These are players that would not get many games between them in the Barclays Premier League. Some have tried, and failed. This, remember, was a World Cup. Heaven knows what players like Liverpool’s Philippe Coutinho and Manchester United’s Rafael da Silva have done to upset Scolari but certainly they should have been in his 23, if not necessarily his starting XI. Devastated: Brazilian newspapers stick the boot . in to their fallen stars, with Correio calling the defeat an .

VIDEO Disbelief in Belo Horizonte after devastating Germany win . Alternatives: Philippe Coutinho and Rafael were both overlooked for Scolari's 23-man squad . Perhaps Scolari knew what was coming after the scrappy penalty shootout victory over Chile. 'Shame, Grievance, Humiliation': O Globo's take on the disaster on the pitch in Belo Horizonte . The Chileans hit the crossbar in extra time that day and maybe the coach sensed then – if he hadn’t before – that his squad wasn’t good enough. Certainly the manner in which they subsequently hacked Colombia off the field in the last eight – and the faux commiserations that followed from the likes of David Luiz – were depressing. The nation, however, was almost delirious by then. Such was the hysteria about Neymar’s injury that the build up to Tuesday’s game was spent with millions of people looking backwards, rather than forwards. Perhaps Scolari and his players did, too. Against Germany they certainly played . as though they hadn’t prepared. Even Neymar, Pele, Zico and Socrates . between them wouldn’t have stopped this happening. Those . in yellow looked bereft with only half an hour gone and a nation felt . their pain. None of these players earn a living in Brazil. As such, it . will be a while before their public get to see them in a match that . matters again. Maybe that is . part of the problem. Maybe there are too many young Brazilians hidden . in talent factories in Russia and the Ukraine now for their love for the . yellow shirt to stay strong.

Devastated: David Luiz is comforted by fellow defender Thiago Silva who was suspended for the clash . Who's at fault? Brazil lost 7-1 in their own back yard, breaking a few unwanted records along the way . What happened in Belo Horizonte, though, wasn’t above love or passion or desire. If there was ever a case of a team wanting something too much, then perhaps this was it. Whatever the case, a dream is over and the humdrum beckons once again here. In my bar in Sao Paulo, the barman had only one thing left to wish for. 'Come on Holland,' he said. VIDEO Delight in Munich for Germany fans .

Just when it appeared Ivory Coast had something to smile about, their dreams of World Cup progress were dramatically shattered by Greece.

Greece’s joy was in sharp contrast to Ivory Coast’s anguish. This game was played out with the death of Yaya and Kolo Toure’s brother Ibrahim still fresh in the mind and their country has been hit by severe flooding in recent weeks.

"The Afghan villager who rescued a Navy SEAL and became the inspiration for the Hollywood film Lone Survivor is now on the run from the Taliban. Mohammad Gulab, 40, was hailed as a hero by Mark Wahlberg when he came over to California to meet the family of Marcus Luttrell, the man he saved. But less than a year after his story hit theaters - taking $125 million at the box office - the father has never felt so afraid. 'My life is in worse danger than ever,' he told Vocativ. Scroll down for video . Fear: Mohammad Gulab, 40, was the inspiration for a 2013 Hollywood film but now fears for his life . He has been splitting his time between his family home in the mountains of Kunar, northeastern Afghanistan, and a secret hideout for months to stop Taliban bombers targeting his wife, daughters and sons. He only spends a few hours a day with his family before retreating to the undisclosed location. In April, someone threw a makeshift bomb at his feet, missing by just a few steps. Days later, a gang of men descended on his house in the middle of the night while he was out, banging on the door pretending to be neighbors. Incredible story: He hid Marcus Luttrell from the Shah after the Navy SEAL was left stranded in Afghan hilltops . Lone survivor: Luttrell turned his experience of the struggle to escape into a best-selling novel in 2007 . Movie material: Here Mark Walhberg (left) plays Luttrell and Ali Suliman (center) plays Gulab in the 2013 movie . Eventually, after the family refused to unlock the door, they threw a bomb at the property. Gulab waited until daylight to take his injured daughter to hospital. In June, a sniper fired a bullet at Gulab's head. It missed him by inches and instead wounded his cousin walking beside him. He revealed to Vocativ that he had been planning to move to the US and hoped that Marcus Luttrell could secure him a green card, but Luttrell's family insist that was a misunderstanding. His story was turned into a film after Marcus Luttrell penned the 2007 book Lone Survivor. True story: This is a picture of Luttrell with a team of Navy SEALs. He is still in touch with his rescuer Gulab . Hit: Lone Survivor made $125 million at the box office and Gulab flew to America to attend the premiere . It described how he saw three of his friends die in an ambush on an Afghan mountain when their squad was ambushed by up to 50 fighters, armed with mortars, machined guns, rocket-propelled grenades and AK-47s. When the SEALS scrambled a rapid reaction force to rescue their stranded comrades, the militants opened fire and managed to shoot down one of the helicopters carrying rescuers. It crashed, killing eight SEALS and eight Marine pilots. Days later, he was discovered by Gulab who hid him from Shah, the group of fighters trying to track him down.","Mohammad Gulab, 40, hid Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell from the Shah .

"The final passenger plane has flown out of Blackpool airport, bringing to an end its illustrious 105-year history. Staff wept as the last flight departed for the Isle of Man at 5pm, with the Lancashire airport preparing to officially shut its doors for the final time at 6pm, leaving 118 people out of work. The airport, which was formerly known as Squires Gate Airfield, became one of the first UK aviation sites in the UK after opening in 1909, but has suffered from financial problems in recent years. Scroll down for video . Staff wept as the last flight departed for the Isle of Man before the airport prepares to close its doors . The last passengers boarded the 5pm flight to the Isle of Man, with the airport set to close one hour later . Check-in staff were in tears and were seen consoling one another as they waved the final few passengers through the departure gates this evening. Balfour Beatty, who bought the site in 2008, put the airport in Lancashire up for sale in August following years of financial struggles, which saw them losing around £2m a year. However, despite being one of the UK's smallest airports, Blackpool International airport  has a huge history. The Lancashire airstrip has played host to a string of celebrity guests over the years. It was 1909 that more than 200,000 spectators gathered to watch legendary airman Frenchman Henri Farman take to the air to perform in an air show on the site at Squires Gate on the Fylde coast. Check-in staff were in tears and were seen consoling one another as they prepared to leave the airport . Blackpool airport, which is being closed this afternoon at 6pm following years of financial struggles, dates back more than a century and has played host to a string of celebrity guests since it was first opened in 1909 . In 1927 it was finally opened to the paying public, offering flights to and from the Isle of Man. It later began short haul holiday flights to countries such as Spain and the former Yugoslavia and by 1950 had become a vital transport link, with 25,000 passengers passing through the airport to travel to Manchester, London, Leeds, Birmingham, Southport and Glasgow. According to Stuart Menzies, who has worked at the airport for 28 years and who manages a fleet of aircraft from the site, the airport has been popular with royalty as well as VIPs. He told ITV: ‘It is a small airport and they can arrive without encountering the paparazzi. ‘Very early on I remember the Sultan of Brunei came through on his way to the Lake District.

In the 1983 General Election campaign, Tory Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher used the airport to arrive in nearby Fleetwood for one of her final election rallies. Pilot Brian Bateson, a flying instructor based at the airport, famously bought a Vulcan bomber in 1983 which he placed at the entrance to the airport. It was finally sold on eBay in 2004.

"They are the brilliant young, French pair with growing reputations and destined for big-money transfers. So how did Paul Pogba and Raphael Varane, both 21, fare in the World Cup quarter final against Germany? The problem with being a graceful, stylish, youthful central defender, is that a bigger, brutish heavyweight can always come along and flatten you. Rio Ferdinand used to have the same problem. Playing for West Ham against Everton one Saturday afternoon, he tried to nutmeg Duncan Ferguson… and suffered the consequence. It was a painful lesson. VIDEO Scroll dwon to watch the skillfull Paul Pogba show off his freestyle ability . Bullied: Varane is pushed away from the ball as Mats Hummels heads Germany in front . Decisive: Hummels' header in the Maracana was enough to knock France out of the World Cup . Learning: Varane has plenty of technical ability but up against a bigger defender he struggled . Despair: The French centre-half watches as the German's header sails over his goalkeeper and in off the bar . Triumph: Hummels celebrates beating Varane to score the game's only goal and put Germany through . Harry .

Maybe that’s why Harry had so much success developing young . players: you can’t kill them every time they cock it up. One . hopes Raphael Varane, the wonderful Real Madrid player, will get as . much sympathy in France after Germany scored the only goal of this . knock-out tie. A . hanging free kick from Bastien Schweinsteiger looped into the French . box and Varane rose, a little off balance, but the favourite to clear . his lines. However, . quite simply, he was bullied out of it by Mats Hummels, his German . counterpart. The ball should have been heading for the fringes of the . box, but the German got a run on Varane, who was all gangling arms and . legs. With one powerful, booming header, France were heading out of the World Cup. Up again: Varane's biggest threat came from his opposing defenders at German set pieces . Shackled: Varane prevented World Cup specialist Miroslav Klose from scoring, but the damage was done . Perhaps . it was a routine the Germans had worked on in training. After all, . Varane weighs just under 12 stone, while Hummels has two stone on him. In WBA boxing terms, one is a super-middleweight, the other is a cruiserweight. And this was a knock-out moment. If Varane is to, one day, play in the Barclays Premier League, he will have to learn to deal with that. Not that Real Madrid are in any hurry to sell him and why should he want to scarper from Spain? The . goal was a victory for those who like their centre halves big and . meaty, the sort of warrior kick-and-crush brigade championed by World . Cup winner Jack Charlton, who once said that ‘if centre halves could . play they would be bloody midfielders’. Franz . Beckenbauer, Bobby Moore and quite a few others would contest that.

"Can Liverpool's new boys fill the void left by Luis Suarez? Liverpool are on the verge of completing a £30million double swoop for Belgium World Cup star Divock Origi and Benfica winger Lazar Markovic. Origi was pictured arriving in Liverpool on Wednesday to discuss terms with Reds officials at their Melwood training ground and could undergo his medical alongside Markovic on Thursday. A £19.8million fee for Markovic is believed to have been agreed with Benfica - which activated his release clause - while Origi looks sets to cost Liverpool £10m from French outfit Lille, although Tottenham are attempted to snatch the Belgian striker for themselves. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Divock Origi in action during Belgium training . Anfield bound? Origi (right) has flew into Liverpool earlier this month to discuss a possible move to the club . Arriving: Origi (pictured with orange sleeves) was taken into Liverpool's Melwood training ground . Not done yet: Although Origi arrived on Merseyside a deal has not yet been finalised . Wanted man: Tottenham are also interested in the striker and could look to scupper the deal . Target: Atletico Madrid have joined the race to sign Liverpool target, Belgium striker Divock Origi . Done deal: Liverpool met the £20million release clause in Lazar Markovic's Benfica contract . Manager Brendan Rodgers is keen to spend the £75m he will recuperate from the sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona and he is nearing adding Markovic to his squad. The Anfield club have been in discussions with Benfica for weeks over a deal for their 20-year-old winger. Markovic has played 12 times for Serbia, scoring twice, and he netted seven goals in 49 appearances for Benfica last season. Origi meanwhile impressed at the World Cup, scoring for Belgium against Russia during the group stages after replacing Chelsea forward Romelu Lukaku in the starting line-up.

"He will be remembered for ever but that is no compliment. The 2014 World Cup will be associated with Luis Suarez in the same way Spain 1982 is synonymous with Harald Schumacher. I hardly saw the West Germany goalkeeper play but mention his name and I know immediately he was responsible for the outrageous collision in the semi-final that left France midfielder Patrick Battiston unconscious. It was one of the most shocking incidents in World Cup history but, unfortunately, Suarez has put himself in that bracket after biting Giorgio Chiellini. Rather than being regarded as one of the finest forwards in the game, he’s now simply known as the one who bites people. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Luis Suarez claim he simply collided with Chiellini's shoulder . Flashpoint: The 2014 World Cup will be remembered for this Luis Suarez bite on Giorgio Chiellini . Worried: Suarez seemed sheepish as he walked through Uruguay's team hotel in Natal, Brazil . I still find the incident in Natal completely bizarre. I worked with Luis every day for two-and-a-half years at Liverpool and if you spent time in his company at Melwood, you would struggle to believe he was capable of such ridiculous moments. He’s a quiet lad, in the main. He’s not someone who squares up to people on the training ground if things don’t go his way and he’s not overly-aggressive or a bully. Yes, his desire to win is fierce but that is no different from a lot of top professionals. As for him needing a ‘mental edge’ to operate at the highest level, that’s nonsense. He is a special footballer because he scores incredible goals, his skill, tremendous physical capabilities and enthusiasm. He pushes himself to the limit but that doesn’t mean we should have to accept moments of madness. Star: Suarez has deservedly picked up a host of personal awards while at Liverpool . Shocking: Chiellini shows his wounds to the referee during Uruguay's win against Italy . Playing the victim: The 27-year-old held his teeth in pain after the incident against Italy on Tuesday . Evidence: Chiellini seemed to have a red bite mark on his left shoulder after the incident . Luis will be distraught today. When he bit Branislav Ivanovic during a 2-2 draw with Chelsea in April 2013, in the days and weeks that followed you could see how much of an impact it had made on him. He was devastated, as was his wife, Sofia. Do not think, however, I am looking to defend him. I didn’t when he tangled with Ivanovic and I’m not changing my view. Luis’s actions have been disgraceful and it defies belief that he could behave as if he was in a playground once again after everything Liverpool have done for him. The signs last season had been encouraging. He was booked only six times (compared to 11 times in 2012-13) and benefited from a philosophy Brendan Rodgers calls ‘match management’. He wants players to remain calm and focused at all times. Dr Steve Peters goes to every Liverpool game for a variety of reasons but part of it is to analyse ‘impulse management’ and he will study how players react in pressure situations. The system worked last year because Liverpool topped the fair play league. Horrifying: Harald Schumacher of West Germany (right) jumps past the ball as he gets ready to collide with French defender Patrick Battiston (left) during the 1982 World Cup semi-final . Wrong: Schumacher's collision with Battiston is one of the most shocking incident in World Cup history . But away from that environment, he has lost focus and if I’m honest, I don’t believe he will change. He will always have that tendency to self-destruct. This latest incident mirrored the ones with Ivanovic and PSV Eindhoven’s Otman Bakkal — it was a split-second reaction, instinctive. Could there be an element he felt he would get away with it? Think about it: why would you choose to bite someone? When the red mist descends on a footballer, you may expect a punch to be thrown, an elbow to be swung or even a headbutt but if you bite someone, it is virtually impossible to be detected by match officials. No referee will ever see you if you get in close enough and TV pictures may prove inconclusive. Had these incidents taken place 20 years ago, when there were not so many TV cameras in stadiums, Luis might never have been punished. After all, none of the referees in the games in which he bit Bakkal, Ivanovic and Chiellini sent him off, as neither they nor their assistants saw the crime take place. Guilty? The Uruguay talisman seemed to have something on his mind after the final whistle . Shame: Suarez would have been remembered for his stunning performance against England . Stunning: The forward scored twice to help Uruguay defeat England in the Group D clash . But he has been caught and now some questions need to be answered on what the consequences will be for Liverpool, who have done everything they can to help him psychologically by making Dr Peters available to him at all times. The biggest previous punishment handed out by FIFA, of course, was the eight-game ban imposed on Mauro Tassotti when he broke Luis Enrique’s nose with an elbow at the USA World Cup in 1994 — I maintain a footballer would rather be bitten than have his nose smashed or be left unconscious, like Battiston. I have thought about it and believe the biggest way to hurt him would have been for FIFA to suspend him for the rest of the World Cup and then ban him for a calendar year, which would rule him out of Uruguay’s Copa America defence in Chile next summer. People are calling for a worldwide ban but I don’t think Liverpool should be punished. Uruguay didn’t suffer when he served the Ivanovic ban, did they? He missed the first five Barclays Premier League games, during which time Liverpool dropped five points against Swansea and Southampton. The form Luis was in last year, I’m certain he would have made the difference in those matches and Liverpool would have then won the title. Down: Chiellini clutches his shoulder after clashing with Suarez during the Group D match . Trouble ahead: Luis Suarez (left) is the subject of disciplinary proceedings by FIFA . Rematch: Suarez has had his eyes on Chiellini for quite some time ¿ the pair met in last year¿s Confederations Cup . With Liverpool, his situation is even more complicated. Those who are saying the club should make a stand and drum him out have no grasp on reality because no business would get shot of an £80million asset for nothing or a reduced fee. Luis is not like Charles Itandje, the Cameroon goalkeeper who was sacked by Liverpool in 2009 after he was caught misbehaving at the Hillsborough Memorial Service. Itandje was no good, had a bad attitude and was never going to play, so getting shot of him was easy to do. You would never say the same about Luis but there comes a point when enough is enough. You have to wonder whether Barcelona and Real Madrid have been put off by what they saw in Natal but there is no doubt his future will become a massive issue. Bad attitude: Charles Itandje was sacked by Liverpool in 2009 after misbehaving at the Hillsborough Memorial Service . Decision: Brendan Rodgers may have to allow Suarez to leave Liverpool after his latest misdemeanor . Now you get the feeling that Liverpool might actually be relieved if Barcelona or Real come in with a bid that triggers a move. If a lucrative offer arrives in the next few weeks, I am convinced Suarez will be playing his football somewhere else next season. He has been a magnificent player and that is why Liverpool supporters have staunchly stood by him but even they believe now that this latest controversy is something the club can do without. And the problem you have with Luis, for all his wonderful gifts, is that this episode is unlikely to be his last.

"A former policeman alleged to have intervened on behalf of Jimmy Savile before he was interviewed over sexual assault claims has been revealed as a member of the shamed DJ's 'Friday Morning Club'. Mick Starkey, 61, was apparently known as Savile's 'bodyguard' and drove the star around in a Rolls-Royce. He is now being investigated over claims he contacted Surrey Police before they interviewed Savile in 2009 and 'acted on behalf' of the DJ. Claims: Former policeman Mick Starkey, left, was apparently close to Jimmy Savile and frequently visited his home . Starkey, who was an inspector with West Yorkshire Police at the time of the alleged incident, has been pictured with Savile grinning next to a luxury car. He has previously been named as a key member of the 'Friday Morning Club', a group of police officers and others who would gather at Savile's flat in Leeds on a weekly basis. This week it emerged that Starkey told Surrey Police that he knew the DJ 'personally' and offered to put Savile in touch with them. Officers interviewed Savile in October 2009 after several young girls came forward claiming they had been abused by the broadcaster. Close: Starkey drove the DJ's silver Rolls-Royce and was apparently known as his 'bodyguard' Investigation: Starkey is at the centre of a probe by the IPCC over claims he acted on Savile's behalf . When the transcript of the interview was made public this week it sparked anger as detectives appeared to adopt a kid-glove approach to the celebrity suspect. Savile boasted of his 'collection' of police contacts in Leeds, and said that he passed on to officers letters from blackmailers claiming to have been assaulted by him. ‘I have up in Yorkshire, where I live in Leeds, a collection of senior police persons who come to see me socially, but I give them all my weirdo letters,’ he said. Starkey, referred to as 'Inspector 5' in official reports, has refused to comment on his links to Savile. In a biography of the star published last year, the officer was quoted as saying: 'I feel privileged to have known the real Jimmy. 'It amuses me when I read reports saying he was a loner with few friends. He was popular.' Shamed: Savile abused hundreds of young girls over a period of decades but never faced justice . Interview: The transcript of Surrey Police's interview with Savile in 2009 was released this week . A spokesman for the Independent Police Complaints Commission said this week: ‘The Commission has begun an independent investigation in relation to the alleged actions of a former inspector with West Yorkshire Police. 'The allegations refer to the officer having “acted on behalf” of Jimmy Savile by inappropriately contacting Surrey Police ahead of a police interview.’ The Radio 1 DJ is thought to have raped 34 women and girls and sexually assaulted up to 450 people, including some as young as eight, according to an official report. He died two years ago, aged 84. Operation Newgreen, a West Yorkshire Police report published this year, found no evidence that Savile was shielded from arrest and protected from prosecution by his relationship with the force. This week an unnamed officer claimed that he caught Savile seducing a 15-year-old girl but was told not to pursue the matter. The policeman has been urged to come forward by investigators.","Mick Starkey, 61, drove Savile's Rolls-Royce and attended the DJ's 'Friday Morning Club'

"A list believed to detail the names of child abuse victims has been found behind a secret wall by police investigating crimes uncovered as a result of the inquiry into disgraced DJ Jimmy Savile. Officers swooped on a flat above a record shop in Greater Manchester following a tip-off and discovered the appalling roll call scrawled behind layers of wallpaper and plaster, it has emerged. The list includes the names and ages of hundreds of boys and girls, next to a disgusting ratings system that apparently related to their sexual performance. Some of the names were reportedly boys and girls the paedophiles were planning to target. Paedophile: Jimmy Savile sexually abused hundreds of young victims from 1955 to 2009 . The discovery, which allegedly dates from the 1980s and 1990s, was made by officers from Greater Manchester Police. They are currently investigating historic sex abuse allegations that came to light following publicity surrounding Operation Yewtree, the inquiry into sex offences committed by Savile. In the era before the internet, paedophiles used secret magazines or groups to share their crimes with fellow sex attackers in the same way some use internet forums now. Criminologists believe that the wall could be an example of such behaviour. ‘It is a boasting system,’ said David Wilson, Professor of Criminology at Birmingham City University. ‘Paedophiles are constantly evolving ways of communicating. It is a form of saying, “This is what I’ve done, I’ve done more than you”. It’s about them displaying their own sexual success in being able to abuse these children.’ Police denied claims that the flat was used by Savile or that the names amounted to a list of his victims. The Leeds-born Top of the Pops host had links with Greater Manchester stretching back to the 1950s, when he managed a ballroom in the city. His first known attack, in 1955, also took place in the city. Detective Chief Superintendent Mary Doyle said: ‘Last year, Greater Manchester Police received allegations about historic sexual abuse that occurred in the Greater Manchester area. These allegations were made as a result of Operation Yewtree, which was the investigation by the Metropolitan Police into Jimmy Savile. Investigation: Greater Manchester Police discovered the names after a tip-off they received 'as a result of Operation Yewtree' ‘It is important to stress these allegations were not about Jimmy Savile himself and GMP is not carrying out any inquiries directly relating to Savile. ‘The recovery of these names came as a result of an ongoing investigation into the allegations made last year’. ‘This is a live, complex investigation for which we have already made arrests therefore I cannot go into great detail about the status of the investigation.’ Savile’s death, aged 84 in October 2011, prompted a wave of allegations against the former BBC presenter. A joint police and NSPCC report, published in January, revealed that Savile was one of Britain’s most prolific paedophiles, with around 450 victims of offences over more than half a century. It said Savile had committed 214 known offences, including 34 rapes, across 28 police force areas.

"Jailed: PCSO Liam Austerfield was sentenced to 15 months today for grooming a 14-year-old schoolgirl online . A police community support officer has been jailed today for grooming a 14-year-old schoolgirl online and begging her to send him explicit pictures. Liam Austerfield, 28, had over 300 exchanges with the child by text and Facebook when police seized his mobile phone, laptop and computer. During one exchange he sent an indecent picture of himself and told her: 'If you want to see more you have to show more'. Today Austerfield was jailed for 15 months at Sheffield Crown Court. He had admitted three counts of making indecent images of children, one count . of possessing 13 indecent images of a child and one count of inciting a . child to engage in sexual activity. The 28-year-old was serving with the North West neighbourhood policing team in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, at the time of the offences. He was suspended from duty while an investigation was carried out, prompted by concerns raised by the girl's parents, and he resigned from West Yorkshire  Police in April. The court heard that communication between Austerfield and the girl 'started on innocent terms but after a short period of time it turned to topics of a sexual nature'. Michael Rawlinson, prosecuting, said: 'He requested naked images of her but the girl didn't send naked images despite his requests. 'She sent pictures of herself in her pyjamas and her bra and knickers instead. 'He knew full well how old this complainant was.' In uniform: The 28-year-old (pictured) committed the crimes while he served in Wakefield but he has been forced to resign in disgrace . Jailing Austerfield, Judge Roger Keen QC said: 'Instead of behaving properly, you abused the trust the community placed in you in order to gain sexual satisfaction. 'You have brought a great deal of distress to your own family but more importantly your actions have had a profound effect on your victim and her  family. 'Your position if further aggravated because of your work at the time. 'You corrupted this girl and as a consequence her life has been greatly affected. 'Your position in the community takes this well outside the appropriate guidelines.' After police seized his mobile phone and laptop following his arrest on March 21, they discovered Austerfield had searched the internet for 'pre-teen taboo'. Mr Rawlinson said Austerfield claimed to be 'heavily intoxicated when the worst of the incidents took place and could recall very little about them'. Describing the victim impact statements written by the girl's parents, Mr Rawlinson said: 'Her mum feels that the incident has destroyed her family due  to the stress of it. 'She has separated from the girl's father following so many arguments and she blames herself for what happened. She feels it has set her daughter back a very great deal.' Alison Dorrell, mitigating, said: 'This is a serious breach of trust. He was well aware from the outset of her age. 'He has lost his good character. He has lost a career he enjoyed and he now has no prospect of ever becoming a police officer. 'He has thrown away all the progress he at 28 had made in his life. His family are dismayed at having to support him through a crown court case. 'He spent two years working in the community and he had been well thought of.'","Liam Austerfield had 300 conversations with child via text and Facebook .

"'Immeasurable harm': Sir Cliff Richard, pictured, has suffered 'irreparable damage to his reputation' as a result of the BBC broadcasting live coverage of a police raid on his home, MPs say today . Sir Cliff Richard has suffered ‘enormous, irreparable damage to his reputation’ as a result of the BBC broadcasting extensive live coverage of a police raid on his home, MPs say today. In a blistering report, the Home Affairs Select Committee attacks the BBC and South Yorkshire Police for their handling of the sexual abuse case. Lawyers for the star have also criticised the ‘premature and disproportionate’ reporting which has caused ‘immeasurable harm’ to the singer, who is still under police investigation. TV reporters were able to film live aerial shots of a raid on Sir Cliff’s home on August 14 after being tipped off in advance. The chief constable of South Yorkshire Police told MPs the BBC had put his force in ‘a very difficult position’ after confronting officers with leaked information about the planned search. David Crompton said his force was convinced the BBC would run a story about the investigation without some kind of deal so felt it had no option but to warn the journalist, Dan Johnson, when it was taking place. In today’s report the MPs say that, when the corporation’s reporter ‘threatened to break the story prematurely unless he was given inside access to the raid on Sir Cliff’s home, South Yorkshire Police should not have tried to cut a deal with him’. Instead, they argue, the force should have approached senior BBC executives to explain the damage that such premature disclosure could do to the investigation. The report concludes: ‘In the absence of any such approach from South Yorkshire, the BBC was well within its rights to run the story, although as a result Sir Cliff himself has suffered enormous, irreparable damage to his reputation.’ Sir Cliff’s £3million apartment was searched by officers from South Yorkshire and Thames Valley Police as part of an investigation into an alleged sexual assault on a young boy at a religious event in 1985. A BBC crew arrived on the scene before the police while Sir Cliff – who vigorously denies any wrongdoing and has not been arrested – was abroad. Committee chairman Keith Vaz said: ‘South Yorkshire Police’s handling of this situation was utterly inept. No British citizen should have to watch their home being raided by the police live on television. 'Sir Cliff Richard has suffered enormous and irreparable damage to his reputation and he is owed an apology.’ Raid: Sir Cliff’s £3million apartment was searched by officers from South Yorkshire and Thames Valley Police as part of an investigation into an alleged sexual assault on a young boy at a religious event in 1985 . 'Damage': Detectives were filmed from a helicopter walking into the singer's £3million Berkshire home . 'Utterly inept': A BBC crew arrived on the scene before the police while Sir Cliff was abroad . Yesterday Sir Cliff’s lawyer, Gideon Benaim, said: ‘Leaving aside the actions of the police, the actions of the BBC have also caused very serious harm to our client at a time when he had not been interviewed by the police, or arrested or charged. ‘The BBC ... coverage has led to immeasurable harm to our client and was both premature and disproportionate.’ Last night a BBC spokesman said: ‘The committee chairman has already said that the BBC acted “perfectly properly” in handling this story, and we’re pleased today’s report confirms this.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","TV reporters were able to film live aerial shots of raid on August 14 .

"After saving their first kiss until after their wedding, it seems as though newlyweds Jessa Duggar and Ben Seewald are eager to make up for lost time. Jessa, 22, shared a candid photo of her husband Ben, 19, gently kissing her cheek on her Instagram account on Friday afternoon, just a few days after posting a picture of the duo sharing a much more passionate embrace. The devout Christian couple, whose strictly-governed courtship has been documented on the hit TLC series 19 Kids and Counting, married in front of more than 1,000 guests and the First Baptist Church in Bentonville, Arkansas on Saturday. Newlyweds: Ben Seewald plants a kiss on the cheek of his wife, Jessa Duggar, less than a week after the pair were married . Up until the ceremony, the pair had only been allowed to see each other while in the presence of a chaperone – while any physical contact between them was limited to sideways hugging and hand holding. Ben and Jessa waited until they were alone to kiss for the first time - unlike Jessa's older sister Jill and her husband, Derick Dillard, who puckered up in front of family and friends during their wedding ceremony in June. The sweet photo has already garnered more than 50,000 likes from the 19 Kids and Counting stars' fans. On Wednesday, Jessa shared another snapshot that showed her and Ben locking lips, with the caption 'It's great living life with your best friend!' Married life: Two days earlier, Jessa shared another snapshot that showed her and Ben locking lips, with the caption 'It's great living life with your best friend!' While the young couple clearly believe that patience is a virtue, rumors have emerged that they consummated their marriage mere hours after tying the knot. According to an alleged wedding guest by the name of 'Mary B', Jessa and Ben were busted by sister Jinger, 20, in a closed room, in the act of 'lust' at the reception in the Arkansas church where they had just been married. 'Multiple people were discussing that when Jinger opened the door to get Jess for the reception, she immediately closed the door with a look of shock on her face,' Mary B wrote on the Christian fundamentalist blog, My Life As A Stay At Home Wife And Mom. Holding hands: Jessa and Ben tied the knot in Bentonville, Arkansas, on Saturday . Worth the wait: Ben and Jessa kissed for the first time when they were alone at the reception . Whether or not 'Mary B' actually attended the wedding, or whether the blog post is a hoax is unclear, but she did mention that her daughter 'knows the girls from Journey to the Heart' - a local religious event. Pastor Mike Schadt, who performed the wedding ceremony, told People that it was important to both Jessa and Ben for their first kiss ever to be in private. 'It was their desire they would share this unique and precious time intimately alone, so just respect that,' Pastor Schadt reportedly told the crowd, when Ben and Jessa left the altar. The location: The couple said their vows in front of more than a thousand guests at the First Baptist Church in Arkansas . Short engagement: Ben proposed to Jessa on August 14, after 11 months of dating, and the pair married on November 1 . 'It is very untraditional not to kiss onstage, but I can tell you they are smooching now. The fact they want to do it alone is very precious,' he added. Ben reportedly wiped away a tear upon seeing Jessa in her blush-colored wedding gown, from Tesori Bridal in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Ben proposed to Jessa on August 14, after 11 months of dating. Shortly after, she changed her Instagram handle to Jessa Seewald, taking Ben's last name. Their courtship was arranged by Jessa's father, Jim Bob Duggar.

"Lovechild? Georgina Ray has claimed to be the daughter of Sir Jimmy Savile and has said she will take a DNA test to prove it . A divorcee who has sensationally claimed to be the secret love child of Sir Jimmy Savile says she is not after a share of his fortune. Georgina Ray, 40, says her mother had a brief fling with the TV star while working as a waitress in the 1970s. Now she is seeking a DNA test to prove she is Sir Jimmy’s daughter. Blonde Mrs Ray, who bears a striking resemblance to the late presenter, is understood to have told lawyers that she is ‘not after any money’. But last night one of her relatives said it was ‘obvious’ she wanted a share of Sir Jimmy’s £2.5million estate. Her cousin Sarah McLaran branded her ‘a gold-digger,’ adding: ‘If she’s not after any money, why didn’t she say anything while he was still alive? ‘It’s obvious she’s doing it for the money. That’s just what she’s like. ‘She’s been having a few money problems since her divorce a couple of years ago. She probably thinks she can get some money out of this.’ Merchandise representative Mrs Ray was born after her mother had a two-week fling with the DJ, a well-known womaniser who died in October aged 84. At the time of the affair, her mother Christine Oakes was 19 and working as a waitress in a greasy spoon cafe off the A5 in Cannock, Staffordshire. She is said to have been ‘awestruck’ when the Top Of The Pops host walked in to the cafe, ordering six eggs sunny side up and two mugs of tea. Sir Jimmy is said to have later ‘carried Christine out of the cafe caveman-style’ and taken her to his camper van. Their . affair was over in only two weeks. But nine months later, Christine – . who now uses her married name Rumford – gave birth to Georgina. Father: Georgina Ray says she was born after Sir Jimmy had a two-week fling with her mother, a cafe waitress, in 1970 . Mrs McLaran said: ‘Christine never actually told me that story about Jimmy, but we all knew that he was Georgina’s dad. ‘I do think Georgina is his, the resemblance is striking. It’s her eyes, her nose, her smile – everything. It’s obvious  she’s Jimmy’s.’ A friend claimed that when Georgina was at school other children there learned who her father was and would tease her by repeating his catchphrases such as ‘Now then, now then’. Christine, now 59, is said to have told her daughter when she was seven years old that Sir Jimmy was her father but forbade her from contacting him. Mrs Ray is understood to have obeyed . her mother’s request until two years ago, when following a difficult . divorce from her husband Ian she decided to write a letter to the TV . star revealing that she was his daughter. Sir Jimmy Savile and on-off girlfriend Sue Hymns who says she met Jimmy when she was 18. The couple had a close, if unconventional, relationship . After receiving no response she is said to have travelled to his luxury flat in Leeds to confront him. But the ageing DJ is said to have spoken to her over the intercom pretending to be someone else, saying: ‘He’s away.’ He then refused to come to the door. Friends also say that Mrs Ray travelled to Leeds to see Sir Jimmy’s coffin, which was put on display in a hotel for three days after his death in October. They say she nearly blurted out that she was his daughter there and then, but decided not to  say anything. The claims first appeared in yesterday’s edition of The Sun. A friend told how Mrs Ray had contacted lawyers to arrange a DNA test on a strand of his famous blond hair taken from his apartment which she is convinced will prove she is his daughter. However, the paper said she was adamant that she does not want any of the star’s cash, with friends insisting she simply wants ‘the truth to be acknowledged’. But her cousin dismissed those claims as ‘a load of rubbish’. Self-confessed womaniser: Sir Jimmy when he was presenting Top of the Pops in 1976 . Mrs McLaran added: ‘Georgina’s never mentioned wanting to meet her father before. I didn’t think she was interested. ‘Now suddenly she is saying she wants to know the truth, and it’s not about the money. I just don’t believe it.’ She said Mrs Ray also showed a ‘sudden interest’ in her mother’s stepfather, Trevor Gough, after he died – despite never speaking to him while he was alive. ‘She was exactly the same then,’ Mrs McLaran said. ‘She was never bothered about seeing him, she was too stuck up. ‘Then when he died, it was Trevor this, Trevor that. Suddenly she wanted to know all about the will. It was obvious what she was after.’ Sir Jimmy’s will has not yet been published, but it has already been announced that his estate will fund a new ‘Savile Institute’ in Leeds devoted to helping heart disease patients. Sir Jimmy Saville poses with young revellers at the Radio One Love Parade in Leeds in 2009. He gave away £45m to charities in his lifetime . The DJ’s family and friends were said to be stunned by Mrs Ray’s love child claim. Sir Jimmy’s nephew Roger Foster said: ‘I was absolutely gobsmacked when I heard about this. ‘Why would someone wait decades before coming forward and saying Jimmy was her dad? ‘I don’t know how much credence I would give her claims. It would be fair to say I’m quite sceptical about them.’ He added that despite his uncle’s ‘vast’ wealth, he did not believe much of it was likely to be left to family anyway. ‘He only ever gave money away to charitable causes – that was the nature of the man,’ Mr Foster said. ‘His will is being handled by bank executors and we don’t know the contents of it yet. ‘But I imagine that however close a relation she is, a will is a will – and if she’s not in it, she’s unlikely to get any money.’ Mrs Ray claimed she had tried to contact Sir Jimmy but to no avail. She visited his coffin at the Queen's Hotel in Leeds after his death . Sir Jimmy's funeral procession passes by The Leeds General Infirmary where he volunteered as a porter in the Sixties . Sir Jimmy was buried in Scarborough last month following three days of remembrance when his coffin was on display in the Leeds hotel; 5,000 people paid their respects. He was laid to rest wearing one of his trademark tracksuits and with three large cigars, and the coffin was angled at 45 degrees because he wanted to ‘see the sea’. Georgina Ray yesterday refused to come to the door of her three-bedroom semi-detached house in Cannock, Staffordshire. A woman at her address said: ‘She doesn’t want to comment on anything. She’s not interested.’ Christine Rumford, her mother, also refused to answer the door  at her home nearby. A woman at her bungalow, who said she  was one of her sisters, said she was feeling unwell and did not wish to comment. Mrs Ray is not the first person to claim a secret connection with Sir Jimmy. After his death, 61-year old divorcee Sue Hymns said they had been secret lovers for 43 years – and that their on-off relationship lasted from 1968 until his death. Miss Hymns, a former PA, claims he told her that marriage and children ‘would never work’ because of his hectic showbusiness lifestyle. She has also said that his first words to her were: ‘Now then, now then.’ Sir Jimmy Savile left more than £5million to charities when he died in October, two  days before his 85th birthday, it  emerged yesterday. But during his lifetime, the generous  presenter is thought to have donated around £45million to charity from his money-raising efforts. His two charity accounts – Jimmy Savile Charitable Trust and the Jimmy Savile Stoke Mandeville Hospital Trust – contained a combined £5.2million on his death. Sir Jimmy helped to establish and fund the National Spinal Injuries unit at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, initially raising about £20m . His devotion to charitable works earned him a knighthood in 1990. The TV legend had also amassed a personal fortune estimated to be worth at least £2.5million, including  five homes. His string of properties included a penthouse flat overlooking Roundhay Park in Leeds, a picturesque cottage in Glencoe, Scotland, a flat in central London, and a home in Bournemouth. Sir Jimmy, who received royalties from shows such as Jim’ll Fix It, which he created, also received around £10,000 a time from public appearances. The executors of his will, a bank, are currently collating his assets and possessions. The details of the will are yet to  be announced.

"A former policeman revealed today that shamed DJ Jimmy Savile was notorious among officers - but no one dared challenge him because he was so well connected. Paul Leonard, 68, said he once approached the celebrity's Rolls-Royce at 11.45pm when it was stopped in a lay-by in Leeds and caught him with a young girl. But Savile made it clear to the officer that he was to be left alone with the teenager. Paedophile: Jimmy Savile with his Rolls-Royce in 1966. A year before police officer found the DJ in his car with a young girl in a lay by . 'I'm waiting for midnight when she turns 16... so p*** off if you want to keep your job,' Savile told the officer, according to the Daily Mirror. Mr Leonard - who had his name changed by the newspaper - reported the incident to his Sergeant but was told that the television star had 'friends in high places' and was ordered to drop it. Disgraced: Savile, who died aged 84, was notorious with the police in Leeds who were powerless to stop him because 'he was well-connected' The officer said it was well known among police in Leeds that Savile 'liked them young'. The chilling incident happened in 1965, when Savile was a well-known DJ locally in Leeds, but it was before he found fame on Radio 1. In the decades after the missed chance to stop him, the paedophile star went on to abuse hundreds of young people across the country. Mr Leonard said when he spotted the car parked in a secluded lay-by near Roundhay Golf Club, Leeds he thought it was stolen. The officer - who was patrolling on a Noddy bike - said that the young girl in the car with Savile looked like she was aged around 15. Mr Leonard said he asked the girl if she was OK and she smiled back at him. He added that Savile was very calm despite being caught with such a young girl. 'He wasn't angry. it was more like bragging. I was only young and worried about keeping my job so I left them,' he added. 'Looking back I feel bad about it, but he had so much influence. I would definitely have lost my job.' Mr Leonard said that the DJ, who was . never exposed as a sexual predator in his lifetime, had police officers . in Leeds in the 'palm of his hand'. The former officer stayed with the police force for three more years until 1968 when he moved on. Mr Leonard's claims provide fresh evidence that police covered up Savile's abuse for decades. The Radio 1 DJ is thought to have raped . 34 women and girls and sexually assaulted up to 450 people, including . some as young as eight, according to an official report. He died two . years ago, aged 84. Yesterday it was revealed that a . former police inspector ‘acted on behalf’ of Jimmy Savile before his . controversial interview over sex assaults of teenage girls. A West Yorkshire-based officer is alleged to have contacted Surrey Police before its detectives interviewed Savile in 2009. Transcripts . of the interviews – released by the force this week – provoked anger as . they appeared to show detectives adopting a kid-glove approach to the . DJ and paedophile who was being accused of sexually assaulted girls at a . school in Staines during the 1970s. Abuser: Disgraced Jimmy Savile posing with his Rolls-Royce car in 1964. Mr Leonard revealed today that he discovered the star in his car with a young girl in Leeds in 1965 . Abuser: DJ Jimmy Saville was interviewed by detectives in 2009 - but a chance to catch him was missed . The disgraced broadcaster told detectives that he had been targeted with false claims by blackmailers, and said: ‘I have up in Yorkshire, where I live in Leeds, a collection of senior police persons who come to see me socially, but I give them all my weirdo letters.’ The informal meetings between Savile and police at his flat in Leeds were known as the ‘Friday Morning Club’. During the remarkable interview, the disgraced DJ accused his victims of trying to blackmail him and said 'normally you can brush them away like midges'. He told police: 'We showbiz people get accused of just about everything. One of the reasons is people are looking for money, and they will try blackmail, and they will write letters, saying if you don’t send us money, I will say you’ve done this and you’ve done that. 'That’s why I have up in Yorkshire, where I live in Leeds, a collection of senior police persons, who come to see me socially,  I give them all my weirdo letters, and they take them back to the station. 'You would be amazed at the depth that they go to. Wearing my Broadmoor hat, I don’t find it amazing at all, because wearing the Broadmoor hat, people do strange things. The strangest of strange things.' It has emerged that the interview took place months after the West Yorkshire inspector first contacted Surrey Police over their plans to quiz Savile about the ‘historic’ sex allegations. The officer told Surrey Police that he knew the DJ ‘personally’ and allegedly brokered the interview with Savile. Last night the Independent Police Complaints Commission revealed that a preliminary probe had been launched into the claims but this would now become a full investigation. Victim: Jill Bartlett fell pregnant after being raped by Jimmy Savile when she was 16. She criticised the police's questioning techniques . In the interview, lasting just 56 minutes, Savile denied claims he forced one girl to touch his groin, made another perform a sex act and stuck his tongue down a young girl’s throat. He claimed that the women were looking to make money out of the allegations, which were put to him during an interview in his office at Stoke Mandeville Hospital on October 1, 2009. It was not clear last night whether the officer, who has since left West Yorkshire Police, was among those officers who attended Savile’s ‘Friday Morning Club’. Victims of Savile and child protection campaigners called for an independent inquiry into the police dealings with the Top of the Pops star. This is a transcript of the interview conducted by Surrey Police with Savile in October 2009. It was released earlier this year by the force following a Freedom of Information request . Last night, Jill Bartlett, who was raped by Savile, falling pregnant at the age of 16, said there should be an inquiry. She said: ‘Jimmy Savile was very persuasive, but police should have training so they’re not fooled. All kinds of criminals and psychopaths are persuasive and the police should be above that. ‘I think there should be a full inquiry into their dealings with him. He was known as someone who liked young women, and the police should have known about it and acted.’ Keir Starmer promises changes over abuse charges . Caroline Moore, who was 13 and recovering from an operation on a children’s ward at the hospital when Savile stuck his tongue down her throat, called for an inquiry into the police. The 54-year-old, who is disabled and from Clarkston, East Renfrewshire, said: ‘There should be a proper investigation into all the social meetings Savile said he had with police. Not an internal police investigation, because no one really has faith in them any more.’ Sylvia Edwards was 19 when she was groped by Savile after he put his hand up her skirt during a live broadcast of Top of the Pops in 1976. Cameras caught her shrieking and moving away from him. Yesterday, she said: ‘I honestly think the police should be held accountable. There should be an inquiry and people should be made to stand up. The (police officers) should be named.’ Asked whether Surrey Police missed an opportunity to prosecute Savile while he was still alive, she said: ‘I don’t think they missed it, I think they deliberately ignored it because of who he was.’ Child protection expert Mark Williams-Thomas, a former Surrey Police detective, said: ‘It’s clear that over a period of time complaints were made about Savile and information was held about him and I think it’s fair to say West Yorkshire Police’s report was a whitewash. It was very poor.’ Operation Newgreen, a West Yorkshire Police report published this year, found no evidence that Savile was shielded from arrest and protected from prosecution by his relationship with the force. A spokesman for the IPCC said: ‘The Commission has begun an independent investigation in relation to the alleged actions of a former inspector with West Yorkshire Police. 'The allegations refer to the officer having “acted on behalf” of Jimmy Savile by inappropriately contacting Surrey Police ahead of a police interview.’ Accusations: Jimmy Savile visited Duncroft Approved School for Girls in the 1970s, pictured here in 1974, where he allegedly attacked several young women. It is not suggested that any of the women are in this picture .","Officer called Surrey Police detectives before questioning started in 2009 .

"One in three shops in Britain's high streets lie empty despite the economic recovery, researchers have warned. Retailers lay blame with out-of-town supermarkets, online shopping, expensive parking and high business rates. The figures also underline the severity of the North-South wealth divide. Scroll down for video . Shut: In Harlepool, County Durham, 27.3 per cent of stores in the town are up for rent . Second worst was Stockport in Greater Manchester which has seen the number of empty shops go up – despite being one of 27 'Portas Towns' to get £100,000 ­government grants to attract shoppers . The image shows the towns in Britain that have the most stores up for rent - Hartlepool has the worst vacancy rate with 27.3 per cent of stores up for rent. The map shows the vacancy rate is highest in the North West . Hartlepool in County Durham has the worst vacancy rate, with 27.3 per cent of stores up for rent. This is followed by Stockport in Greater Manchester, with 27.2 per cent and Walsall, in the West Midlands, at 26.5 per cent. The figures come from a study of 3,000 town centres and retail parks by Local Data Company. The vacancy rate in the North West - the worst-hit area - is 16.9 per cent. It has risen in the last year by 0.4 per cent in the North East to 16.4 per cent. In contrast, London's vacancy is 7.9 per cent. The figures also underline the severity of the North-South wealth divide, with the North West the worst-hit area . Walsall, in the West Midlands, has 26.5 per cent empty shops - retailers lay blame with out-of-town supermarkets, online shopping, expensive parking and high business rates . 1) The North West - worst region at 16.9 per cent . 2) The North East - up 0.4 per cent to 16.4 per cent . 3) London - 7.9 per cent . 4) Whole of the UK - 11.9 per cent . Matthew Hopkinson, of Local Data Company, told the Sunday Mirror: 'Of the top 10 worst town centres for vacant retail and leisure premises, all of which are above 23 per cent, six are in the North East or North West. 'Of the top 10 best-performing town centres with the least vacant units, seven are in London and the South East.' He added: 'People have to realise these town centres are not going back to pre-2008 levels and accept at least 20 per cent of shops there are no longer required. They have got to create smaller centres that pull viable businesses into a vibrant core.' The British Retail Consortium said the way rates are set is unfair on high street shops and has called for a reform of the business rates system. It said retailers pay £7billion a year - which is £500million more than three years ago. Another problem for high street shops is that more than 10 per cent of retail spending is now online, while many shoppers go to out-of-town retail parks to avoid pricey town centre parking charges. 'Portas Towns' got £100,000 ­government grants . In 2012 TV guru Mary Portas was appointed by the government to bring about a revival in areas worst affected by the economic downturn and the rise of out-of-town shopping centres. The businesswoman and presenter was hired to turn around town centres in places like Bedford, Dartford and Margate, with a share of a £1.2million fund. The first 12 Portas Pilot towns were Bedford in Bedfordshire, Croydon in Greater London, Dartford in Kent, Bedminster in Bristol, Liskeard in Cornwall, Margate in Kent, Market Rasen in Lincolnshire, Nelson in Lancashire, Newbiggin by the Sea in Northumberland, Stockport in Greater Manchester, Stockton on Tees in Teesside and Wolverhampton in the West Midlands. They were promised an injection of life, with more markets, better branding and pop-up shops. Ideas included ‘guerilla gardening’, street art, town criers and bicycle rickshaw services. However, many of her main recommendations including free parking and cheaper business rates were not taken up by ministers. She also faced criticism for the review with some calling it 'too nostalgic' and a 'PR stunt'. Since the dark ages, governments have used a tax on residential and commercial property to pay for local services. But store groups are struggling to keep their costs and prices down to fend off competition from online rivals. The problem is not so much the imbalance in the amount of corporation tax paid by the likes of Amazon and Starbucks - compared with their UK-domiciled rivals - but business rates. At a time when online sales are rising fast and traditional retailers are struggling, business rates are effectively a tax on the high street. Internet retailers pay zero in terms of business rates because they have no bricks and mortar stores - in other words, high street buildings. However, the traditional store chains find they are seeing profits fall but are paying a lot more in business rates. The unfairness has become a hot political issue and it is a key topic being discussed at the Labour Party conference in Manchester last week. Labour wants a 1 per cent cut in business rates if it wins the 2015 General Election. This is worth around £1billion. More than 100 business leaders have called for the changes.","One in three shops in high streets lie empty despite economic recovery .

"Bailed: Davidson, pictured with his fifth wife Michelle Cotton, was arrested as part of Operation Yewtree . Jim Davidson has pulled out of Celebrity Big Brother after he was arrested on suspicion of sexual offences yesterday by police investigating the Jimmy Savile child abuse scandal. The 59-year-old comedian was detained at Heathrow after returning to the UK from Dubai ahead of a planned appearance on the reality TV show, which starts tonight. Davidson was taken to a London police station and questioned for hours on suspicion of committing sexual offences before being released on bail until March. And now MailOnline understands that Channel 5 has agreed to re-jig its line-up at the last minute after talks with the comedian. 'Everyone has agreed that it's for the best,' a source from the TV station said, but it is not yet known who will replace him. Last night his solicitor said in a . statement that the comedian ‘vigorously denies’ the allegations, which . he said dated back about 25 years. In October Davison, who formerly . hosted BBC shows Big Break and The Generation Game, publicly labelled . the Savile investigation a ‘witch hunt’. On his blog he wrote: ‘The Savile . witch hunt is going a bit silly now. We all are starting to speculate . and accuse ... even in jest. So no, I don’t know who’s next. ‘Everyone has had the nod. Everyone is . an expert. 'Just pick someone you don’t like and say it’s them. 'As odd . as he was, Savile can’t defend himself. 'The bloke’s dead for God’s sake. Let’s move on.’ Missing: With the show now in full swing, the Big Brother House is without Jim Davidson after he pulled out . Davidson had flown to London yesterday . to give a series of interviews in advance of his appearance on . Celebrity Big Brother on Channel 5.

Police also arrested a 53-year-old man . at his home in Hampshire at 8am yesterday on suspicion of committing . sexual offences. The suspect, who is thought to be a DJ who has worked . with Davidson, was taken to a nearby police station for questioning. Davidson has often courted controversy by telling offensive jokes about ethnic minorities, homosexuals and the disabled. He has divorced four times and in 2011 . married his fifth wife, Michelle Cotton, 17 years his junior. Last . night his solicitor Henri Brandman said: ‘Two women have made . allegations in respect of Jim that date back approximately 25 years. The . complainants were then in their mid-twenties. ‘Jim vigorously denies the allegations. He answered police questions as fully as he was able after this passage of time. ‘He has not been charged with any offence. Neither he nor I will be making any further comment.’ Davidson and the 53-year-old man are . the ninth and tenth arrests made in the Savile investigation, called . Operation Yewtree. Detectives are working through an arrest list of . people who could be questioned about allegations made by victims of . Savile or others associated with him. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘A . 53-year-old man was arrested at approximately 8am at an address in . Hampshire and taken into custody locally. ‘A 59-year-old man was arrested at approximately midday in West London and taken into custody at a London police station.’ Search: There was no sign of Jim Davidson at his country home as police officers visited the £820,000 property .

Arrests: Davidson and an unnamed 53-year-old were on the same day  as police investigate accusations made in the wake of revelations about disgraced Jimmy Savile . Scotland Yard said a total of 31 allegations of rape have been made against Savile so far. And 589 people have come forward with . information relating to the scandal, with a total of 450 complaints . against the BBC presenter and DJ himself, mainly alleging sexual abuse, . police said. Held: Ted Beston was arrested by police and bailed . Ten weeks after the launch of . Operation Yewtree, police recorded 199 crimes in 17 force areas in which . Savile is a suspect, with 31 allegations of rape. Others who have been arrested include . former pop star Gary Glitter, comedian Freddie Starr and publicist Max . Clifford. Those three are on police bail. The . investigation has three strands, one dealing with allegations directly . involving Jimmy Savile, the second involving allegations against . associates of the disgraced DJ and the third involving 'others'. Operation Yewtree has already cost around £2million and involves a team of 30 officers. In December a man from London in his 60s was arrested on suspicion of sexual offences. PR guru Max Clifford was then arrested on suspicion of sexual offences but was later bailed as part of the probe. A man aged in his 80s from Berkshire was interviewed by detectives three weeks ago.

"The 39-degree heat in Fortaleza meant Holland and Mexico were given the World Cup's first official 'cooling break', as fans were seen retreating to the back of the stands to avoid the scorching sun.

Sweet strike: Rodriguez lines up his volley which gave Fernando Muslera no chance in the Uruguay goal . No stopping that one: Uruguay's goalkeeper Fernando Muslera has no chance in stopping Rodriguez's shot . Cloud nine: Colombia fans celebrate knocking Uruguay out of the World Cup . James Rodriguez was a 100-1 outsider to win the Golden Boot behind more well-known players such as Lionel Messi and Neymar. But the Colombian midfielder struck twice in the last 16 clash with Uruguay and now has five goals in the tournament and leads the race to be the top goal scorer. Rodriguez is now as short as 2-1 to end the World Cup with the Golden Boot . It was a . match of karmic delight. Colombia got what they deserved: a . quarter-final date with Brazil that will leave the hosts more than a . little apprehensive; Uruguay got what they deserved: nothing and the . bum’s rush to the airport. They were confirmed as a one-man team, their . shameful indulgence of Suarez’s worst excesses exposed as nothing more . than a shield to cover their own inadequacies. Uruguay must tolerate . Suarez, for without him they offer so little. They . have played 22 World Cup matches with him since 2010 and have lost . five. They have played five without him in that time, and lost four. Once he was gone it was a matter of time before they followed. How . fitting that the architect of their downfall was the player of the . tournament so far, 22, but looking younger, an anti-Suarez, playing with . a smile not a snarl. Man of the moment: Rodriguez celebrates his goal as Colombia beat Uruguay . Pick that one out: Rodriguez celebrates his wonder goal . James’s . bite in Brazil has come from having decisive influence on Colombia’s . impressive progress, not a malevolent act of aggravated harm, and it was . fitting that Uruguay’s unlovable apologists were removed from the . competition by his wit and talent, an elevation of football’s spirit . that was met with joy in the fitting surrounds of the Maracana Stadium. By . the end, the Uruguayans in the crowds were reacting angrily to . Colombian mockery of their limitations. Good. They deserved it. Many . turned up with their Suarez masks and chants and a well-honed victim . mentality encouraged by their coach Oscar Tabarez, but it was not . enough. They will depart feeling hard done by, but were not. The best . team won. The good guys, too. Colombia . are deserved quarter-finalists and Brazil will not look forward to . facing them on this evidence. James in particular, is an exquisite . talent, a player of true fantasy, capable of scoring a goal to grace any . game, in any competition, and certainly worthy of this famous stadium. The execution was close to perfect. At the double: Rodriguez puts Colombia 2-0 up with a close range strike . In it goes: Rodriguez scores his fifth goal of the tournament . Dream land: Rodriguez dances with team-mates Teofilo Gutierrez, Juan Guillermo Cuadrado and Juan Camilo Zuniga . The . play was switched from one flank to the other, for a cross headed out . by Uruguay’s Maximiliano Pereira. It was put back in, hopefully, by Abel . Aguilar and fell to James. He took the ball on his chest, pivoted, . checked his position and volleyed it with his left foot from 20 yards. The . ball dipped over Fernando Muslera’s despairing hand, struck the . crossbar – as the greatest-looking goals often do – and bounced down and . over the line. Fans of a certain age may know this as a Tony Yeboah. There . were cheers when it went in, but gasps for the many replays. It was a . special goal, one that will be replayed, revisited and savoured . throughout the coming weeks. Colombia’s next, while not as spectacular, . was equally well worked. Marching on: Colombia fans celebrate as their side beat Uruguay and progress to play Brazil . Dreamland: Colombia fans back their country in the Maracana . Another . lovely passing move found its way out to Pablo Armero and his deep . cross was met by the impressive Juan Cuadrado, unselfishly cushioning a . gentle header back into the path of James, who finished smartly from . close range. Uruguay were done. Colombia eased off after that, but . without fear of reprisal. Minus Suarez, Uruguay are snarky, but . toothless. Their captain, Diego Lugano, managed to get booked for . complaining from the substitutes bench, which seemed appropriate. James . will turn 23 on the eve of the final if Colombia stick around, and has . now scored in every game of Colombia’s four, the first player to perform . this feat in the competition since Ronaldo and Rivaldo for Brazil in . 2002. The two R’s – there was a third, of course, in Ronaldinho – were . playing for the eventual world champions, though. A free-scoring, . free-wheeling Brazilian team, dragged from the wreckage of a horrid . qualifying campaign by Luis Felipe Scolari and transformed into . something quite miraculous. On a different level:  Colombia out classed Uruguay as Zuniga has a shot at goal . First to the ball: Juan Cuadrado beats  Uruguay's Jose Maria Gimenez to the ball . James, . by contrast, is not playing for one of the world’s superpowers, or . tournament favourites – certainly not since Falcao was invalided out of . the action towards the end of last season. Yet he currently tournament . top scorer having started the competition the same price to win the . Golden Boot as Rickie Lambert, who made it onto the pitch for three . minutes in a single game against Uruguay. Who says the English are . deluded? Falcao, . a powerful striker of the type that is so popular right now, was seen . as crucial to Colombian hopes and, without him, it was feared Jose . Pekerman’s team would be shorn of their cutting edge. Now they have to . be considered an outside bet for the competition such is the optimism . inspired by James’s form. He scores, he creates, he torments, he tests. Face in the crowd: Uruguay's fans hold up cardboard cut outs of suspended Luis Suarez . The joke's on you: Uruguay fans wear fake fangs and a dog mask to mock Suarez's bite against Italy . Already . a £37.5m player after moving from Porto to Monaco, he may well yet be . one of the stellar transfers in Europe this summer, on the back of this . campaign. A goalscorer, a match-winner, a classic number ten but with . the heart and energy required of the modern game, he has looked a cut . above many of the more famous names on display in Brazil and has now . scored in Colombia’s last six matches. Who could afford him – and, of . those that could, who wouldn’t want him? Out . here, in the international game, Brazil would love him, so too Spain or . Germany and Italy have nothing like him, either. England? Well, we’d . find a way of ruining him obviously, but that’s not the point. James has . been a thing of beauty at this World Cup and Brazil will not enjoy . dealing with his invention in Fortaleza next Friday. It is often said . that Scolari’s team it stronger defensively than going forward, and it . will need to be. Yet Colombia showed they could defend, too – not least . enforcer and captain Mario Yepes and goalkeeper David Ospina. Their . passing was, at times, superb, producing enthusiastic cries of ole from . their fervent, colourful support. Brazil, obviously, intimidate their . continental rivals, as was shown in yesterday’s penalty shoot-out with . Chile, when all confidence seemed to drain from Jorge Sampaoli’s men. Colombia will need to overcome those feelings of inadequacy, too. Yet . one player, at least, has nothing to feel inferior about. James is . being mentioned in the same breath as some of the greatest players to . ever wear Brazil’s yellow shirt. He is having the tournament of a . lifetime. Come July 12, he may have a lot more to celebrate than just . turning 23.","James Rodriguez scores wonder volley to send Colombia through .

"Italy boss Cesare Prandelli quit on Monday night after his side were controversially eliminated from the World Cup. While England boss Roy Hodgson stays on despite exiting the tournament with only a point, Prandelli fell on his sword, along with Italian FA president Giancarlo Abete, after an 81st-minute goal from Diego Godin put Uruguay through to the last 16. It is the second World Cup in a row that Italy have gone out at the group stage. They won the competition in 2006. VIDEO Prandelli tenders Azzurri resignation . Disappointment: Cesare Prandelli (right) comforts keeper Gianluigi Buffon after Italy's loss to Uruguay . Comforting: Prandelli, who quit as Italy boss after the match, consoles his players on the bench in Natal . Pick it out: Italy were going through the last 16 at 0-0 before Diego Godin broke the deadlock for Uruguay . VIDEO Fans say Prandelli must go . Prandelli told his post-match press conference: 'I talked to the president of the federation.. and gave my resignation. 'The technical set-up didn't work, and I take all responsibility for that. 'Something . has changed since my contract was renewed. I don't know why. I chose a . certain technical plan and that's why I'm resigning - because it did not . work.' Prandelli . added: 'A second European Championship, third at the Confederations . [Cup] and the qualification obtained in advance should not be . under-estimated. 'The match was well-balanced in equal numbers, but the sending-off changed it all.' Prandelli was not the only man to fall on his sword with president Giancarlo Abete also stepping down. He said he would recommend that Prandelli changes his mind, but that he himself was going. 'I . will go to the board and offer my irrevocable resignation too. I had . already made this decision before the World Cup,' he said. Towering: Godin rises to scores the only goal of the match for Uruguay to send Italy packing .

"We are at the World Cup semi-final stage and the heavyweights of international football are getting ready to square up with Brazil and Germany, two of the biggest footballing powers on the planet, meeting on Tuesday in Belo Horizonte. Brazil: the hosts and winners of five World Cups, the most in history. Germany: three-time victors who rarely fail to make the quarter-finals. Here, Sportsmail takes a look at the likely starting XIs and how they match up against each other. Scroll down to see the final score . Relaxed: Brazil's Dani Alves (left) and David Luiz (right) train ahead of Tuesday's crunch semi-final . Julio Cesar (QPR) – Age 34, Caps 85 . Barley played a club game last season but boss Luiz Felipe Scolari has kept faith and he was the penalty shootout hero in their last 16 win against Chile. Mixed: Julio Cesar starred in the last 16 shootout win over Chile but gave away a spot-kick against Colombia . Manuel Neuer (Bayern Munich) – Age 28, Caps 50 . Arguably the best goalkeeper in the world, and turning it on at this World Cup. Made some outstanding saves to send them through in the quarter-final against France. Safe hands: Manuel Neuer has been in excellent form, keeping three clean sheets in five games so far . VIDEO All Star XI: Manuel Neuer highlights . Verdict: The Germany goalkeeper has been a colossus in the tournament, keeping three clean sheets and conceding just three goals in five games, setting him apart from his counterparts. Right-back . Dani Alves (Barcelona) – Age 31, Caps 79, International goals 6 . Missed the last round, presumably to avoid suspension having been on one yellow card. One of the best full-backs in the game. Back in action: Dani Alves was rested against Colombia but looks set to start against the Germans . Philipp Lahm (Bayern Munich) – Age 30, Caps 111, International goals 5 . Played as a defensive midfielder in the early rounds, but now back to his favoured right-back position and dominating that flank. Versatile: Philipp Lahm should keep his place at right-back after playing in midfield during the group stage . VIDEO All Star XI: Philipp Lahm highlights . Verdict: Dani Alves would win hands-down against most other right-backs, but not Lahm. He is the best out there in his position. Marcelo (Real Madrid) – Age 26, Caps 36, International goals 4 . Occasionally erratic in defence, fearless going forward. Marcelo adds an extra element of flair to Brazil's attack. On the attack: Real Madrid defender Marcelo (right) will get forward for Brazil against Joachim Low's side . Benedikt Howedes (Schalke) – Age 26, Caps 26, International goals 2 . Usually a centre-back for Schalke he has sacrificed his own comfort for the good of his country, but is yet to shine in the tournament. Physical: Benedikt Howedes (front) holds off the challenge of France's Yohan Cabaye in the quarter-final . Verdict: Given Howedes is playing out of position, it has to go to Marcelo who can produce a moment of brilliance in a flash. Centre-back . Dante (Bayern Munich) – Age 30, Caps 12, International goals 2 . Expected to come in for the suspended Thiago Silva having been forced to watch the rest of the tournament from the bench. Under huge pressure. Big opportunity: Bayern Munich's Dante looks set to replace the suspended Thiago Silva on Tuesday . Jerome Boateng (Bayern Munich) – Age 25, Caps 44, International goals 2 . A solid centre-half but has been too often bailed out by goalkeeper Neuer throughout the tournament. Nonetheless, started every game for Germany. Fortunate: Germany defender Jerome Boateng (right) has been made to look better by his keeper Neuer . Verdict: These two are polar opposites in this tournament – Boateng has played virtually every minute while Dante is starting cold. Based on that, the German wins it. David Luiz (Chelsea) – Age 27, Caps 41, International goals 2 . Nicknamed Sideshow Bob for his wild hairstyle, Luiz has been among the best entertainers at this summer's feast of football. After sealing a £50million move from Chelsea to Paris Saint-Germain, the 27-year-old will now take on the captain's armband in the absence of the suspended Thiago Silva as he bids to lead his country into the final. He has two goals in his last two games having not scored one for his country before the tournament. Pure passion: David Luiz celebrates scoring a stunning free-kick against Colombia in the last eight . Mats Hummels (Borussia Dortmund) – Age 25, Caps 34, International goals 4 . The defender is becoming one of the hottest properties on the market for his displays during this World Cup. Scored the winner against France when he outmuscled Raphael Varane to head in a free-kick. Key man: Mats Hummels seured Germany's place in the semi-finals with the winning goal against France in Rio . Verdict: If it was sheer passion and putting on a show, David Luiz would get the nod. But defending is about solidity and reliability, and Hummels is streaks ahead in those departments. Central midfield . Luiz Gustavo (Wolfsburg) – Age 26, Caps 23, International goals 1 . Brazil's midfield enforcer has been kicking, thumping and bashing his way through this World Cup, to devastating effect. Back from a one-match suspension, he will be chomping at the bit. Hard man: Luiz Gustavo (right) will attempt to break up Germany attacks in the centre of midfield . Sami Khedira (Real Madrid) – Age 27, Caps 50, International goals 4 . Arsenal target Khedira has done little wrong but also little to inspire so far, although, in fairness, he has not played much for Real Madrid over the past year due to injury. Solid: Real Madrid man Sami Khedira (left) has enjoyed a productive but unspectacular tournament so far . Verdict: Luiz Gustavo strikes fear into the heart of opponents, and it works. Central midfield . Fernandinho (Manchester City) – Age 29, Caps 10, International goals 2 . Has improved with age and was a key player for City in their title-winning season, but still very inexperienced in international football, especially for someone pushing 30. Getting stuck in: Fernandinho (right) showed off the physical side of his game against James Rodriguez (left) when Brazil met Colombia . Bastian Schweinsteiger (Bayern Munich) – Age 29, Caps 106, International goals 23 . He brings on to the pitch a wealth of experience and a decent scoring rate from central midfield. Has looked happier being the leader of the midfield again with Lahm's switch back to right-back. Experienced: Bastian Schweinsteiger already has 106 caps and 23 goals for his country . Verdict: Schweinsteiger has 10 times as many caps as Fernandinho, despite being the same age, and is one of the most accomplished in the world at his position. Hulk (Porto) – Age 27, Caps 39, International goals 9 . Known for his pile-driver of a shot, but has still never scored for Brazil in a competitive match. His performances have been erratic in this tournament. Room for improvement: Forward Hulk is yet to open his account for Brazil at the World Cup . Thomas Muller (Bayern Munich) – Age 24, Caps 54, International goals 21 . His World Cup finals record says it all: 11 played, nine won, just one lost, having scored nine goals. Danger man: Thomas Muller (left), pictured here scoring against the USA, has four goals to his name in Brazil . Verdict: Muller is far superior in almost every way. The German wins this easily. Oscar (Chelsea) – Age 22, Caps 36, International goals 10 . Oscar's form dipped midway through the season for Chelsea and that has carried into the World Cup. He has sporadically played well but has been far too erratic. The Brazilians will be looking to him to raise it with Neymar out. Expectation: Oscar (left) will need to embrace more creative responsibility with talisman Neymar out injured . Toni Kroos (Bayern Munich) – Age 24, Caps 49, International goals 5 . His passing ability is immense, but doesn't seem to score the amount of goals his position should warrant. And that is strange, as his goal against Arsenal in the Champions League demonstrated his shooting prowess. Pass master: Bayern Munich's Toni Kroos (front) will look to dictate play from the centre of midfield . Verdict: A tough one to call, but Kroos edges it. His performances have been better in this tournament than Oscar's. Left attacking midfield . Willian (Chelsea) – Age 25, Caps 10, International goals 2 . Likely to be drafted into the side with Neymar out injured. Has featured little in the early rounds, coming on as a late subsitute three times. Chance: Chelsea midfielder Willian is expected to replace the injured Neymar in Brazil's starting XI . VIDEO Willian ready to fill Neymar's boots . Mesut Ozil (Arsenal) – Age 25, Caps 60, International goals 18 . The Arsenal man has had a quiet tournament, much like his first season in English football. Whenever he gets the ball it feels like something will happen, and then it doesn't. Time to deliver: Mesut Ozil (left) has failed to shine for his country but he could play a major part for Low's side . Verdict: Ozil has to get this one, merely because Willian has barely played any football in the competition. Striker . Fred (Fluminese) – Age 30, Caps 38, International goals 18 . Luiz Felipe Scolari has defended Fred resolutely amid criticism for his lack of goals – just one, a header from an offside position two yards out – and overall play. Flop: Striker Fred has scored once so far but has put in a series of poor performances for the Selecao . Miroslav Klose (Lazio) – Age 36, Caps 135, International goals 70 . One of the greatest strikers in World Cup history. Needs just one goal, playing in his fourth World Cup, to become outright top-scorer in the tournament's history ahead of Ronaldo. Motivation: Miroslav Klose (right) needs just one goal against Brazil to become the World Cup's all-time leading scorer . Verdict: Klose; no question.","Hosts Brazil take on Germany in Belo Horizonte for a place in the final .

"Italy's Vincenzo Nibali launched a late attack to win stage two of the Tour de France in Sheffield on Sunday and claim the race leader's yellow jersey. Hundreds of thousands of people again lined the 201-kilometre route from York on a brutal and unpredictable day of racing. Nibali (Astana), the 2013 Giro d'Italia champion, left it late but timed his bid to the line to perfection to secure victory ahead of a number of his rivals for the overall title. He also claimed the race leader's maillot jaune, from stage one winner Marcel Kittel (Giant-Shimano), who endured a difficult day. VIDEO Scroll down for a guide to each Tour de France stage .

The Spaniard was unchallenged until, within sight of the summit, defending champion Chris Froome (Team Sky) stretched his legs. The descent saw and run-in saw numerous attempts to break off the front, all of which floundered until Nibali burst clear inside the final 2km. The Italian champion, nicknamed the Shark, bared his teeth and led by 50metres under the flamme rouge at 1km to go and his rivals looked to each other to react. World champion Rui Costa (Lampre) led the pursuit, with Froome on his wheel, but the lack of a coordinated chase ensured Nibali would win and he was able to celebrate a first Tour stage win of his career. On their way: Riders make their way past York Minster at the start of the second stage of the Tour de France . One for the album: Fans take photos as the peloton passes York Minster . Belgian Greg van Avermaet (BMC Racing) was second, two seconds behind, with Michal Kwiatkowski (Omega Pharma-QuickStep) third. Contador was 13th and Froome 19th, the Briton moving to fifth overall after his sixth-placed finish in Harrogate on day one. Germany's Kittel relinquished the fabled yellow jersey without much of a defence on a challenging day for the sprinter in the Yorkshire countryside. Kittel had a day to forget, finishing well adrift, but will chase a sixth Tour stage win in two editions in Monday's 155km third stage from Cambridge to The Mall in London. The second day of racing in Yorkshire began with Mark Cavendish (Omega Pharma-QuickStep) announcing his withdrawal following his crash in Harrogate.

The Manxman would not have relished a day as challenging as this, with nine categorised climbs to negotiate - five in the final 60km - and numerous more ascents in between. Perrig Quemeneur (Europcar), Matthew Busche (Trek), Cyril Lemoine (Cofidis), David de la Cruz (NetApp), Armindo Fonseca (Bretagne) and Blel Kadri (Ag2r La Mondiale) initiated the day's break before Bart De Clercq (Lotto-Belisol) managed to latch on.

Four more climbs were to follow, but the peloton stayed together to the summit of the penultimate climb when Pierre Rolland (Europcar) and Jean-Christophe Peraud (Ag2r La Mondiale) surged clear. Peraud was reluctant to work with his compatriot and was swept up before Rolland's lone attempt to stay away ended with 8km to go.

"A child has been photographed dressed up in a costume that resembles a terrorist outfit - complete with a grenade vest and fake gun - as part of Eid celebrations in Pakistan. In the picture, the young Pakistani boy wears a long-haired wig, beret and military vest and carries on him a fake grenade and toy guns. He is celebrating with relatives the Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha (Feast of Sacrifice). The Pakistani boy pictured dressed in militant clothes while visiting a picnic spot in Islamabad's suburbs . The holiday honours the prophet Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his chosen son as an act of submission to God. According to the scripture, God intervenes at the last minute to replace Abraham's son with a sheep - an act which forms the basis of its modern celebrations. In remembrance, Muslim faithful will slaughter sheep, cattle, camels and other livestock in an act of sacrifice to show gratitude for their blessings. They then divide the meat into three equal portions - keeping some of it for themselves, giving a third to the poor and giving the final third to relatives, friends and neighbours.

In addition to offering Eid prayers, gifts and social events are a central part of the holiday, which begins at the end of the hajj pilgrimage . A monkey collects money after entertaining people enjoying the festival in an Islamabad, Pakistan park . Sunday marked the start of festivities for Iraqi Shiites and the majority of Indonesians, while Pakistani Muslims started to celebrate the festival on Monday. The festival is celebrated by all Muslims but it occurs on slightly different days depending on location because it is held according to the Muslim lunar calendar and moon sightings. Saturday also marked the first time since 1981 that both Muslims and Jews are celebrating major holidays at the same time. Eid al-Adha coincides with the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur once every 33 years based on their lunar calendars. Yom Kippur is Judaism's Day of Atonement, when devout Jews ask God to forgive them for their transgressions and refrain from eating and drinking, attending intense prayer services in synagogues. The holiday began at sunset Friday and ended Saturday night. Pilgrims perform the Stoning of the Devil ritual on the third day of Eid al-Adha in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.

"This is the incredible moment brave brain tumour patient Ashya King took his first steps on the road to recovery after his parents' long battle for pioneering therapy. Five-year-old Ashya managed to raise his arm and give a wave as he was helped by his mother Naghmeh, 45, and father Brett, 51, down a hospital corridor in Prague, Czech Republic. The youngster, who was at the centre of an international manhunt after his parents took him out of Southampton General Hospital because they believed NHS treatment would have left him deaf, blind and brain damaged, has just finished his final session of proton therapy treatment. Scroll down for videos . Loving: Ashya King, five, managed to raise his arm and give a wave as he was helped by his mother Naghmeh, 45, and father Brett, 51, down a hospital corridor in Prague, Czech Republic, following the last of his treatment . Recovery: After taking his first tentative steps, Ashya was wheeled out of the specialist centre ahead of his family's move to Spain. The youngster has spent six weeks receiving pioneering proton therapy treatment . He has spent the last six weeks at the Czech Proton Therapy Centre where he has received 30 sessions of the pioneering treatment which his parents hope will be life-saving. As he took to his feet for the first time since after being struck down with a brain tumour, Ashya gave a wave to the camera and managed a slight grin. His father, who smiled broadly as he lovingly held his son under the arms as he attempted his first tentative steps, said it was great to see his condition improving. 'It really is amazing how much he has come on,' he told The Sunday Mirror. The youngster was later seen waving from his wheelchair as he left the Proton Therapy Centre following the end of his treatment on Friday. The Kings sparked an international manhunt when they took Ashya from Southampton General Hospital without seeking doctors' permission in August. They were traced to Spain where, at the request of the British authorities, they were put in prison and the five-year-old was held in hospital under armed guard with no family allowed to see him. Proud: Ashya's mother Naghmeh smiled as her son posed for pictures outside the Czech hospital unit on Friday . Care: Paramedics lifted the five-year-old into an ambulance ahead of the family's plan to travel to Spain . The Kings had planned to sell a holiday home in southern Spain to fund the pioneering treatment which they desperately wanted their son to have, but which was refused by the NHS in England. However, after a dramatic U-turn in events, they were eventually released from prison without charge and were able to continue their journey to Prague to the Proton Therapy Centre which agreed to treat Ashya. NHS England later reversed its decision and confirmed it had decided to pay for the treatment abroad afterall. Despite Ashya's treatment coming to an end in the Czech capital, Mr King said it was unlikely the family would return to Britain because they do not feel 'safe' enough. Fears: Mr King said they are worried the authorities will take Ashya from them if they return to the UK . Instead, they plan to continue Ashya's treatment in Spain. Mr King said: 'At the moment we don't feel 100 per cent safe contemplating being in England. 'There is so much still at stake. We wouldn't want to lose Ashya. It would probably never happen but just having that small risk that you don't have to do anything wrong to have your children taken away and be thrown in prison'. He added to Sky News: 'After some time we decided that perhaps it was best to return to Spain. We have a property there so life can be established quite easily for us. 'At the moment we don't feel 100 per cent safe, I suppose you would call it, contemplating being in England until perhaps they do this investigation into how everything was conducted for us. 'Once that has been established then we can think about going back to England. But for the time being we have been in contact with a doctor in Spain so we are continuing with (Ashya's) treatment in Spain instead of England.' Earlier this week, Iva Tatounova from the Proton Therapy Clinic told Sky News: 'We always thought Ashya would benefit from the specialist treatment here at the PTC. 'And whilst he is still not fully recovered, he's responded very well to the proton beam therapy and there is no reason that he will not continue to get stronger once he leaves here. Last treatment: Brett and Naghemeh King with Ashya, prior to his final round of proton beam therapy treatment . Happy: Ashya was filmed on an outing to the park in a touching family video posted online by his brother . 'I don't know if you remember the pictures when he was transported here - just lying on his bed in the ambulance. 'Now he can sit on his own, he can play with the toys and his motorics improved dramatically. He can also react to his surroundings.' The specialist treatment is a more targeted way of destroying cancerous cells than conventional radiation using photon beams, but NHS guidance does not recommend it as the best form of treatment. During Ashya's 30 visits to the centre, he had 13 treatments focusing on the brain and spine, to ensure the tumour he had removed has not spread, and the remaining 17 to irradiate where the brain tumour once was. He previously had major surgery to remove the brain tumour on July 24 and a further operation on his brain on August 22.

"The best match of this Wimbledon so far ended on Wednesday night with one of the protagonists on his knees, theatrically praying that a Hawkeye line call would save him. Czech veteran Radek Stepanek had wowed the Centre Court with his antics and rocked Novak Djokovic with the consistent quality of his old school tennis,  briefly threatening to provide the first dramatic upset of the 2014 edition. Yet just at the death, when it seemed we could be heading for a classic decider, the world number two reached inside himself to clinch a 6-4 6-3 6-7 7-6 victory with a rasping forehand that clipped the sideline. Roar of delight: Novak Djokovic celebrates winning a point against Radek Stepanek on day three at Wimbledon . Djokovic hits a forehand on Centre Court during his victory against Stepanek . Anxious wait: Stepanek watches a Hawkeye challenge on a big screen on Centre Court . Worth the wait: The Czech celebrates after Hawkeye awarded him the point over Djokovic . VIDEO Djokovic battles past Stepanek . The Centre Court rose as one to . acclaim the combatants, and the relief at the replay screen will have . been felt not just by Djokovic but also by his coach Boris Becker seated . up in his player box. Stepanek plays a wonderful brand of the sport, caressing the ball with . soft hands and delighting the public with an animated demeanour that . goes against the grain of stoic seriousness now so prevalent. His histrionics clearly riled Djokovic at certain points, and . contributed to a general unease which suggests that the Serb might be a . little more vulnerable this year after yet another Grand Slam final . setback at the French Open. Andy Murray, who went through in such contrasting fashion, . might have allowed himself to take note as he is due to have a repeat of . last year’s final a week tomorrow in the last four. The 35 year-old Czech, playing in his twelfth Championships, could so . easily have pushed this one the full distance. Having come back from 2-5 . down in the second tiebreak to 5-5 thanks to some uncharacteristic . wobbling from Djokovic he netted a straightforward volley that would . have given him a set point. Down but not out: The Serbian lies on his back after the end of another gruelling point . Guiding hand: Djokovic's mentor, Boris Becker, watches proceedings from the players' box . Don't try this at home: Djokovic displays his incredible athleticism to hit a forehand . All smiles: Djokovic's girlfriend, Jelena Ristic, looked impressed by her beau's efforts . While not entirely convincing the second seed is still not a man who . needs a second invitation, and he finished it on his first chance, . generously pointing to his opponent afterwards as they soaked up the . acclaim. It . was not the only time the 27 year-old from Belgrade had shown the better . side of his nature. In the eleventh game of the fourth set at deuce he . had sportingly conceded a point by admitting that an incorrect call had . not interfered with his shot that went out. The whole effect was  a reminder that it need not be a Murray command performance to bring the old arena to its feet. Afterwards Djokovic said: ‘I should not have complicated my life in this way, but credit to him, he’s an  entertainer and loves the big stage.’ The whole effect was a reminder that it need not be a Murray  command performance to bring the old arena to its feet. So far the big upsets of last year have not come, and the likes of Djokovic will feel more sure of  themselves as the slick new grass courts become harder and browner as the fortnight progresses. The Serb, who could have wrapped it up in straight sets, is relying . here on Becker with his long-term mentor Marian Vajda sitting back at . home, where he has pledged to spend more time. The reduced team will . have plenty to debate before his next outing, against Frenchman Gilles . Simon.

"For Heather Watson, the strain of bearing British hopes at Wimbledon manifests itself in strange ways. On Tuesday it was a case of lockjaw. Nerves meant the resurgent British No 1 was so uptight she was not just Sleepless in SW19, which is normal for her, but also incapable of opening her mouth ahead of her first round. Happily the anxiety evaporated once she walked on court to meet Croatia’s highly rated Ajla Tomljanovic, and she was able to avoid the possibility of a Tuesday wipeout for the host nation with an ultimately comfortable 6-3, 6-2 victory. Serene: Heather Watson eased into the second round with victory over Ajla Tomljanovic . Thumbs up: Watson salutes the crowd after her straight-sets win at Wimbledon . The overmatched Dan Smethurst and . Samantha Murray were never likely to register a tick on the credit . ledger for GB but the 22-year-old Channel Islander was burdened with . expectation, especially in the absence of Laura Robson. ‘I . was a bit nervous and struggled to eat before I went on, actually my . jaw was locking and I couldn’t even bite through my banana,’  said a . beaming Watson after her match. ‘It’s . just tension, I always get nervous but sometimes more than others and . that’s never happened before. I didn’t sleep that great last night, I . woke up at 4am, and I was ready to go. I did actually manage to get back . to sleep for a bit. The sleeping thing is normal, more since I have . been ill (with the glandular fever that helped wreck last season for . her). So it’s usually just that and struggling to eat.’ The . slump of 2013 means she has almost no points to defend between now and . the end of the year, so with the way she is playing there can be every . expectation that Watson will soon break back into the top 50. That . process would be accelerated if she could somehow defeat ninth seed . German Angelique  Kerber tomorrow. Watson’s mantra is that anyone can . beat anyone in women’s tennis right now, so that outcome is just about . possible. Next round here I come: Watson has been in fine form in recent weeks, and faces Kerber next . Fair game: Watson and Tomiljanovic shake hands at the end of the match . You know you will . get nothing less than wholehearted fight from the newly attacking . version of Watson, and that showed through in her ability to fend off . break points that her opponent, ranked eight places higher at 52, . created in the first set. That . extra edge is partly a product of her tennis upbringing being outside . the norm, having taken herself off to Nick Bollettieri’s tennis academy . in Florida at the age of 12. It is notable that the three British . survivors into the  second round have all largely done their own thing . in their development. Naomi Broady has long been an outsider from any . centralised system and Andy Murray has rarely ever been a part of it — . who knows, the Lawn Tennis Association might just discern a message in . there somewhere. The LTA did . provide financial support, it should be said, but after Watson helped . spare the organisation’s blushes by winning, she extolled the virtues of . branching out on her own. ‘I . couldn’t stay in Guernsey and when I went to visit Bollettieri I knew . it was the place for me,’ she said. ‘One of the reasons was that the . weather was very good and also it was so competitive. But the weather . plays a big part.’ Interestingly, . Watson revealed that she has never been asked by the powers that be . about why the Florida experience has been so beneficial. Tough: Maria Sharapova blew Samantha Murray away on Tuesday . 194: Marcel Granollers beat Nicolas Mahut in four sets over 194 minutes — the longest match. 7: Jelena Jankovic is highest seed to go out . 22: Victor Estrella Burgos’ Wimbledon debut lasted 22 minutes as he was forced to retire . 18: Serena Williams hopes to win an 18th Grand Slam . 71: Naomi Broady will earn £71,000 if she beats Caroline Wozniacki . 63: Venus Williams is playing in her 63rd Grand Slam event . 50: Feliciano Lopez is the fourth man in history to compete in 50 consecutive Grand Slams . 22: Agnieszka Radwanska has won her last 22 first-round matches at Grand Slams . One . trusts that this might happen with the arrival of veteran coaching guru . Bob Brett at the LTA as head of player development. A key appointment . of Canadian chief executive Michael Downey, the Australian speaks with a . velvet voice but wields a well- disguised iron fist. There could be no . complaining about the efforts put in by Samantha Murray and Smethurst, . two grafters whose struggles around the bleaker outposts of the circuit . were rewarded with the financial bonanza of the £27,000 minimum in . prize-money that comes with a wildcard. Not . only are there such luxuries as chauffeur-driven transport at events . like Wimbledon, their financial reward exceeds the total pot on offer at . some of the tournaments in which they play. The . closest Murray has ever got to Court No 1 has been purely as a fan, or . as a temporary employee of the All England Club seven years ago when she . worked in the office handing out accreditation badges. Now . she was out there against the unforgiving figure of tournament . second-favourite Maria Sharapova whom, after a few close early games, . she managed to detain for 58 minutes before succumbing 6-1, 6-0. Too big: Similarly, Daniel Smethurst couldn't quite match up to American John Isner . At . the start of May it was the proud boast of Smethurst, a 23-year-old . from Manchester, that he had won more professional matches in 2014 than . any other player, even if they came very much on the lower tiers. His . reward on his Grand Slam debut was to face the gargantuan serve of 6ft . 9in American No 1 John Isner,  something he described as ‘ridiculous, he . looks so casual it’s hard to tell what he is planning to do with it’. Smethurst . added: ‘I didn’t realise the crowd would get into it so much. I was . overwhelmed by that.  I’ve never had a crowd backing me like that . before. That was a great experience. Maybe I was a bit  too intense in . the first set, that’s something I need to learn in best of five . matches.’ He handled the . occasion well early on and created three break points at 3-3. The third . was saved with a 134mph ace which, as Nicolas Mahut — Isner’s opponent . in the 70-68 marathon in 2010 — could tell him, is just how it goes . sometimes. Watson could yet . be joined by another Brit in the second round after Tara Moore levelled . late in the evening to finish at 4-6, 7-6 against the beaten 2010 . finalist Vera Zvonareva. The . talented but under-achieving British No 6, faced with a player who has . won only one match this year due to persistent shoulder injuries, fought . back from 3-1 in the tiebreak to take it into a deciding set on Wednesday.","Heather Watson was in impressive form in reaching the second round .

"Hurricane Gonzalo which is tearing through the Atlantic will batter Britain this week bringing with it Gale Force 10 winds and heavy rain. The Met Office has issued a ‘yellow’ weather warning for most of the country for Tuesday as gale force winds of 55mph are expected to make driving conditions difficult and cause chaos for rush hour commuters. Experts are warning the worst of the hurricane will hit on Monday night with severe gales worst affecting northern parts of Ireland, Wales and England as well as Southern and Eastern Scotland.

Windsurfers made the most of the gusty conditions today in Broad Haven, Pembrokeshire as heavy rains lashed the south west of Wales . Forecaster Simon Partridge, from the Met Office, said: ‘This storm is what’s left of Hurricane Gonzalo. ‘It is going to reach the UK late Monday night and into Tuesday morning and bring some heavy rain with it. ‘It will be moving through quite quickly and is likely to clear most of the UK within six to eight hours. ‘There will be up to 20mm of rain, which is not out of the ordinary for the time of year, and up to 40mm in Scotland.

He continued: ‘The main reason for the warning is the timing, as strong winds will be coming through the Tuesday morning rush hour – it will be wet and windy and there will be spray on the roads. ‘Also the trees are still quite full of leaves at the moment and with those strong winds we could see a lot more leaves on the roads.’ Hurricane Gonzalo has been causing chaos over the weekend as it crushed trees and flattened power lines on the tiny Atlantic island chain of Bermuda.

"Facebook is treating their on-site bus drivers like 'servants,' according to a local workers union. The social media giant employs drivers to take their staff on shuttle-buses to their Silicon Valley HQ, but are accused of paying them so little they cannot afford to live in the area. The drivers are now hoping to unionize and join the local Teamsters enclave in order to force Facebook to cut a better deal with the contractor they work for. Unliked: A sign with the 'like' symbol stands in front of the Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California, where bus drivers are now trying to unionize for better working conditions . The bus drivers take Facebook's employees to the officers in Menlo Park, California, but are employed by a contractor, Loop Transportation. The local Teamsters union has written an open letter to chief executive Mark Zuckerberg on behalf of the drivers, accusing Facebook of behaving like the days of Downton Abbey. 'While your employees earn extraordinary wages and are able to live and enjoy life in some of the most exclusive neighborhoods in the Bay Area, these drivers can’t afford to support a family, send their children to school or, least of all, afford to even dream of buying a house anywhere near where they work,' Teamsters official, Rome Aloise said in the letter published by the New York Times. 'It is reminiscent of a time when noblemen were driven around in their coaches by their servants. 'Frankly, little has changed; except the noblemen are your employees, and the servants are the bus drivers who carry them back and forth each day.' The local Teamsters union has written an open letter to chief executive Mark Zuckerberg on behalf of the drivers, accusing Facebook of behaving like the days of Downton Abbey . Most of the drivers employed by Loop for Facebook earn $18-$20 per hour and work split shifts. This means starting at 6am to shuttle workers in to the Menlo Park offices until 11am, and then a six hour break until it is time to take the Facevook employees home again. The drivers complain that as they cannot afford to live in the area, their homes are too far away for them to go home on their break, and are hoping to negotiate new shift hours. Mr Aloise told the NY Times that he hopes to help the Facebook drivers first and then move on to broker similar deals with drivers working for Google, Apple and other Silicon Valley giants.","Facebook's bus drivers are being treated like 'servants' says union .

"Bastian Schweinsteiger believes hosts Brazil have been allowed to get away with 'hard tackling' at the World Cup so far - and has urged referees to be harsher in their punishment. Germany face Brazil in the semi-finals on Tuesday in Belo Horizonte and Schweinsteiger is keen for the referee to keep a close eye on Luis Felipe Scolari's side. The hosts committed 31 fouls during their 2-1 quarter-final victory over Colombia - who themselves offended 23 times - and Juan Zuniga's foul even ended Brazilian Neymar's World Cup by fracturing his vertebra. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Germany's Schweinsteiger discuss Brazil's change of style . Warning: Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger has urged referees to be wary of Brazil's 'hard tackling' Late: Brazil committed 31 fouls as they beat Colombia 2-1 in their World Cup quarter-final . Schweinsteiger said: 'I am all for a healthy hardness but some of Brazil's fouls were over the limit.' 'Brazilians are not only football magicians, hard tackling is part of their game - we have to be careful and so does the referee.' And the midfielder's views were echoed by Germany assistant coach Hansi Flick. He said: 'Brazil is an outstanding team that plays at the limit of the allowed and will go over the limit if necessary. '(Neymar's injury) It's definitely a loss for Brazil, Neymar has lived up to expectations, but his absence can unite the team more and we expect a very strong opponent,' Flick said. And Schweinsteiger said that although 'we are all very sad that Neymar is not playing', Brazil's squad will be even more tightly knit as they 'will try to win the title for Neymar'.

"Whether we are alone in the universe is one of life’s unanswered questions. But a new poll suggests that the majority of us are convinced aliens exist, and that we're more likely to believe in little green men than God. According to the research, children in particular are so confident in the existence of extraterrestrial beings that they think family members are aliens in disguise. Scroll down for video . Ripley’s Believe it or Not! London surveyed 2,000 adults and children. Ghosts topped the list on 55%, followed by aliens (a screengrab from 1982 film E.T is pictured) on 51%. Children believed in aliens and ghosts equally (64%), and more than quarter of the children asked said they believe some humans are aliens in disguise . The poll of 2,000 adults and children was carried out by Ripley’s Believe It or Not! attraction in London. Each of the participants were asked to rate how strongly they believed in five supernatural or religious beings including aliens, ghosts, UFOs, angels and God. Ghosts topped the adult’s list on 55 per cent, followed by aliens on 51 per cent and UFOs on 42 per cent. God was at the bottom of their list of beliefs on 25 per cent, behind angels on 27 per cent. Children believed in aliens and ghosts equally (64%), UFOs scored 50 per cent followed by God on 33 per cent. Angels were bottom of this group's list on 27 per cent. Top beliefs among adults: . Ghosts (55 per cent) Aliens (51 per cent) UFOs (42 per cent ) Angels (27 per cent) God (25 per cent) Top belief among children (aged 8 to 12): . Aliens (64 per cent) Ghosts (64 per cent) UFOs (50 per cent) God (33 per cent) Angels (27 per cent) *According to a poll of 1,500 British adults and 500 British children . Natascha Crump, General Manager for Ripley’s Believe It or Not! London said: ‘We live in the age of science and turn to it for most of our answers, but the results show that many of us still hold belief in things that might exist outside of our world and beyond our understanding. ‘It’s reassuring to have the answers for many of life’s questions but the average person will always be drawn to the odd, the unexpected and to the question ‘what if?’. ‘According to the results it’s clearly not just children who have an open mind when it comes to other life forms and keeping an open mind.’ The poll also found that more than a quarter of children (26 per cent) believe that aliens are disguised as humans - and one in twenty think their mother is an extra-terrestrial, although the most likely suspect is their brother. Almost half of the children admitted they think there is a stereotype associated with aliens with 43 per cent of children claiming aliens are most likely to be green. God was at the bottom of the adult's list of beliefs 25%, behind angels on 27%. Meanwhile, children were more likely to believe in God (33%) than angels (27%). UFOs (illustrated right) came third on both the adult and children's lists on 45% and 50% respectively . Adults were found to be more superstitious than children, with 26 per cent of them swearing by touching wood so as not to tempt fate, and refusing to ever walk underneath a ladder. Almost 15 per cent of adults said they were more scared of spiders (pictured), big dogs and heights than their children . But it’s not just children that have their suspicions – a third of adults polled said they have had a strange feeling about a certain building they have entered. One in five also admitted they have experienced a supernatural presence in their own home. Adults were found to be more superstitious than children, too, with 26 per cent of them swearing by touching wood so as not to tempt fate, and refusing to ever walk underneath a ladder. Almost 15 per cent of adults said they were more scared of ghosts than their children, and over half (53 per cent) said they try to hide their fear of things to prevent their children from feeling scared. This mainly referred to being scared of spiders (47 per cent) as well as big dogs (24 per cent), heights (23 per cent) and flying (13 per cent). Richard Dawkins recently told MailOnline he wants biologists to start to consider what other life might be like in the the likely event we discover we are not alone. 'The number of stars in current estimates is 10 to the power of 22, and it looks as though most of them have planets, so it's feasible to say the number of planets is in excess of 10 to the power of 22,' he said. 'It would seem to be rash to predict we're the only life form in the entire universe. 'On the other hand if there was only one planet that has life then it has to be this one, because here we are. 'The alternative is to say yes, we are alone. If you want to believe that then the origin of life on this planet has to be a quite staggeringly improbable event.' 'So we're left with the rather paradoxical result that people who are trying to work out how life originated on this planet are totally wasting their time, because the theory we're seeking is not a plausible theory, it's an exceedingly implausible theory.' Dawkins explained that if there is a plausible theory for the origin of life - one that has yet to be put forward - then there's going to be 'lots and lots' of life in the universe. 'I think there's lots of life in the universe, but that's just a hunch. It may still be very rare; it may be so rare that there are only a billion of them. 'If there are only a billion life forms then they will probably be so spaced out from each other that they'll never know each other and never come in contact. 'If they do come in contact, if we ever come in contact, it will almost certainly be by radio than by actually bodily meeting.","Ripley’s Believe It or Not!

"Evidence for a giant glacier that once existed in the deepest canyon on Mars has been found. A type of mineral 1.2 miles (2km) up the side of the canyon wall suggests that a huge glacier once passed through. While the idea of a glacier is controversial, the scientists say such a theory is the best explanation for their latest findings. Research led by Dr Selby Cull from Bryn Mawr College in Philadelphia suggests that part of Valles Marineris may have played host to an ancient glacier. Evidence comes from a mineral called jarosite found half way up the cliff wall (shown), which may have been the top of an ancient glacier that has long since disappeared . The research was led by Dr Selby Cull from the Department of Geology at Bryn Mawr College in Philadelphia. Evidence for the glacier comes in the form of the mineral jarosite being spotted in the wall, a sulphate that forms in highly acidic water with low temperatures - such as the top of a glacier on Mars. While evidence for glaciers on Mars has been spotted before, this is one of the first times evidence for one has been found in Valles Marineris. Named after the Mariner 9 Mars orbiter of 1971/1972, Valles Marineris is one of the largest systems of canyons in the solar system. At more than 2,500 miles (4,000 km) long, 120 miles (200 km) wide and up to x miles (7 km) deep it is among the largest canyon in the solar system. It is located on the Martian equator and stretches for a quarter of the planet’s circumference. If it was located on Earth it would stretch across the entire US. One of its largest sections is the Ius Chasma, which is about 938km long, in which this latest discovery was made. Several theories for its formation have been proposed, including water erosion and a tectonic ‘crack’ in the Martian crust. The canyon itself is thought to have been formed by tectonic stresses, but Dr Cull tells MailOnline the best explanation for the discovery of jarosite here is that a glacier once filled half the canyon. The jarosite was found in a thin layer 330ft (100 metres) along part of the cliff wall, suggesting it was once the boundary of the top of an ancient glacier. ‘The canyon wall starts at about zero metres elevation and descends to about -4,000 metres [2.5 miles],’ she explains. ‘We see the jarosite at -1,900 to -2,000 metres [1.18 to 1.24 miles], so about half-way down the canyon wall.’ She continued: ‘We found [jarosite] in a few places on Mars before, but the exciting thing here is we found it half way up a 3-mile [4.8km] high cliff face in the North Marineris. ‘All previous jarosite deposits have been found in low-lying deposit areas, places where water would cool.’ Jarosite usually forms in wet and acidic locations like rivers and groundwater, but Dr Cull explains that couldn’t have happened here. 'It would have required half the valley to be filled with water, which would have left huge indicators and evidence that there had been water there, and there’s no evidence,' she says. ‘So we think the only viable way you see jarosite is if there was a glacier.’ If true, this would be among the first mineralogical evidence for glaciers in the Ius Chasma - one of the largest portions of Valles Marineris. The mineral known as jarosite must have been desposited by highly acidic water at low temperature - and a glacier is the best explanation. Dr Cull says it could not have been a regular water flow such as a river as it would have had to fill half the deep canyon (Ius Chasma shown in image) The discovery was made using instruments on Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (left) and Esa's Mars Express (right) spacecraft. Further observations in future will be used to verify the findings . On average, Mars lies 141.6 million miles (227.9 million km) from the sun. With a diameter of 4,222 miles (6,795km), it’s around half the size of the Earth and has an average temperature of -65°C (-85°F). The gravity there is much weaker than on Earth - slightly less than 40 per cent of ours. The atmosphere is also desperately thin - one per cent of Earth’s pressure - and 95 per cent of it is carbon dioxide. It boasts the solar system’s biggest mountain – Olympus Mons, a dead volcano. This measures 335 miles (540 km) across and rises to a height of 88,000ft (26,800 metres), which is almost three times higher than Everest. Mars has two natural satellites - the moons Deimos and Phobos. The planet's red colouring comes from the iron oxide that coats its surface. Mars has huge amounts of ice at its polar caps. If they melted, the resulting liquid would cover the whole planet in water 36ft (11 metres) deep, according to Nasa. The team used data from two spacecraft, Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Esa's Mars Express, to make the findings. Dr Cull admits the theory that this canyon played host to a glacier remains controversial in the scientific community. But she says other explanations for this feature just don’t make sense. One possibility was that this jarosite came from a water table but, as it is not near the surface, Dr Cull says this would require the water table to be slanted, ‘which is a very strange thing for a water table to do.’ She continues: ‘If it was a glacier, it would be the top point of the glacier.' The mineral jarosite would form at the top of the glacier, where the ice melts, and be deposited on the cliff wall. One other theory is that this jarosite was deposited by an acid fog. Acid fog is essentially water vapour that is highly enriched in sulphur, which can be released during volcanic emissions. However, with no volcanic vents nearby, this theory looks unlikely. ‘We are continuing to map Ius Chasma, and will map the surrounding wall surfaces to see if we can find this same mineral elsewhere,’ Dr Cull adds. ‘It’s very exciting.’ Named after the Mariner 9 Mars orbiter of 1971/1972, Valles Marineris is one of the largest systems of canyons in the solar system. It is located on the Martian equator and stretches for a quarter of the planet’s circumference. This image of Valles Marineris was taken by Nasa's Viking orbiter in June 1992 .","Study suggests part of Mars' Valles Marineris had an ancient glacier .

"If, as expected, Patrice Evra completes a move to Juventus in the coming days, the new Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal will be greeted by a dressing room that looks and sounds rather different to the one that David Moyes left behind in April. In the blink of an eye, the make-up and personality of the United squad has radically transformed. Since the end of the season, United’s four most senior players – Ryan Giggs, Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra – have all moved on, although Giggs’ services have been retained in his new position as assistant manager. VIDEO Scroll down to see the changing face of Manchester United star Ryan Giggs . Man in charge: Ryan Giggs has been retained in his new position as assistant manager to Van Gaal .

Appearances: 300 (21 goals) Honours: 15 (5 Premier League, 3 League Cup, 5 Community Shield, 1 Champions League, 1 Club World Cup) Patrice Evra . Appearances: 379 (10 goals) Honours: 15 (5 Premier League, 3 League Cup, 5 Community Shield, 1 Champions League, 1 Club World Cup) From the playing staff, however, the club has lost the know-how and experience that comes with a combined 2,097 Manchester United appearances and a total of 80 winning medals between these four players. The figures are quite remarkable and while a new era dawns with the arrival of Van Gaal, it seems remiss of United to lose so much, so soon. The quartet have all captained United for extended stints, Ferdinand and Giggs together lifting the UEFA Champions League aloft in Moscow as the two shared responsibilities in 2008. Nemanja Vidic has twice captained United to Premier League glory. Ferdinand, Vidic and Evra have started in three European finals, forming the core of a back-line that broke records for consecutive clean sheets in 2009. And now, in an instant, it is all over. Surely it would have been more pragmatic to secure a balance between young legs and old heads. These players, who cared deeply for the United shirt, will be missed. United should have worked harder to retain one of Ferdinand and Vidic. Under Sir Alex Ferguson, these wise veterans brought a paternal touch to their task of buttressing the manager’s authority. They acted as model and mentor for the new signings and the academy products that nervously creep into the club’s Carrington training ground, offering guidance on the United way. Even last season under David Moyes, Adnan Januzaj leaned heavily on Ryan Giggs, Rio Ferdinand encouraged Chris Smalling to work on his distribution and Nemanja Vidic remained the captain that commanded the respect of his team-mates, even after he had declared his intention to leave in February. Glory, glory: Giggs and Sir Alex Ferguson celebrate their Premier League wins with Manchester United . Talisman: Giggs made 963 appearances for United and won 34 honours during his career . Injuries hampered the mobility of Ferdinand and Vidic but on the right occasion, they, along with Giggs, remained capable of outstanding performances in the showpiece matches. You need only watch the tape of Ferdinand and Vidic's flawless demonstration of organisation against Bayern Munich at Old Trafford in March to see that they remained the club's most accomplished defenders. Pace gave way to poise in the final years but the trio would deconstruct the game in their minds and anticipate the next act with masterly precision. Some performances were below par last season but regular observers of United note that these showings were no worse than the contributions of younger players, such as Smalling, Shinji Kagawa and Ashley Young. Tall, lean and athletic, there was once a feeling that Smalling could be a Ferdinand clone at Old Trafford. His form last season sadly rendered that suggestion the stuff of fantasy. Phil Jones, also, has a way to go if he is to fulfil Ferguson's prediction and become 'one of the best players we have ever had.' Young guns: Phil Jones must up his game as Sir Alex called him 'one of the best players we have ever had' Clone: Chris Smalling will try to emulate Ferdinand at Old Trafford but his form slipped last season . Chris Smalling . Appearances: 123 (5 goals) Honours: 3 (2 Premier League, 3 Community Shield) Phil Jones . Appearances: 104 (5 goals) Honours: 3 (1 Premier League, 2 Community Shield) Perhaps Smalling and Jones will be liberated by responsibility under Van Gaal, but there is also a reason that the Dutchman is close to signing Thomas Vermaelen and considering a move for Mats Hummels of Borussia Dortmund. The prominent endurance of Ferdinand, Vidic and Evra should have been guarded with more care. By way of retort, the club would argue that things have not transpired the way they intended. Vidic and Evra were not forced out of Old Trafford. Sources close to the dressing room suggest that Vidic had resolved to leave at the end of his contract as early as late September, determined for a fresh challenge following the exit of Sir Alex Ferguson. Ferdinand, meanwhile, had already made plans to move back down south with his family by the time that Van Gaal was in a position of decision-making power. Incoming: New United manager Van Gaal has lost experience but will make do with his young guns . Evra has now decided that the time is right for a move, aware that Luke Shaw will be the first-choice at left-back and conscious that his wife Sandra would like to live in Italy. Still, though, the Frenchman would have been a fountain of expertise for Shaw to tap into and his continued presence would lift some of the pressure off the 18-year-old's young shoulders. United will survive and move on, of course. Young talents like Januzaj, Shaw and James Wilson and Shaw will guarantee that. Pre-season will be a processions of hellos as Van Gaal bounds into town but United may come to reflect that they should have been a little less hasty to say some very emotional goodbyes.

"A shortage of cabin crew at Air India (AI) could endanger the lives of its passengers. The national carrier operates some of its flights with only one entry-exit point since the back door has been rendered useless by lack of staff. On Tuesday S.N. Jadhav, commander of Mumbai-Delhi flight AI 310, refused to fly the old Airbus 321 with only three hostesses on board, insisting on following Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) guidelines, which state that there must be at least five cabin crew in narrow-body domestic planes and both doors operational. DGCA rules state that there must be at least five cabin crew in narrow-body domestic planes . According to sources, many AI flights are operating with the back door shown as inoperative due to shortage of cabin crew. “By showing the back door of the aircraft as inoperative, we cannot use it even after it lands at the airport because it is sealed. In an emergency like crash-landing, there would be a near stampede with only one exit door. You have, at least, 200 passengers on board. It is very risky to fly with only one exit-entry door. Flying with one door as inoperative is not uncommon to us but it must be discouraged,” an AI crew member said. Staff shortage delayed as many as 16 flights for hours at Delhi airport on Monday, affecting 3,000 passengers. There was a shortage of 65 hostesses for 75 domestic flights and 38 for 16 international flights. Similarly, pilots for both domestic and international flights were short of the required strength as per the duty roster. There was chaos at the airport as many international passengers had to take connecting flights for the next leg of their journey. The situation more or less remained the same on Tuesday, airline sources told Mail Today. Some cabin crews alleged that the management is soft towards Mumbai-based crew as they have links with Shiv Sena and other political parties. Besides this the airline is facing a heavy rate of attrition, with 33 pilots quitting this year alone.","Back doors of some Air India aircraft are non-functional due to shortage of cabin crew .

"A Melbourne woman with a rare skin condition which makes her appear bright red has labelled Halloween costumes with facial disfigurements 'offensive'. Blogger Carly Findlay has urged Trick or Treaters not to wear 'scary face' costumes, such as Freddy Krueger and devil masks. 'I'd like to see scary face ruled out as a Halloween costume,' she wrote in an article, 'My Face Is Not A Halloween Costume', published on the website Blogher this month. Scroll down for video . Carly Findlay has ichthyosis, a rare skin condition which causes her skin to appear flushed and scaly . Ms Findlay is saddened that some children are frightened of her appearance . Ms Findlay has Ichthyosis, an incurable condition which affects some 10 to 20 people per million. It causes her skin to shed rapidly and she often appears flushed and scaly. Sometimes, children find her appearance frightening, hiding behind their parents' legs, which she said made her sad. 'I don't want to scare people,' she wrote, before pinning the blame on scary masks and frightening film and TV characters. 'I think that it's because they've not seen people with visible differences before,' she continued. 'But I also believe it's because they have seen masks and screen characters who are depicted as evil.' Talking to Daily Mail Australia, she singled out monster costumes as perpetuating negative stereotypes. 'They portray people who have facial differences in a really negative way,' she said on Thursday. 'You know, they’re villains, they’re scary, something to be feared.' Halloween decorations with scary faces are beginning to appear on homes throughout the world . Horror scene: Halloween is held on October 31, 2014 . Ms Findlay said characters in films who look different were 'never' cast as the hero, but 'always the villain'. Many others with the condition have encountered similar stigma, she said. 'A lot of people I know with my skin condition, they're asked whether they've put on make-up on Halloween. 'They can get quite offended.' 'In my Facebook feed, I’ve seen three or four parents say their (children have) been asked about their ""Halloween costume"".' The spooky festival has become increasingly popular in Australia in recent years. C for Carly: Ms Findlay has won awards for her writing on her blog, Tune Into Radio Carly . 'Dress up at Halloween,' Ms Findlay told Daily Mail Australia. 'But maybe consider doing it respectfully and creatively' Ms Findlay said keen trick or treaters should choose more creative and appropriate Halloween gear. For instance, by dressing up as athletes, scientists or positive role models. 'I mean, have fun,' Ms Findlay said. 'Dress up at Halloween.' 'But maybe consider doing it respectfully and creatively without offending someone's culture or appearance.' A popular blogger, Ms Findlay has become a vocal advocate for raising awareness with people with conditions that affect their appearance . Ms Findlay has been a vocal appearance diversity advocate in recent years. Last year, she was ridiculed in a cruel post in the 'WTF' forum on Reddit. But she fought back, penning a fiery riposte and finding hundreds of supporters. 'I knew the day would come that someone would create a Reddit thread about me, using my photo, having a laugh at my appearance,' she wrote. 'For years, that fear was why I didn't share photos of me online. But now, after gaining confidence and support through years of blogging, I couldn't care whether they call me a lobster or silly putty. 'The love I have around me and success I have had through telling my own story to break down stigma like these Reddit threads is stronger than any of those words. 'Yes I have Ichthyosis. Yes that picture is me. 'Don't fear it and don't criticise it. I am proud of the way I look, what I have achieved and for telling my story.' Her principal tormentor ultimately apologised and Ms Findlay was widely praised by punters online and in the media. 'The level of kindness shown in these situations is always greater than the level of hate,' Ms Findlay wrote. You can read Carly Findlay's piece about scary faces and Halloween on BlogHer.

Uruguay as they came out of their bunker of loathing, still accusing . everyone they could think of from FIFA to the English-speaking media of . persecuting their nice Senor Suarez. The question was whether they would . translate all that self-delusion into a singular act of vengeance. Yet, . Uruguay were pretty much on their best behaviour. Even as the boos and . jeers rained down on them from on high they concentrated on trying to . play their football. By and large they weren’t very good at it, but . players who had felt obliged to join their nation’s rallying behind the . Liverpool Lip seemed to understand the need for some kind of redemption. Thus it was uneventful until Rodriguez struck in the 28th minute, from . almost as many yards. He chested the ball down with back to goal, then . swivelled to complete one devastatingly elegant movement with a volley . which thundered down and in off the bar.

"Click here for all the stats and facts in our brilliant Match Zone, including this graphic of Mats Hummels' opening goal for Germany. Well, they did it again. It’s four on the trot now – a record. Germany have not missed a World Cup semi-final date this century: 2002, 2006, 2010, now 2014. It was 1998, in France, when they last failed to be in the competition in the final week, and they will be there again, in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday. And back here, in the Maracana Stadium, one last time a week on Sunday? There is no reason why not. Germany did not have the best chances, or necessarily play the best football, but they were excellent in possession, decisive and sharp at key defensive moments and found a way to win, as the best teams do. As Germany do, so often, in fact. That the goal came from Mats Hummels, a bold selection by coach Joachim Low who also abandoned his false nine system and restored Philipp Lahm to full-back, merely adds to the evidence that Germany are World Cup naturals in a way other countries – you know who – are not.

Referee: Nestor Pitana 7 (Argentina) *Match ratings by Joe Callaghan at the Maracana . France have a good record of going deep into the competition once beyond the first round, too. but they met their match here. Germany’s defensive shield was set up too efficiently to let them pass, despite the best efforts of Mathieu Valbuena, Antoine Griezmann and Karim Benzema. Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was exceptional, again, on what was his 50th international appearance. There was a lot of French pressure in the second-half, but the best chance still fell to Germany. When Mesut Ozil broke down the left flank, his cross sat perfectly for Thomas Muller, who should have claimed Germany’s second and took the last remaining tension from the game. Instead, he missed his kick and the ball fell to substitute Andre Schurrle who could not continue his run of five goals in consecutive internationals. Hugo Lloris saved with his feet. This was far from the most impressive German performance of this World Cup. Yet that, in its way, makes it all the more impressive. This is a team that cuts a path through, even in adversity; that came to Rio de Janeiro with seven players suffering a viral illness, yet didn’t even pack its big suitcases for the journey home, because it had no intention of departing early. Confident? Arrogant? Check the record. They have every reason to be both. There have been 13 World Cups since 1966 and Germany have made the last four in ten of them. England, the other finalists that year: one. It was an outcome that vindicated Low in so many ways. His changes worked, most particularly the reintroduction of Hummels for Per Mertesacker. Low worked out that France’s greatest threat came with pace and the ball over the top and that Mertesacker would be ill-equipped to deal with this. He was right. In addition, Hummels scored the only goal of the game and made a vital block. Tactically, it was a full house.

France had the best chances of the first-half, but Germany secured the all-important goal. That it came from a header and a set-piece is rather fitting. This was the most ordinary game of the knock-out rounds so far and, after the fireworks of the last 16, probably felt something of an anti-climax. Yet that is to deny Germany’s mastery of tournament football, of game management, of getting a nose in front and staying there. France have been lively in Brazil and even German hero Michael Ballack feared the worst. He said if his countrymen were not at their best would go out. He was wrong. Germany weren’t great, but it is France who are going home. Yes, it would be nice if every match could go off like a 4th of July parade – but there is enormous merit in what Germany did here, too. Hummel’s goal came in the 12th minute, from a straightforward free-kick that found France’s defence wanting. Toni Kroos whipped the ball in and Hummels got the better of Raphael Varane – so impressive until now – to head past the helpless Lloris. A reasonable penalty shout in the 25th minute aside – Mathieu Debuchy certainly appeared to pull Miroslav Klose’s shirt, but the fall was needlessly theatrical and did the case for the prosecution few favours – the best of the game belonged to France. Yet Germany’s ease in possession was to be admired, as was their measured game-plan and, once again, the performance of Neuer. He was talked of as Germany’s new sweeper after the match with Algeria, when he appeared to spend much of his time patrolling the outfield area behind the defensive high line, and that seems to be more deliberate ploy than happy accident.

Driving force: Blaise Matuidi (centre) attempts to burst between Bastian Schweinsteiger (left) and Jerome Boateng (right) High foot? The right boot of Howedes (right) almost catches diminutive midfielder Valbuena in the face . Low deserves credit for recognising that Neuer is as much footballer as goaltender and can allow Germany to play in a different way. Many years ago, Malcolm Allison said that the change in the backpass rule would make football evolve so that a goalkeeper would need to be as capable with his feet as any defender, but Neuer appears to be the first to truly support this. His skills were not required as much this time but he remained engaged and alive to the French danger. It also helps that when needed to perform conventional duties he is about the best around, too. A professional rush goalie? We could be seeing the first of a breed. Had Benzema found his range in the seventh minute, however, there is probably little Neuer could have done. Valbuena moved superbly to put in a cross for Benzema which the striker should have at least got on target. Germany’s defence does not offer up too many opportunities and it was not until the 34th minute that Neuer needed to fully demonstrate his talent.

On the attack: Marseille midfielder Valbuena (left) prepares to deliver a cross into the Germany box . Griezmann put in a cross which Valbuena met, forcing a stunning, one-handed save. The ball flew up and dropped for Benzema, but Germany’s massed ranks deflected it over. It was a similar story in the 42nd minute when a fine cross by Patrice Evra – who has looked a different player at this World Cup than he did for Manchester United for much of last season – picked out Benzema only for his header to be blocked by Hummels on its way to goal. Tuesday’s semi-final will be Low’s second as coach of Germany, and he was also assistant to Jurgen Klinsmann in 2006. He will be aware, though, that he is yet to reach the final itself. The thought of taking the big luggage to Belo Horizonte will not have occurred though? And as this World Cup approaches it peak with England long departed, you want to know what is funny? The way the Football Association talk about planning for the European Championships in 2016 as if they are the only ones who have thought of it. Germany do these things differently.

"Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler squirrelled away a massive fortune using cash he had 'earned' from his image rights and personal appearances as well as his refusal to pay £1.75 million in income tax. The Fuhrer even levied a royalty on German stamps featuring his image, with the cash hidden in his secret bank accounts. The mystery surrounds a secret will discovered by Herman Rothman, a German Jew who operated with British intelligence during the Second World War. Adolf Hitler, pictured charged fees for personal appearances and even received a royalty from his image being used on stamps . Mr Rothman, who is now in his 90s, has told on television for the first time how he discovered Hitler's secret will which left intriguing clues to his secret wealth. The former intelligence officer provided a fascinating insight to documentary makers behind Channel 5's The Hunt For Hitler's Missing Millions. After Hitler's suicide in his Berlin's bunker in 1945, Mr Rothman's Counter Intelligence Unit spotted a man dressed in civilian clothes they believed was an on-the-run Nazis. One of Mr Rothman's colleagues, who was a tailor in civilian life, spotted the unusual cut of the man's jacket - which contained a seven-page document containing Hitler's last will and testament. Free copies of his book, Mein Kampf, pictured, were given to newly-wed couples although Hitler received a royalty for each copy printed . According to Mr Rothman: 'We were absolutely shocked by what we found.' Mr Rothman was able to instantly translate the document, which was written shortly before Hitler shot himself on April 29, 1945. The first section was an rant against the Jews blaming them for starting the conflict. The second section was an attempt by the doomed dictator to hide the extent of his wealth. According to the documentary makers: 'What emerges is a picture of a smart property and art investor, a shrewd manager of cash with a love of money. 'Hitler’s actual tax records survive and suggest that he was a ""cash-in-hand"" businessman and a serial tax evader. He owed the German taxman a small fortune when he became supreme leader in 1933. 'Hitler had other ingenious ways of making money. The film reveals how he and his various businessadvisers and managers managed to copyright and sell his image rights and how he trained himself tomake public appearances and speeches, for which he took payment.' The documentary claims that Hitler was  shrewd investor who was able to hide his fortune which could be worth more than £1 billion in today's money . One contributor to the documentary said that relatives of Hitler could even claim a portion of those missing billions or earn a continuing wage from the Nazi's image rights. Another contributor Dr Cris Whetton tells the programme: 'He felt paying taxes was beneath him.' Dr Whetton, who has written a book on Hitler's finances, believes he was worth in the region of 1.1 billion Reichsmarks - a staggering £3.6 billion in today's money. Dr Whetton said much of Hitler's wealth was due to the state giving a free copy of his book Mein Kampf to couples on their wedding day, with a royalty being paid into the Fuhrer's personal coffers. Dr Whetton added: 'He loved money. He just wasn't prepared to pay for it.' * The Hunt For Hitler's Missing Millions.

"Click here for our brilliant Match Zone service including Arjen Robben's heat map... Maybe Louis van Gaal is the genius he often purports himself to be after all. Here at a rapturous Arena Fonte Nova, Van Gaal made one of the biggest calls of this World Cup and saw it take his team in to a semi-final with Argentina on Wednesday. Having seen his team pour all over Costa Rica for 120 minutes but fail to score, Van Gaal sent on Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul to face the penalties. Krul had barely had time warm up and the man he replaced,  Jasper Cillessen, had made a save in the 118th minute to keep his country in the competition. But Van Gaal is a coach who always seems to know what he is doing and Krul saved the second Costa Rica penalty from Fulham’s Bryan Ruiz, and then the fourth from Michael Umana, to take  Holland through.

Not once did he dive. Sneijder, . meanwhile, hit the frame of the goal twice - once in the 119th minute - . while Costa Rica goalkeeper Keylor Navas made a string of great saves. This . World Cup has another great story to add to the list and another great . game. This one had the right ending, though. This tournament has a . semi-final to savour. Van . Gaal’s team were superior in the first half, too. They dominated . possession and, with Sneijder perhaps playing his best football of the . World Cup to date, they created enough promising positions to have taken . a firm grip on the game. What . was missing was good decision-making and timing. All too often the . Dutch managed to break on the Costa Rica backline only to let themselves . down when it mattered. It was unlike them as, on the whole, they have shown a clinical edge in front of goal. Van . Persie was guilty early on. Having started the tournament so brightly . with his explosive  performance against Spain, the Manchester United . striker looked frustrated after failing to take an opportunity fashioned . beautifully by the industry of Dirk Kuyt and the vision of Memphis . Depay. Depay’s . pass found Van Persie with only the keeper to beat but he could not . manage it. The impressive Navas blocked to keep Costa Rica level. Navas also saved Sneijder’s follow up from the edge of the area and, later, was equal to a free-kick from the same player.

Gonzalez scores 2-2 . Sneijder scores 3-2 . Bolanos scores 3-3 . Kuyt scores 4-3 . Umana misses Krul saves . That apart, Navas did not have to excel but Holland really should have worked him more. An early run by Robben looked dangerous but was ended by a tackle from Giancarlo Gonzalez. Robben did not go to ground. The Bayern Munich player remained dangerous and whenever Holland advanced it was Robben who was at the heart of things. More than once he seemed about to make a decisive intervention only for things to break down or an offside flag to go up. Navas did make one more save of note in the first half, blocking from Depay. Costa . Rica seemed happy to wait for chances. They looked dangerous at . set-pieces and came close after the half-hour when Celso Borges headed . down a free-kick and an overhead kick from Johnny Acosta forced Van . Persie to hack clear.

Under pressure: Marco Urena makes a pass as Holland frontman Wesley Sneijder chases the ball down . One for the cameras: Costa Rica goalkeeper Keylor Navas stretches through the air to make a save . Costa Rican confidence was growing and who could blame them? Since the interval, Holland had threatened only sporadically. Van . Persie and Robben combined midway through the half but the . centre-forward’s return into Robben’s path was underhit and Costa Rica . cleared. Van . Persie was having a poor night. Van Gaal then brought on Jeremain Lens. He was offside when bringing a save from Navas before Sneijder smacked a . post with a free-kick. Van Persie then brought a low save from Navas. On both occasions, Costa Rica were fortunate to see the ball rebound to safety. Even . Van Persie could not be blamed deep in added time, when his far-post . shot from a Daley Blind cross rolled up Yeltsin Tejeda’s shin and on to . the bar. It . was an astonishing end to a 90-minute period that belonged to the . Dutch. Into extra time and Ron Vlaar saw a header saved then Acosta had . to hack clear from his own line. Nothing . they could do, it seemed, could save them from the ordeal of a penalty . shootout. And even then Costa Rica almost won it at the death, Marcos .

"Should Liverpool sell Luis Suarez to Barcelona? Barcelona are poised to formally open the bidding for Luis Suarez this week. Club intermediaries believe they already have an accord in principle with the player and his representatives but Barca must now match Liverpool's £80m valuation.

Thumbs up: Suarez thanks fans for their support in Uruguay... but will he be on the move to Barcelona soon? VIDEO Barca in for Suarez . Real Madrid maintain an interest in Suarez but they have opened preliminary talks with Monaco over a deal for Radamel Falcao. Liverpool are pressing ahead with deals for Southampton's Adam Lallana, Benfica's Lazar Markovic and Lille's Divock Origi. Although Tottenham have made a late move to sign the Belgian striker he is expected to sign for Liverpool for £9.8m. Liverpool are unperturbed by Real Madrid's interest with Raheem Sterling. The England international signed a long-term contract 18 months ago which incorporates annual increments. Moment of madness: Suarez denies that he deliberately bit Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini . Take a look: Chiellini shows off his apparent bite mark after his clash with Suarez . Pain game: Suarez was slapped with a four-month ban from all football, plus a nine-game international suspension over the alleged biting incident in Brazil . Former Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish, meanwhile, believes Liverpool should not wash their hands of Suarez in the wake of his latest biting controversy. Suarez, who was initially brought to Anfield in 2011 by Dalglish for £22.8m, has been banned from any football-related activity by FIFA for four months after he appeared to bite Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini in last week's World Cup Group D clash. Suarez finally apologised to Chiellini on Monday, with some, including Gary Lineker, insisting he was forced to say sorry by his agent to push forward a move to Barcelona. Although the ban has the potential to rule out last season's PFA and FWA player of the year for a significant chunk of Liverpool's 2014-15 campaign, Dalglish believes they will stick by their man. 'I think you will find that Liverpool will not turn their back on Suarez, whatever the ban FIFA have decided he must serve. Of course it will be a heavy blow if the club has to do without him for the opening months of the season,' he said in his Daily Mirror column. VIDEO Suarez in devastating form for Uruguay .

Bids: Belgium striker Origi is set to sign for Liverpool for £9.8m while the Reds remain keen on Markovic (R) 'That will seem harsh, particularly as he has been in someone else's care for the last few weeks and Liverpool have had no control over him.' It is the third time the 27-year-old has been involved in incidents of biting. While at Ajax, the Dutch FA banned him for seven matches for biting PSV Eindhoven midfielder Otman Bakkal and last April the FA gave him a 10-game suspension for nibbling on Branislav Ivanovic's arm. Real deal: Madrid like the look of Raheem Sterling, who was immediately back in the gym following his return from the World Cup with England . Liverpool stood by Suarez after the Ivanovic incident - just like they did after he was accused, and later found guilty, of racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra in 2011 during Dalglish's second spell managing the club. Dalglish, who came out strongly to defend Suarez in the press at the time, feels that when a club buys a player 'he becomes your responsibility'. The controversy has not deterred new Barcelona boss Luis Enrique, however, with the Catalan giants ready to tempt Liverpool with a big-money offer.

"‘Fred is coming off for Jo.’ It sounds more like two characters from Last of the Summer Wine than a Brazilian substitution in a heated World Cup quarter-final against Chile, when their future in the tournament is at stake. But the swap has been a move Luis Felipe Scolari has played twice. In the 68th minute against Mexico, Jo came on for Fred. In the 64th minute against Chile, Jo came on for Fred. They are hardly the most inspiring strikers to pull on the yellow shirt of Brazil, after decades – a century, even – of producing supernatural, superhuman, superstar goal-scorers. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Fred do a 'Suarez' on Marcelo during training . Dynamic duo? Strikers Fred (left) and Fred (right) have struggled for Brazil at the World Cup to date . Misfiring: Fred (left) has recorded a shot on target every 78 minutes despite starting all of Brazil's games . Down and out? Jo is goalless at the World Cup so far and has only completed eight out of 20 passes . What do you get from Fred? Well, one goal at this World Cup. Which was offside, and a header from two yards out. Also a shot on target every 78 minutes. That happens to be the total minutes Jo has played in the tournament in his two substitute appearances. He still hasn’t had a shot on target yet. Of his 20 passes – yes, a whole 20 – only eight have found their target. Neither play in Europe, Fred has had nine serious injuries since 2009 and Jo managed just six league goals in two years in English football at Manchester City and Everton. One-man team? Neymar has been the World Cup hosts' talisman having scored four goals in four games . They will surely go down as two of the poorest Brazilian strikers to have played for the country.This tournament, Neymar has been taking the brunt; not only has he had to carry the hopes of a nation on those slight shoulders, but that pair have been hitching a ride too. In total 27 forwards have been tried and tested by Dunga, Mano Menezes and Scolari since 2006 when a replacement for Ronaldo was required. Before then, there was a stream of great strikers. Ronaldo won two World Cups, in 2002 and 2006, and became the all-time World Cup tournament top scorer with 15 goals. Romario, who scored more than 1,000 goals in his career and 55 in 70 for Brazil, and Bebeto, 39 in 75 caps, won the 1994 USA World Cup together. Careca amassed 30 goals in 64 caps, winning the silver boot award at the 1986 Mexico tournament.And, of course, Pele, with his three World Cup wins, 77 goals in 92 internationals and 1281 goals in 1363 career appearances.

Ademir was top scorer in 1950 with seven – four in one game. Vava was top scorer in 1962, even though he was more of a target man, like Fred, alongside Pele who was playing in the role that Neymar has adopted now.

"He failed to score in his final three games of the World Cup, but that hasn't prevented Karim Benzema leading FIFA's official player index ahead of top scorer James Rodriguez and a host of other big names. The France striker couldn't stop his country crashing out of the tournament at the quarter-final stage as he had a last-minute effort well saved by Manuel Neuer in their 1-0 defeat by Germany at the Maracana. But Benzema is still ahead of the rest according to the Castrol Index, which uses FIFA tracking technology to capture data on each player. VIDEO Scroll down to watch James Rodriguez dancing during Colombia celebrations . Danger man: Karim Benzema celebrates scoring his first goal of the World Cup against Honduras . Surprise pick: The France star failed to score in his final three games but is still top of Castrol's player index . Game over: Benzema looks dejected after France's World Cup quarter-final defeat by Germany . That data is then analysed by a team of performance analysts, with every pass, tackle and move on the pitch measured and assessed to see if it has a positive or negative effect when it comes to scoring and conceding. Each player is then given a score out of 10 - with Benzema's impressive 9.79 total leaving him 0.05 ahead of Colombia hotshot Rodriguez in second. Real Madrid forward Benzema started the tournament in impressive style, scoring twice in his country's opening 3-0 win against Honduras before netting another goal in the 5-2 demolition of Switzerland. However his formed dipped as Didier Deschamps' side progressed to the knockout stages and he failed to score against Ecuador, Nigeria and Germany. In contrast, Rodriguez managed to score at least once in all of Colombia's games as they eventually went down to Brazil in the last eight. The Monaco forward finished with six goals in five appearances and was the inspiration behind Jose Pekerman's side gliding into the quarter-finals with four consecutive victories. Driving force: Colombia's James Rodriguez scored six goals for his side but only makes No 2 in the index . Final impact: Rodriguez scores from the penalty spot in Colombia 2-1 quarter-final defeat to Brazil . France defender Raphael Varane surprisingly makes up the top three with a score of 9.7, despite being at fault for Mats Hummels' winning header for Germany. The 20-year-old is joined by fellow defenders Thiago Silva (9.66) and Hummels (9.63) in the top five, with both players having scored vital goals to help their respective sides reach the last four.

"Nine batsmen with at least one Test century were packed into England’s Trent Bridge team but they could not prevent a quite pathetic collapse on Friday that exposed the depths to which a side bereft of all confidence have plummeted. A middle session as bad as any in England’s miserable last nine months saw six wickets fall on a first Test pitch that remained a lifeless strip of dirt that any self-respecting batsman would want to dig up and carry around with them. Only a late rally from Stuart Broad and then Joe Root saved England from total humiliation but they have much to do if they are to leave one of their most productive grounds still level in a series Alastair Cook cannot afford to lose. VIDEO Scroll down for England's Joe Root looks back on day three at Trent Bridge . Sharma the charmer: India seamer Ishant Sharma celebrates a wicket as he tears through the middle order . Shining light: Joe Root built an innings while most of his team-mates fell around him . Innovative: Root plays a reverse sweep off the spin of Ravindra Jadeja . Holding it together: Root acknowledges the Trent Bridge crowd as he leaves the field on 78 not out . There was little sign of what was to come as Gary Ballance and Sam Robson moved methodically forward while India’s bowlers toiled just as fruitlessly as England’s had done, particularly when they could not separate the last pair. Yet, from the soporific strength of 134 for one and what seemed a certain draw, suddenly and shamefully England fell apart against an Indian team who have not won a single Test away from home in more than three years. Yes, Matt Prior was the victim of a quite appalling piece of umpiring from Kumar Dharmasena, supposedly the ICC’s finest, and Robson may have been unlucky to be given out lbw in this Decision Review System-free Investec series. And, yes, India’s bowlers have much more experience of the sort of sub-continental conditions gifted to them here in Nottingham rather than the alien ones they are usually confronted with outside their own country. But an England team who have simply forgotten how to win have no excuses for failing to cope with an attack that, like Sri Lanka’s before them, should not pose the problems that Australia’s did during the horror winter. There were no demons in this pitch and . there should not have been anything to fear in a bowling line-up . consisting of three seamers only just the right side of medium pace, a . trundler and India’s second choice spinner. Yet . as soon as India managed to get an out of shape ball changed just after . Robson appeared to get an inside edge onto pad when given lbw the whole . complexion of the match and possibly the series dramatically changed. Five more wickets crashed in an afternoon . session where England lost six in all while scoring 74 runs after . compiling 88 without loss during the morning. It was awful stuff that . seemed to stun the usually supportive Trent Bridge crowd. Short stay: Ben Stokes lasted just two balls after having a nibble at one and being caught behind . Controversial: Matt Prior (right) was given out caught behind despite the bat being nowhere near the ball . The keys to a stunning transformation were the replacement ball that swung much more than the original one and the sudden unexpected burst into life of the erratic but sometimes brilliant Ishant Sharma. When Ishant is bad he is terrible but when he gets it right he can be a formidable proposition and here he began the collapse with a spell of three wickets that ripped the heart out of this vulnerable and fragile England side. It was Ishant who had trapped Robson, . with the help of what looked like a mistake by Bruce Oxenford, and he . followed it up by ensuring that Ballance was denied a century and Ian . Bell was once again cut off in his prime. Safe hands: Shikhar Dhawan (right) takes a catch to dismiss Moeen Ali (below) after the ball hit his glove . Not showing him much glove: Moeen Ali is hit on the hand by a short ball and caught in the slips . Neither here nor there: Ian Bell tries to pull his bat out of the way but nicks a delivery from Sharma . Jubilation: Sharma is elated after taking the prized wicket of Bell . Bell must be considered culpable in England’s demise. It was his strangled dismissal at Headingley that sparked Sri Lanka into life and now he found a way of getting out just when he seemed poised for a big and vital contribution. England desperately need their senior players to stand up and be counted while the many promising newcomers adapt to their surroundings yet Bell fell just as disappointingly as his captain had on Thursday when he tried to withdraw his bat and got the faintest of edges through to MS Dhoni. Worse, much worse, was to come for England as India warmed to their task, pitched the ball up to batsmen who prefer the back foot and used the short ball sparingly and hugely effectively, notably when Moeen Ali gloved to slip. Oh no! Ballance cannot believe it as he is dismissed for 71 . You've got to go: Sam Robson (left) looks aghast as Sharma celebrates taking the first wicket of the day . Halfway there: Ballance raises his bat to salute reaching 50 . Prior was the man who would either come to the rescue or take the game away from opponents during England’s glory years but he was denied the chance to do so here by an unforgivable error by umpire Dharmasena. Dhoni, who captained his side brilliantly, stood up to Bhuvneshwar Kumar and appealed loudly when a noise accompanied Prior’s play and miss to earn the decision from Dharmasena. Yet Prior's bat was fully six inches away from the ball and the sound was him clipping his pad. It is India who arrogantly refuse to use the DRS and it cost them on the second day when Murali Vijay was wrongly given lbw by Oxenford. Yet now it was to favour them outrageously as Dharmasena raised his finger and seriously weaken the arguments of those of us who regret the advance of technology in officiating. There was no doubt that Ben Stokes . touched it two balls later – Dhoni was by now standing back again – and . from nowhere England were 202 for seven and in serious danger of being . asked to follow on by a rampaging India. That . they avoided that possibility was down to a bristling Broad, who hit 47 . off 42 balls, and then the second productive last wicket partnership of . the match that stands at an unbroken 54 even though Jimmy Anderson was . struck a nasty blow on his hand. Root, . who started tentatively but grew into the challenge, remains on 78 and . is the only one of England’s nine Test centurions who can be absolved of . blame. Yet England are . still 105 behind and it now looks certain that this will be their ninth . successive Test without a win. And that is an unacceptable sequence.

The former Southampton starlet has signed a four-year contract with an option to extend for a further year and revealed his delight at joining the 13-time Premier League champions. The Saints will receive £27million up front rising to the full figure. He said: 'I am thrilled and excited to be joining Manchester United. I have been at Southampton since I was eight years old and I would like to thank them and the fans for everything they have done for me. 'I want to continue to progress my career and joining United is the ideal place for me to do that. 'I am looking forward to this new chapter in my life and also looking forward to learning from the world-class players and management at the club.' With Van Gaal taking charge of Holland's World Cup campaign, his No 2 club legend Ryan Giggs earmarked the new signing for success at United. 'Luke is a very talented young left-back with great potential. He has developed immensely during his time at Southampton and has all the attributes to become a top player,' said Giggs. Return: Luke Shaw is back from representing England in his debut at the World Cup in Brazil . Race: Shaw was at Carrington for a medical and is expected to be unveiled on Friday . Move: Southampton left-back Shaw is set to become the most expensive teenager in history . 2012-2014: Southampton (60 apps) 2014-NOW: England (3 caps) 'I am delighted he has joined . Manchester United as I believe this is the right club for him to . continue his development as a young player and eventually fulfil that . promise.' Shaw's former club Southampton insisted they will use the money from the transfer to rebuild their squad. Executive director Les Reed said: 'While we are sad to see Luke depart the club, we fought to ensure that we got the right deal for a player in whom we have invested a great deal of work over the past decade. 'Luke joined us at the age of eight, and our academy staff and coaches have helped him to progress into a top-class player. He will leave our club and carry forward our top-class pedigree, as others have done before. 'This deal is a good one for Southampton Football Club, and hopefully sends a clear message to other clubs wishing to bid for our players. Former: Shaw (right) is set to leave Adam Lallana (left) at Southampton for Manchester United . Green light: Louis van Gaal has given his blessing for the deal to go ahead to bring in Luke Shaw . 'Luke’s transfer fee will be . reinvested into the team as our new manager, Ronald Koeman, builds for . the new season and for years to come.' Sportsmail revealed on Thursday . that the England international met United officials at the club's . training ground, where he was given a personal tour ahead of his medical . on Friday morning. He will then head . away on holiday before returning to meet his new team-mates for . pre-season. Sportsmail understands that his holiday plans have been . scheduled to ensure that he is back in time for United’s pre-season of . the United States in July. Shaw . is understood to have informed Southampton of his desire to leave the . club at the end of May and a wage package in excess of £100,000 has been . agreed in principle between United and the player for some time. Former Old Trafford boss David Moyes did some of the groundwork in persuading Shaw to make the move, as United overcame interest from Chelsea to secure their man with a salary that blew the London club out of the water. Shaw thing: The England left-back leaves Southampton to join Manchester United . It is understood that new boss Van . Gaal has given his blessing for the deal to go ahead. The Dutchman has . been in regular contact with executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward and he . is understood to be delighted with the progress the club have made in . the transfer market. United cooled their interest in recent weeks to ensure that Shaw was fully focused on his involvement at the World Cup but as Sportsmail revealed on Monday morning, Ed Woodward intended to accelerate the pursuit once England returned from Brazil on Wednesday afternoon. Shaw disembarked at Luton airport to see his family before heading up to the North-West to become Van Gaal's second signing, after Ander Herrera completed his transfer to the club on Thursday. Fee: Shaw's price is somewhat higher than United had hoped for but they are prepared to fork out the sum . Thanks: Shaw throws a boot into the crowd after England drew 0-0 with Costa Rica at the World Cup . Sportsmail also understands that assistant . manager Ryan Giggs has returned from St Georges Park to welcome Shaw, . where he was undergoing his practical assessment for the Pro License . coaching course on Thursday afternoon. In the absence of Van Gaal and Giggs, Sir Bobby Charlton greeted Herrera at Carrington. The fee for Shaw is somewhat higher than United may have initially hoped for, with Southampton's resistance increasing following Shaw's involvement in the World Cup and the arrival of Dutch manager Ronald Koeman, who has sanctioned the sale. United were initially confident of securing a £27.5m swoop but Southampton have managed to push the overall fee beyond the £30m mark. Shaw becomes the most expensive teenager in world football and he is the second most expensive signing in United's history, behind January recruit Juan Mata, who arrived for a £37m fee from Chelsea. Shaw and Herrera are yet to be allocated squad numbers by United and it is believed that the club are waiting to offload a few players before allowing the two new signings to choose.

"Fabio Borini is the subject of an £8million bid from Sunderland as they attempt to lure back last season’s loan star to Wearside. The Liverpool striker spent the entirety of the last campaign at the Stadium of Light and became a favourite after netting crucial goals in their fight against Premier League relegation. Gus Poyet’s side eventually steered their way clear of danger, thanks in part to the Italian’s contribution up front alongside Connor Wickham.

Revolving door: Liverpool have seen plenty of new arrivals and Borini could see chances limited . And they want the 23-year-old to spearhead their attack when the new term starts next month.

"If Roger Federer truly is past it, then Milos Raonic must have felt like he stepped into a time machine and travelled back a few years last night. By the end of the first game, the 23-year-old had already seen his huge serve broken. By the end of the second set he looked like a broken man. Thirty-three minutes later he was out of the gentleman’s singles, the uprising of youth obliterated by one of the oldest swingers in town. What happens next, in a Wimbledon final against Novak Djokovic, remains to be seen for a man one month shy of his 33rd birthday. What can be in no doubt is that those directing Federer towards pasture will need to take a break. Perhaps they need a lie down. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's day 11 verdict with Stuart Fraser and Mike Dickson . Through: Roger Federer (left) is through to the Wimbledon final after a straight sets win against Milos Raonic . Big-hitter: Raonic struggled to cope with Federer's class once his serve had been returned . How romantic that after two years . without a Grand Slam - some of it spent in an undignified, unrequested . position of pity - Federer finds himself on the cusp of becoming the . oldest male winner of Wimbledon in the open era. A record eighth title . here, a notion that seemed increasingly implausible this time a year . ago, is now one match away. ‘I'm . unbelievably thrilled to be in another final,’ he said. ‘I was very . pleased the way I played because it was always going to be a difficult . match against Milos. ‘The . fun for me is being able to do it, at this age, with a family, with the . team I have. We have a great relationship. I know so many people over . time now on the tour, so being here, doing this, is something I really, . really enjoy. ‘I . am extremely happy. I will try to enjoy it as much as I can. The first . final was special in 2003 and it has been a thrill ever since. To get . another chance is great. Novak and I have had many great matches.’ If . his win yesterday, and indeed his wider revival in 2014, proved . anything it is that while the old back might not be what it once was, . the maestro with four children in tow can still play a handy tune. Record: Federer admitted winning Wimbledon for an eighth time would top his career achievements . Down low: Raonic attempts to return to Federer during the pair's semi-final clash . Star: British actor Jude Law (centre) was in the Royal box to enjoy the men's semi-finals on Friday . Of . course, the obituaries were premature in the extreme and, by extension, . a measure of context is needed when rating the scale of his comeback . this year. By . his own admission, 2013 was ‘difficult’; woeful in the minds of most . who saw some of the defeats. He had a serious back injury and his lowest . haul of titles since 2001 – one. His ranking fell to eighth. Worse . still, in the two years since he won here there has been a spreading of . the opinion that the mounting losses would damage his legacy. A . ludicrous sentiment but a popular one. ‘I don't even remember when my last Grand Slam final was,’ Federer joked last night. Certainly, . this is no fairytale. He has been too good for too long to count as a . true outsider, particular with grass under his feet. But it is an . astonishing achievement and one given greater stature by the numbers . that show only eight Slams have been won by fathers since 1990. None . have been won in that time by a father of four. Victory: Federer waves to fans and  acknowledges their support on Centre Court . Respect: The pair shake hands following Federer's semi-final victory on Friday evening . Down: Raonic takes a tumble during the semi-final defeat out on Centre Court . Then again, Federer is the man who has made an estimated fortune of £140million by breaking records. Yesterday . he took a step to more by breaking serves. This was a win that owed . much to experience and a keen sense for when Raonic was vulnerable. At . the slightest sign of weakness, Federer ran away with the game. His . three breaks of serve – twice to 15 points and once to 30 – were notable . against a man broken only twice in five previous matches. The . first break came in the opening game. Raonic walked with his head down . to the chair, picking at his strings; Federer strutted, brushing back . his hair, calmness personified. He never looked back in taking the . opening set 6-4 in 34 minutes. At . that point, there were no smiles, unlike Thursday when he traded . high-fives with some of the hundreds who watched him practice on Court . 4. There was simply that single fist salute so familiar to those who saw . him dominate this competition for a decade. There was another when he broke at 4-4 in the second and at the same stage in the third. Raonic, close to the front of the ‘new wave’ of men’s tennis, was left shaking his head. ‘Roger . is the guy that's done a lot of things that don't seem possible,’ he . said. ‘A lot of people could have, and have, written him off in a lot of . ways. But you knew he was capable of this run.’ It’s not over yet.","Roger Federer through to Wimbledon 2014 final after straight sets win against Milos Raonic .

"Sorry to come over all nostalgic while a football carnival is unfolding in Brazil and the world’s grandest  tennis tournament is taking place, but what choice have we British sports enthusiasts got? This pining for better times is not just brought about by poor Andy Murray’s tennis yesterday being as flat as his vowels. It is the result of failure after failure from our national sportsmen this year: our rugby players whitewashed in New Zealand, our cricketers losing a series at home to Sri Lanka for the first time and our footballers going out of the World Cup before the BBC had even got Alan Hansen out there. Down and out: Andy Murray is the latest from our shores to have lost on the biggest stage recently . It's over: The defending Wimbledon champion was beaten in straight sets 6-1, 7-6 (7-4), 6-2 by Grigor Dimitrov . We must hold judgment on this — the Tour de France, The Open, the Commonwealth Games await us — but we are in grave danger of seeing 2014 turning into an anti-2012. Ah, those blissful seven months between the late-spring and mid-winter of 2012. The conventions of lifetimes watching  British sport were inverted. Our heroes were not gallant losers, but imperious winners. At the centre of it all was the London Olympics, arguably the best thing we have accomplished as a country since winning the Second World War. We lit up the flame and we lit up the world, as Lord Coe told the Closing Ceremony. Across sport, fairytales were turning true. No British man had won a Grand Slam tournament for 76 years until Murray clinched the US Open title that year. Knocked out early: England didn't manage to get through their tough group at this summer's World Cup . VIDEO Rooney apologises to fans . That didn't go to plan! England's Test team lost the first series of this summer against tourists Sri Lanka . VIDEO Broad back captain Cook . And as for the Ryder Cup, here is the verdict of American sports writer Gene Wojciechowski after Europe finished the penultimate day 10-6 down. ‘For those who think this Ryder Cup is finished, think again,’ he mused. ‘Team Europe can still win if the following five things happen Sunday: . 1. Keegan Bradley is abducted. 2. Team USA captain Davis Love III inserts Cup spectators Michael Jordan, President George W Bush, Amy Mickelson and the Rev Jesse Jackson into the singles line-up. 3. Lee Westwood: US citizen. 4. Marty McFly shows Team Europe captain Jose Maria Olazabal how to go back in time. Last Friday morning will do. 5. Team Europe wins eight of the remaining 12 matches to retain the Cup.’ Nice one Gene, old buddy, but Martin Kaymer holed from five feet to clinch victory 14½-13½. Where did the time go? Martin Kaymer holed from five feet to clinch Ryder Cup victory two years ago . The Tour de France had always been as Gallic as brie and baguettes. As Des Robinson, brother of Brian Robinson, the first Briton to win a stage of the great race, once said: ‘If you can imagine a Frenchman scoring a century at Lord’s, then you can imagine an Englishman winning a stage of the Tour de France.’ Yet, in 2012, Bradley Wiggins won the whole Tour. Our relationship with the bicycle changed dramatically at that moment. The year 2012 even saw Manchester City win the championship of England. It’s no big deal nowadays, but it was then: they had not achieved the feat in 44 seasons. It was dramatic, too, Sergio Aguero scoring the late winner against QPR. As for cricket, we hailed the qualities of Alastair Cook on dusty Indian pitches. Cook scored three tons, taking him to 23 Test centuries — the most by any Englishman. It beat the record set by Wally Hammond 73 years earlier. Cook brings us back, unhappily, to today. Cook is a fabulous batsman of conspicuous gumption (form is temporary etc) but a ludicrously negative captain. A new era: Alastair Cook opted to blood youngsters Sam Robson (left) and Gary Ballance against Sri Lanka . Losing the series to Sri Lanka can be attributed to his decision not to declare, say, 45 minutes before the close of the fourth day of the First Test. Instead he allowed Gary Ballance to score a maiden hundred and declared overnight. Sir Lanka were nine wickets down by the dismal, avoidable conclusion. It is my theory that there are too many ‘support staff’ around modern sportsmen for them to think for themselves. So England had an 80-strong party at football’s World Cup, yet America went further in the tournament. What about Steve Peters, the mind doctor who is credited with having helped British Cycling and Liverpool? He was brought in to prepare England’s footballers. Fat lot of good that did. And let’s not forget that one of his charges was Luis Suarez, the not-so-reformed cannibal  of football. If good people think Peters is worthwhile — and Steven Gerrard, Sir Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton are among his supporters — that is an outstanding statement on his work. Nevertheless, these huge retinues seem to be bloated products of over-funding, the bastard brother of the Lottery era, which said loads of money and lots of people were the answer to everything. It is the downside of what was an upside. Even nostalgia, it seems, is not what it was. The real deal? Steve Peters is a consultant psychiatrist with Liverpool and went to the World Cup . Chijindu Ujah became the third-quickest British 100m sprinter of all-time when he ran 9.96secs in Holland. The men’s four — Andrew Triggs-Hodge, George Nash, Mohamed Sbihi and Alex Gregory — and the women’s pair of Helen Glover and Polly Swann won European rowing gold in Belgrade. Justin Rose  won last weekend on the US PGA Tour at Congressional. Double Paralympic champion Hannah Cockroft broke her T34 world 100m and 200m records and set a world 1500m best. Paul Drinkhall became the first British table tennis player to win a world tour singles event for 18 years when he took gold at the Spanish Open in April. Katarina Johnson-Thompson won the prestigious heptathlon in Gotzis, Austria — which doubles as a mini-world championship — with a personal best of 6,682 points, the best tally in the world this year. England women’s football team have reeled off eight straight wins in their bid to qualify for the 2015 World Cup, to be held in Canada next June.

"Jailed for life: Gareth Jones, 28, battered folk guitarist David Lewis to death with a rock and a beer bottle for just £50 . A killer who battered a 'quiet and gentle' singer to death for £50 just days after being released from prison has been jailed for life. Gareth Jones, 28, befriended folk guitarist David Lewis with the intention of stealing his bank card. The pair met at the Huggard Centre for the homeless in Cardiff and Jones later accompanied Mr Lewis to an ATM machine where he attempted to make a mental note of his PIN. He then led his victim to a 'desolate river bank' where he savagely attacked him with a rock and beer bottle inflicting more than 100 injuries. A court heard how Jones took £50 from Mr Lewis's wallet and then tried to use his bank card but twice got the number wrong. Jones was arrested after Mr Lewis's body was found in the River Taff in Cardiff on March 19. The murderer had been released from prison just five days earlier - where he had been serving a six year sentence for stabbing his girlfriend in the head with a fork. When he left jail, Jones was homeless and quickly drifted back into his lifestyle of drugs and crime. He was found guilty of murder and sentenced in his absence at Cardiff Crown Court today - and must serve a minimum of 20 years behind bars. Judge Nicola Davies told him: 'You attacked David Lewis using a rock and broken bottle, you also attempted to strangle him. 'He suffered 80 blunt and sharp injuries to his head and face, another 20 were inflicted to his neck . 'You then twice tried to use Mr Lewis's PIN number to obtain £20. Your attempts failed as an incorrect pin number was used. 'It was no doubt your intention to identify the PIN number when you stood next to Mr Lewis as he took money from the cashpoint that evening. 'Quiet and gentle': Victim David Lewis suffered more than 100 injuries in the attack by the River Taff in Cardiff . Prosecution counsel Vincent Coughlin said Jones picked out Mr Lewis as easy prey and said it was a 'calculated killing'. Mr Coughlin said CCTV showed the defendant walking away afterwards as if 'nothing had happened'. He returned to a different hostel and boasted of what he had done but his claims were not believed. Following the killing, the court heard how Jones had thrown away his bloodstained clothing before feigning illness and being taken to hospital. The killer has been on remand at Liverpool's maximum security psychiatric hospital Ashworth since the incident. Devastated: Mr Lewis's heartbroken parents speak outside Cardiff Crown Court following today's sentencing . Jones had pleaded guilty to manslaughter but denied murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility. But after more than five hours of deliberations a jury delivered a unanimous guilty verdict, finding the killing was intentional. Sentencing him, Judge Davies concluded: 'This was a calculated and premeditated murder for gain.' After the case Mr Lewis's heartbroken father Glyn, of Ystrad Mynach, South Wales, said: 'We are still shocked to the core - his death has left a huge hole in our lives. 'But we are satisfied with the outcome of the trial and the jury's verdict..' Scene of the crime: Jones led Mr Lewis to this 'desolate river bank' where he killed him and stole his wallet . Detective Chief Inspector Kath Pritchard, of South Wales Police, said Mr Lewis' murder was a 'particularly tragic incident which left people extremely shocked' He also thanked a witness who went to police to tell them about their son's 'tragic situation' on the day he was killed. Detective Chief Inspector Kath Pritchard, of South Wales Police, also spoke. She said Mr Lewis' murder was a 'particularly tragic incident which left people extremely shocked'. She said: 'We are truly grateful for all those who came forward with information.' She added that she hoped Jones's conviction would 'reassure the public' that those who prey on the vulnerable will be caught.","Gareth Jones, 28, met musician David Lewis at a Cardiff homeless shelter .

"Lionel Messi looked exhausted as the clock ticked into the 117th minute in Sao Paulo before he suddenly shifted up a gear to provide Angel Di Maria with a chance on a plate to win the game for Argentina. The diminutive number 10 looked frustrated for long periods: left to win the game on his own, heavily marked and being constantly fouled - but when he finally got going he once again lit up the World Cup by setting up the winner with less than three minutes to go of extra time.

It has the goalkeeper worried but just goes over the bar. 74 minutes: Working his way into the box on the left, Messi drifts in a cross but it is headed wide. 77 minutes: Messi finally gets a real effort in at goal.

He is now so key to Argentina's play . that he was his side's top tackler - with six - alongside right back Pablo Zabaleta. And Messi was, of course, constantly at the heart of everything Argentina did well offensively - although there wasn't much of that in a poor game in Sao Paulo. Throughout the first half the Swiss were brilliant in their attempts to frustrate the little maestro, springing as many as four markers on him when needed as they nullified the threat of Argentina's talisman. He briefly sparked into life midway through the half but the excellent Ricardo Rodriguez recovered to nick the ball from his toes. It looked to be a frustrating afternoon for the man who had scored in all three of his games at this summer's tournament before facing Switzerland, with Argentina often forced to go wide and aim crosses into the box - obviously not Messi's strength. But as the game ebbed on at 0-0, Messi began to have more and more influence, dropping deep to pick up the ball between the lines of Swiss defence and midfield. In turn, his opponents changed their approach, with Granik Xhaka and Fabian Schar among the chief culprits repeatedly fouling the Argentine and preventing him from running at the defence. But these are tactics Messi is used to, both at club level and particularly at this World Cup. Teams crowd him but he tends to find a way through. Against Bosnia and Nigeria he scored relatively early - but in the 1-0 win over Iran his winner came in stoppage time - and it looked as though he would have to leave it late again. With thirteen minutes to go he fired a warning shot: rounding two defenders and striking between two defenders' legs before the 'keeper saved. As the game reached extra time, Argentina's talisman looked exhausted and again drifted out of the game - but his play for the goal was class, drifting past defenders with a trademark run before slipping the ball to Di Maria to win the game.

"Former England striker Gary Lineker has hit out at Roy Hodgson's World Cup tactics and branded the Three Lion's group stage exit in Brazil a 'humiliation'. Lineker, who played in four major tournaments for England, believes that Hodgson's decision to play 4-2-3-1 instead of 4-3-3 was naive due to his side's lack of experience. Steven Gerrard's inability to organise and lead the side correctly also contributed to England's first group stage exit since 1958, according to Lineker.

While calling England's exit a 'humiliation', Lineker criticised Gerrard's 'individual' attitude and his lack or organisational skills.

Lineker added: 'It was a schoolboy error that saw England finally go . home with that dreadful second goal for Luis Suarez. 'Defensively we were not good enough.

"The finish to the final stage of the Tour de France here in England proved fairly predictable. With Mark Cavendish already out of the race with injury, it was left to the powerfully built German, the imperious Marcel Kittel, to burst away from the peloton for the second time in three days to secure victory on The Mall. Just across to where the team vehicles were gathered on Horseguard’s Parade, however, it was rather more chaotic. Emergency repair works on the Eurotunnel had the 22 teams in something of a panic - the riders might have been flying to France on Monday night but talk of ‘six hour delays’ had them concerned their bikes might be delayed - while Sir Dave Brailsford had a public relations issue to deal with.

"Rafael Nadal jinked and jumped around Centre Court, his fist shaking in relief. He had been rocked by the sheer ferocity of a Czech beast called Lukas Rosol but now he was being applauded by a crowd on its feet, a champion restored. For a few nervous, late-lunchtime moments it looked as if history might just repeat itself. It was Rosol, tall and strong, who had caused an earthquake around this part of south-west London two years ago when his powerful serve and bold shots sent Nadal out in the second round. Wimbledon had rarely witnessed a bigger shock, a 33-minute final-set dismantling under the roof by the then world No 100 of the great Rafa. Jumping for joy: Rafael Nadal roars with delight as he seals a four-set win over Lukas Rosol . Revenge: Rafa Nadal celebrates avenging his defeat to Lukas Rosol two years ago . The Centre Court auditorium can make men shrivel or make them grow like giants, and we wondered for a set and a half on Thursday whether the air — the roof was down this time — might inspire Rosol again. Now ranked 52nd in the world, Rosol took the first set and carried the momentum into the second, when he broke Nadal early and took a 4-2 lead. The Spaniard was wobbling (as well as twitching and towelling and tarrying, to Rosol’s displeasure, as the Czech made clear on court with the odd disapproving stare and afterwards in his claim that Nadal is given special treatment by officialdom). Would Rosol’s feat of 2012 play tricks with the minds of the players? After all, it was the biggest moment in one man’s career and presaged a long downturn in the fortunes of the other. There was the murmur that rustles around the court at such moments of tension. But Nadal’s forehand, whippy and powerful and trusty, combined with his warrior spirit to fight back to 4-4. The set went to a tiebreak, which the double Wimbledon champion won 8-6. We did not know it for certain yet but the outcome of the match was swinging Nadal’s way here and now. His uncle and coach, Toni, grasped some of the significance of it, though, and celebrated animatedly. Pippa Middleton, whose derriere graced a seat in the second row of the Royal Box, contented herself with a more regal clap. Revenge: Rafael Nadal beat Lukas Rosol to avenge his defeat at Wimbledon two years ago . Not this time: Lukas Rosol was unable to beat Rafael Nadal for the second time in two years . Rosol’s first serve — an Exocet missile — was less reliable in the third set, his confidence dwindling as Nadal’s grew.  The one slight black mark against the match was the speed of Nadal’s play, about which Rosol made a few reasonable points. ‘All the players should have the same time between points,’ he said. ‘The best players are taking more than the normal players and nobody is telling them anything. I don’t know why.’ Most observers thought he was lumping Nadal and Novak Djokovic together as Alphas who please themselves. Rosol added: ‘He was taking a long time between serves. He was doing all his rituals. I just asked the referee if it was OK and he said it was fine. This is not why I lost today, but the referee was not going with the rules.’ Nadal was unconcerned about the issue, happy just to have come through a tough match. Revenge was not in his vocabulary.

Looking for inspiration: Lukas Rosol started brightly but faded as the match went on . VIDEO Wimbledon: Day 4 review . John Isner reached the third round of the Championships for the first time. The American No 9 seed, who is famous here for his 70-68 fifth-set win over Nicolas Mahut in 2010 — the longest match to ever be played  at Wimbledon — defeated Finland’s Jarkko Nieminen in straight sets. Isner did show his love of long sets though, taking the opening set tie-break 19-17, the  second longest tie-break in  the history of the men’s competition. ‘What happened happened,’ he said of his defeat in 2012. ‘That’s it. We had already congratulated him for that. Today (Thursday) is another story. I need to find the solution. Finally, I did. ‘I had a good answer after being in a bit of trouble. ‘I played with fantastic energy in the last three sets. Very positive. Very quick with my legs. Very quick mentally. I was returning well. So I am very pleased with the way I played. 'After winning at Roland Garros I feel less pressure this year. I am more confident and better physically. I am practising with a different energy from the last two years because my knees work better.’ Next up is .

"She built a brand around her glamorous image but Katie Price has revealed that as she prepares to make a comeback after two pregnancies, she's embracing a new look. Katie, 36, who gave birth to her fifth child in August, told MailOnline that she is excited to get back to work after two pregnancies in the past two years. She said: 'Obviously I have been pregnant for two years so I am looking forward to getting back to work. I can’t wait to do more photoshoots, it’s where I started and what I do best, I miss them but I want to do proper styled shoots, themed ones, that are sexy.' She's back! Katie Price has been busy raising her family but says the next year is looking positive and is packed with lots of exciting plans, including a baby range and autobiography . As she prepares to unveil her 2015 calendar, which she promises will be 'sexy but tastefully done', Katie is dyeing her hair and adopting a natural look. Speaking about her current beauty regime, she said: ‘Beauty-wise, I haven’t changed my routine since having a baby. I don’t think being pregnant is an excuse to let yourself go. I don’t wear makeup, I never have. ‘I believe the art of looking good is a nice subtle spray tan on your face, I like that look, plucked and tinted eyebrows, and a manicure and pedicure. I always have those treatments.' She is also the global ambassador for ColourB4’s, a natural colour remover that claims to work by reversing the colouring process, shrinking the colour molecules along with any toxins trapped inside the hair. Au natural: Katie says that, beauty-wise, she hasn't changed her routine since having a baby. 'I don't think being pregnant is an excuse to let yourself go. I don't wear makeup, I never have,' she said . Beauty ambassador: Kate is  the global ambassador for ColourB4's new One Hour Makeover campaign, and wants to inform women that they can be the hair colour they want to be in just one hour . Speaking about her new role, she said: 'With this ColourB4 product I can keep changing my hair colour, I am having so much fun with it, I’ve never changed it so much. The aim of the campaign is to inform women that they can be the hair colour they want to be in just one hour. ‘I’m brunette now and it's a total myth that blondes have more fun but I'm changing my colour again after my book tour in the Isle of Wight next week.' When asked if there's a particular celebrity's look that she admires, Katie said: ‘It’s normal to see celebrities wearing loads of make-up, they always look immaculate. 'I think the real test is to see what they look like in the morning. Anyone can look good with makeup on. Then again, they could look good without makeup but the paps would never release those pictures.' Katie has been displaying a trim post-baby body and it may well be thanks to her personal trainer partner Kieran Hayler, the father of newborn daughter Bunny. Healthy couple: Katie and Kieran, who welcomed daughter Bunny this year, eat lots of healthy salads at home but treat themselves to takeaways every Friday . Speaking about her partner's positive influence on her diet, she said: ‘I don’t take any supplements for my hair and skin, I don’t like taking tablets but Kieran takes a lot of vitamins. 'I believe in eating healthily and I eat a lot better now. Kieran makes delicious salads for me, I never knew how to make them before and they always tasted so bland but he is really into health and fitness so knows what works. 'I love making traditional British dishes like shepherds pie and cottage pie, I don’t like chocolate, I am more into savoury treats. ‘We are very traditional, every Friday we have an Indian and on Sunday we have roast lamb.' Now that she's rekindled her relationship with Kieran, Katie is focussing on family and her career. Speaking about her future plans, she said: ‘I'm releasing a novel next week and my autobiography next year. I’ve got a perfume coming out, a baby range, and my KP equestrian range. ‘I am looking forward to getting back to work. The next year is looking good for me, I can’t wait. I’ve moved house, it’s a fresh start and I am eager to get back to doing what I do best: working.' Author: Katie has also penned a 'novel', which is out next week. She has also been writing an autobiography; the tome will hit shelves next year . Katie is the ambassador for ColourB4 available from Superdrug and Boots.","Katie, 36, gave birth to Bunny in August .

"World Cup winner Kaka has backed strikers Fred and Jo to fire Brazil to victory but admits the current strike force are not Ronaldo and Romario.

Left out: Kaka missed out on Luis Felipe Scoalri's 23-man Brazil squad for this summer's tournament . Speaking to reporters on Friday, Kaka said: 'I don't think Brazil does not have good strikers nowadays. 'I think Romario and Ronaldo were on another level; they were . another step up. 'I think Fred and Jo are good players, they are players who capable of being in . the Brazil squad.' 'Fred had a wonderful Confederations Cup last year. He did not start . this World Cup very well but he has already scored once and I think he . can be crucial and can help Brazil a lot.' Kaka has also praised Chelsea's Oscar, a player who has often been compared to the Milan legend. The Blues midfielder, who scored Brazil's third goal in the opening game victory over Croatia, has impressed Kaka, who was left out of Luiz Felipe Scolari's 23-man squad. 'Oscar has shown that he's very important to the Brazil squad,' Kaka said. 'I was really happy with his first game and with his goal. And with regards to him being like me; even I think that we have different skills.

"Defending champion Graeme McDowell fell further off the pace in the third round of the Alstom Open de France on Saturday, despite an early stumble from leader Kevin Stadler. McDowell began the day seven shots off the lead but in optimistic mood that a low round could get him back into contention at Le Golf National, venue for the 2018 Ryder Cup. However, with the overcast and windy conditions making scoring difficult, the former US Open champion instead found himself dropping shots at the first and fourth to slip back to one under par. Struggling: Graeme McDowell finished the day one under par and eight shots off the lead in France . Still finding his line: Graeme McDowell talks to his caddy during the Alstom Open in France . Stadler held a one-shot lead after a flawless opening 64 and extended his advantage to three shots thanks to a second round of 68, despite suffering a dreaded shank on his way to a double-bogey seven on his final hole. And although the world number 62 could only manage a one-over-par 72 on Saturday, the wet and windy conditions meant he finished the day four ahead of France's Victor Riu and Thailand's Thongchai Jaidee. Jaidee's 69 would have been even better if not for a bogey on the 18th, while US Open champion Martin Kaymer is six off the lead after a 70. 'I think since the first day he's running away a little bit, so I guess he likes the golf course as much as I do,' Kaymer said of Stadler, who won his first PGA Tour title in Phoenix in February. ""So I think it will be difficult to catch him. 'If the weather stays like this, I just need to shoot a very, very low score tomorrow. If you get within two or three shots of him, he might get some nerves the last three or four holes because it's a tough finish. 'But the way he plays golf and the way I know him, he's a very laid-back guy so it will be difficult to catch him. I can only try to shoot as low as I can to be happy with myself.' Leading the way: Kevin Stradler dropped some shots but was still two shots clear at the top of the leaderboard . Stadler carded one bogey and eight pars on the front nine and that allowed Riu to claim a share of the lead when he recorded his second birdie of the day on the ninth. At that point the 29-year-old from Paris was the only player in the field not to have dropped a shot, but a bogey promptly arrived on the 10th after he drove into the water and Stadler holed from 10 feet for birdie for a two-shot swing. Riu bounced straight back with a birdie on the 11th but then carded five bogeys and a birdie in the next six holes, managing his only par of the back nine on the 18th. Stadler was far more consistent with seven pars and a bogey on the 17th, despite struggling with a back injury which flared up during the round. Running away with it: US Open champion Martin  Kaymer admits it will be tough to catch Stadler . ""It's a little tight,"" the 34-year-old said. ""It's been a little out of whack all week. Luckily didn't give me a whole lot of trouble the first couple of days, but it today it turned up a bit. I'm still able to swing so should be fine. ""I got about what I deserved out of my game today. I didn't play that great, made a whole lot of pars and did not have nearly as many looks (for birdie) as I had the last couple days, but you can't expect to play that well for four days in a row. ""I knew I really didn't have to do anything crazy today. A couple less would have been nice, but overall I'm happy the way it went.""","Former US Open champion dropped shots at the first and fourth to slip back .

Yet there was a moment, somewhere between Middleham and East Witton, when it seemed that the Tour was no longer a sport, more the fantasy of a romantic director. The rain had yielded to brightness, and the moors and dales sprawled languidly to the horizon. Every cliché was obeyed, from the picture-postcard villages of mellow stone to the sturdy Norman churches, the barns bulging with hay and the fluffy clouds wafting across broad blue swathes of sky. The whole affair seemed like an adoring advertisement for the glories of Yorkshire. Which, to a great extent, it was. The Yorkshire Post spoke of the world’s greatest cycle race coming to the world’s greatest county. Yorkshiremen will not consider that a boast, more a statement of fact. Sport with a view: Early arrivals look out over Grinton Moor as they wait for Le Tour to pass by . Absent friend: This message lamented the absence of 2012 winner Sir Bradley Wiggins from this year's Tour . Stereotype: Two groups of fans dressed as the French compare outfits . Teamwork: Riders scale the Cote de Grinton Moor on the 190km route from Leeds to Harrogate . No room to move: Crowds got up, close and personal with the riders all the way along the route . Boast: The Yorkshire Post spoke of the world's greatest cycle race coming to the world¿s greatest county . Baguette? This fan was dressed for the occasion in Ilkley as the Toure de France came to Yorkshire for the first time .

What a spectacle: The riders race through Ilkley, with the entire town seemingly out to enjoy the occasion . Delicious! A fine assortment of homemade cakes on display in Ilkley . Eagle-eyed view: Spectators on top of All Saints' Church in Ilkley await the Tour riders . Inspired: The coming of Le Tour to Yorkshire will certainly encourage quite a few to get out on their bikes . Then there was the small matter of brass, which does not go overlooked here. The figure of  £100 million benefit to the local economy may have been plucked from the air by an ambitious publicist, but it is thought to be close to the truth. Certainly, the investment has proved hugely successful. All the conventions were observed. At daybreak in Leeds, later in Harrogate, and in possibly in every town and village en route, a breakfast television hack could be found pleading with crowds for a spot of raucous enthusiasm: ‘Are we excited about the Tour de France coming to Yorkshire?’ ‘Yeahhhhhh!’ It is the squirming tradition they observe for royal weddings and It’s A Knockout. But the response was everything the sport could have wished. Quite aside from the tumult of town and city, the way in which the crowds closed in on the climbers — urging, cajoling, doing everything short of hauling them to the peak — was every bit as fervent as their cousins in the Pyrenees. These were not curious observers, these were people who understood what they saw. Just yesterday, Sir Dave Brailsford, the Godfather of the sport in this country, announced his belief that Britain is the world’s premier cycling nation. Certainly, the public appears to ‘get it’, an underestimated affection which has its roots in the achievements of such as Chris Froome and Sir Bradley Wiggins, and which will increase when the next generation of cyclists states its case.  But you can discern authentic knowledge, as contenders such as Alberto Contador of Spain, Vincenzo Nibali of Italy and the American Andrew Talansky are earnestly discussed.

Calm before the storm: The scene in Skipton on the morning of the race . Celebration: German Marcel Kittel wins the first stage of the 101st edition of the Tour de France . And cycling’s appeal was easily understood. It felt like a unique occasion; a day which challenged the imagination. Sport offers few finer sights than that of the peloton unfolding like some exotic insect, writhing its way through Kidstones and Kettlewell, Masham and Muker and a whole litany of place names which have rarely been spoken with Gallic intonation. In truth, the collision of cultures was intriguing: Geoffrey Boycott meets Eric Cantona. Organisers were staggered by the numbers which turned out. It is estimated that two million will come out to cheer this Yorkshire weekend. Most seem to be wearing yellow jerseys, indeed, only Rio has more. And their optimism is heartening, . But this is Yorkshire, and the locals are not easily carried away. At breakfast in a Leeds hotel yesterday, an elderly man noticed me studying the Tour handbook. ‘You going to the bike race?’ he asked. I said I was. ‘Where’s it going?’ he inquired. I told him of the winding route through moor and dale and the circular tour of North Yorkshire. He grunted. There’s quicker ways of getting to Harrogate’, he said. Yorkshire may have embraced the Tour, but there is still work to be done.","Contrary to opinion, the British appreciate other sports beside football .

"Luis Suarez faced further criticism on Monday night after issuing a belated apology for biting Giorgio Chiellini and promising never to be involved in such an incident again - just as Barcelona stepped up their bid to sign him. Four days after receiving a four-month ban from the game and telling FIFA that the clash during Uruguay’s World Cup match against Italy in Natal was an accident in which he ‘lost balance’, the Liverpool striker made a complete U-turn and admitted he deeply regretted his actions. But the apology has led to widespread cynicism in the week that the 27-year-old was linked with an £80million move to the Nou Camp. Gary Lineker, the former Barcelona striker, claimed the Catalan giants had insisted that Suarez say sorry if any potential transfer is to go through. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the moment Suarez bit Ottman Bakkal while playing for Ajax . Apology: Luis Suarez has finally expressed his regret for biting the Italian defender last week . Thumbs up: Luis Suarez gestures to fans from the balcony of his home, near Montevideo . In the statement issued on Twitter, . Suarez said: ‘After several days of being home with my family, I have . had the opportunity to regain my calm and reflect about the reality of what occurred during the Italy-Uruguay match on 24 June 2014. ‘Independent . from the fallout and the contradicting declarations that have surfaced . during these past days, all of which have been without the intention of . interfering with the good performance of my national team, the truth . is that my colleague Giorgio Chiellini suffered the physical result of a . bite in the collision he suffered with me. ‘For this: I deeply . regret what occurred. I apologise to Giorgio Chiellini and the entire . football family. I vow to the public that there will never again be . another incident like this.’ Juventus defender Chiellini . retweeted Suarez's apology on his own site, having previously said the . four-month ban issued to Suarez should not have been so severe. Chiellini also replied to the Tweet directly, saying 'It's all forgotten. I hope FIFA will reduce your suspension.' He . had previously said: 'At the moment my only thought is for Luis and his . family, because they will face a very difficult period. 'I have . always considered unequivocal the disciplinary interventions by the . competent bodies, but at the same time I believe that the proposed . formula is excessive. 'I sincerely hope that he will be . allowed, at least, to stay close to his team mates during the games . because such a ban is really alienating for a player.'

Painful: Suarez fell to the ground and held his teeth straight after the encounter with centre back Chiellini . The 79-year-old described the . punishment, which also included a suspension for nine international . matches, as a ‘fascist ban’.

"Argentina be warned: Tim Krul can score penalties as well as save them. On a sub-zero December night in 2005 on Tyneside, the Holland goalkeeper first emerged as a shootout hero. And Krul hadn’t just made the decisive stop, he’d also blasted home from the spot to send Newcastle Under 18s into the next round of the FA Youth Cup at the expense of Stoke City. Flying Dutchman: Holland goalkeeper Tim Krul saved two penalties against Costa Rica . Spot on: Krul once scored a penalty for Newcastle in a shootout in the FA Youth Cup . Eight-and-a-half years on and Krul is again the spot-kick hero, only this time on the biggest stage of all. From Kingston Park to the Arena Fonte Nova in Salvador, the 26-year-old saved twice to book Holland’s place in the World Cup semi-finals during Saturday’s victory over Costa Rica. Krul had only been brought on by manager Louis van Gaal in the 120th minute but it was a ploy which worked and the Newcastle keeper made headlines around the world. Next up is Argentina on Wednesday and, although he is likely to revert to the bench, should the tie go the distance then he will again be called upon. And Krul would have no problem stepping up himself should the shootout enter sudden death. On that bitterly cold night in the west of Newcastle he had been one of the first to raise his hand as a volunteer taker. VIDEO Sub Krul in penalty hero . Saving grace: Bryan Ruiz sees his penalty stopped by the Newcastle goalkeeper . As it was, youth-team boss Glenn Roeder went for five outfield players, including Andy Carroll and James Troisi, who appeared for Australia in Brazil last month. But with the score at 7-7 Krul kept his nerve from 12 yards before saving Jarred Stevens’ effort to book Newcastle a fourth-round place. Against Brighton later in the competition Krul saved twice during another shootout victory but the young Magpies were eventually eliminated at the semi-final stage. Full stretch: Krul saves Michael Umana's penalty to secure Holland's semi-final place . Roeder always said that bigger nights awaited his teenage keeper.

"Elton John called Pope Francis 'my hero' at an AIDS benefit for his compassion and push to accept gays in the Catholic church. The Rocket Man singer hosted the event, An Enduring Vision: A Benefit for the Elton John AIDS Foundation, on Tuesday night in New York City. He said Francis is pushing boundaries in the church and told the crowd: 'Make this man a saint already, OK?' Scroll down for video . 'Make this man a saint already, OK?' Sir Elton John, left with his partner David Furnish, called Pope Francis, right in St Peters Square, 'my hero' at an AIDS benefit for his push to accept gays in the Catholic church . Good cause: Elton John performs at the Elton John AIDS Foundation's 13th Annual 'An Enduring Vision' benefit . 'The queen of England': John called Francis 'a loving man who wants everybody included in the love of God' 'Ten years ago one of the biggest obstacles in the fight against AIDS was the Catholic Church. Today we have a pope that speaks out about it,' said John, earning cheers from the attendees at Cipriani's on Wall Street. Catholic bishops scrapped a landmark welcome to gays earlier this month, showing deep divisions at the end of a two-week meeting sought by Francis to create a more merciful interpretation of Catholic dogma. But Francis himself, while insisting that homosexual acts are sinful, last year signalled a more tolerant era of Vatican thinking after he spoke out in defence of homosexuals. In remarks at odds with traditional rhetoric, the Pontiff refused to condemn homosexuality, saying: ‘If a person is gay and seeks God and has goodwill, who am I to judge him?’ Efforts to codify the new compassionate approach to homosexuality stumbled at the Vatican synod this month, after bishops rejected a draft document suggesting that gays should be welcomed. Stars: Alec Baldwin and Hilaria Baldwin arriving at the benefit. Right, Neil Patrick Harris, right, and David Burtka . But Francis's efforts have not gone unnoticed. 'He is a compassionate, loving man who wants everybody to be included in the love of God,' John said of the pope. 'It is formidable what he is trying to do against many, many people in the church that opposes. He is courageous and he is fearless, and that's what we need in the world today.' Speaking on the sidelines of the event, John urged gay people not to view AIDS as a problem that had gone away. 'It's important that gay people step up to the plate, acknowledge that, and wise up a little bit,' he told CBS News reporter Ken Lombardi at the gala. 'I want the gay population to realize that sacrifices were made before the medicines were available,' he said. 'They're not used to, the current generation of HIV people, seeing them die and keel over, and I did. And I don't want those people to be forgotten.' John also honoured New York Governor Andrew Cuomo for his plan to end the AIDS epidemic in his state by 2020. 'Good evening to all of you, the queen of England,' Mr Cuomo said as the crowd laughed, 'I'm from Queens, but I think there's a different interpretation there.' Notables: Kelly Tisdale and Mike Myers, who jumped onstage to offer himself for a date. Right, Brooke Shields . New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, left, with Sandra Lee: Mr Cuomo has bold plans to end NY's AIDS epidemic . More jokes came throughout the night, where attendees included John's husband, David Furnish, Neil Patrick Harris, Alec Baldwin, Matt Lauer and host Anderson Cooper. A lunch date with newsmen was part of the auction, dubbed the 'great anchor sandwich,' and it sold for $40,000. 'I will give a little extra with dessert if you know what I mean,' Mr Cooper said at the top of the event. 'It could be a long, saucy lunch.' Mike Myers jumped onstage to offer himself for a lunch date following the bid for Cooper and Lauer, and his was auctioned for $50,000. A Damien Hirst painting sold for $270,000 and a Robert Mapplethorpe sold for $90,000. John, who sat while the honorees gave speeches, said he was recovering from a knee operation that took place last week. He performed a rousing set at the end of the night, singing hits like 'Tiny Dancer' and 'Your Song' while playing the piano. Four tickets and backstage access to his New Year's Eve concert at the Barclays Center sold for $35,000.","Rocket Man singer hails pontiff for pushing boundaries in Catholic Church .

"Rio Ferdinand has admitted he is disappointed not to have the chance to play under Louis van Gaal at Manchester United. The centre-back left Old Trafford when his contract ran out at the end of the domestic season in May, and now looks set for a move to recently-promoted QPR.

It was my chance just to say thank you.’ Controversy: Ferdinand says his meeting with Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon in 2005 was by chance . Ferdinand also discussed the drama surrounding his meeting with Chelsea’s chief executive Peter Kenyon at a restaurant in London in 2005. The meeting saw his popularity among United fans plummet, particularly as it came during negotiations over a new contract at Old Trafford and just after he had completed his eight-month ban. ‘I explain that in my new book, but I just want to reiterate that I was never a part of that meeting,’ said the former England international. ‘I bumped into my agent and he was sat with Peter Kenyon. It was literally just a case of me popping in to say hello. I don’t even think I ordered a drink! ‘I left after 10 or 15 minutes, but somebody obviously took a photo. A snapshot of a moment can lead to so many stories.’ Ferdinand said his on-pitch relationship with Nemanja Vidic, who will leave United to join Inter Milan this summer, was the best of his career. Teamwork: Ferdinand says his on-field relationship with Nemanja Vidic was the best of his whole career . 'Playing alongside each other for so many years we were so successful together,’ he explained. ‘Off the pitch there have been so many – at the beginning there was Wes Brown and then Wayne Rooney. ‘Obviously Michael Carrick and myself both came through at West Ham so we always had that relationship. ‘But I’m lucky in that I’ve got a great relationship loads of the lads – Scholesy [Paul Scholes], Giggsy [Ryan Giggs], Fletch [Darren Fletcher], Robin [van Persie], Wazza [Rooney], Welbz [Danny Welbeck]…it’s not fair for me to name just one because I’m good pals with all of them.’ Dejected: Ferdinand looks distraught with Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes after the 2009 Champions League final .

"The Italian official accused last week of favouring Argentina and Lionel Messi has been chosen to referee their World Cup final against Germany. Nicola Rizzoli, a 42-year-old who refereed the 2013 Champions League final at Wembley, will take charge of the match in the Maracana on Sunday but his appointment may be controversial. VIDEO Scroll down to see David Beckham predict an Argentina win . In charge: Italian referee Nicola Rizzoli has been chosen to referee the World Cup final on Sunday . Rizzoli was the target of criticism from Belgium's Marc Wilmots after the 1-0 quarter-final defeat by Argentina last Saturday. Wilmots claimed: 'I don't want to be a cry baby, but I noticed the referee never gives fouls against Argentina. 'Every time something happens with Messi the referee gives him a free-kick. 'I notice he [Messi] made three fouls and no yellow card, we made one foul and one yellow card.' Side issue: Referee Rizzoli was accused of favouring Argentina and Lionel Messi . It will be the third time this World Cup that Rizzoli has refereed a match involving Argentina - he was also in charge of the South Americans' 3-2 win over Nigeria in Group F. His first match of the tournament was Holland's 5-1 triumph over Spain in the group stage. Ravshan Irmatov, from Uzbekistan, had been viewed as one of the favourites for the final as he is from neither Europe nor South America, but he does not have a team of assistants who work all the time with him. England's Howard Webb was never in contention to referee the final - he was in charge of the 2010 showpiece and FIFA has never before appointed an official to referee two World Cup finals. Under fire: Rizzoli was the target of criticism from Belgium boss Marc Wilmots . It was also felt that it would be too sensitive to have Webb referee a match in which Argentina are involved - the team are still going through a FIFA disciplinary process for displaying a banner claiming the Falkland Islands should belong to their country. Furthermore, Argentina's FIFA senior vice-president Julio Grondona has never hidden his disdain for England. In 2011 he called the English 'liars' at the FIFA Congress and in an interview with the German press agency DPA referred to the English as 'pirates'.","Third time this World Cup that Rizzoli has refereed a match involving Argentina .

A planning application to erect 20 'medieval-style' lodges in a 'glamping ground' has been submitted by company which owns the castle, along with Alton Towers, Legoland and Madame Tussauds. Owners of Warwick Castle have submitted an application for 20 'medieval-style' lodges in a 'glamping ground' 'Glamping' is a more luxurious take on camping and often involves sleeping in beautifully furnished yurts . Merlin Entertainments also wants to build five large tree houses in the castle's landscaped grounds. But residents have objected to the latest stage in the 'Disneyfication' of Warwick Castle, saying they fear it will become Butlins-on-Avon. Veronica Hyland, whose garden backs onto the castle wall, said: 'Warwick Castle is a jewel in the crown of our national treasures, that is visited by people from all over the world, but it is being turned into a Disney-style theme park.' As one of Warwick's tree wardens, she told the Sunday Times she fears that the tents and lodges will damage roots and the woodland could be lost forever. Merlin Entertainments also wants to build five large tree houses in the castle's landscaped grounds . 'The Campaign to Protect Rural England, the Woodland Trust and the Warwickshire Wildlife Trust are all against it, but the council seems determined it should go ahead,' she said. If the plans are approved by Warwick district council at its meeting next month, the holiday village will be built 500 metres south of the castle on a site known as Foxes Study. Merlin Entertainments' application states: 'The proposed glamping tents will have no significant effect on the character and appearance of the wider or immediate sub-area of the Warwick Conservation area, particularly given the relatively enclosed nature of the application site and given the site is well screened by the existing mature trees, dense foliage and shrubs.' 'Glamping' is a more luxurious take on camping and often involves sleeping in beautifully furnished yurts rather than a two-man tent. A motte-and-bailey castle was built in 1068 by the Normans following William the Conqueror’s victory in the Battle of Hastings. By 1260 stone had replaced wood as the Gatehouse, corner defensive posts and the main building (now the site of the house) on the riverside wall of the Courtyard were built. During the Wars of the Roses, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, imprisoned King Edward IV in Warwick Castle in 1469. Richard III ordered for two gun towers to be added to Warwick Castle in the 1480s. These were called Bear Tower and Clarence Tower. During the 16th century, Warwick Castle started to fall into disrepair. In fact, when Queen Elizabeth I visited, a separate building had to be built for her to stay in. In 1604, Warwick Castle was given to Sir Fulke Greville in 1604 by James I. The Greville family, who owned the property until 1978, set about converting it to magnificent country house. Royalist forces laid siege to Warwick Castle during the First English Civil War in 1642. In 1978, the Greville family sold Warwick Castle and it was opened as a tourist attraction. One of the world’s largest working trebuchets (massive siege catapults) has been built in the grounds of Warwick Castle. Warwick Castle has had more than 35 different owners since it was built by Henry II.","Owners of Warwick Castle want to build 20 'medieval-style' glamping lodges .

"A frisson of pain suddenly broke out on Novak Djokovic’s face after he slipped on the worn baseline and crumpled on the hard turf of Centre Court. His left shoulder had landed smack on the ground and, for a few moments in the third set, his progress in the tournament was potentially in jeopardy. He lay on the floor, his painful joint being manipulated by healing hands. Making light of the trouble, he closed out the match to maintain a remarkable record: he will now play his 21st consecutive Grand Slam fourth round and his sixth successively at Wimbledon, against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Whitwell and Fraser's Wimbledon day five update . Ouoch: Novak Djokovic falls heavily during his match against Gilles Simon . Tumble: Djokovic takes a fall during the third set but he recovered to win . Worry: Djokovic received treatment on his left shoulder during the third set before wrapping up victory . ‘It was a scary fall,’ recalled Djokovic. ‘I had a strong impact. When I stood up, I felt a click or pop. I feared it might be dislocated or a joint problem. ‘Going out in that way would be the worst possible exit. But luckily it had a minor effect on the joint and the muscle around it. I had ultrasound but it’s all looking good.’ Consistency was not the story of Djokovic’s performance on Friday. No sooner had he broken his French opponent Gilles Simon’s erratic serve than he would be broken back. Yes, Simon was pesky but Djokovic was undone as much by his own shifts of mood. The Serb lost service games in all three sets and more than once threw his arms wide in disbelief and whacked loose balls high into the sky in exasperation. The world No 2 has not won a Grand Slam since last year’s French Open and he will need to develop as the fortnight continues if he is to add a seventh major title to his cv. In pain: Djokovic clutches his left shoulder after taking nasty tumble during his match with Simon . Treatment: Djokovic's shoulder was tended to before he resumed to complete his victory . ‘There are things in my game I would like to improve in a few days and see if I can do better in the next match,’ he said. ‘But, for now, everything is going in the right direction and I hope that I will elevate my game as the tournament progresses. If I don’t do that, I’ll find myself in a very difficult position.’ There were a few faux-amusing moments. A male voice from the crowd shouted: ‘I love you Novak.’ Novak put his thumb up. One doubts Djokovic’s girlfriend Jelena Ristic was worried. When, a little while later, someone — perhaps the same humourist — shouted; ‘I love you Boris,’ the remark fell flat. Smash: Djokovic hits an overhead shot on his way to beating Frenchman Simon . Relief: Djokovic celebrates after coming through a tough third-round match against Simon . The Boris in question was of course his coach Boris Becker, the three-time Wimbledon champion who sat impassively in the box until Djokovic won and turned towards his supporting cast. Djokovic clenched his fist; Becker clapped his hands. ‘I talked with Boris,’ said Djokovic. ‘We obviously need to work on my diving volleys, learning how to fall down on the court. I’m not very skilful in that.’ He was smiling as he said it. ‘Where he helps me the most and where I feel the biggest change is from a mental point of view,’ he added. ‘Obviously it is going to take a little time for us to find the perfect balance and for the work to be reflected on court with results. No reply: Simon had his chances against Djkokovic but couldn't take advantage . ‘But we already have a couple of titles together. We have the final of the French Open. It’s already starting to build up. I am starting to feel the effect of his advice and his presence.’ Djokovic at least has two clear days before playing Tsonga, the 29-year-old Frenchman who was his semi-final victim in 2011. What does he expect? ‘I don’t fear anything,’ said Djokovic. ‘I expect him to serve well. Coming to the net, he’s a very aggressive player. If he feels good on the day, he can beat anybody.’","No 1 seed Novak Djokovic into last 16 after win over Gilles Simon .

"One hundred years ago this week, the First World War hospital ship Rohilla ran aground in horrific conditions off the coast of Yorkshire. Lifeboats fought through a fierce storm to reach the stricken vessel, but, after a three-day rescue mission which saved 144 people, dozens of medical staff and crew died. Yesterday a flotilla of 15 boats sailing from Whitby, North Yorkshire, marked one of the most dramatic rescues in history, lowering a wreath into the waters where 85 people died. The Rohilla ran aground 400 yards from the shore near Whitby, North Yorkshire. A total of 85 died, but 144 survived after one of the most dramatic rescue missions in British naval history . A flotilla yesterday paid tribute to those who died, as well as the rescuers - including the Whitby RNLI lifeboat crew (pictured) - involved in the Rohilla rescue in 1914 . Paying their respects: The RNLI and others laid wreathes in the waters where the Rohilla ran aground 100 years ago last week . On October 30, 1914, the hospital ship set sail from Edinburgh to Dunkirk to evacuate wounded soldiers, but would not reach the French coast. With lighthouses off and a storm raging on the north-east, Captain Neilson was unable to stop the ship from running aground on a reef about 400 yards from the coast. As it became clear that the ship was sinking, dozens of people on board the ship made the decision to try and swim to safety, but many did not make it. The conditions were so horrendous that lifeboats from nearby towns struggled for days to reach the ship, however they were eventually able to rescue 144 men and women. A total of 85 perished in one of the worst disasters in British naval history. People aboard the 15-boat flotilla of lifeboats sailed to the wreckage site to pay their respects by lowering wreathes into the water. The commemoration, organised by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), saw the lifeboats sail to the site, where a service was held to remember Rohilla's heros. Coxwain of Whitby Lifeboat Mike Russell,and mechanic Richard Dowson lay an anchor shaped wreath over the wreck of the Rohilla . Tragic: The ship was on its way to Dunkirk to rescue wounded First World War soldiers when it ran aground in 1914 . Lifeboats fought through a fierce storm to reach the stricken vessel, but, after a three-day rescue mission by the RNLI and other boats, which saved 144 people, dozens of medical staff and crew died . Tributes: Families of the doomed passengers came from all over the world to remember those who died . Families of the doomed passengers came from all over the world to remember those who died, including Steven Kirk and his wife Lorraine, who travelled from Australia to pay respects to his great grandfather George Kirk, a member of the crew who was lost in the disaster. Steven said: 'It's a great privilege to be here to share in this very special occasion. 'Even though I never knew George and his incredible story wasn't one I learned about until fairly recently, I felt it was important to be here to pay my respects to him and all the other people who died on the Rohilla.' He added: 'This has been a great honour.' Also launched as part of the flotilla was historic lifeboat the William Riley, which, 100 years ago, was lowered on a rope into the crashing waves in a bid to rescue the 229 people on board the Rohilla. The William Riley was one of six vessels which carried out the three-day mission to save the passengers. One of the first motor lifeboats, the Henry Vernon - the only vessel able to reach the last 50 survivors on board the stricken ship - also took part in the event. A plaque on Whitby's West Pier was also unveiled this weekend while a special church service was held in remembrance of the people on board the doomed vessel, names which included Titanic survivor Mary Kezia Roberts, who also survived the disaster. Whitby's RNLI museum curator Peter Thompson MBE said: 'This commemorative weekend has been a very long time in the planning and I'm proud that we have been able to pay a fitting tribute to both those who died and to those who struggled against all the odds to rescue the survivors. 'Fortunately, the weather was kind to us. We have had very different conditions to those experienced 100 years ago on board the Rohilla. 'It was very moving to be able to go out to the site of the Rohilla wreck and to remember just what it must have been like for the poor souls on board the stricken vessel, some of them waiting more than two days to be rescued. 'We must never forget stories like this one, or the people who died during one of the worst tragedies ever to take place off the Yorkshire coast.' A plaque on Whitby's West Pier was also unveiled this weekend while a special church service was held in remembrance of the people on board the doomed vessel . Twice a survivor: Mary Kezia Roberts was on board the Titanic and the Rohilla . Stewardess Mary Kezia Roberts was a stewardess on board the Titanic when it sunk on April 14, 1912. More than 1,500 people died but she, and hundreds of other people on board the doomed vessel, were rescued. She would later note that the White Star Line stopped her pay at 2.20am, the exact time Titanic sank. Not put off life at sea, the mother-of-five continued working on ships for the next two years. In 1914, she boarded the SS Rohilla. Little did she know that she would be involved in another disastrous shipwreck. As the Rohilla sank Mary Roberts was brought ashore by lifeboat, and was later quoted as saying the Rohilla sinking was worse to endure than the Titanic. Miss Roberts, one of only five women aboard the Rohilla, was among the first 17 survivors rescued by the Whitby lifeboatmen, which went back to rescue a further 18 before it too was smashed by the storm. 99 years later her trunk, which was left on the ship in the panic to escape the sinking, washed ashore. The trunk, an intriguing relic of maritime history, was recovered by the Whitby Lifeboat Museum, after its curator, Pete Thomson, spotted it for sale on eBay. He said: 'It’s spooky, the fact that I have got this here now, 99 years later. Mary Roberts carried it on to the Rohilla and then she never saw it again. 'When the sea calmed down the rocks would be crawling with people picking up items and it’s been missing for the last 99 years until it surfaced on eBay for sale a month ago.'","The First World War hospital ship Rohilla ran aground in horrific conditions off the coast of Yorkshire in 1914 .

"Gemma Hollings, 37, has been jailed for eight years after she attacked partner Paul Kirkpatrick, 30, slashing his neck with a broken bottle . A woman who hit her partner with a hammer and pole, and slashed him with a broken glass bottle  has been jailed for eight years. Gemma Hollings, 37, was jailed for two counts of grievous bodily harm, and two of assault, in 'one of the worst cases of domestic violence' police had ever seen. Paul Kirkpatrick, 30, had his neck slashed with a bottle, suffered a cut above his eye, and had a bone in his face broken after a vicious attack in May. Police found the victim lying in the street after he ran away from the home he shared with his partner in Darwen, Lancashire. He told officers that she had caused the wounds after an argument over her hair straighteners. Speaking after the hearing at Preston Crown Court, DC Jenny Berry, said: 'The victim suffered very traumatic injuries. They could have potentially been fatal. 'This was a nasty attack. It is certainly one of the most serious cases of domestic violence I have ever come across. It was a relentless assault. 'Justice has now been done for the victim and he just wants to forget about the whole thing and move on with his life.' She added: 'The bottle had been used to cause the injury to his neck. When the victim was found, he did not really understand the significance of his injuries. 'Since the attack, he has been able to move on. He has moved away and is not living in Darwen anymore. He has made a fresh start now that Hollings is in prison and the further away from her he is, the better.' The officer said cases of domestic violence against men were not reported to police as often as those against women. She added: 'We do not hear of many cases  of domestic violence against men because they are very much under-reported. 'This is the first domestic violence case I have dealt with which has involved a man. Preston Crown Court (pictured) heard that Hollings attacked Mr Kirckpatrick over the course of two days after the couple got into a fight over a pair of hair straighteners . 'Tackling the issue is one of our main priorities and I would urge anyone, male of female, who is experiencing it to come forward.' Wendy Chappell, senior prosecutor, said: 'Gemma Hollings carried out a series of violent attacks on her partner over two days using her bare hands and several weapons. 'He received extremely serious injuries resulting in him requiring hospital treatment. 'Everyone has the right to feel safe and be safe in their personal relationships, therefore, the CPS and police take all cases of domestic violence extremely seriously regardless of whether the victim is male or female. 'Bringing the perpetrators of such offences to justice remains a high priority. Domestic violence is still a largely hidden crime,  and police forces have been criticised for poor data collection on the issue. But based on current estimates, it is believed that 30 per cent of women and 16 per cent of men have experienced domestic abuse since the age of 16. Almost 40 per cent of domestic violence victims are thought to be male, with an estimated 720,000 men attacked in the last year, compared to 1.2million women. That gap narrows considerably when it comes to the most severe type of abuse, with 1 per cent of men falling into that category, compared with 1.4 per cent of women. While the issue is now more widely reported by all victims, men are still twice as likely to stay silent after abuse. This year Home Secretary Theresa May raised the prospect of a new offence of domestic abuse. The new charge would cover grey areas such as stalking and financial control that are not wholly covered under existing laws. - Data provided by charity ManKind . 'I would like to encourage anyone who has been a victim of such offences to come forward and report it to the police and we will support you in every possible way.' Rachel Horman, a solicitor specialising in domestic violence, at  Watson Ramsbottom, said men often felt too embarrassed to tell the authorities. She said: 'It is harder for men to come forward because of ideas of masculinity and that men should be tough. Some men feel ashamed, but I would urge them to get help from the police or domestic violence charities. 'They should not be embarrassed because every specialist will have dealt with men before.' According to Home Office statistics, 2.7 million men have experienced some form of domestic abuse in their lifetimes, with 700,000 victims reported in 2012/13 alone. A spokeswoman from the Hyndburn and Ribble Valley Domestic Violence Team said they often saw cases of domestic violence against men, but that there were still more women who came forward. She said: “Regardless of gender, if you are feeling frightened or want someone to talk to about something going on in the home, give us a call and we can support you. 'Gender does not matter, everybody is treated as an individual.' Clive Grunshaw, Lancashire’s police and crime commissioner, said: 'Domestic abuse is a problem which affects all sections of society, and is one which I take very seriously. 'It is vitally important all victims - whether they are male or female - feel they are able to come forward. The courage and bravery displayed by the victim in this case is to be commended. 'Abuse is never the fault of the victim.'","Gemma Hollings, 37, attacked partner after row over hair straighteners .

"This was such a sublime obliteration that towards the end of it, Roger Federer’s many worshippers were cheering on Paolo Lorenzi — a little-known Italian without a prayer — in the hope that he could prolong their entertainment. When Lorenzi won a game he smiled and saluted the crowd. When he won a point it was met by loud applause. He even saved five match points. The only  problem was that he won too few points and too few games and Federer was predictably victorious. There was to be no repeat of last year’s humbling of a great champion; Federer’s watch-through-your-fingers second-round defeat by Sergiy Stakhovsky, a Ukrainian who was 116 in the world. Easy win: Roger Federer made short work of Paolo Lorenzi on day of Wimbledon . Praise me: Federer, still a darling of Wimbledon, takes the acclaim of the crowd on Court One . No, the great Federer won with a big . ace down the middle and duly put Wimbledon back on its axis here. It took him 24 minutes to win the first set and 1hr 33min to . complete the job. But for Lorenzi’s fleeting, late obduracy, Federer . could have been back home to share a late lunch with his newly-expanded . family. His wife Mirka was . in Court One, clapping her man. The two sets of twins, Myla and . Charlene, aged four, and Leo and Lenny, aged seven weeks, were waiting . for Super Dad back at their base down the road. ‘It’s . nice having the family with you as much as possible,’ he said. ‘They . know I play a lot of tennis. I don’t know if they understand it is a . job. They know I play for a trophy and all that stuff.’ The . chances of siring two sets of identical twins have been estimated at . one in 700,000 but what of Federer, 32, winning an eighth Wimbledon . title? In doing that he would become the oldest champion here in the . modern era, beating 31-year-old Arthur Ashe in 1975. There . were no more than clues in what we saw in this first-round match but we . can say that the Swiss’s recent upturn in form  continues.

If . he has lost a little speed  with age, the delicacy of his shot- making . endures. He said his larger racket head has given him more power on his . serve. He volleyed more than . in recent years, moving to the net regularly and confidently, and . declaring that ‘it could be that little extra piece to the puzzle’. ‘I . didn’t serve and volley all the time,’ said Federer, who has worked on . the tactic with his coach Stefan Edberg. ‘That’s not how I intend to . play. But mixing it up a little bit could be the way to go.’ Something . of the ego still sparkles, even if last year’s defeat and the rise of .

"Cat-lover Maria Harrison had no idea that her love of  furry felines would one day lead to her opening her very own cat cafe. Ms Harrison, who owns Willows Cat Adoption Centre in South Shields, Newcastle upon Tyne, serves up coffee and cake with a side of kitten to raise much needed funds for her homeless moggies. And her cafe is so popular that visitors have to book ahead before turning up for their 45-minute kittie catch-up. Scroll down for video . Maria Harrison's Willow Cat Cafe is part of the feline adoption centre that she owns . Feline fans in the area can now pet kittens as they sip coffee and munch on homemade chocolate, sticky ginger, and cherry and walnut cake. Ms Harrison thought of opening Willows Cat Cafe after hearing that cafes featuring cats were doing brisk business in London, New York and Tokyo. She said: 'I knew it was popular so I thought it could definitely work. 'People may think it's unusual but for me it was a completely natural idea to bring to the shelter. The cafe is open every Monday from 11am to 2pm. 30 to 45 minute slots are available to visitors. 'You do need to book ahead - we have to have some sort of structure otherwise it would just be manic,' Ms Harrison said. Picture purrrfect: The cafe is open every Monday from 11am to 2pm with 30 to 45-minute visiting slots . 'We have already been open for around 12 weeks and the feedback has been brilliant. 'Visitors have loved to see our lovely cats in a calm and relaxed atmosphere, and you can see the cats enjoy it too; they love all the fuss and attention. 'At the moment we have about 12 to 14 cats at the shelter, so the cafe is also a golden opportunity to raise funds. 'Everything we do make from the cafe goes towards vet costs and the cost of running the shelter. 'It really is unique and is a very special experience for cat lovers to just come along and see us.' 'And there has been quite an increase in adoptions, which is wonderful,' she said. Curious kitty: Ms Harrison says that the the cafe is 'also a golden opportunity to raise funds' There are currently between 12 to 14 cats in the shelter. Visitors sometimes visit the centre just to have coffee with the cats . 'Me and my sister, both cat lovers just decide to come down and support the adoption centre and it's absolutely lovely,' said a visitor. 'Even if you can't have a cat for yourself it's just nice to come down and spend a little time with the cats. It's really good fun,' she continued. Cat cafes first took off in Japan 10 years ago, and have since been established in areas across the UK.","Maria Harrison's Willow Cat Cafe is part of her cat adoption centre .

Having cancer was difficult enough without the weight gain, however Kelly says that Kevin has helped her find a whole new lease of life. 'It was absolutely devastating to hear that I had cancer - I have never felt so down in all my life. 'I was on all kinds of steroids and I spent most of my days in bed so naturally my weight shot up.

He is now hoping to transform the lives of others who want to tone up after passing on his secrets to friends and family members. Kevin says that helping Kelly was incredibly rewarding and that he hopes that many more will follow in her footsteps. 'I do a lot of boot camp classes at the local gym but with other people I'll visit them at home and give them a class there. 'It's incredibly satisfying when someone thanks you for helping them get into shape and feel fit and healthy. 'Kelly's story is just incredible - she's a real fighter. She's now helping others to do the same which is a fantastic feeling.' Kelly added that her body transformation has reminded her not to give up hope and has kept her optimistic for her future.

"A 60-year-old Illinois man is claiming a 33-year-old nurse forced him to have sex with her while he lay in his hospital bed awaiting a heart transplant - and he's suing the hospital for more than $200,000. In a Cook County Circuit Court complaint, John Cantone said that at 9 p.m. on Oct. 12, 2012, Rachel Shaper entered his Advocate Christ Medical Center room and 'initiated unsolicited sexual relations, including intercourse,' with Cantone while he  lay in 'compromised health.' Cantone was in the care of the registered nurse in the cardiac intensive care unit of the hospital, located in West Chicago, awaiting a heart transplant at the time of the alleged abuse, according to The Smoking Gun. Scroll down for video . John Cantone, 60, (right) accused Rachel Shaper, 33, (left) of forcing sex on him while he lay in compromised health at the Advocate Christ Medical Center in West Chicago. Cantone said that Shaper had a 'propensity to initiate unauthorized physical contact' with patients in her care . Cantone was reportedly medicated with 'various drugs and was under electronic monitoring' at the time. The complaint states that as a result of Shaper's battery, Cantone 'suffered injury and damages of a personal and pecuniary nature.' Cantone claimed in the complaint  that ACMD officials knew that Shaper had a tendency to engage in unauthorized activities with patients in her care but failed to supervise or terminate her employment. Cantone's wife, Laura, is co-plaintiff in the lawsuit. Laura said, in the complaint, that Shaper's conduct caused 'damage to the marital relationship including damage to the society, companionship, and sexual relationship with her husband.' The Smoking Gun reports that Shaper was formally reprimanded in January for, what is described in the complaint as, failing to report her termination from the ACMD. Shaper later admitted to failing to disclose details of her termination. Cantone's wife claims that Shaper's conduct has damaged their sexual relationship . According to the complaint, Shaper's lawyer said during mitigation that Shaper has been licensed since 2009 without prior discipline, she cooperated with the state's Department of Financial and Professional Regulation Division of Professional Regulation and voluntarily completed a boundary course, and no patients were harmed as a result of her actions. Department officials reprimanded Shaper's registered nurse license, according to the complaint, however, her license is currently active and will remain valid until May 2016, according to The Smoking Gun.

"Only in Test cricket could a batsman face 55 balls without scoring a single run yet still come desperately close to becoming the hero before having his moment of glory cruelly snatched away with just one delivery remaining. Such was the fate of Jimmy Anderson in an extraordinary finish to the second Test at Headingley on Tuesday night as Sri Lanka claimed their historic first series victory in England despite a dramatic rearguard that so nearly denied them. Anderson, the man who held firm in Cardiff five years ago to deny Australia, repelled everything Sri Lanka threw at him in a last wicket stand with Moeen Ali that seemingly earned a draw that had long appeared out of England’s reach. Yet just as it seemed all the hard work had been done, just as it appeared that England would get out of a huge hole of their own making, Shaminda Eranga had the final glorious word for Sri Lanka. Scroll down for videos . Devastated: Moeen Ali goes over to console James Anderson who was dismissed for a duck off 55 balls . The end: James Anderson leans on his bat as Sri Lanka go into raptures after his wicket wins them the series . Pulling stumps: Sri Lanka players celebrate winning their first series in England . Elated: Sri Lanka celebrates after Rangana Herath claims the wicket of England tailender Liam Plunkett . VIDEO Prior calls on England to fight . Emotional: Anderson holds back tears as he is awarded England's player of the series award . A ball short: Anderson was dismissed on the penultimate delivery of the match . Just as the first Test had gone down . to the final ball before the match was drawn this one lasted until . 7.07pm and the penultimate ball of the final over before this Investec . series finally swung decisively in Sri Lanka’s favour. Anderson, . who had joined the mighty Moeen with 122 balls remaining and the Test . all but lost, was barely troubled until Eranga delivered a short pitched . brute of a delivery that Anderson could only fend off gently to Rangana . Herath. The leader of . England’s attack held his head and sank to his knees, just as Stuart . Broad had done when he could not force a victory at Lord’s, and was in . tears afterwards at the post-match presentation. He could have done no . more. England had come . so, so close to becoming the first side to bat through the final day of a . Test having begun it five wickets down but ultimately had to face up to . the harsh reality of losing an early summer series for the first ever . time. This was a . heart-wrenching way to sink to a defeat but the way England held out so . doggedly for so long will only increase their sense of frustration at a . Test and a series they simply threw away. Ten . chances in all were squandered in this match by England who also wasted . a position of dominance with the bat in the first innings and then . crashed to 57 for five on the penultimate evening when chasing a . theoretical 357. VIDEO I'm gutted for Jimmy and the lads - Moeen . Understated: Moeen Ali doesn't even remove his helmet in celebration of his maiden Test century as he pushed to save the match for England . Job to do: Moeen simply raised his bat and was congratulated by James Anderson after reaching the milestone . Padded away: Anderson shows no interest in scoring lasting more than 50 without getting off the mark . Under pressure: Tailender Anderson is crowded by Sri Lanka fielders as they fought for the final wicket . Their . gallant failure should not be allowed to mask those shortcomings and the . grim reality that they have suffered a massive setback in their quest . to start afresh after the winter horrors of Australia. Yet when the . dust settles on what should be recognised as a significant triumph for . Sri Lanka, England will take huge consolation in the performances of the . new players who have all made an impact throughout two long, hard . Tests. None more so than Moeen, who was simply brilliant in scoring . his maiden Test century in the most difficult of circumstances and . displayed both a calmness and pure elegance of strokes that mark him out . as a new star of English cricket. It was hard to believe that Moeen . was playing in just his second Test, such was the maturity and skill . with which he marshalled the England defence throughout the final day . and so nearly towards a joyous conclusion. VIDEO Mathews delighted after historic victory . Magic number: Dhammika Prasad celebrates his fifth wicket after dismissing Prior for 10 . On his way: Matt Prior was dismissed for 10 when he was caught by Kaushal Silva off Dhammika Prasad . Resistance: Joe Root was the first wicket to fall on day five when he fell for 31 off 108 balls . Chin music: Root is struck by a short ball during a hostile morning spell from Sri Lanka's seamers . Chat: Root and Herath exchange words during play on day five at Headingley . Any concerns that he may . not be good enough to be a specialist spinner – and he is a much better . bowler than even England seem to realise – should be shelved. This . impressive character is good enough as a batsman alone. A sparse . crowd of barely 2,000 here at Headingley turned up more in hope than . expectation as Moeen joined Joe Root at the start of the final day with . seemingly only the full extent of England’s humiliation to be decided. And . it quickly became clear that the bad feeling between these sides that . began with the reporting of Sachithra Senanayake for throwing had . reached boiling point, with Sri Lanka taking their verbal attack on Root . to the limits. When Nuwan Pradeep finally found a way past Root Sri . Lankan joy knew no bounds but there was to be more controversy in the . form of two no balls, one that was given and one that was not before the . Test was eventually settled. Firstly, when Matt Prior was bounced . out, a technological check on Dhammika Prasad’s front foot found him . perilously close to being in front of the line. TV umpire Paul Reiffel . gave the benefit of the doubt to the bowler, a novel twist on an old . cricketing tradition introduced in their wisdom by the ICC. Valiant: Moeen Ali led England's hopes of saving the match on the final day showing his class with the bat . Hitting out: Moeen shows some aggression with a blow to mid-wicket on a day where survival was the key . Nearly there: Spinner Herath and Sri Lanka celebrate the wicket of Chris Jordan (L), England's eighth to fall . Yet when . Chris Jordan was caught off Eranga an apparently identical foot position . this time led to a no ball call and a reprieve for the batsman. Confused? Address all your inquiries to a Mr D Richardson of the ICC in . Dubai. Jordan did not hang around to take advantage of his let-off . and when Stuart Broad was trapped by Hearth the ball after refusing a . single England’s fate looked complete. Yet there was so nearly a final . barely believable twist. Alastair Cook will have gone through every . emotion over two contrasting final days of this series but this will . have increased his resolve to silence the doubters by fighting on . against India, starting at Trent Bridge on July 9. He has seen his . side lose this series despite three batsmen in Moeen, Sam Robson and . Gary Ballance all scoring their maiden hundreds in only their second . Test and Liam Plunkett return to Test cricket with a nine-wicket haul . here. There is promise for England but there is also the harsh . reality that the captain needs both runs and victories and he needs them . very quickly.

"Genie’s Army did not march in great numbers, but the heiress apparent to Maria Sharapova as the glamour queen of tennis took a significant step towards the queen of Wimbledon on Tuesday night.

Di Stefano was the European Cup's top scorer with 49 goals in 58 matches before being overtaken by Raul. The Argentine is now sixth on the all-time list, having also been surpassed by Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Thierry Henry. On the international scene, he represented Spain on 31 occasions and also played for Argentina and Colombia. Argentine heroes: Di Stefano (left) with Deigo Maradona in 1995 .

Cristiano Ronaldo tweeted: 'Don Alfredo leaves us, but his memory will last forever in our hearts. Legends never die. Thanks for everything Maestro. #EternoAlfredo' Sir Alex Ferguson, in an exclusive interview with Sky Sports News, described di Stefano as ‘the greatest' and recalled seeing his ‘fantastic balance and poise’ as a teenager in the schoolboy enclosure at Hampden Park for the 1960 final. 'I was very sad to hear the news. Even at 88 it is a bit of a shock. I saw him two years ago before our Real Madrid game and he looked fine and looked full of health so it is disappointing to hear the news. 'He had a fantastic balance and poise. If you look at one of the goals he scored in the final against Eintracht Frankfurt it was completely what we are saying about the balance and poise, unbelievable he was. ‘The amazing thing about that game, being a Rangers fan, was that Eintracht Frankfurt had beaten Rangers in the semi-finals and they were looked on as Gods, but they came to Hampden and were annihilated by Real 7-3. ‘I was in the schoolboy enclosure, I was playing with Queen’s Park at the time, and it was a fantastic experience to see that game. It was the first time we had seen a lap of honour after a game. ‘In terms of European finals, to see 10 goals in one game, you won’t see that again. It was a golden period for Real Madrid with di Stefano, and for them to win it  five times and for di Stefano to have scored in all five finals was quite an amazing record.’ The two would cross paths 23 years later when Ferguson, then manager of Aberdeen, met a Real Madrid side managed by Di Stefano in the 1983 Cup Winners' Cup final. Against the odds it was Ferguson's Scottish underdogs who won the trophy that night, with the Glaswegian impressed by Di Stefano's grace in defeat. 'My greatest memory of course is when Aberdeen beat Real Madrid,' he added. 'I was honoured to be in the same game as Real Madrid but to come up against Di Stefano was an incredible experience for me. 'When you mention the great players they had they were household names. Aberdeen were a team on the rise and after the game he was very generous and he said Aberdeen had a team that money can't buy, a soul and a family spirit. 'He couldn't say any more in praise of a football team and that was very generous of him. He had a fantastic life and I was really proud to have been associated with him in a small way.' Jose Mourinho: 'It was with immense sadness I learned of the death of Alfredo Di Stefano, a wonderful man I had the fortune to know during my time in Madrid. 'Of course I first send my thoughts to his family and friends, but also this is a very sad day for football and football fans, which we all are, when we lose a special person like this. 'Alfredo was the best Real Madrid player in history - winning five consecutive European Cups - and one of the greatest of all time. 'Rest in peace Alfredo.' Yohan Cruyff tweeted: 'I have always had a good friendship over the years with Alfredo Di Stefano. We have lost a good man and a great footballer. RIP, my friend.' Sir Bobby Charlton told manutd.com : I was deeply saddened to hear the news of Alfredo Di Stefano's passing. As one of the stars of the legendary Real Madrid team, I think Alfredo was one of the best players I ever came across and an extremely intelligent footballer. ‘He was somebody I really respected, having watched him from the stands at the Bernabeu and then played against him. I have many fond memories of my time with Alfredo and feel privileged to be able to call him a good friend. The footballing world has lost a great player and a great man. ‘I'd like to send my condolences on behalf of everybody at Manchester United to his family and our friends at Real Madrid.’ Gary Lineker tweeted: ‘Alfredo Di Stefano has died. One of the greatest players ever. Scored in 5 successive European Cup finals. A feat never to be matched. #RIP’ David De Gea: ‘A sad day for the world of football. One of the greatest has passed away. RIP Don Alfredo di Stefano.’ Diego Simeone tweeted: ‘Don Alfredo has left us, one of the greats of world football. Farewell maestro.’ Manchester United tweeted: ‘We’re sad to hear @RealMadrid legend Alfredo Di Stefano has passed away. The thoughts of everybody at #mufc are with his family and the club.’ Barcelona tweeted: 'FC Barcelona expresses its condolences for the death of Alfredo Di Stefano, honorary president of Real Madrid. Rest in peace ' Iker Casillas tweeted: ‘RiP Don Alfredo, the greatest. A . Madrid legend, you will always be with you. The MAESTRO will always be . remembered.’ Sepp Blatter: 'Sad to learn of Di Stefano’s passing, the most complete player I’ve seen. My favourite player. A legend is gone. RIP'. Juan Mata: RIP Alfredo di Stéfano. One of the greatest has passed away. My condolences to his family and friends. Pele added: 'He was a trailblazer, and most of all, he was a legend of the game. God rest his soul. 'Today, the openness between Latin American players and European clubs is very much due to the work of Alfredo Di Stéfano.

"When Arsene Wenger turned down the opportunity to sign former Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas for £30m, many Gunners fans thought their boss had lost it. Having seen transfer window after transfer window with little impact until late August, it’s hard to blame them. But as Arsenal close in on Alexis Sanchez for the exact same fee, Wenger’s decision has been vindicated. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Alexis Sanchez freestyle during Chile training . On his way: Sanchez left his holiday early and landed in London to sign for Arsenal . London calling: But Spain midfielder Cesc Fabregas moved to Chelsea, not Arsenal . The Barcelona forward is expected to seal his switch to north London as soon as a deal is finalised between Barca and Liverpool for Luis Suarez, with Spanish reports suggesting the lure of the French boss was the main factor for Sanchez. Wenger is said to have ‘seduced’ (steady on) Sanchez in a private meeting in Brazil, where he has been commentating for French television during the World Cup. When pictures leaked of the 64-year-old playing football on the beach in Brazil while Manchester United and Chelsea signed the likes of Luke Shaw and Diego Costa, social media went into overdrive. Was this going to be another summer where transfer targets come and go? Would Abou Diaby again be classed as a new signing? Not this time. There was a plan. Relief: Arsene Wenger celebrates winning the FA Cup in May and may be celebrating again now . Even in the imminent arrival of Mathieu Debuchy Arsenal are bringing in a proven replacement for Bacary Sagna, but it is that star striker that fans crave. The £40million plus £1 bid for Suarez last year signalled Wenger’s intent to sign a leading goalscorer to partner or play around Olivier Giroud. And in Sanchez, Arsenal may well be getting the next best thing. The Chilean operates up front for his country in a 3-5-2 formation, snapping at the heels of defenders, not giving them a moment's rest. Supporting cast: Frenchman Olivier Giroud cut an isolated figure up front for Arsenal at times last season . Acting as the focal point of their attack, Sanchez also drops back to start moves and create for his team-mates; similar to the role Lionel Messi takes up at Barcelona. Sanchez was told by Udinese team-mates before his move to La Liga that the Premier League suited his style more, but his time in Spain can only be classed as a success. Thirty-nine goals from 83 appearances in the league during his three-year stay is one thing, but it is his unselfish movement - either as a No 9 or winger - that helped Messi to flourish. Versatile: The energetic Sanchez is capable of playing in a number of attacking positions for Arsenal . Giroud, Theo Walcott and possibly Loic Remy may not be who Sanchez is used to playing around, but he has proved before he can do it on his own. If he can combine the qualities he has shown with Chile and Barcelona, there’s no limit for the 25-year-old in England. And you can thank Wenger for his arrival.","Alexis Sanchez set to sign for Arsenal in £30million deal .

According to research by German analyst Dr. Peter Rohlmann, Brazil's poster boy Neymar Jr. is the next biggest earner at the tournament, pulling in an estimated £9.5m a year from Nike. Despite England’s woeful tournament, three England players make the top 10 list, with Wayne Rooney, Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard all commanding in the region of £3m a year from their sponsors. Disgraced Uruguay striker Luis Suarez also rakes in £3m a year, from his deal with adidas, however this may be jeopardised after he was caught biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini during their Group D clash on Tuesday. FIFA have opened disciplinary proceedings against the 27-year-old who could be hit with a long-term ban following his antics in Natal. On the compiled list Rohlmann said: ‘The top footballers have learned that their face and their reputation can be marketed very well for advertising of products and companies. As the most popular sport in the world, football is in focus before and during major tournaments like the World Cup.’ The research also estimated that kit manufacturers have spent an estimated total of £100m on boot deals with the players on show at the World Cup.

"Reigning champion Andy Murray was back at Wimbledon on Tuesday as he prepared for his second-round match against Blaz Rola. Murray was joined by his coach Amelie Mauresmo as he fine-tuned his game ahead of his second-round game on Wednesday. The 2013 winner brushed aside David Goffin 6-1, 6-4, 7-5 in the opening match on Centre Court on Monday. Meanwhile, Tim Henman hopes Murray’s partnership with new coach Mauresmo will prove to be a long-term arrangement. In action: Andy Murray practiced at Wimbledon with his coach Amelie Mauresmo on Tuesday . Stretch: Murray was put through his paces on the practice courts at SW19 on Tuesday . Murray has hired the Frenchwoman initially for the grass-court season but both have already stated their intention to work together for longer. Mauresmo has so far been even more of a high-profile appointment than her predecessor Ivan Lendl, who guided Murray to his first two grand slam titles in their two and a half years together. Henman told Press Association: 'I think it’s certainly an interesting choice. I think the timing of it is not that straightforward, coming in at this time of year, trying to build that relationship when the eyes of the world are on them both. 'But I certainly do hope it works, because the continuity for him is really important, so I think they should stick together for a good while now. Chopping and changing I don’t think is so good for him in the long-run, so fingers crossed it works out well.' Backing: Murray won his first match against David Goffin in straight sets on Monday . Lighter moment: The Frenchwoman shows off her football skills (left) and shares a joke with Murray (right) Task: The British No 1 will take on Blaz Rola in his second-round match on Wednesday . Murray’s decision to choose a female coach, the highest-profile male player ever to do so, has been the talk of tennis over the past two weeks. Most people have been positive about the appointment but there have been dissenters, most notably fellow former Wimbledon champion Virginia Wade. 'The only things he can control are preparation and performance,' said Henman. 'What’s been talked about in the press, on the television and radio, people’s opinions on his new coach, he can’t control that, so there’s no point in worrying about that. 'Coming back as defending champion, it’s massively exciting for everyone. I think the draw’s been favourable to him, there are a few tricky ones out there, but on the whole he’s got a pretty good section. Victory: Murray celebrates his 6-1, 6-4, 7-5 victory over Goffin on Centre Court on Monday . Like what you see? Mauresmo was all smiles in Murray's box on Centre Court on Monday . 'But again that means nothing - he’s got to go out and earn that favourable draw. He was able to do that last year and hopefully he can get on a roll again this year.' Murray's second-round opponent Rola, 23, only began playing on the tour full-time this season after studying at university in America and broke into the top 100 for the first time last month. The Slovenian cited playing Ward at Queen’s two weeks ago as his biggest match before Wimbledon and the prize of playing the home champion gave him an extra incentive in his first-round match against Pablo Andujar.

"'Still life, Vase with Daisies and Poppies' could raise up to £30million in a Sotheby's auction this autumn . A 'beautiful and poignant' still life painted by Vincent Van Gogh just weeks before his suicide is expected to fetch up to £30million when it goes on auction this autumn. 'Still life, Vase with Daisies and Poppies' has been described as the most important painting of its kind to go on the market in two decades. It was produced by the Dutch artist in 1890 at the house of his close friend Dr. Gachet in Auvers-sur-Oise, Paris - not long before he shot himself in the chest with a revolver, aged 37. Van Gogh painted just a few hundred works in his career, the majority of which are now displayed in museums. The painting will be sold by auction house Sotheby's in New York on November 4. Simon Shaw, co-head of Impressionist and modern art at Sotheby's, described the work as 'beautiful' and 'vibrant', capturing 'the intensity of the artist at the height of his mania, only weeks before his tragic end.' He said the Dutch artist's early death meant his works were in 'radically diminished supply'. He added: 'Unlike Monet and Picasso, who were very productive artists with long, prolific careers, Van Gogh only painted for a very short time.' The artist is believed to have suffered from bipolar disorder, where manic episodes of high energy and creativity succumbed to spells of depression. Mr Shaw describes the painting as 'particularly poignant' because Van Gogh picked the flowers for the picture from the meadows where he is thought to have shot himself the following month. Van Gogh was constantly broke and relied on his brother for funds and supplies of paint, brushes and canvas. The painting is thought to have been first owned by Dr Gachet, to whom Van Gogh offered it as payment in kind for his treatment. Vincent Van Gogh, pictured here in a self-portrait, only produced a few hundred paintings in his career before shooting himself . Vincent Van Gogh, pictured here in his 1886 work 'Self-Portrait with Pipe', only produced a few hundred paintings in his career before shooting himself . The 'beautiful and poignant' painting will be auctioned by Sotheby's in New York (above) on November 4 . It later became one of the first of his works to arrive in the US in the 1920s and was gifted to the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York. Sotheby's said the painting is being sold from 'an important European collection' which had held the picture for more than two decades. Van Gogh's portrait of his friend and physician Dr. Gachet still holds the auction record for the most expensive Van Gogh painting, having sold at Christie's New York in May 1990 for more than £50million. Other significant Van Gogh works that have raised huge sums at auction include 'L'Arlésienne, Madame Ginoux' which fetched around £25million in 2006.","'Still life, Vase with Daisies and Poppies' will be sold at New York Sotheby's .

"Ivan Joe D'Angelo, 39, shot Wade Vandenberg, 27, in the forehead from a window after noticing him trying to break into his Melbourne factory . A Melbourne man who gunned down a burglar at his factory while drunk and high on marijuana has been jailed for eight years. Ivan Joe D'Angelo, 39, shot Wade Vandenberg, 27, in the forehead from a window in the loft of his Thomastown factory in Melbourne's north after waking to find three men trying to break through his gate. Mr Vandenberg and two of his friends had been attempting to steal an engine part for his car when he was gunned down, according to the ABC. Victorian Supreme Court Justice Lex Lasry said D'Angelo should have reached for his phone to call police, rather than a gun. 'You must've realised even given the amount of alcohol and marijuana you consumed that what you were doing was extremely dangerous,' Justice Lasry told D'Angelo on Thursday. In the hours before shooting Mr Vandenberg on March 28 last year D'Angelo, an experienced shooter, drank up to 42 bottles of beer and smoked 68 bongs of marijuana. But Justice Lasry said D'Angelo was not seeking trouble, rather it had come to him when he committed his crime. Part of D'Angelo's defence was that he was not aware that his firearm was loaded when he shot Mr Vandenberg. The court heard that D'Angelo drank up to 42 bottles of beer and smoked 68 bongs of marijuana in the hours before shooting Mr Vandenberg last year . Despite noting that he was unlikely to reoffend, Justice Lasry said: 'No reasonable person should ever point a gun at another person and pull the trigger.' Justice Lasry sentenced D'Angelo to eight years in prison for the manslaughter of Mr Vandenberg with a minimum of four and a half years. A jury in August found D'Angelo not guilty of murder but he pleaded guilty to manslaughter. He was jailed for eight years with a minimum for four and half for manslaughter in the Victorian Supreme Court (pictured)","Wade Vandenberg, 27, was attempting to steal an engine part from a factory with two other men when he was killed .

"Brazil supporters allegedly set off fireworks outside the Colombia team hotel at 4am on the night before their crucial World Cup quarter-final clash. This is just the latest example of the dark arts which the Brazilians plan to employ as they bid to win their sixth World Cup on home soil.

Scolari . has done everything possible to shield his inexperienced squad - only . six of whom have previously played at the World Cup finals - from the . combined weight of the hopes and desires of 200million football mad . local fans, and the country’s glorious World Cup-winning heritage. But . a string of underwhelming performances, including near-elimination . against Chile last Saturday, have pushed Scolari and his team close to . breaking point - and closer to paranoia. 'We’re being true gentlemen, and extremely polite, with the foreigners. It’s time to change our approach a little…we will no longer be the target of attacks from coaches, players and the foreign press,' Scolari growled after the game. He was referring to some violent Chilean challenges, notably from Arturo Vidal, including one that left Neymar nursing a dead leg in the days after the game. Brazil’s technical director Carlos Alberto Parreira, meanwhile, enraged by a number of controversial decisions by English referee Howard Webb, was seeing enemies everywhere. Emotional: Scolari embraces star man Neymar following Brazil's penalty shoot-out victory over Chile . Tears: Brazil's players have wept regularly during the tournament so far and must check their emotions . VIDEO Fully fit Neymar points to Ronaldo inspiration . 'If . there’s a conspiracy… then it’s against Brazil, and not in our favour. The idea that we might win the hexa (a sixth world title) is bothering . someone. And it’s only going to get worse as the tournament goes on,' he . muttered darkly on Saturday night. Scolari later echoed Parreira’s . thoughts in a private meeting with Brazilian journalists during the . week. Brazil, . however, have not shown a great deal of stomach for the fight in this . World Cup, at times looking more like Roland Browning than Gripper . Stebson. Thiago Silva was in tears before the opening game against Croatia, Neymar cried during the anthem before the Mexico match, and Julio Cesar had a weepy moment both before and after the penalty shoot-out against Chile. Then, after the same game, Silva revealed that he had asked 'God and Felipão' if he could be spared the ordeal of taking a penalty. If push literally does come to shove, will Brazil be able to show their mean side? Possibly, although none of this team has a particularly strong reputation as a Nigel de Jong or Jermaine Jones type enforcer. Luiz Gustavo, the team’s best tackler, is suspended for the Colombia game, and Thiago Silva leads through example rather than chest-beating. On the other hand, a number of Brazilians - including Ramires, Fernandinho, Dani Alves, Hulk and David Luiz have appeared near the top of the Champions League most fouls committed table in recent years. Absent: Luis Gustavo is Brazil's best tackler but he will miss the tie with Colombia through suspension . Tackler: David Luiz commits a lot of fouls .

Embrace: Brazil heroes Julio Cesar and David Luiz getting emotional in their celebrations . Favourites: Host nation Brazil have regularly been tipped to win the World Cup this summer . Luiz made negative headlines for over the top challenges on both Stoke’s Jonathan Walters and FC Basel’s Philipp Degen while playing for Chelsea, but the Brazil player with the worst reputation for on-field violence is undoubtedly full-back Marcelo. After the Real Madrid defender’s two-footed lunge on Thomas Muller at the end of the 2012 Champions League semi-final first leg, the Bayern player said 'he was out to get me,' while a reckless scissor tackle on Cesc Fabregas in the 2011 Spanish Super Cup final against Barcelona sparked a mass brawl. Then there is Neymar. Judging by the elbow that landed in the face of Luka Modric during Brazil’s opening game against Croatia, the youngster on whom Brazil’s World Cup hopes rest has clearly not lost the talent for winding-up opponents that he enjoyed in his youth. After the Barcelona star swore at his teammates and coach during a game for Santos in 2010, experienced Brazilian manager René Simões said that Brazilian football 'was creating a monster'. Aggressive: Full-back Marcelo (left) has been known to commit bad and cynical fouls in the past . Contrast: Chile players forlorn whilst Brazil's stars celebrate following penalty shoot-out . Team talk: Scolari talks to his players during training on Thursday ahead of the clash with Colombia . That was a long time ago, and Neymar can perhaps be forgiven the impetuousness of youth. But South American football has a long tradition of upholding the darker arts of the game, particularly in the Copa Libertadores, the continent’s Champions League, where grounds are often small and cramped, and pitches in poor quality. 'When you play in the Copa Libertadores, if you go to Paraguay, Argentina and Ecuador, as you approach the stadium you get attacked from all sides with stones, sticks and posts,' said Fernandinho last year.

"An elderly lady diagnosed with dementia sold her house to pay for an 18 month stay in a specialist care home - only to find out there was nothing wrong with her. Winnie Hill, 88, was left distraught after doctors told her she was suffering from Alzheimer's and needed round the clock care. The frail pensioner didn't think she was ill but agreed to sell her home in Plymouth, Devon, so she could move into a specialist medical facility. Scroll down for video . Misdiagnosis: Winnie Hill, 88, was left distraught after doctors told her she was suffering Alzheimer's and needed round the clock care . Her weight plummeted and she described the experience as like living in a 'prison' - but her confused family could see no signs of the dreaded condition. They pushed for a second diagnosis and were left stunned when another doctor rubbished the original diagnosis and said Mrs Hill wasn't suffering from dementia at all. She has since moved out of the home but her family say she suffered a devastating 18 month ordeal at the hands of the errors made to her care. Mrs Hill was given the devastating diagnosis of dementia in early 2013 when she showed signs of cognitive impairment. Her daughter, Katherine Hicks, trusted experts who recommended she move into a care home with a dementia wing. In order to pay for it, she had to sell her mother's house. Over the next few months she watched as her mother became withdrawn, unhappy and stopped eating. Ms Hicks said: 'She was feeling like she was in a prison and isolated. I think she was angry as well and didn't know how to express herself. 'Everyone was looked after really well but I saw things I didn't want to see - and worried that was what my mum was going to be like - it was really hard. 'She stopped eating and started losing weight. I decided I had to had to find out what was going on.' Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) causes a slight but noticeable and measurable decline in cognitive abilities, including memory and thinking skills. The changes that are serious enough to be noticed by the individuals experiencing them or to other people, but not severe enough to interfere with daily life or independent living. Because the changes caused are not severe enough to affect daily life, a person with MCI does not meet diagnostic guidelines for dementia. However, those with MCI have an increased risk of eventually developing Alzheimer's or another type of dementia. On the other hand, not all people with MCI get worse and some eventually get better. The second doctor diagnosed Mrs Hill with mild cognitive impairment - a less serious condition often brought on by stress or depression. Crucially, patients can eventually recover and it does not necessarily lead to dementia. Experts say the condition can be mistaken for dementia because there are no definitive clinical tests for the disease. Mrs Hill said she was shocked to hear she had Alzheimer's and hated being constantly monitored by medical staff inside the home. She said: 'I was upset because I didn't realise there was anything wrong with me. I felt normal I didn't understand why the doctor would say that. 'I didn't like it much. It's as though they were watching over me and I didn't need watching.' Over a year later, miserable and frustrated, she pushed her daughter to seek a second opinion. She told the BBC programme Inside Out: 'A doctor came in to see me and said: ""I don't know why they've put you in here. You don't need to be here because you don't have Alzheimer's"".' She claims the doctor added there was nothing wrong with her. Mrs Hill is now furious at the way she was treated. She said: 'I got very angry. I'm not accepting this, I don't think it's right they should treat me like this.' Her daughter added: 'It makes you feel like you want to scream and shout and somebody - but I'm not sure who I'm meant to scream and shout at.' Mrs Hill is now living in a home where she is much happier. However a second doctor diagnosed Mrs Hill with mild cognitive impairment - a less serious condition often brought on by stress or depression. By this point, she had sold her home . Dementia affects an estimated 670,000 people in England and Wales but experts say 350,000 of those remained undiagnosed and without access to support. A spokeswoman for NHS England said misdiagnosis rates are not recorded. Dementia specialist Dr Nick Cartwell called for the data to be collected, adding: 'I think Winnie's story is a devastating story that none of us would want to see happen in the health service. 'But it's a feature of the way that we make a diagnosis of dementia. There is no absolute diagnostic test - it is based on the balance of probabilities.' 'We still don't understand how many people in our community have dementia. We have a rough idea but we still don't really understand it. 'Having an idea of the risk of pushing for that diagnosis would be a useful reality check for the government and medical profession.' The Department of Health has declined to comment on her case but insists that £90m is being spent annually on fighting dementia.","Winnie Hill, 88, was distraught after doctors told her she had Alzhiemer's .

"Teenage winger Callum Lancaster continued his blazing start to his Super League career with a hat-trick of tries on his home debut but in-form Warrington made sure there was no happy return to the KC Stadium for Hull as they went down 24-18. The 17-year-old scored all of his side's tries to take his tally to eight in just four appearances as Hull appeared in front of their own fans for the first time in two months. However, the KC Stadium is a happy hunting ground for the Wolves, who have not lost there since 2007, and they ground out an eighth successive win to maintain their surge up the table. Blazing start: Hull's Callum Lancaster scored a hat-trick of tries during Friday's defeat to Warrington Wolves . Hull lost scrum-half Richard Horne with concussion after only five minutes but Aaron Heremaia proved a useful replacement and they opened the scoring with a penalty from teenage stand-off Jordan Abdull. The visitors struggled most with the wet ball and Hull punished a fumble by hooker Micky Higham on 17 minutes, with Abdull kicking the loose ball on for Lancaster to open his account. Most of the Warrington fans failed to reach Hull because of the closure of the M62 but, as their numbers gradually swelled, so their team began to make their presence felt too. Centre Joel Monaghan collected Gareth O'Brien's high kick on the last tackle but was prevented from grounding the ball and Hull full-back Jamie Shaul was forced to scramble to deny stand-off Chris Bridge after he had charged down Abdull's attempted clearance kick. The Wolves' first try eventually fell to loose forward Stefan Ratchford but the architect was full-back Matty Russell with a determined 60-metre run in which he fended off a host of would-be tacklers to create the position for Monaghan to supply the final pass. Bridge's conversion tied the scores but Joe Westerman edged Hull back in front with a penalty before Warrington struck again in the final minute of the first half. O'Brien came up with a perfectly-weighted grubber kick that bounced kindly for centre Ryan Atkins to touch down, with Bridge adding the goal to make it 12-8 at the break. Bridge extended the lead with a penalty early in the second half, clearly sensing that points would be hard to come by in the difficult conditions. Both sides continued to fritter away possession and Hull took full advantage of Wolves winger Gene Ormsby's knock-on from a scrum on his own 20-metre line. Skipper Gareth Ellis got over the line only to lose his grip on the ball but then sent out a superb pass for Lancaster to finish decisively to claim his second try. Westerman's missed kick left his side trailing by two points and they fell further behind on the hour when Ben Harrison took O'Brien's pass to charge over for the visitors' third try, to which Bridge added his fourth goal. And there was no way back for the home side when Monaghan split their defence on 66 minutes for Bridge to get Ormsby over for their fourth try. Hull made the most of another handling error from the visitors to get Lancaster over for his third try three minutes from the end and Westerman's touchline conversion cut the gap to just six points but it came too late to affect the result.","Callum Lancaster continues excellent start to Super League career with hat-trick at the KC Stadium .

"FIFA is investigating after photographs circulated of fans wearing black face makeup at Germany’s match against Ghana. Images posted on social media networks showed two men, appearing to be Germany fans, with blackened faces in the Fortaleza stadium on Saturday.

FIFA says its disciplinary committee is in discussion to . open a case. ‘We always take any evidence or submissions to our disciplinary committee. It is the disciplinary committee that will meet,’ a spokeswoman told The Guardian. ‘If they see any grounds they will open proceedings. Then it is up to the disciplinary commission to take the decision.’ FIFA holds national football federations responsible for their fans’ behaviour inside stadiums. Football fans took to Twitter to show their anger towards the fans who decided to paint their faces. One tweeted: 'World Cup Officials cannot allow blatant racism like this Blackface BS happen at the games. German fans at Ghana game,' while another said: 'How does Germany pay homage to Ghana? By being racist in Blackface of course!' In a second incident, a man ran onto the pitch in the second half of the 2-2 draw. Disruption: A fan stops play by running onto the pitch during Germany's 2-2 draw with Ghana on Saturday . Moved on: The pitch invader was apprehended by Ghana's Sulley Muntari and removed from the field . Germany has a tradition of blacking . up, often for theatrical purposes, that despite its burgeoning ethnic . minority population and the fact that it is now unthinkable in the UK . and the U.S., still continues to this day. In . January last year, German Chancellor Angela Merkel courted controversy . after she posed for pictures with carol singers who had applied black . face paint to pose as the Three Kings. It . was part of the Sternsinger, or star singer, tradition of . Dreikönigstag, the Three Kings' Day, when children go from house to . house in groups of four and sing carols for charity. It is tradition that one of the kings is black.Prior . to that, the Olivier award-winning playwright Bruce Norris in 2012 . banned a Berlin theatre from staging one of his plays after learning . that it intended to 'black up' a white actress for a lead role. In . an open letter he called on fellow playwrights to boycott any German . theatre which still practices what he described as an 'asinine . tradition'. 'Whatever . rationale the German theatre establishment might offer for their . brazenly discriminatory practice is of no interest to me,' he wrote. 'For, . as little power as we playwrights have, we always retain one small . power and that is the power to say no. To say, no thank you, I’d rather . not have my work performed in Germany, today, under those conditions.' The shirtless fan, who is reportedly from Poland, had an email address and telephone number written on his back. Ghana's . former Portsmouth and Sunderland midfielder Sulley Muntari, who currently . plays for AC Milan, apprehended the pitch invader before he was detained by . stewards and removed from the field. Brazil’s organising committee spokesman Saint-Clair Milesi said the man was detained by local authorities. Meanwhile, FIFA have also been contacted by the Fare network relating to discriminatory chanting at the World Cup. Allegations . of the use of improper language by supporters at games between Brazil . and Mexico and Cameroon and Mexico have been passed on to FIFA by Fare - . the organisation in place to tackle discrimination in football. The . allegations centre around the use of the word 'puto' which translates . into 'whore' and has been heard in games in Fortaleza and Natal.

"Super-tall Olympic hopeful Jade Slavin is having the last laugh on school bullies who made cruel jibes about her height. Classmates would risk a kicking now if they still teased 6ft 2ins Jade over her stature. University graduate Jade, 21, has mixed brawn, brains and beauty to become one of Britain's best exponents of the ancient Korean martial art of taekwondo. Scroll down for video . Olympic hopeful Jade Slavinwas was bullied at school over her height, but has now become one of Britain's best exponents of the ancient Korean martial art of taekwondo . She is also a model and aspiring beauty queen after reaching the finals of last year's Miss Earth and recently signing for Manchester agency, Maverick Models. However, the Beswick-based fighter will be seeing less of the catwalk and more of the world's taekwondo mats as she chases her Rio 2016 Olympics dream for the next 18 months. After just four months as a full-time member of the GB Academy on Ten Acres Lane in Manchester, she has been selected for next weekend's prestigious World Taekwondo Grand Prix in the city, featuring 256 of the planet's best in the sport. Jade said: 'It was hard at school and I used to get bullied a few times for being tall and skinny. 'That's one of the reasons I got into taekwondo, because my dad thought it would be a good idea to learn how to defend myself. Standing tall at 6ft 2ins has also helped Jade to be scouted for a local modelling agency . 'A friend of my dad's friends did it and one day I bumped in to him and he had his taekwondo suit (dobok) on. 'I was like ""dad, what is he doing? Why he is he wearing that suit?"" 'Dad just said he does taekwondo, like the Bruce Lee films. 'I just wanted to have a go straight away and I loved it.' Jade, who became national champion in Manchester last month, took up the sport aged nine. A few years later, she added another string to her bow - modelling. Jade has modeled for Atos, the clothing website and other fashion shows . She said: 'I began modelling when I was 11, sending photos to agencies, but it wasn't until I was about 16 when things started to roll. 'I got asked to do modelling for Atos, the clothing website, and other fashion shows. 'I am signed up to Maverick Models but I want to focus on my taekwondo as the castings are usually during the week when I have training.' Last year she entered her first beauty pageants, reaching the final of Miss Sunderland and the grand final of Miss Earth. She said: 'I started modelling to boost my confidence and prove people wrong. Hopefully, I am doing that now.' Jade is hoping to represent Britain in taekwondo at Rio 2016 . Jade had just completed a three-year sports science degree at Northumbria University when the call came for her to move to Manchester to join the GB Academy. She said: 'I was excited and surprised when I was told because I thought I was too old - most of the girls are 18 or 19. 'I did have trials when I was 16, but the last stage and boot camp were on at the same time as my exams. 'I did my exams instead and didn't think I would get another chance to prove myself, but I am here now. 'I've finished my studies and while I still have my modelling to fall back on, my main goal is taekwondo and trying to focus on Rio 2016.'","Jade Slavin, 21, from Beswick is one of UK's best at taekwondo .

Straight away she responds saying: 'Ring ding ding.' Daisy is also quick to identify the noises made by a V8 ('Vroooooom!'), a turbo ('Whaach!'). The funniest part of the video comes when Mr Witt asks Daisy: 'And when we beat somebody at the lights, what do we say?' 'Chopped!' Daisy answers her father. Since posting the video online Mr Witt, a Holden enthusiast, has been overwhelmed by its popularity. Mr Witt, who is a pastor at Hunter Bible Church, said he started teaching Daisy how to make car noises in the bath but never imagined his daughter would eventually go viral.

Mr Witt said Daisy was now building up a repertoire of engine sounds. 'She knows tractor and rotary and we're working on Volkswagen,' he said. But Mr Witt said he didn't teach Daisy to say 'Chopped' intentionally, she just picked up the word by imitating him in the car. 'It just kind of happened in the backseat of the car, if we overtook someone I just said ""chopped"",' he said. 'And she started saying it all by herself, if we overtook someone she'd say chopped.

"Alastair Cook shuffled a little too far across to the off side, stayed fatally a little too far back and saw a gentle delivery from Mohammed Shami flick his thigh pad and take the top of leg-stump. It was a cruel yet somehow inevitable end to another miserable day for the England captain. If the dismissal of Cook came almost in freakish fashion and with more than an element of bad luck then it seemed almost pre-ordained after a last-wicket stand of such frustration for England that it would have frazzled their captain. The last thing Cook needed when he is fighting for his captaincy life was a partnership that lasted two and a half hours between two  absolute rabbits in Shami and  Bhuvneshwar Kumar that sucked all remaining life from England. VIDEO Scroll down to see Broad joke he came close to handing the ball to the groundsman . Oh no! Things go from bad to worse for Alastair Cook as he is bowled for just five . Long walk: Cook walks off as he is out for just five runs . Early breakthrough: Mohammed Shami celebrates the wicket of Cook early in the England innings . VIDEO Broad remaining optimistic after tough second day . Until then . England, with a burst of four wickets that cost just two runs, were very . much in this first Investec Test and had done everything possible to . keep India within reach on a pitch that could have been made for the . visitors. Yet . once Shami, Test average of 3.33, and Kumar, without a half-century to . his name, started  milking the England attack on a Trent Bridge wicket . that simply got lower and slower then Cook’s misery was destined to . continue. This . was nothing like the woeful captaincy on the fourth day at Headingley . that allowed Angelo Mathews and Rangana Herath to guide Sri Lanka to a . position from where they were to snatch a series victory at the very . last gasp. Cook . had been pro-active with his field placings and bowling changes . throughout India’s long vigil — almost too funky at times — and the . bowlers who had let him down at Leeds had given their all in anything . but home conditions. Yet . that painful stand of 111, an Indian last-wicket record against . England, lifted their team from a below-par 346 for nine to 457 all out . and the pressure had built 10-fold on a captain in need of a break. Cook . had only 10 minutes to unscramble his brain and try to get through the . 17 overs that remained on this second day of a series that will make or . break his leadership. As it turned out he could not  survive four of them. Cook, . in common with most of England’s batsmen, prefers the back foot and . Steve Birks’ sub- continental pitch was never going to favour an opener . who has not recorded a century in 25 innings and has failed to score . more than 50 in 14 innings at Trent Bridge. The . first ball of the England innings from Kumar was floated down at no . more than 78 miles per hour and swung in at Cook who got an inside edge . onto it and guided it for a single on the leg-side. Nervy but at least . he was on his way. Trudging off: Cook walks off at the end of the India innings . Tail wagging: Mohammed Shami plays a shot at the end of the India innings . Then, . in the second over, Shami strayed onto Cook’s legs and was punched . confidently through square leg for four, his favourite shot perhaps . giving him hope that he may just come through the most torrid . examination of his mettle. It . was not to be. That was as good as it got for Cook who is finding ways . of getting out to balls that would never have troubled him when he was . scoring each of his 25 Test hundreds for England. Luck has clearly . deserted him too. As his 10th ball somehow hit the stumps, and the . realisation of the extent of his plight dawned on him, this  patriotic . Nottingham crowd showed their support with a warm, sympathetic round of . applause. Just . over a year ago Cook seemed destined to break every record in England’s . run-scoring book, but his professional world has fallen apart since . then and he will soon have to decide if he can carry on as both captain . and opener. There . has been nothing wrong with Cook’s leadership in this Test, and he . seems to have learned the lessons from Leeds, but if he is not scoring . runs at the top of the order then he is struggling to justify his place . at the helm of this side. Support for Cook among his team-mates and the ECB is absolute and his position will only be an issue if England lose this Test. Sam . Robson and Gary Ballance took England to the close without further . alarms and if they and the rest of England’s line-up bat big today and . tomorrow then it will give Cook vital breathing space over which to . consider his fate. Feeling down: Ian Bell looks lies on the floor as India pile on the runs . In the runs: Kumar and Shami  both celebrate reaching 50 for India . VIDEO Wicket is like back in India - Kumar . There is no appetite at the ECB to replace him as long as England do not go one down either here or at Lord’s next week. But . if they do and his barren run with the bat continues then Cook’s grasp . on the captaincy will weaken to a point where a change will become . almost inevitable. In the wickets: India batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni  is run out by a direct hit from James Anderson . Glorious day: A full house at Trent Bridge enjoy Day Two of the Test . The long hangover from England’s horror tour of Australia continues for Cook and Thursday was  perhaps his lowest point yet. Time is running out now for him to save his captaincy skin.

"Luke Shaw makes his England World Cup debut with a staggering £40million price tag hung on his head by Southampton. Manchester United thought they had a deal cued up at around £30million to take the prodigious teenage left back to Old Trafford to begin Louis van Gaal's rebuilding task. VIDEO Scroll down for Shaw: Transfer talk is not on my mind, I am focused on England . On the run: Luke Shaw and Chris Smalling during England training session on Monday . But new Saints boss Ronald Koeman has insisted he wants to do everything to keep the latest star product of the club's Academy at St Mary's. Shaw, who celebrates his 19th birthday in two weeks time, was also wanted by Chelsea after an outstanding season for Saints but they were put off by the likely transfer fee even before Koeman took charge. Now United, anxious to make a statement in the transfer market after failing to qualify for the Champions League for the first time since 1995, will have to decide how to react to Saints demands. Team talk: England's manager Roy Hodgson with the players on Monday . Koeman has already seen centre forward Rickie Lambert leave for Liverpool, who are also chasing new England star Adam Lallana, while centre-half Dejan Lovren has put in a transfer request. And he's demanded Saints play hardball over any other sales as the country's big clubs try to pick over their best players. For all Shaw's talent it is an astonishing price to ask for a left back who is still learning his trade, and has yet to play a competitive international. Call up: Shaw and Jack Wilshere will get the chance to shine against Costa Rica on Tuesday .

"World Cup star Bravo was unveiled at Nou Camp on Monday following move from Real Sociedad . Barca sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta was quizzed about Suarez transfer but was tight-lipped . Chile forward Sanchez is also wanted by Arsenal and Liverpool but club were giving nothing away . Barcelona were giving little away about the prospective transfers of Luis Suarez and Alexis Sanchez as they unveiled new goalkeeper Claudio Bravo at the Nou Camp on Monday. Barca have been in talks with Liverpool regarding Suarez, with media reports suggesting a fee in the region of £75million has been agreed for the Uruguay international, who is banned from all football related activity for four months after biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup, but is free to complete a medical in order to move clubs. Chile winger Sanchez, meanwhile, is being heavily linked with a move away from Barca with Liverpool and their Premier League rivals Arsenal both reportedly in the hunt for the 25-year-old.VIDEO Scroll down to watch Claudio Bravo's first press conference as Barcelona goalkeeper .

Put it there: Bravo with Barcelona's sports director Andoni Zubizarreta (left) and Barcelona's vice-president Jordi Mestre . However, sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta, speaking at the presentation of Sanchez's international colleague Bravo, remained tight-lipped about the developments surrounding both possible transfers. He said: 'We are working towards building the best squad possible before the transfer window shuts and it's positive that people (from the club) are travelling (in order to sign players) but it's important that we only communicate official deals. 'When we have reached one, we will announce it.' When asked about Sanchez, Zubizarreta added: 'There is nothing new to report. We will announce deals when they are done. Right now, we have two Chileans in our squad.' The other of those two Chileans, Bravo, said that Sanchez encouraged him to move to the Catalan club, but would not reveal whether the striker said he would be his team-mate next season. 'He told me that Barca was a marvellous club and that I had to take this opportunity and enjoy it,' said Bravo. 'But we didn't talk about being at Barcelona together, we were only focused on the World Cup.' The 31-year-old Bravo signed from Real Sociedad last month while still playing for Chile in the World Cup, in a four-year deal that the Catalan club confirmed was worth 12million euros (£9.5m). Bravo's transfer followed the arrival of 22-year-old German keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen at the end of May from Borussia Monchengladbach, also for a fee believed to be in the region of 12million euros. The club have brought in the duo to compensate for the departure of long-standing number one Victor Valdes and second-choice Jose Pinto, but the message at Bravo's presentation from both the player and Zubizarreta was that neither new keeper would be guaranteed a place in the team when the season starts. VIDEO Suarez departure would underline European dominance . Pointing the way: Luis Suarez is headed out of Liverpool in the direction of Barcelona . Red alert: Alexis Sanchez appears surplus to requirements at Barca and is a target of Arsenal and Liverpool . 'For me coming here is not a risk, it's a motivation,' said Bravo, who was the undisputed number one keeper at Real Sociedad and has 83 caps for Chile. 'I have never felt I had an advantage over anyone at any club or with Chile, quite the opposite. 'I think it's going to be very competitive here but that's not just the case for the goalkeepers, every player in the squad has to compete.' Bravo called his new team-mate Ter Stegen 'a young goalkeeper with enormous quality', and said he was not intimidated at the prospect of stepping into Valdes' shadow. 'I'm very proud to be able to play for Barcelona,' he said. 'At Real Sociedad the name of (Luis Miguel) Arconada was very present and here so is the name of Valdes, but I feel very strong and I believe in my ability. 'It's a tremendous challenge but I hope to be able to rise to it.' Former Barca and Spain number one Zubizarreta said of the goalkeeping situation: 'Ter Stegen knew that Bravo was coming. 'Every player knows that when they come to Barcelona they have to compete with the best players in the world.'","World Cup star Bravo was unveiled at Nou Camp on Monday following move from Real Sociedad .

"Right up to its last meaningful moments — the somewhat whimpering surrender of Wednesday’s final four games — Andy Murray’s reign as Wimbledon champion never went to plan. A lack of motivation last summer, spinal surgery in September, the loss of his coach in March, the long haul back without reaching a final — the fairytale of 2013 turned out to be shortlived. And then came Goldenballs Grigor Dimitrov to administer the last rites in a fashion few expected. The 23-year-old Bulgarian always possessed the means to make this difficult but the margin of 6-1, 7-6, 6-2 seemed unthinkable at the start of the day. VIDEO Scroll down for Grigor Dimitrov's quick fire questions at Wimbledon . Frustrated: Murray is out of Wimbledon after losing to Bulgarian youngster Dimitrov . Dreamland: Dimitrov celebrates beating defending Wimbledon champion Murray on Centre Court . High and low: Murray looks on after crashing out as Dimitov celebrates . Celebration time: Dimitov celebrates taking the scalp of the Wimbledon champion . Out of sorts: Murray looked far from his best against Dimitov . Roar: Murray looks frustrated as he loses a point to Dimitrov during their Wimbledon showdown . In control: Dimitov started far faster than Murray and raced into the lead . Having played as hard as a slab of Scottish granite in the opening four rounds Murray turned to mush. It took 77 years for a British man to win Wimbledon again and, with this particular match, you wanted to see more of a full-blooded scrap when it came to retaining the title. Of course the Bulgarian deserves huge credit for pulling off what should be a career-changing win, and the three magnificent points he played from 4-4 in the tiebreak to go two sets up were the stuff of great champions. We have waited years for a breakout performance from a younger player on the Centre Court, now two have come along in 24 hours with 19-year-old Nick Kyrgios and Dimitrov. When he went two sets up it was the same situation as in the quarter-final a year ago, when Murray looked like he was going to lay an egg against Fernando Verdasco of Spain. He rescued himself from a poor start then but against this calibre of grass-court player, with the confidence of the recent Queen’s Club title behind him, that was never likely. Perhaps we overestimated  Murray’s chances based on his first four matches and discounted too much the struggles of the past 12 months. What maybe hurt him most is not having banked any top 10 wins since beating Novak Djokovic here last year. The belief such victories bring was lacking at the first sign of a difficult challenge. What happened was actually part of a pattern of lame Grand Slam defeats for Murray. Shocked: The Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William do not know where to look as Murray went down in straight . Looking nervous: The Duchess of Cambridge looked on from the Royal Box at Wimbledon . Tough viewing: The Duchess of Cambridge looks on as Murray crashes out . Can't watch: The Duchess of Cambridge looks shocked as Murray crashes out . Disappointed: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge applaud at the end of the match . In the past four he has played well and then bombed without warning. Those defeats came against Stan Wawrinka at the US Open, Roger Federer in Australia, Rafael Nadal in Paris and now Dimitrov. Losing to any of them is no disgrace, but there has been a concerning element of acceptance each time. There will be some collateral damage from this hammering when it comes to Wimbledon. Murray had built up an aura about himself at the All England Club, having won 23 of his past 24 matches here from 2012, the one defeat being an honourable loss to Federer. That aura has been well and truly blown away. Small wonder that he spoke afterwards, encouragingly, about going away and working on much-needed improvements to his game. Deep into his career at 27 that is not going to be easy, but it is possible. Down and out: Murray was beaten in straight sets by Dimitrov . Beaten man: Murray had no answers to Dimitov's precision . Maybe next year: Murray missed the chance to make his third successive Wimbledon final . Murray would not be specific but one area is bound to be his second serve, which finally met someone capable of punishing it. You are simply not going to beat anyone of the highest calibre when winning only 31 per cent of the points after your first serve misses out. The expectation was that the quality of Murray’s return would  give him an edge but that was turned on its head, with Dimitrov  even sharper in this respect. The Bulgarian’s superiority when it came to trading backhands was also unexpected. This is the stroke that has looked most improved by Murray’s back surgery, but Dimitrov’s glorious, flowing, one-handed version proved the more reliable. The champion started well enough in creating a break point in the first game but then whacking his  forehand into the net was to prove expensive, as it immediately  settled the nerves of the younger man. Barely 20 minutes later Murray, who thereafter made the error of just waiting for mistakes that never came, was looking at his worst Wimbledon set since losing to David Nalbandian as an 18-year-old in 2005. Fan club: Murry's fans turned out in force to support the British No 1 . Looking good: Dimitrov dominated Murray in the first set winning it 6-1 . Making him work: Dimitov raced into a two set lead and looked in control . Bad day at the office: Having come through the first week of Wimbledon with flying colours Murray came unstuck . Not at his best: Murray was swept aside in just over two hours by Dimitov . His best chance of turning the match around came after being broken for 3-4 in the second when Dimitrov, with girlfriend Maria Sharapova nowhere to be seen, went through his only wobble of the match. Murray broke back and then got to 30-30 at 5-5 but could go no further. Two break points needed to be saved in his next game and then came the tiebreak, which was evenhanded until 4-4. That was when Dimitrov showed why he is ready to win this title. The next three points were magnificently executed under steam- hammer pressure, a ripped backhand pass followed by two well-judged forays to the net where he showed his volleying skills. A desultory double fault handed Dimitrov the break at 2-3 in the third and Murray never even made the Bulgarian sweat after that. A curiously flat performance leaves Murray with a reduced  ranking, no titles and certainly no statue at the All England Club.  Perhaps this will be the easiest place from which to rebuild. No answer: Murray could not reproduce the form he had earlier in the tournament . On the run: Dimitrov was on top of Murray from the start . Marching on: Dimitov was at his best on Centre Court to beat Murray . Support act: Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears watches supports from the player's box . Face in the crowd: Murray was supported by comedian Michael McIntyre on Centre Court . Watching on: Amelie Mauresmo saw Murray lose on Centre Court . Andy Murray lost the first set 6-1 in just 25 minutes as his run of 18 straight sets won at Wimbledon came to a tame end. It was his worst set since he lost the decider 6-1 to David Nalbandian during his Wimbledon debut in 2005. It helped Grigor Dimitrov to settle quickly in what was the biggest match of his career. The 2013 champion won just 31 per cent of second-serve points, while Dimitrov won 59 per cent. Murray’s second serve speed averaged just 86mph, 10mph less than Dimitrov. The Scot hit 12 unforced errors and only one winner with his normally reliable backhand. The poor side-spin slice he hit long to go a break down in the second set summed up his woes from that side. 32 - Dimitrov hit 32 winners on his way to victory, eight more than Murray. 5 - Murray hit five double faults, three of them coming in the third set. This defeat marks only the second time Murray has lost to a lower-ranked opponent at Wimbledon. He lost to then world No 6 Andy Roddick in the 2009 semi-finals. Dimitrov will now overtake Murray, who will slip to world No 10 or 11 when Monday’s new list is issued, his worst position since June 2008. Murray has still failed to beat a  top-10 player since his  victory over Novak Djokovic here 12 months ago.

It has been designed for landlords and hoteliers, but will also be available to homeowners - although, prices have not been announced. In addition to catching people smoking in businesses or houses, AirGuard's technology has been developed to stop the dangers of so-called third-hand smoke. Earlier this year, a study found that even after the cigarette has been extinguished, traces of smoke remain in carpets, furniture and dust. Researchers from York University said the maximum risk predicted from the third-hand smoke levels in a home where people have smoked previously equated to one extra cancer case per 1,000 of the population exposed.

"Greg Rusedski, crowned Sports Personality of the Year after finishing runner-up in the 1997 US Open, is under scrutiny in his role as coach at the Lawn Tennis Association. This follows the upset around Rusedski being assigned to look after Britain’s highest-ranked teenager Kyle Edmund last April — yet not being with him in the build-up to Wimbledon, where his charge exited in straight sets in the first round. Rusedski was playing an exhibition tournament in Liverpool in the four days leading up to 19-year-old Edmund’s big moment at the Championships. Keeping busy: Greg Rusedski playing an exhibition match in Liverpool in the lead up to Wimbledon . And there is now concern whether busy Rusedski, who has media commitments and is a regular on the seniors circuit, has sufficient time to coach Edmund. LTA chief executive Michael Downey said after Rusedski’s appointment: ‘It reflects very highly on Greg that he wanted to step up and take on this challenge.’ Yet neither Andy Murray nor Tim Henman were too impressed with the choice of Rusedski to guide Edmund, it is understood. Gone: Kyle Edmund suffered a straight sets first-round defeat by Austria's Andreas Haider-Maurer . An LTA spokeswoman said: ‘Greg agreed to take part in Liverpool well before he was appointed as Kyle’s coach. Our performance team are working to achieve a level of continuity for Kyle’s coaching situation.’ Meanwhile. Downey is believed to be paying Australian Bob Brett around £250,000 a year — not far short of the CEO’s own salary — to be director of player development when the LTA are involved in a nationwide cost-cutting process which has seen more than 30 jobs lost. However, Brett and Downey’s combined wages are still less then the obscene £640,000 a year the LTA were paying former CEO Roger Draper. .......................................................................... Chairman Greg Dyke works only part-time for the FA and was entitled to take up an invitation to Wimbledon’s Royal Box on Monday. But somehow it seemed wrong for Dyke to be enjoying lavish All England Club hospitality quite so soon after England’s footballers had let down the nation in Brazil, with the FA chief not prepared to discuss it. The LTA, who have a poor record with communications chief appointments, have once again, in their wisdom, given this crucial role to someone from outside tennis. There is a real need at the LTA for a top media operator to make the most of Andy Murray’s golden years. Yet Alex Mawer, recruited from tourism agency Visit England, is much more of a marketing specialist. LTA chief Michael Downey believes marketing is key to revitalising his organisation’s battered image. ..........................................................................

"Australian teacher Robert Scott is fighting for life in hospital and has racked up more than $1 million in medical bills after suffering a fractured skull during an attack on a California residential street. The 26-year-old and former champion rower from the NSW mid-north coast town of Pacific Palms has been in a coma and on life support for almost two months. He was a PE teacher at several Tamworth high schools before flying to Canada to work at the resort town of Banff. Robert Scott (right) and girlfriend Amy Jarvis in the intensive care ward at a California hospital. Mr Scott has been in a coma for two months after an attack on a US street . 'The doctors don't know if he will recover,' Robert's father, Stephen, told AAP. 'He is lucky to be alive. 'They say he's young and could make some kind of a recovery and we're just staying positive and want our Rob back.' Robert was flown on a Lear jet air ambulance from California to Sydney last week, where he remains in a coma and on life support in Royal North Shore Hospital. The flight added to the already extremely high medical bills he accumulated in intensive care at Fresno's Saint Agnes Medical Centre, despite having travel insurance. But the insurance company might not pay the bills because he was drunk when he was hit. He had a blood alcohol level of .24, but the Scotts deny alcohol played a role in the attack. They are frustrated the alleged assailant and admitted associate of Fresno's Bulldog gang, Gilbert Romero, has not been charged. The attack happened at about 9pm on August 17 in Fresno, a city 320 kilometres north of Los Angeles. Local Gilbert Romero was arrested nine days later, but was released without charge. Robert was walking with friend Helena Sordal along a Fresno street with an 18-pack of beer. What happened next is in dispute. The Australian teacher is fighting for life in hospital and has racked up more than $1 million in medical bills after suffering a fractured skull during an attack. He is pictured here with his father Stephen Scott . Ms Sordal said Robert spoke to a woman who was sitting with a young child in a car double parked on the wrong side of the road. Romero then allegedly ran from a nearby house and shouted, 'What are you doing to my girl?'. 'Robert had his hands down, backing away and said, 'I don't want any trouble',' Robert's father, recalling how Sordal described the incident, said. 'But the guy hit him.' Romero, however, alleged Robert shouted an expletive at the woman and child and took a swing at Romero but missed. He said he punched Robert in self-defence. Lieutenant Mark Salazar of the Fresno Police Department's murder-robbery unit said his unit will re-submit the case to the DA later this week. 'We hope when we re-submit it something will happen with the case,' Lt Salazar told AAP on Tuesday. Lt Salazar said Scott had been drinking alcohol from 11am up until the confrontation, which complicated the case. Mr Scott and his girlfriend Ms Jarvis before the brutal assault in Fresno, California . Scott's blood-alcohol reading was 0.24 and an officer who went to the scene said Sordal was so drunk they had to get her personal information from her passport because she was unable to tell them, according to police. 'What we do have is Robert was in the middle of the street, his friend Helena was carrying an 18-pack of beer, a car went around them and that contained Romero's girlfriend, his one-year-old son and his sister-in-law,' Lt Salazar said. 'The sister-in-law exited the car, went to the house where Gilbert Romero was in, as she was doing that she noticed Robert Scott yelling at Romero's girlfriend. 'She told Romero this, Romero went outside, he saw Robert Scott yelling obscenities at the girlfriend, his one-year-old son was crying and that's when he confronted Mr Scott.' Romero's witnesses told police Scott had a beer can in his hand, threw a half punch and Romero hit him once. However, Lt Salazar said the witnesses initially told police they did not know who Romero was. 'It is tough when there is no physical evidence, when you have one side and it's the suspect's side and they did lie initially,' Lt Salazar said. In deciding not to charge Romero, the DA pointed to Romero possibly acting in self-defence and Scott's intoxication, Lt Salazar said.","Australian teacher Robert Scott was attacked on a California street .

"Universal Studios has a sealed an agreement to open a £2bn theme park in Beijing, the culmination of a 13-year effort to enter China's fast-growing entertainment market. US theme park operators are rushing to build in China, where there are few high-quality parks and park revenues are growing rapidly as city dwellers spend more on entertainment and travel. The Beijing Universal theme park, to be developed with the state firm Beijing Tourism Group Co, will have China-themed attractions in addition to well-known ones based on Western brands like the Harry Potter series when it opens. Theme park: Chairman of Universal Parks and resorts Tom Williams, alongside Minion from the Despicable Me . Plans for the future: The projected £2bn development of Universal's Beijing theme park . Tom Williams, chairman and chief executive of Universal Parks and Resorts, told a news conference in Beijing that the park would also aim to draw visitors from outside China, while Hollywood director Steven Spielberg said on video that he would be participating in its design. 'There is Disneyland in Hong Kong, but there isn't really anything of equivalent quality of a tourist attraction on the mainland yet,' said James Roy, associate principle of China Market Research Group. 'It has a chance to be very successful.' Universal's Beijing development will rival Walt Disney's Shanghai plan (pictured) It will compete against rival Walt Disney Co, which is constructing a £2.8bn theme park set to be completed next year, as well as a £2bn entertainment complex that DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc and Chinese partners are working to finish by 2016. Both of those parks will be located in Shanghai. Universal declined to comment on an opening date but a local newspaper said the opening was slated for 2019. The Beijing theme park will feature Western themes such as Harry Potter, alongside Chinese developments . Universal Studios is set to add another theme park alongside its Singapore attraction . Universal Studios is part of NBCUniversal, a media and entertainment unit of Comcast Corp, the largest cable company in the US. It operates theme parks in Los Angeles, Orlando, Osaka and Singapore. Comcast reported £620m in total theme park income in 2013. Universal and Beijing Tourism Group (BTG) will create two joint-venture companies to build and manage the project. BTG will hold 70 per cent of the construction firm, while Universal will hold 70 per cent of the operating company. The park will be developed on about 300 acres  in eastern Beijing.

They said the Beijing park will include attractions from other Universal parks as well as new ones reflecting China's cultural heritage. The complex will eventually cover about 1,000 acres  and feature a Universal CityWalk entertainment zone and a Universal-themed resort hotel. It will be the third Universal park in Asia, with the others in Singapore and Osaka, Japan.","Theme park operators are rushing to enter China's fast-growing market .

"As much as $3 million in cash sent by Ghana's president was expected to arrive in Brazil on a plane Wednesday in a bid to appease members of the country's World Cup squad who are unhappy at being denied bonus payments. President John Dramani Mahama has been forced to personally intervene in the latest bonus row to hit African football, which has seriously disrupted Ghana's preparations for its decisive Group G game against Portugal on Thursday. Ghana midfielder Christian Atsu dismissed fears the team would boycott its final group game in Brasilia, which the Ghanaians need to win to stand any chance of reaching the second round. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the Ghana squad forget the feud and dance during training . Price: $3m in cash sent by Ghana's president was expected to arrive in Brazil to appease the World Cup squad . 'We are not going to say we are not going to play because of the money,' Atsu said. 'We love our nation and we are going to play for our nation.' Asked what the players will do with the appearance-fee cash - reportedly between $75,000 and $100,000 each - if they receive it as planned on Wednesday, Atsu said: 'I think we will keep it in our bags and we'll just lock them. And we will transfer the money to our accounts.' Ghana coach Kwesi Appiah said he had been having 'sleepless nights' over the issue which came to a head on Tuesday when the players and team management had a meeting instead of conducting a training session. President Mahama 'personally spoke to the players' to assure them they would receive the money, the Ghana Football Association said in a statement. VIDEO Ghana settle pay dispute ahead of Portugal clash . Blip: The bonus row has disrupted Ghana's preparations for the decisive Group G game against Portugal . 'Every player ... knows it is his right,' Appiah said. 'The management and the government are trying to sort it out and everything will be sorted out in two or three hours' time,' he added. 'They should have received it before the start of the competition but it's being solved now and we are really focused on the game now.' Players aren't being paid by electronic transfer because 'the practice in Ghana has always been paying the money in cash,' Appiah said. Appiah wouldn't give an exact figure for the appearance fees owed to the players, saying: 'I would be a bad person ... the players would kill me if I said.' Ghana's deputy sports minister Joseph Yammin said that around $3 million would be flown over, but it wasn't clear how Ghana would be able to bring the money into Brazil without paying tax on it. Brazilian officials said bringing in such an amount and not declaring it to authorities would be illegal and that the entire amount could be confiscated. Individuals cannot bring in more than $4,500 each without having it subject to taxes, said Brazil's Federal Police, who enforce custom and immigration laws. The nation's federal tax agency also said it knew of no exemptions for any individuals or entities, including Ghana's World Cup team. The agency didn't indicate in the emailed statement what sort of taxes could be levied on money over that limit. No chance: Christian Atsu (right) dismissed fears that his team would boycott the final match . Like other African countries playing at the World Cup, Ghana's government is financing the player bonuses. The money will later be reimbursed by some of the prize money - of at least $8 million - that FIFA guarantees each country, even if it is knocked out in the group stage. That won't be paid to Ghana until after the tournament, the GFA said. FIFA also gives each of the 32 teams competing $1.5 million beforehand to help with preparation costs. Before the tournament, Cameroon's squad refused to board a plane to Brazil until their demands for improved bonuses were met. There have also been rumblings of discontent over pay in the Nigeria and Ivory Coast camps. Ghana was Africa's only team to qualify for the second round at the last World Cup and reached the quarterfinals. On Thursday, Ghana must beat Portugal and hope Germany beats the United States heavily in the other group game to advance.

"An elderly man has died in a fire just one hour after emergency crews walked out on some of the busiest nights of the year in a dispute over pensions. Firefighters were called to a house in Wednesbury, West Midlands, yesterday night and when they arrived the found the man had already died from smoke inhalation. Area Commander Simon Shilton, of the West Midlands Fire Service, admitted that resources had been 'stretched' - with 17 engines attending 40 fires. A pensioner has died after a fire on this road in Wednesbury, West Midlands, just an hour after emergency crews walked out on strike on some of the busiest nights of the year . He also revealed that the pensioner - who has not been named - was killed by a slow-burning fire which started in his kitchen, and was already extinguished by the time emergency workers arrived. He added: 'It was a busy and challenging night. We attended more than 40 incidents and our limited resources were stretched at times. 'Sadly, we attended one incident in which an elderly man had died. It appears that he had been overcome by smoke from a slow-burning fire in his kitchen. 'The fire was out when we got there and had occurred several hours earlier. 'There was also a fire at a factory in Walsall. Crews were there for more than three hours. At this stage the cause has yet to be determined.' Firefighters left their stations at 6pm yesterday and will not return until 6pm on Tuesday, the evening before Bonfire Night, with brigades across England warning they may struggle to respond. The West Yorkshire brigade warned that the service and the public will be left in a 'vulnerable position', telling people to take extra care to ensure their own safety. The London brigade said it might not attend bin or small grass fires, or help anyone shut in a lift during the strike. Picket lines were mounted outside fire stations, as brigade chiefs launched contingency plans, including hiring contract staff. The Government has been accused of showing 'contempt' for public sector after insisting that firefighters will still receive one of the best pension schemes, even after the reforms. Fire Brigade Union members will be out on strike until Tuesday morning in a row over pensions, with the London service warning that they might not attend small blazes, or rescue people trapped in lifts (file pic) The FBU hit back at Government statements, saying: 'We have a Government of millionaires who are wrecking the pensions of firefighters and other public sector workers while the real scandal is that their own pensions are by far the most generous anywhere in the public sector. 'This is a case of those at the top getting more while everyone else is robbed blind. Firefighters are sickened by the Government's 'snouts in the trough' approach to this issue. 'How can it be remotely fair that the Prime Minister, already a millionaire, enjoys a far greater subsidy from his employer in absolute and proportional terms than a firefighter who is earning less than £30,000 a year? It is sickening hypocrisy.' TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'Once again the Government is showing its contempt for public service workers. 'Evidence warns that raising the normal retirement age for firefighters would lead to older fighters facing no job and no pension after years of good service. 'This same evidence has already led to concessions being made in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland - but the Westminster Government has chosen to walk away from the negotiating table. 'We are very concerned about the risks to firefighters, and those who rely on the fire service, when firefighters are forced to stay in frontline service until they reach the age of 60.' The Firefighters' Pension Scheme is the most expensive in the public sector and is forecast to have a cashflow deficit of almost £600 million by 2018/19, according to the Government. Fiona Twycross, Labour fire spokeswoman, said: 'It is deeply disappointing that we have got to this position, but it seems clear the Government is set on escalating this dispute.' Fire Minister Penny Mordaunt said: 'It is regrettable that the Fire Brigades Union has announced this strike action, which is unnecessary and the aim of which is unclear.'","Elderly man was found dead from smoke inhalation at 7.11pm yesterday .

"One of English football’s best-known referees has been censured by the FA for making a racist comment at an officials’ summit. David Elleray, former house-master at Harrow School and the highest-profile official at the start of the Premier League, racially abused Robert McCarthy, who is black and a referee coaching manager for the FA in non-league football, at a referees’ meeting at St George’s Park on June 21. Elleray was heard by a number of people to say to McCarthy: ‘You looked rather tanned’, adding: ‘have you been down a coal mine?’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch some incredible refereeing moments . Race row: David Elleray (left) was heard making the offensive remarks at a referees' meeting . Investigation: The FA said that no official complaint was made about the incident . The FA investigated the incident and on Thursday night said: ‘While no official complaint was made, the FA gave this matter its full consideration and it is our view that the comment did breach the . FA Council Code of Conduct.’ Elleray, 59, is chairman of the FA’s referee committee. He also sits on UEFA’s referees committee and acts as a technical adviser to FIFA. He was made an MBE for services to football in the Queen’s birthday honours last month. Alistair Maclean, the FA’s company secretary and group legal director, carried out the investigation when reports of Elleray’s inappropriate behaviour first reached Wembley. He has been formally reminded of the importance of the code, his duties as a council member and required to undertake equality and diversity training. Elleray has apologised unreservedly, but it is difficult to see how this slap on the wrist will end an incident Wembley ‘consider closed’. His positions at the FA, UEFA and FIFA look untenable, especially given the FA’s commitment to diversity at all levels of football. The FA will also be embarrassed that such an own goal from one of their senior figures follows their strong stance against Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore’s sexist email exchange. Elleray, who retired as housemaster of Druries in 2009, did not respond to calls on Thursday night. The All England Club, which has a long history of equal rights including  prize-money, is forging a surprisingly close relationship with the Augusta National golf club, whose membership could never be described as diverse. The mutual admiration society has even seen Wimbledon’s junior digital staff invited to Augusta, while the bespoke clothes hangers in the Wimbledon locker rooms are based on the Masters design. Institutions: The All England Club is forging a close relationship with the Augusta National golf club . BBC broadcaster John Inverdale’s comment at last year’s Wimbledon that champion Marion Bartoli was ‘never going to be a looker’ created such a storm that the then Culture Secretary Maria Miller wrote to the BBC director general demanding action. However the All England Cub have welcomed Inverdale back into the fold to the extent that both his daughters, Josie and Juliette, have been employed in the broadcast office during the tournament. Andy Murray will drop to No 10 in the rankings at the end of Wimbledon and any further slide is likely to have a significant impact on his earnings as most of the deals involving the leading players have financial penalties for being out of the top 10. Murray signed a £4.6million deal with Standard Life on the eve of the tournament and while their top brass were at Wimbledon to watch Murray begin his title defence, they missed Wednesday’s horror show against Grigor Dimitrov. Slipping: Andy Murray's earnings will suffer significantly after his disappointing Wimbledon performance . BBC Sport presenters and pundits plugging their sponsorships has become a sensitive issue this summer, with Jonathan Agnew (Waitrose) and Garry Richardson (Unibet) having to curtail their involvement. Yet All England Club committee man Tim Henman has been allowed to blatantly promote his backers HSBC on the Beeb with only a mild censure. Henman, wearing tennis kit for a breakfast television interview, was asked what he was doing and seized the opportunity to mention the bank. A BBC spokesman said: ‘The BBC makes every effort to not give undue prominence to any event sponsors. On this occasion Tim made a mistake and has been reminded of the BBC’s editorial guidelines.’ The Beeb added that Agnew and Richardson had, unlike Henman, been using their BBC role for commercial purposes.

"That social media was super-rich Brooks Newmark’s undoing should come as no surprise: Just two years ago he became the first MP to be sacked for his obsession with tweeting. He lost his job as a Tory Whip after posting a stream of showbusiness-themed messages – including whether he should watch Downton Abbey or Spooks. One said: ‘I went to see Bridesmaids last night – guys it may be a chick flick but it was hysterically funny!’ But within a few weeks of being restored to Government office in July as Charities Minister, the warning signs were there again as his maverick streak got the better of him. Scroll down for video . Brooks Newmark (pictured) with his wife Lucy in 2005 lost his job as a Tory Whip two years ago after posting a stream of showbusiness-themed messages – including whether he should watch Downton Abbey or Spooks . In his first speech as minister he was accused of insulting charitable organisations by telling them to keep their noses out of politics and ‘stick to knitting’. He said: ‘We really want to try and keep charities and voluntary groups out of the realms of politics. When they stray into the realm of politics that is not what they are about and that is not why people give them money. ‘The important thing charities should be doing is sticking to their knitting – they should be about helping others.’ He later said he was referring to party politics. Born in Westport, Connecticut, but brought up from the age of nine in the UK, Newmark, 56, cuts an exotic figure at Westminster with his mid-Atlantic accent and fondness for travelling to dangerous places. He made a fortune in banking and is a personal friend of US Secretary of State John Kerry. The two have frequently discussed the Middle East. Mr Newmark has stepped down as Minister for Civil Society following allegations concerning his private life . It is a blow for David Cameron who was hoping to use his party conference as a launchpad to win the Election . He has been a strong supporter of tough military action in Syria and met Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad several times up until 2011, when the current crisis there began. Last year, he travelled to meet Syrian rebel leaders before condemning Labour for blocking military action by the UK against al-Assad for using chemical weapons. Educated at Harvard and Oxford, Newmark was vice-president of the international division of Shearson Lehman Brothers and worked for an private equity firm. He entered the Commons in 2005 as MP for Braintree. He lives in a £15 million home in Belgravia, London, with his wife Lucy – daughter of distinguished historian Sir John Keegan. The couple have five children.","Brooks Newmark, MP for Braintree, steps down as Minister for Civil Society .

"Twenty years after she drowned her young sons and incited racial tensions in her little South Carolina town by blaming a fictional black carjacker, Susan Smith's world is as fractured as ever. A source on the inside reveals that, besides being caught having sex with prison guards on two occasions, Smith has taken a lesbian jailhouse lover and sports horrific wrist scars following at least on gory suicide attempt. Just as nothing can bring back 14-month-old Alex and Michael Smith, 3, one officials says the justice system has yet to bring the now 43-year-old former mother back from the depraved place she was in when she left her little boys trapped in a sinking car. Scroll down for video... 20 years on: Susan Smith has spent the last two decades paying for the day in 1994 when she strapped her 14-month- and 3-year-old sons Alex and Michael into their car seats and rolled the car into a South Carolina lake . Murdered: Smith initially blamed a 'black man' she claimed carjacked her and then sped off with the boys, who were found strapped into her car at the bottom of a lake . Still troubled: Since her 1995 conviction, Smith has received multiple citations for misbehavior inside prison . 'Most murderers are one-time, crime-of-passion people, and they end up becoming good people,' former director of the South Carolina Department of Corrections Jon Ozmint told The State. 'Susan Smith just hasn't been able to fit that mold.' Just as was so widely reported following the 1994 arrest that rocked the little town of Union, Ozmint described Smith as the vain, manipulative. 'She is truly a narcissist, and she thrives on the media's attention. Someone like that, I didn't want to feed that narcissism. Other than passing her on the yard, I wouldn't give her any extra, undue attention,' Ozmint said. On two occasions in 2000, Ozmint said guards at Smith's initial prison--Women's Correctional Center in Columbia--had sex with Smith despite warnings she should not be left alone with male correctional officers. 'We were back there and arrested a captain and a lieutenant for having improper relations with her,' Ozmint told The State. Both men lost their jobs, but according to a fellow convict, Smith has found ways to continue her jailhouse delinquency despite being transferred to Leath Correctional Institution in Greenwood. Stephanie Hulsey. 34, told the National Enquirer back in 2012 that Smith nearly killed herself at age 40 when she slashed her wrists with a smuggled-in razor. Sordid life: Smith was twice caught having sexual relations with male prison guards in 2000. She's since taken on a lesbian jailhouse lover, according to a fellow inmate . Locked up: Smith was convicted in 1995 and sentenced to life in prison for killing 14-month-old Alex and 3-year-old Michael. She is up for parole in 2024, when she'll be 53 . 'There was blood behind spurting everywhere and she was weeping, but she wasn't crying out in pain,' Hulsey said. 'She used to say, 'You don't feel pain when you cut. Cutting takes all the pain away.' Hulsey also recalled a jailhouse girlfriend who Smith kept in addition to male paramours with whom she kept in touch via letters. 'Her lover is a big woman who looks like a man,' said Hulsey, who added that one male pen pal has sent Smith thousands of dollars. Smith, who was sentenced to life in prison, faces her first parole possibility in 2024. She will be 53 years old. Smith's boys, 3-year-old Michael and 14-month-old Alex, disappeared Oct. 25, 1994. She told deputies they had been taken by an unidentified black man during a carjacking and she wept on national television as she begged for their safe return. Nine days later, Smith confessed, and the boys' bodies were found in the car, submerged a few feet from a boat ramp at John D. Long Lake in Union County. Sad: A memorial to the young sons Smith murdered in 1994 sits beside the lake in which the boys were purposely drowned . Smith was convicted in July 1995. Prosecutor Tommy Pope had sought the death penalty, and he considers the case a loss. Smith's lawyers vigorously fought to save her life. They brought in testimony she had sex with her stepfather and several other men to argue she was depressed and intended to stay in the car and commit suicide with her sons, but decided to jump out after releasing the emergency brake. The case incensed the black community because Smith claimed a black man carjacked her and drove off with the children. TIMELINE . October 17, 1994: By most accounts, the Susan Smith saga truly began when a man named Tom Findley, with whom Smith was having an affair, broke things off. He said in a letter that he did not want children. October 25, 1994: Susan Smith drowned Alex and Michael in her car, which she eased off a lake boat access ramp . October 25, 1994: Smith tells police she was carjacked by a black man, who drove off with the boys . November 2, 1994: Smith and her husband David famously appear on national TV. Smith tearfully begs for the boys return . November 3, 1994: Smith confesses to drowning Alex and Michael. That same day, divers recover the boys' bodies beneath 18 feet of water . July 22, 1995: A jury finds Smith guilty on two counts of murder . July 28, 1995: Smith is sentenced to life in prison . September 11, 2000: Smith is found guilty of sexual misconduct after being caught engaging in sex acts with two correctional officers, who were both fired. Smith received revocation of 45 days of recreational privileges and 75 days of canteen privileges . Smith was also disciplined in April 2009, April 2010 and in June 2012. Sources: The State and S.C.

"The secret 'first son' of Lucian Freud has said he felt he was being airbrushed out of family history after the artist died. With the artist’s £96 million fortune still to be settled, Paul McAdam Freud, who is one of four children from Freud’s relationship with the artist Katherine McAdam, said he was asked to prove he is Freud’s son. 'They tried to airbrush me from his history. It was deeply offensive and hurtful,' said the 55-year-old. Paul McAdam Freud, left, one of four children from Lucian Freud’s, right, relationship with Katherine McAdam, felt he was being airbrushed out of family history after the artist's death in 2011 . Freud’s death in July 2011 started a battle for recognition and to prove he is a genuine relation as his father’s will was being processed. Of one of his last meetings with his father, McAdam Freud told The Sunday Times: 'I did ask him at that meeting about the fact that it had been reported he had 14 acknowledged children. 'I said, ""I am acknowledged, aren’t I?"" He said: ""I would never, ever not acknowledge you"".' Freud met McAdam when she was studying fashion at St Martin’s School of Art in London and later moved to Roehampton, south-west London, in the late 1960s, when the pair parted. McAdam Freud re-established contact with his father - who he physically resembled - in 1989 . 'When I was 25 I used to look at the self-portraits he painted. It was like looking in the mirror,' he said. The solicitors handling Freud’s affairs told the Times that the executors of the will had always acted in the best interests of the beneficiaries of his estate. McAdam Freud bears a striking physically resemblance to his father, pictured left in 1958, and  he says that looking at Freud's self-portraits, right, was like 'looking in the mirror' In July, McAdam Freud lost his bid to secure a share of the artist's fortune following a dispute in the High Court. McAdam Freud, brother of fashion designer Bella Freud, was fighting a clause in his father's will which meant he would inherit none of the money. He was also fighting a clause that meant only two people will ever know exactly who the artist's estate is handed to. At the time of Freud's death three years ago, Diana Rawstrom, his trusted solicitor, and Rose Pearce, one of his daughters, were the sole beneficiaries. After legacies and taxes the pair inherited an estimated £42million. But they have since revealed that Freud secretly instructed them to pass on money to a list of others, without ever revealing their identities or the sums of money involved. McAdam Freud tried to lift the lid on this secrecy by arguing that part of the will was illegitimate, but he failed in his attempt. Freud made his fortune through his portrait work, thought by many to be the best of his generation. His most famous work, 'Benefits Supervisor Sleeping' (pictured), sold for a world-record $33.8million in 2008 . If he had succeeded it would also have meant Freud would have died largely intestate, and his millions would have been handed out to his next of kin, a complicated task given that the exact number of his children is unknown - though the court heard that it was 'at least 14'. Lucian's only legitimate offspring, two daughters named Annie and Annabel, came from his marriage to Kitty Garman - a muse of his whom he married in 1948. However, he had another four children by  Suzy Boyt, a student he had met at the Slade school of art in the fifties, and another four, including McAdam Freud and sisters Jane, Bella and Esther, by Kathleen McAdam. After Kathleen left him in 1966, it is said that he barely saw any of the family for 20 years. The Greek sculptor Vassilakis Takis, a close friend of Lucian's, estimated that he had at least 500 lovers during his lifetime, while family friends insist that his children could number as high as 30. Revealing the true beneficiaries of Freud's will could have lifted the lid on some of the mystery, but following the ruling in July, only Mrs Rawstrom and Mrs Pearce will know who receives the money. Freud's portraits often featured nudes of  his friends and family. This portrait is of his daughter, Bella . Speaking at the High Court, the judge said he could ‘readily understand’ McAdam Freud’s concerns about the secrecy of the will, from which he stood to gain nothing. ‘There is a lot of money involved here, so I fully understand these are important issues,’ he said, before ruling that Mrs Rawstrom’s and Mrs Pearce’s interpretation of the will made ‘common sense’. Although, on the face of it, the will appeared to give the £42 million to Mrs Rawstrom and Mrs Pearce ‘absolutely’, they had since made clear that they held the money only as trustees and were bound to distribute the cash under a cloak of confidentiality. ‘They wish to respect the deceased’s wishes not to disclose the terms of the fully secret trust to anyone who is not a beneficiary,’ their barrister, Michael Furness QC, had earlier told the court. The judge said it had ‘at one time been disputed’ that McAdam Freud was the artist’s son, but it had been accepted - at least for the purposes of the court hearing - that he was ‘another of Lucian Freud’s children’. By his will, the artist specifically left a £2.5m tax-free gift and a house in west London to his assistant of more than 20 years, David Dawson. A second clause instructed Mrs Pearce and Mrs Rawstron to dispose of ‘chattels’ on the basis of instructions given during his life. One of Freud’s works was also given to the National Gallery in lieu of inheritance tax.","Paul McAdam Freud was one of four children from Lucian Freud's relationship with fellow artist Katherine McAdam .

"A California man's romantic proposal to his girlfriend almost ended in complete disaster when their sunset hot air balloon ride crash landed into the Pacific Ocean on Sunday. Hundreds of beach goers at Cardiff-by-the-Sea watched the balloon veer dramatically off course around 7pm, just after Eric Barretto had successfully proposed to girlfriend, Jennilyn Buenaventura Garcia. The pilot could not return the stricken balloon to shore, so dozens of surfers swam out to meet the balloon as it hovered over the surface and watched as Barretoo and Garcia jumped from the basket into the water. Scroll down for videos . Escape: One of the three passengers dives into the sea off the coast of Cardiff-by-the-Sea on Sunday evening during the disastrous hot air balloon proposal of Eric Barretto .

Relieved he managed to propose before his dramatic rescue, Barretto said that at least he and his fiancé will have a story to tell at their wedding. 'It's unforgettable. That's all I can say,' said Barretto. 'I don't know if we'll do it again.' Matt Lawson, who witnessed the beach crash said that he initially did not know that the pilot and passengers were in trouble. 'We all just thought that, you know, they were just having some fun, just getting their passengers close to the water,' said Lawson to ABC News. Witnesses: Hundreds watched from the shore as the balloon ditched and bobbed in the sea - its torch trying and failing to lift the basket . Unusual: The balloon veered dramatically off course at around 7pm on Sunday and attracted an audience of hundreds . 'Someone dropped a rope out of the balloon, and all of the surfers started piling over.' Cellphone footage from the accident shows Barretto and his fiancé jumping out of the basket into the sea. The balloon pilot was identified as Tim, who works for Panda Air Bear Balloon Flights. He told NBC San Diego that strong winds caused the balloon to be pushed off course westwards, leaving him no choice but to attempt to either use onshore winds to push them back or to ditch in the water.

"Two months after popping the champagne when Sunderland miraculously avoided relegation from the Premier League, striker Connor Wickham has been spotted partying hard with a £17,500 bottle of the stuff.

"The name Joel Campbell isn’t one that was taken altogether seriously until February 25. This was a youngster who had been signed speculatively by Arsene Wenger three years previously and one - via a trio of loan spells largely down to work permit issues - who wouldn’t be knocking on the first team door for a good while. That was until he picked up a ball 30 yards from goal against Manchester United during that night in the Champions League last-16. VIDEO Scroll down for Paulo Wanchope: Joel Campbell wants to impress winger . Rise and rise of: Joel Campbell has launched himself into the public eye in the past few months . Power: The Costa Rican forward has played a vital role in their qualification from Group D . Those along the corridors at London Colney stood up and took rather more notice when the Olympiacos man strode on to a loose ball, made Michael Carrick look less-than-handy by sidestepping him with ease and bent a wicket effort beyond the despairing David de Gea. Eyebrows raised, eyes slightly widened; is this the man - farmed out to Greece after tricky spells with Real Betis and Lorient - Arsenal have been missing? The answer already appears to be yes, given Wenger’s admittance that Campbell would be on his way back to the club for pre-season after three campaigns away. ‘He will definitely come back to us,’ Wenger told Sportsmail after Costa Rica’s drubbing of Uruguay. ‘He is maturing well.’ Campbell has been the Central Americans’ star of this tournament thus far, scoring in that 3-1 win against Edinson Cavani and co while putting in a more disciplined and resolute shift against the Italians on Friday night. And he now has the opportunity to hammer a final nail into England’s coffin when the sides meet in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday. Italian job: Campbell celebrating following their incredible victory . Sandwiched: The 21-year-old being crowded out by Matteo Darmian (left) and Giorgio Chiellini . Finisher: Campbell celebrating his goal for Olympiacos against Man Utd in February . VIDEO Team Profile: Costa Rica . Roy Hodgson’s men are already booked on the first flight out of South America when the whistle is blown on a wretched campaign that began with enthusiastic hope rather than searing expectation. The goodwill shown towards the manager - who rightly, on the whole at least, chose to blood the youngsters in the first two defeats - will be somewhat tempered if they suffer the ignominy of losing all three group games. With Campbell pulling the strings for Costa Rica, that is a very real possibility. While his goal against Uruguay was well-taken - particularly his decision to hang back on the edge of the box to wait for the second ball - there were two other moments that will have Hodgson twitchy. The first saw the 21-year-old, as against United in February, pick up a ball way out, drive at the Uruguayans and send a stinging effort just wide; the second he pulled to the right, checked inside before crafting a beautifully-weighted ball alongside the centre-half for Marco Urena to poke home. Enchanting in its simplicity. It is from those pockets - Robbie Savage would tell you they are ‘between the lines’ - where the Three Lions could suffer. The manager is likely to play Frank Lampard in the middle of midfield, and he could be paired with Jack Wilshere - their primary job to stop Campbell roaming deep and dictating proceedings. A lack of pace and protection in that area has been England’s undoing, although it’s debatable whether that obvious problem will be fixed in time for Tuesday given the personnel thought to be in the XI. And then there is Campbell’s naivety of youth which is likely to trouble the full-backs. He sees no issue in neglecting his central station to go and have a roam wide. It’s refreshing to watch. Shock: Costa Rica players celebrating during their over Uruguay . Baby bump: Joel Campbell celebrating his goal against the South American side . For all of the new-age England we’ve witnessed over the past ten days, those Savage lines and covert rotation, there hasn’t been one man to drop off and purposefully pick holes. Couple Campbell’s innocence with some blistering pace and confidence in possession - see his penalty appeal against the Italians for reference - Arsenal have a real player on their hands. The only potential difficulty will be his ability, or otherwise, to heed strict instructions, although in the first two games he seems adept at tracking back and helping the midfield five. ‘I believe I’m ready to play for Arsenal next season. I have the capacity to play there and I am only waiting for the opportunity,’ he said this week. No kidding, and England could find out to their cost.

"It was far from the nicest Saturday, weather-wise, in Manhattan today. But Ivanka Trump was not going to let a grey sky stop her from a family outing in Central Park. Effortlessly classy in a smock, the 32-year-old daughter of Donald Trump and her husband, real estate developer Jared Kushner, spent the afternoon strolling around the urban paradise with their two children.

That came, incredibly, despite the youngster only breaking into the team in January. Charlton had been in discussions with Poyet's representatives over an extension to his deal, which expired on July 1, but he made his feelings clear by telling the club he would not report to pre-season training.

"Luis Suarez has left Liverpool for Barcelona in a £75million deal and the rest of the country will bid 'Good Riddance'. Branded a biting, racist cheat, the shamed striker's admittance of guilt over biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini was the final insult for a proud club that lent him so much support. Liverpool have taken the decision to sell as they could no longer countenance the tarnishing of their image. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Suarez appeal rejeceted . Thumbs up: Luis Suarez has signed for Barcelona in a £75m move from Liverpool . Good riddance: The Anfield club should be glad to get rid of a player who was tarnishing their image . Fined: Suarez was accused of racially abusing Patrice Evra in a game against Manchester United . His four year stay left a trail of havoc; diving, obscene gestures, racially abusing Patrice Evra and biting the arm of Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic. Defending Suarez had arguably already cost previous manager Kenny Dalglish his job and Brendan Rodgers spoke sympathetically of how Suarez was a reformed character who had learned from his mistakes. Declared English football's player of the year, Suarez professed his love for Liverpool, shed public tears when they let the Premier League title slip through their grasp and still spoke of his desire to stay. Barely 50 days later, many of the club's fans are questioning whether his fiendish actions in Brazil have all been part of a calculated, manipulative plan to escape to Spain. His bite on PSV Eindhoven's Otman Bakkal in 2010 preceded a move from Ajax, his bite on Ivanovic precipitated Arsenal's interest and now Chiellini has seemingly served his purpose. Suarez's apology, for sinking his teeth into the Italian's shoulder and gaining a four month suspension, has been praised by Fifa president Sepp Blatter and a Barcelona hierarchy desperate to be vindicated in their choice of signing. First bite: Suarez was caught biting PSV's Ottman Bakkal while he was playing for Ajax . Waving goodbye: Suarez did so much to rectify his reputation in England, but it is now back in the gutter . Mesmeric footballer though he is, the boy who rose from the Salto street gutter of Uruguay has returned to the gutter in many people's eyes. England captain Steven Gerrard hailed Suarez as the best player he has ever played with. For all his wonderful skill and spectacular goals though, his behaviour means he cannot be compared to the pantheon of great foreign talent to have graced the Premier League. Do not forget his talk of retribution following his dismantling of England's World Cup hopes in Uruguay's 2-1 win; criticising how this country has treated him. 'Before the game, too many people in England laughed about my attitude over the last few years,' he said. 'This is a very good time for me. I want to see what they think now.' Not much Luis and even less once you took a liking to Chiellini's tenderised shoulder. Feted as an idol, this man's actions have been borderline grotesque and now his wishes have been granted with a move to Barcelona. Adios. You're welcome to him. VIDEO Suarez appeal rejected .

"Letting your husband teach you how to drive might sound like a recipe for marital disaster but that hasn't stopped three intrepid women from doing exactly that. Yet despite the potential for pit falls, Rebecca Hornsby, 33, from Hertfordshire, says far from being a disaster, having partner Greg, 31, with her in the car proved something of a blessing. 'When I was younger, I was in a road traffic accident and my boyfriend at the time was killed,' explains the mother-of-three. 'It made me terrified of being on the road.' Scroll down for video . Oh dear: A terrified Greg rests his head against the car after spending an hour in the car with Rebecca . A controlling relationship followed, leaving Ms Hornsby lacking in confidence and unwilling to face up to her fears. All that changed, however, when she met Greg Johnson, a teacher and now the father of their three children, Alfie, nine, Sienna, four, and Bluebell, one. 'Being with Greg has cleared the way for me to do things for myself,' adds his adoring partner, 'and he and the children gave me the confidence to start driving again.' Not, however, that driving lessons with Greg went entirely to plan. Filmed for Channel 5 documentary, Never Teach Your Wife To Drive, Ms Hornsby's inability to concentrate on the road is enough to leave Greg tearing his hair out. A lack of spatial awareness and a fondness for the accelerator don't help either, with Greg at one point leaning over to grab the wheel, only for Ms Hornsby to screech: 'You're not allowed to grab my flipping wheel! That must be illegal, Greg!' Terror: Rebecca and Greg scream in terror as she plunges across a junction towards a petrol station . Stop! A clearly rattled Greg can't resist grabbing the wheel - much to his other half's displeasure . But while it might sound, quite literally, like a recipe for car crash TV, Ms Hornsby insists that the overall experience has been a positive one, even if she wasn't too keen on her other half's 'blunt and to-the-point' teaching style. 'We have a very strong relationship, we laugh everyday and always make up if we have a tiff,' she explains. 'If your relationship is strong it shouldn't cause a problem and I enjoyed every minute. We still laugh about the experience now.' Poor Greg is also nursing some bruises after Ms Hornsby accidentally hit him with the car and, unsurprisingly, asked her to get a real driving instructor for attempt number two. One lesson she is still to learn is one that Greg spends much of the series trying to pass on - concentrate on the road. 'Greg teaching me to drive only really affected our relationship while we were in the car,' she explains. Happy ending: Despite the thrills and spills, Rebecca said she would do it all over again given the chance . 'Greg was always telling me to take it seriously and concentrate but that was something I found really difficult because I'm a fun-loving person and rarely take anything seriously.' And, in one heart-stopping moment, it almost had fatal results. 'I put my foot on the wrong pedal and shot across the junction into a petrol station,' she admits. Another scary moment saw her take out a row of recycling bins - much to the horror of both Greg and the driving examiner in the back. But, hopes Ms Hornsby, the day when she finally makes it onto the road as a fully-fledged driver isn't far off and since the end of filming, has passed her theory test. Still having lessons, albeit not with Greg, she says her driving has improved immeasurably although, she jokes, she still rings her friends and family to warn them when she's on the road. After a litany of near misses, tension-laden drives and driving induced flare-ups, would she recommend other women employ their husbands as driving instructors? 'I'd definitely do it all again,' she chuckles. 'From me, it's a big, fat yes!'","Rebecca Hornsby, 33, from Hertfordshire, has never learned to drive .

"Ellen DeGeneres has announced the launch of her own lifestyle brand, to include a home-and-garden range, men's and women's clothing, and even pet accessories. The 56-year-old talk show host has called the company E.D. - her initials, and the nickname given to her by wife Portia de Rossi - and will launch with a gift-orientated capsule collection this November, just in time for the holidays. 'I wouldn’t be doing this if I didn’t want it to be the biggest brand name that you can imagine,' she told WWD of her lofty plans. Entrepreneur: Talk show host Ellen DeGeneres (left) is launching her own lifestyle brand, E.D. (right) - after the pet-name her wife Portia de Rossi has for her - which will debut in early November . 'My goal is that people can have a beautiful house, a really comfortable house, without only being able to afford [very expensive] things,' she explains. '[The] price point will be mid-level. As far as who it's for, I think it's for anyone.' Ellen's first collection of goods will include gift-friendly tableware, candles, home decor, pajamas and gift wrap, and will be available online and in-store at several unnamed retailers around the U.S. The full launch will happen next spring, and carry a wider range of home and garden wares, as well as men's and women's fashion, and a pet collection. Ellen's venture is bolstered by retail mogul Christopher Burch – ex-husband of Tory Burch, and the man responsible for helping launch her fashion empire. He describes her as the dream business partner, saying: 'Everyone responds to her - you're a man, you're a woman, you're a mom, you're a working mom - she brings a happiness and a light and a true authenticity.' Animal lovers: Ellen (pictured last month with wife Portia) is a vocal advocate of the couple's health-conscious, vegan lifestyle, and E.D. will release its range of cat and dog accessories next Spring . Ellen has thrown her weight behind several brands in the past, from American Express to Covergirl and JCPenney, and the self-confessed 'big animal lover' has a particular loyalty to the support of animal-rights organizations, such as PETA. In 2011, she launched Going Vegan With Ellen, a site dedicated to her animal-friendly diet and lifestyle. She had an all-vegan wedding with Portia in 2008, and more recently, had plans to open a vegan tapas bar in Los Angeles, which ultimately fell through. 'My goal is that people can have a . beautiful house, a really comfortable house, without only being able to . afford [very expensive] things' House-flipping is another of her passions. According to TMZ, Ellen recently made a whopping $15 million profit on the L.A. mansion she purchased for $40 million just six months ago, after selling it to Napster co-founder Sean Parker for $55 million. Mr Parker reportedly 'went nuts over the famous house and Ellen's interior design,' so if this glowing report is anything to go by, E.D.'s imminent launch could well be a storming success.","The brand's first set of gift-friendly products will be 'mid-level' in price, and will launch in early November .

"Philipp Lahm will not be moved back to his previous position of full-back, despite clamour in Germany for changes to be made to the national team for Friday's World Cup quarter-final clash with France. Lahm was transformed into a midfielder by Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola last season and it is there where he has played most recently for Germany. Following the enforced substitution of Shkodran Mustafi during Germany's extra-time win over Algeria in the last 16, Lahm was moved back to the right-back position he had made his own for club and country over many years, earning recognition as one of the best in the world in that position.

Free running: Lahm was transformed into a midfielder by Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola last season . VIDEO All Star XI: Phillip Lahm . His passing and tackling statistics improved considerably following the transition on Monday, which saw Sami Khedira partner Bastian Schweinsteiger in the Germany midfield. However, not even that is going to convince Germany boss Joachim Low to alter Lahm's position in Rio de Janeiro. 'I have made up my mind already on Philipp Lahm's role,' Low told Germany's Die Zeit newspaper. 'And I am sticking by it to the very end. 'Philipp Lahm has been a leading figure for us in recent years and he's been playing at the highest level for a decade, but he will only move back into defence if we have a problem on the right, at which point I might say ""okay, now it's up to Philipp who can push forwards down the right."" 'But that would only be an emergency scenario, and we need to prevent there being an emergency.' His defiance will hardly comfort many Germany fans, who were left somewhat bemused by Low's choices during a tighter-than-expected game against Algeria. Plenty to ponder: Head coach Joachim Low says he has no plans to revert Lahm back to his previous station . All smiles: Jerome Boateng (left), Mesut Ozil, Lukas Podolski and Sami Khedira show off their thunder thighs . Mesut Ozil found himself in the firing line too, but Low has leapt to the Arsenal midfielder's defence. 'Mesut is extremely important to us,' he said. 'The criticism of him is just as incomprehensible as that for Lahm. 'Sometimes things get published a little too hastily and I don't feel the right weight is given to certain things.' Nevertheless, Low acknowledged that his side's performance against Algeria was not necessarily a vintage one. 'You can't always play fantastic football at a World Cup,' he said. 'You've just got to leave the field triumphant, and that's what we did. 'We have worked hard, both during the preparation in South Tyrol and here in Brazil, and realised what we must improve. 'It's only normal that you keep on learning throughout a tournament, and this also helps you recognise your team's finesse.'

"The man with the fastest draw in SW19 was not hanging around. Milos Raonic, a Canadian with a serve that doubles the speed limit on British motorways, is through to the third round after discarding Jack Sock in straight sets.

Flying start: Canada's Milos Raonic roars after breaking the serve of Jack Sock during their second-round game . Outclassed: Jack Sock of the USA wasn't able to deal with the power of Milos Raonic .

Indeed, between Sock and Matthew Ebden, Raonic’s first-round victim, only one break point has been offered and it was not taken. With his net play and strong forehand, the 23-year-old can be a significant figure here, with the expectation being that he will soon mount a challenge on the top players in the men's game. ‘A lot more work needs to be done,’ he said. ‘I want to do much better than I have in the past.

The lame attempts to stop . the little maestro in the build-up to Gonzalo Higuain’s eight-minute . goal were as lethargic as The Stretford End would recall from last . season. In fact, his brightest moment came when he didn’t need to use . his feet – stretching his 6ft4ins frame after an hour to head Jan . Vertonghen’s cross over the bar.

"West Brom have signed Belgian international Sebastien Pocognoli from Hannover 96 for an undisclosed fee. The 26-year-old moves to the Hawthorns on a three-year-deal, with an extra year's option, from the German outfit after agreeing personal terms and passing a medical. The defender becomes newly-appointed Baggies boss Alan Irvine's fourth signing at the club following the arrivals of Craig Gardner, Joleon Lescott and Chris Baird - all on free transfers. All smiles: West Brom have signed Belgian international Sebastien Pocognoli from Hannover 96 . New recruit: Pocognoli joins the Baggies on a three-year-deal for an undisclosed fee . Pocognoli, who plays as a left-back, has won 12 caps for Belgium and narrowly missed out on Marc Wilmots' World Cup squad after injury saw him miss the final six weeks of the Bundesliga season. The former Genk, AZ Alkmaar and Standard Liege full-back will join up with his new team-mates for pre-season training on Monday, with Irvine delighted at his latest capture. 'Sebastien is an experienced left-back who has played at a high level for many years,' he told the club's official website. 'After being named in Belgium’s provisional World Cup squad, he just missed out on Brazil, mainly because he hadn’t played enough games towards the end of the season. 'But he’s joined us with a real hunger to prove himself at Albion and get back into the international set-up. 'We’ve done our due diligence on Sebastien in terms of people who have worked with him, including Romelu Lukaku and Kevin Mirallas. 'You make your own mind up about a player’s ability from watching him play but you put these calls in to find out about their personality. The feedback on Sebastien was very positive.'

"Angel Di Maria has been ruled out of Argentina’s semi-final against Holland but fellow forward Sergio Aguero has recovered from a muscle strain and is fit to play, the team doctor said on Sunday. Aguero looked comfortable in training at the Argentine camp, but Di Maria was missing and undergoing intensive treatment after hobbling out of their 1-0 quarter-final win over Belgium. In their first semi-final since 1990, the South Americans play Holland in Sao Paulo on Wednesday. VIDEO Scroll down to hear Mascherano claim Holland are faster and stronger than Argentina . Doubt: Angel Di Maria's World Cup looks to be over after he suffered a thigh injury against Belgium . Replaced: Di Maria was substituted with a thigh injury in Argentina's win over Belgium . 'Angel has a grade one injury. Of course he won’t play in Argentina’s next game. After that, we’ll evaluate the situation day-by-day,' team doctor Daniel Martinez told reporters. 'Sergio has practiced three times. He’s ready to play.' Aguero missed two games due to a muscle strain but on the evidence of Sunday’s afternoon training session at their camp in Belo Horizonte, the speedy forward should at least make the substitutes bench. Agony: Di Maria looks likely to miss Argentina's first World Cup semi-final since 1990 . Surprise boost: Argentina's team doctor revealed that Aguero had recovered and could play against Holland . The absence of Di Maria, the South Americans’ most creative player after captain Lionel Messi, will be a big blow but the return to form of Gonzalo Higuain lessens the impact. Higuain’s instinctive strike against Belgium gave Argentina passage to the semi-finals.

Under attack: Enzo Perez tries to escape from Gonzalo Higuain as Argentina's squad train in high spirits . Quiet moment: Maxi Rodriguez kisses Lavezzi affectionately on the neck while the rest of the squad laugh . Mascherano said Argentina’s improved performance against Belgium was due to a more intelligent approach, which they had to repeat against the skilful Dutch. 'Against Belgium, we used the spaces better. We didn’t rush. We waited for the right moment to pass,' he said. 'It was a lovely game but it was yesterday. Now we’re focused on Holland. We know they are still smarting from defeat (in the final) in South Africa four years ago. 'We’ve come far - Argentines have waited 24 years for this, but we want to go further.'

"Brazil face Germany in their World Cup semi-final showdown on Tuesday evening. And to breed some fighting spirit ahead of their mouth-watering clash against the European giants, the host team, led by David Luiz and Julio Cesar, watched the UFC action from Las Vegas on Saturday night. The Brazil boys were backing former light heavyweight champion and fellow countryman Lyoto Machida, a winner of four of his last five bouts, who took on the unbeaten American Chris Weidman. VIDEO Scroll down to watch a Brazil player punch projector screen during the UFC bout . Eyes on the fight: The Brazilian World Cup squad watched Lyoto Machida face off against Chris Weidman . The Brazilians, who overcame Colombia 2-1 in their last-eight tie, paced up and down the room as they watched the middleweight title bout on a giant projection screen. At one point during the fight, with Machida having his opponent up against the cage, Cesar, unable to control his emotions, ran up to the screen before throwing air punches in apparent hope of spurring his compatriot on. Despite a brave resistance however, Machida lost the fight on a unanimous decision and after five gruelling rounds. Thiago Silva appeared to be filming his team-mates and posted the video to his Instagram account shortly afterwards. The Brazil captain tagged the video with a message which read: 'Mano you are already champion here, too; family of the Brazilian team'. Battle: Lyoto Machida (left) lost out to unbeaten American Chris Weidman in their title bout . The gloves are off: Goalkeeper Julio Cesar runs up to the screen and throws some punches during the fight . The Brazilian squad will train on Monday ahead of Tuesday's tie, and Silva remains some hope of playing in the last-four clash despite being ruled out of the match. FIFA confirmed that Brazil have lodged an appeal against his yellow card – his second of the tournament – which he picked up in the win over Colombia. Thiago received the caution after he blocked goalkeeper David Ospina taking a kick. The Brazilian federation has lodged an appeal and FIFA head of media Delia Fischer said: 'I can confirm we have received an appeal from the CBF and this is being analysed.' Yellow peril: Thiago Silva will miss Tuesday's clash against Germany after receiving a second booking of the tournament . VIDEO: Willian to shine in Neymar's absence - Silva . Their chances of success appear limited - appeals against yellow cards are not usually permitted, only red cards. Real Madrid appealed against Xabi Alonso being suspended for the Champions League final after he picked up a third booking in the semi-final, but UEFA ruled that appeal was inadmissible. Should FIFA overturn the yellow card it would be hugely controversial and would allow other teams to claim that the governing body is favouring the hosts.

"Algeria added their name to the list of beguiling stories at this World Cup by defeating South Korea in a meandering match and moving to the brink of the knock-out rounds for the first time in their history. Islam Slimani, Rafik Halliche, and Abdelmoumene Djabou each struck in 12 first-half minutes to sweep away their stereotype as a team set out to stifle.

Coach: Vahid Halilhodzi 8 . Goals: Slimani '26, Halliche '28, Djabou '38, Brahimi '62 . Man of the Match: Brahimi . The 61-year-old Bosnian has done much to alter the dour style of Algeria’s play since the 2010 World Cup, which saw them fail to score including an awful 0-0 draw with England. Algeria had mustered just two goals in 11 hours and 25 minutes of World Cup football before kick-off but in qualifying for Brazil were only outscored in their continent by Ghana, Ivory Coast and Egypt. They blitzed their opponents in chilly Porte Alegre with attacks of pace and fluidity. They also disturbed Korea with long balls and occasional physicality. The Asians’ defending was pretty abysmal too. Slimani got the first in the 26th minute, powering in between centre-backs Hong Jeong-ho and Kim Young-gwon to collect a long ball forward by Carkl Medjani and apply a finish beyond Jung Sung-ryong. Just one minute and 55 seconds later it was 2-0. Djabou swung over a corner that Jung thought he could claim but former Fulham defender Halliche arrived first to drive a header into the unguarded net. The Korean goalkeeper was poor in the game against Russia and could be replaced when Belgium come calling. More comical defending arrived soon after when Hong and Kim got in each others’ way as they attempted to clear a long ball, only succeeding in allowing it to fall to Slimani, who squared to Djabou to sweep in. Korea manager Hong Myung-bo, veteran of the 2002 team which made the semi-finals, must have said something to rouse his players at the break because they were much improved in the second half. Hug: Brahimi (centre) celebrates with his team-mates during the win over South Korea in Porto Alegre . Jump for joy: Halliche leaps and punches the air after putting Algeria 2-0 up against South Korea . Ecstasy: Brahimi (right) runs to the corner and is followed by team-mates after scoring the fourth . High five: South Korea midfielder Son (left) celebrates with Koo (right) after scoring his side's first goal . Madjid Bougherra’s inability to deal with a high ball allowed Son to whip a finish in between the legs of Rais M’Bolhi five minutes after the interval and Korea looked like they might make a comeback when a quick free-kick by Park Chu-young had to be headed off the line by Aissa Mandi. M’Bohli then produced a marvellous one-handed save to deny Swansea’s Kim Sung-yueng a ferocious, swerving goal from 30 yards that was heading for the top corner. But Brahami dispelled Algerian fears three minutes after the hour by finishing off a neat move that involved a slick exchange of passes with Djabou. Koo Ja-Cheoi tapped in from Lee Keun-ho’s cross with 18 minutes left to reduce the deficit to two once more but it was in vain. Algeria will progress to the last-16 for the first time in their history with a draw in their final game against Russia and would play the runners-up from the group containing Germany, USA, Ghana and Portugal. Sadness and joy: Algeria players celebrate (right) as Sofiane Feghouli (left) consoles Son (centre) Devastation: South Korea's Son slaps the ground in frustration after his side's 4-2 loss to Algeria . To put that achievement in context, this is Algeria’s fourth appearance at World Cup finals and they have just two previous wins to their name. Those both came in 1982 when they were denied progress to the knock-out phase by an outrageous bit of gamesmanship from West Germany and Austia in playing out a result that ensured they both progressed at the expense of the north Africans. Algeria exacting revenge on Germany 32 years later would usually be the stuff of fantasy. But, as we have seen, anything is possible in Brazil.","Slimani, Halliche and Djabou fire Algeria 3-0 up at half-time .

"Not only had Aussie sensation Nick Kyrgios set his sights on going far at Wimbledon this year, another of the 19-year-old’s key goals was to pass the 25,000-follower mark on Twitter. Kyrgios had 21,000 by the time he walked on court to face world No 1 Rafael Nadal on Tuesday. Twenty-four hours and one major upset later, he had 65,000  fans on the popular social network. Scroll down for video... Mr Popular: Nick Kyrgios saw his Twitter following blow up after upsetting Rafael Nadal at SW19 . The players are well-treated at the All England Club — and rightly so — with free food one of the perks of playing at the Championships. Pasta with cream and tomato sauce is  the dish most often ordered in the players’ restaurant, closely  followed by chicken and basmati rice. Players also receive a pair of tickets to a London theatre of their choice during the fortnight, the most popular show being The Lion King at the Lyceum Theatre. Circle of life: The Lion King is the most popular show among Wimbledon players . As if it were needed, three-time champion John Newcombe served a reminder of the long period of misery for British tennis when the topic was raised during a joint press conference with fellow Australian greats Rod Laver, Neale Fraser and Ken Rosewall. Newcombe said: ‘It’s a question that’s been asked ever since I’ve been coming over at the beginning of the Sixties. You haven’t come up with a real answer yet.’ As younger brother Andy struggled, Jamie Murray was on Court 18 to complete the victory in his mixed doubles opener with Aussie Casey  Dellacqua. Having stopped on Tuesday night at one set all, the pair returned to beat Jesse Huta Galung and Andreja Klepac 7-6, 6-7, 6-4. Mother Judy again chose to watch Jamie before taking her seat on Centre Court around 30 minutes into Andy’s match. Highs and lows: Judy Murray watched son Jamie win at mixed doubles before Andy's quarter-final defeat . Coach Melanie Molitor faced split loyalties on Court No 2 as she watched her 17-year-old charge Belinda Bencic take on daughter Martina Hingis in a thrilling third-round mixed doubles clash. Experience won in the end as Hingis and Bruno Soares edged past Bencic and Martin Klizan 6-3, 5-7, 9-7. Switzerland’s Bencic is one of the most exciting prospects on the women’s tour, having already reached No 71 in the world rankings. Maia Lumsden and Gabriella Taylor joined Katie Boulter in the third round of the girls’ singles with impressive straight-set victories. Lumsden, the 16-year-old from Glasgow, beat Dalma Galfi 7-5, 6-3, and takes on American Michaela  Gordon, who knocked out Lumsden’s fellow Scot Isabelle Wallace. Southampton’s Gabriella Taylor beat Tami Grende 6-4, 6-4. Boulter faces Tornado Alicia Black — whose younger sister is called Hurricane. Girl power: Maia Lumsden reached the third round of the junior singles event at SW19 . No American made it through to the last 16 of either the men’s or women’s singles here this year for the first time since 1911, but there is at least hope in  their junior ranks, with seven Americans reaching that stage in the boys’ singles. Francis Tiafoe, one of the USA’s hottest prospects, takes on compatriot Noah Rubin — no relation to former World No 6 Chanda.

"Nerves in a World Cup quarter final can get the better of any side - but Argentina are lucky that they had the best player left in the competition to calm theirs. It took their talismanic forward just eight minutes to open up Belgium and help to swing this tight tie in the South Americans' favour. Even his stoppage time one-on-one miss could not ruin the celebrations.

With his back to goal, Argentina's captain twisted and turned, left then right, and quickly escaped the attentions of Marouane Fellaini and Toby Alderweireld before slipping the ball to Angel Di Maria. From there, the ball reached Higuain who brilliantly volleyed in on the turn. And that was all it took - 1-0 and it looked so simple for Messi, leaving players from one of the World Cup's best defensive sides looking like statues. It was a tough afternoon for the creative players: Di Maria came off injured in the first half and Eden Hazard saw himself subbed as Belgium searched for an equaliser, but Messi still made the difference. He had a quiet second period but then so did most. And he still managed to be key for his country, dropping deeper into midfield where he completed 86.4% of his 22 passes.

"They used to call him the ‘Iron Tulip’ in Holland, a reference to a perceived inflexibility as well as a rigid self-confidence. As he prepares to head to the Barclays Premier League, however, they are going to have to come up with some new names for Louis van Gaal. During the three-and-a-half weeks of this World Cup in Brazil, the Dutch manager has emerged as one of the international game’s great innovators. His rotation of formations, tactics and his use of substitutes had grabbed the world’s attention even before his remarkable decision to throw reserve goalkeeper Tim Krul into Saturday night’s penalty shoot-out at Arena Fonte Nova. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Dutch a step closer to ending trophy drought . Innovative: Holland manager Louis van Gaal has been bold in his decision-making at the World Cup . Masterstroke: Van Gaal congratulates Tim Krul after he brought the goalkeeper on for a penalty shootout . Bold move: Goalkeeper Krul (right) replaced Jasper Cillessen for Holland's shootout win over Costa Rica . The only people who don’t seem to be the slightest bit surprised by any of this are his players. ‘I think you need to look at his resume,’ said former Manchester City midfield player Nigel de Jong. ‘He is a fantastic coach and I really do think he is one of a kind. Certainly he is in terms of his tactical changes and the calls he makes during games. That is all new to me.’ Great managers make ordinary players do great things and they make great players even better. It’s that simple and Van Gaal is ticking the boxes. For example, he has turned Dirk Kuyt from a fading centre forward into perhaps the most industrious wing back the international game has ever seen. Arjen Robben, meanwhile, looks ready to win a World Cup on his own while Wesley Sneijder found something of his 2010 self almost from nowhere against Costa Rica. It is often too easy to talk about squads with great togetherness and a sense of purpose. They all say they have it. Bend it: Wesley Sneijder has rediscovered his 2010-form under Van Gaal . Versatile: Van Gaal has deployed forward Dirk Kuyt as an industrious wing back during the World Cup . TIM KRUL (2006-14, before Costa Rica match) Penalties faced: 20 . Penalties saved: 2 (Frank Lampard 2011, David Dunn 2012) JASPER CILLESSEN (2010-14) Penalties faced: 14 (including 2 for Holland) Penalties saved: 0 . Here in Brazil, though, I have watched Holland - often so fractured at big tournaments - progress through this World Cup and now recognise a group of players not just committed to their manager, but also tuned into his methods almost sub-consciously. ‘We have a superb trainer,’ said Robben. ‘He is a coach who works magic like this all the time. He is the king. ‘Nobody knew about what he was going to do before the shootout apart from himself and one goalkeeper.’ The best 11: Holland's Arjen Robben is arguably the player of the tournament so far . Bunch of fives: Robben (left) slams home Holland's fifth goal in their stunning victory over Spain . Heading into the net: Robin van Persie hurls himself through the air to score a superb goal against Spain . Van Gaal’s decision to send on Krul for the penalties was perhaps a psychological trick as much as anything. Neither he nor indeed Dutch No 1 Jasper Cillessen have a particularly good record in shootouts. It is also a trick that has been used by coaches before. Never has it been tried when the stakes are so high, though. Had it failed, Van Gaal’s critics in the Netherlands - and he does have them - would have loaded their bullets and released the safety catch. Perhaps this is part of Van Gaal’s brilliance. Rarely has there been a coach so seemingly unfazed by opinion. It would be wrong to say the 62-year-old is oblivious because he clearly hears and sees absolutely everything. Ecstatic: Holland's players celebrate after Krul's heroics sent Van Gaal's side through to the semi-finals . Plaudits: Van Gaal has many critics in Holland but he will have won some over with his innovative approach . With Van Gaal, though, the feathers are seldom ruffled and the effect this has on his players is noticeable. ‘He has shown in many countries that he can do this job, but he has also convinced the players that his way can be successful and I think that is the key,’ said Kuyt. ‘We believe in him. He is calm so we are calm.’ Certainly, this is not the most gifted Dutch squad we have seen. Bert van Marwijk’s team four years ago was perhaps more talented. Happy Holland: Louis van Gaal high fives Van Persie after the forward's brilliant equaliser . This one, though, is increasingly fuelled by the belief that anything may just be possible here. In Robben they have the star of the tournament. The Bayern winger was sensational on Saturday and, on another night, would have led Holland to the comfortable victory much of their football deserved. His courage in the face of rudimentary Costa Rica tackling was admirable and should be remembered next time we criticise him for falling down too easily. The form of Robin van Persie, meanwhile, may worry Van Gaal a little ahead of Wednesday’s semi-final with Argentina in Sao Paulo. The Manchester United striker is short on timing and confidence, though he was still man enough to take Holland’s first penalty. But then again, does Van Gaal really worry about anything? If he does, he is hiding it well. ‘He has made us believe,’ said De Jong. ‘And if you don’t have belief, you will not reach anything.’ VIDEO Dutch a step closer to ending trophy drought . HOLLAND .

"Manchester City remain hopeful of signing central defender Eliaquim Mangala from Porto. The 23-year-old remains a priority for director of football Txiki Begiristain and manager Manuel Pellegrini and Sportsmail understands that City’s pursuit for the Frenchman will be accelerated following the player’s involvement at the World Cup in Brazil. City are understood to have been monitoring the player’s performances for almost eighteen months and he is considered to be the perfect partner for Vincent Kompany at the heart of the Manchester City defence. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Man City target Eliaquim Mangala scoring for Porto . On the move: Porto star Eliaquim Mangala (left) is set to join Manchester City this summer . City made a concerted effort to sign Mangala from the Portuguese side in January but they were unable to come to an agreement with Porto after they were quoted £50million for the double signing of midfielder Fernando and the defender. The club resolved to return for the pair this summer and they have since sealed the £12m purchase of Fernando and are now aiming to sign up his former team-mate. The deal could be worth in excess of £30m but City will face competition from Barcelona and PSG. On World Cup duties: Mangala chats to team-mate Lucas Digne during French training session .

"State-backed Lloyds Banking Group is to slash 9,000 jobs and shut 200 branches, it was announced today. The closures spell an end to the bank's commitment to be the 'last bank in town' and represent around a tenth of its network of 2,000 sites. Lloyds, which received a £20billion government bailout during the financial crisis - said customers will increasingly be expected to use online banking or self-service facilities within branches instead of dealing with staff face to face. Scroll down for video . Lloyds Banking Group is to close 150 branches over the next three years as it cuts around 9,000 jobs . Meanwhile, the group announced a 41% rise in underlying profits for the third quarter to £2.2 billion and said it remained confident in its plans to resume dividend payments after six years. Chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio said: 'The business is performing strongly and we are well positioned to continue to support and benefit from UK economic growth.' Bottom line pre-tax profits were £751 million, after taking into account an additional £900 million set aside to pay for the Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) mis-selling scandal, taking the running total to £11.3 billion. Three years ago Lloyds, which is 25% owned by the taxpayer after being rescued during the financial crisis, pledged to keeping total branch numbers at the same level but now says the commitment has expired. Mr Horta-Osorio said: 'Over the last three years the successful delivery of our strategy has ensured that we have become a safe, highly efficient, UK-focused retail and commercial bank. 'The next phase of our strategy will use these strong foundations as a basis for meeting the rapidly-changing needs of our customers, and sets out how we will grow the business in a way that will deliver increasing and sustainable returns for our shareholders.' Chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio insisted the move would be good for customers and shareholders . Finance director George Culmer said of the pledge to keep branches open: 'That was a specific commitment we made over the last planned period. We won't be able to commit to that going forward.' Lloyds said the move would see a net closure of 150 branches. Mr Culmer said Halifax branch numbers would be maintained and the business would add sites in Scotland where it currently has only three. Banking stocks continued to come under pressure today after Lloyds Banking Group announced a fresh £900 million provision to cover mis-selling claims. The latest sum for customers wrongly sold payment protection insurance (PPI) takes the bank's overall provision to more than £11 billion and came as Lloyds announced plans to cut 9,000 jobs over three years and close 200 branches. In a session when the FTSE 100 Index climbed 33.1 points to 6396.5, Lloyds shares were lower for a second session in row - down 1.8p at 73.5p. They also fell on Monday after the results of stress tests by the European Banking Authority raised concerns about the prospect of Lloyds announcing its first dividend payment in six years. It said more than 90% of Lloyds and Bank of Scotland customers would continue to have a 'useable branch' within five miles of their home. The group said it would target closures in town centres where it currently has more than one branch. Meanwhile, the 9,000 job cuts, around 10% of the current workforce, will fall throughout the business. Mr Culmer said: 'It is regrettable but this is about changing customer needs. We will work very, very hard to make sure that we lessen the impact as much as we possibly can on our people.' Lloyds said its new 'digitisation' strategy would see £1 billion invested in digital technology over the three-year period. The group is also targeting £1 billion cost savings by the end of 2017. It said: 'We will realign our branch capabilities to operate more efficiently, increasing self-service technology and investing in remote advice services, with an increasing number of counter transactions migrating to digital and self-service.' More than 10 million Lloyds Banking Group customers now bank online while five million use its mobile banking services. The group, which has around 25 million customers including people and businesses, saw a 9% fall in branch use last year as more people turned to the internet to carry out their day-to-day banking. At the same time, mobile banking use increased by 38%. Lloyds received a £20billion bailout from the government in 2008 and is still 25 per cent owned by taxpayers . Rob MacGregor, national officer of the Unite union, said: 'These are deeply unsettling times for Lloyds staff, who after days of speculation and leaks face yet another round of job cuts and a future of uncertainty. 'Job cuts of approximately 10% could have unknown consequences on customer service and will put even more pressure on staff who have helped get the bank back on the right track. 'The wallets of top executives at Lloyds should not be getting fat by forcing low-paid workers on to the dole. If there are compulsory redundancies or customer service suffers then executive pay should be cut.' Shares in the bank have been under pressure this week after the results of a European stress test to see how lenders would cope in maintaining the buffer of capital they hold in the event of a financial crisis. Lloyds passed the test but performed the least well among UK banks, adding to fears that it may struggle when details of a further exercise by the Bank of England are published in December. Mr Culmer expressed confidence that Lloyds would pass the test. But shares in the bank - also hit by the large additional PPI provision - fell 2%. The PPI increase came as complaints were higher than expectations. The finance director added: 'We would remain hopeful with regards to paying a dividend for 2014 full year.' December 2007 - Following run on Northern Rock in September 2007, Lloyds TSB says the credit crunch has cost it around £200million. October 2008 - Government ploughs £37billion in banking sector, buying stakes in Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), Lloyds TSB and HBOS. January 2009 - Lloyds takes over HBOS to become Lloyds Banking Group, which was then 43 per cent owned by the taxpayer. February 2009 - Lloyds reports 80 per cent fall in performance from previous year. November 2009 - Bank announces it is to sell off 600 branches with 5,000 jobs to go following £4billion half-year losses three months earlier. April 2010 - The bank says it has returned to profit in the first quarter. September 2010 - Santander's UK boss Antonio Horta-Osorio is brought in after bank stops selling controversial payment protection insurance amid mis-selling claims. March 2011 - New boss Antonio Horta-Osorio announces UK branch closures and a shake-up of the bank's insurance and retail divisions. May 2011 - Bank announces it is setting aside £3.2bn to cover PPI mis-selling claims and reports first quarter pre-tax losses of £3.5bn. June 2011 - A further 15,000 job losses are announced as the bank sets out plan to save £1.5billion a year by 2014. November 2011 - Mr Horta-Osorio takes a leave of absence after suffering from fatigue due to overwork. He returns to work two months later. February 2012 - The bank strips 13 executives of part of their 2010 bonuses following the PPI mis-selling scandal. February 2013 - Lloyds is fined £4.3m by the Financial Services Authority over delays to paying 140,000 customers PPI compensation payments. August 2013 - Lloyds announces half-year profits of £2.1billion, but the news is tempered by the revelation that its PPI bill has increased to £7.3bn. July 2014 - Sources say the Government's 24.9 per cent stake in Lloyds Banking Group could be sold off by the end of the year.","Company to cut 10 per cent of its workforce in move to 'digitise' bank .

"How to stop Lionel Messi ? It is a question that has confounded most teams facing Barcelona for the last 10 years. And in this tournament Messi has at last weaved his mesmerising magic for Argentina on a consistent basis. Swiss boss Ottmar Hitzfeld is a precise type of coach in his preparation and may consider the idea of man-marking Messi given the Swiss side’s preferred 4-3-1-2 formation. Former West Ham player Valon Behrami could be utilised in such a role. Main man: Lionel Messi controls the ball during an Argentina training session ahead of Tuesday's game . Perfect 10: Messi has scored four goals for Argeintina in this World Cup so far . VIDEO All Star XI: Lionel Messi - highlights . But former France World Cup winner Partick Vieira who suffered a chastening experience when he first came up against Messi on his Juventus debut after leaving Arsenal thinks that would be a wrong tactical move. 'It would be a huge mistake to man mark Messi,' said Vieira. 'He can just beat his marker or move and make openings for others. The only thing you can really do is give less space like Iran did. They played by getting close and being aggressive but late they got tired and dropped off him a little. That’s all he needed to score.' Of that first meeting when Messi was just 18, Vieira added: ‘I tried to kick him… I tried to scare him but every time you fouled him he put the ball down on the floor, took a free kick and was off again looking for the ball. Hard task: Valon Behrami (centre) could be charged with stopping Messi in the last-16 tie . 'He always shows real bravery and courage and plays for the team' There is something about left-footed players. The best of them wield their left leg like a magic wand and the right foot is often just there to balance on. Puskas, Maradona, Hagi were all masters and now of course there is Messi. All four of his goals at this World Cup have been scored with his left foot. Mind you, so far 54 goals - 36 per cent – of all goals in Brazil have been scored with the left peg. So far Belgium have lived up to their billing as the clever-money dark-horse tip. The USA though have shown the energy and attacking menace to put Mark Wilmots’ side to their test. And in football there is always a tipping moment when a run comes to an end. In the 20 games that keeper Thibaut Courtois has played for Belgium they have never lost. Is now the time? By the way, although Atletico Madrid want to extend his loan, Chelsea are set to take him back after the finals and make him their No 1. The Americans love dubbing their sports stars with sobriquets. So surely Michael Bradley, their 26-year-old midfielder son of former USA coach Bob and who plays for Toronto, should be called Marathon Man. In their first three group games he covered 23.6 miles . Germany squeezed through against Algeria as Brazil did with Costa Rica. Marathon man: Michael Bradley (right) has run huge distances to help USA into the knockout stages . Now it is Colombia against Brazil in the quarter-final and Germany vs France, which could mean a Brazil vs Germany semi-final. A World Cup classic in the making? Incredibly these two World Cup super-powers have only met once in its 84 year history - the 2002 final in Japan, which Brazil won 2-0 . I-Say . Despite some of the bad baggage that has come with this World Cup - bribery allegations about FIFA, betting rumours surrounding Ghana, match fixing claims surrounding Cameroon and, of course, Luis Suarez - on the pitch it has continued to be enthralling and dramatic continuing into the knockout stage. Even if some of the games have been tighter and more gruelling this is heading for the best finals in terms of the football since 1970. Let’s hope it continues and the enduring image of this tournament is the buena vistas of Brazil’s beaches and Joga Bonito on the pitch . World Cup Bet . Both Tuesday’s games look to be tight, so a draw double at 90 minutes could be on the cards. Argentina and Switzerland is 3-1 for the draw, while it’s 21-10 with Belgium and USA. But if you are feeling adventurous then Clint Dempsey to score and USA to win is 7-1. Messi to score first and Argentina to win is 7-2. One to Watch . Swiss front man Xherdan Shaqiri hit the 50th hat trick in World Cup history when the Swiss beat Honduras 3-0. He is the player who gives the robust hard working Swiss side a cutting edge.

France vs Germany’s quarter-final prompts memories of the semi-final clash between the two countries in 1982. It was an incredible match in Seville, which ended 3-3 with Germany winning on penalties, the first time a World Cup semi-final had been settled that way . But it is best remembered for the horror clash in which Germany keeper Harald Schumacher brutally took out France striker Patrick Battiston. It should have been a penalty and a red card - perhaps more, given how badly Battiston was bashed up - but Schumacher got off scott free.","Argentina take on Switzerland in World Cup last-16 clash on Tuesday .

"On Saturday afternoon in Brasilia, the host nation will walk out for a meaningless third place play-off in a World Cup they believed they were destined to win. The five gold stars on those famous strips — one for each World Cup won by Brazil — will be an embroidered reminder of their failure. These are footballers feted at home and abroad, paid millions in wages and endorsements, who live to play football in front of adoring fans. But on Saturday they would rather be anywhere else. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Scolari say Brazil will continue to be one of the world's best . Devastation: A tearful David Luiz is comforted by Thiago Silva after the Germany result that shook Brazil . Shame: Brazil fans cannot believe their eyes as Germany record the unbelievable result against the hosts . They have become a shameful entry on a timeline of footballing greats that stretches back to Pele, Rivelino, Tostao, Garrincha, Falcao and Zico. David Luiz, their inept captain on the night of the semi-final shame, Julio Cesar, Dante, Maicon, Marcelo, Fernandinho, Luis Gustavo, Hulk, Bernard, Fred and Oscar will be remembered for ever. They are the team who shamed a nation. In the hours after Tuesday night’s annihilation, Brazil’s shell-shocked players drifted towards a team bus that has ‘the sixth is coming’ splashed down  the side. Fred, the hapless striker who is a symbol for this sub-standard Brazil, admitted the 90-minute nightmare will never go away. ‘It is a scar that will forever live in all our lives,’ he said. Luiz, his eyes red raw with emotion, said sorry to the Brazilian nation: ‘I just wanted to see my people smile.’ Mental scars: Most of these players, and Fred in particular, will never be forgiven for this defeat . Deep-rooted: Brazil's media blamed Luiz Felipe Scolari's team but Gilberto thinks the problems are bigger . Speechless: Fernandinho admitted that he has never experienced anything like the 7-1 defeat . ‘We cannot find the words to explain this situation,’ admitted Manchester City midfielder Fernandinho. There is talk of the psychological recovery within the Brazil camp and yet it will take more than a few visits to spiritualist Regina Brandao to soothe the pain. ‘We have three or four days to take some rest and think about the next game, but I’ve never experienced anything like it,’ added Fernandinho. There were some obvious fissures in the team, particularly when Luiz Felipe Scolari — who won’t decide his future until after Saturday’s match —addressed his players in a huddle in the moments after the final whistle. Many of them were snarling at each other before Scolari ordered them to applaud the Brazil supporters. Misplaced passion: Brazil will have to go out and play again on Saturday in a game none of them will want . Scolari looked his 65 years, a man who won one World Cup in 2002 and lost another in 18 mad minutes. ‘It’s not easy to begin speaking about this,’ added Fernandinho. There will be more tears and another rousing rendition of Hinero Nacional Brasileiro before the game they can’t play quickly enough. It will be a very public shaming.","Brazil thrashed 7-1 by Germany in World Cup semi-final .

Spain did clock up 1,574 passes in their three matches but the old sparkle was missing and they bombed out in the group stages. The . much-admired Kroos, who has been linked with a succession of big . European clubs this year, successfully completed 360 of his 394 . attempted passes - an accuracy ratio of 91 per cent. He is joined in the top five by team-mates Philipp Lahm and Per Mertesacker, cogs in the well-oiled German passing machine.

SHOTS-TO-GOALS CONVERSION . Colombia have been the revelation of the tournament so far and quarter-final opponents Brazil will have to be well-drilled given their deadly accuracy in front of goal. Jose Pekerman's team score with three out of every 10 shots and their rising star James Rodriguez has a conversion ratio of 62.5 per cent. With five goals to date, including that wonderful volley against Uruguay, he is leading the race for the Golden Boot ahead of pre-tournament favourites Neymar, Lionel Messi and Thomas Muller. Interestingly, Neymar and Muller have precisely the same record - with a conversion rate of 36.4 per cent.

Louis van Gaal's team have been free-flowing throughout the tournament, notably when they put five goals past defending champions Spain in their opening match. Arjen Robben, who scored twice that night, hit the target with 88.9 per cent of his shots, the second highest of all the players. It won't surprise you that James Rodriguez, Neymar, Mario Gotze and Oscar also feature in this particular top 10, but Giovani dos Santos of Mexico is the only one who found the target with every one of his chances.

Shooting accuracy by player . Shooting accuracy by team . VIDEO Team Profile: Netherlands & qualifying highlights . SHOTS ON TARGET . Belgium's 'Golden Generation' were always fancied to perform well at this tournament and they have proved their class by reaching the last eight. They've also fired in the most shots on target, with 32 in their four matches so far. However, only six of these have actually gone in. Compare that with France, whose 31 shots on target have yielded 10 goals. Their striker Karim Benzema has been responsible for 13 of these efforts. Radar: France's Karim Benzema has had 13 shots on target during the World Cup, more than any other player . Shots on target by player . Shots on target by team . SHOTS OFF TARGET . Argentina haven't been at their peak in this tournament so far and they've been guilty of squandering a lot of chances. They have racked up 34 shots off target, showing that although Lionel Messi, Javier Mascherano and company can create openings at will, they're not too successful at converting them. In the players' chart, Asamoah Gyan of Ghana had the most wayward shots with 10. Squandered: Ghana's Asamoah Gyan fired 10 shots off target during his team's three group games . Shots off target by player . Shots off target by team . HIT WOODWORK .

Antoine Griezmann and Yohan Cabaye were denied by the post or bar twice each. Unlucky: France's Yohan Cabaye has seen two shots rebound back off the woodwork . Hit woodwork by player . Hit woodwork by team . ASSISTS . As mentioned earlier, Colombia have been very impressive during this tournament and while James Rodriguez takes most of the plaudits, they should also be warmly thanking Juan Guillermo Cuadrado. He has contributed four assists so far. Holland's Daley Blind has set up three during their run to a quarter-final with Costa Rica. Architect: Colombia's Juan Guillermo Cuadrado (centre) has contributed four assists during the tournament . Creator: Holland's Daley Blind (right) has set up three of his team's goals . Assists . CHANCES CREATED . He was under enormous pressure to perform at this World Cup and Lionel Messi certainly hasn't let anyone down. As well as his four goals, he has created 18 chances with those twinkling toes. A spare part at Bayern, Xherdan Shaqiri of Switzerland has put himself in the shop window with a number of fine displays and he set up 17 chances. Magician: Lionel Messi prepares to create another chance for Argentina - he managed 18 in four matches . Impressive: Xherdan Shaqiri of Switzerland created 17 chances for his team . VIDEO All Star XI: Lionel Messi . Chances created . CROSSES .

Another Argentine, Marcos Rojo, has put in 23 balls, while Di Maria has also taken 17 corners. Crossing king: Angel Di Maria has delivered more crosses than anyone else at the World Cup . Crosses by player . Crosses by team . DRIBBLES . No prizes for guessing who tops the leaderboard in this category. Lionel Messi is certainly not afraid to carry the Argentina attack, as shown by 41 dribbles in the tournament to date. His most telling was the dazzling run that teed up Di Maria for the decisive goal against the Swiss. Another man with the weight of the world on his shoulders, Brazil's Neymar, has cut loose 36 times, while Chile's ever-impressive Alexis Sanchez went on a run on 35 occasions. Samba skills: Neymar charges forward to launch another Brazil attack . Hands on: Sometimes this was the only way to deal with Chile's Alexis Sanchez . Dribbles by player . Dribbles by team . TACKLES . We're more used to seeing him score spectacular goals for Chelsea, but Oscar isn't afraid to get stuck in either. The Brazil star has made 21 tackles in the competition so far, putting him on a par with Argentina's Javier Mascherano. The insatiable desire of Brazil and Argentina to have possession means they are first and second in the overall team chart with 94 and 93 respectively. Getting stuck in: Brazil's Oscar tackles Cameroon's Landry Nguemo during their group stage meeting . Tackles made by player . Tackles made by team . CLEARANCES . Gary Medel, nursing a thigh injury, was heroic in Chile's loss to Brazil and, given the brave rearguard action they mounted, it's not a surprise to find him top of the clearances table with 40. That was one ahead of America's Matt Besler (39). The USA cleared the ball 165 times in all during their four matches, far more than anyone else. Away! Gary Medel (bottom) with yet another clearance during Chile's last-16 defeat by Brazil . Clearances by player . Clearances by team . SAVES MADE . There have been some glorious goalkeeping performances at this World Cup and Tim Howard has been particularly impressive. The American stopper made a total of 27 saves in their four games. Nigeria's Vincent Enyeama (22), Algeria's Rais M'Bolhi (20) and Switzerland's Diego Benaglio (20) have also caught the eye with their shot-stopping.

"Two schoolboy brothers have been scarred for life after temporary tattoos burnt into their skin on an Easter Holiday from hell. Liam, 16, and Owen Groves, 14, pestered their mother to allow them to have henna body art while on an all-inclusive holiday in Egypt. But instead of natural henna the tattoo artist, who worked in the resort where they were staying, used super-strength black henna. Warning graphic content . Liam Groves, 16, got a tattoo using 'black henna' while on holiday in Egypt but was left permanently scarred after chemical in the dye burned into his skin . Younger brother Owen, 13, suffered a similar reaction. Unlike henna, which is a natural plant dye which turns the skin dark brown, 'black henna' is synthetic and often made with hair dye which burns the skin . While henna itself is a harmless natural product used to turn the skin dark brown, 'black' henna is usually made using hair dye which contains harmful chemicals which burn the skin. On the plane home Liam and Owen couldn't stop itching and had to be pulled out of school when they returned to the UK as the patterns turned into sores. The dodgy tattoos have permanent scars on their backs and the brothers now can't take their tops off in the sun as doctors warned to avoid direct sunlight on the area. Their furious mother Alison, 48, yesterday warned other parents thinking of letting their kids have holiday tattoos to think twice. The tattoos were initially fine but began itching on the way home and eventually turned into large sores . Mother Alison described her anger after the boys got the tattoos from someone working in their holiday resort . The full-time mother said: 'The boys had been asking for henna tattoos and I gave in and we had them done by the man running the gift shop in the hotel. 'We sat in the gift shop whilst he did them. Now I wish I had never let them have them done. 'As a parent I was mortified and devastated by what I saw. They had pussed and swelled up massively. 'I wish I had never let the boys have them. It was a huge mistake. I would ask any other parent to think twice before letting their children have them done.' The mother, who has been locked in a three-year legal battle, added: 'I can't believe it has dragged on this long. The pain and suffering my boys have been through I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. 'But all that is compounded by Virgin and their reaction. Their behaviour has been awful and that have treated us with contempt throughout this process. 'They are in the wrong but they think they can drag this out and we will just go away. But it's just not right that they can allow this sort of thing to go on in their resorts then cover it up as if nothing ever happened.' The family went for a week-long stay at the Movenpick El Solhna, in Egypt in April 2011, when Liam was 13 and Owen was just 11. Since going on the holiday in 2011 (pictured) Alison has been locked in a legal battle with Virgin Holidays . Owen (left) and Liam were just 11 and 13 when the tattoos were done while the family were in Egypt . Alison, of Standon, Herts., said: 'I took the boys to our doctor who said they were experiencing a reaction to the chemical PPD[Para-Penilen-Diammine] which is used in black henna. 'He diagnosed contact dermatitis and they were given a steroid cream and moisturiser to assist with the healing and discomfort. 'The tattoos looked horrific and had blistered terribly and were causing a lot of distress and sleepless nights.' The boys were prescribed steroid cream to bring the swelling down but it did nothing to help . But seven months later the tattoos still had not healed and she had to take them to a specialist dermatologist. She added: 'Despite all the time the scars were still visible and he believed it would take several more months for the reaction to settle completely. 'It was a horrible experience for us all to go through. The boys because of the pain and discomfort and scarring, and as parents, seeing the boys in so much stress and not knowing what had happened to their skin. 'Even now they cant go out in the sun properly as if they get heat on the areas where the tattoos were they come out again faint and it really hurts then both.' The boys have now been told they will not be able to have a permanent tattoo, dye their hair or have piercings because of the reactions they suffered. The family's solicitor Nick Harris, head of travel law at Simpson Millar solicitors, said: 'People assume, when they stay at an all-inclusive resort, that the facilities provided will be safe to use. 'It is disgraceful that UK Tour Operators continue to allow Henna tattoo artists to operate within these resorts unchecked knowing that the ink they're using can lead to horrific scarring and disfigurement.' A Virgin Holidays spokesman said: 'Virgin Holidays were concerned to learn of the reaction that these customers experienced following the henna tattoos they had during their holiday to Egypt in 2011. 'Virgin Holidays takes the well-being of all of its customers very seriously. However, as this matter is the subject of ongoing legal proceedings we're unable to comment further.'","Brothers Liam, 16, and Owen Groves, 14, had tattoos on holiday .

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott wants to develop a 'red card' system to stop 'hate preachers' from groups like Hizb ut-Tahrir from coming into Australia. The radical Islamic group will hold a lecture against United States-led combat in Syria in  Lakemba, south west of Sydney, on Friday night. Mr Abbott says the group is engaged in 'hate preaching' and members should not be allowed to enter Australia to attend such events. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott wants to develop a 'red card' system to stop 'hate preachers' from groups like Hizb ut-Tahrir from coming into Australia . 'By all means let Australians who want to say stupid things to say stupid things but there's no point importing troublemakers from overseas to stir people up,' he told Macquarie Radio on Wednesday. 'I am sorry we haven't red-carded these hate preachers before but it will happen and it will happen quickly.' Mr Abbott said the current law doesn't allow the government to ban Hizb ut-Tahrir unless the group engages in terrorism, even though it campaigns against Australian values. New laws to be introduced before the end of the year will also make it illegal to promote terrorism. Mr Abbott said the current law doesn't allow the government to ban Hizb ut-Tahrir unless the group engages in terrorism . Friday's lecture, titled The War to End a Blessed Revolution, will accuse the US of attacking the 'noble Syrian revolution' by entering Iraq. 'America has initiated yet another war, rounding up its puppets and allies to attack the Syrian revolution, while using intervention in Iraq as a convenient excuse,' the lecture's brochure says. It comes after the group protested in Lakemba with signs reading 'terror raids cannot break the spirit of Muslims' and 'stop terrorising Muslims' following counter-terrorism raids last month. The radical Islamic group will hold a lecture against United States-led combat in Syria in Lakemba, south west of Sydney, on Friday night . The United States is leading an international coalition in a combat mission to suppress the activities of extremist group Islamic State. Australia has begun air combat missions in Iraq but is yet to drop any bombs. A 200-member unit of Australian special forces is awaiting approval to head into Iraq to advise and assist the local military. Mr Abbott says Australia has no plans to enter Syria and is in Iraq at the request of the Iraqi government.","Islamic group Hizb ut-Tahrir will hold a lecture against US-led combat in Syria in Sydney's Lakemba on Friday .

"Liverpool midfielder Luis Alberto has joined Malaga on a season-loan after struggling to make an impact in his first year at Anfield. The 21-year-old made just two starts and 10 substitute appearances after an £8million move from Sevilla last summer but manager Brendan Rodgers is not prepared to give up on the youngster just yet and hopes he will gain more first-team experience with the Spanish club. A Liverpool statement read: 'Liverpool today confirmed that midfielder Luis Alberto has completed a season-long loan switch to Spanish outfit Malaga. Move: Liverpool midfielder Luis Alberto has signed for Malaga on a season-long loan . Peripheral: Alberto (left) made just two starts last season for the Anfield club . 'The 21-year-old, who arrived at Anfield from Sevilla last summer, will spend the entirety of 2014-15 with the side that finished 11th last season.' Rodgers is still trying to add to his summer signings of England and Southampton striker Rickie Lambert and Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Emre Can but appears to have failed in the bid to sign Sevilla left-back Alberto Moreno after the sides failed to agree a fee. The Europa League winner, 21, has been tracked for some time and although negotiations were lengthy the two have been 'miles apart' on their valuations of the player with the Spaniards looking for £20million. 'The matter of Alberto is practically settled. We couldn't reach an agreement and I don't think it can be revived,' Sevilla's sporting director Monchi told Spanish newspaper El Correo de Andalucia. 'It was great offer but the player is only 21 years old and it's possible that the catharsis of being with the national team had a positive effect. 'He has a lot of room to grow and the coach is very happy to have him. Experience: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers hopes Alberto gets game time at Malaga . 'I don't think we'll make a lot of moves but if on August 14 a club comes along and they give you a mountain of cash, well....I know you don't like to hear it, but we are economic managers. 'My feeling is that the negotiations are paralysed and I don't see any hint that they will be restarted. 'We put a price on our players which we believe to be appropriate. Whoever wants to buy, can buy, and if you can't.... 'Also, with the sale of Ivan Rakitic (to Barcelona) our needs were covered. We don't have the (financial) burden we had at other times.'","Alberto signed for Liverpool for £8million last summer .

"The New South Wales government has netted $2.27 million after selling the fifth terrace at Millers Point, an inner-city suburb of Sydney, on Thursday night. The heritage-listed property at 86 Windmill Street sold at auction for over half a million more than the price  quoted to potential buyers at inspection. The three-levelled terrace offers a slight view of Sydney's Harbour Bridge and is located on a local park called 'The Paddock'. The state government has netted $2.27 million after selling the fifth terrace at Millers Point, an inner-city suburb of Sydney, on Thursday night . The property embraces a 1880s design with modern finishes, a functional gas kitchen and is filled with natural light. It features separate lounge and dining areas and an attic located on the top floor. Although the property is immediately liveable, the property requires  full renovation. But the run-down property did not stop a crowd of 70 pre-registered bidders from flocking to Di Jones head office in Woollahra. The bidders were expected to bring photo identification on the night of the auction. The bidding started at $1 million but swiftly increased in increments of $100,000 and was called to the market once it hit $2.25 million mark, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. The new owner of the property is supposedly an investor who  attended the two previous Millers Point auctions. All five state government properties at Millers Point have sold for well above the price guides and have seen the New South Wales government pocket just under $13.4 million. The remarkable sale results could see Millers Point as Sydney's next prestige suburb, according to real estate agents. 'The sales agents received more than 1370 enquiries, conducted around 200 property inspections and issued over 70 pre-auction contracts', said Dominic Perrottet, the Minister for Finance and Services.
