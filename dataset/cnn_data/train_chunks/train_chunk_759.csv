David Cameron today warned that trade unions present a 'threat to the economy' as he prepares to call in the armed forces to fill in for striking public sector workers. But the Prime Minister faced claims that the strike-breaking idea will have 'serious consequences' for members of the armed forces and their families. Ministers are in talks with service chiefs about how troops could cover for fuel taker drivers, firefighters, immigration staff, train and tube drivers and prison officers. David Cameron told the Commons that the trade unions present a 'threat to the economy'. They hope to replicate the success of the military protecting the public at the London Olympics after security firm G4S failed to recruit enough staff. Union leaders have voted to explore the “practicalities” of a general strike for the first time since 1926. David Cameron told the Commons today: 'The trade unions do provide a threat to our economy. 'They threatened a strike to stop our fuel supplies, they threatened a strike to disrupt the Olympics, now they threaten a strike to wreck the economy.' He . said Labour had received £12m since Ed Miliband became leader 'from the . three unions who are now threatening a general strike' and said the party . should turn down future donations if industrial action goes ahead. The success of the military being called in to fill security shortfalls for the Olympics in London means they are to be put on standby to cover for public sector strikes. 'I do hope that these trade unions who are meeting and discussing this appalling idea of a general strike think again and think of the economy rather than their own self interest.' But there are concerns among the military about the practicalities of covering for walkouts, as the forces face pay and job cuts. Up to 17,000 jobs are due to be cut from the forces as part of the Strategic Defence and Security Review. Tory MP Penny Mordaunt, a member of the Commons defence select committee, today warned of the impact on members of the military and their families. Tory MP Penny Mordaunt said the strike contingency plans would have 'serious consequences' for troops and their families. ‘We have to keep the country going, . to keep public services running, but there are serious consequences for . armed forces in terms of both their rest time and their training,' she told MailOnline. 'The armed forces have a pay freeze and are having to look after morale in the face of massive reorganisation. ‘It is incredibly disruptive to the armed forces. I know they will rise to the challenge but one of the effects if you do have strikes – which will obviously be incredibly damaging for the country – is we are applying further stress on to these troops. David Cameron has held talks with Francis Maude, the Cabinet Office minister, over how the military could be used in the event of widespread industrial action. ‘The use of the Armed Forces to step . in where there are strikes is a very political decision,’ former head of . the Army, General Sir Mike Jackson told The Times. ‘By general acclaim the Armed . Services were seen by the public to have done a pretty good job at the . Olympics. It had the additional bonus that the relations between the . Armed Services and the public have become stronger due to the job they . did at the Olympics.’ The last time Downing Street revealed the army was on standby to fill in for striking workers, when petrol tanker drivers threatened to walk out in March, it sparked panic buying and severe shortages. General Sir Mike Jackson (left) a former head of the Army, warned that a plan by Francis Maude (right) to use troops to cover for public sector strikes was a 'very political decision . Mr Maude added to the chaos when he told  drivers: ‘As and when it makes sense, a bit of extra fuel in a jerry can is a sensible precaution to take.’ The need for contingency measures heightened yesterday after the TUC conference in Brighton voted to consider the practicalities of a general strike opposing the government’s austerity drive. Steve Gillan, leader of the Prison Officers Association, which proposed the idea, said there had to be a 'robust' response, adding: 'It does not mean we will have a general strike tomorrow, but we should have that in our armoury, because this Government is not afraid or embarrassed to do what it is doing to society. 'We need to make up our mind which direction we are going in, and we should not be afraid to to mention the words general strike."" All members of the forces are to be put on seven days’ notice to cover for any emergency, The Times also reported. The army has previously been trained to use Green Goddess fire engines to step in when firefighters went on strike. Speaking during the Olympics, Mr Cameron praised the military’s role in providing security. ‘For the country's sake, I'm sure it was the right decision to call up almost more troops than we needed to make doubly certain that there wouldn't be any hiccups,’ the PM said. It is not thought that members of the armed forces will be asked to cover for all public sector workers in the event of strikes. In particular, walk outs by nurses, doctors or teachers. The National Union of Teachers has voted to go on strike over the 'erosion' of their pay and working conditions. Outgoing TUC general secretary Brendan Barber has tried to play down the threat of a general strike. Outgoing TUC general secretary Brendan Barber has tried to play down the threat of a general strike. 'It would have enormous industrial and political implications,' he said. A Government spokesman said: ‘It is disappointing that some union leaders insist on pushing for irresponsible and futile strike action which benefits no one. 'As we have said time and again, pension talks will not be reopened and nothing further will be achieved through strike action. ‘The Government took the tough decision to freeze public sector pay for two years, while protecting those earning under £21,000 by increasing their pay by at least £250 per year. ‘Pay restraint has helped to protect jobs in the public sector and support high quality public services. 'As always in the event of any industrial action rigorous contingency planning would be in place across all sectors to minimise the impact of any strike and to ensure that key public services remain open.'","Ministers ask military chiefs to prepare to cover for prison workers, immigration staff and train drivers .

Four first responders who rescued a golden retriever from the icy waters of the Charles River outside of Boston last month were forced to decline a Caribbean vacation given to them by daytime talk show host Ellen DeGeneres as a reward for their selfless actions, which ultimately saved the dog's life. Wellesley, Massachusetts Fire Capt. Jim Dennehy, Lt. Paul Delaney, Dave Papazian, and Joan Cullinan each were given a bedazzled life vest with their name on it by the host, as well as a cruise through the Caribbean. However, the heroes were forced to turn down the vacation due to ethics laws regarding gifts for municipal employees. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Denied: Four first responders were not allowed to accept a cruise from Ellen for saving a dog because it violated state ethics laws . Grateful: The dog's owner, Amy Kapinos, is extremely grateful to the first responders for saving her beloved dog . Shocked: The firefighters were stunned when Ellen told them she was sending them on a Caribbean vacation . 'It was a nice gesture on Ellen’s part and the firefighters were surprised by that, but state statute is very clear, so we FedExed the vouchers back to the Ellen show,' Wellesley Fire Chief Richard DeLorie told Boston.com. On December 22, authorities received a frantic 911 call about a dog trapped in the ice in the Charles River. Wellesley rescuers tracked the panicked owner's cell phone GPS data to an isolated stretch of river in the Elm Bank Reservation. There they found a golden retriever named Crosby swimming for her life, stuck 40 yards from shore in the frigid water. Captivating: Dramatic video shows the daring rescue of a golden retriever trapped in the icy Charles River in Massachusetts . The cell phone data 'was absolutely critical in directing first responders to the correct area,' according to a Wellesly Police release. Five-year-old Crosby was stuck in a tiny circle of broken ice, unable to paddle to shore after unseasonably warm temperatures had thinned the previously solid ice over the weekend. Papazian jumped into action by donning a cold water survival suit and heading straight through the dangerously cold water and ice toward the ailing canine.

Police said Crosby was in remarkably good shape when she got to land and footage shows her looking grateful as firefighters dried her off. Still cold, damp and shaken, Crosby was reunited with her owner, Amy Kapinos, a short time later. 'Crosby is a big part of our family but they didn’t hesitate one second,' Kapinos said during a taping of the Ellen Show. 'I can't thank them enough.' Crosby was plucked from the river cold and unhappy but in good shape considering her close brush with death .

Centre stage:Laura Wright performed both the English and Scottish national anthems before the Six Nations game at Twickenham yesterday . With her nerve-racking appearance singing to 81,000 Six Nations fans out of the way, you might imagine soprano Laura Wright would have had enough of rugby for one weekend. But today she will be back on the pitch – only this time the elegant thigh-slit dress and heels will be ditched for boots and a mud-spattered kit. And the crowd? About 50, weather permitting. For not only is the 22-year-old the national anthem singer for the England side, she also plays full-back for Rosslyn Park Ladies - the aptly named ‘Slingbacks’ -  in South-West London. And Laura admits that whether she’s singing at Twickers or running out at Rosslyn Park, the butterflies still kick in. ‘I get nervous for both, believe it or not.’ It probably won’t be a capacity crowd . for the Rosslyn Park ladies match against Blackheath today – and a . water-logged pitch was threatening to scrap the fixture, but Laura has . got the rugger bug. ‘I’m used to standing in a concert hall . on my own, but playing rugby gives me the opportunity to be part of a . team so we can celebrate together or support each other if we lose!’ she . told the Mail on Sunday. Laura, who has twice sung at Wembley . Stadium and performed for the Queen said she does not let fear of being . hurt on the field curb her love of the game. ‘I’m not the kind of person to live life carefully,’ she said. ‘It is full-on contact rugby I play.’ ‘It’s a different feeling stepping out onto a pitch in a glamorous dress and heels compared to boots and gumshield,’ said Laura. ‘From playing rugby, I definitely . found even more respect for professional sportsmen and how focused . dedicate you must be.’ Laura added: ‘I’m all about live . performances, for me it is live or not at all. As a fan, I’d feel . cheated if someone mimed in a stadium. Pitch perfect: But the soprano will today turn out for her local rugby side Rosslyn Park Ladies in South-West London, potentially watched by a mere 50 spectators . ‘At Twickenham, it is incredibly hard to hear yourself, there is a lot of background noise, but a real buzz to peform. ‘I see my role as an opportunity to build interest in the women’s game.’ Her appointment as the official anthem . ‘voice’ last year came as something of a shock for her main rival Camilla Kerslake, who also happens to be the girlfriend of . England XV captain Chris Robshaw. Miss Kerslake, 24, was born in London but has a Welsh . mother and a Kiwi father. She has sung at four England . games at Twickenham as well as royal charity concerts.

An 11-year-old boy who was kicked out of the classroom for having a VW logo shaved into the back of his head was taken out of school for a week by his mother who branded the decision 'ridiculous'. Zac Eccleston was chucked out of classes and put into isolation at Camborne Science and International Academy in Cornwall after he turned up with the new haircut. The year 7 pupil had been treated to the £15 haircut by his step-grandfather over the Christmas holidays and opted for that particular design because of his love of the Volkswagen brand. Zac Eccleston, 11, from Camborne, Cornwall, was taken out of school for a week by his angry mother who said it was 'ridiculous' he was put into isolation for his £15 VW haircut . However, when he went back to school after the festive break, he was immediately banished to isolation and forced to work on his own for not complying with school uniform rules. His mother, Charlotte, immediately collected her son and kept him off school for a week until she met with staff at the school to resolve the situation. The 28-year-old hairdresser, of Camborne, Cornwall, said: 'It's ridiculous. It's clear there's a school uniform policy but a haircut isn't a uniform. 'By 8.45am last Monday they had rang and told me he was going to be put in isolation. I said ""no you're not"" and went and picked him up. 'The minute we got home he burst into tears. He was chuffed with his hair over Christmas and then all this happened when he went back and it knocked him down. He was gutted. 'He was hurt to think he'd been put into isolation and for something so trivial. It is not right that he had to sit in a room by himself because of a haircut.  I kept him off because I'm not having my son treated as a prisoner.' Mother Charlotte Eccleston, left, said she 'didn't want her son to be treated like a prisoner' after 11-year-old Zac, right, was put into isolation for his VW shaved hairstyle . Zac's stepdad, Jamie Betteley, said the decision to put the youngster in isolation over a haircut was 'pathetic'. The 31-year-old said: 'It's not fair to put him in a room on his own. A haircut doesn't affect his learning. It's just pathetic. 'He had stars shaved into the back of his head when he was around nine or 10 and no one at his primary school said anything then so we didn't think it would be a problem this time around.' Mr Betteley also said the ordeal wouldn't stop his stepson having another unique hairstyle in future. He said: 'He'll probably have another one again... it will just be in the six week summer holiday next time.' Camborne Science and International Academy in west Cornwall said the 'extreme' haircut was completely against the school's uniform policy . Zac, 11, right, had all of last week off school after his mother Charlotte, right, said he could stay off until he was allowed back into normal classrooms instead of being banished to isolation . However, Mark Fenlon, vice-principle at Camborne Science and International Academy in west Cornwall, said the school uniform policy was clear to both pupils and parents. He said: 'Parents and students are aware of the high standards and there are no . exceptions. The decision to remove Zac from school was not ours.' The vice-principle also upheld that hairstyles were 'very much a part of the school uniform policy'. He said: 'Hairstyles are absolutely part of school uniform and we don't accept extreme haircuts. 'Camborne Science and International Academy is the top performing state school in Cornwall and we believe our school uniform policy is one of the factors that makes us such a good school and one of choice for our parents.' Inspired: 11-year-old Zac decided to get the £15 haircut while visiting family in Wrexham, Wales, and chose the VW logo because of his love of the Volkswagen brand . Zac returned to school on Monday after having last week off and was allowed to resume learning in the classroom with other pupils after his mum met with teachers. Ms Eccleston, who said she hadn't shaved her son's hair to get rid of the hairstyle because it would've 'stood out' even more, said it was in the process of growing out and said she was glad he had been allowed to return to normal classes instead of isolation. Mr Fenlon said: 'I've met with his mum and she has complied with the rules and the hairstyle has grown out.'","Zac Eccleston, 11, of Camborne, Cornwall, was put into isolation for the £15 haircut .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 15:07 EST, 5 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 17:38 EST, 5 March 2014 . The trial against Osama bin Laden’s son-in-law has begun with prosecutors describing how he served as a motivational speaker for jihadists and agreed to be the public face of al Qaeda as soon as the planes hit the towers on September 11, 2001. Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, whose trial began in a federal court in Manhattan on Wednesday, was portrayed both as a murderous mouthpiece for al Qaeda and as a target of a prosecution designed to play on fears and resentments from the terror attacks. In opening statements, Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Lewin told the jury that bin Laden had summoned Abu Ghaith on the afternoon of September 11 and asked him to use his oratory skills as the public face of al Qaeda to recruit and inspire recruits to attack the United States again. Public face: Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, Osama bin Laden's son-in-law, agreed to be the spokesman for al Qaeda and sat beside the terror leader during their statement on September 12 praising the fatal attack . Abu Ghaith is the highest-ranking al Qaeda figure to face trial on U.S. soil since suicide attackers struck the city's twin towers. 'While our buildings still burned, he agreed... in what is the most important moment in al Qaeda's savage history,' Lewin said, showing jurors a photo of Abu Ghaith sitting side-by-side with bin Laden in Afghanistan on September 12, 2001. 'He invoked his twisted view of Islam and declared, ""Fight thee against the friends of Satan. Fight with al Qaeda against America.""' Defense attorney Stanley Cohen countered by pointing out that Lewin referenced the September 11 attack several times in his opening, even though his client wasn't involved in the plot. 'This is not Osama bin Laden,' Cohen said, pointing to Abu Ghaith. Western attire: Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, center, is flanked by his legal team Monday, March 3, 2014 during jury selection at the start of his trial in New York on charges that he conspired to kill Americans and support terrorists in his role as spokesman . Beginning: The opening arguments were heard Wednesday and the trial is expected to last about a month . 'This is Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, a Muslim, an Arab from Kuwait, a husband, a father, an imam, a talker, an ideologue.' The defendant, who wore a suit and tie to court, listened through an Arabic interpreter and occasionally took notes. Abu Ghaith, 48, a onetime imam at a Kuwaiti mosque, was brought to New York from Turkey last year. He has pleaded not guilty to charges he conspired to kill Americans after the September 11 attacks and provided material support and resources to a terrorist organization. Born in Kuwait, he is married to bin Laden's eldest daughter, Fatima. Prosecutors allege Abu Ghaith began his rise through the ranks of al Qaeda by becoming a motivational speaker at safe houses and training camps for aspiring jihadists in the weeks and months before September 11. Afterward, bin Laden instructed him to lead recruitment efforts by appearing in widely distributed videos. 'For more than a year after, the defendant used the murderous power of his words to try to strengthen al Qaeda,' Lewin said. Rhetoric: Abu Ghaith, center, was recorded sending messages to jihadists and is believed to have had prior knowledge about failed shoe bomb attacks that were planned- and thwarted- after September 11 . He quoted the defendant several times, including one remark he said came weeks after the attack: 'These young men who have destroyed the United States and launched the storm of airplanes against it have done a good deed. The storm of airplanes will not abate.' The government contends the statements are evidence that Abu Ghaith had prior knowledge of the failed shoe-bomb airline attack by Richard Reid in December 2001 and another plot to down a flight from Paris to Miami with explosives hidden in shoes. Prosecutors are expected to introduce testimony via video feed of another former al Qaeda member in Great Britain who was in on the shoe-bomb plot. Prosecuters also promised that they will be playing a taped confession later in the trial. Abu Ghaith is allegedly heard telling how he helped recruit jihadists for the terrorist organization. The tape was allegedly obtained by FBI agents when he was being transported from Jordan to the United States last year. Cohen told jurors that they might feel outrage over some of the 'dumb' and 'stupid' statements made by his client. But he urged jurors to keep open minds. 'At the end of the day, there's really no evidence,' Cohen said. 'There is the substitution for evidence with fright and alarm.' The first witness Wednesday was an FBI agent who traveled the world investigating al Qaeda before and after the September 11 attacks. The trial is expected to last about a month.

Just one day before her life was tragically cut short, camera assistant Sarah Jones told her parents she was worried about the shoot and the competence of those in charge. In a new interview, parents Richard and Elizabeth Jones open up about their daughter's concerns, legacy, and how they're dealing with the heart-breaking loss. Jones was hit by a freight train in Georgia last week during pre-production of the Greg Allman biopic 'Midnight Rider,' Worried: Jones parents said she was concerned over how experienced her bosses were and was nervous about the shoot only a day before the accident that took her life . 'She was a little nervous,' father Richard Jones told The Hollywood Reporter. 'She made a comment that some of the people asking her questions should have known more than her.' In the interview Richard describes the last message he ever received from his 27-year-old daughter. 'She was excited about meeting and . working with William Hurt. That's the last text I received from her,' he said. ''I'm most excited about meeting William Hurt, I like him.' I wrote back . and said, 'I like him too.'  And then we lost connection. Ironically, I . wrote back a short text, and said, 'Lost you.' That was at 7:57 p.m. Of . course, I meant that I had lost reception with her, not, you know, that I . had lost my daughter.' Excitement: Sarah was most looking forward to meeting actor William Hurt . He also revealed that director Randy Miller called him to personally inform him of the accident shortly after the couple had already been informed by a coroner. 'The calls were close together,' Richard said. 'Randy Miller was shaken, very, very . upset. He apologized many times. I don't really know myself what part . Randy Miller played in this. But he was very upset that day. He was . saying he was so sorry. ' Richard said he remembered his daughter as a 'wonderful person, she was driven to do a lot of . things, energetic. We loved her very much.' In harm's way: Sarah's mother Elizabeth worried her daughter might have tried to save equipment without thinking about the danger she was in . Mother Elizabeth believed Sarah may have believed she had an obligation to rescue the film equipment as the train came down. 'She may well have . had that in mind, not realizing the immediate danger,' Elizabeth said. 'Whatever comes . from this, it has to be something positive, so that her life will not be . wasted in vain. All the energy and devotion and love that she had, it . can't be in vain.' At the time of the accident, the crew was shooting a dream sequence. But Sarah's family now calls it a nightmare. 'This is not all about Sarah; it addresses a much, . much bigger problem,' Elizabeth said. 'The value of a dollar cannot be put on Sarah's . life, the way that directors and producers put a dollar value on a . movie. Everything she did was in a big way and this is a testament to . her love of the camera and making a difference after everything is said . and done.' This Sunday several nominees at the Academy Awards wore black ribbons to remember Sarah, who's name and photograph were also projected onto a bumper during the ceremony. Winning director of 'The Lady in Number 6: Music Saved My Life' Malcolm Clarke, 'Gravity' film editor Mark Sanger, and 'Gravity' sound editor Glenn Fremantle all wore ribbons in Jones' memory during their acceptance speeches. At the end of Bette Midler's performance, a bumper with Jones' name was shown to commemorate her and audience members were directed to Oscar.com for a photo gallery of the late camera assistant, reports Indiewire.com . Sarah Jones was only 27 when she died on the set of 'Midnight Rider' during pre-production in Georgia . A bumper with Sarah's name was projected during the ceremony after Bette Midler's performance . Jones died on February 20 when she was struck by a freight train on a train trestle over the Altamaha River near the Doctortown Road crossing in Wayne County, Georgia. Seven other crew members were also injured. Earlier on Sunday, around 700 mourners gathered at Atlanta Botanical Garden's Mershon Hall to remember the talented young crew member. In attendance were family, friends, and one other crew member who was injured during the accident. The Hollywood Reporter writes that the memorial took place just hours before the Academy Awards where a large number of Jones' supporters petitioned the Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences to mention the young woman in the Oscar's 'In Memorium' segment. An online petition collected 62,000 signatures and a facebook and twitter campaign urged attendees to wear the black ribbon in Sarah's memory. Celebrities like Allison Janney and Anna Faris began instagramming and tweeting photos under the hashtag #SlatesForSarah on another facebook page. Though Jones' photograph was not . shown along Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Peter O'Toole, James Gandolfini, . Shirley Temple, Harold Ramis, and Paul Walker who Hollywood lost earlier . this year, she was still commemorated publicly during the ceremony and . her friends and family are thankful. The . Slates for Sarah facebook page wrote following the ceremony: 'Everyone . said it was impossible but the love of Sarah and 'Sarah's Team"" did it!! The Academy saw your slates and heard your voice and Sarah Elizabeth . Jones made it to the Oscars as a symbol of a better, safer film world to . work in for all the young people coming into the business….We go . further working together for change.' The . Hollywood Reporter writes that during Jones' memorial, Union leader . Bruce Doering announcd that the International Alliance of Theatrical . Stage Employees (IATSE) would rename its annual scholorship the Sarah . Elizabeth Jones Scholorship. The scholorship will be given to the child . of union members interested in following in their parent's footsteps. Stars like Anna Faris and Allison Janney showed their support on #SlatesForSarah . Sarah Jones' supporters rallied to get her commemorated during the ceremony and they succeeded . Doering also spoke of the union's important role in preventing accidents like the one that killed Jones. 'Since this terrible accident happened, we're trying to figure out how this happened and we're committed to taking the issue of unsafe conditions as far as we can take it -- and like Sarah -- full-on,' Doering said. Questions have been raised on whether or not the film had permission to film near the tracks and an investigation is underway. Investigators with the Wayne County . Sheriff's Office have released few details surrounding the deadly . collision about 60 miles southwest of Savannah. Joe Gardner, the lead . detective on the case, has said the crew had permission to film next to . the train tracks on property owned by Rayonier, the forest products . company that has a large paper mill nearby. The tracks belong to CSX . Railroad. 'CSX has told me . they were aware they were out there, but they did not have permission to . be on the train tracks,' Gardner told reporters last week. The sheriff's initial incident report . said Jones was on the railroad bridge spanning the river when she was . struck by a passing freight train. Others were 'injured either by the . train or by debris from production equipment or by a bed that had been . placed on the trestle by the crew,' the report said. Filmmakers have shelved production on the movie.","Documentary director Malcom Clarke and 'Gravity' editors Mark Sanger and Glenn Fremantle all wore a black ribbon during their acceptance speeches .

The principal of a high school in Dickinson, North Dakota, has been arrested and charged with deliberately setting it ablaze. Trinity High School caught fire in the early hours of Monday morning and so much damage was caused that classes have had to be moved elsewhere for the rest of the school year. Thomas Sander, 30, was charged on Tuesday with arson and endangerment by fire, both Class B felonies. Both felonies carry a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison. Thomas Sander, the principal of Trinity High School, has been charged with arson and endangerment by fire and is facing prison time . Hired as principal last July, Sander is being kept in custody at the South West Multi-County Correctional Facility, according to the Dickinson Police Department. Students have been given the week off while officials decide how to proceed for the rest of the school year, reports the Bismarck Tribute. Trinity’s 253 students in grades 7-12 are expected to resume classes on Monday in a combination of facilities belonging to Dickinson Public Schools and Dickinson State University. TMI, a laminate manufacturer in Dickinson, has also offered space for administration offices. ‘The outpouring of support from the community and the state has been phenomenal,’ said Dickinson Catholic Schools President Steve Glasser. ‘Our No. 1 priority right now is to teach our kids.’ Trinity High School caught fire in the early hours of Monday morning and so much damage was caused that classes have had to be moved elsewhere for the rest of the school year . Four fire trucks, three utility vehicles and 29 firefighters battled the fire from 1:15 am on Monday for two hours until they had it under control. The front office of the school, which opened in 1961, had the most fire damage, with structural damage in the library above the office. The rest of the school suffered significant smoke damage. Glasser said that officials don’t even know if they will be able to be in the building for next year. ‘We want as best we can that in a few weeks there’s some sense of normalcy for our faculty and students,’ Glasser said.","Trinity High School caught fire in the .

The king of the Maoris has vented his anger over a diplomatic row that saw him pull out of a meeting with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. King Tuheitia said he was ‘not some carnival act to be rolled out at the beck and call of anyone’ after officials offered him  a supposedly paltry 90-minute meeting with the royal couple during their visit to New Zealand next month. The king blamed ‘faceless bureaucrats’ for ‘a grave error of judgment’, and said the full reasons for his refusal were ‘conveyed to the royal couple in a personal letter . . . several weeks ago’. Offended: King Tuheitia of the Maoris (left) objected to only being given a 90-minute slot during the planned visit to New Zealand of the Duke and Duchess (right) of Cambridge next month. He has sent the Royal pair a letter . The furore risks overshadowing William and Kate’s tour of the country, which begins in Wellington on April 7. Not only was the meeting considered to be hugely important as a mark of respect to the indigenous community, but William and Kate would have been following in the footsteps of the Queen and Prince Philip, who visited King Tuheitia’s mother, Dame Te Atairangikaahu, in 1953. The Queen visited her again in 1995 and shortly . before she died in 2006 and was succeeded by her son, Prince Charles . wrote to the queen to congratulate her on the 40th anniversary of her . coronation, saying: ‘Our two families have enjoyed a wonderful . friendship. ‘The 40 years of . the leadership, courage and stability you have so far given to the . people of Aotearoa New Zealand and indeed to the wider world... is an . immeasurable treasure.’ The . Maori people had hoped that the Duke and Duchess would visit their . ruler at his home at Turangawaewae Marae - his people’s ‘sacred’ place - . during a visit to the country’s North Island. Historic ties: Prince William receives a hongi, a Maori greeting, from a tribal leader in 2011 during a visit in which he met grieving families of the victims of the Pike River Mine disaster on New Zealand's South Island . Locals had been . planning the couple’s itinerary for weeks, saying they were looking . forward to welcoming the young royals to the ‘heart of the kingitanga’, . the Maori monarchy. But on Tuesday the Mail revealed that King Tuheitia was so insulted by the suggestion the couple could offer only 90 minutes out of their schedule, he pulled out of the visit completely. According to sources, the long list of demands around the visit and . tight timeframe would have broken proper protocol on the marae. In a statement yesterday his office said: ‘The King was never asked anything, he was simply told. ‘The . government-appointed committee overseeing the visit never met with any . officials from this office and when we did seek to contact them, they . were not willing to be negotiable or flexible in their approaches to the . king. ‘A senior rangatira [official] noted that the king and the . kiingitanga [the royal line] are not some carnival act to be rolled out . at the beck and call of anyone, and nor should we be prepared to . compromise our tikanga [customs] to fit into a pre-determined schedule.’ History: The Royal couple would have followed in the footsteps of the Queen, who met the Maori king's mother Dame Te Atairangikaahu in 1953 and again in 1995, when she wore traditional dress (left) It added: ‘The king wanted to give his best to this couple to reflect their status, he was being prevented from doing that.’ New Zealand Prime Minister John Key described the king’s decision as ‘a shame’. He said the ‘generous’ slot offered was longer than most engagements the couple had in the country. A Kensington Palace spokesman also stressed there would be ‘numerous chances’ to meet members of the Maori community at the many traditional welcomes from different tribes the couple will receive. They said: ‘The programme for the visit, including the Maori elements, has been signed off by the New Zealand Government. ‘Many elements were considered and we have worked with the New Zealand Government to include several appropriate events on the visit to recognise the significant of Maori culture. 'These include a substantial Powhiri, or ceremonial welcome, in Wellington, together with Maori engagements in Dunedin, Christchurch and elsewhere.’ The Duke and Duchess - accompanied by their son, Prince George - will arrive in New Zealand on April 7 and visit Wellington, Blenheim, Auckland, Hamilton, Cambridge, Dunedin, Queenstown and Christchurch before leaving for Australia on April 16.","King Tuheitia offered 90-minute meeting in New Zealand visit next month .

The lime green 458 Spider, which has a top speed of 200MPH and is capable of 0-60mph in just over three seconds, was spotted trapped in the sand at Watergate Bay, near Newquay yesterday. Although there were concerns the vehicle had been driven onto the beach by a reckless owner, it later emerged that it was in fact being used in a fashion shoot for Official Ferrari Magazine - although it still required a tractor and trailer to pull it out the sand. Stuck: Ferrari confirmed that a 458 Spider became trapped on Watergate Bay, but said it had been driven there as part of a fashion shoot for Official Ferrari Magazine. It added that the car was towed to safety by a tractor . The lime green 458 Spider, which has a top speed of 200MPH and is capable of 0-60mph in just over three seconds, was spotted in the sand at Watergate Bay, near Newquay . The vehicle had been loaned to the magazine by the Carrs Ferrari dealership in Exeter and the plan was for it to take centre stage in a fashion shoot that will appear in a forthcoming issue. Shortly after the vehicle was unloaded, however, its wheels became embedded in grooves in the sand that had been left by a tractor that delivered it onto the beach. Ferrari confirmed that the incident had taken place, but said at no point was the vehicle at risk of being swept out to sea. In a statement, a spokesman said: 'We can confirm that the Ferrari 458 Spider pictured on the beach at Watergate Bay on Wednesday.' Trapped: Shortly after the Ferrari 458 Spider was unloaded, its wheels became embedded in grooves in the sand that had been left by a tractor that delivered it onto the beach .

Permission: Watergate Bay (pictured) is a private beach owned by the Watergate Bay Hotel, who allowed Ferrari to use it for the photo shoot . 'Unfortunately, when the Ferrari 458 Spider was off-loaded from the trailer, the rear wheels bedded-down into the ruts created by the tractor, giving the impression that the car had beached itself,' he added. Watergate Bay is a private beach owned by the Watergate Bay Hotel, who gave Ferrari permission to run the photo shoot.

The Ferrari 458 Spider boasts a 4.5-litre V8 engine, an F1 dual clutch 7-speed transmission and an aluminium roof that can be retracted in 14 seconds. The on-the-road price is £198,936 and is believed to be the first car ever to combine a mid-rear engine with a convertible roof. Ferrari claims this is a key innovation that guarantees in-car comfort far superior to a traditional softtop, adding it has an 'extraordinarily fast deployment and retraction time and is far lighter and simpler than any package of its kind.","The £200,000 Ferrari 458 Spider became stuck in sand on a Cornwall beach .

Justice: Barry Minkow, a former millionaire and convicted con artist pictured here in 2002, pleaded guilty to cheating his San Diego church congregation out of some $3million . Barry Minkow has been a teenage millionaire, a convicted con artist, a fraud investigator and a religious leader - and now he can add 'church thief' to his list of vocations. On Wednesday, Minkow, 46, pleaded guilty to embezzling funds from the San Diego Community Bible Church over the course of nearly 10 years, a U.S. attorney's statement said. He was already serving a five-year sentence for a securities fraud conviction in Florida and could get five additional years when he is sentenced for the new conviction April 7. Under the plea deal, Minkow admitted that he opened unauthorized church bank accounts, forged signatures on checks and pocketed member donations for himself. 'Barry Minkow is again convicted of fraud, this time for stealing money from the parishioners of San Diego Community Bible Church,"" U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy said. 'We stand vigilant against those who cheat and steal without regard to the consequences wrought on their victims and their communities.' Minkow gained national attention as a teenager in the 1980s by founding the ZZZZ Best carpet cleaning company in Southern California at age 16. Church thief: Minkow admitted that as a pastor of the San Diego Community Bible Church, he opened unauthorized church bank accounts, forged signatures on checks and pocketed member donations . Wall Street prodigy: Minkow, pictured in 1996, rose to prominence in the 80s when, as a 16 year old, he founded a successful carper-cleaning business and became the youngest person in U.S. history to take it public four years later . By the time he was 21 years old, Minkow became the youngest person at the time in U.S. history to take a company public, and he became very wealthy on paper. The business prodigy was living the high life for a while, buying luxury sports cars and sending money to Israel as the stock of his company soared. But ZZZZ Best turned out to be involved in a Ponzi scheme in which investors poured $100million into bogus fire and water restoration projects. In 1988, Minkow was sentenced to 25 years in prison for cheating investors out of $26million by convincing them that his company was making $43million a year, 10News reported. Changed man: Minkow was convicted in 1988 of cheating investors out of $26million and sentenced to 25 years, but was released only seven years later, leaving the prison a born-again Christian . The incredible tale of Minkow's meteoric rise and fall was told in a 1990 biography by Daniel Akst titled 'Wonderboy: The Kid Who Swindled Wall Street.' He was released in 1995 on parole, emerging from prison gates as a born-again Christian and evangelist after undergoing a religious conversion. Minkow became pastor of the San Diego church two years later. He also founded the Fraud Discovery Institute, which helped the FBI and other law enforcement agencies ferret out white-collar crimes around the country. Minkow’s transformation from a convicted criminal to an anti-fraud crusader and church leader earned him much praise in the media, and his life story was even featured on an episode of CBS’ ‘60 Minutes’ in 2006. Fraud fighter: Minkow founded the Fraud Discovery Institute targeting white-collar criminals - but he was manipulating the stock prices of the companies he was investigating . But even while working with the institute, he was engaged in manipulating the stock prices of the companies he was investigating, federal prosecutors said. In 2011 in Miami, a federal judge sentenced Minkow to five years in prison for involvement in a scam that cost homebuilder Lennar Corp. some $580million in lost stock value. The judge, Patricia Seitz, said at the time that Minkow was a 'very gifted person,' but he had ""no moral compass that says ""stop.""'","Barry Minkow gained notoriety in the 1980s when he founded a California carpet-cleaning business ZZZZ Best at age 16 .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 12:46 EST, 5 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 16:03 EST, 5 March 2014 . Under pressure from gun control advocates, Facebook agreed Wednesday to delete posts from users selling illegal guns or offering weapons for sale without background checks. A similar policy will be applied to Instagram, the company's photo-sharing network, Facebook said. The measures will be put into effect over the next few weeks and will apply worldwide at Facebook, which claims 1.3 billion active users. 'We will remove reported posts that explicitly indicate a specific attempt to evade or help others evade the law,' the company said in a statement. Worrisome trend? In response to outcries from gun control advocates, Facebook says it will ban all posts and accounts that somehow facilitate or advocate illegal gun sales on the social media site . New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has been asking Facebook to adopt such restrictions, as have Mayors Against Illegal Guns, the group backed by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and Moms Demand Action. Moms Demand Action collected more than 230,000 signatures on petitions calling on Facebook to act. 'Responsible social media sites know that it is in no one's interest for their sites to become the 21st-century black market in dangerous and illegal goods that place our families and communities at risk,' Schneiderman said. 'I congratulate Facebook and Instagram for taking these simple, common-sense steps to protect the safety and security of their users, and encourage other social media sites to follow their lead.' Tom King, president of the New York affiliate of the National Rifle Association, acknowledged that Facebook is allowed to set its own rules but said he regards the new restrictions as 'a kind of limit on our First Amendment rights.' Although his group, the New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, doesn't sell guns, he wondered whether it could be blocked if somebody reported the organization's Facebook page. As for legal sales...: There's no way to know how many guns are sold via Facebook, because the transactions are actually completed offline. The rules also include new age limits for posts promoting sales of restricted items like firearms . 'This is something that could greatly get out of control very quickly,' King said. New York has some of the nation's toughest gun laws. It requires a background check for private gun sales and prohibits sales of some popular firearms, such as the AR-15 rifle. Under the new policy, Facebook would allow a user in Texas to list an AR-15 for sale, since the gun is legal there, as long as it wasn't offered for sale in states where the weapon is illegal. But the company would delete a similar post from someone in New York. Outcry: In an online petition, Moms Demand Action warned that Facebook and Instagram could also be used to sell guns to convicted felons, domestic abusers or others barred under federal law from obtaining a firearm . It would also remove posts from any state in which a gun seller says a background check will be skipped, even if such checks aren't required where the seller lives. 'This is one of many areas where we face a difficult challenge balancing individuals' desire to express themselves on our services and recognizing that this speech may have consequences elsewhere,' Facebook said. The company already has systems in place to remove advertising that is false and deceptive, and it prohibits ads for illegal drugs, tobacco products and prescription drugs. There's no way to know how many guns are sold via Facebook, because the transactions are actually completed offline, said John Feinblatt, chairman of Mayors Against Illegal Guns. But such sales have occurred. In Kentucky, for example, federal authorities in February charged an Ohio man with illegally selling a 9 mm pistol to a Kentucky teenager in a transaction arranged through Facebook. In an online petition, Moms Demand Action warned that Facebook and Instagram could also be used to sell guns to convicted felons, domestic abusers or others barred under federal law from obtaining a firearm. That list also includes people judged mentally defective. Feinblatt said Google Plus and Craigslist already prohibit all gun sales, legal or illegal. But he said there are 'virtual gun shows' online. His group issued a report in December showing 66,000 active ads on a popular gun sales website called Armslist. The report said 16 states and the District of Columbia require background checks for private firearm purchases.","The social media giant made the move in response to pressure from gun control advocates decrying illicit gun sales that originate on Facebook .

Solved: Detectives investigating the 30-year-old cold case murder of Priscilla Strole have said they are satisfied that Robert Hathaway (left) was responsible for her death after DNA evidence matched him at the scene . A 48-year-old San Francisco area man identified last month through DNA evidence as the person who killed his childhood friend's mother 30-years ago left a suicide note admitting he 'was taking the cowards way out'. On February 15, Robert Hathaway hanged himself four days after police interviewed him for the August 31, 1983 murder of Priscilla Strole, who was found dead after suffering a violent beating and sexual assault in her own home. And as detectives announced they were satisfied the three-decade old cold case had been solved, the victim's brother said that he was disappointed Hathaway would not be facing execution for his crime. Priscilla Strole was found naked and dead on her floor in Fairfield by her own 15-year-old son Kyle Stracner after he returned from a night out with friends. At the time detectives found no sign of forced entry into the home, coming to the conclusion that Strole knew her killer. According to officers, Strole suffered a gruesome attack, was raped and robbed of her jewelry. 'She suffered numerous injuries to her face and head from kitchen knives, a can opener and a piece of decorative wood,' police said according to SFGate.Com. Scroll Down for Video . Murdered: Priscilla Strole was found dead on the floor of her San Francisco home by her 15-year-old son with gruesome wounds and having suffered a sexual assault . Thirty-years: A simple fingerprint search after 30-years helped to solve the murder of Priscilla Strole . 'All weapons used in the homicide were obtained from inside the house. The living room was in disarray and numerous items had been broken.' Investigators collected fingerprints and DNA in the form of semen from the scene but nothing matched in the database and no suspect was identified in the murder. However, in January, cold-case detectives reopened the file and ran the fingerprints through the  Automated Fingerprint Identification System. Hathaway had a clean record in 1983, but was arrested for burglary in 1986 and therefore in the meantime his prints had been uploaded into the system. Discovery: Priscilla Strole was discovered on the floor of 900 block of Buchanan Street in Fairfield . Relief and anger: Ron Whitted, Strole's brother said that he was annoyed that Hathaway had killed himself as he would have liked to have seen him face execution . Detectives obtained a search warrant to take DNA from Hathaway and his house and on February 11 they interviewed him about Strole's death. At the time, Hathaway denied murdering the mother of his childhood friend. However, four days later Hathaway took his own life and left a short suicide note that read he 'was taking the cowards way out'. Subsequently, on February 20, the DNA evidence collected matched the semen found 30 years before at the crime scene and detectives decided to close the case. Strole's brother, Ron Whitted, said that after 30-years of not knowing who killed his sister he would have liked Hathaway to have been executed, 'after spending some time behind bars'.","Priscilla Strole was discovered dead on the floor of her home by her 15-year-old son, Kyle Stracner 30-years ago .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 13:35 EST, 5 March 2014 . A con-artist psychic who scammed her clients out of millions of dollars was jailed for ten years on Monday. Rosa Marks, 62, was sentenced at a court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida after bilking $17.8million from customers in Florida and New York City. Prosecutors had sought 22 years. Among . Marks' victims was multimillionaire romance novelist Jude Deveraux who . testified at the trial in September after being defrauded out of . $12million over two decades. Self-proclaimed psychic Rose Marks pictured leaving court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida last August. She was jailed on Monday for ten years for stealing close to $18million from clients . Ms . Deveraux first sought the help of Marks in the 1990s following the . death of her eight-year-old son in a motorcycle accident and in the . midst of a painful divorce. Marks told the author that she could connect her with her dead son via a 'soul-swapping' treatment and led Ms Deveraux to believe that Brad Pitt was in love with her. Marks also stole clients' jewellery saying to had to rid it of curses while telling others she could protect them from the IRS. During sentencing on Monday, the judge told the Palm Beach Post: 'These people for whatever reason wanted to believe these crazy stories. 'I'm certainly not a psychologist and I can't figure out how any rational human being would believe any of the representations made by Mrs. Marks.' Marks, who called her victims 'dear friends' said that she didn't realize that she had done anything wrong. Scammed: Multimillionaire author Jude Deveraux testified in Florida last September that a clairvoyant she trusted stole millions from her . Ms Deveraux told the court last year that at the time she met Marks, whom she knew as Joyce Michaels, she was suicidal and trying to get out of a 'horrible, terrible' marriage, according to the Sun-Sentinel. Ms Deveraux told the court that she did not believe in psychic powers but was really looking for someone to listen to her problems. She met Marks for the first time in a studio in midtown Manhattan where the psychic claimed to work from a 'special room' in St Patrick's Cathedral on 5th Avenue. After several meetings, Marks told the writer that she would help her achieve a 'peaceful divorce' - for a fee of $1,200. Although the author did not believe in Marks' psychic powers, she came to trust her after several of her prophecies appeared to come true. Marks managed to accurately predict that Ms Deveraux's husband would file for divorce - down to the hour that he would do so. The clairvoyant also told the author to leave her apartment for a few days and change her locks because her estranged husband would show up. Ms Deveraux told the Florida court that this turned out to be the case and 'staff at her apartment building told her that her husband unexpectedly showed up and was angrier than anyone they'd ever seen'. Marks later asked the author to hand over $1million which she would need to carry out her meditations - but that it would be returned to her. The psychic told Ms Deveraux that the money would be kept in drawers in the cathedral room of St Patrick's. The author was told that 'money was evil' by the psychic and would attract evil if kept in her bank account. Swindle: One of the Florida storefronts allegedly used by the psychic fraudsters - they also had locations in Manhattan . Most of the money that Marks was found guilty of stealing is believed to have come from Ms Deveraux who amassed the vast fortune by selling 60 millions copies of her romance tales, which have titles such as Moonlight In The Morning, The Scent Of Jasmine and Scarlet Nights. Police swooped on Marks and a gang of psychics, all related by blood or marriage, in August 2011 after a huge cross-state investigation dubbed 'Operation Crystal Ball'. More than 400 rings, 100 watches and 200 necklaces – many of them from Cartier, Tiffany & Co and Gucci – were seized. They all billed themselves as fortune tellers, clairvoyants and spiritual advisers and operated from shops in Fort Lauderdale. The authorities said that many customers came to them as a desperate last resort, for instance hoping that they could be cured of a disease or put in touch with a deceased loved one. Customers were promised that their money would be returned once it was cleansed of evil spirits, but according to the indictment it was kept for personal used by the fortune tellers. Victims included a woman with a brain tumour who was told she would receive 'positive energy'. She was reportedly left  unemployed and in danger of losing her apartment. A person in Japan handed over $496,000 to the psychic readers and a man from Denmark sent about $186,000.","Rosa Marks, 62, was sentenced at a court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida after stealing millions from clients .

Sandi Kennedy, who lived in the town of Kennebunk, first became ill with a cough and vertigo in November. Her health deteriorated rapidly and doctors struggled to find what was wrong with her, despite a barrage of tests for neurological conditions and cancer. By Christmas Eve, the 38-year-old nurse - mother to Tucker, nine, twin boys Asher and Gunner, five and a daughter, Skyler, two - was admitted to hospital with symptoms similar to that of a stroke patient. Loss: Sandra Kennedy with her boys Tucker, Asher and Gunner. She died of the rare disease CJD on Monday . Happy day: Her husband, Jake Kennedy, said he knew she was the one he would marry when he first saw her . The 38-year-old nurse with Tucker, nine, twin boys Asher and Gunner, five and daughter, Skyler, two . Last month she was diagnosed with CJD, a rare and aggressive disease that attacks the brain and has no cure. It affects just one in a million people in the U.S. She died Monday. Her husband, Jake Kennedy, said she was a a strong, compassionate and giving woman and always put others before herself. He told the Portland Press Herald: 'She worked nights at the hospital so she could stay up the next day to take care of the kids. Support: The community rallied around the mother-of-four, pictured here with her husband, after she was diagnosed . She was was described as an active, vibrant woman who loved taking her children on trips . 'She always did above and beyond to be her best for her children.' Mr . Kennedy also spoke of the day they met at his father’s funeral. She was . there to support her friend, who married his older brother. 'I looked in her eyes and just knew,' he added. 'She was so beautiful.' Kennebunk resident Sarah Nunan has known Mrs Kennedy since 2007 and told the Bangor Daily News their children have grown up together. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare and fatal condition that affects the brain. Symptoms include memory loss, change of personality, abnormal jerking movements and blindness. The incubation period can last years before initial symptoms surface, but most sufferers will die within around four months of when they do emerge. The exact origin of CJD is not clear, but it appears to be caused by an abnormal protein called a prion which causes irreversible damage to nerve cells. One form of the disease, known as variant CJD, is thought to be caused by consuming meat from cows infected with BSE - also known as 'mad cow disease'. There is currently no cure. She said: 'She is the strongest person I know, greatest mother, wife and daughter. She always has a smile on her face and laughter in her voice. 'Now is my time to be the rock to her kids, husband and her wonderful family. I love them with all my heart and always will.' After Mrs Kennedy was diagnosed, the family received an overwhelming amount of support. Local businesses held fundraisers and a page on fundraising web site www.youcaring.com raised almost $80,000 to help the family pay medical expenses. A statement on the page posted yesterday said: 'Our hearts are very heavy, but with the love and support from all of you, we find strength through our tears. 'Sandi has passed away and although our sorrow is overwhelming for a life taken too soon, we find comfort knowing she will live on through those she loved so dearly. 'Your continued prayers, support and love for the Kennedy and Tucker family has been truly heartwarming and amazing.' In September health officials confirmed that a patient at a New Hampshire hospital earlier this year died from Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease. On May 28, 2002, the United States Food and Drug Administration banned anyone having spent at least six months in certain European countries (or three months in the United Kingdom) from 1980 to 1996 from giving blood. This was later relaxed to a cumulative total of five years or more of civilian travel in European countries. However, the three-month restriction on travel to the UK - the epicentre of fears over CJD - has not been changed. In November a U.S ban on beef imported from the EU was lifted after 15 years. America imposed a blanket ban on EU beef imports in the 1990s but the Department for Agriculture has published new regualtions in line with recommendations from the World Organisation for Animal Health.","Sandi Kennedy, 38, first became ill in November with a cough and vertigo .

The bizarre story of Adam Muema, the NFL prospect who mysteriously went missing last month and spent three days at a Florida airport, has taken a turn for the even more outlandish after a shadowy figure claiming to be the second coming of Jesus Christ tweeted that the player’s actions had been ‘foretold by Torah Code prophecy.’ Muema, 21, left the NFL Scouting Combine in Florida before running any drills because, he said, God told him to in order to fulfill his dream to play for the Seattle Seahawks. In an attempt this week to explain his peculiar behavior, the player has revealed that he communicates with God via numbers and believes that the self-anointed Lord RayEl is God. Scroll down for video . Muema has spent the past couple of days tweeting and positing about his devotion to RayEl, who he calls God . It was RayEl who on Saturday tweeted that Muema’s decision was foretold and included a link to a YouTube video which supposedly explain the so-called prophecy. The polar vortex is another recent event which Ray-El claims was foretold.

'Suit up and lace ya boots up its war time. R-A-Y E-L Tha Mes-siah. Confirmed by the Holy Spirit, so there's no science. Coming straight from the dome no trying & I know He the Truth, no lying.’ Born Raymond Elwood, RayEl declared himself the Messiah three years ago. He communicates with his followers through YouTube videos and a website where he asks his followers for donations. Until recently Muema was considered . an exciting NFL prospect after becoming the fourth leading . rusher in San Diego State University history. He was initially expected to be a mid- to late-round draft pick, but his stock has plummeted following his bizarre explanation for the combine no-show. On . Saturday Muema posted a rambling and incoherent explanation of his non-appearance and revealed that he had gone to church instead. Over the last couple of days, Muema has tweeted and posted messages on Facebook and Instagram about Lord RayEl , who he refers to as God . Muema, 21, left the NFL Scouting Combine in Florida before running any drills because, he said, God told him he would fulfill his dream to play for the Seattle Seahawks if he did so . ‘Okay here’s is the Seahawks #8 story. I was given #8 the first time playing football started to love this number. I was wondering if I could be 8 in the NFL & he said go to the store to decorate your living space. 'Went to the Christian store lady says when did that get in & didn’t let her grab it & said it was for me. Later, I ditch the combine to go to the saturday service & speaker was GM for Seahawks. I was honored by the Rev for being the 1st out of 8 yrs to go to this service, I cried :) 'If I would of performed that day I would of missed that meaningful #8. Glory be to God.

Police shot dead four of the attackers and captured the other four. Panic: Police are urgently questioning all Uighur Muslims in Kunming after the attack that left 143 injured . CCTV shows there to have been 10 masked attackers randomly knifing bystanders in Kunming station . Distressing photos circulating online . showed bodies, pools of blood and abandoned luggage scattered across the . terminal floor in the wake of what authorities termed an 'organised, . premeditated, violent terrorist attack'. Qin . Guangrong, Communist Party chief of Yunnan province where Kunming is . located, said the eight attackers had 'originally wanted to participate . in jihad'. 'They could not . leave from Yunnan, so they looked elsewhere, and went to Guangdong . province, but also could not leave, so they returned to Yunnan,' Qin was . quoted as saying by the state-controlled Xinhua news agency.

Black bears living in Yosemite National Park in California are shunning human food and returning to their natural diets, research has found. Unlike Yogi Bear, the cartoon character famously known for his fondness for 'pic-a-nic baskets', the black bears are turning away from raiding visitor’s supplies and going back to a natural diet, after years of dangerously high consumption of processed foods. After implementing strict rules and tough fines on storing food in the park, the percentage of human foods in Yosemite bears’ diets has gone down from a 35 per cent high in the 1980s to just 13 per cent. Bears for berries: After park management implemented restrictions on bears' access to human foods, the Yosemite black bears have gone back to a natural diet . By analysing hair and bone samples from bears living in the park, researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, were able to estimate how much of the Yosemite bears’ diet was food sourced from humans. The percentage of human food in the bears' diet increased proportionally to visitors’ numbers until the late 90s, when a new strategy was implemented to reduce their access. Management found that human foods led to aggressive and problematic behaviour among the bears and began to work on strategies to restrict the bears’ exposure to it. The research found that the proportion of human foods in the bears’ diets decreased by about 63 per cent after the new strategies was implemented in the late 90s. Bear-ly legal: After bears were given food to entertain visitors in the 1920s, they developed a taste for human treats and by the 1980s 35 per cent of their diet was 'non-natural' Since the new restrictions were put in place, the levels of human foods in the bears' diets is now at a 1915 level . ‘Yosemite has a rich history of bear management practices as a result of shifting goals over the years,’ Jack Hopkins, lead author of the paper and a research fellow at UC Santa Cruz, said in a statement. ‘What we found was that the diets of . bears changed dramatically after 1999, when the park got funding to . implement a proactive management strategy to keep human food off the . landscape.’ Unlike his real-life friends, Yogi Bear is hardly ready to give up on picnic baskets just yet . Mr Hopkins obtained bone and hair samples from bears killed from 1915 and onwards, including contemporary fur samples collected in Yosemite National Park. The average proportion of human food in bear diets for the period from 1915 to 1919 was 13 per cent, but this increased as management pandered to the visitors, making human food accessible to the bears so tourists could watch them feed. This got the bears used to human food, something which they taught their young and despite the last artificial feeding area closing in 1971, the bears were addicted. They managed to find their own ways to get their paws on the goods, and between 1975 and 1985, the percentage of human foods in their diets was 35 per cent. ‘The bears just went back to the camp grounds and hotels and continued to find human food,’ Hopkins said. In 1999, the new strategy, which includes using bear-resistant food-storage containers and establishing a ‘bear team’ to make sure visitors followed the rules on storing foods, was implemented and by 2001, the numbers were down to 13 per cent. ‘The remarkable thing is that the bears that eat human food are now back to the same level of dumpster diving as in 1915, despite the fact that there are now millions of visitors in Yosemite every year and presumably a lot more garbage,’ the study’s co-author Paul Koch, a professor of Earth sciences and dean of physical and biological sciences at UC Santa Cruz, said.","Bears in Yosemite National Park are returning to their natural diet .

A mother who searched high and low for her son's beloved lost dog was devastated to find that a rescue agency had taken in the animal... only to refuse to give her back. Instead of reuniting the pet and her owner, the agency said it was too late because they had already arranged an adoption to a 'better' home. Rosa Torres searched her Panorama City neighborhood, posted on Craigslist and started a Facebook page when Raffiki, her Rhodesian ridgeback puppy, went missing on February 13, the LA Times reports. After a week's search, a volunteer saw that Raffiki's image was up on a website for shelter Karma Rescue, listing her for adoption under the name Kami. Karma Rescue is 10 miles from Torres' home. Daniel Torres, 4, cries whenever he looks at pictures of Raffiki -- who was adopted by a new family under the name 'Kami' Rosa Torres, the dog's original owner, claimed her application to own her own dog back was rejected because she 'lives in a bad neighborhood' Torres told the paper that she has fought to get Raffiki back -- but was told by the shelter she could not do anything after another family paid a $300 'adoption contribution' and took her home on February 21. 'I'll do whatever it takes,' she said. 'She's not just an animal, she's a part of our family. My 4-year-old son [Daniel] cries whenever he looks at her picture. We just want her back.' Torres said she even applied on Karma Rescue's website to adopt her own dog back and called the shelter but did not receive a response. Raffiki, seen playing with Daniel, 4, is 'part of our family,' mother Rosa Torres says. 'We just want her back' Though Torres' application was reportedly rejected because Raffiki had not been microchipped or spayed, the dog was scheduled to do so three days before it went missing . When pressed by the paper, Karma Rescue said that Torres' application did not meet its qualifications for pet owners. As Torres' pet, the dog reportedly was not microchipped, spayed, or have ID tags. A lawyer for Karma Rescue, Susan . Willis, also told The Times that 'had [Rosa Torres] been a little more . diligent, we would have spoken with her.' The dog was scheduled to be spayed and microchipped on February 16, CBS Los Angeles reports. Torres believes she was not considered because she lives in a 'bad part of town.' The decision to place the dog with a new family has even caused a rift inside Karma Rescue. Jessica Gary, a volunteer with the shelter, reportedly resigned over the 'elitism' she saw. Torres' call to the shelter to get the dog back was placed over an hour before her new owners submitted an online application . Torres found this listing from nearby shelter Karma Rescue, showing a picture of her dog under the name 'Kami.' Karma Rescue is located 10 miles from Torres' residence . Today, Karma Rescue published a statement on its Facebook page, defending its decision to place the dog with a new family. The letter confirms that Torres contacted the shelter before the dog's adoption and that it did not check its voicemail messages before the adoption. 'On February 21 at 6:03 p.m., Karma received, and approved, an adoption application for Kami, and requested the applicant family have an in-person meet-and-greet with her,' it reads. 'That family met Kami at NKLA and took her home that day.' 'At 6:54 p.m. that evening, Karma Rescue received an e-mail containing a second application for Kami from ""Rosa Torres."" However, this application was not reviewed until after the adoption was complete. Karma received a voicemail at 4:57 p.m. from ""Rosa Torres"" in which she claimed to be the dog's owner. Karma had not been aware of this voicemail until after the adoption had taken place.' Karma Rescue published this statement regarding the dispute over the dog's ownership . Meanwhile, Torres is continuing to look for signatures for her online petition, asking for the new owners to return the dog . The shelter, however, says that Torres should have contacted them 'sooner.' 'At 9:00 a.m. on Saturday, February 22, Karma contacted ""Rosa Torres"" to let her know Kami had already been adopted. She was also informed that had she contacted the organization sooner, Karma would have been in a better position to reunite her with the dog.' The shelter also says that a woman named 'Lexi Quinn' has launched a social media assault against Karma Rescue. 'There have been inflammatory, misleading, outright false onling postings regarding Karma Rescue and and the events surrounding Kami's adoption,' it says. The shelter also says the $300 may be waived when new owners have 'limited resources.' Meanwhile, Torres has set up an online petition asking for the dog to be returned by its new owners.","Raffiki, a Rhodesian ridgeback puppy, went missing on February 13 .

A Florida judge has slapped Democratic congressman Alan Grayson with a restraining order after his estranged wife complained that he had battered her over the weekend and said she feared for her safety and the safety of their two smallest children. Lolita Grayson's sworn complaint says the congressman 'showed up, unannounced' as she was preparing to take the two young children to a play date and asked to speak with her inside their house. When she refused, according to a sheriff's office document, he 'deliberately and with force pushed [Lolita] very hard against the front door, causing [her] to fall to the ground as a result.' After telling her husband not to touch her, Lolita said, she pushed him in the face and struck him in the stomach with her knee 'in order to protect and defend herself,' then called 911. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Grayson, a liberal Democrat from the Orlando, Florida area is married to Lolita, of Filipino descent, and they have five children together . Rep. Grayson roughhoused with son Stone Grayson in 2010 while son Storm Grayson played, shortly after he lost his House seat -- which he regained two years later . Grayson's press secretary, Lauren . Doney was quick to deny the charge, which sheriff's paperwork said . sparked  a 'domestic-violence battery' investigation. The accusations 'are absolutely false, completely unfounded, and clearly designed to vilify and harm Congressman Grayson,' Doney said in a statement. 'Congressman Grayson firmly denies Ms. Grayson's frivolous accusations.' A member of Grayson's staff told the  Orlando Sentinel that he watched the exchange from 15 feet away, and denied that his boss assaulted anyone. 'Absolutely not,' said Juan Lopez, the congressman's director of constituent services. 'It's just unfortunate that this is happening and that she would say something like this.' Grayson's office piled on later in the day, saying that '[s]adly, it was Ms. Grayson who physically attacked the congressman as he attempted to visit with his children.' 'He did not respond to Ms. Grayson’s violent assault,' read a statement. Grayson caught flak from anti-Obamacare Republicans when he claimed during a House speech that the GOP wanted sick Americans to 'DIE QUICKLY' Grayson once compared tea party conservatives to the Ku Klux Klan, claiming that both were equal sources of hate and intolerance . But Lolita Grayson's petition added that while she spoke with the emergency operator, Rep. Grayson told her within earshot of their kids that she 'would receive nothing' in their divorce and would be left 'in the gutter.' She also alleges that 'from time to time' in the past, the congressman 'has battered [her] and the parties' minor children' in incidents that did not lead her to file for injunctions from the courts. The result, she claims, is that his 'history of violence' toward her has made her fear for her safety. The Sentinel reported that the congressman's wife filed for divorce two months ago, and that her attorneys filed photos showing 'large bruises to her left leg and left shoulder.' The Orange County Sheriff's Office declined to provide the photos to MailOnline. A hearing is scheduled on March 20. The injunction will remain in force at least until that date. Grayson is a Democratic lightning rod in the House of Representatives. In October his re-election campaign emailed a fundraising solicitation that compared the conservative tea party to the Ku Klux Klan. A burning cross took the place of the 'T' in 'Tea Party.' Grayson's campaign slogan, 'A Congressman With Guts,' may come back to haunt him in divorce proceedings if his wife's charges are substantiated . He later defended the mailing, citing 'overwhelming evidence that the tea party is the home of bigotry and discrimination in America today, just as the KKK was for an earlier generation.' In September 2009 Grayson combated Republicans' objections to the Affordable Care Act by slamming the GOP's proposed alternatives in fiery rhetoric on the House floor. 'If you get sick, America,' he said, 'the Republican health care plan is this: Die quickly.' Signs behind him during the short speech read, 'The Republican health care plan: Don't get sick. And if you do get sick ... DIE QUICKLY.' Tennessee Republican Rep. Jimmy Duncan broke with decorum on the spot to lay into Grayson, saying, 'That is about the most mean-spirited partisan statement that I've ever heard made on this floor, and I, for one, don't appreciate it.' Offering a passive-aggressive apology, Grayson later returned to the floor to say that '“I apologize to the dead and their families that we haven't voted sooner to end this holocaust in America.' Grayson has also used targeted websites to oppose military action in Syria and to shame Republicans with a lengthy list of Americans he claimed had died because they lacked health insurance. An aide to retired Army Lt. Col. Allen West, who defeated Grayson in a 2010 election before losing the seat back to him in 2012, declined comment. Col. West has been married for 25 years and has two teenage daughters with his wife Angela.","Democratic Rep.

What started out as an expose into the lives of neo-Nazis has turned into a documentary of how a California man was shot by his 10-year-old son. In the months leading up to his murder Jeff Hall, a leader of the National Socialist Movement, was being filmed by Julie Platner. But before the New York video journalist could complete her work, Hall had been killed by his own child, leaving many unanswered questions. Questions: Jeff Hall was being filmed for a documentary about neo-Nazism when he was killed by his 10-year-old son . After his untimely death, Platner began working with 60 Minutes, as they combined the rare footage she had of the Hall family with an investigation into his death. For more than a year Platner followed Hall and his family, building up trust to gain unprecedented access to the controversial organization he was part of. She had observed the group's meetings where members yelled Sieg Heil and read from Mein Kampf, watched the men fight with those who confronted them about their beliefs, and filmed as Hall cradled his baby daughter. 'I was really wanting to really confront . him for the first time and ask him what is he doing and why is he doing . this? But that never happened,' she told CBS News. Full access: Video journalist Julie Platner spent more than a year getting to know members of the group, so she could film their gatherings . Contrast: The rare footage shows Hall combining his dark beliefs with his fatherly role . Dedication: Platner worked hard to gain the trust of the Hall family so she could document the neo-Nazi movement . The video journalist had become a regular fixture in the family home which she said, were it not for obvious signs of Hall's dark beliefs, felt at times like any other house. 'They have a swastika hanging from their living room. I mean, you know, it doesn't get much darker than that,' she said, adding that Hall appeared to care deeply for his children. Family life regularly overlapped with . their neo-Nazi beliefs. Platner watched as group meetings took place in . the back yard, and took photos as a man in a T-shirt emblazoned with a . swastika cooked barbecue food during a baby shower. Rallies: The footage shows the neo-Nazi groups on marches and at meetings . Work-life balance: Platner showed how Hall fitted his neo-Nazi activities around his home life . Platner had been due to interview Hall on the day of his death. His son, Joseph, was convicted of second-degree murder last year and sentenced to ten years in juvenile prison. Joseph, who is now 13, claimed that he shot Hall because he didn't want to have to chose which parent to live with if his father divorced his stepmother, Time reported. A documentary about the killing, which includes Platner's footage, was broadcast on CBS on Sunday.","Video journalist spent more than a year with National Socialist Movement .

An attorney for a German couple who lost their bid for U.S. asylum in order to home-school their seven children says deportation proceedings against the family have been called off after the family was granted a special 'indefinite deferred status' by the Department of Homeland Security. The news comes only a day after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Uwe Romeike's asylum appeal. The family had initially been awarded asylum in the U.S. after they were threatened with incarceration and losing their children for their decision to home school. The decision to grant the family asylum was challenged by the Obama administration - a challenge the administration won. 'Indefinite deferred status': The Romeike family will be allowed to stay in the U.S. indefinitely thanks to a ruling from the Department of Homeland Security . Michael Donnelly, an attorney with the Home School Legal Defense Association, said the group received a call from the DHS on Tuesday morning. 'This is a great, great victory,' he said. 'We're all very grateful and pleased.' Romeike had claimed in court that his family faced persecution in Germany, where almost all children are required to attend state-approved schools. Those include some private Christian schools. The German government allows a few exceptions to the compulsory attendance law for parents who face logistical hurdles, for instance if they have to travel constantly for work. But children whose parents keep them home because of ideological objections to the state-approved schools are treated as truants. The Romeikes moved from Bissingen an der Teck, in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, to Morristown, Tenn., in 2008 after pulling their children out of school and facing an escalating series of confrontations with German officials that led to fines totaling 7,000 euros, or more than $9,000. They said they feared that if they continued to home-school in Germany they could be sent to jail or lose custody of their children. Home school: The family fought to stay in America after clashes with the German government over whether they could home-school their children . They initially were granted asylum by a Memphis immigration judge, but that decision was overturned on appeal when challenged by the Obama administration. As it worked its way through the courts, the family's case won the support of many in the Christian home-school community, and an online petition asking President Barack Obama to grant asylum for the family was signed by more than 127,000 people. Donnelly said on Tuesday that Romeike was declining interview requests, but he did issue a statement. It said the family — which includes Romeike, his wife and their seven children ages 1-17 — is 'happy' to have indefinite status, even if that means they won't get American citizenship any time soon. Illegal: The family fled to Tennessee a year and a half ago after facing fines for homeschooling their children in Germany . 'As long as we can live at peace here we are happy,' Romeike states. 'We have always been ready to go wherever the Lord would lead us.' Donnelly said the deferred status is revocable, but he doesn't expect it to be revoked as long as the family stays out of trouble. Donnelly said the news from Homeland Security was unexpected. The Romeikes' attorneys had been planning to ask friendly members of Congress to introduce a special bill allowing the family to stay. The Home School Legal Defense Association still is pursuing legislation that would recognize people who come to the U.S. to home-school their children with some sort of refugee or asylum status, Donnelly said. He said there are a handful of other German home-school families seeking asylum in the U.S. 'We don't know how the government will handle their cases,' he said. 'They are still in the early stages.' DHS: Homeland Security officials granted the family a special status that allows them to stay in the U.S. indefinitely . The case has garnered a lot of media attention. According to HSLDA, the Fox News website recorded more than one million views in 24 hours for the story about the Supreme Court's decision to not hear the case, which is the most page views the site has ever received for a single story in a 24-hour period. 'This is an incredible victory that I can only credit to Almighty God. I . also want to thank those who spoke up on this issue — including that . long ago White House petition. We believe that the public outcry made a . huge impact. What an amazing turnaround — in just 24 hours,' Michael . Farris, chairman of the Home School Legal Defense Association told the Christian Post. Romeike later said that the fight to stay in the U.S. was never about him. 'This has always been about our children. I wouldn't have minded staying . in Germany if the mistreatment targeted only me — but our whole family . was targeted when German authorities would not tolerate our decision to . teach our children — that is what brought us here,' Romeike said.","The Romeike family came to the U.S. 18 months ago after clashes with German government about whether they can home school their seven children .

A tenant in New York City is suing his landlord and business management after he returned home one evening to find all his belongings had been cleared from his apartment and tossed in the city dump by mistake. Nilay Sharoff, a 27-year-old consultant at Deloitte, initially feared that his prized possessions had been stolen when he returned home on October 9 to find everything - bar a TV and PS3 gaming system – gone. Initially Nilay though he had been robbed, but when the cops arrived they told him no robber would have stolen his bed, yet left a television and PlayStation. Nilay Sharoff, 27, shows an empty space in his apartment where he used to have a dresser until it - along with all his other possessions - got thrown out by mistake . Nilay Sharoff returned home to his apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side to find all his possessions had been removed and taken to the city dump . Next he asked the management company for 409 East 74th Street, a five-story rent controlled building on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, if they knew what had happened. An employee admitted to Nilay that a bumbling rubbish removal contractor had mistakenly cleared his $1,700-a-month apartment, 2D, instead of the neighboring unit 2B. ‘They were like, “Oh, it’s some 80-year-old contractor, he might be a little senile,” that’s what the landlord was saying. For me, it’s like, “I don’t give a damn. It’s still your fault.” ‘I mean, there’s dirty dishes in the sink. There’s a wet towel. Clearly someone’s living there,’ he told the New York Post. When Sharoff returned home to find everything - bar a TV and PS3 gaming system - gone, he initially thought that he had been robbed . The apartment was Sharoff's first home after graduating from college and moving out of his family's house in New Jersey . Shroff is suing the management company, Mautner-Glick, his landlord and the contractor for $40,000 after he was told that his stuff would be replaced, but he still has not been compensated. ‘Plaintiff lost… clothes, kitchen items, bed, dresser, sofa and other furniture, bathroom items, video games, personal identity information… credit cards… memorabilia, photographs and souvenirs,’ states the suit. ‘My passport was here, my Social Security card, credit cards, all my bank accounts,’ said the technology consultant, who travels frequently for work. He was also robbed of family photographs, including snaps of his mom, who passed away when he was 13 years old. Even the dirty dishes that Sharoff had left in his sink were thrown out . Baseball fan Shroff was distraught to find his prized Mariano Rivera bobblehead had been taken . ‘I was distraught,’ said Nilay, who was also forced him to take a week off work to rebuild his life. A die-hard baseball fan, Shroff was also bitterly disappointed to have lost a Mariano Rivera bobblehead, which currently sells for $400 on eBay.

One in every seven companies in the UK has been set up by migrant entrepreneurs, a new report revealed today. Nearly half a million people from 155 countries have settled in the UK and launched businesses. The Centre for Entrepreneurs think tank said the contribution of foreign-owned companies to Britain was ‘breath-taking’. The top 10 nationalities along account for more than 260,000 businesses in the UK . Overall, 14 per cent of jobs are created by companies founded by migrants to the UK. Researchers said the report, by Centre for Entrepreneurs and financial technology company DueDil, cast light on the positive impact migrants made on the UK's economy. DueDil founder Damian Kimmelman, himself an American serial ‘migrant entrepreneur’, said: ‘Immigration is one of Britain's most emotive topics for debate. Sadly, opinions are rarely informed by evidence. ‘This game-changing research proves that migrant entrepreneurs are hyper-productive, net contributors to the UK economy. ‘History tells us that the most productive states always encourage intellectual and technological ferment; that's what we're seeing in Britain right now, and we must celebrate it.’ While just 10.4 per cent of people born . in the UK start a business here, 17.2 per cent of migrants in Britain . have started their own company. They are also younger, the report found, with migrant entrepreneurs 44.3 years-old on average compared to 52.1 for those born in the UK. Centre for Entrepreneurs chairman and serial entrepreneur Luke Johnson . said: ‘The majority of the public appreciate the value of migrant entrepreneurs, yet our politicians and media send out negative signals that risk alienating this vital group of job creators. ‘Given the huge contribution of migrant entrepreneurs, we are calling upon the media and politicians to join us in celebrating those who come to our country and launch businesses.’ The report found the UK's migrant entrepreneurs are from almost every country, although there are significant representations from Ireland, India, the US, Germany and China, as well as African countries. There are almost 190,000 migrant entrepreneurs in London, 19,000 in Birmingham and 17,000 in Belfast . London benefits disproportionately, with 20 times the number of migrant-led businesses (188,000) than Birmingham, the second most popular location with 19,000. YouGov polling undertaken for the report . reveals that a significant proportion of the general public believe . migrant entrepreneurs make a positive contribution to the UK (44 per . cent) and a majority support the government's efforts to attract new . migrant entrepreneurs (50 per cent) compared with 28 per cent who . disagree. Centre for Entrepreneurs chairman Luke Johnson said migrant entrepreneurs make a 'huge contribution' This is despite the fact the public view immigration in a generally negative light and support a reduction in net immigration (68 per cent). Matt Smith, director of the Centre for Entrepreneurs, said: ‘The contribution of migrant entrepreneurs is, to be frank, breath-taking. ‘It is now the responsibility of politicians of all parties to celebrate migrant entrepreneurs' contributions and restate their commitment to maintaining pro-entrepreneurship immigration policies.’ The report comes a fortnight after Britain's most senior Roman Catholic cleric called on political leaders to ‘extinguish the discourse of fear’ that undermined the contribution of foreign entrepreneurs and workers moving to the UK. Speaking ahead of being created a cardinal last month, the Most Rev Vincent Nichols, the Archbishop of Westminster, said migrant workers helped ensure large cities such as London were able to ''carry on working’. He said: ‘I think we really should have a positive appreciation of the contribution that people who come to this country make to our well-being and economy. I think the idea that immigrants are a net drain on our economy is false. ‘We should not have a discourse about immigration which is based on fear.’","14% of companies in the UK were set up by people from abroad .

Yesterday the nation celebrated the second lunar month, when it is good luck to get a haircut. Also known as 'the day the dragon raises its head', it is widely believed you should have your own one refashioned in tribute. Fresh start: This little boy seems not to care that his haircut is a good luck token to mark the second lunar month . Tradition: Your maternal uncle will die if you cut your hair in February, they say, so the trim is celebratory . The day is referred to as Longitao, which means 'the dragon raises its head' so a haircut honours that move . But the tradition does not seem to have gone down well with this group of children. Whereas adults and barbers took to the streets with scissors and smiles, their sons and daughters can be seen screaming and crying as they go under the razor. Some entire families get a number one, much to the infants' distaste. Others, however, use the day as a chance for a restyled trim, demonstrated by one little tear-soaked boy getting a fresh bowl cut. Despite the traditions and folklore, these children in Hefei's Leijie Square cannot help but tear up . They join thousands of Chinese people who take to the streets for a trim before parades and markets . It is a large-scale operation, but the tradition is based on a misunderstanding of a fairytale, experts claim . According to folklore academics, the legend was about a man 'thinking of his uncle' who he used to give a haircut to in February. But in Chinese, that sounds very similar to the phrase 'dead uncle' The distraught toddlers seem unconcerned with the notion that this is a luxury - for if you shave in February, your maternal uncle will die. According to folklore experts, the superstition stems from a misunderstanding. In a well-known Chinese legend, a poor barber could not afford a decent new year's gift for his uncle, so he gave him a haircut. Many children have an entire shave to celebrate, whereas some have some more outlandish styles . Unusually, this little boy grinned amongst his screaming peers as he was given a whole new look . As he seems well aware, the haircut will be followed by dancing, singing and Chinese pancakes . As the fresh rainy season comes for farmers' crops, this is seen as a fresh start for people . This little boy looks frightened and unsure as he leans away from the razor-armed hairdresser . His uncle said it was the best gift he had ever had and wanted to make it a yearly tradition. After his uncle died, the barber cried every new year thinking of him. But 'thinking of his uncle' was mistaken for 'death of his uncle' because in Chinese their pronunciations are almost the same. Reaching the end, this little boy shows off his new fringe as the barber combs the back to finish . Parents are well aware what a hassle this day can be, so are on-hand to make it easier for the hairdresser . Only one of the group in Hefei's Leijie Square, in Anhui province, seemed content as he grinned and stuck his tongue out. But their tears will have doubtless been dried later with a trip to one of the thousands of parades. Families also celebrate the day with pancakes and dumplings.","China celebrated Er Yue Er, the start of the second lunar month, on March 2 .

Despite having reputations for wild parties, excessive drinking and allegedly hazing junior members, new research shows that members of Greek organizations on college campuses are more likely to graduate on time than their non-Greek counterparts. Additionally, the study found, membership in a sorority has no effect on a woman's GPA. However, the same can not be said for men in fraternities - according to the study, published in the Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Economics, finds that fraternity men have lower GPAs than those not in Greek life. The GPAs for men in fraternities, the study's authors - P. Wesley Routon of Middle Tennessee State University and Jay Walker of Niagara University - conclude, is 'only very slightly' lower than their non-Greek, male counterparts. 'Seven years of college down the drain!' Not quite - study finds Greek students are more likely to graduate in four years . 'Greek membership is found to increase the desire to pursue a graduate . degree, and increase the likelihood of graduating on time,' the authors write in the report. They add that 'four-year graduation rates are notably higher for Greek members, with male and female members being 4.8 and 4.7 percentage points more likely to do so, respectively (compared to non-members).' The study is based on a survey of more than 103,000 students at 463 colleges and universities across the U.S. Of the respondents, 19 percent reported that they were a member of a fraternity or sorority. The surveys were given to students in both their freshman and senior years. The researchers used the method that 'Greek members are only compared to very similar students who did not join a Greek organization.' Requirements: Members of Greek organizations have academic requirements, which may be why they are more likely to graduate on time . The study was first reported by Pacific Standard Magazine. The study also found that common stereotypes that students who are members of Greek organizations party like in the beer-guzzling buffoons in the classic film Animal House have some merit. 'Membership in a Greek organization is found to increase the . frequency of smoking cigarettes, drinking beer, drinking wine or . liquor, and hours per week partying during the senior year,' they write. The study finds that while there are only small increases in a student's likelihood to smoke cigarettes as members of a Greek organization, their likelihood to to drink more frequently than non-members increases significantly. More drinking, however, had little bearing on how students performed academically - which may be the result of academic requirements Greek organizations place on their members. Drink up: members of Greek organizations are morel likely to drink more frequently than non-Greek students . 'The increased likelihoods of graduating on time may stem from Greek . members having an added incentive to stay enrolled and keep a minimum . GPA, so that they can continue to belong to the organization,' the study finds. Additionally, members of both sororities and fraternities are more likely to be involved in student government than other students, and participate in volunteer activities more often than non-Greek students.","The study also finds that being in a Greek organization increases the amount of alcohol a student consumes .

Their lawyer, Henry Klingeman, read a statement on Teresa's behalf after they left the courtroom. 'Today, I took responsibility for a series of mistakes I made several years ago,' she said. 'I am heartbroken that this is affecting my family — especially my four young daughters, who mean more to me than anything in the world.' The plea deal comes after they pleaded not guilty last year to dozens of charges including bank fraud, wire fraud and bankruptcy fraud. They were accused of exaggerating income while applying for loans before their Bravo reality show debuted in 2009, then hiding their fortunes in a bankruptcy filing after the first season aired. They are also accused of submitting fraudulent mortgage and loan applications and fabricating tax returns and W-2 forms. Joe allegedly failed to file federal tax returns for several years beginning in 2004.

A selection of well thumbed magazines are strewn across a coffee table and in the corner, a young couple whisper nervously to each other. It could be a snapshot from any GP’s surgery in the land, but for one crucial difference: we all have needles hanging out of our arms, attached to bright yellow IV drips. Intravenous vitamin infusions – so-called ‘healthy’ cocktails pumped straight into the bloodstream to fight fatigue, boost energy levels and sharpen mental performance - are becoming big business. Earlier this week Rita Ora tweeted a photo of herself hooked up to an IV drip before filming her new music video . Rita posted snaps of her IV drip on her Instagram account . They’re the natural evolution of the vitamin injections that have been doing the rounds in the US since the 1960s, and are being fuelled by a growing celebrity fan base (Rita Ora posted photos of herself hooked up to a vitamin drip two days ago, while Cheryl Cole, Katy Perry and even Simon Cowell are all reputedly devotees). Now, specialist clinics offering the procedure - as either a direct injection or the more efficient IV drip - have started appearing across the UK as a quick health fix for the cash-rich, time-poor. Think about it: in a world where many of us consume most of our five a day from Pret containers, is it any wonder a treatment that offers a more direct route to better short-term health, glowing skin and boosted immunity is so sought after? Hooked-up health . It’s not a new trend in some parts of the world. In Japan, for instance, IV cafes offer entire menus of vitamin drips, from jabs that burn fat to those claiming to boost skin radiance. Women's Health reveal which jab solves what body issues in their April issue . In the US, the ‘Hangover Heaven’ bus has been circling Las Vegas for years, offering the burnt-out victims of Sin City an immediate intravenous pick-me-up. Just a few months ago, model Cara Delevingne tweeted a picture of herself hooked up to a vitamin drip to help her recover from a cold. One of the first to advertise the treatment in the UK was the London based Infusion Clinic, which has been administering vitamin drips from its Harley Street centre since the start of 2013. Founder Geeta Sidhu-Robb says more than 1,000 patients have already paid for the procedure, to the tune of £100 to £450 per hit. 'The majority of our clients are high achievers in their late thirties, and it’s evenly split between the sexes,' she says. 'Typically, it’s individuals who work very long hours and travel frequently - people who simply cannot afford to get ill.' Sidhu-Robb claims the four IV drips her clinic offers - ranging from immunity and vitality-boosting treatments to an anti ageing cocktail, all containing a blend of minerals such as magnesium, calcium and potassium and vitamins C and B12 - are '10,000 times' better than the benefits you glean from your standard five-a-day diet. 'The results are phenomenal,' she says. 'These infusions make you look younger as well as armour-plating your immune system. I haven’t been sick once since I started using them 12 months ago.' Too much of a good thing . The concept of vitamin IV treatments began in the US more than 50 years ago, when a Baltimore physician named John Myers invented the Myers’ Cocktail, containing a combination of vitamins B and C, as well as calcium and magnesium to treat a broad range of conditions from muscular strain to chronic fatigue. Over the past 12 months, the continual drip-drip of celebrity testimonials has been enough for the trend to soak into the public consciousness on this side of the Atlantic, too. A preventative solution that doesn’t involve spending hours at the gym or your entire life savings in Whole Foods? Sounds too good to be true. And perhaps it is. A number of British health experts have voiced doubts, claiming the drips are at best a serious waste of cash and at worst potentially harmful. Cara Delevingne posted an Instagram photo taken while on an IV drip with girlfriend Michelle Rodriguez back in January . 'When you eat food, your body breaks it down in your digestive system, taking what it needs and creating hormones such as insulin, glucagon and serotonin in the process,' explains Simon White, a senior technical adviser at multivitamin company Nature’s Best. 'Ingesting pure vitamins intravenously completely bypasses your body’s natural checks and measures.' NHS GP Dr Ranj Singh goes even further. 'People say you can’t have too much of a good thing, but of course you can,' he warns. 'A female acquaintance described it as 'feeling like Superwoman for three days afterwards. Another close male friend said he was ""swinging out of . bed feeling immediately awake""' 'Vitamins are medically active compounds and, as such, can become toxic in high enough doses. If people are feeling tired or run down, they should be looking for answers on a dinner plate, not in an IV.' The real deal? After 45 minutes in a leather chair attached to a vitamin drip, I can honestly say I feel no different. To be fair, Sidhu-Robb recommends at least three or four infusions before you can expect to see significant effects, but that would involve a four figure sum - a cash injection I’m less willing to stomach. Other celebs who have tried the trend include Rhianna (left) and Real House Wives of Atlanta star Kim zolciak Biermann (right) Perhaps my vitamins were already . balanced and my stress levels low - after all, I’d just returned from . holiday. And there is certainly anecdotal evidence of dramatic success. Read the full vitamins injection feature in the April issue of Women's Health . A female acquaintance described it as 'feeling like Superwoman' for three days afterwards. Another close male friend tried one during a particularly stressful period and said he was 'swinging out of bed feeling immediately awake' each morning for six days. Perhaps it’s the placebo effect, or perhaps both of them were significantly more run down or vitamin deficient than I was on that rainy Monday (according to The New York Times, as many as 30% of adults may be B12 deficient), but it’s certainly not a one-shot-suits-all treatment. Leaving the clinic, I chat briefly to a woman called Faith, a vitamin-IV-junkie who I guess is in her mid-thirties. 'The infusions are fantastic,' she enthuses. 'They make you look and feel so young and healthy.' Faith, it turns out, is 52. Suddenly, a few hundred pounds doesn’t look very expensive at all.

Bludgeoned to death with a claw hammer, the bodies of the couple were so badly disfigured police initially thought they had been repeatedly shot in the head. But the case remained cold until now, 31 years to the day, with Fisher's estranged wife, Theresa 'Terri' Supino, 53, charged with the double homicide. Police are said to have knocked down the door of Supino's home in the Des Moines suburb of Altoona and charged her with two counts of first-degree murder on March 3 - the anniversary of the killings.

Officials have refused to reveal the new break that lead to Supino's arrest, only saying that it came after hundreds of interviews and the continued process of evidence. According to WHOtv.com, a national TV show that investigates cold cases was taping in the town a few weeks ago. A reporter at the network also said she had recently moved out of her Altoona apartment and quit her job at the buffet restaurant Pizza Ranch. Supino and Fisher had two children together and were still married at the time of his death, however they had separated. Fisher had started stating Gregory, who he worked with at the at the Copper Dollar Ranch, a horse ranch about four miles northwest of Newton. On March 2, 1983, the pair had spent the night together at the ranch in a trailer Fisher had been living in. The next day a co-worker found their brutally-beaten bodies just before 8am. Fisher was found lying face down near the barn, wearing only blue jeans. Gregory was inside the trailer about 50 meters away. Terri Supino was married to 20-year-old Steven Fisher though they were separated.

The gruesome murders rocked the tiny town, however police said that while they had a suspect, there was not enough evidence to arrest them. An FBI profiler called in to help with the investigation called the case a 'crime of passion' that was 'up close and personal' and done by someone 'who was angry'. According to BethBardner.com, with all the time that has passed, many people, including family members of Melisa Gregory, had long ago decided Supino was innocent. Today Fox News reported that, in a written statement, Jasper County Sheriff John Halferty their investigation was still far from over and urged people with additional information to come forward. 'In the 31 years since the deaths of Steven and Melisa, the deputies, officers, agents, criminalists and many others have remained dedicated to assuring this case was never forgotten,' he said. Police: Jasper County Sheriff John Halferty said that, despite the charges, the investigation was not over . Halferty told the Newton Daily News he started looking into the cold case in 2003. He said he knew Gregory from junior high school and that her murder had always been in the back of his mind. He started 'digging into' the case when he was in a position to do so.

"Stephan . Schmidheiny, ex-owner of a Swiss construction firm, was sentenced to 16 years for his . role in the contamination of sites in Italy . By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 10:20 EST, 5 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 16:27 EST, 5 March 2014 . Victims of asbestos poisoning in Italy are urging Yale University to rescind an honorary degree given to a Swiss man later convicted of negligence in some 2,000 asbestos-related deaths. Stephan Schmidheiny, former owner of Swiss construction company Eternit, was convicted in 2012 by an Italian court and sentenced to 16 years for his role in the contamination of sites in northern Italy. An appeals court upheld the conviction for negligence in thousands of asbestos-related deaths blamed on contamination from the company and increased his sentence to 18 years. Billionaire Stephan Schmidheiny, pictured in 1996, has an honorary degree from Yale. He was convicted in 2012 of negligence for his part in 2,000 asbestos-related deaths in Italy . Another appeal is pending and Schmidheiny is not in custody. He has denied wrongdoing. Yale awarded Schmidheiny an honorary degree in 1996, citing him as 'one of the world's most environmentally conscious business leaders,' and praised his efforts to create sustainable development. Lawyer Christopher Meisenkothen, who represents the Asbestos Victims and Relatives Association, said what happened in Italy is the exact opposite of what Yale cited. 'It flies in the face of actual history. This is a matter of honor for the Italian victims,' Meisenkothen said. Yale said a decision to revoke an honorary degree must be by the Yale Corporation, the university's governing body. 'The decision to award the degree was made by a committee that considered his full record as a philanthropist who used his wealth to fund sustainable development in Latin America and elsewhere, and a path-breaking international advocate of change in the way businesses address environmental sustainability, as well as a businessman who inherited and dismantled a decades-old family asbestos processing concern,' the statement from Yale said. Relatives of employees who died related to asbestos react during the appeal court trial sentence against Swiss billionaire Stephen Schmidheiny on June 3 last year in Turin . Yale should at least appoint a faculty committee to review the matter and make a recommendation, Meisenkothen said. 'A lot of this information was not available to Yale at the time they awarded the degree,' Meisenkothen said. 'Yale is not our adversary. We just want to give them information they didn't have before, so they can do the right thing.' Some alumni and faculty, including 1992 graduate Christopher Sellers, have also urged Yale to revoke the honor. 'It shames me as a Yale graduate to think Yale isn't willing to look at what it did here,' said Sellers, now a history professor at Stony Brook University. 'For me, it's pretty clear that if Yale had known in 1996 everything we know today, it wouldn't have honored Schmidheiny with this degree.'","Stephan .

There are more super-rich people living in London than in any other city around the world, a report into the habits of the global elite reveals today. The report, from the estate agency Knight Frank, said around 4,200 people live in the capital who are defined as ‘ultra high net worth individuals’. To qualify, a person must have at least £18million in net assets, excluding the value of their main home, although it could include the value of their other homes. Hotspots: This map shows the top cities in the world for 'ultra high net worth individuals' On the up: Some parts of London have experienced explosive growth in popularity . A typical ‘ultra high net worth . individual’ has 2.4 homes, such as a home in a city and one in the . countryside, while many also have a home by the sea and a property in a . ski resort. Overall, . Knight Frank’s authoritative ‘Wealth Report’ says there are 4,224 . super-rich people in London, which significantly overshadows the . population in any other city. By comparison, Melbourne has 445, Oslo has 470, Milan has 235, Dublin has 365 and Berlin has 464. Tokyo, which comes second to London for the number of super-rich residents, has 3,525, followed by Singapore with 3,154. The . report predicts London will remain top of the premier league of . super-rich people over the next decade, with the numbers set to rise by . nearly 20 per cent over the next decade. By 2023, it expects the capital’s population of super-rich will be just short of 5,000 people. Top spot: London has been named the most desirable city in the world for the ultra-wealthy . In the shade: New York is lagging behind London as well as giant Asian cities . It states: ‘Globally, the UK is considered the number one destination for those seeking a new domicile, although American is still more popular with the super-rich from Asia.’ Knight Frank's Liam Bailey attributed London's success to its cosmopolitan reputation and status as a hub for the wealthy from all sorts of different places. 'London wins over New York,' he told the Guardian. 'It's more diverse. There are more nationalities living here and it's a more global city.' However, Asian cities are set to overtake the West in future years, with places such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing competing to become Asia's top hub. Despite the ravages of the financial crisis and global recession, the number of the super-wealthy around the world is expected to increase at a sharp pace. There are set to be 30 per cent more people with at least £18million in assets by 2023 - and in Africa, the number is forecast to double over the decade. Glimpse of the future: This graphic shows how Asia and Africa are expected to produce many more super-rich people over the coming decade . Soaring: Since the depths of the financial crisis, London's 'prime' property prices have risen 50 per cent . The consequence of London’s popularity is the crippling cost of a home in the capital. A home in the most exclusive area, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, costs an average of £1.2million, according to the Land Registry. 1) London - 4,224 'ultra high net worth individuals' 2) Tokyo - 3,525 . 3) Singapore - 3,154 . 4) New York - 2,929 . 5) Hong Kong - 2,560 . A decade ago, the same home would have cost £490,000. Knight Frank examined what you could buy in cities around the world for $1million (around £600,00). In ‘prime’ London, you could buy just 25.2 square metres, which is the equivalent of just a double bedroom. London is beaten only by Monaco and Hong Kong which are even more expensive. Of the 20 cities which were investigated, property is cheapest in Cape Town where $1million would usually buy a 215 square metre home with five double bedrooms. Knight Frank's report suggests a number of factors which could transform the international property market - including the tantalising possibility of sub-orbital space flight. These flights, which could allow the ultra-rich to travel from London to Sydney in just two hours, would help far-flung areas at the expense of more centrally located regions such as western Europe.","Capital of the UK has more members of the super-rich than anywhere else .

Savers will be crippled by ‘several more years’ of rock-bottom interest rates in a form of financial torture that has already lasted for five years, experts warned last night. It was exactly five years ago today that the Bank of England made the emergency move to halve the base rate to 0.5 per cent. Prudent savers have been robbed of more than £300 billion by the Bank’s decision due to dire interest rates as well as their nest egg’s loss of spending power as the cost of living has risen. Savers will be crippled by 'several more years' of rock-bottom interest rates in a form of financial torture that has already lasted for five years, experts warned last night . While homeowners have benefited from low mortgage repayments, at the same time there has been a devastating impact on the lives of savers and an erosion of Britain’s savings culture. The consultancy Capital Economics said it does not expect the Bank to increase the base rate from 0.5 per cent ‘until late next year.’ And even when interest rates do start to rise, the Bank has repeatedly made clear that the increases will be ‘gradual’. Danny Cox, head of financial planning at Hargreaves Lansdown, the financial advisers, said: ‘Interest rates look set to remain low for longer. ‘Even when rates do begin to rise, savers are likely to face several more years of low returns on their hard-earned cash.’ A family with a £100,000 mortgage is paying around £3,300 a year less on interest payments on their loan, according to Dr Ros Altmann, the former Downing Street adviser. But savers with a £100,000 nest egg are getting around £4,260 a year less in interest. The Bank of England's governor, Mark Carney, used his first speech as governor last August to express his 'tremendous sympathy' for savers . Overall, she calculates savers are £18,500 worse off since January 2008, the depth of the financial crisis. Dr Altman said: ‘The message being sent is: ‘You’re a mug to save.’ Simon Rose, from Save our Savers, said: ‘Who could possibly believe that five years on, savers are still being punished? ‘It is foolish in the extreme and it is going to end in tears.’ ‘Who could possibly believe that five years on, savers are still being punished?' Simon Rose, Save our Savers . The Bank’s governor, Mark Carney, used his first speech as governor last August to express his ‘tremendous sympathy’ for savers. He said they had ‘done the right thing, set money aside and now they are earning returns that are substantially below what they would have expected.’ Save our Saver’s research looked at Britain’s £1.2trillion balance of cash savings, held in everything from savings accounts to tax-free cash Isas. It compares how much interest they have been paid for their nest eggs, compared to how much they would have got if rates had been kept at their pre-crisis levels in March 2008. The total amount of ‘lost interest’ over the last five years is £117billion, according to Save our Savers. But this is not the end of the pain inflicted on savers. In a second blow, their nest eggs have also been hit by the rising cost of living, which has reduced the spending power of their money. The loss of spending power is £209billion over the last five years, based on a calculation using the retail prices index measure of inflation. This makes a total ‘loss’ of £326billion. To put this vast number into context, this is around 12 times the total amount of money which people will pay in council tax this year. By Simon Lambert, editor of This is Money, MailOnline's financial section . Simon Lambert: Savings rates are terrible right now . There is no real way of dressing up savings rates at the moment - they are absolutely awful. The first week in March should be the height of what the financial industry calls Isa season, the time of the year when savers rush to use their tax-free savings allowance before it runs out at the end of the tax year at the start of April. This traditionally also means a rush of new savings accounts arriving on the scene, as banks and building societies try to tempt customers away from rivals by nudging up rates. This year, Isa season is a dud. We compile our own independent This is Money savings tables. It's safe to say we haven't been overwhelmed with the offers trickling in. The best rate you can find on an instant access savings account is 1.75 per cent from Britannia - and even then you are limited to two withdrawals a year. The next best easy access account with no limits on withdrawals, which can be opened online is from National Counties Building Society at 1.65 per cent. You can get better rates for locking in your money, with the highest rate a 3 per cent five-year fix from Skipton. But to get that you have to commit to not getting at your cash until 2019. To find the best tax-free savings deal, bookmark This is Money's Five of the best Isas round-up, which is updated throughout the year. Rates like this lead people to question whether it is even worth bothering with an Isa. But the answer to that question is, 'yes, they make it even more important.' This is because we are taxed on our savings interest at our income tax rate, with 20 per cent taken off by your bank and those who pay higher rate tax having to hand over the rest via their tax return. That tax eats into the rate you get, driving savings rates even lower. But in an Isa you get all your interest tax-free. If you could find an instant access savings account matching that best Isa rate of 1.75 per cent, which incidentally you can't, then after 20 per cent tax you would only really be getting 1.4 per cent and after 40 per cent tax you would get 1.05 per cent. Annual Isa allowances come with a use it, or lose it status. Everyone can save up to £5,760 into an Isa this tax year, which ends on 5 April 2014, it is then gone. They then get a new allowance for 2014 to 2015, of £5,940. Crucially, however, you can put money into a new Isa and transfer all your existing Isa savings pots into a new better deal if you can find one. That means savers need to do two things. Firstly, make sure new savings go into an Isa and that they make the most of their allowance each year and, secondly, make sure all their existing Isa savings are getting the best rate possible and move them if need be. When savings rates are this bad it only makes more sense to use an Isa.","Bank of England made the move to half the base rate to 0.5per cent in 2009 .

A 30-year-old Minneapolis man faces charges after allegedly suffocating his infant son after falling asleep and rolling on top of him, after a night of drinking. Nathan Savage from Eagan, was charged with manslaughter and child neglect in the death of his two-month-old son Nolan Sikich on October 19th. According to the charges, Savage, his fiancee and friends had been drinking for the couple's anniversary.

A police report says he had been drinking the night before and this may have contributed to the death of their newborn baby boy . Prosecutors say Nolan was crying so Savage gave him a bottle and took him to bed with him, laying the infant's head on his chest. The next morning he awoke at approximately 5:55 a.m. to the childâ€™s mother shaking him and frantically asking where the child was, . Savage said that was when he discovered he had been laying on top of the infant. Police were called to the home of 30-year-old Nathan Scott Savage just before 6 a.m. on Oct. 19 and were met by the child's mother, who was crying and screaming, 'How could you have done this to our child?'

Nothing to celebrate: Janelle Sikich and Nathan Savage had been out partying. Nathan fell asleep on the bed with his baby son Nolan laying on his chest. During the night, he rolled over and crushed the baby boy, accidentally killing him .

The banker's family are downsizing from their Gloucestershire pile and cannot fit their hoard of heirlooms into their new, smaller home. Under the hammer: A retired city banker is auctioning hundreds of items after selling his Gloucestershire farm and downsizing. One of the most valuable items for sale is this still life painting by Dutch artist . Pieter Gerritsz van Roestraten, it is expected to reach £20,000 at Friday's auction .

The colourful collection includes marble candelabras, a huge exotic painting of a tiger, a Cambodian silver elephant and handmade Liberty carpets. Experts at Gloucestershire-based auctioneers Dominic Winter reckon the mass could go for more than £300,000 - but admitted it could be far more. Auctioneer Henry Meadows said: 'Basically we are look at the principal contents of a very nice Gloucestershire country house. 'The owners are downsizing and the items are surplus now so it has all had to come to auction. They are moving to a much smaller house. 'The man who owns it was quite prolific at buying from Sotheby’s and Christie’s in the 1970s to the 1990s in particular. 'He was no stranger to an auction house and bought from all over the world - Monaco, London, New York. 'It is certainly very nice to get this size of collection, amassed from all of these places, right here in the Cotswolds. 'People really could pick up quite a bargain with this one.

Sharmila Mistry, 42, from Busby, Leicestershire, is accused of causing the deaths of two toddlers when she was distracted by a mobile phone call . Two toddlers who were killed when a BMW driver crashed while speaking on her phone would not have died if she had not been speeding, a court today heard. Accounts . manager Sharmila Mistry, 42, was rushing to a meeting when she crashed . into a Mini Cooper, then swerved into the children in their pushchairs. She . was making a call on a hands-free mobile device and did not notice as a . car began to cross the junction ahead of her, the court heard. The . BMW hit the other driver’s Mini Cooper, then allegedly ploughed into Zofia . Tabaka, two, and 21-month-old Oliwier Baczyk as they waited at a . pedestrian crossing with family members. Oliwier . and Zofia, whose parents are Polish, died of head injuries later that . day. On Tuesday Mistry went on trial at Leicester Crown Court accused of two counts of causing death by careless driving. She denies the offences. Mistry’s BMW 520d executive saloon was seen accelerating towards the . junction in Leicester and was exceeding the 30mph speed limit, the . Today the court heard how the crash could have been prevented had Mistry being travelling at the correct speed limit. Jurors were told the mother-of-two had been driving her BMW 5-Series at 36.7mph on the 30mph limit road when she passed through an amber traffic light. Prosecutor James Thomas told the court if Mistry had been travelling at the correct speed she would have stopped short of hitting the pedestrians by at least 5m (16ft). He said that instead she only had 2.2 seconds to react and her overall stopping distance increased to 51.7 metres and the children were 51.4 metres away. Her excessive speed resulted in her vehicle ploughing into the Polish toddlers resulting in their deaths, it was claimed. Mr Thomas added that using hands-free mobile phones were as dangerous as speaking on a handset and it had undoubtedly caused a loss of concentration. He said: 'It is not a disputed fact that Mrs Mistry at the time of the collision she was engaged in a mobile telephone call. 'There have been some surveys on the use of mobile phones while driving. 'They have compared the effect of using mobile phones when holding the devices as compared to when using a hands free device. 'The survey concluded hand held and hands free were equally attention demanding and caused some amount of loss in concentration.' Jurors were told the driver of the Mini Christopher Andrews, 61, crossed the junction on Mistry’s right hand side on a red light having been confused by road work signals. He was travelling at 24mph at the time of the collision. Giving evidence PC Timothy O’Donnell, from Leicestershire Police’s serious collision unit, told the court: 'On collision with the BMW the Mini came to a stop and the Mini rotated clockwise 90 degrees. 'The BMW mounted the kerb and by that point the breaks had been applied. 'The BMW then collided with a traffic light post and pedestrian control box and almost immediately after the BMW collided with the pedestrians.' Evidence: PC Timothy O'Donnell (left) arriving at Leicester Crown Court to give evidence. The court heard the crash would not have happened if Mistry (right) had been driving within the speed limit . Killed: Oliwier Baczyck, 21 months, and Zofia Tabaka, two, were fatally injured after the accident in Leicster . Terror: The two toddlers (circled left) could be seen on CCTV footage sat in their pushchairs just moments before a car driven by Mistry (right) mounted the pavement and smashed into them . Mini driver . Christopher Andrews had become confused by roadworks and was crossing . the junction against a red light, prosecutor James Thomas said. In . the build-up to the tragedy on the morning of August 6, 2012, Mistry . overtook a van and, according to a witness, sped towards the junction, . passing through the traffic lights just after they had turned to amber. Mr . Thomas told the hearing at Leicester Crown Court:  ‘Mistry was engaged . in a mobile phone call on hands-free. She did not notice Mr Andrews . enter the junction. ‘As the Mini drove across the junction it collided with the front off-side of the defendant’s BMW. ‘That . diverted her BMW directly into the path of the children as they were . sat in their pushchairs waiting to cross the road. 'The consequences were . devastating and ultimately fatal. ‘The . prosecution case is that their deaths resulted from a combination of . the driving of Christopher Andrews and Sharmila Mistry, which the . prosecution say fell below the standard expected of a competent and . careful driver.’ Scene: The two children were waiting with two adults at this junction in Leicester when they were hit by a car . 'RIP baby angels': Floral tributes were left at the scene where the two young children were hit by the car . Mr Thomas told the court Mistry ‘neither braked nor took evasive action’ before the collision. ‘Her vehicle was struck by Mr Andrews’ Mini and only after did she apply the brakes,’ he said. Zofia’s . father, Lucas Tabaka, had been pushing her, while Oliwier was . accompanied by an uncle, Kamil Komar. Both adults, who had been shopping . with the children, escaped with minor injuries. Crash . investigators discovered Mistry, who denies two counts of causing death . by careless driving, was travelling at 36mph when she collided with the . Mini. Motorist Matthew Smith told the court how Mistry’s BMW went ‘flying’ past him as he slowed for the amber light at the junction. He said: ‘The BMW got sent off to the left. She did try to correct herself but was going too fast.’ Mr Smith said that after the crash he saw a woman climb out of the BMW, shouting: ‘I’m so sorry.’ The . court heard 61-year-old Mr Andrews had ‘misconstrued’ a green light . telling traffic to turn left, believing he could cross the junction. He . has since died in circumstances unrelated to the case. Car: A Facebook picture of a black BMW on the profile of Sharmila Mistry, who appeared in court this morning . Mr Thomas said that had Mistry been travelling at the speed limit she would have had time to brake. After . her arrest, Mistry, of Bushby, Leicestershire, told police she had been . driving the BMW, which costs from £30,000, ‘carefully and . consistently’. She denied accelerating towards the junction. In a statement read to the court, Mr Tabaka said the group were hit as they waited on an island to  cross the dual carriageway. ‘I suddenly saw the red Mini Cooper collide with a grey BMW,’ he said. ‘I . tried to pull away the pushchair with my daughter in it, but the car . hit both pushchairs. I was still holding the pushchair but her little . head was bowed down and blood was coming down her face.’ In his statement, Mr Komar said he saw the female driver ‘motionless’ after the crash, ‘with a mobile phone in her hand’. The trial continues. Later, the court heard heartbreaking evidence from Lucas Tabaka, father of two-year-old Zofia. In a statement read to the court by Mr Thomas, Mr Tabaka - who was waiting at the side of the road with family friend Kamil Komar, who was pushing Oliwier, told of the moment his daughter was struck by the BMW. He said: 'Because the lights were on green we crossed half of the road and stopped on island. 'I suddenly saw the red Mini Cooper collide with a grey BMW. 'I shouted to Kamil ""Watch out"". I tried to pull away the pushchair with my daughter in it but the car hit both pushchairs with the children in them. Scene: Marking on the pavement indicate where the children were struck as they waited in their pushchairs . 'I was still holding the pushchair but her little head was bowed down and blood was coming down her face. 'I was screaming and shouting at a man who came to help to check her breathing.  Oliwier was on the ground in a pool of blood.' In his statement Mr Komar, who is the cousin of Oliwier's mother, Miroslawa, said: 'Lucas asked me to join him for a walk. Defendant: Sharmila Mistry, 42, denies two counts of causing death by careless driving . 'Oliwier always wanted to push the crossing button. I heard a terrible bang and someone shout ""Watch out"". 'My immediate reaction was to pull the pushchair away. I saw Oliwier on the floor and heard Lucas shout ""Save my beloved daughter"". 'I just had a grazed chin. I saw the female driver motionless with a mobile phone in her hand.' Motorist Matthew Smith told the court how Mistry's BMW came 'flying' past him as he slowed for an amber light. He . said he believed she drove through a red light, but the jury earlier . heard she passed through just 0.8 seconds before it the signal changed . from amber to red. Mr Smith added: 'I saw the BMW quite far back from myself. 'It . was driving at some speed. I say that because of the rate it caught me . up.  As the BMW went past me I caught a glimpse of the red Mini and they . collided. 'The BMW got sent off to the left. She did try to correct herself but was going too fast.' Mr Smith told the jury a woman climbed out of the BMW shouting ""I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry"".' He added: 'She was a bit distraught. I didn't really take much notice of her because we were too busy seeing what we could do.'

It leaves crimson stains on the green sweatshirt she is wearing. Yet the look on this girl's face appears strangely serene, resigned. This portrait of a wounded schoolgirl tells the story of the horrific toll on innocents caught in the cross-fire on the frontline of Syria's brutal civil war. She was photographed in an Aleppo clinic by Swedish freelance photographer Niclas Hammarström, whose work has just earned him Unicef's Photo of the Year award. A panel of judges hailed the picture for highlighting the plight of youngsters in war-torn Syria. Haunting: Dania Kilsi, 11, lies covered in her own blood as she is treated for shrapnel wounds in Dar al-Shifa hospital in Aleppo, Syria, on October 15, 2012. She and her two siblings, Zaid, two, and Fatima, six, were rushed to the clinic after they were hurt by shrapnel from a nearby explosion as they were playing outside their home . Mr Hammarström met Dania Kilsi in October 2012 while spending a day covering the struggles of medical staff treating the wounded at Dar-al-Shifa hospital. The 11-year-old had been playing outside with her brother and sister when she was hit in the face by shrapnel from an exploding shell. The photo shows Dania's head being cradled in her oldest brother's hands while her wounds are dressed. She was able to return home shortly after, but the hospital was destroyed just a few months later. After three years of civil war, almost half of Syria's children live in a state of acute emergency, according to Unicef estimates. About three million children no longer attend school and there is hardly on among them who has not faced violence and destruction or lost a family member. Due to the destruction of the medical infrastructure, the agency warns, wounded civilians can no longer be treated and hitherto well-managed diseases such as polio are on the rise. Mr Hammarström told Der Spiegel: 'I . was spending 24 hours in the hospital documenting the work of the . doctors there, particularly when it came to injured children. 'About . 350 patients were in the clinic that day, there was a lot of blood. There were people shot and wounded, people missing arms and legs, . children with severe burns, or even cases like Dania.' Despite being badly bloodied, Dania was thankfully not badly hurt. 'She . had played with her ​​siblings outside and was hit by shrapnel in the . face,' said Mr Hammarström. 'Luckily there were probably no serious . injuries. They were treated in the hospital [and] after an hour they . could go back.' Award: Niclas Hammarstrom from Sweden poses in front his photograph, the winner of Unicef Photo of the Year 2013, which he captured while spending 24 hours documenting the work of medics at Dar-al-Shifa hospital. The photo shows Dania's head being cradled in her oldest brother's hands while her wounds are dressed . Syria is currently one of the most dangerous countries in the world for journalists, with 30 killed covering its civil war last year. In 28 cases the motive was confirmed to be linked to their newsgathering activities. Mr Hammarström, a father of three, was last November kidnapped and held hostage along with another journalist for six weeks, during which he was tortured. He was only released at the beginning of this year, and prefers not to talk about his ordeal. Mr Hammarström's photo is the 14th winner of Unicef's Photo of the Year award, organised each year by the agency's German committee in cooperation with GEO Magazine. Daniela Schadt, patroness of UNICEF Germany, said: 'The Photo of the Year shows the face of the Syrian civil war - the face of an injured and severely traumatized child. 'The look on the child's face is an appeal to the international community to strengthen its diplomatic and humanitarian efforts in order to prevent the loss of an entire generation of children.' Still a frontline: Opposition fighters open fire at pro-regime forces in the on the outskirts of Aleppo yesterday. After three years of civil war, almost half of Syria's children live in a state of acute emergency, according to Unicef estimates . Jury chairman Professor Klaus Honnef added: 'The photo series of Unicef's competition captures more than meets the eye. They also succeed in summarising and analysing the story behind the picture. 'They enable us to better understand the reality of children under very different circumstances.' Unicef provides help to children on both sides of the conflict, in Syria and refugees who have fled to its neighbouring countries. Unicef, the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), Mercy Corps, Save the Children and World Vision are asking people across the world to voice their outrage at the devastating impact of the Syria's war on children.

Second World War veteran Frank Worsley died from a stroke less than three weeks after being punched by jobless drug user Daniel Crompton, while he lay helpless in bed, Manchester Crown Court heard. Jurors looked visibly shocked as Mr Worsley’s frantic 999 call was played to the court, where he begged the operator: 'Help me please. He’s hit me and beaten me and attacked me and taken my wallet.' Couple: Frank Worsley (left), with his wife Mary, died three weeks after the brutal beating at his home in Bolton Greater Manchester . Crompton, 24, woke the elderly man up and began being punching in the face while he demanded to know where he kept the money in his Bolton, Greater Manchester, terrace home. The court heard the father-of-one had financial problems relating to payday loans, but was still a regular user of the Class A drug. Mr Worsley, who was also a Sunday school teacher, had lived in the property with his wife Mary, since 1949, and had put extra locks on doors after they were burgled in 2010. His wife died after suffering multiple sclerosis in 2012, and he was living alone when Crompton burgled his home in August last year. Crompton, from Bolton, admits the burglary, plus a second burglary hours before, but denies the murder and an alternate count of the manslaughter. The court heard that, despite suffering from a heart condition, Mr Worsley was still active and regularly 'out and about'. He took blood thinning medication, Warfarin, which prevented his blood from clotting to stave off a heart attack. But after being admitted to the Royal Bolton Hospital for treatment following the attack, doctors had to stop this medication so his blood would clot as a result of the injuries he sustained. Home: Mr Worsley had lived in the property with his wife Mary, since 1949. The couple had put extra locks on doors after they were burgled in 2010 . But Mr Worsley then suffered a stroke on August 7 last year and died on August 20 after his condition deteriorated rapidly. 'The crown say that this is murder,' Rob Hall, prosecuting, told the jury. Mr Hall said that last July, Crompton and his girlfriend Beverley Hardman, the mother of his son, Mason, had money problems but the defendant was a 'regular user of cocaine'. 'It is a combination of money worries and, the Crown say, Mr Crompton’s desire to purchase more cocaine that caused him to burgle Mr Worsley’s house in the early hours of August 3 last year.' Mr Worsley had left a bathroom window open at the back of his house which Crompton climbed through. 'Mr Worsley awoke to find the defendant standing over him,' Mr Hall said. 'The defendant began to shout ""Where’s your money?"". Terrified: The jury at Manchester Crown Court heard the horrifying 999 call where Mr Worsley begged the operator for help . 'Mr Worsley told Mr Crompton he did not have any money. 'Mr Crompton then removed his vest and wrapped it around his right hand. 'What Mr Crompton then did took this incident to a whole new level. This was not just burglary.'What he chose to do was to beat the defenceless Mr Worsley repeatedly in the face.' Mr Worsley still refused to comply with the demands so Crompton snatched a wallet and chequebook instead - but left his palmprint on a window frame as he escaped. Jurors were played the 999 call from the distressed pensioner, breathing heavily and struggling to hear the operator. 'Help me, please!' he said. 'I’ve been attacked by somebody who’s broken in. I was asleep and he just woke me up.' Treatment: Mr Worsley was taken to Bolton Royal Infirmary after the attack, but three weeks later . Asked how he was, Mr Worsley replied: 'Shocked.' The victim was left with a cut lip and bruising but 'under the surface' there were more significant injuries - a subdural bleed on the right side of his brain. Crompton returned to a friend’s house after the attack, sweating, with grazes and scratches on his face, but with cash and a gram of cocaine. Just hours before, Crompton, also burgled the house of a friend, stealing a TV and computer. He was arrested for burglary and robbery and in custody when police charged him with murder following Mr Worsley’s death in hospital.

Damning: Jose Mourinho, pictured with his wife Tami, says young footballers want to be rich before they've kicked a ball in the Premier League . Modern footballers demand riches before they 'play one single match' and 'queue in front of the mirror' because they are more interested in their image than becoming greats, Jose Mourinho has said. The outspoken Chelsea manager says society has changed and produced a younger generation more interested in money, fame and celebrity than 'winning titles'. The 51-year-old paid tribute to John Terry and Frank Lampard, saying they understood to be 'fanatical about victories' meant they would be 'rich before the end of their careers'. But he added that footballers are overpaid because 'others do more to benefit humanity' and finding young people who put winning over wealth is difficult. 'You have to find the right boy: the boy who wants to succeed, has pride and passion for the game,' he told Esquire magazine. 'His dream is not one more million or one less million, his dream is to play at the highest level, to win titles, because if you do these things you’ll be rich the same at the end of your career. 'What I feel is that before, players were trying to make money during their career, be rich at the end of their career. But in this moment, the people who surround them try to make them rich before they start their career. 'They try to make them rich when they sign their first contract, when they didn't play one single match in the Premier League, when they don't know what it is to play in the Champions League. This puts the clubs in difficult conditions sometimes. 'So we are working hard to give the best orientation to young players, to follow examples of guys from the past — the Lampards, the Terrys — who were always fanatical for victories.'. Mourinho is one of the world's most successful managers, having played football himself at a low level in his native Portugal before he made his big break after he became an interpreter for Sir Bobby Robson when he was manager of Barcelona. He then forged his own managerial career later winning the Champions' League twice, with FC Porto and Inter Milan. He is in his second spell at Chelsea, having managed Real Madrid for three years before returning to Stamford Bridge. The Special One said it was while in the Spanish capital he saw vanity from his squad, which included Cristiano Ronaldo. 'Lots . of times at Real Madrid, the players would be queuing in front of the . mirror before the game while the referee waited for them in the tunnel,' he said. Critical: The Special One says while at Real Madrid, where Cristiano Ronaldo is a star, players 'would be queuing in front of the mirror before the game' Outspoken: Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho told Esquire he is desperate to find teenagers  with 'pride and passion for the game' above a dreams of being wealthy . 'But that’s how society is now. Young people care a lot about this: they are twenty something and I am 51 and if I want to work with kids I have to understand their world. How can I stop my players on the bus doing, er, what do you call?…Twitters and these things? How can I stop them if my daughter and my son do the same? So, I have to adapt to the moment.' Mourinho told Esquire footballers do 'earn too much money' and despite the pressures of the Premier League and working for Roman Abramovich, 'nothing' stops him sleeping. 'I sleep seven, eight hours every night. I cannot compare my job with the doctor who is doing heart surgery. There is much more responsibility for him than for me. 'That’s why I sometimes feel that we earn too much money compared to people who do much more than us to benefit humanity. What is football? Football is emotion. No more than that.' Winners: Jose Mourinho has praised the 'fanaticism for victory' of Frank Lampard and John Terry . He added that his wife and daughter are not fussed about football because they are 'more intelligent'. 'In our house, it’s two and two. Mum and daughter isolated of football. They like me to win and they care about my happiness, but they don’t live for football. And obviously the boy [José Jr] is a boy, and at this age — 13, 14, 15 — he gets involved in the game, too. So, it’s two for football and two who are more intelligent than the men of the house'.","Special One says  teenagers want cash and celebrity before 'winning titles'

A grandmother has spoken of how she feels as if she is constantly seasick after she was diagnosed with a rare condition following a cruise. Diane Morley, 63 said she feels as if she is dizzy and swaying all of the time and has trouble doing everyday tasks. The mother-of-one was diagnosed with the rare condition Mal de Debarquement Syndrome a few months after a Norwegian cruise holiday with her husband Dennis with firm Fred Olsen. Diane Morley, 63 said she feels as if she is dizzy and swaying all of the time and has trouble doing everyday tasks because of her condition . Mrs Morley, of Herne Bay, Kent, told MailOnline she believes the condition, which is thought to be incurable, was triggered by one particularly choppy night aboard the Black Watch cruise ship in September 2012. She said: 'We had a fantastic time. There was one bad night when we went out to the North Sea and it was a bit choppy. 'It was like sleeping in a washing machine that night, but the following day was absolutely fine. 'I was absolutely fine but then we came back to Norway seven days later.

Mrs Morley said although she does not drink alcohol or coffee, her condition has at times left others believing she was drunk. She said she once had to leave an event at a holiday camp after the bright lights and music affected her condition. She said she told a man as she was leaving that she had problems with her balance. She said: 'I don't drink but he thought I looked drunk.' Mrs Morley, who is now a member of the MdDS Foundation, said she believed the rough night at sea on the cruise has contributed to the condition, although there has been no way of confirming this. She said: 'The feeling you get is like I'm aboard and I'm trying to get my balance. 'I'm swaying all the time and trying to get my balance normal.' Mrs Morley said the condition is believed to be incurable, although she does use valium to help relieve the symptoms. Mal de Debarquement Syndrome, or 'disembarkment syndrome', is a rare condition which causes a persistent sensation of motion, often described as swaying or difficulty maintaining balance. According to the MdDS Balance Disorder Foundation, the condition often develops after an ocean cruise or other type of travel on water. It has however also been reported following air, train and road travel. The symptoms of motion can also be associated with anxiety, fatigue and difficulty maintaining balance. It is believed to be a neurological syndrome with no known cause or cure. There have been reports however of the symptoms actually improving when the sufferer is travelling in a car, train, plane or boat. Research into the condition is taking place through imaging studies.","Diane Morley feels as if she is dizzy all the time because of rare condition .

Health and social services staff have been criticised in a report into the 'preventable' death of a five-month-old baby who died from acute rickets. The parents of Ndingeko Kunene were jailed for manslaughter by gross negligence last week after they failed to obtain medical help for their sick child. Nkosiyapha, 36, and Virginia Kunene, 32, who are members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, prayed for their child's recovery rather than seek medical help, the Old Bailey heard. Nkosiyapha Kunene (right) and his wife Virginia (left) were jailed for manslaughter by gross negligence last week at the Old Bailey. The couple prayed for their child's recovery rather than seek medical help, the court heard . The couple refused medical treatment for their son on religious grounds until he died from a severe vitamin D deficiency. A Serious Case Review has now found a catalogue of failures and says: 'A number of opportunities to protect the baby were missed.' The report, published today, says there was a 'consistent lack or professional curiosity' into the family, from Erith, Kent. The report, which calls the infant 'Baby F', says the attitude of health visitors was 'extremely optimistic' and there was a lack of monitoring by agencies and a failure of communication between them. The family doctor failed to promote vitamin D and staff were confused over forms. The report, from Bexley Local Safeguarding Children Board, said: 'This was a preventable death and a number of opportunities to protect Baby F were missed. A Serious Case Review has now found a catalogue of failures and says: 'A number of opportunities to protect the baby were missed' A spokesman for Bexley's Local Safeguarding Children's Board said it was ensuring 'lessons have been learnt'. Pictured is Bexley Council . 'The GP should have been aware of the importance of breastfeeding mothers to take vitamin D supplements and this would have been even more relevant in Mrs F’s case. 'The health visitor’s visit was extraordinarily optimistic and the parents were seen to be very co-operative. 'There was a lack of any agency checks, which if undertaken is likely to have provided a more complete picture of the risks.' 'This was a preventable death and a number of opportunities to protect Baby F were missed' - From the Serious Case Review by Bexley Safeguarding Children Board . The report says the baby had not been seen by any professionals in the three and a half months prior to his death. It says: 'The nature of the spiritual beliefs and sanctions articulated by his mother were extreme and should have raised both concern and questioning. 'There was a consistent lack of professional curiosity and challenge to both parents and other professionals. 'During this period (after Ndingeko was born) communications between professionals does not appear to have been effective in particular between the hospital, the GP and the health visitor.' The report added: 'There were three separate occasions when concerns should have been raised. This included the rapid response meeting. Rickets is a disease, which affects bone development in children. The condition causes bones to become soft and weak, leading to deformities. In adults the disease is referred to as osteomalacia or soft bones. The most common cause of rickets is a lack of Vitamin D and calcium. Vitamin D is essential for children to form strong bones and comes from exposure to sunlight. It is also found in oily foods, including fish and eggs. In rare cases, some children are born with a genetic form of the disease. Rickets is referred to as a Victorian-era disease, due to its prominence at the turn of the century. It has largely disappeared in the Western world, thanks to the rise in Vitamin D enriched foods, including margarine and cereals. But in recent years, experts have warned of an increasing number of cases in the UK. While still relatively small numbers - 900 cases were diagnosed in 2012 - studies have revealed a high number of people in the UK have low levels of Vitamin D in their blood. Any child with a lack of Vitamin D in their diet can develop the disease. But the condition is more prevalent in children with dark skin, due to the fact more sunlight is needed to deliver enough Vitamin D. Those born premature and children taking medication that can interfere with Vitamin D are also at a higher risk of developing the disease. Rickets is easily prevented. A child's hands and face only have to be exposed to sunlight for around 15 minutes several times a week in spring and summer to provide enough of the vital Vitamin. That combined with a healthy diet incorporating Vitamin D and calcium-rich foods help strengthen the bones. 'It is unclear why there was a breakdown in multi- agency working in this respect. 'Evidence suggests, whilst agencies reference that they recognise and understand the role of the local authority designated officer, there is little evidence of engagement.' It has emerged that staff were partly reassured because the baby’s father worked as a nurse at King’s College Hospital in south-east London. The couple, strict vegetarians due to their beliefs, had known their son was unwell for two months but chose prayer over medical treatment. After his death, tests showed Ndingeko had been suffering from rickets – a disease common in Victorian times caused by severe lack of vitamin D and associated with a poor diet and lack of sunlight. The Zimbabwean-born couple, from Erith, Kent, admitted manslaughter. Nkosiyapha Kunene, 36, was jailed for three years and his 32-year-old wife for two years and three months last Friday. Barbara Trevanion, independent chair of Bexley Safeguarding Children’s Board, said lessons had been learnt and improvements made. She said yesterday: 'It was a very unusual case which highlights the importance of vitamin D, particularly given the mother was vegan. 'My health colleagues have already done a lot of work on promoting the importance of this vitamin as a direct result of this case.' Ms Trevanion added that one of the main problems in the case had been with the balance between family privacy and protection. She said: 'Everybody has a right to protect their religion but not to the extent that it puts lives at risk. 'People are very respectful of others’ religion and tradition and sometimes that can cloud the rights of the child. 'The father was a nurse as well, which felt like reassurance. However, there had been early indications there was some risk involved.' Ms Trevanion said Bexley’s Council’s children’s services have come a long way since Ofsted described them as 'inadequate' in a number of key areas in August 2012 – two months after Ndingeko’s death. She said: 'We are doing our best to implement the report’s recommendations and we have made real improvement in Bexley since the inspection. 'We all do our best to make sure those children are safe and this goes for the community as well.' A spokesman for Bexley's Local Safeguarding Children's Board told MailOnline: 'This very sad death happened nearly two years ago and involved an extremely complex and unusual set of circumstances. 'The LSCB have conducted a thorough review and we are ensuring that lessons have been learnt. 'A number of improvements have been made in respect of communications between agencies as well as increasing awareness of the importance of vitamin D supplements. 'We agree with the judges summary that whilst it is important to respect religious views of parents this should never divert focus from the welfare of a child. 'Ensuring that we protect Bexley’s vulnerable children and young people is a responsibility that we take very seriously. Ensuring that we do everything possible to safeguard them is our number one priority.'","Parents Ndingeko Kunene jailed for manslaughter at Old Bailey last week .

Wannabe: Aspiring singer Elaine Rennie has had her guitar and amp confiscated after she was found performing in Newcastle at 4am . An aspiring musician and X Factor hopeful has been stripped of her guitar and amp after serenading drinkers leaving Newcastle's bars and clubs at 4am. Elaine Rennie, a former Stars In Their Eyes finalist, appeared in court after breaching an order banning her from performing late-night shows in the city. The singer, who entertained the crowds on her electric guitar, has seen her 'bespoke, irreplaceable and unique' amplifier, confiscated at Newcastle Magistrates' Court. The 42-year-old, from North Tyneside, said the court order will derail her dreams of pursuing a professional musical career, and rule out her chance to perform on X Factor. She said: 'My equipment was seized four days before I had an X Factor audition in Glasgow. 'I just couldn’t perform, I just broke down in tears. I was just so shocked because I thought I would have had my amp. 'I’ve been singing since I was a child. I’ve got a lot of fans and I’ve never had anything bad written about me.' Rennie received 175,000 votes when she performed as her heroine Belinda Carlisle on the Stars In Their Eyes in 1999. She won her heat and was watched by 12million viewers in the live final. In the aftermath of the performance she played across the North East and Europe with her band, The Bumble Bees, and also appeared on Chris Evans’ Breakfast Show. But she says she now takes part in street performances - including outside St James’ Park - as practise for her fledgling music career and says she donates all her earnings to church and an animal sanctuary. She said: 'I always give the money away to charities. This year I’m going to try to go on the X Factor and also Britain’s Got Talent.' Rennie said her re-make of Belinda Carlisle’s Leave a Light On reached the second spot in the dance charts in 2011 and was in the top 40 of the European charts. Council chiefs - as part of a clampdown on nuisance noise in Newcastle - have drawn up a code of practice for buskers to stop residents being hounded with music. Rennie has racked-up five offences of operating a loud speaker and creating noise pollution, magistrates were told. Scroll down for video . Dreams dashed: The X Factor hopeful said her dreams of appearing on the show were dashed when Newcastle City Council's night-time noise team confiscated her guitar last April, days before she was due to audition . Plea: During a hearing at Newcastle Magistrates¿ Court, Rennie begged chairman of the bench Barry Wagstaff not to take her amplifier, offering to pay a £2,000 fine and pleading: 'I¿d give my life for that amp' Therapy: Tim Gregory, mitigating for Rennie, said his client will appeal the decision. He told the court she has suffered mental health issues, adding: 'Her music has been her main therapy and it¿s very important to her to keep on playing' But when a night-time noise team from Newcastle City Council spotted her playing her guitar outside The Gate complex on April 28 last year, they approached her and confiscated her equipment. During a hearing at Newcastle Magistrates’ Court, Rennie begged chairman of the bench Barry Wagstaff not to take her amplifier, offering to pay a £2,000 fine and pleading: 'I’d give my life for that amp.' Tim Gregory, mitigating for Rennie, said his client would appeal the decision to confiscate her amp and claimed she had not received the noise abatement notice. He said the amp was a present from her late aunt and had been specifically tuned for her voice by a specialist who is now retired. He told the court: 'She’s got a long history of mental health problems including obsessive compulsive disorder and bi-polar condition. 'Her music has been her main therapy and it’s very important to her to keep on playing.' Finalist: In 1999 Elaine Rennie appeared on Stars In Their Eyes, performing as her heroine Belinda Carlisle. She received 175,000 votes and was watched by 12million viewers in the final . Idol: Rennie is set to meet Belinda Carlisle (pictured) in May . He added: 'She wants to make a go of it in the music industry. She’s got various options open to her - she wants to go on The X Factor and other music programmes. 'She’s signed on to a music company and she’s got a CD. She works for her local church where she performs.' Rennie also claimed her public performances acts are 'therapy' for her mental health problems and boosts her self-esteem. During a hearing at court this week Mr Wagstaff ordered Rennie to pay a £145 fine, £450 costs and a £20 victim surcharge. Melanie Bulman, prosecuting, told the court a code of conduct introduced for buskers prevented them playing between the hours of 8pm and 10am. She said: 'Buskers tend to operate in certain areas of the city where people move from one licenced premises to another. 'The problem lies with people walking in the vicinity and crowding around the buskers.'","Elaine Rennie, 42, appeared at Newcastle Magistrates' Court .

Detained: Patrick Rock, deputy director of the No 10 policy unit, was arrested by officers of the National Crime Agency almost three weeks ago . The National Crime Agency, dubbed ‘Britain’s FBI’, was plunged into a major secrecy row last night after it refused to comment on its arrest of a top Number 10 aide. Senior officials at the agency maintained total silence on the controversial detention of Patrick Rock. David Cameron’s trusted advisor was spirited away in the middle of the night when officers knocked on the door of his West London home. But in an extraordinary move, the fledgling agency said it would not ‘confirm or deny’ its involvement in any ‘on-going investigation’. This unprecedented declaration hides the fact that hundreds of criminal suspects are being deprived of their liberty in secret. The Daily Mail can reveal that only a tiny proportion of the 350 people arrested by the agency since it opened its doors last October have received any publicity. And this ultra-secrecy stands in stark contrast to every other police force in Britain and recently released official guidance. Police forces will always confirm if an arrest has been made and leaders at the College of Policing state this is clearly in the public interest. They have gone on to add that forces can also identify suspects if there is a policing purpose, for example reassuring the public or tracing other offenders. It is understood the NCA policy was shaped by the Leveson Inquiry, which included a raft of proposals to rein in the freedom of the Press. But it once again highlights concerns that the inquiry into Press standards is enabling police and other officials to withhold key information from the public. It leaves NCA director general Keith Bristow, who once pledged to be open and transparent, vulnerable to accusations of leading the ‘secret police’. On his appointment by Home Secretary Theresa May, Mr Bristow said he would not repeat the mistakes of his predecessors at the Serious Organised Crime Agency, known as Soca. The former Warwickshire chief constable said crime-fighters could not complain about criticism if they failed to tell people what they were doing. Ultra secrecy: The faces of the National Crime Agency officers seen here taking part in a training exercise in South Tyneside were pixelated at the request of the newly formed agency's press team . His predecessor, former MI5 chief Sir Stephen Lander, gained a reputation for extreme secrecy after openly boasting about Soca’s closed doors. The secrecy row is particularly difficult for Mr Bristow because both Mrs May and Mr Cameron have called on police chiefs to be open about who  they arrest. NCA chief Keith Bristow, who once pledged to be open and transparent, is now vulnerable to accusations of leading the 'secret police' They have both said there should be a ‘working assumption’ in favour of not only confirming arrests, but identifying suspects. Last year Mr Bristow’s former force was criticised after refusing to name a retired police officer charged with stealing £113,000 from its headquarters. Warwickshire Police was forced into a humiliating U-turn amid a national outcry at what some suspected was an attempt to protect their own. Questions also remain over why the explosive allegations against Rock were reported directly to the NCA, and not Scotland Yard. Downing Street officials are in regular contact with a Diplomatic Protection Group sergeant based in Charing Cross who is responsible for their security. The Met has its own child abuse investigation command which has been responsible for thousands of successful inquiries. But Whitehall insiders suggested that senior officials may have lost confidence in the force over the damaging ‘Plebgate’ row which led to the resignation of Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell. One official said the Prime Minister’s closest advisors may have been ‘more comfortable’ dealing with the NCA, whose creation was a Tory manifesto pledge. Asked if police should confirm if an arrest has been made, a College of Policing spokesman replied: ‘Absolutely, that is in the public interest and is in our guidance.’ But an NCA spokesman said it is not ‘appropriate or practical’ to publicise every arrest, and that the agency must balance ‘transparency’ with ‘operational integrity’. ‘We also need to consider the right to a fair trial and the risk of jeopardising a prosecution in the event that charges are brought,’ the spokesman added. ‘An individual who has not been charged, and may still be released without charge, should reasonably expect to have their details made public only when law enforcement has the evidence to bring charges.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Few of the hundreds arrested by National Crime Agency have been named .

A Bank of England employee has been suspended over claims the regulator knew that traders were trying to rig currency exchange rates, it emerged today. The UK's central bank has launched an inquiry into how much officials knew about the alleged manipulation of markets by city traders. It announced today that one member of staff had been suspended from their job pending further investigation. The decision comes after Bank officials examined 15,000 emails, 40 hours of telephone conversations and 21,000 instant messages sent and received by its workers. Probe: The Bank of England has suspended an employee over allegations of exchange rate fixing . The investigation was prompted by a claim from a currency trader that Bank officials had told him that it was OK to share information with rival banks while setting key exchange rate benchmarks. The officials allegedly told him they had no policy on colluding to set rates, and that banks were free to make their own rules. In a statement today, the Bank said: 'It is a matter of public record that the Bank of England has been conducting an internal review into allegations that Bank of England officials condoned or were informed of manipulation in the foreign exchange market or the sharing of confidential client information. 'This extensive review of documents, emails and other records has to date found no evidence that Bank of England staff colluded in any way in manipulating the foreign exchange market or in sharing confidential client information. 'However, the Bank requires its staff to follow rigorous internal control processes and has today suspended a member of staff, pending investigation by the Bank into compliance with those processes.' Traders: Bankers are alleged to have worked together to fix exchange rates of foreign currencies . The statement continued: 'No decision has been taken on disciplinary action against any member of Bank staff. 'The Bank continues to support the Financial Conduct Authority's investigation into the foreign exchange market. In these circumstances, it would not be appropriate for the Bank to make any further comment on this matter.' More than a dozen banks have launched investigations into allegations that their traders deliberately rigged foreign exchange markets to benefit their own trades. The scandal comes in the wake of the international outcry over Libor rigging, which has seen banks pay out billions of pounds in fines after it emerged that daily interest rates were routinely being manipulated. Experts said that it was vital for the Bank of England to prove that none of its staff were involved with the efforts to rig exchange rates. 'Alarm bells should be ringing when a central bank suspends staff in connection with market rigging,' said Simon Morris of law firm CMS. 'While we don't yet know the details, the inference must be that he or she turned a blind eye to market rigging or, even worse, was leaking rate-setting plans to the market.'","Bank has examined 15,000 emails and 21,000 instant messages by workers .

On trial: PR guru Max Clifford  arrives at Southwark Crown Court where he faces charges of indecent assault . Celebrity publicist Max Clifford said today 'all I want is the truth to come out' as he arrived at court for the start of his sexual abuse trial. The PR guru is accused of molesting a string of teenage girls over two decades, with one alleged victim aged 14 at the time. Clifford, 70, is said to have preyed on a total of seven victims, beginning with a teenage girl in 1966. A further six women claim they were targeted between 1975 and 1984. Clifford - whose famous clients include Simon Cowell, Kerry Katona and the late Jade Goody - denies 11 counts of indecent assault. Four charges relate to one victim who was allegedly groped between July 1, 1977 and August 31, 1978. The jury will be selected today before prosecution is due to open its case at Southwark Crown Court, with the trial expected to last up to six weeks. Arriving at the court in a black taxi, accompanied by his lawyer, Clifford patiently posed for the mass of photographers and TV crews. Asked how he was feeling Clifford replied: 'I'm okay. It's (the trial) got to be done. 'It's been 15 months under a very dark cloud for myself and my family and loved ones. 'All I want is for the truth to come out.' Wearing grey trousers, navy blazer, white shirt and blue patterned tie, bespectacled Clifford said his family would be attending the court to support him. Clifford, who vehemently denies the charges, is the second suspect to be tried under Scotland Yard's Operation Yewtree probe, launched in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal in October 2012. The twice-married father-of-one has told how he blames Jimmy Savile for his predicament.

"By . Jason Groves . and Becky Barrow . PUBLISHED: . 20:43 EST, 4 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 04:40 EST, 5 March 2014 . David Cameron risked a row with the Tory Right last night after ignoring calls to help middle-class voters hit by the 40p tax rate. In a major speech on the economy, the Prime Minister promised that further savings from public spending would be used to fund tax cuts. But Mr Cameron, who confirmed the Government would accept a rise in the minimum wage to £6.50 an hour, appeared to indicate that any future tax cuts would be targeted at the low-paid. Ignored: David Cameron, pictured addressing the economy and apprenticeships, did not mention the tax . He made no reference to raising the starting point for paying 40p tax, which is emerging as a key Budget demand among Conservative MPs. Senior Tories are pushing for the tax threshold to be raised from £41,450 to £44,000 to ease the pain on higher earners. Kwasi Kwarteng, a member of the Tory Free Enterprise Group, last night urged the Prime Minister to ensure that any tax cuts are shared by middle-class voters as well as the low-paid. Mr Kwarteng said: ‘We need to do something about the 40p tax rate as well. People on £42,000 cannot be described as wealthy, particularly if they are trying to bring up a family in the South East. We need to help these strivers, who are doing the right thing, to get on. ‘The current threshold sends out a bizarre message. If you earn £42,000 you start paying 40 per cent tax, but you have to earn £35,000 to earn the equivalent of the Government’s benefits cap. That gap is far too narrow.’ In May 2010, the month that the Coalition was formed, a worker became a higher rate taxpayer when their salary hit £43,875. But Chancellor George Osborne has repeatedly lowered, or frozen, the level at which a worker starts to pay tax at 40 per cent. Today you are a higher rate taxpayer if you are paid £41,450. The ‘starting salary’ will barely rise for the next two years, increasing  by just 1 per cent a year to £41,865 in April this year and £42,285 in April 2015, according to the Government’s figures. Traditionally, it would have been increased at a far more generous rate, rising in line with inflation, but the Chancellor scrapped this plan. Accountants Grant Thornton estimate that this so-called ‘fiscal drag’ will see 4.6million people paying 40p tax by the time of next year’s General Election, up from 3million in 2010. Mike Warburton, the firm’s senior tax partner, warned: ‘It is no longer only the rich who are drawn into paying higher rate tax.’ He said recent tax changes have been ‘too harsh on the squeezed middle’, catching people who do not consider themselves well-off, such as teachers, senior nurses and middle managers. Mr Cameron, who has made clear his desire to cut taxes if the Conservatives win power outright in 2015, yesterday said that security came from ‘having more money in our pockets’. But Nick Clegg accused the Prime Minister of having a ‘brass neck’ by posing as a champion of tax cuts. The Deputy Prime Minister claimed that the Tories had initially opposed Coalition plans to raise the starting threshold for paying tax to £10,000. But Mr Cameron also used his speech in Coventry to attack Labour’s economic plans, warning that more borrowing would leave the next generation ‘crippled with our debt’. Not convinced: Nick Clegg accused the prime minister of having a 'brass neck' by posing as a tax cut champion . He also took a swipe at both Labour and church leaders who have criticised the Government’s welfare reforms, saying ministers had a duty to tackle the ‘failure’ of the welfare state that left five million people on out-of-work benefits at the height of the boom in the last decade. ‘I don’t care whether you are the leader of the Labour Party or the leader of the church, this kind of failure is just wrong,’ he said. ‘It’s wrong to let our own people do nothing, with no purpose in their lives, dependent on benefits. ‘It’s wrong to let our own people do nothing, with no purpose in their lives, dependent on benefits. It’s wrong that we open our doors and communities to such rapid levels that they can’t manage. ‘And wrong that we ask British taxpayers to fund this situation with their hard-earned money.’","Conservative leader made no reference to tax cuts for rich in major speech .

Britain could be forced to hand an extra £2.5billion to Brussels to help plug a massive black hole in the EU budget, it emerged last night. In a dramatic admission, EU Budget Commissioner Janusz Lewandowski said Brussels overspent its budget by an astonishing £20billion last year. Mr Lewandowski, who blamed the situation on late invoices, said the cash would be taken from this year’s budget in the short term. But officials conceded it was almost certain to lead to a request for a bailout later this year, making a mockery of claims that the EU budget has been brought under control. Britain faces paying another £2.4billion to plug the latest shortfall in the European Union's spending . A request on this scale would cost . British taxpayers about £2.5billion this year – more than the entire . annual budget of the Foreign Office. The revelation prompted an angry response in Britain, where David Cameron claims he has curbed EU spending. Tory . MEP Marta Andreasen, a member of the European Parliament’s budget . committee, said it was astonishing that the EU was asking for more money . just three months after it was granted an emergency £10billion top-up . to allow it to balance its books. Miss Andreasen, a former chief . accountant at the European Commission, condemned the EU’s ‘utter . incompetence’ and ‘continued disdain with which it treats taxpayers’ money’. She said European . taxpayers ‘should not be throwing more money away on failing policy . areas’, and added: ‘It seems  the European Commission is not only . unwilling but is also completely unable to live within the means agreed. It repeatedly comes back, blaming others and looking for more cash.’ Tory MEP Marta Andreasen (left) said she could not believe her ears when the European Commission's Janusz Lewandowski warned of a new shortfall . Brussels bureaucrats are fighting the introduction of a system to monitor how many hours they actually spend at their desks each week. The claim a proposal forcing European Union officials to clock in and out of the office is ‘unsuitable’ in any ‘dynamic, modern organisation’. Union officials claim that rather than ‘excessive’ checks, working time in the Brussels institutions should instead be based on ‘trust’. Officials are unhappy that their working week has been increased from 37 hours to at least 40 hours in order to extract more value from their generous taxpayer-funded salaries. Tory MEP Syed Kamall said: ‘I really don't think it is some sort of imposition to ask people to establish that they actually work the hours their contract says they do. 'It's what ordinary people do every working day in factories and offices across Europe.""’ Bill . Cash, Tory chairman of the Commons European scrutiny committee, . described the situation as ‘completely unacceptable’, and said Britain . should refuse any demand for more money. He added: ‘They are stretching . the patience of the British taxpayer beyond breaking point. ‘We cannot go on just paying up every time they come back with their begging bowl.’ Pawel . Swidlicki, of the think-tank Open Europe, said it was time Brussels put . its affairs in order rather than demanding even more cash from Britain. He . added: ‘This highlights the shocking lack of long-term planning or . adequate controls in the EU budget. Any shortfall should be made up from . future EU budgets rather than via a fresh top-up from member states. ‘The . budget needs to be radically slimmed down and overhauled – ending the . pointless recycling of regeneration funds among the EU’s richest members . would be a good start.’ The UK Treasury is expected to oppose any extra cash for Brussels, as it did with last year’s demand for £10billion. But . the decision is made by qualified majority voting and Brussels sources . say the UK is likely to be out-voted, as it was last year.","European Commission says it needs £20billion extra from member states .

A teacher has been awarded £230,000 in compensation after slipping on a ketchup sachet while walking down a hallway (file picture) A teacher has been awarded £230,000 after he slipped on a sachet of tomato ketchup in a school corridor. He suffered severe injuries in the fall as he was walking out of the staff room at a secondary school in Essex. The . personal injury claim was settled outside court by council chiefs who . believed they may have been forced to shell out up to £500,000 including . legal fees if the case had gone ahead. Yesterday . it emerged that the payout was one of 34 handed to injured teachers in . the county between 2011 and 2013 – and who received a total of . £1.05million. Critics have . now complained of a ‘compensation culture’ in schools after it was . revealed that other staff had claimed for slipping on wet floors or . being injured by a cupboard door. The . teacher in the ketchup incident was hurt on March 18 2008, but did not . file a claim until March 10 2011 – just eight days before the three-year . legal time limit for making personal injury claims. A . Freedom of Information request revealed that the council agreed a final . settlement of £230,000 in April last year, including £90,000 in damages . for pain, suffering and loss of amenity as well as damages for losses . such as those relating to earnings and pension. The payout also included £120,000 for the teacher’s legal fees and £20,000 in other costs. Other . claims to emerge include a £110,000 settlement to a member of staff who . suffered a spinal injury after slipping on a wet floor on two separate . occasions on the same day. Another employee received £39,450 after . suffering a wrist injury when a faulty metal door swung open when they . were taking plates to a cupboard. Jonathan . Isaby of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘The compensation culture . appears to be more common in the school yard than a grazed knee. 'Wasting . taxpayers’ money on unnecessary payouts leaves less money available for . teaching and higher tax bills for everyone else. The payment was part of more than £1million of compensation payments made to injured teachers by Essex County Council over the past three years (file picture) ‘Legal . costs on top of the actual payouts only add to the overall bill and the . whole process undermines the ability of teachers to actually teach. 'It’s time schools resisted unscrupulous claims before teachers are . unable to leave the staff room for fear of the school being sued.’ However, . Jerry Glazier, the National Union of Teachers representative for Essex, . said there is no compensation culture in schools. He . said: ‘We need to see these claims in context. 'As a union we will . support members who pursue claims for personal injury when we feel they . have been poorly treated by management in schools. ‘Schools are generally very safe environments but employers have a duty of care to protect both teachers and pupils.’ Essex . County Council said it takes ‘health, safety and wellbeing’ seriously, . adding that all compensation claims are investigated and damages paid if . the authority is liable.","Settlement paid by Essex County Council after teacher slipped in hallway .

Elouise Keeling, 14, collapsed with breathing problems during an Air Cadets sports day at RAF Brampton near Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, on June 25 . A schoolgirl cried ‘I’m going to die’ after an ambulance went to the wrong address as she had a fatal asthma attack. Paramedics were called after Elouise Keeling, 14, collapsed with breathing difficulties during an air cadets sports day at an RAF base, but she died after they went to an airfield ten miles away. Her mother Karen Keeling, 33, told an inquest yesterday of the ‘chaos’ as she waited helplessly, and that when ambulance staff did turn up, they just ‘strolled over’. Mrs Keeling had rushed to RAF Brampton, near Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, on June 25 last year after her daughter phoned to say she was unwell. An ambulance was called at 7.44pm but was sent to RAF Wyton and did not arrive until 8.03pm – more than twice the response for high-priority cases. Elouise was pronounced dead an hour later. Mrs Keeling said: ‘She rang me and said, “Mum, my asthma is really bad, you need to come now”. She sounded really panicked. ‘When I got to her, her eyes were open but she was unconscious. When they arrived it was quite chaotic. ‘They seemed slow getting out of the vehicle. They just strolled over. Equipment kept failing – oxygen cylinders kept running out.’ Michael Smith, 19, the cadet who made the 999 call, told how he repeatedly asked the call handler to send the ambulance to RAF Brampton, not Wyton. He said he tried to help Elouise, adding: ‘I was trying to calm her and she was very panicked. She was shouting, “I’m going to die”.’ The inquest at Huntingdon Law Courts heard how Elouise, who had suffered from asthma since she was 18 months old, had not taken part in the sports day but had jogged a short distance. Wing Commander Anthony Kelly, in charge of the Air Cadets, said ambulances had been unable to find the base twice before. The inquest heard that one vehicle got . lost because 'there were too many blue doors' on her street while . another stopped for petrol while answering the 999 call in March. An ambulance was immediately called at 7.44pm but was sent to RAF Wyton, 10 miles away, by mistake. The error meant it did not arrive until 8.03pm . Elouise, who had suffered from asthma since she was 18 months old, died at the scene. Her mother  today told an inquest she rushed to her daughter's side after she had called her saying she felt unwell . In October last year, another inquest heard that Evelyn Heath, 93, from Attleborough, Norfolk, died from an irregular heartbeat in the back of an ambulance after the vehicle took more than four hours to reach her care home. Wing Commander Anthony Kelly, who is . in charge of Air Cadets in Huntingdon, told the inquest at Huntingdon . Law Courts that there had been incidents in 2006 and 2012 when . ambulances had been unable to find the base because of an issue over the . postcode. 'My understanding is that the matters were reported to the ambulance service,' he added. Since Elouise's deaths, both sites have been allocated individual postcodes. The inquest continues. Elouise Keeling collapsed with breathing problems at RAF Brampton near Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire. An ambulance was immediately called at 7.44pm but was sent to RAF Wyton, 10 miles away, by mistake . Delays: Emergency services were called when Elouise had an asthma attack but paramedics did not reach her in time and she died . Lost: Three-month-old Bella Hellings died when paramedics took 26 minutes to reach her after she had a fit and got lost again on the way to hospital . In December, 79-year-old Barry Edwards died after an . ambulance took two-and-a-half hours to arrive. Mr Edwards only lived . just over a mile from Addenbrooke Hospital, Cambridge, where he was . eventually treated, but it was only after  three calls to 999 that an . ambulance was sent from 83 miles away in Great Yarmouth to take him to . hospital. He died the next morning. In January an . unannounced inspection by the Care Quality Commission warned the East of . England Ambulance Service Trust to improve its care of patients after . receiving several complaints from people who had waited up to three . hours for an ambulance to take them to hospital. Later . that month, police officers complained that they were having to take . patients to hospital 'on a daily basis' because no EEAST ambulances were . available, and were regularly having to wait 'an inordinate amount of . time' for their paramedic colleagues to arrive at the scene of an . emergency. A week later, firefighters warned that . something was 'going seriously wrong with the 999 response' of the . EEAST. They said they were waiting 'longer and longer' for ambulances to . arrive and found paramedics often arrived alone on motorbikes or cars . and were unable to transport patients to hospital. Keith Handscomb, of . East Anglia FBU, said: 'Fire officers tell us of their desperate . frustration at being told to . wait in line when chasing up emergency requests for the attendance of an . ambulance. Sometimes they are told the ambulance sent to their . emergency has been . redirected to another call due to there being no other ambulance . available.' In March, three-month-old Bella Hellings died . after she suffered a fit and the ambulance that was supposed to be . taking her to hospital got lost twice. The driver had been relying on a . satnav and took 26 minutes to reach her at home in Bury St Edmunds, more . than three times the target time of eight minutes. They got lost again . on the way to hospital, where Bella was pronounced dead.

Kris Bradley wept as he was found guilty of attempted murder following a hammer attack on Matthew Probert in Lincoln . A man who smashed a promising rugby player’s skull with a claw hammer so hard that bone splinters embedded into his brain wept as he was found guilty of attempted murder today. Matthew Probert, 21, was left with 'life-changing' injuries after he was attacked by Kris Bradley, 23, after he accidentally bumped into him in a bar. Mr Probert was on a night out at the Walkabout bar in Lincoln with team mates from Scunthorpe Rugby Club celebrating a friend’s 21st birthday when he was set upon by Bradley. Pictures taken by bystanders show a dazed Mr Probert slumped on the ground with . the hammer  embedded in his forehead following the brutal attack on August . 31 last year. He later told court he had no idea he had the tool stuck in his head until he was in the ambulance - when he tried to wrench it out of his skull himself. Bradley sobbed uncontrollably as he was found guilty of attempted murder following a five-day trial at Birmingham Crown Court. Bradley’s friend Daniel Burrell, 22, who supplied him with the hammer was found guilty of assisting an offender. The jury of eight men and four women returned a majority verdict after four-and-a-half hours of deliberations. A third man, Alex Taylor, 21, who was with Bradley when he attacked Mr Probert, admitted assisting an offender at an earlier hearing. The court had heard that Bradley and Taylor decided to set upon Mr Probert after a row erupted in the Walkabout bar in Lincoln city centre. The three men were booted out of the pub and continued arguing in the street before Mr Probert walked away. Bradley and Taylor then planned to 'mete out revenge' and stalked him through the streets until they corned him in an alleyway. Matthew Probert, 21, was hit with such force with the claw hammer, splinters of bone became embedded inside his brain . The court heard Bradley called Burrell and told him to bring him a hammer which he used to batter the young rugby player. Prosecutor Gordon Aspden told the jury: 'They wanted to mete out revenge. 'Kris . Bradley called Daniel Burrell and asked him for help. Daniel Burrell . drove into the city and brought with him a claw hammer. 'On arrival Kris Bradley collected that claw hammer from Burrell’s Vauxhall Corsa and hid it in the waist band of his trousers. 'While Daniel Burrell waited they then set out to find Matthew Probert with the hammer. 'They eventually found him, alone, walking in a side street. Bradley’s friend Daniel Burrell, 22,  (left) who supplied him with the hammer was found guilty of assisting an offender. Alex Taylor, 21,  (right) admitted assisting an offender at an earlier hearing . 'Kris . Bradley approached him from behind, followed by Alex Taylor, he took . the hammer out of the waistband of his trousers and struck Mr Probert . with it on the head. 'The . force of the blow penetrated into his skull. The two claws went through . the left side of his forehead, through his skull and into his brain. 'Matthew Probert was taken completely by surprise. He collapsed on the pavement with the hammer left inside his skull. 'Job done, Kris Bradley ran back to Daniel Burrell’s car followed by Alex Taylor.' Rugby player Matthew Probert was left with life-changing injuries, the court heard . Bradley was caught when he ran into a car and left a hand print on the bonnet. Police used the print to identify him using the national database. The . court heard Bradley and Burrell sent callous text messages to each . other just hours after the brutal attack, joking about getting . 'hammered' and having a 'smashing time'. Yesterday Bradley was remanded into custody and warned he faced a long prison sentence when he returns to court on March 31. Judge . Melbourne Inman QC said: 'Obviously whilst a prison sentence is . inevitable, it seems to me the dangerousness (of Bradley) needs to be . considered. 'This is now the fourth time you have been involved in violence and no doubt being drunk in public. 'A long custodial sentence is obviously inevitable, until then you will be remanded in custody.' Burrell and Taylor were bailed and ordered to return to court on the same day for sentencing. Mr . Probert was taken to Lincoln City Hospital before being transferred to a . neurosurgery unit at Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, with the . hammer still embedded in his skull. He . told the court he was so stunned by the ferocity of the attack he only . realised what had happened when he was in the ambulance and he tried to . wrench out the hammer by hand. In a statement read to the court, he said: 'I remember being served a drink at Walkabout, but nothing more. 'My . next memory is the handle of something sticking out of my head in the . ambulance. I tried to reach and take it out but the paramedic stopped . me. 'It was only in the hospital that a nurse told me it was a hammer.' Mr Probert, who did not attend the trial, was yesterday said to be 'delighted' with the verdict. His girlfriend Elisha Davis, 21, of Scunthorpe, said: 'Obviously we are delighted with the verdict. 'The last few months have been very difficult for Matthew but he is now in a position to be able to start to put it behind him.'

His . father Mark Probert, 48, said: 'We are pleased with the outcome of the . investigation into the horrific assault on my son Matthew, he could died . and even now he is struggling to come to terms with what happened to . him on the night in question.

Investigating officer Detective Sergeant Cunningham, of Lincolnshire Police, said: 'We are very pleased with these convictions.

Investment banker Timothy Brooks stole nearly £600,000 from wealthy clients to fund his gambling . An investment banker who stole nearly £600,000 from wealthy clients to fund his gambling habit has been jailed for two years. Timothy Brooks, 42, who was employed at the Mayfair Private Banking Service division of Lloyds TSB Banking Group, plundered money from the private banking accounts of customers over a six-year period. The married father-of-three pleaded guilty at Manchester Crown Court to 17 counts of fraud, with withdrawals totalling £573,736 diverted to bank accounts he set up in the names of his children. He revealed that he had deliberately . chosen customers with the biggest portfolios who were least likely to . notice thousands going missing. The . money was stolen in 57 separate transactions - but went unnoticed until . a processing error led to one of the payments being looked at more . closely last July. The . matter was reported to police last summer after Brooks’ colleagues at . the Manchester private banking division discovered he had transferred . money from the accounts of 17 customers since September 2007. Officers . from Greater Manchester Police’s economic crime unit went on to search . Brooks’ home in Prestwich. Mark . Ford, defending Brooks in court, said that at the time of the thefts . Brooks was in the 'vice-like' grip of a gambling addiction. Huge sums were spent on casino tables and online sports betting with companies including Grosvenor Casinos. The charges relate to 17 separate accounts, including portfolios held by married couples. One of the victims had befriended Brooks at social events held by the bank, and two others died before the case got to court. Brooks began working for the bank in 1990, and was earning £34,000 as an assistant to a customer relationship manager at the time of his arrest. Brooks was employed at the Mayfair Private Banking Service division of Lloyds TSB Banking Group, based at Spring Gardens in Manchester . Charlotte Crangle, prosecuting, told the court that Brooks passed off the payments as account charges, copying colleagues' electronic signatures to make them look as if they had been signed off. The customer who suffered the highest loss had £94,988 stolen between May 2010 and April last year, with payments of up to £15,000 taken in consecutive months. Brooks was also 'robbing Peter to pay Paul', Miss Crangle said, transferring money between customer accounts to disguise his theft. Miss Crangle told court that customers - who have been reimbursed by the bank - felt 'shock and annoyance' at what had gone on. Mr Ford said Brooks was 'deeply sorry' for his crime, but argued the sentence should reflect that no individuals had 'borne the loss'. Describing how a man known as 'kind, decent and fundamentally honest', came to be in this 'dreadful position', Mr Ford said he had a severe addiction, which 'exerts a vice-like grip and feeds on itself, destroying everything'. Miss Recorder Goode, sentencing, told Brooks his crimes were a 'gross breach of trust', adding: 'It's tragic to see a man such as yourself before the court.' The married father-of-three pleaded guilty to 17 counts of fraud at Manchester Crown Court . Following sentencing, detective constable Beth Colbourne said: ‘Brooks completely abused his position and the trust that was placed upon him by both his employers and his clients to steal more than half a million pounds from the accounts of his customers. ‘However, Brooks’ deceit was uncovered by his colleagues and the police were brought in to investigate him and today he has rightly been put behind bars.’ She added: ‘Brooks thought he could get away with his illegal activities, but he was wrong. Let this serve as a warning that any fraudulent activity will always be uncovered in the end, and you will be made to pay for your actions, ruining not only your life and causing distress to all those that you have stolen from, but devastating the lives of your family too.’ Susan Taylor, senior crown prosecutor for CPS North West, said: ‘Timothy Brooks held a position of trust at Lloyds Bank. He was responsible for managing millions of pounds of investors’ money. ‘However, over a six-year period he abused the trust of the bank and the investors by re-directing funds into the bank accounts of his children, which he then used to fund his gambling habits. ‘We are pleased that Brooks has now taken responsibility for his dishonest actions. This case is an example to others who think that committing fraud to gain large amounts of money is an easy option; they are not above the law and will be brought before the courts.’","Timothy Brooks, 42, who was employed at the Mayfair Private Banking Service, part of Lloyds TSB, plundered money over a six-year period .

This is the face of the mystery man at the centre of a murder probe after his naked body was washed up on a popular beach. The bearded stranger was found wearing just his socks and a single walking shoe when he was discovered last Tuesday at Perranporth in Cornwall. It was initially thought the man may have killed himself but Devon and Cornwall Police say he had multiple suspicious injuries. Anonymous: This is an artist's impression of the mystery man at the centre of a murder probe after his naked body was washed up on a popular Cornwall beach .

A series of mysterious items were also found near the corpse, including a dark navy blue Regatta coat and a wallet containing a faded picture of a child. Police also found a set of keys consisting of a Citroen car key, two mortice lock keys, a hippopotamus key-ring and a red fob. A date on the back of the picture reads 13 April 1952, but it is unclear what this refers to. Officers also found a woolly hat and a rucksack. Detectives now hope this black and white artist's impression will lead to an identification for the man who was white, aged 50-70, of thin build and between 5ft 5ins and 5ft 7ins tall. He had white receding hair, which was bald on top, and a thick white bushy beard. Perranporth residents have likened his discovery to the ITV hit crime drama 'Broadchurch' and say their pretty coastal town is awash with sinister rumours.

Shuhel Mahboob Ali told the 'father' online that he wanted to have sex with her and raise a 'daughters-only' family so that he could carry out a sick incest fantasy. Ali believed that the agent was arranging for him to be set up with his daughter, and Ali told how he wanted to 'settle down with a girl and raise a couple of daughters for ""the lifestyle,""' according to the criminal complaint. Sentenced: Shuhel Mahboob Ali has been sentenced to spend 10 years in a federal prison for his plot to create and sexually abuse an 'incest family' From January to April 2013, Ali communicated with the undercover agent online and described in harrowing detail how he would abuse their fictitious children. He said that 'once the mid-wife left' he would begin to sexually assault their daughter. 'When you start with very, very, very young, you can mold them to believe anything and do anything you see,' he said according to the criminal complaint obtained by the Orlando Sentinel. He planned to travel to Florida, meet the teen and then bring her back to the United Kingdom where he would 'begin to train her sexually and prepare her for a family'. 'Predator': Ali, now 39, was arrested when he arrived in Florida after plotting out his sick fantasy for months . Ali flew from London to Sanford, Florida in April and then met the agent when he was expecting to meet the father of his would-be bride. He was arrested near Titusville by agents from the Department of Homeland Security and local sheriff's deputies. He was then taken into custody in North Brevard County. Police found bondage tape, two hooded face masks, condoms and cameras in his bag as well as a computer which contained child pornography. Ali pleaded guilty to enticing a minor to engage in sexual activity. His 10 year sentence, which will be spent in a federal prison, was handed down on Monday. 'It is truly unimaginable that monsters exist and walk among us with the purpose of victimizing our most precious citizens,' Sheriff Wayne Ivey said at the time of his arrest.

Aziz, 59, once blew £500,000 in one night gambling in the capital and . would often take her entourage to swanky casinos in London, Singapore, . and Macau, the court heard. Lim had also . been accused of stealing a diamond bracelet belonging to Ms Aziz, worth . around £3.3m and bought from Graff jewellers in Bond Street. But a jury at Isleworth Crown Court took nearly 15 hours to find Lim not guilty of three counts of theft. The Sultan of Brunei's ex-wife Mariam Aziz admitted previously selling jewellery worth £1m to pay off gambling debts . Lim . had been tempted into a gambling lifestyle by Ms Aziz after she . persuaded her team of female Muslim bodyguards to play the tables, . despite their faith. Jurors heard that the Bruneian royal would each provide them with gambling chips worth up to £3,000 a time. Lim’s . gambling credit was eventually increased from £3,000 to £1.5m because . of her association with Ms Aziz, the court was told. She . told jurors she had to sell the diamonds in secret because Ms Aziz did . not want the Sultan’s family to know of her crazed gambling sprees. Lim, . from Singapore, said: ‘I was in the casino car, the chauffeur driven . car given by casinos to assist Ms Aziz to travel to and from the . casinos. ‘At that time I was sitting in the back with Ms Aziz, she said she wanted to sell jewellery. ‘I looked at her and she took out two bracelets and she said that she wanted me to sell them for her’. She continued: ‘At that time she was . owing to casinos £800,000. She told me that I could find any buyer that . was sufficient to pay her gambling debts. ‘I . agreed to it because the jewellery belongs to Ms Aziz and she has the . right to sell whatever she wanted so I just did whatever I was . instructed. ‘Ms Aziz said I . couldn’t say it belonged to her. I asked who I can say these items . belong to and she says ""say it belongs to your mother”. Lim . had the real diamonds replicated by a jeweller in London’s famous . Hatton Garden after providing him with a forged letter stating they were . a gift from Ms Aziz to her mother, for 28 years of service as her PA. The . gems were eventually sold to a buyer in Switzerland for close to £5m - . around the same sum as Lim claimed her then boss owed to London casinos. She was confronted for the thefts by Ms Aziz’s nephew Idris Ja’afar in Brunei where she was arrested on January 3, 2010. Just . hours after the badminton star had been released on bail by local . detectives Mr Ja’afar secretly recorded his meeting with Lim - in which . she made a full confession. But . Lim told jurors that she had been forced into a false confession by . corrupt detectives and made a ‘scapegoat’ by the Bruneian Royal Family.","Fatimah Lim was accused of stealing two gems and a bracelet worth £12m .

"By . Mia De Graaf . PUBLISHED: . 18:34 EST, 4 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 02:33 EST, 5 March 2014 . Pleaded: John Jenkin, 24, today pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Alice McMeekin and Katie Jenkin . A man axed to death his mother and sister just two days after he was taken to a mental health unit following a suicide attempt, a court heard today. John Jenkin, 24, took a cocktail of LSD, whisky and painkillers then tried to drown himself in a river and slash his wrists, before passers-by called 999. Following a 90-minute examination by a psychiatric nurse at Furness General Hospital, Cumbria, he was released and went on to kill Alice McMeekin, 58, and Katie Jenkin, 20, at their family home. Today he pleaded guilty to two counts of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. He denied their murders. Preston Crown Court heard that psychiatric experts agreed Jenkin was suffering from a schizophrenic disorder at the time of the offences in Millom on June 8 last year. Sentencing was adjourned until Thursday to hear medical evidence and decide whether he should be subject to a hospital order or a custodial term. Anthony Cross QC, prosecuting, said the defendant had made an attempt on his life on June 6. 'He did so by taking 15 Co-codamol tablets, a significant amount of whisky and he took two tablets of LSD,' said the barrister. 'Having taken that combination of intoxicants he went to the banks of a river in Millom and tried to drown himself.' That bid was unsuccessful and once back on shore he then attempted to slash his wrists, said Mr Cross. He was seen by two witnesses and was later taken to the Dane Garth Mental Health Unit, attached to Furness General. Mr Cross said: 'He was described as . having a medium risk of both grandiosity and worthlessness, and a medium . risk of a detrimental affect of drug misuse. 'But no other mental health problems are noted or recorded.' Katie Jenkin (right) was found dead at her family home in Millom, Cumbria, on June 8 . Psychiatric experts for defence and prosecution agreed Jenkin was suffering schizophrenic disorder that day . After killing his mother and sister on the morning of June 8, Jenkin was arrested in 'rather bizarre circumstances' at the scene of the suicide bid, the court was told. He was found naked by police and had engaged in 'extremely bizarre behaviour'. Mr Cross said the Crown had found no evidence to indicate that the killings were carried out while he was immediately affected or intoxicated with illicit substances. But he invited the judge, Mr Justice King, to consider whether the use of drugs taken in the preceding days had aggravated the offences. Mr Justice King said the matter 'was and is a grave case' whereby the defendant took an axe and 'on any view brutally killed the two victims'. Jenkin is being treated at maximum-security Ashworth Hospital in Merseyside.

But this historic collection of rum has become the most expensive in history, after fetching £80,000 at auction. The rare 18th century spirit was discovered in the basement of Harewood House in Leeds while staff performed an inventory. The bottles date back to around 1780 and were valued at £600-£800 per bottle . Harrogate Fine Wine Company then sold the alcohol at an auction hosted by Christie's in London. Mark Lascelles, brother of the eighth Earl of Harewood, who owns the Grade II listed country house in Yorkshire said: 'I had always known the bottles were down there but I wouldn’t have given them another look. 'But when my late father asked us to do an inventory we thought we might take one and test it out, even though the mould was pretty unsavoury. 'They were obviously pretty old, as they had clearly been hand blown. Harrogate Fine Wine Company sold the pricey tipple at Christie's Fine and Rare Wines sale in London, fetching a sum of £78,255 . 'We brought a bottle back to the shop and it took maybe half an hour to get the mould off, and then another half an hour to get the cork out.' The bottles date back to around 1780 and were valued at £600-£800 per bottle - but they were sold for more than six times the pre-sale estimate, fetching as much as £8,225 each. David Elswood, International Director of Christie’s Wine in Europe and Asia said: 'We are thrilled with the results for the sale of The 1780 Harewood Rum. 'The twelve bottles of dark and light rum sold for a total of £78,255, making it both the oldest and most valuable Rum ever sold at auction by Christie’s.' All of the proceeds from the sale went to the Geraldine Connor Foundation - a charity that helps young people in performing arts that has strong links with Harewood House. Co-director of the foundation Shiela Haworth said: 'This money will be a stepping stone encouraging us to start this year’s summer school, meaning young people can get involved straight away. 'Young people are lost in the summer holidays, but for six long weeks they can work with professionals and at the end of it they have themselves a performance.' Andy Langshaw, who also owns the house, said: 'The idea had always been to raise money for some kind of British Caribbean charity or foundation, and we have succeeded spectacularly at that. 'It is a once in a lifetime discovery for someone in the wine trade and it has been a privilege to be involved.' Mr Lascelles added that the discovery of the rum made perfect sense, given the links between Harewood House and the Caribbean - some of the rum has now been returned to Barbados. Trade: The owners of the Grade II country house said the rum may have been there as a result of the estate's historic links to the Caribbean . Discovery: Staff at the Yorkshire country house found the bottles while performing an inventory. Each bottle was initially valued at £800, but some sold for six times their pre-sale estimate . Royal drink: Princess Anne (pictured in the white sun hat in 1969) had a 'tot' of Navy rum aboard the HMS Fox . The first stage of the rum-making process is to cultivated and harvest sugar cane by hand. Historically, it came from Papua New Guinea, but now plantations can be found all over the world, with many based in the Caribbean. The cut cane is transported to a mill where it is crushed by a machine. After being cooked it is fermented, in an open vat or in labratory conditions, and is then distilled in a heated container. Some rums are simply bottled fresh from the still. However most types of are kept heated for longer and some are infused with herbs and spices. Most of the spirit is then diluted with water - at some point prior to bottling - which gives it around a 50 per cent alcohol volume. It was in the West Indies that the rum became a popular drink with members of the British Navy. Explorers who had gone to the Caribbean to make money out of metal, found it was more lucrative to deal in sugar. This meant thousands of sugar works were set up around the islands and nearly every plantation employed a copper pot still to make alcohol from the fermented skimmings and molasses. In 1655 Admiral Penn of the British fleet captured Jamaica from the Spanish. While celebrating his victory, he authorised that rum should to replace the official beer ration. When he sailed from Jamaica he found that the rum had the natural advantage of remaining sweet in the cask for much longer than water or beer. For the next 300 years, sailors were issued a daily 'tot' of the sugar-cane drink. The spirit would also be sold to sailors to bring in extra revenue but more importantly, it attracted a naval presence that deterred pirates lurking in the area. But in 1740, Admiral Edward Vernon claimed, ‘the vice of drunkenness is but too visibly increasing in our mariners’ and he reduced the ration by a quart (just over a litre) of water to every half pint of rum. The drunkenness was cured by drinking of tea and cocoa on ships. However, it was still a threat to naval efficiency so in 1850 the rum ration was fixed at an eighth of a pint, until it was abolished in 1970. The last Navy issue took place on 31 July 1970 known as ‘Black Tot Day’.","Bottles were discovered while staff performed inventory of country house .

Nile Ranger leaves court after a jury found him not guilty of raping a woman. After the foreman delivered the not guilty verdict Ranger banged on the sides of the dock and said 'Thank God for that' The 22-year-old denied the accusation and said they had consensual sex after going out drinking together. He . told Newcastle Crown Court he had never engaged in sexual activity with . a woman against her will and the jury returned the not guilty verdict . after the week-long trial. Ranger and the woman had met in a city centre bar and gone on to different clubs before eventually booking into the Carlton Hotel, in Jesmond, Newcastle. Giving evidence, the woman said that she had no memory of the night after the first bar they were in until she woke up naked next to Ranger in bed. Ranger told her she should take the morning after pill. She left and they continued to swap messages that day, the court heard. She then visited her GP, was checked at hospital and made a rape allegation to police. Former Newcastle United striker Nile Ranger (pictured arriving at court today) has been cleared of raping a woman in a hotel . Ranger told Newcastle Crown Court he had never engaged in sexual activity with a woman against her will and the jury returned the not guilty verdict after the week-long trial . But after being arrested Ranger, now . playing for Swindon Town, told the police they had had sex more than . once and that she had engaged 'whole heartedly' and 'enthusiastically'. The court heard that the pair had been messaging for a year before the incident, with Ranger often trying to meet up with her. This had led the student to refer to him as a 'predator' and 'Nile Ripper' in some texts they exchanged. Dismissing the jury, Judge Evans thanked them for their consideration. Nile Ranger pictured outside court in April last year . A formidable talent on the pitch has given Nile Ranger opportunities most youngsters can only dream of. But the striker, who represented his country at the Under-19 level, has had his promising future hampered by a string of brushes with the law. Ranger previously has spoken of how he got embroiled in gang culture while growing up in London. He served an 11-week sentence in a young offenders institution when he was 15 after he took part in an armed street robbery. But despite saying 'I never want to go back', the striker found himself again facing charges in 2011, after a 33-year-old man was found outside a Newcastle pub with a broken jaw. In October 2012 he was finally cleared of two counts of actual bodily harm relating to the incident, after a court heard his actions were in self defence and he had been the victim of racist taunts. But he was also handed a 12-month conditional discharge after admitting assaulting two police officers who were trying to arrest him in connection with the fight. But before that case was even resolved, Ranger was given a six-month conditional discharge after admitting a charge of being drunk and disorderly, and sentenced to 120 hours community service after admitting pulling his then-girlfriend's hair during a row. In the meantime, he was also rapped by the FA and his then club, Newcastle United, for posing with a replica gun in a photograph that was subsequently published in The Sun and making homophobic remarks on Twitter. He also drew ire from some Newcastle fans after posting a picture on Instagram, spelling out his name in £20 notes. Ranger made no comment leaving the court but his solicitor, Geoffrey Forrester, said he was delighted with the result. 'It took the jury approximately one hour, after hearing evidence extending over seven days, to find him not guilty,' he said. 'He's obviously delighted with the result and wants to get back to doing what he does, playing football, and he just wants to get on with his life.' During the trial the jury heard about trouble that Ranger had been in previously. This included serving an 11-week sentence in a young offenders' institution when he was just 15 after he took part in a street robbery. Growing up in North London, he mixed with an older gang, and also had convictions for burglary and handling stolen goods back in 2007.","Former Newcastle United striker Nile Ranger, 22, cleared of raping woman .

Cardiff City are unlikely to face any action from the Premier League despite owner Vincent Tan offering his players an illegal £3.7million bonus before Sunday’s defeat by Tottenham. The Premier League contacted the Welsh club on Tuesday after Sportsmail revealed Tan broke top-flight rules, which state every team must lodge their bonus schedule before the start of the season. The Malaysian billionaire addressed the players at their Hilton Hotel on London’s Park Lane on Saturday evening and offered the group the bonus to share in the event that they avoid relegation.

Under scrutiny: Cardiff City owner Vincent Tan made an illegal offer to players . More misery: Roberto Soldado's goal consigned Cardiff to another defeat on Sunday . However, Sportsmail understands the club are likely avoid a sanction because Tan retracted the offer once he was made aware that it went against the rules. Under the rules, every club has until the start of the season to register any bonuses not mentioned in players’ contracts with the Premier League to protect the integrity of the game at the highest level. The regulation is designed to stop clubs using money to motivate players and other staff outside of their existing agreements. Clubs were given a month’s grace this year because of the new TV deals. Dejected: Cardiff's players look gutted after Soldado scores for Spurs . Cardiff chairman Mehmet Dalman said: ‘This has all been taken out of context and is a misunderstanding. ‘Yes, Vincent did make the offer on Saturday but he has no executive powers. He's just the owner. He's not running the club and it wasn't up to him to make this offer. ‘I've told him there are strict rules about bonuses and we'd talk further about implementing with the payment structure for next season. Please bear in mind, Vincent Tan meant well on this occasion.’ In the unlikely event that the Premier League do choose to take action, they have a number of options available to them if they  find Tan guilty of an offence, including a fine. If the matter is deemed serious enough, it can be taken to an independent regulatory commission, where the sanctions - including fines and points deductions - are almost unlimited.

The Prime Minister will say that fracking will attract firms to move posts back to the UK and make Britain the ¿re-shore nation¿ . Cheap energy from shale gas will help fuel a trend that is seeking thousands of British jobs shifted to low-cost countries in the East brought back home, David Cameron will declare today. The Prime Minister will say that fracking, coupled with cuts to business taxes and red tape, will attract firms to move posts back to the UK and make Britain the ‘re-shore nation’. According to Government figures, some 1,500 manufacturing jobs have already come back to the UK since 2011, while major companies are also reopening call centres previously shifted to countries such as India and the Philippines. Experts say various factors are driving the trend, including companies wanting to improve quality, shorten lead time and improve delivery performance. As middle classes expand and wages rise in emerging economies such as China, there is also a narrowing advantage in terms of costs. Speaking to the World Economic Forum in Swiss ski resort Davos, the Prime Minister will acknowledge that companies are certain to continue moving production facilities to countries like India and China in the years to come, but he will insist that the West should not be ‘written off’. Citing recent research which found that one in ten small and medium-sized businesses have brought production back to the UK over the last year - twice as many as have sent it abroad - he will say that reshoring could become ‘a fresh driver of growth in Europe’ and Britain should take advantage of the trend. ‘For years the West has been written off,’ Mr Cameron is expected to say. ‘People say that we are facing some sort of inevitable decline. They say we can’t make anything any more. ‘Whether it’s the shift from manufacturing to services or the transfer from manual jobs to machines, the end point is the same dystopian vision - the East wins while the West loses; and the workers lose while the machines win. ‘I don’t believe it has to be this way. ‘Of course, we cannot be starry eyed about globalisation - it presents huge challenges as our economies and societies try to adapt. But neither should we take this pessimistic view. The Prime Minister will suggest that governments can encourage the trend by acting to ensure supplies of cheap energy . ‘Indeed if we make the right decisions, we may also see more of what has been a small but discernible trend where some jobs that were once offshored are coming back from East to West.’ The Prime Minister will suggest that governments can encourage the trend by acting to ensure supplies of cheap energy. Business Secretary Vince Cable said: ¿British industry is coming home' ‘There is no doubt that when it comes to re-shoring in the US, one of the most important factors has been the development of shale gas which is flooring US energy prices with billions of dollars of energy cost savings predicted over the next decade,’ he is expected to say. ‘Taken together, I believe these trends have the ability to be a fresh driver of growth in Europe too. I want Britain to seize these opportunities. I think there is a chance for Britain to become the ‘re-shore nation’.’ Before flying out to Davos, Mr Cameron visited ventilation and heating equipment manufacturers Vent-Axia, which has recently moved production from China to Crawley, in West Sussex. Other companies which have brought jobs back to the UK include food manufacturer Symington’s, which is moving its factory from China to Leeds, model train firm Hornby, which is shifting some manufacturing from India to Britain, computer company Raspberry Pi, which has moved production to Wales, and fashion brand Jaeger which is bringing as much as 10% of its manufacturing back to Britain after a 15-year absence, said Downing Street. Business Secretary Vince Cable said: ‘British industry is coming home. 'Over the last few months I have welcomed many companies who have taken manufacturing, textiles, call centre work or software abroad, bringing jobs back to the UK. 'This is a sign that diverse, high-quality British manufacturing is on the rise once again. ‘It also highlights the ability of British-based business to stand strong in the face of global competition.’ Labour’s shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said: ‘David Cameron and George Osborne have failed to deliver the stronger, balanced recovery we need to see. ‘The Tory-led government came to office promising an export-led recovery but the UK’s trade deficit is growing. Any help for manufacturers is welcome after three damaging years of flatlining and in a month where factory orders have fallen back. 'But after so many Government schemes have failed to deliver for business, manufacturers will want to see what this one offers in practice. ‘Labour would create a proper British Investment Bank supported by a network of regional banks, a skills system which delivers for businesses of all sizes and would cut business rates to help growing firms.’","The Prime Minister will say that fracking will attract firms to move posts back to the UK and make Britain the ‘re-shore nation’

First, there was the Undateables, the Channel 4 show that helped people living with disabilities to find love and gave the nation a glimpse of the difficulties they face. Now a new dating show, Man Up, aims to do the same for men who lack the confidence to speak to women, whether because of cultural reasons, a fear of rejection or simply because they just don't know where to start. One man who's no stranger to all three is Atul Rana, 36, who has been single all his life, barring a brief relationship when he was a student. Looking for love: Atul Rana, 36, says he would like to fall in love but admits that he isn't sure how to get started . 'It's 90 per cent due to cultural conditioning because I was brought up in the Indian system until I was 15,' he explains. 'My parents were in an arranged marriage and I was brought up to expect one too.' His life changed dramatically when his parents, both diplomats, returned home to India leaving him behind to attend university in Newcastle. 'The cultural adjustment from conservative Indian to liberal Western is huge,' he admits. 'I like the idea of falling in love but despite all my attempts, I don't actually know what to do.' Both nervous of rejection and worried about the impact a love-match might have on his conservative family, Atul says matters are made worse by his lack of experience - both in and out of bed. '[Being a virgin] is one of the things that worries me the most,' he admits. 'It's a . sensitive topic and quite hard for me to talk about. Support: Atul lives with and provides for his mother and sister who moved in after his father's death . Help: Atul with Anjula Mutanda, Man Up's resident psychologist who helped him face down his concerns . Take Me Out (ITV) ITV's flagship dating show lets men do their best to impress the assembled panel of women in a bid to win a date on the legendary Isle of Fernandos (really Puerto de la Cruz in Tenerife). Although most of the more embarrassing parts fall to the men, they are at least guaranteed a date - unlike the women who remain on the panel until they're 'chosen'. Not great for dating advice but very entertaining. Snog Marry Avoid (BBC3) The cult BBC show focuses on the physical side of romance; transforming bizarrely dressed boys and girls into natural beauties. Brilliant if you need help with dressing for dates, highlights include the punk with pink hair who turned out to be a Jennifer Lawrence lookalike and 'Scotland's No. 1 Male Barbie' who was a rather handsome chap underneath the make-up. The Undateables (Channel 4) An utterly heartwarming foray into the world of dating for the disabled. Whether they have Asperger's, dwarfism or Tourette's Syndrome, participants are helped to find a partner who won't be put off by their differences. The best part? When the men and women featured finally realise that they aren't undateable after all. 'In . India, it was the norm and the honourable thing to do. Here it's . something to be ashamed of. It's like you're not complete as a man. People make fun of you.' Since filming the show, which, along with style and dating advice, gives participants the chance to talk through their problems, Atul has been on four dates but is yet to find the right person for him. 'I used to find dating nerve wracking and I still do,' he admits. 'There's the unfamiliarity about what's going to happen.' His Indian upbringing has also had an impact because, as Atul explains, expectations are very different. 'In India, when you meet a girl, you're going to marry her so a first date is very serious. When I came here, I felt it distracted me from reality that it's a numbers game - some people you get on well with, and others you don't. What the show made me realise is that it is just a first date - it's no big deal and it's not going to lead to anything unless you like each other.' He has also finally plucked up the courage to tell his mother that he doesn't want an arranged marriage, despite pressure from the rest of his family. 'My father died seven-and-a-half years ago,' he explains. 'When I went to India for the funeral, I found out that my dad had been setting me up to get married to a girl there. 'It was hard because I was devastated about his death but my extended family were there saying that it was his last wish and that I should do it. Since then, my mother has set up other girls as well. He adds: 'I would love to marry eventually but I want it to be for love - not because it was arranged. 'When I told her, my mother was disappointed but she accepted it. Deep in her heart she knew that I had become so Westernised that it would happen anyway.' Now with what Atul describes as a '100 per cent block' removed, he's hoping his new-found confidence will give him the courage to find the girl of his dreams. 'I have to meet a few more girls to find out exactly what I . like in a girl,' he smiles, adding: 'But from the four girls I've met, I think someone who is quite . intelligent would be good. Help is at hand: The team behind Man Up aim to give under-confident men the self-esteem boost they need . Ringing the changes: Atul hopes that his appearance on Man Up will help him overcome his difficulties . 'At least someone of reasonable intelligence and with a bit . of arty flair, because I'm a musician. Pretty too obviously!' And what does he have to give in return? 'I'm . quite intelligent, very ambitious, very persistent and brave,' he muses. 'Doing . this [the TV show] isn't easy. And I'm a very open minded and happy person.' He's also got some advice for other men in his situation, suggesting that they too are honest with their families about their wish to date women who aren't a part of their culture. 'I would say tell your family you want to . date someone outside your culture and be very honest with them,' he advises. 'If you . feel ashamed about it, any girl you try to date or chat to will sense it . and it's going to limit you severely. Just don't be ashamed of it.' He hopes too, that people will become a little more understanding of the challenges faced by those adapting to dating across the cultural divide. 'I . hope the people who watch will respect me for being brave about [dating] and I think they . will get a real, real deep understanding of how much of a challenge it . is for people to make a 180 degree turn from their culture. 'British . values are very liberal and it's difficult to adapt.' He adds: 'I feel like a teenager and am starting . completely from the beginning. 'I just want to go slowly and do things on my own terms and so that will take a while. Before I . wouldn't ask for a date because I was scared of getting rejected and I still do get rejected but I'm learning to pick myself up and get on . with it.'

The operation, which took 18 hours, was designed to allow surgeons to remove a huge tumour from Mr McGregor’s thigh and then to give them some tissue to cover the wound with. Ian McGregor, 59, was saved from cancer after surgeons removed part of his leg and attached it to his arm . Mr McGregor (pictured with wife Janis) became the first person to have experimental tumour removal surgery. He was treated at Newcastle's Freeman Hospital . Mr McGregor, from Sunderland, had a large and aggressive tumour in the top of his leg, the BBC reports. It had spread from his thigh to his pelvis and 10 years of treatment had failed to keep it under control. Mr McGregor, who lives with his wife, Janis, had to have surgery to amputate his leg and remove the tumour. However, surgeons at Newcastle’s Freeman Hospital were concerned about how they would cover the hole that was left. Mr McGregor had a large and aggressive cancerous tumour in his thigh and pelvis (pictured in red) Surgeons needed to amputate Mr McGregor's leg but were worried about how they would cover the wound. So, they removed part of his calf to use as a graft once the leg and tumour were removed . As a result, they removed muscle and tissue from his calf and attached it to his arm to maintain the blood flow. They then amputated his leg and removed the tumour.

They were worried about how they would cover the large wound they would create. So, they took part of his calf and attached it to the blood supply in his arm to keep it alive. They then amputated his leg and removed the tumour before covering the wound with the calf tissue. Once this had been done, they used the calf flesh to cover the wound. The surgery, which took place in August 2013, started at 9am and did not finish until 3am the following day. Mr McGregor told the BBC: ‘You just can't put into words what they did. ‘I couldn't imagine what they were telling me, how they would do it and if I would wake up from the operation.’ Mr McGregor says he was given a choice as . to whether or not he wanted to go ahead with the operation.

He said: ‘You can't describe the feeling, you think you're at death's door and then you wake up and think wow, I'm here. It's a wonderful feeling.’ The surgeons now intend to publish a report about the operation as they think it could open up a new approach to surgery.

A mother-of-three has credited being obese with saving her life - after routine scans before weight loss surgery revealed a massive cancerous tumour on her left ovary. Emma France, 45, was 22 stone and a size 26 when she decided to book the bariatric surgery. She said: 'I’ll always be thankful that I decided to have the operation. If I hadn't, my ovarian cancer would never have been discovered and I wouldn’t be here today.' Obese: At a size 26 and weighing 22 stone, Emma France decided to undergo weight loss surgery in the Czech Republic . Lucky: But a routine ultrasound before her weight loss surgery revealed a 17cm cancerous tumour on her left ovary . After struggling to control her weight gain for years, Ms France, an accountant from Woking, Surrey, decided to have surgery to lose weight once and for all. She said: 'I’d always been a big girl. Over the years I’d tried every diet under the sun and would lose weight only to put it all back on again. 'I was stuck in a vicious cycle I just couldn’t break. 'I knew if I had any chance of losing weight I’d have to have surgery. I realised I wouldn’t be eligible to have surgery on the NHS but I couldn’t afford to get it done privately in the UK. 'Luckily I discovered a British company which sends patients abroad for surgery, which was a much cheaper option.' After seeking advice from her private consultant, Ms France decided to have a gastric wrap, which transforms the stomach into a narrow tube, restricting the amount of food patients can eat. Shock: Ms France (before her operation) said: 'The consultant told me he had discovered a mass near my ovaries, and I had to go back to the UK and see my GP straight away' In November 2011 she flew to the Czech Republic to have her surgery, having used all of her £5,500 savings to fund the operation. She said: 'I had mixed emotions, I was nervous but determined and excited, too. 'In the back of my mind I did wonder if the whole thing was too good to be true. I had phoned the clinic a few times and found it hard to get through, so I was wary, but I went anyway.' The symptoms of ovarian cancer can be difficult to recognise, especially in the early stages of the disease. This is because the symptoms are often very similar to those of less serious conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome. The . most common symptoms are an increase in abdominal size and persistent . bloating, persistent pelvic or abdominal pain, and difficulty eating. Other . symptoms include back pain, frequent urination, loss of appetite, . nausea, unexplained weight gain, changes to bowel habits and pain during . sex. Some patients also experience abnormal vaginal bleeding. Before seeing the consultant, Ms France had a series of pre-operation checks, including a routine ultrasound. She said: 'The consultant told me he had discovered a mass near my ovaries, and I had to go back to the UK and see my GP straight away. 'I was in a state of confusion. I was dozy from the drugs and found it hard to understand exactly what the surgeon was saying because of the language barrier.' On her arrival back in England, Ms France was referred to a gynecologicalcancer specialist and underwent an ultrasound, MRI and CT scan. She said: 'The oncologist told me I had a tumour on my left ovary. I was in shock but tried not to fear the worst. 'I just didn’t understand how I could have cancer when I had no symptoms at all. I didn’t feel ill.' On December 15th 2011, she underwent a two-hour operation during which a 17cm cancerous tumour was removed, and she had a hysterectomy. Ms France, who has children aged 21, 20 and 14, said: 'Luckily the cancer hadn’t spread. I was told I didn’t need to have chemotherapy, just regular checkups for five years. 'I thanked my lucky stars the cancer had been discovered early. I told friends that my tummy had saved my life.' After recovering from an infection, Ms France decided that she still wanted to go ahead with the weight loss surgery. On April 24th 2012 she flew back to the Czech Republic for the procedure. Relief: After successful surgery to remove the tumour, Ms France later underwent gastric bypass surgery and has since lost 7 stone . She said: 'The operation went to plan. I had to have liquids for two weeks before introducing tiny portions of mushy food into my diet.' Ms France also changed her diet drastically. Having habitually snacked on crisps, chocolate and cakes, she swapped to porridge for breakfast, soup for lunch and meat and vegetables for dinner. By January 2013 she had lost seven stone. Today she weighs 15st 7lb and can fit into size 16 clothes. She said: 'I've felt better than I have in years. I have more energy and I’m able to wear the kind of clothes I’d always dreamed of. I feel like a different person. 'I used to dress in black and try and cover myself up, but now I have a wardrobe full of coloured, fitted dresses, which I wear with pride. 'I’m so grateful my cancer was caught early. I now intend to live life to the full.'

Roaming charges for British travellers using their phones in EU countries are on course to be slashed from October. Proposals to outlaw the exorbitant fees  – which have led to holidaymakers and businessmen being hit by huge bills for using their mobiles abroad – are under review  in Brussels. It would mean anyone from the UK travelling to other member states would enjoy the same charges for calls, texts and data use as they would in their home country. Roaming charges for British travelers using their phones in EU countries are likely to be scrapped from October, it is claimed so Britons could browse the internet on their tablet on the beach (illustrated) or make a phone call for the same costs as they pay in the UK . The plans have been under consideration for months but were widely expected to fail by industry and government insiders. But yesterday it emerged that representatives of two member states believed the plans were ‘in the bag’ after high-level meetings with EU leaders. The discussions, at the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona, come weeks before a vote is expected on the issue, in mid-March. Experts predict the removal of roaming charges could wipe two per cent off mobile operators’ revenues, but some say it will encourage customers to use their phones more. It could also knock hundreds of pounds off the bills of UK holidaymakers, who on average spend an extra £120 on their mobile phone on each trip abroad, according to a recent study. Charlotte Nunes, from price comparison website uSwitch, said yesterday: 'Every year we rack up hundreds of millions of pounds using our mobiles abroad, so any regulation that helps keep costs down is always welcome. Experts predict the removal of roaming charges could knock hundreds of pounds off the bills of UK holidaymakers so they could make calls abroad without worrying about the cost . 'Despite the roaming caps already in place, people are still being stung.' Earlier this year, a study by the European Commission found that half of tourists in Europe are so terrified of huge bills that they refuse to use their phone on holiday. Under the current plans, operators could be banned from charging for incoming calls from as early as October, with negotiations beginning in July. All other roaming charges would be scrapped by 2016. Speaking last year, Neelie Kroes, the outgoing digital commissioner of the European Union, said: 'I have said from day one in this job that roaming charges should go. 'I want to show the EU is useful to people's lives.' The ban would follow caps on charges across the EU which have been in place since 2007. At the time phone, companies were estimated to make around £3.4billion from these fees. Current charge caps are €0.24 (20p) per minute for calls, €0.08 (7p) per text message and €0.45 (37p) per megabyte of data, all excluding VAT.

It may not quite have the glamour or glitz of the latest Hollywood blockbuster, but this blurry footage of an engineer standing in front of a camera is likely to be the first film ever shot in America. Revealed by GE and called 'Monkeyshines', it was created by engineers William Heise and William K. L. Dickson as they worked on the first device for viewing moving pictures. They made the movie for Edison Labs in 1889 or 1890 while working with Thomas Edison to develop and test the Kinetoscope, an early motion picture viewing device considered to be the precursor to movie projectors. The Kinetoscope is an early motion picture exhibition device designed for films to be viewed by one individual at a time through a peephole viewer window at the top of the device. The Kinetoscope was not a movie projector but introduced the basic approach that would become the standard for all cinematic projection before the advent of video, by creating the illusion of movement by conveying a strip of perforated film bearing sequential images over a light source with a high-speed shutter. First described in conceptual terms by U.S. inventor Thomas Edison in 1888, it was largely developed by his employee William Kennedy Laurie Dickson between 1889 and 1892. The full film, 56 seconds long, shows a lab worker 'horsing around' in front of the camera, and GE today released this animated gif version in tribute to the pair. The shots are an experimental film made to test the original cylinder format of the Kinetoscope. The films were intended to be internal tests of the new camera system, and were not created for commercial use, their rise to prominence resulted much later due to work by film historians. However, film buffs have never been able to prove who America's first film star was. Scholars have differing opinions on whether the first was shot in June 1889 starring John Ott or sometime between November 21-27, 1890 starring G. Sacco Albanese. Both men were fellow lab workers at the company.

Scientists have been able to get incredibly detailed views inside a living cell at a molecular level. A team of German researchers have managed to find a method of looking inside cells in their natural state and have produced the world’s first X-ray of a single cancer cell. Until now, scientists have had to dunk cells into preservative chemicals – killing it and subtly changing their internal structure – to get a closer view of it. A team of German researchers have managed to find a way of looking inside cells in their natural state and have produced the world's first X-ray of a single living cell (pictured) Thanks to analytical methods with ever-higher resolution than X-rays, scientists today can study biological cells at the level of individual molecules. But cells are usually chemically fixed before they are studied with the help of optical, X-ray or electron microscopes. The process of chemical fixation involves immersing the cells in a type of chemical preservative which fixes all of the cell's organelles and proteins in place. 'Minor changes to the internal structure of the cells are unavoidable in this process,' said professor Köster. The new technique of X-raying living cells, show these changes in direct comparison with fixed, dead cells, for the first time.' But researchers at the DESY Research Centre in Göttingen, Germany, used high-energy X-rays to study living biological cells. Their new method shows the clear differences in the internal cellular structure between living and dead, chemically fixed cells. ‘The new method for the first time enables us to investigate the internal structures of living cells in their natural environment using hard X-rays,’ Professor Sarah Köster of the Institute for X-Ray Physics of the University of Göttingen, said. The team described their new method for analysing live cancer cells from the adrenal cortex in the journal Physical Review Letters. They grew the cells on a silicon nitrite plate, which is almost invisible to X-rays and fed them with nutrients while pumping away metabolic waste using channels just half a millimetre in diameter. Study co-author Dr Britta Weinhausen said: ‘The biological cells are thus located in a sample environment which very closely resembles their natural environment.’ This photo shows an X-ray scan of a dead, chemically fixed biological cell. The color indicates how strong the X-rays are scattered at each individual point . The scientists used an X-ray beam to scan the internal nanostructure of the cells, but only blasted them for 0.05 seconds at a time to avoid damaging the living cells too quickly. Their method produced images so clear that nanometer-scale structures are visible. The researchers studied living and chemically fixed cells using the ‘nanodiffraction technique’ and when they compared the images of the cells, the new X-rays prove that the chemical fixing process makes big changes to tiny 30 nanometer to 50 nanometer structures in the cell. While the scientists have not speculated on what the new technique could mean for medical and scientific research, it will make it possible for experts to study living cells at high resolution and understand a living cell' inner mechanics better.","Researchers at the DESY Research Centre in Göttingen, Germany, used high-energy X-rays to study living biological cells .

They have become an essential part of everyday life, replacing everything from our TV to our games console. Yet analysts warn be may finally be tiring of constantly having to upgrade our smartphones - and say sales are set to drop dramatically. Growth in global smartphone shipments will fall sharply this year and keep slowing through 2018, with average prices dropping significantly as demand shifts to China and other developing countries, according to market research firm IDC. The end of an era? Annual smartphone sale growth in 2014 is expected to be 19.3 percent and then decline to 6.2 percent in 2018, IDC said in a report. According to the IDC report: . Android will maintain its reign as the leading operating system throughout IDC's forecast. iOS will remain the clear number 2 platform behind Android. Apple has maintained a tight focus on the high end of the market with its most current devices, a trend we expect to see continue into the future. Windows Phone stands to grow the fastest among the leading smartphone operating systems, with continued support from Nokia as well as the addition of new Windows Phone partners.BlackBerry will be under constant attack from the competition. Its higher-than-average prices compared to other platforms could inhibit its growth potential. Annual growth in 2014 is expected to be 19.3 percent and then decline to 6.2 percent in 2018, IDC said in a report. That follows a 39.2 percent jump in 2013 when smartphone shipments topped 1 billion units for the first time. The forecast reinforces concerns on Wall Street that the explosion in smartphones that began with Apple's iPhone in 2007 is coming to an end, at least in the United States and other developed countries where consumers favor pricey, top-tier handsets. Smartphone growth in North America and Europe is expected to shrink to single digits and Japan could even see a slight slowdown in shipments in the next few years, IDC said. Manufacturers are increasingly focusing on China where many consumers are upgrading from basic cellphones to smartphones selling for under $300. 'In North America we see more than 200 million smartphones in active use, not to mention the number of feature phones still being used,' said Ryan Reith of IDC. '2014 will be an enormous transition year for the smartphone market. 'Not only will growth decline more than ever before, but the driving forces behind smartphone adoption are changing. 'New markets for growth bring different rules to play by and 'premium' will not be a major factor in the regions driving overall market growth.' The average selling price for smarpthones last year was $335, already far below flagship devices like the iPhone 5S or Samsung Galaxy S4, and will fall to $260 by 2018, IDC said. 'In order to reach the untapped demand within emerging markets, carriers and OEMs will need to work together to bring prices down,' said Ramon Llamas, Research Manager with IDC's Mobile Phone team. 'Last year we saw a total of 322.5 million smartphone units ship for under $150 and that number will continue to grow going forward. 'We've already seen numerous smartphone announcements targeting this priceband this year, with some as low as $25. 'Just as the dynamics have changed for overall smartphone growth, so have the dynamics for smartphone pricing in the markets where continued growth is expected. 'Not all vendors will want to get into this space, but those that do must make deliberate choices about their strategies in order to succeed.'","Sales to fall sharply this year until at least 2018, IDC report claims .

Just a child’s first steps are a proud moment for any parent, an orphaned pelican’s first real flight was such a big achievement for a group of humans who taught him to fly – that they filmed the moment the giant bird took to the air. Big Bird the pelican was abandoned by his flock after a storm hit Lake Tanganyika in Tanzania. The three-month old bird washed up in Greystoke Mahale Park, injured and unable to feed himself. Scroll down for video . An orphaned pelican's first real flight was such a big achievement for a group of humans who taught him to fly - that they filmed the moment the giant bird took to the air . The Great White Pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus) breeds from southeastern Europe through Asia and in Africa in swamps and shallow lakes. In flight, the pelican is an elegant soaring bird. Males are larger than females, and have a long beak that grows in a downwards arc, as opposed to the shorter, straighter beak of the female. Male pelicans typically weigh between 12kgs and 15kgs and have a wingspan of around 3.6metres – the second largest of any bird. As staff helped the ruffled animal recover, they realised Big Bird might not have learned to fly and set about trying to teach him by running up and down the beach with him, flapping their arms to encourage the bird to flap his wings. ‘He didn't fly for some weeks but with encouragement he got the idea. We aren't sure how much flying he may have already done before arriving here but he was pretty shaky in his next attempts on the beach,’ staff wrote on Nomad Tanzania's blog. ‘We would run up and down flapping our arms and simulating flight for him. He would look on curiously until one day he showed us how it was done!’ As staff helped the ruffled animal recover, they realised Big Bird might not have learned to fly and set about trying to teach him by running up and down the beach with him, flapping their arms (pictured) to encourage the bird to flap his wings . To capture the moment when Big Bird first took to the air with ease, the staff attached a small GoPro camera to its beak (just visible) To capture the moment when Big Bird first took to the air with ease, the staff attached a small GoPro camera to its beak so that the pelican could effectively film himself in flight. ‘We are so proud of him and he is such a clever bird. He can fly!’ they said. The bird’s first attempts at flying were ‘short and uncontrolled and we would look away when he was landing as he seemed to not distinguish between ground and air speed coming in way too fast and endangering our beach furniture,’ the said. Staff at Greystoke Mahale Park said that Big Bird's first attempts at flying were 'short and uncontrolled and we would look away when he was landing as he seemed to not distinguish between ground and air speed coming in way too fast and endangering our beach furniture.' Here the bird is filmed taking off . All the lessons paid off: Big Bird the orphaned pelican films himself flying over a lake in Tanzania . Trying to teach the animal the life skills to survive, park workers also had to feed the pelican, which couldn’t fish without his flock and simply waddled up the beach for help and food five months ago. The birds do not dive for fish, but instead corral fish by working together as a flock, before scooping the trapped fish into their large stretchy pouches beneath their beaks. It is thought that Big Bird was separated from his flock after he was sucked into a large cumulonimbus storm cell - vertical clouds producing thunder and torrential rain - and thrown off course on the lake. Big Bird the pelican was abandoned by his flock after a storm hit Lake Tanganyika in Tanzania, pictured and was looked after by staff at Greystoke Mahale park, also marked on the map . It is thought that Big Bird (pictured) was separated from his flock he was sucked into a large cumulonimbus storm cell - vertical clouds producing thunder and torrential rain - and relocated on the lake . Experts said the nearest flock of great white pelicans, to which Big Bird might have belonged, is in Katavi National Park around 93miles (150kms) away from the lakeside park.

Poor Guy - he's around them all day long at the fast food chain where he works part-time, but Guy Sykes, 20, has a big problem: a phobia of onions. His chronic food fear - officially known as alliumphobia - means that although he's surrounded by food at the McDonald's restaurant where he works, he is drastically underweight for his six foot height. So while many start the New Year needing to shift a few pounds, Guy, from Berwick in Northumberland, wants to pile them on. Guy scans food ingredients in a desperate bid to avoid onions, his food phobia . He's surrounded by fast food but a phobia of onions leaves Guy Sykes seriously underweight for his height . But when he's not working, he's busy frantically scanning food ingredients for dreaded mentions of onions, the food stuff that freaks him out. At 6ft and weighing in at just eight and half stone, Guy was short of energy and knew he was seriously underweight for his height. On average, he was eating a quarter of the 3,000 calories he should have been getting for a man his age and height, having an energy drink for breakfast, no lunch and a tiny plate of pasta for dinner. Clothes hang off skinny Guy, who works around onions at McDonald's but has a phobia of them . A manager at McDonald's, the media student at Sunderland University said: 'I wasn’t a picky eater as a kid. I was one of those who’d have to have a clean plate before they could leave the table and would eat the same meals as my parents. I shot up at 14 and as I got older I knew I wasn’t the correct weight for someone of my height but I’ve never had much of an appetite. It doesn’t help that I’ve got an onion phobia. 'I have no idea why but everything about them I don’t like. Onions are a complete no-go for me and they are in so many meals. I’m constantly checking the lists of ingredients of things to see if there are onions as they are in so many meals.' Despite enjoying dishes such as steak, fish and a Sunday roast, Guy has struggled over the years to put on weight and his image was starting to have a negative impact on his mood. Guy wants to pile on the pounds but his onion phobia gets in the way . Wanting help, he applied for TV show Supersize vs Superskinny and tonight his efforts to pile on the pounds with the help of TV medic Dr Christian Jessen will be aired on Channel 4. Being partnered with someone struggling to lose weight Guy, who splits his time between Sunderland and his parents’ home in Berwick, had to match meal-for-meal the diet of Joanne Allen, weighing in at more than 19 stone, before the pair embarked on personalised diet plans. 'I was having to eat fried chicken, pizzas, all different kinds of takeaways every three hours a day. I was taking in 6,000 calories and found it really difficult,' said Guy. 'By the end of each day I felt physically drained with the sheer amount of food. We were then given a diet plan and given six weeks to try and change our weight. 'I decided to do it for myself and started making changes eating what I thought would be better. It was a conscious effort each day to make my portion sizes bigger and make sure I had three meals a day as well as snacking.' In six weeks Guy put on half a stone, and by sticking to his new diet plan, he’s now nearing a one stone weight gain. Guy, who still works at the fast food chain in his home town said: 'During the show I was told it is harder for people to lose weight than put it on and you have to double your daily calorie intake to put on just a couple of pounds. 'I’ve been sticking with it and would like to get up to 10 stone, and if I reach that target I’ll keep going.'","Onions are a 'no go' area, for 20-year-old media student Guy Sykes .

The parents of an ill teenage girl caught in the midst of a custody battle with doctors in Massachusetts won a small victory after a judge decided that their daughter should receive care from her original team of physicians. Juvenile Court Judge Joseph Johnston ruled on Monday that Justina Pelletier, 15, should be under the care of physicians from Tufts Medical Center, who had been previously treating the girl forMitochondrial Disease, a rare genetic muscle-wasting illness. The judge also lifted a gag order imposed on the girl's parents and doctors last year. For over a year, parents Lou and Linda Pelletier have been fighting with Boston Children's Hospital and the Massachusetts of Department of Children and Families, who in February 2013 took over custody of Justina when she was admitted for flu. Scroll down for video . Justina Pelletier, 15, will now get treatment from Tufts Medical Center physicians, which is what her parents have been fighting for over a year . Boston Children's physicians said the teen was not suffering from Mitochondrial Disease but instead had Somatoform Disorder, a stress-related mental . illness where people 'imagine they are ill'. The Pelletiers challenged that diagnosis, asking that their daughter continue treatment with her doctors from Tufts. Boston Children's Hospital resisted and the state took custody of the girl, moving her to a residential psychiatric unit at the end of January 2013. She has remained in state care since. 'This is a victory, but the battle is long from being over,' her father, Lou Pelletier, told ABCNews this week. 'The [Department of Children and Families] is still in charge, Justina . is still in a psychiatric residential facility and the child abuse . charges have not gone away.' Miss Pelletier is currently being treated at Wayside Youth & Family Support Network in Framingham, Massachusetts, far from where her parents live in West Hartford, Connecticut. Her parents are still trying to regain custody of her and have her treated close to home in Connecticut. A judge's decision last week to place Miss Pelletier in foster care and not be returned to her family caused her mother Linda to faint at a Boston courthouse. The 56-year-old, who is diabetic, was stretchered out and taken to Massachusetts General Hospital. Family and friends of Justina Pelletier have been rallying to get the sick teen back in her parents' custody . Linda Pelletier was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital last week, accompanied by her daughter Jennifer, after she collapsed on finding out that her sick daughter Justina will remain in foster care . Speaking from her Connecticut home following her collapse, Linda Pelletier told MailOnline that doctors said her blackout . was caused by the high stress she has been suffering over her daughter's . ordeal, which the mother described as 'evil'. Mrs Pelletier said: 'I ask my husband every day, ''Are they trying to kill her?''' Mrs Pelletier, who has three other daughters and cares for her 93-year-old mother at home, told MailOnline last week: 'I have had no medical updates about my child. She is deteriorating - she can't stand, sit, she has chronic pain. 'When I saw her [recently], her stomach was distended, she didn't feel well. But nobody helps her.' Massachusetts Department of Children and Families said in a statement: 'The Department of Children and Families does not comment or provide any information regarding children in our custody. Additionally, the Court has maintained a gag order in this case, prohibiting any parties from discussing the case or details surrounding it.' Wayside Youth residential unit in Framingham where Miss Pelletier is currently being held was unable to comment on specific cases.

A Liberal Democrat activist sparked a row after he made an apparent gun gesture at a waxwork of David Cameron and wrote: 'Wouldn't you?'. Shaun Boughton, 38, was at London's Madame Tussauds when he posted the photo on Twitter, where he had attacked Tories calling for fewer seats on Colchester Borough Council, Essex. The council's opposition leader hit back, calling the Tweet by Mr Boughton - who stood for a council seat last year and lost - 'deeply disturbing' and 'highly inappropriate'. The Tweet, which was posted on Sunday morning, was deleted two days later after local newspaper the Colchester Gazette contacted the councillor. It was posted in a reply to Lib Dem councillor Jon Manning, who had laid into Tory support for plans to cut the number of seats from 60 to 51. Mr Boughton also wrote that the party was 'a bunch of out of touch chinless old Etonians toffs [sic]'. Will Quince, Conservative group leader on the authority, described the Tweet as deeply disturbing and called on the Lib Dems to block Mr Boughton from representing them in the future. He told the local newspaper: 'This is highly inappropriate and not the conduct expected of someone standing for election. 'I hope the Liberal Democrats will not allow him to stand as a candidate and distance themselves from this deeply disturbing and distasteful behaviour.' After some constituents said he was being oversensitive, he told MailOnline he was standing by his comments. He added: 'A joke in politics is fine but I think this was a step too far.' Popular: Mr Boughton was on a day out to the Madame Tussauds waxwork museum in central London . In good company: Mr Cameron's waxwork was placed at the London tourist attraction next to those of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande in 2012 . Mr Boughton denied he was pretending to point a gun at the Mr Cameron waxwork, but said he could not explain what he was doing. He said: 'If that’s the way they want to portray it, then let them get on with it. 'If they find it offensive I will respond and I will take anything off. That’s not a problem.' He later Tweeted an apology, saying: 'For any offence that was taken in a recent picture I posted in regard to #conservatives I apologise stupid of me.' Nick Barlow, leader of Colchester Council’s Lib Dem group, said he had been unaware of the Tweet and the Conservative reaction to it. Spot the difference: Real-life Samantha Cameron with the waxwork of her husband after the 2010 election . He said: 'It’s up to the local party to decide whether he’s right to be a candidate for the local elections.' The council is run by a coalition of Liberal Democrats and Labour. Mr Boughton's day out also saw him riding the London Eye and tweeting to the TV presenters Ant and Dec. Mr Boughton was not the first Essex politician to cause controversy on Twitter. Danny Mayzes, a Tory member of nearby Tendring District Council, was suspended by the Conservative Party last October after Tweeting: 'Am watching Machete - now that’s how you deal with immigration issues.' The film showed a US senator try to win backing for an electrified border fence and also includes attacks on immigrants by vigilante patrols. He later apologised and deleted his account. And Colchester Labour cabinet member Tine Bourne faced censure after posting a picture of a Champagne bottle hours after Baroness Thatcher’s death last April. She later apologised for being 'crass' following a string of complaints. Colchester's Lib Dem MP Sir Bob Russell has avoided setting up a Twitter account.

A crossbow-wielding thug is being hunted after he left a pet cat fighting for her life by shooting her straight through the abdomen. Esther, a two-year-old tabby, was inches from being mortally wounded by the dart shot into her right-hand side, which punctured her intestine and pancreas. Had it been a couple of inches further forward it would have ripped through her lung - a wound she would have had no chance of surviving. Emergency: Two-year-old tabby Esther photographed after her operation to remove the crossbow dart, which left her fighting for her life after it was shot into her right-hand side and punctured her intestine and pancreas . Esther's owner, Bob Jevon, found the injured pet lying in her basket while he was getting ready to go to work. 'I came down at 6.30am and saw she had a big dart sticking out of her,' said Mr Jevon. 'It must have only just happened because she started to slow down soon after when the adrenaline wore off and the shock took over.' Mr Jevon rushed Esther to his local vets in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, where medics operated to remove the dart and patch up her lacerated organs. She fought to survive for 72 hours before finally stabilising, but still needed another week of intensive nursing before finally pulling through. Deeply embedded: An X-ray shows how the crossbow bold went nearly all the way through Esther's body . Vets say Esther is likely to make a full recovery from the attack, which happened on February 25. 'She's on lots of antibiotics,' said Mr Jevon, who lives with his wife Angela and their other cat Polly in Tonbridge, Kent. 'She's totally zonked and completely out of it like she's in a pussycat equivalent of an opium den. 'She has to stay inside for another week until her stitches are taken out.' After the callous attack, Mr Jevon is now calling for more controls on and monitoring of the sales of crossbows and air pistols. 'They can be bought in sports shops or online and anyone can buy them as no proof of age is needed,' he said. 'Kids have them in town and put pictures up on sheds and shoot right through them. 'Almost the whole dart was inside her and she was so lucky it didn't puncture a lung - she had a very lucky escape.' Now he wants to find who was responsible for the shooting, which Kent Police is investigating. 'It happened at an odd time which makes me think it may have been an adult who was fed up with cats pooing in their garden,' he said.

Duncan Mitchell, who treated Esther at the Culverden Road practice in Tunbridge Wells, said: 'Incidents like this are fortunately extremely rare and whilst I have seen cats shot with air gun pellets, I have never seen a crossbow injury in my 23 years of practice. 'She was extremely lucky to survive as the bolt had punctured her intestines and also her pancreas. 'It was very touch and go for the first 72 hours whether she would survive but after six days of intensive nursing she pulled through and was able to go home. 'If the bolt had been a couple of inches further forward she may well not have survived. 'Although one sees these incidents on TV and in newspapers it is still shocking to see it in person and to deal with the understandably upset owners.'","Dart was inches away from puncturing two-year-old tabby Esther's lung .

A chemical used to make yoga mats has been found in almost 500 food items, according to a study released this week. The compound azodicarbonamide (ADA) is typically used in bread products to bleach flour and make the dough stronger while keeping it light and spongy. The additive is also an ingredient of shoe rubber and attic insulation, according to research released on Thursday by The Environmental Working Group (EWG). ADA features in foods made by at least 130 American brands including Jimmy Dean, Sara Lee, Pillsbury, White Castle, Marie Calledar's and Country Hearth. Scroll down for video . What's on your plate? A chemical called azodicarbonamide (ADA) which is used to make yoga mats (left) has also been found in close to 500 food products including many 'healthy' breads, salad croutons and fruit strudels (right) Most of the items which contain ADA are bread, pre-made sandwiches, croutons and snacks. According to EWG, the synthetic additive has not been a problem for the federal Food and Drug Administration - because the low levels of 45 parts per million are not known to be toxic. However a study by the World Health Organization showed that when handed in large quantities, the chemical causes respiratory problems including asthma and skin sensitization. ADA has not undergone extensive testing for its long-term affects on health. According to FoodBabe, who has campaigned against the use of ADA in foods, when the chemical partially degrades with the heat of processing, it can form trace amounts of semicarbazide, which shows carcinogenicity and also has been shown to cause tumors. Subway last month announced that it was removing the ingredient Azodicarbonamide . (ADA) as part of an ongoing effort to improve recipes in the U.S. (it . was not being used in sandwiches in the UK, much of Europe and Australia . where the additive is banned). Subway founder Fred DeLuca (pictured) announced last month that ADA was being removed from breads used to make their sandwiches in the U.S. According to Environmental Working Group, each product on the list below includes ADA: .

On trial: Award-winning cameraman Huw Talfryn Walters outside Cardiff Crown Court where he is accused of forging his wife's signature . An award-winning BBC cameraman forged his wife's signature to pay off nearly £60,000 in debts, to save himself from bankruptcy, before leaving her, a court heard. Bafta-winner Huw Talfryn Walters, 50, allegedly spent the money on buying expensive camera and photographic equipment. But the court heard the freelance cameraman kept his wife in Helen Bowen in the dark about his spiralling money problems. A jury was told he forged Helen’s signature to take £59,000 from the joint mortgage on their marital home in Cardiff. He then ended their 14-year marriage after telling his wife he needed to put their house up for sale. Walters allegedly told Miss Bowen: 'I’m divorcing you because if I don’t I’m going to go bankrupt.' Cardiff Crown Court heard Walters forged his wife's signature three times to draw down cash from their take £59,000 from their joint mortgage. Prosecutor John Davies said: 'Miss Bowen made a career change around 2005 and after that left the mortgage and bills to her husband who she trusted. 'They separated in December 2011 and not long after that she became aware the mortgage had increased without her agreement. 'She contacted the bank to obtain copies of the three withdrawals which increased the size of the mortgage by £59,000. 'She realised the signatures on them didn’t belong to her - they were written by her husband without her knowledge while they still lived together.' Freelance cameraman Walters has worked on programmes including the BBC Proms, Doctor Who and Channel 4’s history show Time Team. He has won two Welsh Baftas for his cinematography and camera work in recent years. Mr Davies told the jury: 'This was a man who needed the money and was prepared to use whatever means he could to meet his outgoings. 'These were deliberate and dishonest acts and now he must pay for it.' The court heard a forensic handwriting expert proved Miss Bowen’s signature had been written by her husband. Holding back tears Miss Bowen said: 'The breakdown of our marriage was completely and utterly sudden. 'The week before he left, my husband had asked me where I would like to spend my 50th birthday and said he felt I needed a new car. Then he just ran out of the door. 'We met a couple of days later in . Starbucks and he said he was going to divorce me for unreasonable . behaviour because if he didn’t he was going to go bankrupt. 'He said he couldn’t wait the two years for a separation by consent and needed the money from the house to pay off his debts. 'I guessed something was wrong a few days after he left because the credit card companies started ringing.' Cameraman: Freelance cameraman Walters has worked on programmes including episodes of Doctor Who . Denial: The 50-year-old racked up £59,000 buying expensive camera equipment for his job, which involved working on the BBC proms (pictured). Walters denies three charges of fraud . She said she didn’t discover he had forged her signature until a few months after their separation - when she was contacted by her mortgage provider. She said: 'I trusted my husband - I was married to him and I loved him very much. 'I didn’t think he would have done anything to me like this. 'I am incredibly cautious with money and I will save for something I want and never pay for anything if I haven’t got the money. 'I cannot say the same of my husband.'

Rhinos could be moved from the plains of South Africa to Australia in a last-ditch attempt to save two of their species from extinction. Black and white rhinos are classed as 'critically endangered' and are being slaughtered in record numbers for their ivory, with one sub-species, the western black, confirmed as extinct last year . But businessmen Ray Dearlove and Allan Davies, who founded the Australian Rhino Project last December, have a plan. They are currently in discussions with Taronga Zoo and the Australian and South African governments about shipping the animals to Taronga Western Plains Zoo near Dubbo, central NSW, and bred in the hope of creating an ‘insurance’ population. The white rhino (pictured here) is one of two species of rhino that the Australian Rhino Project are trying to get to Australia in an attempt to preserve the threatened species . The Taronga Western Plains Zoo is already home to a small number of black and white rhinos. A Taronga Zoo spokesman said the plan was still in its ‘very early days.’ The next step, according to Mr Dearlove, is convincing the Australian government to relax its strict quarantine laws to allow the animals into the country. He said they would then need to convince the South African government to 'loan' the animals to Australia, he told Channel 10’s Studio 10 program. 2013 was the worst year on record for rhino poaching in South Africa, with 1004 illegally killed, according to South African Department of Environmental Affairs figures released in January. This means nearly three rhinos were poached every day, representing more than a 150 per cent increase on the number killed in 2012 - and a 3000 per cent increase since 2007. Poaching means white rhino numbers in South Africa are getting dangerously close to the tipping point when deaths outnumber births, pushing the population into serious decline. Prince William recently declared he would like to destroy the royal collection of ivory as a way of taking a stand against the slaughter. Rhino horns, which can earn as much as $20,000 per kilogram on the black market, are believed to cure a number of illnesses and ailments, including poisoning, hallucinations, typhoid, carbuncles, cancer, fever, and boils. But Dr Arne Schiotz of WWF told the National Geographic, said: ‘You would get the same effect from chewing your own fingernails.’ The horns are smuggled by transnational criminal networks to markets in Vietnam and China. There is evidence of links between the trafficking of rhino parts and other forms of organised crime, such as the trafficking of people, drugs, and weapons. 2013 saw more than 1,000 rhinos poached in South Africa. The white rhino and black rhino are now critically endangered species .","Plan to bring black and white rhinos from South Africa to Dubbo, NSW .

Leading scientists have given their backing to introducing a 99 per cent accurate Down's Syndrome test on the NHS. Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) can predict whether a baby has Down's Syndrome as early as the 10th week of pregnancy. It also screens for the rare genetic conditions Edward's syndrome and Patau syndrome. NIPT is currently only available in private hospitals, costing from around £300, but is being considered for use on the NHS by the UK National Screening Committee. Leading scientists have given their backing to introducing a 99 per cent accurate Down's Syndrome test on the NHS . It will make a formal recommendation on whether to introduce the test once the results of a trial at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in London become known. In a new development, a scientific impact paper published by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) supports giving the test to all women who want it in early pregnancy. At present, testing for Down's Syndrome involves a combination of an ultrasound scan of the baby and a blood test for the mother. Experts then estimate a woman's chance of having a baby with Down's. Those found to be at high risk can opt for invasive tests - amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. Both carry a one in 100 risk of miscarriage. A formal decision whether to introduce the test will be made once the results of a trial at Great Ormond Street Hospital are known . The new NIPT blood test detects a baby's genetic material and does not carry any risk of miscarriage like the invasive tests. Professor Peter Soothill, consultant in foetal medicine at the University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust and author of the scientific impact paper, said: 'This is the most exciting development in pregnancy care in many years. 'The new test is so accurate that the number of women who will need invasive tests is going to fall very dramatically while still informing those who wish to know about chromosomal abnormalities. 'The test is not yet available on the NHS but we think it will become a primary screening tool for all women who wish to know about foetal chromosomal abnormalities.' Advantages of the test include its high accuracy rate (over 99%) and ability to avoid invasive tests. However the experts said one disadvantage is that pregnant women may occasionally be informed of findings of uncertain significance, such as when there is a discrepancy between the chromosomal make-up of the cells in the placenta and the cells in the baby. Dr Sadaf Ghaem-Maghami, chair of the RCOG's scientific advisory committee, said: 'The potential for this technology is exciting and will provide much more accurate results for pregnant women. 'However, it is important that there are resources and training for health professionals offering this testing and an emphasis on discussions with the pregnant woman before the test about the implications of the results.' About 750 babies with Down's Syndrome are born in the UK each year.","Non-invasive prenatal testing predicts if a baby has Down's Syndrome .

Jeff Kinney has overtaken Roald Dahl as the most popular author in British schools - and David Walliams is fast catching up. Kinney, who penned the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series, pipped Dahl to first place in a top 10 list of the most-read children’s authors. Walliams, meanwhile, moved up the chart faster than any author, eclipsing JK Rowling and Michael Morpurgo to take fifth spot. Pipped: Jeff Kinney (left) has overtaken Roald Dahl (pictured) as the most popular author in British schools . Notable works: Kinney penned the Diary of a Wimpy Kid book (left), while Dahl was the author of The BFG (right) The comic, who created the Little Britain TV series, has written seven novels for children, with titles such as Mr Stink and Gangsta Granny. The trends emerged in the latest in a series of annual studies analysing the reading habits of tens of thousands of British schoolchildren. It found that Kinney, whose series features a young boy’s struggles with school and family, has pulled ahead of Dahl for the first time despite publishing a relatively small number of books. In an ‘extremely creditable performance’, Walliams was a new entrant in the top 10, behind Kinney, Dahl, Roderick Hunt, who wrote the Oxford Reading Tree series, and Francesca Simon, with the Horrid Henry books. Success: David Walliams moved up the top 10 list of the most-read children's authors faster than any author . Products: The comic has written seven novels for children, including Mr Stink (right) and Billionaire Boy (left) The sixth annual ‘What Kids are Reading’ report, which covered 426,000 children in more than 2,000 schools, also found that children’s reading habits deterioriate sharply when they reach secondary school. Up until the age of ten, the difficulty of books that children choose and the amount they read shows a steady increase. Popular: Francesca Simon, who wrote the Horrid Henry books (pictured), also placed in the top 10 list . But interest then dwindles, with many older children - including academic high-fliers - choosing books that are too easy for them, including books about football and star players. ‘There is a marked downturn in the difficulty of books at secondary transfer and this does not necessarily reflect a lack of ability to read more difficult texts,’ said the report’s author, Professor Keith Topping, of Dundee University. ‘It seems that secondary teachers and librarians are not encouraging students to attack more difficult books to a sufficient degree.’ He added: ‘Non-fiction needs to be read more widely but students need better guidance on reading at a level of difficulty which challenges them, as the difficulty of much non-fiction read in the later years was extremely low.’ Among teenagers, books about sport and football - such as biographies of Wayne Rooney and David Beckham - dominate the non-fiction charts. The titles ‘are appealing to older boys’ but may not be challenging enough for their ability levels. Boys and girls were found to choose books of equal difficulty, reversing a trend seen last year where girls were picking out more challenging books. The study analysed data from Renaissance Learning software, which assesses which books are being read in schools and tests children’s understanding of them through a series of quizzes. James Bell, the software firm’s professional services director, said: ‘The difficulty of books read and the accuracy with which they are understood is in fact on the rise, but there is still a significant problem with lack of challenge.’","Jeff Kinney has overtaken Roald Dahl as most popular author in schools .

Coalition relations are under growing strain after George Osborne led a Tory ambush on the Liberal Democrats – insisting the Government should enshrine in law a pledge for an EU referendum. At a Cabinet meeting to determine the Government’s programme for the year ahead, the Chancellor and Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith demanded an EU Referendum Bill, which has repeatedly been rejected by Lib Dems. The plan was immediately turned down by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and education minister David Laws, whose party opposes Tory plans for an in/out referendum on EU membership by 2017. Tory Chancellor George Osborne demanded an EU Referendum Bill be included in the Queen's Speech, but Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has rejected the idea of legislating for an in-out vote . David Cameron then sprung a further . surprise on the Lib Dems by declaring that legislation to allow . constituents to trigger a ‘recall’ vote on errant MPs – which Mr Clegg . has attempted to blame the Prime Minister for killing off – should go . ahead. In another sign of . coalition bad blood, Mr Cameron was also accused of ‘stealing’ an . announcement from Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable on the . Government’s acceptance of a recommendation that the minimum wage should . rise to £6.50 an hour. The . Chancellor’s aides were said to have been in talks with Lib Dem . officials yesterday morning about the timing of Mr Cable making the . announcement, only for the Prime Minister to steal his thunder in a . speech on the economy hours later. Prime Minister David Cameron also surprised the Lib Dems by saying would now support giving voters the power to oust MPs . Under pressure from the Eurosceptic UK Independence Party, David Cameron used a speech in January last year to set out his plan to renegotiate a 'fresh settlement' with Brussels, clawing back powers to London. If he is Prime Minister after the next election he would then hold an in-out referendum. The in/out referendum would take place before 2017, halfway through the 2015-20 Parliament. The . Tories also drew up a backbench Bill which would legislate for a . referendum, but this has been killed off by opposition from Labour and . the Lib Dems in the House of Lords. Now the Tories want it included in the Queen's Speech this year, something the Lib Dems would block. ‘This . is the Lib Dems getting a taste of their own medicine,’ said one senior . Tory. ‘If they don’t want to let people have a say on Europe then we . are going to rub their noses in it again and again.’ Earlier . this year, Labour and the Lib Dems conspired to kill off a Tory MP’s . backbench bill, supported by the party leadership, which would commit . the Government to holding an EU referendum by 2017. Mr Cameron has pledged to hold such a vote if he remains Prime Minister after the next election. But . the Tories say the commitment should be enshrined in legislation to . assure sceptical voters and have attacked Labour and the Lib Dems as . ‘enemies of democracy’ for refusing to support it. They insist the vast majority of voters want a say on EU membership. Mr . Osborne used yesterday’s Cabinet meeting to agree the contents of the . forthcoming Queen’s Speech, to express dismay that the Lib Dems are . withholding support for a referendum bill and insist he believed it . should be included. Sources said that he told the Cabinet meeting that it should be up to the public to decide on the issue. One . senior Lib Dem source said: ‘Raising this at this stage is a nakedly . transparent attempt to generate some controversy to appease angry Tory . backbenchers in the run-up to the Euro elections.’ Mr .

Rebecca Reeves, 34, was the head of a group of five women who targeted the elderly in the Lancashire town of Chorley . A girl gang nicknamed 'Chorley's Angels' charmed frail old men before exploiting them for cash. Security cameras captured one of the gang – whose name comes from the town where they carried out their crimes – flirting with her elderly victim and planting a kiss on his cheek after bluffing her way into his home. The five-strong group carried out reconnaissance activities around their Lancashire town, looking for vulnerable targets. They then posed as carers or offered to help the men with weekly shopping trips in order to win their trust – before asking for or simply stealing their money. At least 40 victims in their 70s and 80s handed over cash, but police fear there are many other elderly men who were targeted but are too embarrassed to come forward. Yesterday the leader of the gang, Rebecca Reeves, 34, was behind bars, sentenced to three years and eight months after admitting burglary and theft. She was also issued with a five-year criminal antisocial behaviour order banning her from offering services and sexual favours for money and from entering any sheltered or supported housing on her release. Her sister Emma, 36, and fellow gang members Tracy Halliday, 40, Lesley Bennett, 36, and Andrena Kelly, 36, have all been served with Asbos ordering them to stay away from potential victims. After a previous hearing, the son of one of the victims said: 'I am so angry with these women. They're just horrible people. 'Your natural human instinct is to look after vulnerable old people, yet these women pretended to care when they didn't.' Many of the gang's victims were men with physical disabilities or dementia who lived alone, Preston Crown Court was told. On one occasion, Rebecca Reeves broke into a house belonging to a frail and infirm 57-year-old. He often left the door unlocked to allow his carers to get in, but in June last year the man said he heard a noise and propelled himself in his wheelchair to investigate.

On Sunday, a 95-year-old World War II veteran suited up in his decades-old Army uniform to cheer on the runners in a race held to honor an American hero who gave up an NFL career to serve his country as an Army Ranger in Afghanistan. Joe Bell - who was a corporal in the U.S. Army from 1942 to 1946 - didn't expect to become the star of the show. But that's exactly what happened. During the Pat's Run event in San Jose, California, Bell looked on and cheered as the runners passed him by. Out of nowhere, the runners stopped passing him by - rather, they stopped one-by-one and thanked the 95-year-old vet for his service. Respect: 95-year-old Joe Bell served in the Army during World War II and wore his uniform during Pat's Run on Sunday . Pit stop: In the middle of the race, runners began leaving the race route to shake hands with Bell, who watched from his front lawn . Inspiring: Bell says he decided to wear his uniform during the race to inspire the runners . Bell was stunned by the support and gratitude he received from people who in most cases were about 50 years his junior. 'They showed a lot of love to me, and they recognized me,' Bell told ABC News. 'I liked that.' A reporter for the San Jose Mercury News happened to live on the same street as Bell, and went outside to watch the runners pass. 'When I got outside, the parade of well-wishers had waned, but when Joe started clapping for the runners, they started cheering back at him,' reporter Julia Prodis Sulek wrote in an article published on the newspaper's website. 'I started the video running, and then one runner pulled off the street and over to the sidewalk.' Sulek's video has since achieved viral status on the Internet, and the story was featured on several morning news shows, including NBC's Today Show. Neighbors: Bell's neighbor is a reporter for San Jose Mercury News and caught the touching moment on video . Pat's Run is an annual race to benefit the Pat Tillman Foundation, which provides scholarships to military veterans and their spouses. Tillman played high school football in the San Jose area before heading to Arizona State University for his college ball. Tillman was drafted by the Arizona Cardinals in 1998 and excelled as a safety - at one point in his career, Tillman turned down a $3.6 million contract to play with the St Louis Rams out of loyalty to the Cardinals. In 2002, Tillman left the NFL at the height of his career to join the Army, and served several tours of duty in both Afghanistan and Iraq as an Army Ranger, an elite group of soldiers tasked with some of the U.S. military's most dangerous missions. Hero: Pat's Run is in honor of Pat Tillman, an Army Ranger who gave up a career in the NFL to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan . On April 22, 2004, Tillman was killed by friendly fire in Afghanistan. The circumstances surrounding his death have been heavily scrutinized by his family and military officials. It was the memory of Tillman that inspired Bell to wear his Army uniform on Sunday. 'It was an amazing thing,' Sulek says. 'I think he was surprised and touched. I asked him, why was he in uniform?

Novy Chardon was 34 years old when she disappeared from her Upper Coomera home near the Gold Coast on February 6 last year. Police said the man living at the Mount Nathan property in the Gold Coast Hinterland, where the search was conducted, knows Mrs Chardon's husband, John Chardon. The site where the vehicle was found in the Mount Nathan yard. There were fears Mrs Chardon had been entombed when the car was buried under earth . Police have confirmed the man living at Mount Nathan home knows Mrs Chardon's husband, John Chardon. After finding the vehicle, the house on Eden Park Court was also searched as part of investigations. The man who lives at the property has since been questioned by police about Mrs Chardon's disappearance. His solicitor Campbell MacCallum arrived at the house and claimed his client's innocence. The Gold Coast Bulletin reported Mr MacCallum said his client did bury the items in his backyard, but insists they have nothing to do with the unsolved case. Police arrived at the house on Tuesday night after a search warrant was issued. An excavator was needed to remove earth covering the vehicle, which was found on Wednesday . The man living at the property has denied having any knowledge or involvement in the case . 'The person residing at this address denies any knowledge or involvement in the investigation,' he said. 'He’s a bit upset and denies any involvement ... He doesn’t think there’s anything to worry about.' Mr MacCallum said police were looking for a vehicle and he did not know how his client knew Mrs Chardon’s husband, John Chardon. Detecive Superintendent David Hutchinson said the search was sparked by information they received from neighbours. 'Well, obviously it’s an unusual thing to bury a car in a backyard,' Det Supt Hutchinson said. Missing: Vanishing on February 6 last year, police say there is no doubt Novy Chardon (pictured) has been murdered . Mrs Chardon's husband John Chardon (pictured) is currently overseas. He has denied playing any part in the disappearance despite his lawyer calling him the chief suspect in court . 'We believe we know the reason why the vehicle was buried there, but we obviously need to excavate the land and recover the vehicle to confirm the exact situation. 'We don’t have any information at this time that Novy Chardon is buried there. 'I think burying a utility in the backyard, by itself, raises suspicions so you would have to wonder why they would do that. We understand, we believe, why that occurred, but we want to recover the vehicle first to substantiate things. But if you’re going to bury it in the back yard, you probably wouldn’t do it at night.' Det Supt Hutchinson said John Chardon, who is travelling overseas, had not been contacted about the discovery. Since discovering the car, police are using an excavator to dig it out. Neighbour Scot Viner said he saw the property owners excavating the backyard about a year ago during renovations. The Courier Mail reported Mr Viner said his son was riding the property owner's digger while they were digging holes. Mount Nathan, where the excavation has taken place, is located in the Gold Coast Hinterland in Queensland . On the day she disappeared, Mrs Chardon visited her lawyer to finalise a divorce settlement . 'He (the owner) was digging a spot. He was saying a water tower is going here and a deck is going there. It’s hard to believe anything suspicious about it,' he said. Adding to speculation that the missing Indonesian-born woman could be entombed in a car, Mr Viner said he saw a car sitting in the backyard ‘for ages’. He said he was unsure if the car had been buried. Senior-Sergeant Mark Procter, of Coomera CIB, said a search warrant was executed about 5pm Tuesday on the Mount Nathan rental property ‘in relation to the disappearance of Novy Chardon’. 'The house has been declared a crime scene and an excavator is being brought in,' he said. 'We expect the property to remain a crime scene for a number of days.’ Police launched a murder investigation after the mother-of-two disappeared on February 6 last year - the dig comes about a month after the first anniversary of her disappearance. Just two days after Mrs Chardon went missing, her 66-year old millionaire husband took the couple's two young children on a pre-planned business trip to Indonesia. He remained overseas for several weeks and at the time said Mrs Chardon had gone missing before and denied playing any part in her disappearance despite previously being named in court as the chief suspect by his own lawyer. Police have said the house will remain a crime scene for 'a number of days' No doubt: Police believe they are dealing with a murder case and said more than one person was involved in causing Mrs Chardon's death and disposing of the body . Police said last month there was 'no doubt' Mrs Chardon had been murdered with ‘more than one person was involved in causing her death and disposing of the body’. They also said that on the day of her disappearance, Mrs Chardon visited her lawyer to finalise a divorce settlement. The Courier-Mail reported that during police investigations several suspects had been identified and were facing interrogation at Crime and Misconduct Commission secret ‘star chamber’ hearings. After her disappearance, Mrs Chardon’s late model Volvo SUV was found abandoned near Nerang railway station. Police seized Mr Chardon’s car at Brisbane Airport, raided his Loganholme lubricant factory and the family home was declared a crime scene. An arrest related to the case is yet to be made and Mr Chardon is believed to be overseas on a business trip.

At Chipotle, guacamole costs extra - but it soon may not be available at all thanks to climate change. The Denver, Colorado-based chain of Mexican fast-food restaurants threatened to take the condiment off the menu because of the rising price of avocados. While the avocado crop is currently fine, scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory are predicting drier temperatures will lead to a 40 per cent drop in California's avocado crop over the next 32 years. Most modern scientists agree that there is a direct correlation between the increase of droughts and global warming, according to Think Progress. Sad news for lunch: Mexican fast-food chain Chipotle is threatening to take guacamole off the menu due to the rising price of avocados . 'Increasing weather volatility or other long-term changes in global weather patterns, including any changes associated with global climate change, could have a significant impact on the price or availability of some of our ingredients,' the chain wrote in their annual report released last month. Bad weather: Scientists are predicting a 40 per cent drop in avocado production over the next 32 years . 'In the event of cost increases with respect to one or more of our raw ingredients we may choose to temporarily suspend serving menu items, such as guacamole or one or more of our salsas, rather than paying the increased cost for the ingredients.' Any increase in avocado prices impacts Chipotle, which uses an estimated 97,000 pounds of the fruit a day to make guacamole - adding up to 35.4million pounds of avocados a year. Chipotle has made a promise to its . customers to source ingredients from organic, local and sustainable . sources, which means the cost of their ingredients are already more . expensive than other chains. Even . if the avocado crop is somehow unaffected, there's always rising prices . of the chain's other ingredients - such as beef - which could nudge the . already-pricy guacamole off the menu. However, . the chain has made clear that they don't want to take guacamole off the . menu and that doing so would hurt their business. 'Any such changes to our available . menu may negatively impact our restaurant traffic and comparable . restaurant sales, and could also have an adverse impact on our brand,' the report read. For now, the forecasted guacamole apocalypse may only affect Chipotle restaurants in California. Drought . conditions are already hurting produce production in the region, and . Chipotle sources its food from farms within 350 miles of where it will . be served.

Voters think David Cameron is ‘posh and out of touch’, Ed Miliband is a ‘weak idiot’ and Nick Clegg is a ‘spineless liar’, according to a survey. A major poll by former Tory Chairman Lord Ashcroft reveals that most of the electorate have little good to say about the country’s top politicians. The unflattering assessments emerged after voters were asked for the first word or phrase that came to mind when they thought of the main party leaders. Tory Prime Minister David Cameron is seen as posh and out of touch, Labour leader Ed Miliband was a weak idiot and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg was seen as weak and a liar . The most common descriptions for Mr . Cameron were posh and out of touch, with voters also describing him as . rich, arrogant and privileged. There . were few kind words, although ‘competent’ was the third most popular . description amongst men and the twelfth most popular amongst women. Voters . were even less positive about the Labour leader, with most rating him . as weak and an idiot. He was also labelled useless and untrustworthy, . with women also describing him as slimy and boring. The most positive assessment of Mr Miliband was that he is ‘trying’. Mr . Clegg was also subjected to a withering assessment by the electorate. Most voters view him as weak and a liar. Others described the Liberal . Democrat leader as useless, spineless and a puppet. The most positive . description was that he was ‘OK’. Voters were not asked to describe Ukip leader Nigel Farage. Polling by Lord Ashcroft showed Labour's lead was larger among women, according to a survey of 8,053 people in November 2013 . The . findings emerged in a survey of more than 8,000 voters, which revealed . widespread public disillusion with Britain’s politicians. However, . Lord Ashcroft said the findings also dispelled the popular theory that . the Conservatives have a ‘problem’ with women voters. The . poll, which was conducted in November last year, found that the . Conservatives enjoyed the support of 30 per cent of men and 29 per cent . of women. By contrast, Labour was backed by 37 per cent of men and 41 . per cent of women. But . Lord Ashcroft said: ‘The Conservative Party’s problem is not that it is . attracting enough women – it is not attracting enough of anybody. Pollster Lord Ashcroft said the polls show the Tories do not have a problem with women, but with all voters . ‘The . striking thing in the polls is not the gender gap, but the overall . numbers of either sex who are prepared to say the Tories stand for . opportunity or are on their side. ‘It . is not women who have a problem with the Conservatives, it is voters.’ Number 10 is highly sensitive to accusations that either the Government . or the Prime Minister himself are anti-women. Mr Cameron was accused of sexism after telling Labour frontbencher Angela Eagle to ‘calm down, dear’ in the Commons. Some . analysts have also warned that the Coalition’s austerity drive hits . women disproportionately. In the latest poll, voters were also asked to . say which of a series of statements they associated with the different . parties. The Tories scored . most highly for being ‘willing to take tough decisions for the long . term’ and because they were ‘competent and capable’. Labour scored highest for wanting to ‘help ordinary people get on in life’ and for being ‘on the side of people like me’. When . the results were separated by gender, women were less likely to rate . the Tories highly over  decision-making and competency. Women . also gave four descriptions of Mr Cameron which did not  feature in the . top 20 for men –  conservative, pompous, incompetent and family. Almost . all of the words associated with Mr Miliband were negative. Women . dubbed him boring, unsure, slimy and annoying, while men  singled him . out as being out of his depth, a geek, red, inexperienced and a . socialist. Some women described Mr  Clegg as nice, but most said he  was either boring, spineless, wet  or unsure. The . findings follow a poll earlier this week that suggested the . Conservatives have a bigger problem with young voters, the electorate in . Northern England and those from ethnic minorities than they do  with . women.","Men and women asked to name a word or phrase about three party leaders .

Claims firm parasites have taken up to £5billion of the compensation paid to victims of the PPI mis-selling scandal. Many companies sent people nuisance texts or cold-called them to create a lucrative database of victims. They then made claims for refunds of payment protection insurance premiums, often without being clear that they would take up to 25 per cent. Claims firms have taken up to £5billion of the compensation paid to victims of the PPI mis-selling scandal . As a result, people who had been duped by the big banks into buying unnecessary insurance to cover the repayments on loans, credit cards and mortgages were ripped off a second time by the claims firms. Britain’s major banks have set aside more than £22billion for refunds to victims of the biggest scandal in retail banking. Anyone mis-sold PPI should be able to claim a refund themselves for free by using a standard complaints letter. But many banks made it hard for customers, allowing claims firms to fill the gap and offer to help before creaming off much of the money that was returned. Britain's major banks have set aside more than £22billion for victims of the biggest scandal in retail banking . The scale of the rip-off was revealed today by Citizens Advice, which has been helping many let down by claims firms. It said almost one in three people who used a claims management company complained they were put under pressure to pursue a refund, while 27 per cent said the fee was not explained. Some whose claims were successful may actually have ended up in debt to the firms because if an individual is in debt to their bank, the lender can decide to use PPI compensation to pay off the outstanding figure. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said some claims management companies 'operate well below the standards that are expected' The customer then needs to find money to pay the claims firm – which may be £1,000. The Citizens Advice research shows that 39 per cent of claims firm customers had no idea that they could have made a claim themselves without charge. The group wants claims firms and other financial services to be banned from cold calling in order to halt the tide of nuisance calls and protect people from dodgy businesses. Its chief executive, Gillian Guy, said: ‘Consumers have lost out on billions of pounds worth of compensation because banks were too slow to get a grip on the PPI scandal. ‘By banks originally dragging their feet and providing inadequate redress, claims management companies seized an opportunity to take a up to 25 per cent of people’s compensation for admin work that consumers can do themselves for free. ‘Some claims management companies operate well below the standards that are expected and sometimes outside of the rules. The regulator needs to quickly revoke the licences of firms that are not up to scratch. ‘We’d like to see a ban on cold calling by claims companies which would spare people from nuisance calls and protect consumers from predatory firms. ‘There needs to be a shift in how banks treat their customers. Banks need to look at ways they can make money from saving their customers money, not mis-sell them products.’ Some financial firms are still failing to curb staff bonus schemes to eliminate the risk of another mis-selling scandal, the City regulator warned last night. In a probe, the Financial Conduct Authority found improvements among major banks, but said one in ten firms with sales teams were not managing the schemes properly.","Claims firms have taken up to £5billion of compensation from PPI victims .

The identity of the fatality has not been released and no updates have been given about the other injured parties. The number of injuries continued to rise after the explosion happened at around 12.50pm on Tuesday and the seven injured people were taken to various outposts of Capital Regional Medical Center. Raging: Seven people were injured and one of those injuries proved fatal after a gas pipe exploded at a housing complex in Ewing, New Jersey shortly before 1pm on Tuesday .

A teacher who arrived at her primary school smelling of alcohol and laughing 'uncontrollably' has been suspended for six months. Catrin Williams stomped around erratically and mocked the work of a pupil with learning difficulties, the General Teaching Council for Wales professional conduct hearing was told. Teaching assistant Ceri Falshaw said the Year Two teacher turned up late for work with mud on her clothes, which she said was because she had fallen over in her garden. When Miss Falshaw entered the classroom at Ysgol Yr Esgob, a primary school in Caerwys, Flintshire, North Wales, at 9.20am, she said Miss Williams smelled of alcohol and mouthwash and was laughing 'loudly and uncontrollably'. Catrin Falshaw was a teacher at Ysgol Yr Esgob, a primary school in Caerwys, North Wales. A hearing heard how the teacher was laughing uncontrollably when she arrived late for work . She stomped over to a wall display and fell into the wall, before using it to prop herself up. Miss Falshaw said Miss Williams 'appeared drunk' and that she mocked the work of a pupil with learning difficulties. Miss Falshaw added this kind of behaviour was 'most unusual' and the children in her class were 'agog' at her behaviour. Presenting officer Lousha Bryl said Miss Williams, of Denbigh, had written a letter in which she denied turning up at the school smelling of alcohol on January 28, 2013. She did not attend the hearing at St David’s Hotel in Ewloe, Flintshire, and was not represented. Professional conduct committee chairman Richard Parry Jones said Miss Williams’ actions 'breached the code of conduct and practice of a registered teacher'. Fellow teaching assistant Hayley Hannah told the hearing she let Miss Williams into the building on the morning of January 28 and could smell an 'overpowering' smell of mouthwash, which she suspected was used to conceal a smell of alcohol. Mrs Hannah expressed her concerns to other teaching assistants, who then informed head teacher Sue Clisham. Mrs Clisham told the hearing that as a result of the events Miss Williams was suspended pending an investigation. The teacher mocked the work of a child with learning disabilities before walking in to a wall and having to prop herself up, a hearing heard (library image) She left a 'lasting smell of alcohol' in the school office when she was called in at 10.45am, Mrs Clisham said. Mrs Clisham added that she did not feel Miss Williams should be in charge of a class or drive herself home. An independent investigation in May found that Miss Williams had presented herself for work smelling of alcohol and attending work while still under the influence, leading to her dismissal for gross misconduct. Williams appealed, but the dismissal was upheld, based on the seriousness of attending work smelling of alcohol. The charge of attending school while still drunk was overturned. After yesterday’s judgment Miss Williams will not be permitted to teach anywhere in Wales for the duration of the six month suspension and must provide the General Teaching Council for Wales with a written assessment from an approved medical professional that she is medically and physically fit to teach after that time. The assessment will specifically assess Miss Williams’ use of alcohol.

US officials have reportedly told Israel to stop killing off Iranian nuclear scientists. Israel Moussad spy agancy has supposedly taken out at least five top Iranian nuclear experts in an attempt to slow the country’s nuclear program and continues to do so despite recent agreements reached to end the country’s nuclear ambitions. The brazen hits were carried out using mostly car bombs, and the assassins were never captured, CBS News revealed Sunday in a shocking report as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu flew to Washington. Scroll down to video . Let's make a deal: President Barack Obama meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last year in the Oval Office - Obama is pressuring Israel to stop killing Iranian Nuclear experts and focus on ironing out differences with Palestine . Israel has never publicly acknowledged the program, according to the report, but it was designed to slow the rogue nation’s nuclear progress, as well as ‘deter trained and educated Iranians from joining their country's nuclear program.’ The Moussad operatives were able to get away with the killings as a result of an extensive network of safe houses within the Islamic state, ‘although several Iranians who may have helped the Mossad were arrested and executed,’ CBS claimed. An unidentified US official disclosed the program to CBS while claiming the Obama administration is leaning on its Middle Eastern ally to stop the targeted killings and wait for the current deal to disarm to play out. That has forced Netanyahu to redirect Moussad’s efforts towards finding proof Iran is cheating on the historic agreement. Agents are scouring the country looking for evidence, but have yet to find any. Netanyahu’s visit to the US capital is also expected to touch upon Israel – Palestine peace talks, and where the two nations stand on Jewish settlements in the West Bank. Palestine wants borders reset to the pre-1967 Isreali invasion lines, something Netanyahu signaled shortly before taking off is a non-starter. This hard line has forced the US to dial back expectations of a firm deal from next month to later this year.","Israel's feared Moussad spy agency has killed at least five Iranian nuclear experts .

A driver facing criminal charges for the breakneck 24-minute lap around Manhattan he recorded and posted online rebuffed a plea offer Tuesday involving two months in jail for a stunt seen widely online. Adam Tang, 32, pleaded not guilty Tuesday to reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor, stemming from his September arrest and then asked the judge to reinstate his revoked driver's license and passport. The judge agreed with prosecutors who decried the request and Tang remained without a license. Need for speed: Adam Tang, seen here at his September arrest, is allegedly Afroduck--the YouTube user who recorded and uploaded his reckless and record-breaking 24-minute race around the island of Manhattan . 'He videotaped himself circumnavigating Manhattan at a high rate of speed. He admits doing this,' Prosecutor Mary Weisgerber told Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Jill Konviser. 'He certainly should not have his license back.' A dashboard-camera video showed a BMW making a 26.4-mile loop around Manhattan in 24 minutes and 7 seconds. The New York Daily News notes that Tang allegedly told police he was Afroduck--the name used on the YouTube video account that made the footage famous--as well as other incriminating admissions. 'I can consistently do it in 24 minutes. I have done it in 24 minutes before, without a camera,' he said. 'I think I could do it in 19 minutes.' 'I have gotten speeding tickets in the . past. I have also had accidents,' court papers say he blabbed. 'I am a . car fanatic. I enjoy driving.' Defense . lawyer Gregory Gomez says there's no proof Tang acted recklessly. Tang . told authorities he never went over 100 mph and ran only one red light. The video shows the car stopping for six others. 'A jury will find what he did was not reckless,' Gomez told the Daily News. They're off! The 32-year-old Canada native allegedly began his breakneck race at 116th street in East Harlem . Fast: The video then shows the BMW hurtle past the Williamsburg, Manhattan, and Brooklyn Bridges, before tearing through the Battery Park Tunnel and around the downtown tip of the island to beat an earlier 2010 record of 26 minutes, three seconds . While still anonymous, the driver behind the video gave a revealing interview to car enthusiast blog Jalopnik, saying: 'I was always in control. In fact, this wasn't the first time I broke the record' Gomez says the Canadian-born Tang wants to avoid any criminal record because of possible immigration complications. After news of the stunt made headlines in September, NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly declared war on Afroduck, and made it a priority to track him down. The high-speed journey in a manual 2006 BMW Z4, begins at FDR/East Side Drive at 116th Street, just outside of Harlem, with Tan weaving through traffic, undertaking moving cars at breakneck speed. He then hurtles past the Williamsburg, Manhattan, and Brooklyn Bridges, before tearing through the Battery Park Tunnel and around the downtown tip of the island to beat an earlier 2010 record of 26 minutes, three seconds. While still anonymous, the driver behind the video gave a revealing interview to car enthusiast blog Jalopnik in August. 'I was always in control. In fact, this wasn't the first time I broke the record. I can do it consistently under 24 minutes and most likely beat my own record again,' he told the blog. He also invited anyone to try and beat his record. Risky business: Tang asked the judge Tuesday if he could have his license back, which she denied.

Police are now searching for two other Britons in relation to the alleged offence, known as 'courtsiding', following Dobson's appearance in court yesterday. Police prosecutor Josh Diemar told the court: 'He sent the agency the results before they could get them through the official channels. 'That data has been sent quicker than the official results can get posted, and had the ability to affect betting odds.' Mr Sass Nasimi, representing Dobson, said the Briton was collecting legitimate data for the betting agency. He said: 'The data was used to protect the agency from fluctuating odds. Charged: Dobson is charged with allegedly relaying match scores to an international betting service from courtside at the Australian Open on Tuesday . 'It is an exercise of collecting data about who has won a point.' The Briton, who was earlier said by police to have flown into Melbourne to specifically monitor matches at the Australian Open, was charged with one count of engaging in conduct that would corrupt a betting outcome - believed by detectives to be the first charge of its kind in the world. It has not been revealed what match Dobson had been monitoring before his arrest. Deputy Police Commissioner Graham Ashton said: . 'We believe he is part of a syndicate, but we don't yet have the . details. I don't think it's an isolated incident. 'Overseas, certainly, there are examples in relation to football, in relation to cricket. 'It's . been around for several years. It's particularly becoming more . difficult to do because of the speed of communications and technology . but it is still very active. 'As we know, the global tennis . betting market is in the tens of millions of dollars every day.' Among . the big names of tennis playing at the Open are Britain's Andy Murray, . Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer, Serena Williams and Maria . Sharapova. The magistrate adjourned the case until January 23 so the defence and prosecution could prepare for the charge, brought under legislation introduced in the state of Victoria last year covering offences related to cheating at gambling.

Employees at an Austin, Texas camera equipment store have created a comical version of security footage of a somewhat inept thief breaking into their store. Last Saturday at 1:28am, the thief stole several items from Texas Media Systems. The hilarious video shows surveillance footage of the robbery, set to the Mission Impossible theme song played by chorus of kazoos. Breaking in: The thief finally breaks through the shop's glass door before fumbling with the green screen . Mad dash: He runs into the store wielding a sledgehammer . The thief can be seen incompetently trying to break through the store's glass doors. Finally entering the store after outwitting a green screen, the thief, wielding a sledgehammer, smashes display cabinets and other items in his artless attempt at thievery. With each item the robber steals, a graphic appears over the security footage detailing the piece of equipment and its worth. Among the loot is a $60 mixer, a $299 boom microphone and a $400 camera. Loot: The inept thief gets his hands on a $60 mixer . Smashed glass: The thief caused a lot of damage but stole just a few relatively worthless items from the store . The bumbling burglar darts around the store, at one point dropping an expensive piece of equipment only to grab a significantly cheaper item in its stead. The video was posted on YouTube with the description: 'Our store got broken into. Judging from the surveillance video the thief doesn't seem to be highly skilled in his area.' The second half of the video, which features the burglar trying to leave the store, is set to Queen's Bohemian Rhasody - with kazoos, of course. The robber kicks his way out of the store, losing his mask as he goes, dropping all the things he stole and falling over onto the prone green screen.

Cold calling companies should give up harassing people on the phone because almost no-one will choose to do business with them, a consumer group said today. More than 9 in 10 people say they do not trust firms which call them out of the blue. Bill payers report being exasperated by personal injury lawyers, power firms and offers of cheap double glazing. More than 90 per cent of people do not trust the firms which call them out of the blue, as MPs call for action against the companies who plague us by phone . Citizens Advice is calling for financial companies, including payday lenders and claims management firms, to be banned from cold calling. According to a survey carried out for the consumer group, 92 per cent of people do not trust the companies who have sales reps pester them for business. Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy said it was proof cold calling does not work and is ‘nothing more than a nuisance’. She added: ‘It is time companies hang-up marketing plans that bombard people with unwanted phone calls, text messages and automated voicemails.  Nine in 10 people don’t trust companies that cold-call which is indicative of marketing that is nothing more than a nuisance. ‘I’d like to see financial service companies banned from cold calling. Citizens Advice is helping people who have been left seriously out of pocket after signing up to a service over the phone only to find it doesn’t deliver what was promised. Lib Dem MP Mike Crockart said he is fed up with nuisance calls . ‘A ban on these firms would help people know a call out of the blue is one not to be trusted.’ Last year Culture Secretary Maria Miller announced plans to lower the threshold of what is considered a nuisance call – meaning ‘annoying’ as well as ‘distressing’ calls are investigated. Further measures are being drawn up to prevent cold callers being able to conceal their number and to improve the system for consumers to give their consent to be contacted. From this weekend, telephone firm TalkTalk will become the first to make all landline privacy calling features completely free, allowing families to block nusiance calls. TalkTalk CEO Dido Harding said: 'Nuisance and unwanted calls are a huge source of stress. 'It’s clear to see that customers are looking to their providers to do more to safeguard them against this menace. 'We agree and don't believe that people should be charged for the privilege of protecting their privacy. Our customers can now benefit from even more free features to help them avoid nuisance calls, helping to make TalkTalk homes even better off.' The issue was be debated in the Commons today, with Lib Dem MP Mike Crockart demanding the government take action against firms who target vulnerable people. Ahead of the debate, he said: ‘I am fed up with nuisance calls to my landline and mobile, as well as unsolicited texts. ‘And by nuisance calls I mean unwanted live marketing calls, as well as silent calls, abandoned calls, spam texts and recorded messages. I'm pestered day in, day out and I know I am not alone.’ The chairman of the all-party group on nuisance calls said he has been inundated by members of the public angry about the issue. ‘These are an annoyance for most people, but for many vulnerable and elderly people, they are also a menace, and one that puts them at risk of fraud just as much as though a crook or a pushy salesman turned up at their door.’ Culture minister Ed Vaizey said the Government was now going to bring forward legislation to make it easier for the Information Commissioner to fine rogue marketing firms which generate nuisance calls. The minister said: 'It is important that we don't throw the baby out with the bath water - that we tackle the scourge of nuisance calls, whilst also recognising that next to that is a legitimate industry doing a legitimate job. 'Make no mistake, this Government... does recognise that this is a scourge, it is a scourge where we need to make an impact and it needs to be tackled.' Last year research from Citizens Advice found 42 per cent of households received cold calls were about personal injury and accident claims, 40 per cent from gas and electricity companies, 29 per cent related to double glazing, 23 per cent debt relief services, 14 per cent for extended warranties on products and 10 per cent offering services to ‘unlock’ pensions.","Survey reveals almost no-one wants to do business with nuisance calls .

The polygamous family that stars in the TLC reality TV show 'Sister Wives' said they felt humbled and were brought to tears when they learned a federal judge in Utah has struck down key parts of the state's polygamy laws. The judge ruled in mid-December in favor of a lawsuit brought against Utah in July 2011 by Kody Brown and his four wives after they fled the state for Las Vegas under the threat of prosecution. 'The first thing I thought about was all those families that for 100 years had lived and loved in obscurity, just in secrecy,' said Kody Brown in a phone interview with the Associated Press from Las Vegas. 'Not being able to claim their family or openly love one another.' Humbled: The stars of the TLC reality TV show 'Sister Wives,' pictured, said they were humbled when a federal judge in Utah struck down key parts of the state's polygamy laws last month . Kody and his wives — Meri, Janelle, Christine and Robyn — said they hope the landmark ruling stands and enables other polygamous families in Utah to live open and free without fearing prosecution. 'It's been incredible not having to live in fear anymore and being able to fully claim who we are,' said Christine Brown, Kody's third wife. 'We wish that for every plural family out there.' The Utah attorney general's office has not yet decided if they will appeal the ruling, said spokesman Ryan Bruckman. The state's new attorney general, Sean Reyes, has been in office for less than two weeks.Jonathan Turley, the Browns' Washington, D.C.-based attorney, said he's been told Utah will appeal. He said he's eager to defend the ruling before the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. U.S. District Judge Clark Waddoups said in the decision handed down on December 13 that a provision in Utah's bigamy law forbidding cohabitation with another person violated the First Amendment, which guarantees the freedom of religion. The ruling decriminalizes polygamy, but bigamy — holding marriage licenses with multiple partners — is still illegal. Utah's law was considered stricter than the laws in 49 other states because of the cohabitation clause. If the ruling stands, Utah's law would be identical to most other states that prohibit people from having multiple marriage licenses. Legal battle: Kody Brown and his wives - Meri, Janelle, Christine and Robyn - brought the lawsuit against Utah in July 2011 after they fled the state for Las Vegas under the threat of prosecution . In most polygamous families in Utah, the man is legally married to one woman but only 'spiritually married' to the others. There are an estimated 38,000 fundamentalist Mormons who practice or believe in polygamy, most living in Utah and other Western states. Polygamy is a legacy of the early teachings of the Mormon church but has no place in modern Mormonism, church officials said in a statement. The Salt Lake City-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints abandoned polygamy in 1890 and it strictly prohibits the practice today for its 15 million members worldwide. Though some have correlated the Browns fight to decriminalize polygamy with efforts to legalize gay marriage, the Browns don't see the two as being the same. Bad reputation: One of the most infamous polygamists, Warren Jeffs, pictured, is serving a life sentence in Texas for sexually assaulting two underage girls he considered his brides . 'Though we support the choices of other people organizing their families however they choose, our argument has always been very different,' Kody Brown said. 'What we've been looking for is simply to live free and to be able to live our religion without the threat of prosecution.' The family says they never intended to challenge Utah's polygamy law in court when they decided to do the show. Janelle Brown, Kody's second wife, said they wanted to dispel the negative stereotype of polygamous families. 'We were tired of Warren Jeffs being the only image people had of polygamy,' she said. One of the most infamous polygamists, Warren Jeffs, is serving a life sentence in Texas for sexually assaulting two underage girls he considered his brides. Jeffs still rules a sect of fundamentalist Mormons on the Utah-Arizona border from jail. The Browns are now living in four new houses in a Las Vegas cul-de-sac. That's where TLC films episodes of the hit show, which debuted in 2010 with footage of the family at their house in northern Utah. But despite an arrangement that looks comfortable to many, Kody Brown said they miss living in the large house they called home in Utah. In fact, they miss Utah dearly. They said leaving the state they still consider home has left many scars for them and their children. They fled in January 2011 after local prosecutors opened a criminal bigamy investigation after the first episodes aired. They left jobs, a home designed especially for their large family and a culture they knew well. The hardest part about living in Las Vegas, they said, is not being able to worship with their fellow fundamentalist Mormons who practice or believe in polygamy. They hold worship services at home. 'We are doing the best we can in our exile,' Kody said. They hope to someday return home to Utah, but said they aren't considering that move yet. That could be the topic of a future family meeting where decisions aren't easy to reach with five heads of the households and 17 children, several who are young adults and want in on the discussion. How do they manage to keep everyone happy with the decisions? 'We do a lot of praying,' said Kody Brown, 'and a lot of negotiation.'","Kody Brown and his four wives who star in the TLC reality TV show said they felt humbled and cried when they heard the mid-December ruling .

Accusations: Tony Blair and other government officials are accused of blocking legal claims that led to the IRA obtaining Semtex which was used to enact deadly attacks . Victims of IRA bombings are threatening to sue former Prime Minister Tony Blair over claims he intervened in their efforts to secure compensation. Lawyers representing some 200 victims say the former Labour Government was involved in a deal which ended up killing off their legal action against the Libyan Government of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi - which provided the IRA with Semtex. They say Mr Blair and other Government officials may have ‘connived’ with the Gaddafi regime to block their legal claims. A spokesman for Mr Blair described the claims as ‘malicious and wrong’. At the centre of the row is a legal case brought by American victims of IRA terror attacks nearly a decade ago in the US courts, which led to in a compensation award of £1billion. The victory in the US courts led to the threat of Libyan assets being frozen in that country - just as Gaddafi was attempting to re-join the international community. The legal case was settled after US President George Bush signed a 2008 law, the Libyan Claims Resolution Act - ensuring payments to all US victims. However, Britons who had been involved in US class action were not included in the legislation, and so were denied a payout. An email published by the Sunday Telegraph yesterday showing the British government lobbied President Bush to pass the law and settle the cases. Lawyers for the British victims say it shows the Government may have been involved in excluding British victims - and accuse former ministers of ‘scandalous and perverse’ actions. Lawyers for 200 victims say Blair 'connived' with the Gaddafi regime. The former prime minister said the claims were 'malicious and wrong' Jason McCue of McCue & Partners, which is representing the victims, said: ‘It’s bad enough being a victim of Semtex bombs supplied by Libya for the Provisional IRA campaign. '[But] it’s sheer horror then to be informed that the British government and Tony Blair may have connived with Gaddafi to ensure the few brave British victims that justly sued and stood up to the dictator received no compensation from the Libyan,’ he told the Sunday Telegraph . Colin Parry, whose son Tim, 12, died when a Semtex bomb exploded in Warrington town centre, said: 'The whole thing is grubby to say the least. 'It seems to me a complete dereliction of duty on the part of the British government in looking after the rights of British citizens. The Americans managed to get compensation for their citizens.' Colin Parry (right), whose son Tim, 12, was killed by a Semtex bomb placed by the IRA criticises that British government's 'dereliction of duty' Hugh Robertson, a Foreign Office minister, said in a letter to Mr McCue that the Government had ‘lobbied the US to include UK claimants on the list of recipients’ of the payout. The email is from Sir Vincent Fean, a former ambassador to Libya, and suggested Mr Blair helped broker the agreement between Gaddafi and President Bush. It was written to Mr Blair’s aides on June 8 2008, two days before a meeting between the former prime minister and Col Gaddafi in Libya. A spokesman for Mr Blair said: ‘This persistent attempt, backed by no evidence whatever, to suggest that Tony Blair ‘interfered’ with the terms of compensation is malicious and wrong,’ she said. ‘He has never had anything to do with it and he has never discussed any such terms with President Bush. The email you reference merely expresses government policy of the time which was to reengage with the Libyans after they gave up their WMD programme and chose to cooperate rather than sponsor terrorism.’","Lawyers of 200 people claim former PM and other officials 'connived' with Gaddafi regime to block legal claims which gave IRA Semtex .

And artist Karl Baden has no plans of stopping the ongoing visual document he first thought up as a student in 1975, and which has culminated in a stunning time lapse film showing the process of aging. 'I’ll stop when I’m dead,' he told Boston Magazine. 'If I’m dead, I won’t know what will happen with [my project] from there, but the plan is to have an institution acquire it in some form.' Baden is now 61 and he started 'Every Day' - which is usually updated daily online - at 34-years-old. Scroll down for video . Karl Baden started 'Every Day' in 1987 at the age of 34 (above) At the end of the two-minute video, which encompasses 24 years worth of photos, Baden puts on glasses . The daily task is part of a decades-long examination of the role that mortality plays in people’s lives, and, more obviously, how age changes one’s appearance. Barden said it also serves as a 'meta comment' on the idea of obsession, and doing something repetitiously. 'Artists need to be obsessive to get the work that they have to get done, done,' he said. 'They have to have some inner drive to do it; this is taking it to another step. This is a comment on the obsession and obsessively making work. 'The idea of making and taking photographs has a lot to do with documenting things over time. 'Many people have attempted that in terms of looking at cities, and locations, or even one’s own family—kids growing up, that sort of thing. 'So I felt that it might be interesting to take it a step further.' The process for 'Every Day' has been something reminiscent of Groundhog Day. Baden wakes up, gets ready for work or the weekend, and then simply snaps the photo using the same camera and the same lighting that he has used for nearly three decades. The type of film has changed over time, he said, because the older products he once relied on are no longer made. 'I don’t do anything to change my face intentionally. I don’t grow beards or mustaches, and I keep my hair the same,' he said. 'I don’t use any unusual angles, and I don’t use any unusual lenses, or filters, or lighting sources. 'I try to keep all artistic conceits out of the picture. 'I try to achieve identical images, but I can’t always, because I’m human, and I make mistakes, and the camera makes mistakes. 'Those are all accepted as part of the project.' Baden said he could only remember one time that he forgot to take a portrait of himself, when he was rushing out the house to teach a class. Once he takes a photo, he collects the negatives and keeps them organized and well documented in a safe place, and brings them out when he needs to make prints, or in the case of one undertaking, he made to show the progression of age: a video.

The meerkat - named Alexander after the popular Russian critter from the TV advert - was filmed laughing with pleasure at Whitehouse Farm Centre near Morpeth, Northumberland. His keepers regularly stroke his and his fellow meerkats' stomachs - causing them to make a giggle-like sound. Scroll down for video . Cuddly critter: Alexander the meerkat, and the other meerkats he shares his space with at the Northumberland farm, love being tickled by the people who work there . Meerkats talk to eachother using a series of purrs and throat noises, that can be heard when Alexander is being tickled . Staff member Karen Lovatt said the ticklish creatures are spreading the laughter and sending visitors into stitches. She said: 'Meerkats are very vocal and they do tend to make noise. 'They all have their own character, but they all definitely like being tickled.' Whenever the keeper of the farm stops tickling, the meerkat appears to grapple them with its tiny hands, almost as if it's asking for more . Alexander the meerkat appears to be an adult sized meerkat. Infants of the species are often a lot smaller and cling to their mothers for protection . Meerkats are squirrel-sized group animals, which are part of the mongoose family. They are mostly indigenous to desert areas of Africa, and are famous for their upright posture, which they use to gaze of the plains where they live and stay alert for predators. The tunnel-dwellers have a varied diet of lizards, birds, insects and fruit, and can be trained as rodent-catchers due to their skills at hunting.","Meerkats are tunnel-dwelling animals indigenous to African plains .

Bad caretakers: Sarah Veazey (left) and her father, Robert Veazey (right), have been charged with first-degree child cruelty for allowing the woman's daughter to live in deplorable conditions with no running water . What lies beneath: Behind a tidy facade, police found Veazey's home on Favor Street to be filled to bursting with junk and smeared in animal feces . According to the Veazeys' arrest warrant cited by Atlanta Journal Constitution, the cluttered home they shared on Favor Road in Marietta was overrun with rats and smeared with feces from a dozen cats and dogs living on the premises. The residence had no running water or a working bathroom for the family to use for at least a month.

Several black students at Park Tudor School said they were hurt and disappointed when served the meal last Wednesday, supposedly in the name of raising cultural awareness. ‘We apologize for what was a clear error in judgment,’ said school officials. ‘We recognize the distress and hurt feelings this has caused within our entire community.’ Black students at Park Tudor School in Indianapolis said they were hurt and disappointed when served fried chicken last Wednesday - all in the name of raising cultural awareness . Administrators said they realized the problem before lunch was served and removed references to Black History Month from the menu, reports the Indianapolis Star. School officials blamed the menu mistake on Aladdin Food Management Services, which puts together meals without Park Tudor approval. A school official said the menu was ‘unconsciously’ linked to Black History Month by the West Virginia-based food services provider, without realizing any racist connotation. Fried chicken became ‘one of the most egregious stereotypes’ about blacks, along with watermelon, to emerge from minstrel shows, said Jakobi Williams, an Indiana University history professor.

"By . Alexandra Klausner . PUBLISHED: . 19:37 EST, 1 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 19:38 EST, 1 March 2014 . More than 20,000 people from all over the United States have asked that the Catholic Diocese in Helena, Montana reverse their decision to fire an unmarried and pregnant Middle school teacher. The social justice group Faithful America and the teacher's friends, Susan Hawthorne and Margaret Rankin, delivered a petition with 22,000 signatures to Bishop George Leo Thomas of The Roman Catholic Diocese of Helena on Thursday. The petition calls the decision to fire the pregnant teacher at Butte Central Elementary-Junior High School, Shaela Evenson, 'hypocritical.' Shaela Evenson was fired for being pregnant but has over 20,000 supporters in her fight to get her job back . Evenson was a literature and physical education teacher at the school for eight years. USA Today reports that when the diocese received an anonymous letter saying the teacher was pregnant, administrators decided to fire her not based on her merit but because her pregnancy violated their conservative Catholic belief system. 'Firing an unmarried teacher for becoming pregnant is cruel and hypocritical,' said the petition.'Give Shaela Evenson her job back, and start taking Pope Francis' words about love and healing more seriously,' it continued. Faithful America's deputy director, Aaron Villes said that the organization did not inform Evenson that they were taking action in her favor before doing so. 'This petition came from the staff of Faithful America,'Viles said Thursday. 'We saw her story and were inspired to take action.' The organization's petition holds 22,000 signatures, 7,000 more signature's than the organization's original goal of 15,000. One of Evenson's friends, Jen Hensly, started a gofundme page to raise money for her. Evenson is currently jobless and in her eight month of pregnancy. The petition with 20,000 signatures calls the decision to fire the pregnant teacher at Butte Central Elementary-Junior High School, Shaela Evenson, 'hypocritical' 'Besides being an outstanding educator and an inspiration to her young students, Shaela is in a long-term, committed relationship, said Hensly. 'This pregnancy is hard fought and very much wanted,’ she added. Moveon.org also started a petition for Evenson that boasts 900 signatures. Unfortunately, Evenson's friend Rankin doesn't believe that the petitions will have any influence on the church. 'The only way that change could be made is if (Pope) Francis himself came and asked for that change to be made, and I doubt that would happen,' Rankin told USA today. Supporters delivered the petition to Bishop Thomas' office at the chancery near the Cathedral at St.Helena but he wasn't there to collect the letter of support. Evenson was a literature and physical education teacher at the school for eight years prior to her termination . Diocese spokesman Dan Bartleson received the letter instead and said that the bishop would take their opinion into consideration. Bartleson discussed the matter with the bishop before the petition was delivered and it didn't seem like he was willing to change his opinion. 'At this time it's unlikely, right now, that he would reverse the decision that was made in Butte,' said Bartleson. Thomas told reporters that his staunch decision to terminate Evenson was partly based on Pope Francis' advice to Catholic Educators in January that asked them to, 'give uncompromising and unambiguous witness to church teaching and defend themselves from all efforts to dilute their Catholic identity.' 'I am deeply saddened by these recent events, and caught between the values of upholding the Catholic identity of our schools while desiring to provide pastoral outreach and understanding to the teacher,' said Thomas. 'At the end of the day, there are no easy answers or facile solutions,' he continued. Evenson's dismissal sparked a backlash in the community, where some Catholics pointed out that even Pope Francis has been signalling lately that unwed mothers should not be shunned by society . Evenson herself is not catholic and she and her lawyer Brian Butler are attempting to push employers and religious organizations to follow state and federal anti-discrimination laws. Brian Butler filed a discrimination charge with the Federal Equal Opportunity Commission alleging the school violated Evenson’s rights under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Evenson's dismissal sparked a backlash in the community, where some Catholics pointed out that even Pope Francis has been signalling lately that unwed mothers should not be shunned by society. Last month, the pontiff baptized a child born out of wedlock inside the Sistine Chapel, and in September, he offered an unmarried woman who had chosen not to have an abortion to personally baptize the baby. Butler also cited a case in June in which a federal jury found that the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati discriminated against a Catholic school teacher, Christa Dias, when they fired her for becoming pregnant through artificial insemination. 'These cases are nearly identical. She (Dias) was not Catholic, and she didn't teach any religion,' Butler said. 'She decided to have a child, and when the school found out she was pregnant, she was terminated.' Butler represented Dias in that case and she won $170,000. Pope Francis baptised the child of an unmarried couple (not pictured) during a ceremony in the Sistine Chapel in Rome recently .","Over 20,000 people signed a petition that was delivered to Bishop George Leo Thomas of The Roman Catholic Diocese of Helena on Thursday .

A mother-of-three is facing 60 years prison in Wisconsin for allegedly orchestrating a murder-for-hire plot to kill her fiance, offering a former classmate $1,000 plus sexual favors to carry out the crime. Jessica Strom, 33, allegedly spent two years plotting the death of her partner, lawyer John Schellpfeffer, asking a man she previously took criminal justice classes with at Northcentral Technical College to make the hit because 'he was very neat and thorough'. However the man, a licensed pilot, became a police informant and secretly recorded a conversation he had with Strom, as part of a sting that allowed investigators to charge her with conspiracy to commit first-degree homicide. The informant told police that the plot started when Strom asked him to meet in person and discuss a 'business proposal', according to police documents obtained by The Smoking Gun. Scroll down for video . Murder-for-fire: Jessica Strom (right) of Merrill, Wisconsin, is accused of offering a former classmate $1000 'and sex' to gun down her fiance, John Schellpfeffer (left). The couple are seen here in a Facebook photo . Jessica Strom is facing 60 years in prison for a charge conspiracy to commit first-degree homicide, after allegedly trying to hire a man to murder her husband . They got together at a cafe in downtown Wausau and Strom asked: 'Would you ever kill anybody?' When the pilot said no, Strom asked what it would take. Strom told the pilot that she had been . planning to kill Schellpfeffer for two years, claiming he was . 'controlling' and had 'done bad things to her and others'. 'You’re very thorough and you’re very neat and I think you would be a good person to do this for me,' she allegedly said. When the man remarked that she was in control and could 'just get out of the relationship if she wanted to', Strom replied 'that wouldn’t give her any satisfaction', investigators reported. The Wisconsin Rapids Tribune reported that Strom assured the informant the job would be easy. She said he could make a fake appointment at Schellpfeffer's office wanting advice on an adoption and even drew a diagram of the office, noting the working habits of Schellpfeffer's colleagues. She said the informant could walk in, 'blow his brains out and walk out'. She also told him to buy a gun 'off the street'. Jessica Strom appears in court in Wausau to face her chagred on Tuesday March 4, 2014 . Strom allegedly said she would do it herself but it would be too obvious. Though he had initially asked for $50,000 to kill Schellpfeffer, the informant told Strom that he would settle for $1,000. Strom is said to have replied 'and some sex'. At some point after the killing, Strom told the informant that she would meet up with him and 'pay you and f--- you and whatever'. But she warned: 'Don’t tell anyone about this. I don’t want to have to kill you too.' The man subsequently contacted the police and agreed to record a meeting with Strom. Strom’s home was raided by police after the sting operation and she was arrested for conspiracy to commit first degree murder, which carries a maximum 60-year prison term. Strom told police she was not serious about having Schellpfeffer killed, and had intended to contact the pilot the following day to call off the murder. She is being held at Marathon County Jail in Wausau, Wisconsin on a $250,000 cash bond. She briefly appeared in court today, WSAW reported.

A man who kept a swath of southeastern Michigan on edge for weeks by shooting at two-dozen vehicles along a busy highway corridor has been sentenced to 18 to 40 years in prison on a combination of terrorism and weapons convictions. Raulie Casteel, a married father, learned his fate on Monday at Livingston County Circuit Court, where a jury in January had found him guilty of terrorism, rejecting his claim that the shootings were the impulsive result of uncontrolled delusions and paranoia. Casteel, 44, is already serving a six-plus-year sentence that stemmed from a related case in neighboring Oakland County. Scroll down for video . Raluie Casteel has been sentenced to 18 to 40 years in prison on a combination of terrorism and weapons convictions after he kept a swath of southeastern Michigan on edge for weeks by shooting at two-dozen vehicles along a busy highway corridor . The judge sentenced him to a minimum of 16 years on the terrorism charge and two additional years on felony firearms charges. The sentence is concurrent with the Oakland County case, and he must serve at least 18 years. Defense lawyer Doug Mullkoff sought a lighter sentence saying his client was ‘certainly a troubled individual’ but not a terrorist. ‘Is Raulie Casteel actually a terrorist - is this really what the Legislature had in mind when it passed the Michigan anti-terrorism act in wake of attacks in 2001?’ asked Mullkoff before the sentencing. ‘I think they were thinking of Osama bin Laden, Timothy McVeigh. Did Raulie Casteel fit into that category? I don't think so. The post-9/11 law passed by Legislature did not contemplate someone who is mentally ill like Mr. Casteel.’ Defense lawyer Doug Mullkoff, left, had sought a lighter sentence for Casteel saying his client was 'certainly a troubled individual' but not a terrorist . Stalking ground: The targets in the 24 reported incidents were mostly cars traveling on roads near Interstate 96 (pictured) Before handing down his sentence, Judge David Reader said he had a mentally ill mother who he cared for up until her death and is ‘very empathetic and sympathetic’ to the condition. Still, he added, terrorism isn't necessarily contingent upon the mental state of the perpetrator. ‘The daily routines and lives of tens of thousands were affected before any motivation was revealed,’ he said, adding ‘that's indeed terror in the opinion of this court.’ During the Livingston County trial, Casteel testified that he shot at the other motorists on Interstate 96 and nearby roads between Lansing and Detroit over a three-day period in October 2012. Testifying in his own defense, Casteel said he was consumed with anxiety while in traffic, most likely from undiagnosed delusions. He said he believed drivers were part of a government conspiracy against him. Casteel said he never thought about the consequences of the shootings, only that he wanted ‘to send a message to back off.’ Casteel, a married father, said he believed drivers were part of a government conspiracy against him . Fearful: Jennifer Kupiec told the court she saw Casteel laugh after firing at her car . Among the victims who attended the sentencing was Jennifer Kupiec, who spoke at a news conference afterward. Kupiec, now 25, said she encountered Casteel on the freeway on Oct. 18, 2012, while driving from Brighton to East Lansing to meet a friend for lunch and buy a sweatshirt from Michigan State University, her alma mater. ‘Someone I didn't know rolled down their window and aimed a nine-millimeter gun at me,’ said Kupiec, who now lives in Chicago. ‘He tried to kill me for no reason and came with milliseconds of getting his wish.’ Kupiec said she pulled over and saw the bullet hole in her car door and believes Casteel was aiming at her rib cage. She said he likely would have succeeded had she not been speeding - which drew some laughs from the law enforcement officials standing around her. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette said it was a miracle nobody was hurt or killed, but argued that doesn't lessen his belief that the terrorism charge and conviction ‘squarely’ aligned with the state law. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette, center, said it was a miracle nobody was hurt or killed by Casteel during the shootings in October 2012 . ‘For three days people were intimidated - afraid to take their normal route to work... or school,’ he said. ‘They were afraid they might get shot.’ The terrorism charge brought by the state attorney general's office covered all the shootings in Livingston, Shiawassee, Ingham and Oakland counties. Casteel had faced 60 charges, including attempted murder, in Oakland County for shootings in Commerce Township and Wixom before pleading no contest but mentally ill to assault and firearms charges last year. Defense attorney Mullkoff has said his client was diagnosed with delusional disorder, a condition associated with maintaining false, persistent beliefs despite evidence to the contrary. Casteel is a St. Johns, Mich., native who lived in Taylorsville, Ky., before returning to Michigan in 2012 to live with his wife's family. Police in Kentucky said they had no contact with him until June 2012 when he became agitated and complained about aircraft flying too low over his house. No one else had reported low-flying planes.","Married father Raulie Casteel has been sentenced to 18 to 40 years in prison on a combination of terrorism and weapons convictions .

He could reveal secrets, such as claims like that of a former MP who was known to be a persistent sex pest, the liaison between a Lib Dem peer and married MP, and details of gay affairs between peers and MPs, according to the Sunday Times. A spokesman for Lord Rennard declined to comment last night. The Lib Dem peer has kept silent in the last few days, as have the women who made allegations against him. According to one source, he has a ‘little black book’ filled with many politician and activists’ darkest secrets. The Lib Dem, who did not wish to be named, said that most of in the party ‘lived in fear’ of the Svengali-like figure because their careers - and family life - depended on him. The source said: ‘He is often offered up as a shoulder to cry on so everyone has off-loaded their skeletons on to him. But he has all their dirty little secrets apparently stored in a little black book. It’s no wonder that it’s taken ten years for anyone to confront him.’ Crisis management: Lord Rennard was also at the centre of managing other Lib Dem crises such as the discovery that Mark Oaten (left) had hired a rent boy and the extra-marital affairs of Lord Ashdown (right) Lord Rennard was also at the centre of . managing other Lib Dem crises such as the discovery that former MP Mark .

Not worried: Sources close to party leader Nick Clegg have called fears that Lord Rennard 'could go nuclear' a 'grubby threat' Plans for a second inquiry might be . dropped if Lord Rennard apologises but he will only do so if any threat . of legal action by the complainants is dropped. Mr Clegg’s leadership faced a fresh crisis last week after revelations that Portsmouth South MP Mike Hancock sexually harassed a vulnerable constituent. Mr Clegg said the first he knew about the crisis was when he saw a report by an independent QC into the claims. There is no sign yet of the crisis abating. Yesterday (SUN), senior Lib Dem councillor in Portsmouth, Eleanor Scott,  quit the party group over the way it had handled the affair. She has represented Fratton, the same ward as Mr Hancock, since 2002. Cllr Scott told the Mail she had quit the Lib Dem group of councillors on Portsmouth City Council. She added: ‘I remain a Liberal Democrat Party member, and committed to being a councillor and Portsmouth. ‘I hope that others involved in the Group’s decision On Friday will reflect on their positions, and do the right thing. ‘We need to run a city, not a game show. Cllr Scott added: ‘I have previously raised concerns with Liberal Democrat Party headquarters in London, and I trust that they will concede that they need to give me, and others here, support to clean out the Augean Stables.’","Liberal Democrat peer has denied allegations of sexual harassment .

Republican Alan Grayson has sent out an email for his re-election campaign in which he says people are sick of the Tea Party's tactics . A Democrat Congressman has compared the Tea Party to the Ku Klux Klan in an attack on right wing politics as part of a fund-raising campaign. Republican Alan Grayson has sent out an email for his re-election campaign in which he says people are sick of the Tea Party's tactics. 'At this point, the Tea Party is no more popular than the Klan,' he says, a catchphrase that was used by his campaign group to tag a link to his comment on Twitter and elsewhere online. Grayson, who represents Florida’s Ninth Congressional District that includes Orlando, Kissimmee and St. Cloud, shared his transcribed interview with talk-show host and Democrat Rev. Al Sharpton, on last week's MSNBC’s 'PoliticsNation with Al Sharpton'. At the top of the email he attached a picture of KKK members watching a burning cross at night, with the words Tea Party written in flames. The flaming cross represents the 'T'. When asked if he think the President has the Tea Party 'on the ropes', Grayson replied: 'I think so. I think that ordinary Americans are with the President. They’re appalled by the Tea Party’s tactics. They come to the President saying, “If you don’t let us steal your car, then, we are going to burn down your house.” 'They are appalled by the way the Tea Party cheered on the shutting down of the government, cheered at the fact that we put our credit at risk for a generation to come. 'And they’re appalled by the enormous expense - the fact that this temporary shutdown ended up costing America $24 billion. That’s almost $100 for every man, woman, and child in this country. 'Frankly, they want their money back, and the Tea Party out of their lives. At this point, the Tea Party is no more popular than the Klan.' The Congressman's campaign group also shared his comments on Twitter. Grayson's campaign team sent the email of his interview with chat show host Al Sharpton accompanied by the above picture . The Congressman said the Tea Party is now as popular as the Klan. Pictured, a member of the American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan at a rally in Boonville, Indiana . He goes on to say he thinks the Tea Party is on its way out. 'The Republican Party is going to go the way of the Whig Party, the way the Whig Party disappeared in the 1830s in America. And the reason is simple. They simply won’t do anything useful for ordinary people. 'Whether the issue is jobs or housing or health care or transportation, whatever the issue might be, they got nothing.' In the wake of the debt ceiling controversy which saw the US government stalled by lack of consensus over its budget, Grayson has also said he thinks House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, 'has to go'. He said the Republican catered to the Tea Party and therefore ignored the interests of US citizens. According to ABC News, it is not the first time Grayson, 55, has made controversial public remarks. In 2009, he called a senior Federal Reserve advisor a 'K Street Whore'. He also said of the Republican GOP healthcare proposal: If you get sick America, the Republican health care plan is this: Die quickly.'","Republican Alan Grayson claims people are sick of the Tea Party's tactics .

Its $310 tasting menu makes Per Se one of New York City's most expensive restaurants, but its C grade from health inspectors puts it near the bottom of the heap when it comes to sanitary violations. Three Michelin-starred Per Se got 42 violation points when it was inspected February 19, city health department records showed. Infractions included failure to hold hot food at 140 degrees and a lack of a hand-washing facility near the food preparation area. Per Se representatives did not immediately return a call seeking comment about the lowest possible grade, but the restaurant will have a chance to argue its case at a hearing. Until then it must post a sign saying its grade is pending.

The violations also also included failure to hold cold food below 41 degrees, eating or drinking in the food-prep area and tobacco use, according to the New York Post. City records indicate that Per Se has received more than 40 violations in the past. The 10-year-old Per Se is the East Coast outlet of Thomas Keller's French Laundry in Yountville, California. Per Se is one of only seven New York City restaurants to earn three Michelin stars, and The New York Times called it the city's best restaurant in 2011.

Late last year, Mayor Bloomberg called for a boycott all 4,500 restaurants with a B, C, or Grade Pending rating in an effort to force the eateries to shape up or get out. In 2012, the Post reported that the vaunted eatery avoided having to post the B grade it received with a 'well-placed call' to the Health Department. The city reportedly 'accepted Per Se’s explanation' at the time that the inspector was in error with his grading and they were given in A.

An 81-year-old Florida woman has been jailed indefinitely pending a mental evaluation after being caught repeatedly feeding wild animals. Mary Musselman, a retired gym teacher from Sebring in Highlands County, will be kept behind bars for violating the terms of her probation, a judge ordered Tuesday morning, according to Fox 13. Musselman has a history of run-ins with wildlife officers and police over feeding bears in and near her backyard. She is accused of leaving out up to 18 bowls of dog food for one to three bears at a time. Scroll down for video . Elderly Florida woman Mary Musselman has been ordered to undergo a mental evaluation after refusing to stop feeding wild animals in her backyard, which officials say is dangerous to the community . Mary Musselman seen here appearing in court last month looking frail. She agreed to an order saying she will not feed wild animals, specifically bears, but was then allegedly caught leaving bread out for crows . Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission officials believe feeding bears results in the animals losing their fear of humans and actively try to stop it, ABC Action News reported. The officials became aware that Musselman, a fierce animal lover, was feeding a single bear and claim to have 'gone the extra mile' to educate her against it. They dropped off videos and pamphlets and would routinely call past her home. 'She told us she wasn't going to stop,' Gary Morse, FWC spokesperson told ABC Action News. Musselman was issued a warning on November 8, but continued feeding the bear. FWC officers went back to her property on November 19 and reported that Musselman was feeding two more bears. They gave her more educational videos. On December 4 she was issued with a court notice for December 6.

Wildlife officials say it is dangerous to feed wild bears because it stops their fear of humans . The judge ordered her to stop feeding all wild animals and FWC officers were ordered to check on her residence weekly. According to FWC officers, on December 24, Musselman again appeared in court and admitted feeding two to three bears large amounts of food. 'We are talking about putting out as many as 17 or 18 bowls of dog food,' Morse explained. A judge found her guilty of two counts of feeding wildlife and was placed on probation for one year. On December 29, FWC officers say they found evidence Musselman was continuing to feed bears. A judge then ordered FWC officers to arrest her. According to Morse, when FWC officers arrested Musselman, she threatened to kill the officers and resisted. 'She didn't want to accept that fact that they'd be fine without her...they hibernate when there is no food,' Morse added. Mary Musselman, 81, a retired gym teacher, reportedly suffers from dementia . After spending a week in jail, Musselman was released on bond and ordered to appear in court on March 3. However on January 31, officers issued a new arrest after visiting her home and seeing that food had been left out. Musselman's attorney, William Fletcher, said that it was bread left out for crows. However police said that still violated Musselman's court order not to feed any wild animals. Musselman appeared in court today looking frail. Fletcher said a medical evaluation concluded that she suffers from Alzheimer's and dementia, and he requested that the judge place her in alternate housing, such as her brother's home in Illinois. The judge, however, said he wanted a more complete mental evaluation and ordered Musselman to be held in a secure facility until then, so she will remain behind bars.","Mary Musselman, 81, is a retired gym teacher who lives alone in Sebring, Florida .

The Mail on Sunday has found that Radio 4 Today presenter Sarah Montague, economics editor Stephanie Flanders and Radio 5 Live chief political correspondent John Pienaar have agreed four and five-figure fees to officiate at events held by the NHS, the European Commission and the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, which represents accountants in Whitehall and local government. Money spinner: BBC economics editor Stephanie Flanders, left, and Radio Four presenter Sarah Montague, pictured right at an NHS conference, have been earning outside earnings holding events for corporate clients . Critics say this moonlighting could affect the trio’s ability to report impartially because they are receiving money from some of the institutions they cover. Last night, Tory MP Alun Cairns called for a register where BBC journalists would declare all outside earnings. He said: ‘Well-known journalists are often asked to attend these conferences for money. That potentially establishes an unhealthy relationship.’ BBC rules state that anyone signing up to a speaking agency must have written permission from their head of department and that each engagement is examined case by case. But, with dozens of BBC employees being . offered lucrative opportunities each month, insiders admit the system is . difficult to police. Lucrative: BBC Radio Five Live presenter John Pienaar is a regular on the after-dinner speaking circuit . Ms Montague is understood to have been paid five figures this month for chairing events at an NHS conference, while Ms Flanders, who according to agency JLA charges up to £25,000 per event, pulled out of a European Commission debate on June 19 after MoS enquiries.

A woman in West Yorkshire has been revealed as the worst driving instructor in the country (file picture) A whopping 143 of these tests were ‘fails’ – with only 26 learners scoring ‘passes’. Three other people in West Yorkshire are also ranked among Britain’s top 12 worst driving instructors, according to figures revealed by a Freedom of Information request to the Driving Standards Agency (DSA). A male instructor in the region has achieved only a 23 per cent rate – less than half the national average of 47.1 per cent. The unnamed man has recorded just 33 passes out of 145 practical tests between April 2010 and March 2013 – with one student failing the exam a soul-destroying 17 times under his tuition. Earlier this year, five women in the small West Yorkshire town of Heckmondwike, pictured - which has a population of about 17,000 people - were revealed to be among the top 20 worst learner drivers in the UK . Meanwhile, two other female instructors have each taught an individual who failed their practical driving test an unimaginably high number of times (19 and 17 times respectively). Earlier this year, five women in the small West Yorkshire town of Heckmondwike - which has a population of about 17,000 people - were revealed to be among the top 20 worst learner drivers in the UK. The unnamed women, aged between 35 and 48, had taken a staggering 158 practical driving tests between them - forking out almost £10,000 trying to pass. One determined woman in the town took 34 attempts to succeed, while two unnamed learners took 32 tests. Three other people in the region are also ranked among Britain's top 12 worst driving instructors (file picture) The other two women struggled through 29 . practical driving tests before passing on their 30th attempts – . contributing to the rural town’s extremely low driving pass rate of 39.8 . per cent. It is believed the women’s lack of success could have been down to Heckmondwike's narrow, rural roads, bad surfaces and busy junctions. Driving test routes in the area also feature the notorious Gildersome Roundabout, deemed the most dangerous roundabout in the region. However, four other people in West Yorkshire were also ranked among the top 20 worst learners in the country. Two learner drivers from Bradford – a man and a woman, both in their 40s - took 30 attempts to pass the practical driving test, while a 29-year-old woman took a slightly more embarrassing 31 exams. And a 51-year-old female from Horsforth, Leeds, took a pricey 32 attempts to pass. The practical driving test, which lasts about 40 minutes, costs £62 to take on a weekday or £75 on an evening, weekend or bank holiday. The DSA says, on average, it takes about 45 hours of professional training and 22 hours of private practice to pass the exam. A DSA spokesman said: The pass rate of a driving instructor is no reflection of their teaching standard. 'Instructors may not have trained the candidate but only presented them for the test. Others focus on training candidates who have difficulty in learning to drive. 'All registered Approved Driving Instructors (ADI) must pass extensive tests to meet the high standards set by the Driving and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) before giving professional tuition, and are subject to regular checks throughout their career.' Other unsuccessful driving instructors in the UK include a Hampshire man who has achieved only a 17 per cent pass rate, and a male instructor from Manchester who has seen a student fail 18 practical driving tests under his tuition.","Female instructor has 15 per cent pass rate - with 143 fails and 26 successes .

He was convicted in his absence in January last year at Sheffield Crown Court and was sentenced to 18 years in jail . A British drugs baron sentenced to 18 years in jail for his role in smuggling heroin into the UK has been arrested by armed officers in Spain. David Mather, 52, from Salford, Greater Manchester, will now be extradited back to the UK where he will serve his sentence for conspiracy to import heroin. Armed officers for the National Crime Agency (NCA) - dubbed the British FBI - and the Spanish National Police halted Mather as he drove through La Linea, close to the border with Gibraltar. He was convicted in his absence in January last year at Sheffield Crown Court and was sentenced to 18 years in jail. His arrest comes as part of Operation Captura Unlucky 13, a campaign to track down convicted criminals who have fled abroad to avoid justice. Hank Cole, head of international operations for the NCA, said: 'This arrest is a result of close working with the Spanish authorities. 'Mather was using false identity documents to try and evade capture but we were able to track him down. 'It demonstrates the NCA and its partners have the capability to pursue fugitives wherever they are in the world.' Lord Ashcroft, founder and chairman of Crimestoppers, said: 'The charity is obviously delighted by this latest arrest as this is the second Operation Captura subject to have been located since the turn of the year, which is a great result. 'David Mather has been convicted in his absence and will now have to come back to the UK to serve his sentence. The National Crime Agency (NCA) was founded in October 2013 and employs roughly 4,000 officers to tackle serious and organised crime (file photo) 'We hope that this arrest will once again highlight that Crimestoppers, the NCA and our colleagues in Spain will not rest until wanted individuals are caught and brought to justice.' A freight company owned by Mather was involved in the logistics and movement of a lorry that was stopped at Humber Sea Terminal in May 2010 with 32 wrapped packages of heroin found in the bumper. It is believed the vehicle had been used on a number of occasions to import similar amounts of drugs into the UK. Mather's picture was released in November last year as part of a list of 13 of Britain's most wanted criminals thought to be hiding in Spain. The list was published as part of Operation Captura, a scheme to trace criminals who are thought to have fled to Spain. Mather’s arrest means 58 out of 76 wanted individuals targeted since Operation Captura was launched have been caught.

A blackmailer who repeatedly raped a Muslim woman and pocketed her life savings after threatening to publish lingerie photos of her has been jailed for 17 years. Unemployed electrical engineer Daood Hussain demanded £10,000 from the woman or he would publish the pictures and advertise her as a prostitute. The 28-year-old was described at Birmingham Crown Court as a man who wanted control and would not take no for an answer. Judge Peter Carr told Hussain: 'You treated her, on the evidence that I have heard, in a demeaning and degrading fashion and with complete contempt. 'The prosecution were right in their submission to the jury in that you were a man who wanted control and you were not going to take no for an answer from her. 'You also made a demand for £10,000 which she paid.' The judge said the effects of releasing the photos would be 'potentially devastating' on the victim and her family. Following a trial, Bordesley, Birmingham, was found guilty of blackmail and 12 charges of rape. As well as the long prison sentence, he was ordered to register as a sex offender for an indefinite period and was banned from contacting the woman or her family on his release. In a police interview, the woman said Hussain had demanded a meeting during the summer of 2012.

Mr Fairburn has started making more works inspired by America, and already has paintings hanging in a gallery in Denver, Colorado.

The mother of a 16-year-old boy has described the heartbreaking moment she held her son in her arms as he died following an ecstasy overdose. Fiona Spargo-Mabbs, 46, said her son Daniel's death was 'so peaceful', adding that her family had been able to say goodbye to the aspiring soldier, rather than him being killed in an explosion in Afghanistan. The teenager fell ill after taking ecstasy at a rave . in Hayes, west London, in the early hours of Saturday and, despite . hospital treatment, died on Monday in the arms of his mother. Heartbroken: Fiona Spargo-Mabbs, 46, (right) has described the devastating moment she held her teenage son Daniel (left) in her arms as he died after taking a fatal dose of ecstasy at a rave . 'He could have gone to Afghanistan and been blown to smithereens, but I got to hold him while he died,' said Mrs Spargo-Mabbs. 'It was so peaceful and we all got to say goodbye and we were all with him.' The mother-of-two said that before Daniel's death her family had seen the negative effects of drugs through a relative who had battled addiction, and warned other parents not to be naive about their children taking illegal substances. 'We have seen at first hand the effect of addiction and the knock-on effect on the wider family, and he knew what that looked like,' she said. 'We told him just don’t even do it once. You just don’t know if that’s going to be you. But Daniel would have known people that would have done it and said it was amazing. Tragedy: Daniel fell ill after taking ecstasy at a rave in Hayes, west London, in the early hours of Saturday and, despite hospital treatment, died on Monday in the arms of his mother . 'However good they are and however . much you think you know what they might be aware of, if you’ve got a . teenager they will know people who have taken drugs. And it’s . frighteningly cheap, it’s pocket money.' She has been told that Daniel spent £20 on the drug, which was soluble in water. Daniel's . parents have left his bed unmade in his bedroom at their home in . Croydon, south London, which has a collage of photographs stuck to the . walls and a Prom King certificate from last summer. His father Tim opens and closes the curtains each day. He said: 'He is never coming back. Nobody is ever going to sleep in that bed again, he will never enter this house again. 'What used to be a lively vibrant room is now still and empty and quiet. It’s just awful.' The couple, who also have an 18-year-old son, Jacob, said they have had messages of support from all over the world including Australia, Cambodia, India and the United States, and hope to raise awareness of the dangers of drug-taking. Fantastic boy: Mrs Spargo-Mabbs said her son was a 'good kid with a sense of adventure' Adult education manager Mrs . Spargo-Mabbs said: 'I always thought Dan could change the world. He was . an amazing boy and I always thought he was going to do amazing things. 'If . something good can come from this awful thing and if something amazing . can come from this awful thing then that would be Dan, he would be so . behind us doing this.' Keen guitar player Daniel was passionate about political issues and often asked his mother her opinions. Mrs . Spargo-Mabbs said: 'He was a good kid and he had never done this . before. He was a good kid with a sense of adventure and he would have . thought that this was going to be an amazing experience. He didn’t think . it would be him. 'If it can happen to him, it can happen to any good kid across the land' Fiona Spargo-Mabbs . 'If it can happen to him, it can happen to any good kid across the land. 'He was just such a fantastic boy and he was such an active part of our lives and we just feel so incredibly blessed to have had him in our lives for getting on for 17 years. He really was special. We had him all that time and we might not have had him at all.' He was also keen to help his parents in the house and had taken up photography with his father. Mr Spargo-Mabbs, who works with people with learning disabilities, treasures a memory of the two of them walking in Cumbria, when he took a photo of Daniel being soaked by a sheepdog. His wife made a point of hugging and kissing her sons each time they left the house, after she heard the mother of murdered Jimmy Mizen mention the comfort she got from their final goodbye. Mrs Spargo-Mabbs said: 'He knew that I loved him and I know that he loved me. Every time he texted me, he always put two little kisses at the end. 'I feel so thankful to Margaret Mizen for giving that to me after her awful tragedy.' Two men have been charged with being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs following Daniel’s death.

It's Pancake Day today when many children will be having fun in the kitchen, mixing and frying batter and enjoying the fruits of their labours. But this family activity doesn't have to be limited to one day a year. Stroud schoolboy Tom Barlow-Kay started cooking when he was nine after being inspired by watching his parents whip up meals from scratch. By the tender age of 12, he was crowned Junior MasterChef champion 2012, beating 32 other contestants and impressing judges with his delicious dishes. Scroll down for video . Here's one I made earlier: Junior MasterChef champion and his zingy meatballs . Getting stuck in: Tom was inspired to take up cooking at the age of nine after watching his parents in the kitchen . Now Tom is keen to encourage children to get into the kitchen . to have fun, learn about new foods and discover if, like him, they have a . talent for cooking. While many children love baking . cookies and fairy cakes, Tom says children's culinary ventures don't have to be limited to creating sweet treats. While making pancakes on Shrove Tuesday is a great place to start, Tom said there are a number of other dishes children can create with minimal fuss. One of them is his 'Zingy Meatball' recipe which he created after being inspired by the film Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs 2. He . said: 'I love making new recipes and this is one other children can do . with their parents at home. I served them with salsa and they love and . taste great.' Tom said one of his favourite things about cooking is watching people's reactions when they taste his food. Fiona Hamilton-Fairley, founder of The Kids' Cookery School, said that getting children to help out in the kitchen is an excellent way to build their confidence in new skills and . get them interested in healthy food. She told MailOnline: 'Children are more likely to eat a dish or meal if they have had a . hand in it, so let them help out in the kitchen even if it is only doing . something small and not dangerous. Allow them to explore the . ingredients and learn from them.' Like Tom, Fiona said parents shouldn't feel limited to just baking with their little ones. Don't just do it on Pancake Day: Getting children cooking and baking all year round is a great way to help them learn a new skill and learn about healthy eating (posed by models) She recommends finding unusual fruit and . vegetables at the supermarket and finding new ways to prepare and cook them to make healthy eating more appealing. She said: 'Try not to always make the same . thing and try and keep away from the very sweet things. Savoury dishes . are just as much fun to prepare and make as sweet biscuits, cakes and . desserts, and of course much healthier to eat.' She also advises letting the child 'be creative in the kitchen and put their own . stamp on the food'. She explained: 'This makes them happy and empowers them to eat and . explore food further.' This was the case for Tom and now he hopes to be a full-time chef when he leaves school - watch out Jamie Oliver. Mix it up: The recipe is simple to follow .

Robinson has previously served time in jail for using someone else’s passport to travel to the United States. He was given 10 months at Southwark Crown Court in January 2013 after admitting possession of a false identity document with improper intention. During the course of last year he also had a series of brushes with the law when police tried to restrict marches by the EDL in the wake of the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby. Robinson, who also has convictions for assault, drug and public order offences, quit the group in October, claiming he had concerns over far-right extremism. Since leaving the far right group he has pledged to help tackle racism in Britain, and prior to his sentencing had been due to embark on a tour of schools, lecturing pupils on tolerance.

A state university in Alabama has enforced a strict rule forbidding its new president from hosting romantic relationships in her campus home. Alabama State University President Gwendolyn Boyd is a single woman, and as long as she is not married, she may not bring dates or even boyfriends back to her home--she even signed a contract on January 2. The contract states that the university will pay her $300,000 per year, she will get a car, and the residence she is required to live in 'to preserve the campus spirit.' Elizabeth Boyd has a new job equipped with $300,00 a year, a car, and campus residence with one caveat--she can't have an unmarried  romantic relationship . Boyd, an alumni of Alabama state University and Yale graduate school, will begin working on February 1 and she says she doesn't mind the campus rule, reported the Birmingham News. 'For so long as Dr. Boyd is President and a single person, she shall not be allowed to co-habitate in the President’s residence with any person with whom she has a romantic relation,' the contract states. 'I do live alone, so it was not problematic for me,' Boyd told Inside Higher Ed. However, there is dispute between lawyers over whether or not the State of Alabama or any state is allowed to infringe on liberties related to someone's residence. 'I don’t know of any state that has the right to invade someone’s residence even if the state owns that residence,' Washington D.C. lawyer Raymond D. Cotton told the publication. 'To convey that residence and dictate what kind of romantic relationship you can have in that facility – I mean, she’s not in prison.' The university spokesperson Kenneth Mullinax responded to criticism by saying, 'The contract was negotiated between Dr. Gwendolyn Boyd and the Alabama State University Board of Trustees and both parties agreed to it and have no problem with it.' Inside Higher Ed reports that while the restrictions in Boyd's contract are unusual, they are not 'unheard of.' Dr. Gwendolyn Boyd greets Alabama Governor Robert Bentley after the Alabama State University Board of Trustees offered her the presidency . Inside Higher Ed spoke to Scott Miller, the president of Bethany College in West Virginia who said of the rules, 'Mostly they reflect the increasing scrutiny that campus CEO’s face as the chief image-makers -- indeed, the living ‘brand’ -- of the institutions that employ the, ' Miller said . Boyd is coming from John's Hopkins University where she spent at Johns Hopkins University. She worked as an engineer and an executive assistant it the applied science laboratory. Inside Higher Ed reports that Alabama State University is not new to controversy and was audited by the governor's office for 'services that were not delivered' and 'payments to family and friends of board members.' The University is suing the auditing firm. The University started getting attention was a new president took office in fall 2012 and was paid $685,000 to resign after less than three months of working. Boyd will replace William H. Harris, the interim president. As for enforcing the rule, lawyer Scott Cotton joked, ' No board that I know of, certainly that I would advise, would have anything to do with a clause like this. How would you enforce it? Would you go marching into a president’s home and say, ‘Stop that, get your hands off him or her!’ Controversy: The University of Alabama has been audited recently and also asked a former president to resign less than three months of him completing his term .","New president Gwendolyn Boyd signed a contract saying she wouldn't co-habitate with a romantic relationship so long as she wasn't married .

Special Correspondent Alex Crawford said: 'She was alone, chased from her home and pregnant after rape, trying to give birth to another.

'It was a brutal birth to a baby boy she never wanted, into a dangerously chaotic and unstable country.' Save the Children has serious concerns about the potential for a disease outbreak in the Central African Republic (CAR), where nearly 800,000 people have been displaced by the continuing violence. Humanitarian agencies including Save the Children are trying to meet their health, food and protection needs, but a highly unstable security situation and lack of funds are hampering relief efforts. Tom Godfrey, Save the Children’s Operations Director in CAR, says: 'The situation in the IDP camps, particularly Bangui where there has been heavy fighting over the last week, is extremely concerning. 'The stench of sewage is heavy in the air and we are worried about the potential for disease to spread. With tens of thousands of people living in close quarters with little or no shelter, an epidemic could spread like wildfire.' 'When the little boy was finally delivered he was not breathing although he was successfully resuscitated by the midwives .

Central African transitional parliament chief (CNT) Alexandre-Ferdinand Nguendet, acting as Central African Republic's interim president, receives a salute from a soldier prior to a speech to former members of the Central African Army Forces (FARCA) Djotodia came under mounting international criticism after his government failed to stem unprecedented levels of violence between the country's Christian and Muslim communities. More than 1,000 people were killed in December alone, and the fighting prompted nearly 1 million people to flee their homes. 'The pillaging and the chaos are over,' Nguendet told police officers on Monday, while encouraging them to retake their posts. 'I'm calling for your help in re-establishing security across all of Central African Republic.' Babacar Gaye, the U.N. special representative to the Central African Republic, told reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York by video conference from Bangui that the country is 'at a critical stage.' 'Today ... hope is within grasp, but not yet within our hands,' he said. Gaye said that hope lies in the reinforcement of the African force that is waiting for a contingent from Rwanda, in the continued operation of French forces, and on the election of a new president. He said the U.N. is 'confident' that a new head of state will be elected within 15 days as required, and possibly earlier. 'And my hope is that the nomination of the prime minister and of the government will reinforce this hope,' he said.

'But today people in Bangui can die because of their religious belief, because of their clothing style, or just because of their physical appearance,' he said. Last year's coup plunged the deeply impoverished country into a state of near-anarchy where the top rebel leaders who took over the government exerted little control over their fighters in the streets. Many of the security forces loyal to ousted President Francois Bozize fled, leaving the rebels in charge of Bangui. A rapid intervention team made up of 400 officers was put in place Monday and will work alongside the French troops and African peacekeepers, he said.

While Djotodia's departure was met with jubilation in the streets, retaliatory violence continues. Antoine Mbao-Bogo, president of the local Red Cross, said late Monday his organization had recorded 39 deaths and 27 injuries in Bangui since Friday, noting that most of the victims were civilians. Central African Republic's woes began as a political crisis, but the conflict turned sectarian as resentment grew toward Djotodia's mostly Muslim fighters in this predominantly Christian country. As . Djotodia's rule crumbled, Christian militias began hunting down and killing those they accused of collaborating with the Muslim fighters who had killed, raped and robbed civilians. The country's national transitional council had rubber-stamped Djotodia's leadership last year after he seized power and now faces the task of choosing someone who can guide the country toward elections that are scheduled to be held before the end of the year. Already, though, there are doubts about how that can take place, given that voter rolls and administrative buildings across the country were looted and destroyed during the rebellion.","The 16-year-old was raped after being chased from her home by the Seleka .

Most people would love to take a tour of a coral reef or speed past fish on holiday, but snorkelling can be slow and difficult to master. Now a Norwegian sailing fanatic has found a new way to travel underwater with the agility and grace of a dolphin. Simon Sivertsen has created a clever device with two wings that is towed along by a boat to enable a person to be pulled along underwater while twisting, turning and performing acrobatics. A Norwegian sailing fanatic has found a new way to travel underwater with the agility and grace of a dolphin . The Subwing consists of two separate wings connected in a rotatable swivel. By grabbing the grip on each wing, it can easily be controlled in all directions. Users can tilt both wings downwards to dive, and upwards to resurface. If attempting a roll, a person twists the wings in opposite directions. The company says that controlling the Subwing is easy to learn and comes naturally to many first- timers. For more experienced SUBWING users, a single hand grip is mounted between the wings at the rear. This grip is designed to be used when equalising ear pressure and when one hand is needed. The device must be towed behind a boat. Water is about 800 times denser than air and therefore high speeds are not necessary to achieve what feels like a fast speed under water. The company recommends a towing speed around 2-4 knots, (2.3mph to 4.6mph) which can be achieved by a boat with a small motor. The 20-year-old came up with the idea for Subwing in 2010 during a sailing trip to the Mediterranean. The device is attached to a boat by Dyneema rope - the world's strongest rope – and features two wings which can be rotated individually to control movement. By twisting them in certain ways, users can perform acrobatics, including spinning. By holding onto these wings the user is pulled along at anything from two to four knots, (2.3mph to 4.6mph with a scuba mask being the only other piece of gear required to create a sense of underwater flying. A deep breath is needed but Subwing users . can surface for breath when they like and manoeuvre the device by . pointing its wings in the direction in which they wish to travel. Because of the way the ropes are attached . to the wings, a force balance between the user and the tow ropes is . created, which reduces the energy required to operate the device and . allows divers to hold their breath for longer, the company said. The Subwing (pictured) has two wings and is connected by a flexible component that allows the device to be twisted so that users can steer and perform tricks . The device costs $490 for the basic model, with the ultimate 'carbon glossy' version priced at $895 . Beginners will typically spend between 10 and 15 seconds underwater at a time, diving to around three metres - but with more training and practice users can go much deeper and for longer. The carbon wings' hollow design and foam . filling allows the Subwing to float when it is not being towed some 10 . to 12 metres behind a speed boat.

Mr Sivertsen conceived the idea on a sailing trip when he was 18. ‘When sailing through the Greek islands, I was astounded by the clarity of the water, it almost felt like flying when diving, just missing the speed and thrill,’ he write on the company’s website. ‘The first ideas of an underwater wing, towed behind a boat, started emerging deep in the right hemisphere of my brain. A deep breath is needed but Subwing users can surface for breath when they like and manoeuvre the device by pointing its wings in the direction in which they wish to travel . He first tested his idea with a piece of driftwood and a water ski rope. ‘The idea worked and I was able to control the up/downward moment without too much effort. But it was far from perfect and felt somewhat static, like a 2D videogame, it was missing a third dimension,’ he said. The idea evolved into a design with two separate wings connected with a twistable joint and after a number of DIY prototypes made from items from a hardware shop in Italy, he knew the idea could be turned into a  product and put the sailing trip on hold to create the product.

China's Jade Rabbit Moon rover is experiencing mechanical problems and may not be able to finish its mission. The six-wheeled Yutu vehicle began operating last month after making the first soft landing on the moon by a space probe in 37 years. It was designed to roam the lunar surface for three months while surveying for natural resources and sending back data, along with its stationary lander, Chang'e 3. The soft-landing of the Chang'e 3 lander in December made China the third country to complete a lunar rover mission after the United States and Russia . The mission has been a popular success for China's space programme and the rover has attracted more than 150,000 followers on its microblog. It last posted on Saturday saying repairs were underway and hope was not lost. ‘Sorry to make you all sad. The engineers and I haven't given up yet,’ the posting said. News of the rover's troubles were splashed across Chinese newspapers on Monday and even featured at the Foreign Ministry's daily briefing. The sky over the Moon appears inky black in this picture showing the Jade Rabbit rover trundling across the lunar surface taken from the Chang'e 3 lander . The potential to extract the moon's resources has been touted as a key reason behind Beijing's space programme. The moon is believed to hold uranium, titanium, and other mineral resources, as well as offering the possibility of solar power generation. 'China wants to go to the moon for geostrategic reasons and domestic legitimacy,' said China space expert Joan Johnson-Freese, a professor of national security affairs at the U.S. Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island. 'With the U.S. exploration moribund at best, that opens a window for China to be perceived as the global technology leader - though the U.S. still has more, and more advanced, assets in space.' The problems appeared to be related to the solar-powered probe's process for shutting down for the lunar night, which lasts more than two weeks. The temperature during that time drops to minus 180 °C. The probe had survived its first shutdown, during which it is unable to generate energy from its solar panels and relies on a radioactive power source to keep its delicate sensors and other equipment intact. The rover was traversing a relatively flat part of the moon known as Sinus Iridum, or the Bay of Rainbows, at a speed of 200 yards per hour. The landing vehicle, which has already shut down for the lunar night, is designed to conduct scientific examinations for one year. Online speculation focused on the possibility of lunar dust having blocked one of the solar panels from folding inward, leaving equipment exposed to the dangerously low temperatures.

The six-wheeled Yutu vehicle began operating last month after making the first soft landing on the moon by a space probe in 37 years . It will not be known if the probe is able to function again until after the two-week break. China's space programme has made steady progress since the country launched its first manned spacecraft in 2003. It has launched a lunar orbiter, conducted space walks, and put into orbit a prototype space station, to be replaced by a permanent station at the end of the decade. Already a source of enormous national pride, the programme has increasingly sought to connect with the public through social media and educational outreach. China's second woman in space, Wang Yaping, conducted China's first space classroom to students nationwide from the prototype space station, the Tiangong.

A Palestinian ambassador was killed when an office safe that had been sealed for at least 30 years exploded when he opened it. Ambassador Jamel al-Jamal, 56, was at home with his wife in the capital, Prague, at the time of the explosion, according to Palestinian Embassy spokesman Nabil El-Fahel. The 56-year-old became the ambassador to the Czech Republic only two months ago. Police said an explosive device might have been part of a security mechanism. Mr al-Jamal was seriously injured and died in hospital. Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki said no foul play was suspected, noting that the safe hadn’t been opened in at least 30 years. It also appeared that the door of the safe had been booby-trapped, according to police spokeswoman Andrea Zoulova . It was unclear how Mr al-Jamal tried to open it or what type of safe it was. The safe was recently moved from the old embassy building, but it had come from a building that used to house the Palestinian Liberation Organization's (PLO) offices in the 1980s, Malki said. He added: 'The ambassador decided to open it. He opened it and asked his wife to bring . a paper and a pen to write down the contents of the safe. 'She left him . to bring (the) pen and paper. During that time, she heard the sound of . an explosion.' He said the ambassador had taken some of the contents out of the safe but it was not immediately clear what was inside. It was also unclear how soon the explosion happened after he opened the safe. However, police later confirmed weapons were also discovered in the property. They would not say what kind of weapons or give an idea of quantities. Scene: The Palestinian ambassador to the Czech Republic died after an explosion at his apartment in Prague .

Screenwriter John Ridley has denied that he is feuding with 12 Years A Slave director Steve McQueen even though they omitted each other from their Oscars speeches. When asked if the omission was purposeful, Ridley said: 'Of course not. I had less than two minutes to thank everybody, and I was so caught up in the emotion of the moment when I was onstage,' he told The New York Post at the Vanity Fair afterparty. Despite Ridley's reassurances, inside sources have confirmed that McQueen is bitter because he asked to share the writing credit for the film and Ridley denied him.

Ridley returned the favor by not hugging anyone related to '12 Years' opting instead to cross the aisle and give his former colleague, American Hustle director David O. Russell, a hug. The Wrap reports that the frostiness between the British director and American screenwriter has been developing for months. Unidentified sources told The Wrap that McQueen, who was the a producer and the director of the film, asked Ridley to share the writing credit with him as well.

Trouble: McQueen reportedly ordered Ridley and his wife Gayle to sit far removed from the rest of the '12 Years' group at the Baftas and ended up screaming at Gayle while her husband was in the bathroom . Such a request is not unusual in the . industry, especially since it was his wife who flagged up Solomon . Northup's book which ended up serving as the basis of the film. On top . of that, McQueen has been listed as the co-writer on his two other . feature films. Ridley . reportedly denied the request, but that didn't stop McQueen from going . to the film's production company, Plan B, to urge them to step in on his . behalf. Plan B, . which is led by Brad Pitt, ended up siding with Ridley but they were . determined to keep everyone quiet about the rift because they thought it . would ruin the film's chances of winning over Academy voters and taking . home the Best Picture win. McQueen . was apparently the most difficult part of that plan, however, since the . emotional director made very clear moves to distance himself from . Ridley. While '12 Years' cleaned up at awards season, McQueen would very rarely mention Ridley in acceptance speeches. Bizarre: Rather than smile, McQueen only gave Ridley an unenthusiastic open-palm clap, and it is now rumored that he wanted a credit as a co-writer for the film like he has received in his last two pictures . Stoic: McQueen was effusive when Lupita Nyong'o . won Best Supporting Actress but showed no such love for Ridley, only . giving this perfunctory clap as he walked towards the stage . Moving right past: As John Ridley went on stage to collect his screenwriting Oscar, he did not stop and hug anyone related to the film who were all sitting in front of him, including director Steve McQueen (right) At the Golden Globes, he only mentioned Ridley after another producer reminded him to do so while on stage. At the Baftas, McQueen mandated that Ridley and his wife be seated away from the rest of the '12 Years' group. McQueen went on to scream at Ridley's wife Gayle and tried to take her event souvenirs while her husband was in the bathroom. For his part, Ridley has tried to tone down the rhetoric about their feud, praising the director at Oscar parties. 'Listen, without Steve McQueen I wouldn’t have this Oscar tonight,' he told The Post. 'I owe a lot to the genius of Steve McQueen, and I am forever grateful to have had the chance to work with him.' McQueen has not spoken about Ridley at . all, talking instead about his effusive Big Picture speech that ended . with the director jumping up in the air- while Ridley stood apart from . the rest of the group towards the back of the stage. Serious moment: While Ridley thanked the film's producers 'Mr Brad Pitt' and Jeremy Kleiner, he did not mention McQueen at all even though they had been working on the project together since 2008 . On the outside: Ridley stood at the back and didn't interact with any of the other members of the film's team during their Best Picture acceptance . Rolling his eyes? Photos show that he was not . smiling nor enthused at what is widely considered the night's biggest . award but may have even been making light of the win . Standing apart: Ridley physically removed himself from the group . 'It's . one of those moments in life that might never happen again but you're . living it, you're there, and it might never happen again so emotions . just take over,' McQueen told The Mirror. As Ridley mentioned in his speech, he . started his Hollywood career by writing for sitcoms including Martin . Lawrence's eponymous show and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. His first film was the poorly-received Sean Penn thriller U Turn that he co-wrote with director Oliver Stone. What a difference: When they won for Best Picture, however, he was literally jumping for joy . In . 1999, he wrote David O. Russell's film Three Kings, which may explain . why he went out of his way to hug his former collaborator on Sunday . night. He then took a thematic turn, writing the 2002 comedy Undercover Brother. More recently he co-wrote the World War II film Red Tails and then wrote and directed the Jimi Hendrix biopic All Is . By My Side which was released at the Toronto Film Festival in September . and will be on screens more widely this summer. Ridley has told how he and McQueen started talking about doing a slave-era project together in 2008 and he told IndieWire that it was McQueen's wife who found the Solomon Northup story to use as the baseline. Distancing himself: McQueen looked as if he was actively trying to avert his eyes so as not to look at Ridley . Clear slight: Rather than hug anyone related to the film, including star Michael Fassbender of mega producer Harvey Weinstein, Ridley went across the aisle and gave American Hustle director David O. Russell a hug . Walking right past: Ridley didn't acknowledge Lupita Nyong'o or producer Brad Pitt, but only giving Pitt a mention during his speech when he was on stage . 'Steve said, ""I really wanted to tell a . story about that time and place and the slave era in America but I . wanted to have a character that was not obvious in terms of their trade . in slavery, someone who had artistic abilities and who had station but . found themselves in a different geographical location. Something that . has scope and scale emotionally,""' according to Ridley. 'Working with Steve was difficult only . with the geography. He lives in Amsterdam and I live in Los Angeles and . in that time period ""Shame"" came together for him and ""All Is By My . Side"" came together for me but we both thought that this was something . worth doing.' In addition to . taking home three of the biggest Oscars, 12 Years A Slave also had a . successful night on Saturday at the Independent Spirit Awards winning . Best Feature, Director, Screenplay, Supporting Female, and . Cinematography. Returning the favor: When McQueen gave a speech as the film won Best Picture, he did not mention Ridley at all either . Mixed reactions: Ridley did not seem happy to . greet Angelina Jolie, whose partner Brad Pitt produced his film, but was . much more interested in talking to Sidney Poitier backstage . Ridley was said to have become . emotional during his speech and even went so far as to mention McQueen . in his speech at the event, calling the director 'fun'. Ridley went on to give a shout out to Julie Deply, who was nominated as a co-writer for Before Midnight. For . his part, McQueen chose to highlight the talents of Michael Fassbender, . who has been in every one of his three movies including 12 Years A . Slave- but showed no such love for Ridley.","Screenwriter John Ridley said that he didn't mention Steve McQueen in his Best Adapted Screenplay acceptance speech simply because of time .

Hospital visitors were able to watch surgeons operating on a naked patient after window blinds were left open, it was claimed today. Bosses at Epsom Hospital in Surrey have apologised to the patient and launched a ‘thorough and urgent’ investigation after care assistant Claire Walsh, 38, alerted staff during a visit last Friday. Miss Walsh said that she, three visitors and a patient all saw the surgery taking place in a room in the building opposite to where she was. She said some of the blinds on that room's window were open. She contacted the hospital to report the . incident and added that she informed a nurse on the ward, who allegedly . said ‘that happens all the time’ and took no action to raise the alarm . with staff. Probe: Bosses at Epsom Hospital (file picture) in Surrey have apologised to the patient and launched a 'thorough and urgent' investigation after care assistant Claire Walsh, 38, alerted staff during a visit last Friday . Miss Walsh said: ‘I could see the whole thing. The blinds were open, not closed, so you could see straight through. Half of the window had blinds, but the other half didn’t have blinds at all. ‘There was a naked body on its side. The doctors were lifting up the leg and doing all kinds of bits to the body.  It looked like they were making incisions and there was someone standing over the body.’ Care assistant Miss Walsh said the main lights of the operating room were on and there was another light close to the patient - who was believed to have been undergoing a hip operation. She added: ‘It was still light outside. The blinds should have been shut. That poor person’s respect and dignity had gone out of the window. Where did their rights come into it? ‘The visitors were all disgusted and so was the patient who saw. I feel sorry for that person, it’s just awful. If I had a kid with me that would have been traumatic and horrific.’ Miss Walsh, of Tattenham Corner, Surrey, was referred to the hospital's Patient Advice and Liaison Service following her complaint. The hospital offered the patient the opportunity to speak to its Patient Advice and Liaison service – but the patient did not wish to take it any further. The hospital has apologised to the patient and said the blinds had not been closed properly after the window was cleaned. It has also launched a ‘thorough and urgent’ investigation into the incident. Miss Walsh said she was ‘still in shock’ after witnessing the operation, which she said was continuing as she left after her half-hour visit. An Epsom Hospital spokesman said: ‘As a trust we take the privacy, dignity and confidentiality of our patients very seriously. ‘On Friday, January 10, we believe that a secure blind in a window to one of our operating theatres, which is usually closed and locked between two panes of double glazing, was not closed properly after the window was cleaned. Operation: Miss Walsh said that she, three other visitors and a patient all saw the surgery taking place in a room in the building opposite. She said some of the blinds on the window of that room were open (file picture) ‘As such, part of one of our operating theatres may have been visible to a small number of other patients and we deeply regret that. ‘We have contacted the patient affected to discuss this incident and have offered our full and sincere apologies. However, as with any patient undergoing an operation, this patient would have been protected by a gown and sterilised drapes throughout the procedure.’ The spokesman added that having spoken to the staff and surgeon who conducted the operation in question, the hospital does not believe that the patient would have been naked at any point. She said: ‘During the operation the . patient is covered in sterile theatre drapes so only a small part of the . side of the body would have been exposed.’ 'The visitors were all disgusted and so was the patient who saw. I feel sorry for that person, it’s just awful. If I had a kid with me that would have been traumatic and horrific' Claire Walsh, care assistant . Asked about the nurse’s comments to Miss Walsh which suggested that this was not a one-off incident, the spokesman said: ‘The issue has never been raised with us before. ‘We are currently looking into the allegation that this lady’s claims were initially dismissed.’ The hospital’s joint medical director Dr Ruth Charlton said: ‘We would like to assure our patients and visitors that we are taking this matter very seriously, and the thorough investigation we have launched is still underway. ‘As such, we cannot offer any further information until all of the facts are fully established. This is the first time such an incident has ever been reported to us, and we are urgently investigating the allegations. ‘Although it is rare, in any situation where we feel that a patients’ privacy may have been compromised we will not hesitate to act, and will take immediate steps to help ensure that a similar event could not happen again. ‘I have personally asked all five of our directorates (medicine, women and children’s, regional services, clinical services and surgery, critical care and anaesthetics) to review every clinical area they are responsible for, in order to ensure that the privacy and dignity of every patient we treat is protected at all times.’ The £2.5million Day Case Unit - where the operation was believed to have taken place - at the hospital was opened in October 2012 by the Duchess of Gloucester. At the time, Matthew Hopkins, the hospital’s chief executive, said it was designed ‘around the needs of our patients with an emphasis on ensuring patients receive the utmost privacy and dignity’.","Epsom Hospital bosses apologise to patient and launch investigation .

Savings: Families can save up to £300 a year by switching to smaller suppliers such as First Utility . An estimated 150,000 families have left the  ‘big six’ energy giants so far this winter in protest at spiralling prices, experts say. Customers who switch to a smaller supplier, such as First Utility or Ovo Energy, can save up to £300 a year. Comparison websites had record levels of visitors looking for a better deal as the six dominant suppliers – British Gas, SSE, EDF, E.ON, npower and Scottish Power – imposed above-inflation price rises. At npower, the average bill soared by 10.4 per cent. Some 150,000 people have made the move to smaller firms in the last two months, said Mark Todd, of website energyhelpline.com. He added: ‘We’re seeing record levels  of switching. The big six are under serious attack from  new contenders. ‘The major suppliers still dominate in terms of customer numbers, but they don’t in terms of switches any more. ‘Smaller firms are offering credible alternatives that save people lots of money – hence they are switching in droves.’ But around half of homes, including many pensioners and people who are renting, have never switched suppliers, energy regulator Ofgem said. As a result, some 13million families, including some of the poorest in society, could be missing out on the best deals. Smaller suppliers include Co-operative Energy, Ovo Energy, First Utility and US-backed firm Green Star Energy. The findings come as the government wields market forces to try to keep energy prices in check . A typical deal with a big six firm . costs £1,320 a year, while First Utility’s best fixed deal is just . £1,037, meaning some people could save £300 a year.  Website . MoneySupermarket.com has also seen a massive growth in demand to switch, . with more than 15 times as many people searching for cheap tariffs . since the big six began pushing up prices. Spokesman Clare Francis said: . ‘The vast majority of households have never switched energy provider . and as a result are paying over the odds. ‘We’ve . still got a long way to go before switching becomes habitual, but it . appears as though the latest round of price hikes could prove to be the . tipping point.’ The .

The former East German communist regime forced prisoners to donate blood for sale to the West and make goods for many companies across the Cold War frontier,  German media has reported. Among customers in the West were not just furniture maker Ikea, as previously reported, but also discount supermarket chain Aldi, auto giant Volkswagen and other firms, claimed a television report broadcast last night. The new revelations from the 1970s and 80s were screened by public broadcaster ARD and are based on a historian's review of files of East Germany's Stasi secret police and interviews. The former East German communist regime forced prisoners to donate blood for sale to the West and make goods for many companies across the Cold War frontier,  German media has reported . Terror: The Stasi secret police, the Berlin HQ of which is pictured here, allegedly forced political prisoners to work for the store . The German Democratic Republic (GDR), desperate for hard currency, sold the prisoners' blood through a Swiss middleman to the Red Cross branch of the southern German state of Bavaria, said the report. Former GDR health official Rudolf Uhlig told the program that prison visits were 'well worth the effort ... because every time we had 60-70 blood donors, and that was a pretty good success'. The Bavarian Red Cross confirmed to the 'Report Mainz' program that it bought GDR blood in the 1980s, voicing 'deep regret', but said it was unclear whether it was then aware the blood came from prisoners. Is is claimed customers in the West included auto giant Volkswagen and other firms, according to a television report broadcast last night . Supermarket chain Aldi told the programme that at the time it sourced women's stockings from an East German company, but said it did not know the manufacturer employed female prison labour . Stasi files indicated that the inmates were given no choice, citing an informant's report that nurses once refused to cooperate as they realised 'the poor prisoners ... were surely all compelled'. Historian Tobias Wunschik told the programme that 'it was part of the logic of the system ... that you not only exploited prisoners' labour but ... also physically took their blood and sold it in the West'. Wunschik, who led the state-commissioned study, also said hundreds of Western firms, more than previously known, bought goods from the GDR, a German-speaking, geographically close 'low-wage country'. 'In many cases this included goods . made by prison labour,' Wunschik was quoted as saying, estimating the . annual trade in jailhouse products was worth at least 200 million . deutschmarks ($A152 million today). Supermarket . chain Aldi told the programme that at the time it sourced women's . stockings from an East German company, but said it did not know the . manufacturer employed female prison labour. In 2012 IKEA expressed regret that it benefited from the use of forced prison labour by some of its suppliers in communist East Germany more than two decades ago . Volkswagen bought auto parts partially made under similar conditions but the auto giant also told the program it did not know at the time prison labour was involved. The Commissioner for Stasi Records, Roland Jahn, demanded German companies now open their archives to help clear up past wrongs, saying: 'Those who did business with the dictatorship could never be certain under which conditions the products were made.' In 2012 IKEA expressed regret that it had . benefited from the use of forced prison labour by some of its suppliers . in communist East Germany more than two decades ago. The . Swedish furniture giant released a report showing that East German . prisoners, among them many political dissidents, were involved in the . manufacture of goods that were supplied to IKEA 25 to 30 years ago. The . report concluded that IKEA managers were aware of the possibility that . prisoners would be used in the manufacture of its products and took some . measures to prevent this, but they were insufficient. 'We deeply regret that this could happen,' said Jeanette Skjelmose, an IKEA manager. 'The use of political prisoners for manufacturing was at no point accepted by IKEA.' But . she added that 'at the time we didnâ€™t have the well-developed control . system that we have today and we clearly did too little to prevent such . production methods.'","New revelations from 1970s and 80s were screened in Germany last night .

A Nebraska woman aboard a Caribbean cruise who fell ill last month quickly received a helping hand from 150 kindhearted passengers and crew willing to donate their blood to her cause. Elaine Smith, now 73, was celebrating her birthday with husband Homer on the Carnival Liberty when she passed out after losing blood through a bleeding ulcer. The crew broadcasted a plea for blood donors and an extraordinary number of them quickly answered the call. 'I was overwhelmed,' he said. 'I didn't count the people but I was told there were over 150 people there.' Her angels: Elaine Smith fell ill on a cruise late last month and 150 people aboard rushed to help by donating blood . But Mrs. Smith required B-positive blood. Mr. Smith told the Sun-Sentinel that he was chosen to give a pint of blood to his wife, as were a crewman and two female passengers. Carnival spokesman Vance Gulliksen told the Sun-Sentinel that that medical crews can currently screen blood donated while aboard the ship for HIV. He says they will also soon be able to test for hepatitis. Urgent: Smith was aboard the Carnival Liberty with her husband Homer when she collapsed, in part due to blood loss from a bleeding stomach ulcer . In order to minimize risk in emergency situations, cruise ships favor crewmembers for donations because they've been pre-screened for blood-borne illness. They'll also turn to the sick passenger's family members. When the captain was told of Mrs. Smith's illness, he increased speed to their next port-of-call. Smith is now in a Jacksonville hospital where her nurse practitioner daughter Roberta King lives and works. Homer Smith became emotional discussing her journey there, which began Feb 22. 'The situation was horrible but they were so good to us,' he said . 'When we got to Grand Cayman she got three [more units of blood at a hospital],' Smith told the Sun-Sentinel. 'On the air ambulance they gave her two.' Smith was admitted to a Ft. Lauderdale hospital on Friday--which was her 73rd birthday--but her journey has not yet ended. On Tuesday, Mrs. Smith was taken to a Jacksonville hospital, where her nurse practitioner daughter, Roberta King, lives and works. 'My daughter found out that [my wife] . was taking a baby aspirin to help heart attacks and strokes, but if you . have a tender stomach it can do damage that way and I didn't realize . that,' Mr. Smith said. In . a Wednesday night post to her Facebook page, King indicated that her . mother remained sedated and was recieving treatment for several health . concerns in addition to her bleeding ulcer. As . he waits for his wife of 33 years' condition to improve, Homer Smith . remained ever thankful for the goodness of his fellow Carnival Liberty . passengers. 'The doctor, . the nurses, the people, Guest Services, and they said any time you want . to call your daughter, come down here and just talk,' he said. 'They . didn't charge me one thing.

Despite being surrounded by 'on-demand' entertainment services, it was regular live TV that took up the largest share of people's time with the average American watching more than five hours a day. Next comes another old fashioned medium - radio - which is listened to for an average of two hours and 46 minutes a day. More surprising still is that while 58 per cent of Americans own smartphones, they are only used for slightly over an hour a day on average. The internet is also used for a similar amount of time while timeshifted TV packages such as TiVo were watched for 32 minutes a day. Hardcore gamers clearly make up a small percentage of the sample as the average playing time is just 12 minutes, less still was DVDs and Blu Rays which are watched for an average of just nine minutes a day and came joint last with multimedia devices. The position of tablets such as the iPad at the bottom of the pile is also unexpected as rapid growth has seen tablets become the third largest electronics sector after TVs and PCs. A Nielsen spokesman said: 'Content in its many forms is a . constant draw and the American consumer continues to show us that they . want to be entertained and engaged.

A U.S. Air Force jet was forced to abort its take-off after it hit a fish as the plane made its way down the runway. Officials from the MacDill Air Force Base, near Tampa, Florida, have said the Gulfstream G-IV jet was just about to take-off when the collision between the plane and the sheepshead fish occurred. The crew was forced to abort the take off when they heard a thud after seeing an Osprey fly in front of the aircraft just moments before, Lt. Cmdr. Nicholas Toth, a pilot with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has said. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, pilot Lt. Cmdr Nick Toth holds up a fish in front of his Gulfstream G-IV at the base in Tampa, Florida . The Airfield Management and Operations Wildlife Management was called to look for a bird following the incident in September. In a report on the MacDill Air Force Base website, Lindsey Garven, 6th Air Mobility Wing Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard contractor, said: 'We swept the runway, but we didn't find any remains of the bird. 'We continued our search and were surprised to find a 9-inch sheepshead lying near the end of the runway.' Samples of the fish and DNA taken from the aircraft were then sent to a laboratory in Washington D.C. for tests, which confirmed the plane had struck the fish during takeoff. Toth said at first the crew could not believe the results of the test. He said: 'There was no way we hit a fish during takeoff. I mean, how does something like that even happen?' An osprey carrying the nine-inch sheepshead flew in front of a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Gulfstrean G-IV jet as it prepared to take-off and dropped the fish causing it to strike the plane . It is believed the Osprey was eating the fish on the runway but dropped it as it flew up into the air after spotting the aircraft approach. This is not the first time a plane has been known to be affected by a fish strike. An AP report in April, 1987, claims a midair collision between a jet airliner and a fish delayed an Alaska Airlines flight for about an hour while the plane was inspected for damage. A mechanic was dispatched to the plane's next stop, in Yakutat, where the plane was inspected, a spokesman for the airlines said. 'They found a greasy spot with some scales, but no damage,' said Paul Bowers, manager of the Juneau airport. The airport spokesman said the fish had been dropped by a bald eagle, which apparently escaped injury.","Gulfstream G-IV jet was just about to take-off when crew heard a thud .

A couple who adopted triplets and then fell pregnant with twins after thinking they could not conceive have revealed their hectic daily routine. Speaking over the sound of babies' cries, Sarah and Andy Justice appeared on the Today show on Thursday to introduce their adorable brood and explain how an army of helpers gets them through. The couple, from Tulsa, Oklahoma said the children work through 84 bottles and 300 diapers a week - although as soon as they finish cleaning up one, there is another crying for a change. They set the babies - eight-week-old twins Abigail and Andrew and nine-month-old triplets Joel, Hannah and Elizabeth - side-by-side in high chairs for meal times and coordinate their bed times. Scroll down for video . Full couch: Sarah and Andy Justice from Oklahoma are pictured with their triplets and twins - who were all born within a year - as they appear on the Today show on Thursday morning . It means very little sleep for their parents though - just three hours a day, and sometimes not consecutively, Mr Justice said. 'It is overwhelming and it was more than a little ironic' to fall pregnant after adopting the triplets, he said, adding that he thinks God must have a sense of humor. Mrs Justice added that the babies were a daily challenge - but there was nothing they would change about their lives. 'My husband says all we do is babies, everything else in life has pretty . much stopped,' she said. 'But it was something we've wanted so badly . that we love it. It’s not to say it's not a lot of work and we're not . tired a lot but it’s great. We just really love having these children.' 'Blessed': The couple said they are getting through on 3 hours of sleep a day - although it's not consecutively . Planning: Mrs Justice, pictured at her home, said they don't go on trips unless they really have to . Dinner time: They line up the babies to be fed - and get through as many as 84 bottles a week . They've also developed tricks to cope with the babies, such as painting their toenails different colors to tell them apart, or placing bows in different positions on their heads - as on display on Thursday. The couple also credited family, friends and church members with helping them out and donated hundreds of diapers, meaning they haven't had to buy a single one. The Justice family grew from two to seven in less than a year. After struggling to conceive, the Justices went to see a specialist who told them IVF would cost them up to $60,000 and they'd still have just a 10 per cent chance of getting pregnant. So, they told Tulsa World, they decided to adopt, and after an arduous time they were matched with a soon-to-be mother. However, when Sarah took the birth mother for an ultrasound, the doctor had a surprise - not one but three babies were on the way. Introduction: The Today show hosts had their hands full as they met the five babies on Thursday . The babies were born premature but . healthy nine months ago, and were still in neonatal intensive care when . Sarah and Andy had their second surprise. Sarah was pregnant. Two months later, at a sonogram to find out the sex of the new baby, Sarah called Andy. 'One is a boy,' she said. 'One!?' he exclaimed. He had in fact been joking that they would probably have twins, but never for a minute thought it would actually happen. 'That'll teach me to keep my mouth shut,' he told Tulsa World, laughing. Just born: Sarah and Andy, pictured after the birth of their triplets, learned they were pregnant while the newborns were still in the neonatal unit . Twins: Andrew, left, and Abigail were a happy surprise for the couple who did not think they could have kids . On Thursday, Sarah told the Today show: 'I was shocked and a bit overwhelmed because I got to thinking, added it up and I’m like, wow, if they go to term we're about five babies in eight months. 'But we were really excited because it was something we’ve been dreaming of and longing for for years.' Abigail and Andrew were born healthy and are now eight weeks old. Andy . believes the twins may not have even come along had the adoption not . panned out so well and taken away the stress they'd been under. 'We've been very, very blessed,' Andy said. Surprise: The triplets - Joel, Hannah and Elizabeth - were born premature but healthy nine months ago, and were still in neonatal intensive care when Sarah and Andy had their second surprise.

Evidence of the brutality of poachers in South Africa has surfaced once again with a shocking video of another badly mutilated rhino in Kruger National Park. Footage of the animal staggering along a road with its horn hacked off was filmed by horrified tourists and uploaded to YouTube. Clearly in distress, the film, shot on February 28, shows the rhino swaying from side to side and then stumbling into the undergrowth. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Shocking: A mutilated rhino was filmed by tourists stumbling along a road in the Kruger National Park in South Africa . In distress: Poachers had cruelly hacked off its horn and left it to die in agony . The heart-breaking footage follows a graphic video that went viral earlier in February of a white rhino found in the same park last year that had its horns, tongue, nose and eyes savagely hacked off. That animal had to be euthanized – and the rhino filmed more recently was also put down. But tragically it remained alive in agony for five days. It wasn’t found by park rangers until Tuesday and they discovered that it had a bullet lodged in its brain. Reynold Thakhuli from South African National Parks said: ‘An assessment was conducted to determine the extent of the injuries and suffering. It was discovered that a bullet had lodged in the rhino’s brain and therefore any chance of survival was slim.’ Too late to save: Rangers eventually found the animal five days later and put it down as they discovered it had a bullet lodged in its brain . Thakhuli said the Ranger in charge, after a thorough assessment of the animal, took a decision to put it down to end the suffering that it had endured since the poaching incident. He said: ‘There was simply no chance of surviving for this poor animal and unfortunately it had to be put down. ‘We will continue to work hard in the fight against the overwhelming scourge that is currently targeting the KNP... to us one rhino killed is one too many.’ South African National Parks said in a . statement that it would like to 'extend its gratitude to the visitors . who alerted the authorities about the heart-breaking incident'. Last year 1,004 rhinos were killed in South Africa by poachers, which is 7,700 per cent more than 2007, according to the WWF . Royal collection: There are more than 1,200 items in the Royal Collection which are listed as containing ivory, including this throne and footstool . Heather Sohl, Chief Species Advisor at WWF-UK, told MailOnline: 'It’s a terrible sight, but this video has highlighted an occurrence that sadly isn’t as rare as it should be. 'The rate of rhino poaching in South Africa is horrific and it’s happening to feed an unnecessary demand for their horns in Asia. 'Last year 1,004 rhinos were killed in South Africa by poachers, which is a shocking 7,700 per cent more than 2007, when 13 rhinos were poached. Unfortunately the rate of poaching so far this year shows no sign of reducing. We need strong action to combat this serious crime.' Prince William called for 1,200 ivory artefacts in Buckingham Palace to be destroyed to send a message to illegal elephant poachers.

Mr Arch, from Coventry, West Midlands, started the job in 1943 as a favour for his father, who ran the family milk business. Scroll down for video .

Best in the west: Mr Arch gets up at 2.30am seven days a week to deliver the milk to his customers. He has worked for the family business, which was set up by his own grandfather, since 1943 . But 71 years on, Mr Arch is still going strong - and now delivers to more than 300 homes. He said: ‘When I was young I would take out two churns of milk, which I carried on my pushbike. I would stop at the customer’s houses, and walk straight in. No-one locked their doors in those days. ‘I would then ladle the milk into their jug and be on my way. Everything was much simpler back then- it was a different time.’ But not everything has changed for Mr Arch in the past seven decades. While Ernie The Fastest Milkman in the West - a fictional character created by comedian Benny Hill - delivered his goods in a horse-drawn cart, Mr Arch still proudly delivers in his 1950s milk float. The archaic vehicle, which he has owned for 30 years, can do a top speed of 15mph – if it’s going downhill. Milk in the veins: Derek Arch, left, aged 18 - four years after his first milk round, which he did as a favour for his ill father. The 85-year-old is now helped by his own son, Stuart, 54, who plans to take over the business . The milk industry has been in the Arch family for four generations. Mr Arch’s grandfather founded the business, D Arch and Sons, in 1873. Derek planned to be a carpenter but was roped into doing his first milkround at age 14 when his father was ill. He said: ‘It should have been a short term stand-in but I’ve ended up doing it ever since. I wouldn’t have been a very good carpenter anyway.’ Decades on, the business is still a . family affair. Mr Arch works with his son Stuart, 54, who will follow in . his father's footsteps and take over the business. Milk rounds: Ernie The Fastest Milkman In The West is booked by a policeman as he rides his horse-drawn milk float. The character was created by Benny Hill from his hit record of the same name . And his wife Betty, 83, to whom Mr Arch has been married for 63 years, used to organise the business accounts. But even though Betty no longer works, Mr Arch has no plans to retire. He said: ‘I’ve done if for this long so I may as well carry on. Anyway, Betty likes it because it keeps me out of the house!’ Mr Arch also has one grandson, who is 17, but says the teenager has no intention of carrying on the family business. After years of experience, the proud milkman now has his routine down to a fine art. After waking at 2.30am, Mr Arch usually leaves the house at 4.30am to make sure his customers get their milk in time for breakfast. Not for the faint hearted: Mr Arch says he has no plans to retire even though his wife Betty, 83, is retired . He said: ‘Back in the day, I didn’t have to rush my guts out to finish- I could be done at one o’clock in the afternoon. ‘Usually women didn’t work so there was always someone at home to collect the milk. ‘But now I only have a short amount of time to do my deliveries before people go off to work in the morning.’ Luckily, Mr Arch is still kept busy, despite demand for milkmen falling. Ernie: Comedian Benny Hill as fictional character Ernie The Fastest Milkman in the West . He said: ‘Although there isn’t the same demand as there once was, people still want milk and I have grown to know my customers very well. ‘When you work at a job for as long as I have, your customers go up and down as they pop their clogs. ‘I used to do the milk for everyone in my cul-de-sac, now only two of them have the milk from me. 'Milkmen are dropping like flies. Our motto is: use us or lose us.' Derek says the industry is very different, compared to when he first started out. According to Mr Arch, the days of milk in bottles, which used to cost around two old pennies, are over. He said: ‘What people don’t tell you is glass bottle are the most environmentally friendly as you can wash and reuse them time and time again. ‘Think how much plastic is wasted with milk cartons now. It’s terrible.’ After working for more than seven decades, Mr Arch still has the same work ethic as he has always done. He said: ‘The only difference now is I feel the cold. When I was a youngster I could go out delivering the milk without so much of a coat on - we had 10-15 degree winters back then. ‘But now it can be bitter and I’m just an old man trying to do a good job. I have to wrap right up.’ Mr Arch Jnr, 54, said: ‘My great grandad started this business and I am glad to be a part of it. ‘I am proud of Dad for the way he works- I hope I’m still delivering pints when I’m his age.’","Derek Arch, 85, still has a milkround of more than 300 homes .

Legoland has been forced to close this weekend after far-right extremists threatened to target a planned Muslim fun day booked by a radical cleric even though it had been cancelled. The theme park in Windsor, Berkshire, had been hired out exclusively to the Muslim Research and Development Foundation. The group, based in east London, is run by Haitham al-Haddad, who is said to be one of the top 25 radical preachers in Britain. More than 1,000 Muslim families were expected to attend on Sunday at a cost of around £100,000 before police advised that the event be cancelled. However, despite this bosses at Legoland have decided to close the theme park this weekend including its 150-room hotel because of safety fears. A spokesman for Legoland said: 'Unfortunately the Legoland Windsor Resort has had to close the Hotel on Saturday 8th and Sunday 9th March 2014 after threats from right-wing groups made against the Resort. 'The Hotel closure follows the cancellation of a private event that was due to take place on Sunday 9th March prior to the Theme  Park re-opening for the 2014 season on Friday 14th Match. 'We are extremely sorry that we’ve had to cancel guest bookings and whole heartedly understand the disappointment of those families that will be unable to attend, particularly as we haven’t been able to give them more notification because of the dynamic nature of this situation. 'The safety and security of our guests and our members of staff has to be our is our number one priority, which is why we’ve made the difficult decision to close the Hotel.  All guests that were booked in to stay will be given a full refund.' The theme park has been inundated with threatening phone calls, emails and posts online after details of Sunday's event emerged. One Neo-Nazi group wrote that it would make police in Thames Valley their 'b****' and that threatening children 'rocks'. The post on the group's Facebook page also said: ‘My dad would be so proud if he knew I existed #itsgreatbeingus’ Members of the English Defence League were also said to have been involved. Target: Staff at Legoland were threatened by far-right group after it emerged that the park had been booked out. Day trip: More than 1,000 Muslim families were to attend the day costing around £100,000. A spokeswoman for Legoland told MailOnline the neo-Nazi group also posted a picture of one of their Muslim workers on Facebook with an offensive comment. She added the extent of the abuse led Legoland to take down its Facebook page for a week. The decision to cancel the event completely was made on the advice of police after no guarantees for the safety of staff and guests could be made. Thames Valley Police are investigating reports of the offences under the Malicious Communications Act. Legoland has previously hosted several exclusive parties and celebrities such as Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie as well as David and Victoria Beckham.","Radical Muslim cleric Haitham al-Haddad booked Legoland so Muslims could enjoy day of 'halal entertainment' on March 9 .

"By . Laura Clark . PUBLISHED: . 18:19 EST, 5 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 19:09 EST, 5 March 2014 . Firm favourite: Enid Blyton's first Famous Five book. The series of children's books is the favourite of parents in Britain, a poll has found . It may be 70 years since they first appeared, but Enid Blyton’s Famous Five novels remain the books most favoured by parents for their children, a poll reveals. The adventures of Julian, Dick, Anne, George and Timmy the dog topped a survey in which parents were asked to name their favourite children’s books. Two other series by Blyton, the Secret Seven and Malory Towers, also made the top five, confirming her status as the nation’s best-loved children’s author. Among children, however, JK Rowling’s Harry Potter series emerged as the favourite. The survey, carried out to mark World Book Day today, suggested that children's book tastes are inherited from their parents since choices were similar across both top 10 charts. Adventure tales, such as Treasure Island, the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and Blyton's 21-book series, first published in 1942, were popular among both audiences. Despite the recent popularity of futuristic titles such as the Hunger Games, the science fiction genre failed to make an impact on the children's list. Instead, classics such as Thomas the Tank Engine, the Mr Men and Little Miss books and the Gruffalo featured strongly in their top 10. Authors appearing in both sets of results were Blyton, whose Famous Five tales came fourth on the children's list, as well as Roald Dahl and CS Lewis. The poll also showed that more than three quarters of children would choose the paper version of a book over an e-book or tablet. Among children dressing up for World Book Day, The Boy Who Lived emerged as the most popular character for children to go as. Along with Harry Potter, other popular costume choices for the day were Horrid Henry, Where's Wally and Cinderella. A scene from one of the Harry Potter films: JK Rowling's series about a boy wizard was the children's favourite . The poll, by Asda, questioned 1,747 parents including 1,000 with children under 13. They answered on their children's behalf. Hayley Whittaker, Asda's childrens' books buyer, said: 'Even though hundreds of new children's titles are released every week, parents and kids alike are united in their love of classic childhood literature, with their humour and adventure proving relevant across generations. 'It's clear to see that kids still think nothing beats the feeling of having a real book in their hands.' There was less positive news about children's reading habits in a separate poll, also released today. Significant numbers of youngsters are unaware that popular characters from films and TV programmes actually originated in books. According to a survey of 500 eight to 13-year-olds, 40 per cent are unaware that Harry Potter started life in a book, and even more - 42 per cent - didn't know Winnie the Pooh is a literary character.","Children chose JK Rowling's Harry Potter series as their favourite .

Police have apologised to the family of a severely-autistic man who was allegedly beaten in the street by two officers as he helped put out the bins. Faruk Ali, 33, who has had learning difficulties and severe autism since childhood, was allegedly attacked by two uniformed offices as he helped binmen collect the rubbish outside his family's home. His family allege he was hurled into some bins and pinned down as he tried to get back inside his home in Luton, Bedfordshire. The family of Faruk Ali (pictured) have said he was beaten in the street by two police officers as he helped put out the bins. Mr Ali (right) shows his injuries after he was allegedly beaten by the police . They claim the two officers then beat Mr Ali because they thought he looked 'suspicious'. His brother Dhobir, 31, has said Mr Ali was clearly wearing a badge to alert people that he suffers from autism. He says there has been no full explanation from police over the incident and called for the officers involved to be sacked. The force yesterday said the officers had been placed on ‘restricted duties’ and an internal investigation has begun which will be supervised by the IPCC. Dhobir Ali said: 'The family has been traumatised by the whole experience. Faruq hasn’t actually recovered yet, he’s still traumatised.

"By . Luke Garratt . PUBLISHED: . 15:45 EST, 5 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 08:26 EST, 6 March 2014 . A teenage girl who died from an asthma attack after it was revealed that an ambulance was sent to the wrong address, 'could not have been saved' despite the ambulance service's failures, according to a coroner's report. The East of England Ambulance Service (EEAS) has been told that it 'must learn from its mistakes', after the ambulance requested from RAF Brampton, in Cambridgeshire, following Elouise Keeling collapsing with breathing problems, was sent to RAF Wyton, 10 miles away. The ambulance was called at 7.44pm, but because of the mistake, did not arrive until 8.03pm, and Elouise, 14, who had suffered from asthma since she was 18 months old, died at the scene as her mother Karen looked on. Scroll down for video . An ambulance was immediately called at 7.44pm but was sent to RAF Wyton, 10 miles away, by mistake. The error meant it did not arrive until 8.03pm . Elouise, who had suffered from asthma since she was 18 months old, died at the scene. Her mother told an inquest she rushed to her daughter's side after she had called her saying she felt unwell . At the inquest at Huntingdon Law Courts, coroner David Morris said her death may not have been prevented even if the ambulance had arrived sooner. However, he said: 'There is a lot that needs to be addressed by the ambulance service. 'There is good cause for those around her to feel aggrieved. 'The tragedy could not have been avoided by any more timely arrival but that doesn’t in anyway minimise the distress and concern on behalf of the family. 'I’m satisfied the ambulance service has been found wanting and has already taken many steps to address the issues raised.' Elouise Keeling collapsed with breathing problems at RAF Brampton near Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire. An ambulance was immediately called at 7.44pm but was sent to RAF Wyton, 10 miles away, by mistake . Delays: Emergency services were called when Elouise had an asthma attack but paramedics did not reach her in time and she died . Emergency care expert Dr John Heyworth, who complied a report on behalf of the EEAS, said that Elouise's prognosis had been 'grim' and it was unlikely she would have survived even if paramedics had gotten there earlier. 'There is no doubt earlier intervention would have increased the chances of a better outcome,' Dr Heyworth added. 'But by that point her chances of survival were low and if the ambulance had arrived a few minutes earlier, it would not have made a significant difference.' Before her fatal asthma episode, Elouise had only managed to jog to a playing field and had not taken part in any activity when she suffered the attack. Elouise Keeling, 14, collapsed with breathing problems during an Air Cadets sports day at RAF Brampton near Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, on June 25 . She had seen a paediatrician about her worsening asthma earlier that day but was not considered an immediate risk, the inquest heard. Pathologist Martin Goddard found she died of acute, severe asthma. Dr Goddard said: 'This case is quite unusual. 'Her condition was very difficult to treat and potentially irreversible. 'Cases that are rapidly progressive in this way, tend to have a bad outcome.' RAF Brampton was only four minutes by ambulance from Hinchingbrooke Hospital but, because she suffered a cardiac arrest, paramedics decided it was better to treat her at the scene. The inquest earlier heard that ambulances had struggled to find RAF Brampton during incidents in 2006 and 2012 due to confusion over the postcode. These problems were reported to the ambulance service and flagged on its system but this data was lost when the trust updated its systems, the inquest heard. Solicitor Peter Collins, representing the Keeling family, read a statement on their behalf, saying that they hoped to set up a charity in Elouise's memory. He said: 'The past two days have been an emotional and testing time for the family. 'Whilst some questions will inevitably remain unawanswerd, they have finally been provided with an account of events that led to the tragic loss of their daughter. 'They hope lessons will be learnt and perhaps other families will be spared the same heartache and devastation that they will always feel as a result of Elouise’s death.' An EEAS spokesman said: 'We have met with Elouise’s family to explain what happened and apologise for the delay in getting an ambulance to her. 'Unfortunately we used a post code rather than a road name. Both RAF Wyton and RAF Brampton had the same postcode despite being some miles apart. 'This meant that we didn’t get an ambulance to Elouise until 15 minutes after the 999 call and despite the efforts of staff including an air ambulance doctor Elouise died. Lost: Three-month-old Bella Hellings died when paramedics took 26 minutes to reach her after she had a fit and got lost again on the way to hospital . 'A full internal investigation has led to a number of changes being made to the way we work to prevent such tragic incidents from happening again. 'This includes new processes for verifying addresses and flagging up concerns more quickly.' The case of Elouise Lessing adds to the mounting criticism against the EEAS regarding delays. Recently, crews were described as 'chaotic' after another coroner heard that three-month-old Bella Hastings had died when paramedics took three times longer than national targets dictate to reach her home in Thetford, Norfolk. Darren Maguire, general manager at EEAS, told the inquest steps had to be taken to improve procedures following the coroner's judgement on Elouise's death. He said: 'We are moving to improve the level of service that we provide.'","Elouise Keeling, 14, collapsed on a sports day at RAF Brampton .

Mr Uzzell’s widow Kate,  48, revealed she was pursuing a  compensation . claim against North Yorkshire County Council after his ‘entirely . avoidable’ death. She said: . ‘It is simply disgraceful that a pothole on such a busy road was allowed . to go unrepaired. This should not have happened. ‘My . husband was an experienced cyclist and was out doing what he loved, . while raising money for charities close to his heart, but it has cost . him his life.’ The tragedy . happened in June 2011 when Mr Uzzell, a service engineer, was cycling . with two friends from Land’s End to John O’Groats to raise money for a . cancer and children’s charity. They . were riding along the A65 road at Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, when Mr . Uzzell hit the pothole and fell into the path of a VW Golf behind him. He suffered devastating head injuries. After . the coroner ruled his death was the result of a road traffic accident, . Mrs Uzzell, of Clevedon, Somerset, said she wanted to know ‘why . something wasn’t done’ when the council had been warned about the . pothole. Local authorities have a legal obligation to keep roads in a . good state, but usually prioritise repairs according to how deep and . dangerous potholes are. Pothole: A section of the A65 Settle Bypass at Giggleswick, North . Yorkshire. Mr Uzzell was travelling along this road when he swerved to hit a pothole and fell into the path of an oncoming car. It . is not known how deep the pothole was when inspected by council staff . five weeks before the tragedy, the inquest heard. Police had called the . council’s customer service team to report the pothole, but the operator . did not pass the information on to the highways department, the inquest . heard. However, a council . inspection was carried out two days later and the hole was ruled not . serious enough for immediate attention. A further inspection was made of . the road before the accident and again no action was taken. Tribute: Mr Uzzell's wife Kate said he an experienced cyclist and who was out doing what he loved, while raising money for charities close to his heart . Mrs Uzzell said: ‘I do not want anyone else to lose a loved one because the roads have not been properly maintained. ‘My . life has been devastated, I have lost my best friend and soul mate, a . lovely person, who bought joy to my life, I am lost and lonely without . Martyn. 'And it isn’t just me, Martyn’s entire family is also suffering . the loss of someone very special.’ Police confirmed Mr Uzzell and his . group had cycled competently, travelling at a reasonable speed with a . good distance from one another and were wearing appropriate clothing.

Joanne Mjadzelics, 38, was arrested as part of Operation Globe, a worldwide investigation into Watkins's child sex activities. The singer, from Pontypridd, was jailed for 35 years at Cardiff Crown Court last year after being found guilty of a string of sex offences, including the attempted rape of an 11-month-old baby. Prosecution: Joanne Mjadzelics, 38, an ex-girlfriend of Paedophile Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins, has been charged with possessing indecent images . Mjadzelics, a former private banking manager with the Royal Bank of Scotland, had an on-off relationship with Watkins from 2006 onwards.

Kirk Thompson, 46, allegedly caused severe internal injuries to David Kochs, 43, during the episode at his home in Jesmond, Newcastle. He then reportedly covered his body with a duvet, before having sex with another man. He pleaded not guilty to charges of manslaughter, unlawful wounding and assault at Newcastle Crown Court today.

During the incident, both men are alleged to have taken the drug crystal meth - before Thomspon reportedly burnt, cut and assaulted his victim, leaving him with severe internal injuries. At some point, he became aware that Mr Kochs was either dead or unconscious - and covered his body with a duvet on the floor of his living room, the court heard. He then allegedly invited another man - who he had also met online - to his home for sex. Robert Smith QC, prosecuting, said Mr Kochs had suffered a 'large number of injuries' during the episode on March 2 last year. He told the jury: 'The case you are to try over the next few weeks as the jury in this trial is an unusual one. It is also a very disturbing one. 'Some of the injuries are likely to have been done with the deceased's agreement as part of sado-masochist sexual activity. 'It is sufficient to say at this stage it involved the use of knives and instruments to burn David Kochs in various areas of his body.' Scene: The former vet reportedly caused severe internal injuries to Mr Kochs during the episode at Dulverton Court (pictured) He then allegedly covered his victim's body with a duvet, before having sex with another man . Appearance: Thompson, pictured arriving at court today, allegedly took the drug crystal meth before the sex session. He is claimed to have burnt, cut and assaulted Mr Kochs, leaving him with severe internal injuries . 'The evidence establishes the defendant clearly enjoyed inflicting pain on others and, in this instance, David Kochs.' Mr Smith added that some of the knife wounds appeared to have been inflicted on Mr Kochs after he had died. The morning after the incident, Thompson messaged his father, saying: 'Can you come . down immediately, something tragic has happened, just you not Mum please . ASAP', the court heard. Case: Thompson pleaded not guilty to charges of manslaughter, unlawful wounding and assault at Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) today. However, he admitted possessing the drug crystal meth. The trial continues . After arriving at the flat, his father quickly dialled 999 - prompting paramedics and police officers to arrive at the scene. They found Mr Kochs lying dead on the . living room floor - partially covered by a duvet and wearing only a pair . of leather ankle boots. Thompson told police that he had engaged in 'extreme, no limits, anything goes' sex with Mr Kochs after taking crystal meth. He added that he had covered the victim with a duvet because he believed he had fallen asleep. Mr Smith said: 'The defendant told a police officer he had engaged in what he described as ""extreme, no limits sex"" with the man. He told the officer what he did was consensual.' Thompson has admitted possessing crystal meth, but denies the other three charges. The trial continues.

Jahangir Nazar is alleged to have been jealous, controlling and possessive - and resentful of his wife, Farkhanda Younis (pictured), having 'many boyfriends'. A 'jealous' husband who stabbed his 'flirtatious' bride to death threatened to kill her a month before, a court heard. Farkhanda Younis, 30, had once been 'head over heels' in love with Jahangir Nazar, 35, but suffered regular violence at his hands, it is alleged. Nazar is alleged to have been jealous, controlling and possessive - and resentful of his 'flirtatious and attractive' wife having 'many boyfriends'. On the night Ms Younis died she had met a previous partner for a lovers' tryst. The prosecution in Nazar's murder trial in Manchester say he believed by marrying her he could secure his stay in Britain. Ms Younis, 30, who was known as 'Jabeen', was found stabbed to death at her home at Bamford Street, Chadderton on April 19 after her young son from a previous relationship called 999. Nazar has admitted manslaughter, but denies murder, saying he was mentally ill at the time. Carla Cutting, a friend of Ms Younis, told the court in a statement she learnt Nazar had killed her from an overheard conversation, three days after it happened. ‘Jabeen was always talking about (Nazar) and showing pictures of him. She was very proud of him and at first seemed head over heels - but their relationship was very stormy. She was talking about splitting up with him but then they would be back together’, Ms Cutting said. ‘The last time I spoke to Jabeen was on Facebook two days before her death. She said she could not talk because 'you know who' (Nazar) was present. I can remember one occasion about a month before Jabeen's death, when I was present when she was speaking to Nazar on her mobile phone. ‘The phone was on loudspeaker so I could hear both sides of the conversation, I could hear them arguing - I heard him threaten to give her a slap and then say: 'I will kill you.' At the time I just thought this had been said in anger, in the heat of the moment, rather than a genuine threat’, she said. Another friend, Abdul Majeed, told Manchester Crown Court he saw Nazar 'hit Jabeen in the face very hard' when he believed she was lying to him about where she had been. Mr Majeed said he and Ms Younis took their children to the same primary school, telling court ‘I have seen her on many occasions with black eyes, every other week or two.' Mr Majeed told court that Ms Younis had told him she was going to leave Nazar and had 'got police involved.' Asked how often he believed she suffered violence from Nazar, Mr Majeed said: ‘It started to become something that was normal in her life.’ Yesterday the court heard Nazar, after stabbing his wife 19 times in the neck, had left Ms Younis’s body in her locked bedroom until her young son called police after failing to rouse her, a jury was told today. Ms Younis was said to have lived ‘an entirely Westernised lifestyle’, the court heard, to the anger of her ‘possessive, controlling’ husband. Police and forensic experts at the scene of the incident in Greater Manchester after Farkhanda Younis's body was found locked in a bedroom on April 19 last year . Hours before her death, she met up . with another man, who was also married, and had sex to ‘celebrate his . birthday’, Manchester Crown Court was told. In . that time, Nazar tried to call her 25 times, but none of the calls was . answered, and he was allegedly ‘lying in wait for her’ when she got . home. The . takeaway delivery driver, who wed Miss Younis in an Islamic ceremony in . 2012 but was not her husband in the eyes of the law, has admitted . manslaughter but denies murder, claiming his responsibility was . diminished by mental illness. However . the prosecution say the behaviour after the killing, when he allegedly . withdrew money, disposed of blood-soaked clothing and filled up his car, . shows a ‘mental agility’ inconsistent with his account. John . Jones QC, opening the case for the prosecution, described Nazar as a . possessive, controlling and violent partner who set up a mobile phone as . a ‘listening device’ to check up on her when he was out. Nazar . was facing deportation and believed that marrying Miss Younis in a . civil ceremony would secure his stay in Britain, he added. ‘It’s . clear that Jabeen and the defendant had entirely different attitudes to . life - it’s clear from others who witnessed the couple that the . defendant was very possessive and very controlling of Jabeen,’ he said. ‘She was far more Westernised, outgoing and one has to say, promiscuous in the conduct of her life, if what other witnesses say about her is correct. ‘That is not said in a critical way - Jabeen was entitled to behave in a way she chose, this is not a court of morals or a judgement on her lifestyle. ‘But, the fact remains that Jabeen lived in every sense an entirely Westernised lifestyle. ‘She went to nightclubs, she had many boyfriends, she drank alcohol and she wore Westernised designer clothing. It’s clear she was a very attractive and flirtatious woman. Farkhanda 'Jabeen' Younis was allegedly stabbed 19 times in a ferocious attack after she had 'birthday sex' with another man, Manchester Crown Court heard . Hours before her death, Miss Younis met up with another man, who was also married, and had sex to 'celebrate his birthday', Manchester Crown Court was told . Nazar, a 35-year-old takeaway delivery driver, has admitted manslaughter but denies murder, claiming his responsibility was diminished by mental illness . ‘Nazar resented it and sought to control it, and on the night in question, it led to uncontrollable rage.’ The court heard Nazar stabbed her 19 times in the neck in a ‘ferocious’ attack at her home in Chadderton, Greater Manchester, in the early hours of April 19 last year. Her body was found after her young son, who cannot be named for legal reasons, rang 999 because he couldn’t rouse her and her bedroom door was locked. Mr Jones described it as ‘a significant attack by a man fearful of deportation, jealous of other men, and resentful of the promiscuity of his girlfriend’. The trial continues.

Con artist: Beijing ticket fraud mastermind Terence Shepherd has been given legal aid despite being a millionaire . A millionaire ticket tout who ripped off Olympic swimmer Rebecca Adlington's parents has been handed legal aid despite failing to pay back £1.3million he owes to his victims. Terence Shepherd, 52, was jailed for eight years in 2011 for selling seats at the 2008 Beijing games that never existed. The scam saw sports fans pay up to 48 times the price of Olympics tickets - but not a single one arrived. The . parents of gold medal-winning swimmer Rebecca Adlington were among . victims from all over the world taken in by the ticket fraud, losing more than £1,000. Shepherd was the mastermind behind the £5million fraud which fooled more than 10,000 customers. After he was convicted he was ordered to pay back more than £1.25million, which is now £1.3million because it has never arrived. But it emerged today he has been given a taxpayer-funded payout to finance an appeal against having his sentence extended for not paying the money back before the deadline of April last year. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) is trying to have up to six years added to his jail term. Despite making attempts to claw back cash the SFO could not explain why it had not taken the £3million home he owns in exclusive Blackheath in south-east London. Commons home affairs select committee chairman Keith Vaz told the Evening Standard that Shepherd was 'playing the system'. 'I am astonished that legal aid has been given to someone who appears to have gained vast wealth through nefarious activities,' he said. 'The Government must follow through on its commitment to end legal aid for wealthy defendants and ensure that those who have committed crimes pay the fines imposed.' Valuable: Shepherd bought this £3million house in Blackheath but has still not paid back any money to his victims . Upset: Retired swimmer Rebecca Adlington's mother and father ordered a number of tickets for Beijing 2008 - which included some of their daughter's greatest moments in the pool - but they never arrived . His defence lawyer David Williams told a hearing at Westminster Magistrates Court that his family would clear his debt by selling three home and 'tables, chairs and paintings'. Shepherd spent most of his money on a luxury life for him and his family. Jailing him Judge Martin Beddoe told Shepherd: “It was a massive, cynical and an entirely dishonest trick, motivated solely by greed and executed as cynically as can be imagined. 'You, Terence Shepherd, clearly received the lion’s share. What you then got your hands on was blown on a catalogue of excess – luxury cars, foreign trips and the extraordinary expenditure of your wife.' Margaret Canty-Shepherd was cleared of money-laundering, although she was said to have received almost £700,000 from one of her husband’s businesses. Scammed: Rebecca Adlington's parents Kay and Steve were cheated out of more than £1,000 as they tried to buy tickets to see their daughter at Beijing 2008 . The judge also made a point of saying in court that she had been one of the main beneficiaries of Shepherd’s fraud. Southwark Crown Court heard that in 18 months she spent £217,000 on luxury items, including jewellery and designer clothing, and £242,000 on travel. They continue to live in a six-bedroom house in Blackheath, one of London’s most desirable suburbs. The couple also regularly enjoyed holidays in Barbados and drove a fleet of expensive cars, including a Bentley, a Porsche and a Mercedes. Prosecutor Marie-Claire Amuah said Shepherd must now provide evidence to show they will pay cash back and 'making a mockery' of the system. She added that they will demand his jail term is extended by several years unless the cash arrives. The case was adjourned because Shepherd was unfit to travel because of an injured calf.","Terence Shepherd, 52, masterminded fraud before 2008 Beijing Olympics .

Record dealer Michael Craig claimed his business would suffer and he would have to move his six-year-old daughter from Dundee High School if he was given the usual totting-up ban . A businessman with 16 points on his licence has been allowed to carry on driving so his daughter can stay in private school. Record dealer Michael Craig claimed his business would suffer and he would have to move his six-year-old daughter from Dundee High School if he was given the usual totting-up ban. Craig – who boasted three months ago about how well his business was doing – claimed it would struggle to survive if he was hit with the six-month disqualification. Perth’s Justice of the Peace Court was told that Craig was already on 12 points when he was clocked speeding on the A9 near the Perthshire village of Greenloaning. The court heard he had escaped a previous ban for hitting the 12-point mark due to an ‘oversight’ by the English court where his previous case was dealt with. Yesterday, Craig, 50, of Longforgan, near Dundee, admitted speeding at 73mph in a van with a limit of 60mph on the A9 Perth to Stirling road on April 24, 2013. Pleading exceptional hardship, Craig said: ‘My daughter is at Dundee High School. My father wanted to pay for her first two years at the High School. ‘She is six. She is in her second year now. The third year intention was we would take over the payments. ‘If my income is cut, it would be difficult for her to continue attending the school and we would have to move her. ‘Or we would need to employ Dundee High School after-school care, which costs more money. I am very worried that my daughter would have to move school. ‘She seems very happy and settled. Financially things would be very difficult. It would almost certainly be impossible.’ Craig said he and his wife Carol, 46, had separated nearly a year ago and he told the court he did not want to add any more disruption to his daughter’s life by moving school. Mrs Craig, who part-owns a chain of day nurseries, said: ‘It would impact on his ability to pay school fees, which would put the burden of that onto me. Craig, who boasted three months ago about how well his business was doing, claimed it would struggle to survive if he was hit with the six-month disqualification and his daughter would have to leave the Dundee High School, pictured . ‘It would be an extra £400 a month. I am committed to my daughter’s schooling. If that’s what I had to do, that would be what I had to do.’ Craig, who runs vinyl record store Unknown Pleasures in Edinburgh’s Royal Mile and an online business, also claimed he would be forced to pay off staff if he was banned. He said: ‘I can’t see any way we could survive a six-month period. The staff would have to be made redundant. ‘Within three months the shop would probably be taking a half to two-thirds of the revenue it’s taking currently.’ Craig, who runs vinyl record store Unknown Pleasures in Edinburgh's Royal Mile and an online business, also claimed he would be forced to pay off staff if he was banned . He said he was the only person capable of touring the country picking up second-hand vinyl as stock for his business. Store manager William Carroll, 60, told the hearing that he was not prepared to travel on his boss’s behalf if Craig had his licence taken away. He said he would expect the shop to fold if Craig was unable to drive. But in November last year, Craig boasted about how well his business was doing after being bombarded by a new wave of vinyl collectors from Russia. He said then: ‘Everyone is talking about the music industry being in turmoil but we’ve had our best-ever year.’ Justice of the Peace Keith Parkes told him: ‘You will not be disqualified from driving but will remain on an excess number of points. You will have to be very careful.’ Craig had four points put on his licence, bringing his total to 16, and was fined £270. Last month a court heard unemployed Keith Baldock, 34, racked up a record 54 penalty points on his licence but was allowed to carry on driving. He begged a judge to let him keep his licence so he could look for work as a mobile tyre fitter. A mistake by the court meant the judge was unaware of Baldock’s previous offences – and that he should already have been banned. Ordinarily, just 12 points are enough for disqualification, but Baldock persuaded the court he was a special case. In a similar case, takeaway driver Ala Udin - who had 29 penalty points on his licence - was  allowed to carry on driving so he could keep his job. Magistrates in Aberystwyth heard he had 11 points on his licence, and was handed another 18 after admitting driving with a defective tyre, speeding and two counts of having no insurance. But they decided not to disqualify him after he told the court his family would not be able to meet mortgage payments if he lost his job.","Record dealer Michael Craig claimed business would suffer if he lost licence .

Precariously parked speed trap vans are putting drivers' lives in danger, driving safety campaigners have warned. An action group believes that rather than making roads safer, the police road safety vans are increasing the risk to motorists on British roads. The Dorset Speed group has compiled a database of the mobile speed cameras parked in seemingly dangerous locations including roadside verges, hard shoulders and slip lanes. Drivers' lives are being put at risk by precariously-parked speed camera vans like this one, according to road safety group, Dorset Speed . Danger: This photo, supplied by road safety group Dorset Speed, shows a van on the side of the A35 near Poole . Campaigners from the group say that most motorists instinctively brake when they see a speed trap . It has been calling for a ban on speed cameras since the death in 2011 of motorcyclist Timothy Rowsell, 64, who crashed his bike and died after braking too hard when he saw a camera van near Bournemouth. In the latest incident, a police vehicle was spotted parked on a concrete verge in front of a safety barrier along the Dorset Way dual carriageway in Poole, Dorset. Ian Belchamber, from Dorset Speed, said: 'This is something that is not uncommon on our roads - police mobile speed camera vans are often spotted parked in dangerous locations. 'Not only does it put the camera operator's life at risk, but any car that crashed on that road would also be prevented from hitting the purpose built safety barrier.' He added: 'We have seen camera cars in slip lanes, half mounted on verges, in cycle lanes, and sometimes just parked on the side of the road. 'The negative effects of speed cameras far outweigh the positive effects, and the result is that the police are making roads more dangerous, not safer.' This speed camera van was photographed parked on the carriageway in Corfe Mullen, Dorset . Poole, Dorset: The road safety group says police speed camera vans are simply putting motorists' lives at risk . He said everybody's immediate reaction on seeing a speed camera was to slam on the brakes, regardless of the speed they were travelling, and added: 'If something isn't done to stop it then there will be more tragic cases like that of Timothy Rowsell.' A Dorset Police spokesman said: 'Safety camera vans perform their duty at authorised locations.'","Road safety group Dorset Speed says motorists brake when they see vans .

Owners of a nursery school have installed a CCTV system so worried parents can check their children are happy while they are at work. Munchkins Kindergarten in Holland-on-Sea, Essex, gives parents a login address and password so they can view their children's room for up to five minutes at a time to reassure themselves that their children are OK. The webcams can be accessed from a computer or smartphone, and while parents are not subjected to police CRB checks, they can only log in on days that their children are in nursery. Reassuring: Parents at Munchkins Day Nursery in Holland-on-Sea in Essex can check up on their children via webcam - here student Ellie-May Lucas, four, shows how the system works . The nursery caters for up to 35 children aged from three months to 11-year-olds, who use the after-school club . Sisters Liz Makins and Jo Callaghan, who run the nursery in Holland-on-Sea, in Essex, say the babycam is there to give parents peace of mind. Mrs Callaghan, 50, who also runs two other nurseries in Essex and one in Kent, said all her parents are delighted to have the chance to check up on their children. She said: 'I have three children of my own and Jo has four so we are quite qualified on the parenting side of things and understand that there is nothing more precious to a parent than their child. 'It is a huge thing for them to leave their children with us because after all we are strangers at the beginning, so this enables them to log on and watch their children having fun.' Access to the webcam footage automatically shuts off after five minutes, to avoid parents leaving it playing on their work computer and wandering off, allowing others to view it. And staff at the nursery, which caters for up to 35 children aged from three months to 11 years in the after-school club, regularly monitor parents' usage of it to make sure no-one is accessing it particularly often. Manager June Oliver, left,with Ellie-May, and co-owner Liz Makins, right, say parents are fans of the webcams . All-seeing eye: Staff at the nursery say they forget the cameras are there - nappies are changed off-camera . Mrs Callaghan said she first installed a babycam at one of her other nurseries three and a half years ago. She said: 'We haven't had one parent complain or say they don't like it, and why would they?  We have nothing to hide.' And she said she didn't ask parents for CRB checks before allowing them access 'for one very good reason - all nappy changing, and clothes changing, if necessary, is done off camera.' 'We haven't had one parent complain or say they don't like it and would they?  We have nothing to hide.' Munchkins co-owner Jo Callaghan . She said her staff had never complained that the cameras meant they couldn't slack off, and said everyone forgets the cameras are there. Mrs Callaghan said many nurseries had private CCTV systems, visible only to nursery bosses, for security reasons, but insisted allowing parents to view it as well was only a good thing. She said: 'There is the occasional squabble that a parent might see and they might ring us up about it but that is rare - I would say it happens only about once a year in all of our nurseries as the children are so happy and busy.' The first nursery webcams allowing parents to view their children from outside computers were introduced in Britain at the beginning of the century. Researchers said they were popular as they allowed parents to feel they were 'protecting' their children, but critics said they were taking the concept of Big Brother too far.","Parents at Munchkins day nursery can check up on their children online .
