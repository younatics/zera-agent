"(Mashable) -- Social payments are taking a giant leap forward. PayPal has unveiled a Facebook app that lets you send money to friends. The app, simply titled Send Money, is just as straightforward as its name. You have the choice to send either an ecard with money or just money with no card. You select a card, choose a friend to send it to and then select how much money to send. ""The PayPal and Facebook infrastructure have now merged,"" PayPal's Anuj Nayar says. ""This is another way to personalize the act of giving money."" While there are several ways to pay with PayPal via Facebook (Payvment comes to mind), this is the first app to enable peer-to-peer payments via Facebook and PayPal. And because it's a peer-to-peer transaction, there is no transaction fee, though PayPal's regular limits and international fees still apply. ""Sending money, person to person, is free,"" PayPal Senior Product Marketing Manager JB Coutinho said. ""If it's funded by a PayPal balance or linked to a bank account, it's free."" And while the primary aspect of the Send Money app is its enablement of transactions across the world's largest social network, the ecard aspect is being emphasized as well. PayPal was quick to point out that more than 500 million ecards are sent every year, and that's why PayPal is offering dozens of choices for everything from birthdays to congratulations. We can see the app really taking off. Users who see on Facebook that it's a friend's birthday can quickly fire up the app and send a card and some cash within a few minutes. The app is just as useful for things like lottery pools and reimbursing friends for lunch. It's a big step toward making social payments a reality. If you want to learn more about the PayPal Send Money Facebook App, we've created a simple walkthrough of the payment process. Check it out in this gallery, and let us know what you think of the app in the comments. See the original article on Mashable.com . © 2011 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- The trouble with boxing is, people get hurt. Some time soon, according to ""Real Steel,"" the sport will get a radical technological upgrade and human pugilists will be replaced by robots; combatants who will fight to the death every time they climb into the ring. In a sport like that the machines might get the glory, but you will still find human interest in the corner, where trainers have been replaced by computer programmers, engineers, welders, and if you go down far enough, old fashioned managers like Charlie (Hugh Jackman), an ex-boxer so deep in debt he's nearly out for the count. Reunited with the 11-year-old son he's practically forgotten, Charlie promptly sells him to the boy's aunt and uncle. But the boy won't be sidelined quite so easily. He's a fight fan himself, and he means to go on the road with his old man and more importantly with the junkyard sparring bot ""Atom"" he rescues from scrap. This is ""Transformers"" for kids, basically -- and yes, I appreciate you might think ""Transformers"" would have that demographic covered, but apparently nobody told Michael Bay, who pitched his three movies at teens and up. ""Night at the Museum"" director Shawn Levy does not make the same mistake. Although it's rated PG-13 for some mildly adult language and robot-on-robot violence (and I think we can be sure that no robots were harmed in the course of this film), ""Real Steel"" is fundamentally about a son reconnecting with his dad, something Levy never lets us forget for long. It's as corny as Kansas, but the mix of old fashioned heart and new fangled animatronic cyber tech will make this picture a winner for fathers and sons (Levy has squeezed in a cameo for his three young daughters, but the female characters are mostly relegated to cheering from the stands). Hugh Jackman is doing a minor variation on his Logan signature tune, but for the best part of the movie he lets the obnoxiously talented Dakota Goyo as his son runs rings around him, stealing one scene after another. It's an uneven fight -- rigged by screenwriter John Gatins, aided and abetted by Levy -- but it's fun to see the kid make a chump of the champ. Surprisingly, Levy resists turning Atom into an autonomous character. He does have some neat features though. He's smaller and weaker than most of his competition, with pale blue bulbs for eyes beneath what looks like a fencing mask. But he can take a beating and in ""shadow mode"" he mimics his coach's movements with lightning speed. He can dance too -- like a six-foot, three-ton butterfly. Robots aside, Levy doesn't go in for futurism really. The locations are steeped in the heartland: a cavernous boxing gym that smacks of the 1920s. Charlie's truck looks like something out of a 1940s film. Neon motel signs, back-country roads, and an old Detroit auto plant repurposed as a post-industrial sports arena. There's a broader nostalgia at work here, as if the fight's gone out of the whole country and one plucky kid and his pet robot could galvanize the whole show. Did they really need to fall back on xenophobic shorthand to pump up the climactic bout, when Atom takes on Zeus, a robot combining Asian know-how and Russian money? And couldn't someone have called time on the over-the-top product placement that clogs up the finale? In the end, ""Real Steel"" won't win any prizes for innovation, but it works -- it's a technical knockout.","""Real Steel"" stars Hugh Jackman as a struggling boxing promoter .

"(CNN) -- Worries about high tides overwhelming parts of Thailand in recent days have morphed into fears about water- and insect-borne diseases in the flood-ravaged country. Bangkok's central business district has avoided major flooding so far, but outlying areas are chest- or waist-deep in water. ""The water in those parts is a filthy black color containing sewage, garbage and dead animals with a nasty smell. Mosquitoes are also breeding rapidly,"" said Igor Prahin of Bangkok. More than 370 people have died since the flooding began after heavy monsoon rains. U.S. Ambassador to Thailand Kristie A. Kenney said Monday that ""the worst may be over for central Bangkok,"" but about 2 million people are still affected by the flooding. The United States has pledged a total of $1.1 million in aid. CNNGo: Updated travel information for tourists . Charities working in the country have warned of diseases such as diarrhea, dengue fever and malaria in the coming days and weeks. ""There are places on the outskirts of Bangkok and in other parts of the country which have been flooded for nearly two weeks,"" said Matthew Cochrane of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. ""The country's prime minister has said that the city has 'dodged a bullet' -- the economic impact of central Bangkok being flooded would have been huge, and thankfully that did not happen -- but a huge part of the country is still under water,"" Cochrane said. ""Outside the city it is certainly a humanitarian crisis, because there are people who have been cut off for weeks without any aid, supplies or food."" UNICEF said it was providing 20,000 mosquito nets and handing out 20,000 pamphlets explaining how to stay safe and healthy in flood-stricken regions. Supatra (Jenstitvong) Assavasuke, who lives east of central Bangkok, took in two friends whose house on the west side of the city is submerged under 1 to 2 meters (3 to 7 feet) of water. It's unclear how long they will need to stay. She and her family have helped donate about 3,000 liters (almost 800 gallons) of drinking water to those in worse-off areas. ""Those who got affected, they lose their houses, they lose their jobs, their cars -- many things,"" she said. But even those in the capital faced possible shortages of water. The Metropolitan Waterworks Authority said it had reduced the amount of tap water processed for residents from 900,000 to 400,000 cubic meters per day, because of high algae counts at one of its plants. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra said authorities would speed up the process of draining water into Bangkok's canals and into the sea, raising hopes that water levels in the city could start to sink. However, the government has warned it may take more than a month for the floods to recede. Already, the flooding has caused an estimated $6 billion in damages, the Thai Finance Ministry has said. The Thai government has set up more than 1,700 shelters across the country, where more than 113,000 people have taken refuge. Yet many are trying to push through with their daily routines. In Bangkok's Chinatown area, a food vendor up to her knees in murky water continued to serve patrons at her small cart. One resident traveled down a street by row boat as a nearby bicyclist pedaled through thigh-deep flooding. And a man walked his dog near Bangkok's Grand Palace, the dog chest-deep in water. CNN's Bryony Jones, Kocha Olarn and Germain Perez contributed to this report.","2 million people are affected by the flooding, a U.S. diplomat to Thailand says .

"(Health.com) -- Sitting in an L.A. cafÃ©, I see no sign of Michelle Monaghan, 35, whose career has soared since playing Tom Cruise's love interest in ""Mission: Impossible III."" Could it be that the famously down-to-earth star -- who grew up in Winthrop, Iowa, Population: 850 -- has turned diva? Just then, a redhead in the back waves (she has dyed her hair for a role). Soon, all worries about her having gone Hollywood vanish. Sipping mint tea, she talks workouts, health scares, and her secret weapon for PMS. Q: In your new film, Machine Gun Preacher, you play the wife of an ex-drug-addict-turned-evangelist who crusades to protect Sudanese children from the horrors of war. What drew you to it? When I was growing up, my parents took in foster children. From a young age, I learned that there are a lot of children in need. I am a firm believer that you can make a difference in someone's life -- whether they're thousands of miles away, or on your own block. Q: How has your childhood put your Hollywood life into perspective? I come from a very working class background. My dad worked in a factory for 40 years. We all put ourselves through school. So I've never felt entitled to anything. Q: Your daughter, Willow, is 3. What did you do to get your body back in shape after having her? I started with ab work, since after pregnancy the abs are shot. For the first time, I enjoyed working out: It was having that reprieve for an hour of alone time. It gave me more energy. Health.com: 6 rules for a healthy postpartum slim down . Q: How do you stay in shape these days? I do squats, lunges, strength training. I ran a half-marathon in April with my cousins, mom, and aunts. It was amazing. After that, we had big plans to do the Chicago Marathon, but two weeks later, we were asking, ""Are we really going to do it, or were we just on a runner's high?"" I haven't run since! Q: What is the toughest part of working out for you? Just getting there! I've gotten down the stairs and thought: workout or post office? It's either physical torture or mental torture. So sometimes I go with the mental torture and stand in line at the post office in my workout gear. Q: What body part are you proudest of? I have nice muscle tone in my arms. I can't really take credit for it, though -- all the members of my family do. A lot of arm wrestling happened in our family growing up! Health.com: Get gorgeous arms . Q: Do you have any body challenges? The old bum and thigh area. I hope most women agree with me! [Laughs.] Keeping it toned, dealing with cellulite. I hate when I feel it move after me. Q: Any health regrets? I smoked for almost 10 years. I really regret that. Thankfully, I came out on the other side. I hope my lungs are repairing themselves now. Q: You've known your husband [Australian graphic designer Peter White] for nearly 11 years. Do you find he ""gets"" you? He gets me on every level. During ""that time of the month,"" he knows to bring me a Snickers bar. He's good like that! And a few years ago I had a mole on the back of my calf, and he was adamant that I get it checked. In Australia, they're very aware of skin cancer. I finally went and it was skin cancer. I had quite the chunk taken out of my leg. I'm so grateful he noticed it. I clearly now realize he has a keen eye and wonder what other imperfections he's noticing! [Laughs.] . Health.com: Is it a mole...or skin cancer? Q: So, cosmetic surgery -- for or against? I don't think it's for me. The acting that I respect is about conveying emotion without really speaking. I'm not saying I jump for joy when I see new laugh lines, but I would try every possible recourse before going under the knife. Q: With all you juggle, how do you stay in touch with your sensual side? A new bra goes a long way -- and when I say a new bra, I mean a real treat, like one from La Perla. Not the matching sets; I like to mix and match. And if I can finagle a foot massage, I will give you the moon.

"(EW.com) -- The box office had to contend with the World Series, a very early snowstorm in the Northeast, and Halloween festivities across the country this weekend, but audiences still managed to make it to the movies! That being said, grosses for new releases ""Puss in Boots,"" ""In Time,"" and ""The Rum Diary,"" weren't all that strong. Check out how they performed below: . Dreamworks Animation's ""Puss in Boots"" was the top cat this weekend, clawing its way to a $34 million debut, 51 percent of which came from 3-D screens, and 7 percent of which was from IMAX theaters. On paper, that number sounds good -- and, to be clear, it is by no means a disaster -- but the result comes with a ""Real Steel""-ish caveat. ""Puss in Boots"" cost $130 million to produce, and it earned Dreamworks' third-worst debut for a computer animated film, beating only ""Flushed Away"" and ""Antz,"" which started with $18.8 million and $17.2 million, respectively. The 3-D ""Shrek""-spinoff, cost as much as Dreamworks' ""Megamind,"" which opened in early November 2010, but that film began with $46 million, and it played well through the Thanksgiving season on its way to a $148.4 million total. ""Puss in Boots"" entered theaters a week earlier, but it will need to endure even better than ""Megamind"" to earn back its budget. The ""A-"" CinemaScore grade it earned from audiences should at least make that achievement possible, but considering people are already familiar with the ""Puss in Boots"" character, it's doubtful that the film will attract many uninitiated viewers. We won't officially know where ""Puss in Boots"" is headed until next weekend, when we see how much the snowstorm, the World Series, and Halloween really affected the box office this frame. (My guess is not much -- and I'm not just being catty.) Second place belonged to ""Paranormal Activity 3,"" which fell by 65 percent to $18.5 million in its second weekend. The found footage horror sequel has scared up $81.3 million after ten days in theaters, and considering the huge business the film will likely do on Halloween, ""PA3"" is only a day away from passing Paranormal Activity 2's $84.8 million cume. Not too shabby for a film that cost Paramount only $5 million to make! Fall Movies: Get the latest news, photos, and more . Fox's $40 million Justin Timberlake/Amanda Seyfried thriller ""In Time"" underwhelmed with just $12 million in its opening weekend. That debut is less than Timberlake's last film, ""Friends with Benefits,"" which began with $18.6 million on its way to $55.8 million, as well as Seyfried's recent ""Red Riding Hood,"" which debuted with $14 million on its way to $37.6 million. Ads for ""In Time"" failed to effectively communicate the convoluted time-shifting story, and negative reviews likely kept older moviegoers away. Timberlake's leading man status may not have helped matters too much, either -- audiences seem to find him more appealing as part of an ensemble, like in ""The Social Network"" and ""Bad Teacher."" Moviegoers issued ""In Time"" an unenthusiastic ""B-"" CinemaScore grade, which may prevent the film from finding the same kind of legs that time-jumping thriller ""Source Code"" ($14.8 million opening, $54.7 million total) enjoyed earlier this year. In its third weekend, dancing remake ""Footloose"" fell to fourth place, dropping 48 percent to $5.4 million. The $24 million production has now earned $38.5 million after 17 days in theaters, and it will pass the total of Julianne Hough's first feature film, ""Burlesque"" ($39.4 million), sometime this week. Johnny Depp's latest, ""The Rum Diary,"" stumbled out of the gate with just $5 million. ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" this was not. The disappointing opening fell in line with Depp's other substance abuse picture, 1998â€²s ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,"" which debuted to $3.3 million and earned $10.7 million total. ""The Rum Diary's"" edgy story was always going to be a tough sell, and FilmDistrict's President of Theatrical Distribution Bob Berney admits: ""While we all wish the numbers were better, we're proud of the film and its loving tribute to Hunter S. Thompson."" The $50 million picture marks the third straight box office disappointment for FilmDistrict, the young distributor that found success with Insidious ($54 million) earlier this year. The studio has since struggled with both ""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark"" ($23.9 million) and ""Drive"" ($33.7 million so far) recently. Unfortunately for FilmDistrict, audiences, which were 88 percent above the age of 25, gave ""The Rum Diary"" a harsh ""C"" CinemaScore grade, so it's not likely to hold well in future weeks. Talk about a bad hangover... In limited release, Sony's Shakespeare tale ""Anonymous"" started with $1 million out of 256 theaters. That was good enough for a $3,774 per theater average, which does not merit huge expansions in the coming weeks. Young romance ""Like Crazy"" fared better, grossing $120,000 out of only 4 theaters, resulting in a $30,000 average. Richard Gere's latest, ""The Double,"" was D.O.A., pulling in only $27,545 out of 11 theaters. It's not likely to platform much further. Zeitgeist-y Wall Street thriller ""Margin Call"" continued to play fairly well, grossing $713,000 out of 140 theaters. It has earned $1.5 million so far. Internationally, ""The Adventures of Tintin"" got off to an excellent start. Sony's motion capture animation grossed $55.8 million out of 19 territories, including $21.5 million in France and $10.7 million in the United Kingdom, where its being distributed by Paramount. Sony is bragging loudly about the film's performance, perhaps in response to some prognosticators claiming that ""Tintin"" is likely to underperform domestically. (The picture is based on a series of comic books by HergÃ© which were very popular in Europe, but only cult hits in the U.S.) We'll find out how excited audiences are about ""Tintin"" on December 21. 1.

"(CNN) -- Almost nine years into the basketball legend's retirement, a new version of Michael Jordan athletic shoes can still send fans into a mad frenzy: Stores nationwide were the scenes of violence and police officer injuries Friday, authorities said. In Richmond, California, police investigated a gunshot fired outside a mall where the latest version of shoes named after Jordan went on sale for about $180 a pair Friday morning, police told CNN affiliate KGO. A 24-year-old Richmond man was taken into custody in connection with the gunfire, said police Lt. Lori Curran. ""It appears right now it may have been just a negligent discharge,"" Curran said. Even as early as 1990, a new pair of Air Jordans was so coveted that youngsters became violent in stealing the shoes. Jordan and his Chicago Bulls won six NBA championships in the 1990s. Thursday evening in Austin, Texas, three Foot Locker stores each drew 1,000 people for a midnight sale of the new Air Jordan Retro XI, replicas of a 1996 version of the shoe, and police shut down one mall when two police officers were injured, CNN affiliate KVUE reported. Police said each store had only 150 pairs of the shoes, the station reported. One of the officers was taken to a hospital after he was rushed by the crowd and suffered bruises and a rolled ankle, KVUE said. Police are reviewing surveillance tapes to find the assailant, police said, according to the station. ""It's been crazy,"" one woman shopper named Andrea told KVUE, adding that officers threatened to use mace on crowds. ""People have been trying to run over the officers to get in the building."" At a suburban Seattle mall Friday, police used pepper spray to bring order to an unruly crowd of 2,000 shoppers seeking the new shoe, said Mike Murphy of the Tukwila, Washington, Police Department. The Seattle area store wasn't prepared to handle such a large crowd, Murphy said. CNN affiliate KIRO reported that crowds lined up Thursday night for the sale, which started at 4 a.m. Friday. In Lithonia, Georgia, police took four people into custody after a mall's doors were damaged, CNN affiliate WSB reported. Also, police questioned a mother who witnesses said left her kids, ages 2 and 5, in a car as she went into the mall to buy the shoes, WSB reported. In Charlotte, North Carolina, police were called to three malls after crowds became rowdy, CNN affiliate WCNC reported. At one mall, customers pried open a door at 6 a.m. Friday, and one person was arrested for resisting an officer, the station reported. In Taylor, Michigan, a Detroit man was charged with attempting to incite a riot after 300 people became unruly waiting for the mall to open Friday morning, police Cmdr. Mary Sclabassi told CNN. In Louisville, Kentucky, public safety dispatchers said they received a report of 75 to 100 people in a fight over the shoes at a mall, CNN affiliate WDRB reported. In Indianapolis, Indiana, police dispatchers said officers at the mall were ""having problems"" after the shoes apparently sold out, and additional officer were sent to help manage the crowd of about 300 people, CNN affiliate WISH said. The crowd ripped doors off their hinges, police said, according to WISH. On Friday afternoon, eBay was featuring new pairs of the Air Jordan Retro XI selling between $219.99 and $510.","Police officers are injured; some are forced to use pepper spray .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Most adults have a warm spot in their hearts for LEGOs, the colorful interlocking building toys. The iconic name conjures up images of creative creatures and thought-provoking things built by imagination. On a recent January weekend, LEGO held a job fair of sorts in the form of a contest, a two-day building contest called Brick Factor. The winner was awarded a full-time position of master model builder at the new LEGOLAND Discovery Center due to open in Atlanta in the spring. There were plenty of LEGO lovers interested. People like Megan Sims. ""Of course it's a dream job,"" she said. ""You get to play with LEGOs and kids all day. Who wouldn't want that job?"" Joshua Bohn, a college student who is a self-proclaimed lifelong LEGO enthusiast, said that among LEGO lovers this job is coveted among all others. The master model builder for LEGOLAND Discovery Center Dallas agrees. ""It's an important job"" said Cal Walsh. ""The job is responsible for all the LEGO bricks in the Discovery Center"". Walsh also got his job by winning a contest. He said working for the company is like getting paid to play. The Atlanta contestants were narrowed down on the first day by several rounds of tasks, or builds. In the first, competitors built an animal in 45 minutes. This gave birth to lions, ducks, fish and alligators. There were even some angry birds. Build two was a little more complex; the contestants were charged with building an Atlanta icon. Entries included Ray Charles singing, the immensely popular Peachtree road race and the Fox Theatre, a well-known Midtown entertainment venue. Twelve contestants were selected for the finals, in which they created a model that best described them. They had one hour. Zack Cole, an architecture student, knew immediately he would build a guitar, but he wasn't the only one. ""I know someone else is making a guitar, I guess ill have to make mine better."" Sims, a mother of two and the only woman left, chose to build Wonder Woman. ""As a mom, sometimes I feel I need to be a superhero to get things done."" Bohn's homage to theater, a stage scene depicting Romeo and Juliet, was selected the winner. ""I feel like I was when I was 3 or 4, when I got my first LEGO set,"" Bohn said.","LEGO contest winner will receive job at new Atlanta Discovery Center .

"(CareerBuilder.com) -- It can be tough to pinpoint exactly what the term ""personal brand"" means, especially when it's loosely used to describe everything from professional image, to manner of dress, to online reputation. While this broad definition may make the term seem like just another empty business buzzword -- developing a personal brand can actually be a great get-ahead strategy for both job seekers and those looking to advance their careers. So what exactly is a personal brand? According to Dan Schawbel, author of ""Me 2.0: 4 Steps to Building Your Future"" and owner of PersonalBrandingBlog.com, ""A personal brand is what you stand for and what makes you special. [It's] composed of values, a mission, and a positioning statement that depict what you do and who your audience is. [It] is an indicator for how valuable you are to employers and customers at every stage of your career."" Your personal brand also encompasses the way you market yourself to your professional community, whether it be via your résumé, your LinkedIn profile, your manner of speaking or, yes, even the way you dress. While creating a personal brand may seem daunting, chances are, you've already started building one. Here's what you need to know in order to expand upon, shape and make use of the personal brand you're already creating. Careerbuilder.com: Five tips for confidently speaking up at meetings . Define your brand . First and foremost, you need to decide what you want your personal brand to convey about you. According to Schawbel, ""Your personal brand should represent something that is unique to you; your personality, your passions, your talents and your dream goal. Ask yourself: 'What do I want to be known for?'"" For instance, if you've spent most of your career as a human resources manager in the financial world, and your ultimate goal is to become the vice president of human resources at an investment bank, then your personal brand needs to send the message that you're an expert and a leader in the areas of HR, management and finance. Market your brand . Once you decide upon your professional goals and values, it's time to start letting others know about them. This may seem like an odd concept at first -- especially for those who have trouble tooting their own horn, so to speak -- but there are plenty of ways to subtly start getting your new message out there. The Internet is a good place to start establishing both visibility and a strong personal brand, Schawbel says. ""[Take] ownership of your online presence because that is where almost all first impressions now occur. Start your own blog or website under your full name, as well as accounts on Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn. Then, add your bio information to each and start reaching out to people in your industry using the tools. By constantly getting your name, face and valuable content out there, you will start to build and shape your brand, which will turn into opportunities,"" he says. On LinkedIn and Facebook, for example, that may mean joining groups that reflect your professional goals. On Twitter, that means tweeting about what's going on in your field instead of your plans for the weekend. If you have a blog, update it regularly with posts and insights on your industry. CareerBuilder.com: Favorite on-screen work nemeses . Be consistent . ""Think about how you dress, how you behave, what you publish online -- and what that says about who you are,"" Schawbel says. All of these things should be consistent with the message your personal brand is trying to send. For example, if your goal is to reach an executive-level position in the next five years; highlight your leadership qualities on your résumé, follow corporate leaders on Twitter, offer to spearhead new projects at work and dress like you're already in the executive position you're aiming towards. ""Your brand should be consistent because you never know how someone might find you,"" Schawbel says. Look at how others are branding you . To gauge the effectiveness of the brand you've created for yourself, evaluate how others see you -- and whether it's in line with the image you want to project. ""You know you're communicating your brand effectively when your self-impression is equal to how people perceive you,"" Schawbel says. ""One way to find out this information is to see how people categorize you on Twitter, with Twitter lists. If you're a personal finance expert, but people put you in real estate lists, you have a real problem."" If you're not on Twitter, asking colleagues or friends to sum up your professional image in a sentence or two will help you evaluate whether you're branding yourself properly. The bottom line, Schawbel says, is that ""By building your brand throughout your career, you protect yourself from the unpredictable nature of the economy, and gain more career options and opportunities.""

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigeria imposed a 24-hour curfew Saturday in the northern city of Kano after assailants killed scores of people and wounded others in a hail of gunfire and coordinated bombings of eight government sites. A military official told CNN that at least 156 people were dead and feared the number would rise. ""The hospitals are not equipped to deal with the influx and severity of the injuries, so we are expecting that figure to go up further,"" the official said. Nwankpa Nwankpa, a Red Cross information officer in the capital, Abuja, said 50 people were injured in the attacks. He said that search and rescue operations are underway and volunteers are working to assist those hurt. The attacks targeted several police stations, barracks and the building housing the assistant inspector general of police in Kano, Nigeria's second largest city. A passport office, state security headquarters and the immigration office were also hit, police said. Are you there? Share your story . Terrified residents barricaded themselves in their homes, said Rev. Murtala Mati of the Christian Association of Nigeria. ""The government is really trying but we are afraid ... we are all scared,"" he said. During the attack, assailants entered a police station, freed detainees and bombed it, authorities said. They later canvassed the area in a car led by motorcycles, spraying targets with gunfire. Islamist group Boko Haram claimed responsibility for the blast in a phone call to the Daily Trust, according to journalists at the newspaper. Nigeria closed its borders Saturday with Cameroon and Niger, whom it has accused of allowing the militants to move freely into Nigeria. The government has put in place a state of emergency, and a large deployment of troops has been sent to the north of the country. African Union commission chairman Jean Ping condemned ""in the strongest terms"" the attacks Saturday, and expressed his condolences to the families of those killed and his concern for the many people who were injured. The AU rejects terrorism in all its forms, the statement said, and gives Nigeria its full backing in its efforts to end terror attacks. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is ""appalled at the frequency and intensity of recent attacks in Nigeria, which demonstrate a wanton and unacceptable disregard for human life,"" his office said Saturday in a statement. ""In voicing solidarity with the government and people of Nigeria, the secretary-general also expresses his hope for swift and transparent investigations into these incidents that lead to bringing the perpetrators to justice,"" the statement added. In December, Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan declared a state of emergency in four northern states. The declaration followed a series of Christmas Day attacks on Christian churches blamed on the Boko Haram group. The man suspected of masterminding those attacks, named Kabiru Sokoto, was briefly captured this week before escaping police custody while being transferred to another prison. Several police officers and the local commissioner are under investigation over his escape. A 50 million naira ($307,000) reward was also offered by police Thursday for any information leading to Sokoto's re-arrest. Northern Nigeria has been wracked by religious violence in recent weeks, including a spate of attacks in early January that killed at least 25 Christians. Boko Haram has been blamed for months of widespread bloodshed, with churches and police stations among the targets. CNN's David McKenzie contributed to this report.","NEW: The U.N.'s Ban Ki-moon is ""appalled at the frequency and intensity"" of recent attacks .

"Paris (CNN) -- The French government backed off a claim that a certain type of silicone breast implant is linked to a rare form of cancer, but it will nonetheless pay for women to have them removed because of other risks. Women with implants by a company called Poly Implant Prosthese (PIP) will not be required to get them removed, but they will be offered surgery to do so if concerned, the French Health Ministry said Friday. The ministry says about 30,000 French women have PIP implants, which are not currently approved for use in the United States. According to a news release from the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, PIP is now defunct. It says the company ""used non-medical grade silicone believed by the manufacturers to be made for mattresses."" The Ministry of Health turned to experts after the cancer fears arose and said that the feedback they received was that there is no increased cancer risk in women with PIP implants compared to other implants. However, the ministry said in a statement, there are other established risks such as ruptures. The French government agency that evaluates the safety of medical products says 523 women have had them removed since a defect was discovered last year. More than 1,000 implants have ruptured since then, the agency says. ""These experts said that there is no link between cancer and ... PIP implant breasts. However, since there is a lot of ruptures, (concerns) are growing because the nature of the implant is no good,"" said Jean Yves Grall, the country's director of health. FranÃ§ois Godineau, director of social security, said it would cost the state up to 60 million euros (U.S. $73 million) if they paid for the removal of the PIP breast implants in France. Of the 30,000 women who have the implants, 80% underwent the surgery for esthetic reasons, and 20% did so for reconstructive reasons, such as after breast cancer. Under the state's offer, the women with the implants will be offered to have the implants removed, but it will not pay for new implants for those who had the surgery for esthetic reasons. Others would have new implants paid for. CNN's Saskya Vandoorne contributed to this report.","Experts alleviated cancer fears linked to a certain breast implant .

"(CNN) -- To say that ""Real Housewives of New York City"" star Ramona Singer is busy would be an understatement. Between her different businesses -- wine, jewelry and skin-care products -- and the time she spends filming the Bravo reality show, Singer is hardly ever in the same location for very long. But Singer's passion remains with New York City, where she still manages to spend most of her time. A busy lifestyle doing what she loves suits Singer just fine, and New York is the best place for her. The buzz of the city is what Singer loves most. ""You can be all by yourself and you walk out on the street and then you're not alone, but surrounded by tons of people. It just has such great energy."" Here, Singer shares some of her favorite locations in New York City. Where to eat . T-Bar Steak & Lounge 1278 Third Avenue . A swanky spot on the Upper East Side, T-Bar is known for its flair and of course, its steaks. Grabbing a cocktail here is an easy way for Singer to unwind. ""I love this restaurant and it's in my neighborhood. It's a place I can go by myself and get a bite to eat. I can go with girlfriends, I can go with my husband, they have a great area where you can just hang out and have drinks and appetizers or a whole meal. It just has a nice vibe, a nice local place."" The Standard Grill  848 Washington Street . With a wide variety of menus from breakfast to ""late night,"" The Standard Grill  offers items from a $1 ""good pickle"" to the $95 porterhouse steak for two. The restaurant is at the bottom of the trendy Standard Hotel, under the High Line Park. Singer makes tracks to the hotel's 18th floor, where the Top of the Standard lounge (also known as the Boom Boom Room) offers a fun mix of decadence and hip 70s throwback atmosphere. ""I can go on top and have drinks at the Boom Boom Room -- very art deco, chic, a must-see place. The view is floor-to-ceiling glass, absolutely beautiful. It's breathtaking."" Where to shop . Bergdorf Goodman Fifth Avenue . A store with history and designer finds unlike any other, Bergdorf Goodman is like a one-stop shop for Singer, who has little time for shopping. The variety and helpful sales staff makes this one of her top places in New York. ""They have great sales and a great selection. And unlike something you buy in one of the boutiques, you can return it -- because once in a blue moon, I do make a mistake. I love the Sixth floor, they have all of the contemporary designers, like Milly, Rebecca Taylor, Theory. ""I'm always on the go: traveling, running, doing, multi-tasking. I need a place I feel really comfortable, where I get great service and has a great selection."" Michael Kors 790 Madison Avenue . A jewelry designer, Singer can appreciate affordable, fantastic fashion. Michael Kors' new line of accessories is a favorite of Singer and her daughter, with a wide range of watches for about $250.

Favorite spot in Central Park . The Central Park Boathouse East 60th Street . When Singer needs an escape, she visits the Boathouse for its relaxing scenery, good eats and recreation. ""It's the best-kept secret in New York, beyond stunning and gorgeous. It's on the water, so you can have lunch or dinner outside along the waterfront. You can also ride bikes there or grab a bite from a concession stand.""","Ramona Singer doesn't always have time to shop, but she loves Bergdorf Goodman .

"(CNN) -- The Marine Corps has dropped charges against the commander of the Marine company involved in the 2005 killings of Iraqi civilians in Haditha, Iraq. Camp Pendleton's commanding officer ordered charges dropped against Capt. Lucas McConnell. Capt. Lucas McConnell, who had been charged with dereliction of duty, was also granted immunity to ensure he cooperates with the investigation, the service said Tuesday. McConnell was one of four officers charged with failing to properly investigate and report the civilian deaths. Lt. Gen. James Mattis, the Marine commander in charge of the corps' units in the Middle East, ordered the charges dismissed last week. ""Lt. Gen. Mattis determined that administrative measures are the appropriate response for any errors or omissions allegedly committed by McConnell,"" according to a statement from the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton in California. Four Marines from McConnell's unit were charged with murder in connection with the deaths of up to two dozen civilians in Haditha in November 2005. Charges have been dropped against two of them -- one in exchange for his testimony and the other after a hearing officer decided he acted in accord with the rules of engagement. Two other officers -- Lt. Col. Jeffrey Chessani, the battalion commander, and 1st Lt. Andrew Grayson -- also face charges related to their response to the killings. Haditha, located along the Euphrates River northwest of Baghdad, was the target of several Marine campaigns aimed at rooting out insurgents from 2004 through 2006. Prosecutors accused the Marines of going on a rampage after a roadside bomb killed one of their comrades, 20-year-old Lance Cpl. Miguel Terrazas, on November 19, 2005. A statement from the Marine Corps originally blamed the deaths on the roadside bomb, triggering a parallel investigation into how commanders handled the incident. E-mail to a friend .","Capt.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Four southern California teenagers have been charged following the apparent drug overdose death of an 18-year-old high school quarterback whose father is a retired NFL player, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said Saturday. Three of the teens have been charged with involuntary manslaughter in the death of Griffen Kramer, son of former pro quarterback Erik Kramer, who played for several NFL teams including the Chicago Bears and Detroit Lions, officials said. Griffen Kramer played quarterback at Thousand Oaks High School, which lists him as a 6-foot 210-pound senior. Kramer was found dead October 30 in a friend's bedroom in Agoura Hills, the sheriff's office said in a statement. That friend, David Nemberg, 19, of Agoura Hills, is charged with involuntary manslaughter and possession of a controlled substance, authorities said. After investigating several of Kramer's acquaintances who were involved in narcotics-related activities, police also charged Corey Baumann, 19, also of Agoura Hills, with involuntary manslaughter and possession of a controlled substance for sales, the sheriff's office said. Baumann and Nemberg were each released in lieu of a $125,000 bail, authorities said. The two other accused teenagers are minors, whose names weren't released, the sheriff's office said. A 17-year-old boy from Oak Park, California, was charged with involuntary manslaughter and possession of a controlled substance, the sheriff's office said. He is being held at Sylmar Juvenile Hall without bail, authorities said. Investigators found ""deplorable"" living conditions during the search of the boy's home and took five children from the residence into protective custody, said authorities. The fourth teen, also a 17-year-old boy, of Agoura Hills, was charged with possession of a controlled substance, the sheriff's office said. He was released to his parents' custody, according to police. Police allege Griffen, Nemberg and a juvenile met at Sumac Park in Agoura Hills on October 29 and drove to a nearby cul-de-sac, where Griffen injected narcotics, causing him to instantly become ill and unconscious, authorities said. Nemberg allegedly dragged the unconscious Griffen into his car and then drove him around the area, police said. Nemberg called acquaintances and asked them if he could drive to their residences, but they told him no because their parents were home, police said. Nemberg allegedly took a still unconscious Griffen to Nemberg's home, authorities said. He didn't seek medical attention for Griffen until the next morning, when Nemberg woke up and saw Griffen was still unconscious, authorities alleged. ""He woke up the following morning and called 911 because Griffen was unresponsive,"" Sheriff's Sgt. Barry Hall said in a statement. Griffen was believed to have been dead for several hours before Nemberg made the call, according to the Los Angeles County coroner's office. Investigators believe Griffen had likely died from an overdose, but ""we're still waiting for a toxicology results to determine the ultimate cause of death,"" Hall said. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Griffen Kramer, 18, son of a retired NFL quarterback, dies of apparent overdose .

"London, England (CNN) -- They don't call it being ""sent to Siberia"" for nothing. We learned this on the first day of our trip to Novokuznetsk, in the western part of this 5.1 million square-mile region of Russia, while filming a documentary about how and why the youth of this economically depressed city were in the death grip of a heroin epidemic. It's a story squarely at odds with the rebranding of Russian youth as prosperous super humans living in a world of money, success and freedom. In reality, Russia now consumes 21 percent of the world's heroin. And with a southern border more than 4,000 miles long, an area greater than the distance from New York to London, it's little wonder that Moscow's attempts at interdiction have largely failed. A sense of Soviet-era poverty pervades in Novokuznetsk: the moldering grey housing blocks, the wake-up call of barking wild dogs, the 6 a.m. hotel breakfasts of Spam and hard-fried eggs speckled with dill. But we weren't here for fun. No one has much fun here. Before we set off on our trip, we heard whispers of a new drug called krokodil -- a synthetic opiate made by mixing petrol, codeine pills, and eye drops -- that earned its reptilian nickname by turning users' skin scaly, eating them from the inside, and rotting the brain and limbs, before precipitating a painful death. When researching the krokodil story, we heard grim tales of zombified addicts building DIY coffins to bury their friends, disfigured and brain-damaged ex-users, and religious cults disguised as rehab clinics. During a weeklong trip to Novokuznetsk, we found all of this -- and more.","Russian city of Novokuznetsk in 'death grip' of drug epidemic .

"(CNN) -- Dating advice books take a tech-addicted turn with the release of ""Flirtexting: How To Text Your Way To His Heart."" The authors of ""Flirtexting,"" above, say women need to learn how to text their way to love. The book's co-authors, Olivia Baniuszewicz and Debra Goldstein, seek to explain the dating scene based on the premise that men understand text messages while women need to catch up. ""It's official. Boys text, therefore girls must learn how to flirtext!"" they say on their Web site, flirtexting.com. Baniuszewicz and Goldstein offer up a new etiquette for what they call the ""A.C."" world of dating -- or ""after cells."" The pair, who described themselves as ""best friends"" and ""best flirtexters,"" spoke with CNN about their book, and the text message's role in society. The following is an edited version of that conversation. CNN: What abbreviations would you need to know in order to flirt over text messages? Debra: We say, ""If you don't wanna date, abbreviate."" Too many abbreviations is a turn off, so be very careful. If you don't have to abbreviate, then don't. For ""OK,"" you can write the letter ""k,"" and for ""are"" you can write the letter ""r,"" but never the ""great"" with the 8 in the middle [gr8]. Please never do that. Olivia: So, the things you should avoid when abbreviating is writing ""perf"" [short for ""perfect""] or ""brill"" [short for ""brilliant""] back to a guy. That's fun for girls texting to each other, but not when you're trying to flirtext. CNN: What's the difference? Why would a guy take it differently? Olivia: It's just a little girly. You just have to know your audience and speak to it, and that's all flirtexting is all about. CNN: Do you think the idea that you need to teach girls how to use text messages to pick up guys is a little sexist? Debra: Sexist? Oh absolutely not. I think it's about empowering women to have the time to come across exactly the way they want and in the best light.  Watch how to enter this new dating world » . Olivia: I think flirtexting is all about empowering. It's all about you choosing your moment. Girls can choose their moment. Girls can decide what they want to get out of this text in order to ask him out, or is it a date, or for him to just meet up with you that night just to have a good laugh, and banter back and forth because you're bored at work. This is all that it's about. CNN: Are there any people who date exclusively through texts? Debra: There's a lot of girls who will say, ""He keeps texting me but I want him to call"" ... I think there is a time when you need to put the cell down and pick up the phone if you really like someone. Olivia: There's a huge no-no: not to be heavy in your text messages. So a lot of times, I think things like ""I want to break up with you"" or ""I love you"" for the first time over text -- you should just not be doing that, and I think that's a mistake a lot of people do. CNN: What are some other things that shouldn't be discussed over text? Debra: We say, ""Don't kid yourself."" If he only texts you past 10 p.m. he's probably just looking to hook up. So girls, watch out for that. Olivia: True. And the other don't -- I think we've all been there -- is texting under the influence: TUI. [Laughs]. It's true. I think you're out with your girlfriends, you're having a drink, or it's a lonely Sunday evening and you just feel the urge to flirtext a guy. You're going to regret it the next morning. So find a sponsor, one of your friends that you call or text instead, to kind of wean you off of texting in that moment. CNN: What about dating using other mediums, like Facebook or Twitter? Olivia: Flirtweeting? ... Facebook has really taken that up to a different level and has opened our dating world in a sense to us. Because we could be like, ""Oh! Todd is friends with my friend Sara. Let me ask Sara about Todd before I respond back to his message or his friend request. I mean, it's beautiful! Debra: It is beautiful. Olivia: I'm gonna cry. CNN: Could you all give me some personal examples of ""dos and don'ts."" Either texts that you've sent that you've regretted or things that were sent to you that were really bad. Debra: Oh absolutely. In flirtexting there are the most important three dos. We call them ""The Three Ts."" The first is timing. Just because it's speedy technology doesn't mean you have to be speedy with your response. It's your moment, and we say, ""Text when you're ready."" And the second one is thought. You've got 160 characters to create a message that's sure to impress. So take your time, and be sure to make him laugh. And the third one is texting plan. If you're going to be flirtexting off the chain like we do then you're going to need an unlimited texting plan. And Virgin Mobile has a really good one right now, it's called the Texter's Delight. And it is delightful. Olivia: It is a delight. CNN: Do you all both use that company? Are you sponsored by that company? Debra: Both. We do, yeah, we use it. It's great, it's really easy. CNN: Do you use the cell phone to talk? Olivia: I do with my mom, who doesn't text [laughs]. But um, she's slowly learning and then maybe I can just get rid of that altogether. CNN: How has that experience been, trying to teach your mom how to text? What does she think of it? Olivia: It's been challenging at first, being that she came from an over-the-phone, old-school approach. She is coming to realize that it's really becoming a cultural phenomenon and it's something that she needs and wants to adapt to. And she's also single. She knows that she needs to pick up that phone if she wants to be flirtexting and going on dates. CNN: Are you working on anything after this? Debra: There's hopefully more books. I think guys are really interested to know what girls are thinking. We've taught girls how to text her way into his heart and now we think guys are really wanting to know how to get into our hearts. So there's a lot. Good stuff.","Co-authors of ""Flirtexting"" give advice on using text messages to get dates .

"(CNN) -- President Obama delivered the commencement address Friday to the U.S. Naval Academy's graduating class, speaking to an audience of 30,000 that included a former presidential candidate and proud parent of one of the graduates in attendance. Jack McCain shakes hands with President Obama at Friday's commencement ceremony. John Sidney McCain IV, more commonly known as Jack, on Friday became the fourth McCain to graduate from the Annapolis, Maryland, service academy and the fourth with the same name. ""America, look at these young men and women. Look at these sailors and Marines. Here are the values that we cherish. Here are the ideals that endure,"" Obama told the crowd. About midday at the academy's commissioning and graduation ceremony, McCain received a Bachelor of Science degree, taking the oath of office and being commissioned as an ensign in the U.S. Navy 103 years after his great-grandfather did the same.  Watch Obama hug John McCain's son » . With parents John and Cindy McCain watching, he shook hands with the president and then walked back into the crowd to applause and more hugs. Joe McCain told CNN that his brother plans to join his father and great-grandfather as naval aviators. ""His grandfather, JSM Jr., was in submarines, commanding three different boats in World War II,"" he said. That grandfather later became Adm. McCain and was commander of the Pacific Theater during the Vietnam War, when Jack's father, now Arizona Sen. John McCain, was being held as a prisoner of war in Hanoi. In an interview last year with GoMids.com, Jack McCain reflected on the advice his father gave him on the day he arrived at the Naval Academy. ""My dad told me there is one thing McCains are good at, and that is not giving in to pressure, and honor -- keeping our honor regardless of what happens,"" Jack McCain said. ""He then said, 'Don't lie, cheat or steal -- anything else is fair game.' "" John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee in 2008, frequently poked fun at his record at the Naval Academy while on the campaign trail, pointing out that he ""stood fifth from the bottom"" of his class and racked up dozens of demerits. At a campaign event last October, McCain joked that Jack needed a ""DNA check"" because he had yet to receive a single demerit. (Jack McCain told GoMids.com that he did accumulate some demerits -- for wearing flip-flops outside and forgetting to shave). McCain told Fox News on Thursday that his son is graduating ""in better class standing than I had, which wasn't hard to do."" ""I'm very proud of him,"" he said. Meghan McCain, Jack's older sister, sent a message on Twitter Friday saying her younger brother, Jimmy, could not attend because he is serving overseas. McCain told Fox News he is returning home this weekend. In his remarks to the students, Obama made a vow that he would not send them to war unless it is ""absolutely necessary."" ""It's a promise that as long as I am your commander in chief, I will only send you into harm's way when it is absolutely necessary, and with the strategy, the well-defined goals, the equipment and the support that you need to get the job done,"" he said. ""This includes the job of bringing the Iraq war to a responsible end and pursuing a new comprehensive strategy to disrupt, dismantle and defeat al Qaeda and its allies in Afghanistan and Pakistan."" Obama also promised additional assistance to military families, vowing that ""we will be with you every step of the way, increasing your pay, increasing child care and helping families deal with the stress and separation of war."" And he said new laws will help ensure that veterans are well taken care of. Obama's commencement address was his third and final of the year. He was also commencement speaker at Arizona State University and the University of Notre Dame.","Son of Sen. John McCain, the former GOP presidential candidate, graduates .

"(CNN) -- A class-action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of three immigrant women who were allegedly sexually assaulted while in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Texas, the American Civil Liberties Union said this week. The ACLU, citing documents it said it had obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, said in a news release that there have been nearly 200 allegations of sexual abuse of immigration detainees jailed at detention facilities across the United States since 2007. The ACLU release did not give dates of any of the alleged assaults, including those involving the three women who are plaintiffs in the class-action suit. The plaintiffs were identified only as Sarah Doe, Kimberly Doe and Raquel Doe ""to protect them from further harm,"" the ACLU said. The alleged attacks occurred while the plaintiffs were being transported from the T. Don Hutto Family Residential Center in Taylor, Texas, to the airport or bus station in nearby Austin, the ACLU said. Its release did not say where the class-action suit was filed Wednesday, but it said defendants include three ICE officials; Williamson County, Texas, where the Hutto facility is; the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), a private prison company that manages the Hutto facility; the former facility administrator for Hutto; and a guard at the facility. The lawsuit alleges that ICE along with Williamson County and the Corrections Corporation of America were ""deliberately indifferent and willfully blind to the fact that (the guard named as a defendant) and other employees regularly violated the rule that detainees are not be transported without another escort officer of the same gender present,"" the ACLU said. ICE did not comment specifically on the ACLU's announcement of the lawsuit, but an agency spokeswoman said ICE ""maintains a strict zero tolerance policy for any kind of abusive or inappropriate behavior and requires all contractors working with the agency to adhere to this policy."" ICE Public Affairs Officer Gillian Christensen added that the agency requires regular criminal backgrounds checks for its workforce. ""The (Department of Homeland Security) Office of the Inspector General and ICE's Office of Professional Responsibility investigate ALL allegations of sexual abuse or misconduct and the agency takes appropriate action -- whether it is pursuing criminal charges or administrative action -- when those allegations are substantiated,"" Christensen said in the ICE statement. The Corrections Corporation of America did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the ACLU announcement. The ACLU said it was basing its claim that there have been 185 allegations of sexual abuse in federal detention centers against female immigration detainees on various federal documents. The documents -- obtained from the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General, Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and ICE, according to the ACLU -- showed that Texas had more alleged abuse cases, 56, than any other state, the organization's news release said. ""While the information gleaned from the documents likely does not represent the full scope of the problem given that sexual abuse is notoriously underreported, the documents nonetheless make clear that the sexual abuse of immigration detainees is not an isolated problem limited to a few rogue facilities or to a handful of bad-apple government contractors who staff some of the nation's immigration jails,"" the ACLU said. ""Unfortunately, we believe these complaints are just the tip of the iceberg,"" said Mark Whitburn, senior staff attorney for the ACLU of Texas.","The ACLU says three immigrant women were sexually assaulted in ICE custody .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A Bush administration official has publicly described a detainee's treatment at the U.S. Navy Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as torture, according to a published report. The detention of terror suspects at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, has been a source of controversy. Susan Crawford, the retired judge in charge of determining which Guantanamo detainees should be tried by a U.S. military commision, has refused to refer the case of Mohammed al-Qahtani to prosecutors because of that assessment, The Washington Post reported Wednesday. ""We tortured (Mohammed al-) Qahtani,"" Crawford told the Post. ""His treatment met the legal definition of torture. And that's why I did not refer the case"" for prosecution. Military prosecutors have accused al-Qahtani of helping to plan the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, and believe he may have sought to participate, possibly as the ""20th hijacker."" The United States had been seeking the death penalty against al-Qahtani and five other men in connection with the 9/11 attacks. Crawford approved charges against the other five. She told the newspaper she came to her decision based on the combination of the interrogation techniques, their duration and the effect on al-Qahtani's health. ""The techniques they used were all authorized, but the manner in which they applied them was overly aggressive and too persistent,"" she said. ""You think of torture, you think of some horrendous physical act done to an individual. This was not any one particular act; this was just a combination of things that had a medical impact on him, that hurt his health. It was abusive and uncalled for. And coercive. Clearly coercive. It was that medical impact that pushed me over the edge"" to call it torture, she told the paper. When asked later  Wednesday about the report, White House Press Secretary Dana Perino responded, ""It has never been the policy of this president or this administration to torture. ""Because of command influence concerns, I have not commented about individual cases from this podium and ... that's as much as I can say about it."" Pressed further on the issue, Perino said, ""The commander-in-chief should not be commenting on cases where the government is bringing a case against a detainee. It would be inappropriate to do so from the White House."" The Department of Defense issued a statement Wednesday defending the military treatment of al-Qahtani. ""We have conducted more than a dozen investigations and reviews of our detention operations, including specifically the interrogation of al-Qahtani, the alleged 20th hijacker. ""The investigations concluded the interrogation methods used at Gitmo (Guantanamo), including the special interrogation techniques used with Qahtani in 2002, were lawful. ""However, subsequent to those reviews, the department adopted new and more restrictive policies, and improved oversight procedures for interrogation and detention operations. ""Some of the aggressive questioning techniques used on al-Qahtani, although permissible at the time, are no longer allowed in the updated Army field manual."" In November, military prosecutors said they would try to refile charges against al-Qahtani based on later interrogations that did not use harsh techniques, the paper reported. Crawford, who dismissed war crimes charges against al-Qahtani in May 2008, said she won't let the prosecutors pursue other charges. His interrogation took place over 50 days -- from November 2002 to January 2003, and he was held in isolation until April 2003, she said. ""For 160 days, his only contact was with the interrogators,"" she said. Crawford, who studied interrogation and other military records, said al-Qahtani was forced to stand naked in front of a female agent, threatened with a military dog named Zeus, ""forced to wear a woman's bra and had a thong placed on his head"" during questioning, and ""was told that his mother and sister were whores,"" the newspaper reported. Al-Qahtani, a Saudi national, was denied entry to the United States by an immigration officer in August 2001, and later was captured in Afghanistan. In January 2002 he was sent to Guantanamo, where he has remained in custody as an enemy combatant. The agency said it is now focused on ensuring the proper treatment of detainees.","Retired judge refuses to refer case to prosecutors because of torture assessment .

"(CNN) -- Libyans erupted in jubilation Thursday from the very first incomplete reports that ousted leader Moammar Gadhafi was dead. A ""cacophony of celebration"" could be heard in Tripoli as ships and cars blasted their horns and shots were fired into the air, said CNN's Dan Rivers. ""It is very, very loud -- a lot of excitement,"" Rivers said. ""It's a great moment,"" said Mahmoud Shammam, information minister for Libya's National Transitional Council. ""I've been waiting for this moment for decades, and I'm thanking God that I'm alive to see this moment."" Video footage showed a Tripoli street where people embraced and jumped in joy and crowds ran alongside vehicles. Other rejoicing people were hanging out of car windows and sunroofs and gathered in the beds of pickup trucks. The sound of cheering could be heard, along with a call to prayer. Outside a hotel, staff including chefs wearing their white hats gathered, dancing and waving Libyan flags. ""They're breathing a huge sigh of relief here,"" Rivers said. Many Libyans were concerned that a free Gadhafi might play a role in destabilizing Libya in the future, he said. In Sirte -- Gadhafi's hometown and the city where he was discovered -- video showed people gathering in celebration, some riding on the tops of cars waving Libyan flags and shooting guns in the air as horns honked. One man, dressed in fatigues and carrying a weapon, ran up and kissed a television camera. Others chanted, danced and waved their hands in the air, some flashing the ""peace"" sign. Many had suspected Gadhafi was hiding in Sirte after revolutionary forces took Tripoli in August. He had not been seen in public in months. A former regime loyalist who did not want to be identified said in an e-mail to CNN that Gadhafi's death was ""good for the Libyan people"" because both his supporters and opponents ""can see a valid point in his death that they can relate to, although for different reasons."" His supporters, he said, can find ""remedy for their belief that he was on the right side of history defending his country"" from NATO occupation. Gadhafi's death ""will end morally and practically the NATO involvement."" In addition, he said, ""his supporters see him as a martyr, and this gives them (a) sense (of) pride, which provides a psychological remedy"" for many of them. His opponents can find justification for their belief that they fought ""a liberation battle for a better future, better democratic society, better Libya generally."" Gadhafi's death will bring them ""the heights of their sense of satisfaction for what they did,"" he wrote. If Gadhafi had been captured alive, this former regime loyalist wrote, it would have ""intensified (supporter's) effort to destabilize society further, for the hope that either they might be able to liberate him, or get one of his sons to power."" That, he said, ""would bring more destruction and devastation to society in general at all levels; including the death of many people."" If the ousted leader had been put on trial, the former loyalist added, it ""would have open(ed) many doors of disagreement that might lead to fight(ing), if not mass civil war."" Social media sites such as Twitter showed users expressing support for the Libyans and noting that Gadhafi's death would be another victory in a year that has seen the ouster of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and former Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, as well as the death of Osama bin Laden. Those from countries that participated in the so-called Arab Spring issued messages of support for Libyans. CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom contributed to this report.","Celebrations erupt in the Libyan cites of Tripoli and Sirte .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao on Tuesday blamed supporters of the Dalai Lama for recent violence in Tibet, and said Chinese forces exercised restraint in confronting unrest there. ""There is ample fact and we also have plenty of evidence proving that this incident was organized, premeditated, masterminded and incited by the Dalai clique,"" Wen said in a televised news conference. The Chinese premier also dismissed the Dalai Lama's claim that China is causing ""cultural genocide"" of his people in Tibet as lies. The United States has urged Chinese restraint after days of violent protests in Tibet, even as a deadline passed for anti-Chinese protesters to surrender. Death tolls from the violence vary. Exiled Tibetan independence campaigners say at least 80 people died while Chinese authorities put the figure lower. ""There are 13 common people who died in the beating, burning and smashing in the riots,"" said Champa Phuntsok, the head of Tibet's regional government. ""They died of fire, asphyxiation and beating. Some of them were set on fire by rioters and died in the burning."" U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Tom Casey said the United States is very concerned about the Chinese crackdown on Tibetan protesters. ""We continue to urge restraint on the part of the Chinese government in terms of how it responds to these protesters."" U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, according to wire service reports from Moscow, said: ""We have really urged the Chinese over several years to find a way to talk with the Dalai Lama, who is a figure of authority, who is not a separatist, and to find a way to engage him and bring his moral weight to a more sustainable and better solution of the Tibet issue."" In a news conference in Beijing on Monday, Champa Phuntsok blamed the violence on ""a small group of separatists and criminals"" who take their lead from exiled followers of Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. On Sunday, the exiled Dalai Lama condemned China's action in his homeland, accusing Beijing of ""cultural genocide."" Shops, schools and businesses were open Monday in Tibet's capital, Lhasa, but tensions remained high throughout the territory and three neighboring provinces after days of deadly clashes. Xinhua reported Monday that 160 locations in Lhasa were burned by rioters, including ""banks, a press establishment, shops, schools and hospitals.""  Watch Chinese police on the streets » . The state-run news agency quoted police in Tibet giving protesters a deadline of midnight Monday ""to stop their criminal activities and offering leniency to those who surrender themselves. ""Those who surrender and provide information on other lawbreakers will be exempt from punishment,"" Xinhua quoted a police notice as saying. James Miles, a reporter for The Economist who arrived in Lhasa just before the violence began last week and has been allowed to stay, told CNN Monday that Lhasa was now quiet but damage was evident throughout the city. The number of people killed Friday -- and which side they were on -- remained in dispute, but Miles said it appeared the dead included Tibetans as well as Han Chinese who operated businesses there. Chinese security forces maintained a strong presence, checking identification papers of people on the streets, Miles said. Phuntsok said the protesters wanted to destabilize Tibet ""at the critical and sensitive time that we are preparing for the Olympics."" ""There are 13 common people who died in the beating, burning and smashing in the riots,"" said Phuntsok. ""They died of fire, asphyxiation and beating. Some of them were set on fire by rioters and died in the burning."" He said Chinese police did not fire their guns or use anti-personnel weapons against the Tibetans despite 61 police officers being injured, six seriously. Watch riot police search homes » . Tibetan exiles described a much more violent response by police. A Xinhua story published Monday said the protesters had ""indisputable links to peace-preaching Dalai Lama."" Tibet is officially an autonomous region of China, but the Dalai Lama said that Tibetans are treated by the Chinese as second-class citizens in their own land. He said they need full autonomy to protect their cultural heritage. Since Tibet fell under Communist Chinese control in the 1950s, Han Chinese have moved into the province to participate in the government and operate businesses. Miles reported seeing incidents Friday of Tibetan crowds attacking Han Chinese residents with stones. He said many of the businesses burned by protesters belonged to Han Chinese. Violent protests were reported at or near Tibetan monasteries outside of Lhasa and in three other nearby Chinese provinces on Friday and in the days since.  Watch the generational divide among independence activists » . Tibetan monks at the Labrang Monastery in Xiahe, Gansu province -- 750 miles from Lhasa -- apparently staged a protest Friday and Saturday that Chinese security forces acted quickly to stop. Spence Palermo, a American who was filming a documentary at the monastery, said Chinese officials banned his crew from returning to the monastery Friday. They were suddenly rushed from their hotel Saturday as a ""seemingly endless convoy"" of Chinese troops headed toward the monastery, he said. Newsweek magazine reported Monday that as many as 4,000 monks and lay persons clashed with police near the monastery Friday and Saturday. Tibet Watch, a group based in Dharamsala, India, told CNN that 34 people have died in the Nwaga County area of Sichuan province in western China. The dead include women and children, the group said in an e-mail, adding they were killed by Chinese police attempting to stop the protests. Eight bodies -- including the bodies of two monks -- were brought to the Nagaba Kirti monastery, the Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy in Dharamsala told CNN. Tibet Watch said another protest took place in Machu County in northwestern China Sunday. It was started by some Tibetan students distributing fliers. They were later joined by monks and laypeople. During the demonstration, several shops and a security headquarters were burned, the group said. An estimated 2,000 Tibetans were using firecrackers in the streets, the group said. Chinese authorities have denied CNN permission to enter Tibet to report on the current situation. E-mail to a friend .","NEW: Chinese Premier says China's response to the protests was restrained .

"New York (CNN) -- Two Pakistani Muslims in Brooklyn are now running the oldest bialy store in the city, and keeping it kosher. Zafaryab Ali and his business partner, Peerada Shah, were shocked on hearing through a friend that Coney Island Bialys and Bagels was closing. Ali had worked at the store for 10 years in the 1990s and remembers it always being crowded, with lines out the door and people waiting up to half an hour for fresh bialys. So Ali and Shah bought the store to keep the 91-year business alive. Bialys are a lighter, softer cousin to the bagel, traditionally made with onion sprinkled on top. ""I know bagels and my partner knows management,"" Ali said. ""If we work hard and pay attention, we'll build up and bring more customers in."" Ali and Shah are keeping everything the same -- ingredients, equipment, recipes -- all used when it was a kosher store under Jewish management. Ali is now on the hunt for a rabbi to come and give the store an official kosher certification. They even have some of the same staff, like Ernie Devivo, a semi-retired baker who is still helping out around the shop. ""I'm glad we opened up again,"" Devivo said. ""It's good for everybody."" Asked about seeing the store open again, after a short closure, one customer said, ""It's good. It's beautiful."" According to the bakery's website, Coney Island Bialys Bakers Co. was started in 1920 by Morris Rosenzweig, who brought the bialy recipe with him from Poland. The family continued to make hand-rolled, traditional bialys for 91 years. The business passed to Rosenzweig's son Don and then to his son, Steve Ross, who began wholesaling the bialys as well, shipping them across the country. Then in August, Steve Ross decided to close. ""My son was going to take over, but with the area changing and business slowing down and the economy doing a double take on the recession, it wasn't worth keeping at that point,"" Ross said. Ali and Shah reopened shop In mid-September, and say that business has been going well. Ross is glad to see his family's store living on. ""I've got no problem whether they're black, white, purple, green, yellow. They came in, wanted to keep the business open and wanted to keep the industry going. ... I'm glad it's still there. I'm happy."" And Coney Island Bialys and Bagels is still a family business, with Ali, his brother and his nephew all working to keep its traditions alive. ""We're sticking with kosher,"" Ali said.","Two Pakistani Muslims keep a kosher bakery open .

"(CNN) -- It's possible no more exotic animals are on the loose after deputies killed 49 lions, tigers and other wild animals freed from a local farm by its suicidal owner, an Ohio sheriff told reporters Thursday. Of the 56 animals released Tuesday night, only a grizzly bear, two monkeys and three leopards were taken alive, Muskingum County Sheriff Matt Lutz said. Killed were two wolves; six black bears; two grizzly bears; nine male lions; eight lionesses; one baboon; three mountain lions; and 18 Bengal tigers, Lutz said Thursday. Six animals were taken to the Columbus Zoo. Lutz said he has been in contact with Jack Hanna, the zoo's director emeritus, and ""the animals are doing well. They are eating, they are active and they are being evaluated."" One monkey remained unaccounted for Wednesday night, Hanna said. Lutz said Thursday there was one monkey unaccounted for, and acknowledged it could be on the loose, but said there had been no reported sightings and it was believed one of the big cats may have eaten it. It was thought to be in the same area as another monkey which was killed by the cats, he said. There is a concern the monkey could be carrying herpes B, Lutz said. He urged members of the public not to approach a monkey if they see it but to summon authorities. The farm's owner, Terry Thompson, pried open cages and opened the farm's fences before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound Tuesday afternoon, Lutz said. Autopsy results confirmed the shot was self-inflicted, the sheriff said. Thompson also had a bite wound to his head consistent with a bite from a ""larger-type cat,"" Lutz said. The bite is believed to have occurred ""within seconds to a minute"" after the gunshot wound, he said. Thompson was known to feed the animals chicken parts, Lutz said, and a pile of such items was found in the home's driveway. The only animals left on the property as of Thursday were horses, the sheriff said. The killed animals were buried on Thompson's property, at the request of his wife. The animals, he said, ""were like kids to her."" Lutz said he does not know who leaked a photo of the dead animals, but told reporters he hopes to serve multiple terms and ""I have a few years to find out."" He said one person attempted to steal an animal's body. None of his deputies are equipped with tranquilizer guns, Lutz told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" And with night falling Tuesday as authorities arrived, he gave the order to kill the escaped animals. Ohio animal owner supplied cub for Heidi Klum . ""If this had been a 9 o'clock or 10 o'clock incident, in the middle of the day, odds are high that we may have been able to surround the area and keep everything contained,"" he said. ""But our biggest problem that we had was nightfall. We had about an hour, hour and a half of light, and we just couldn't take the chance."" ""These were 300-pound animals and they were very dangerous,"" Lutz said Thursday. Hanna, the zoo's director emeritus, said he was upset by loss of ""precious"" animals, but defended the decision to use deadly force. ""To have no one hurt or killed here with 40-something animals getting loose is unbelievable,"" he told CNN's ""The Situation Room."" Hanna led a team of experts who arrived with four tranquilizer guns late Tuesday in an effort to corral the animals. He said the drugs take several minutes to subdue an animal even with a good shot, and one tiger had to be killed Wednesday afternoon when it turned on a veterinarian after being hit with a tranquilizer dart. The Humane Society of the United States also said Wednesday it does not fault authorities for using deadly force in such a situation. Both the Humane Society and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals urged Ohio officials to put a law in place barring the keeping of exotic animals as pets. Lutz said Ohio Gov. John Kasich had called him and expressed his support, and acknowledged that the law needs to be changed. ""I'll do anything I have to do"" to ensure such an incident never again occurs, Lutz said. Overnight Tuesday and early Wednesday, sheriff's deputies searched the eastern Ohio woods around the city of Zanesville with night-vision gear and patrolled in pickups, armed with shotguns. Flashing signs on the highways in eastern Ohio warned motorists Wednesday: ""Caution. Exotic animals."" Schools were closed, and some frightened residents said they were keeping to their homes as sheriff's deputies hunted the lions, tigers, leopards and grizzly bears. ""Yeah, there's a lion on Mount Perry Road. ... I just drove by and it walked out in front of me and was standing there under the street light,"" one caller to 911 told deputies. Opinion: Wild animals should be left in the wild . Thompson's property is about 2 miles outside Zanesville. The 62-year-old had been released from a federal prison September 30 after pleading guilty earlier this year to possessing illegal firearms, including five fully automatic firearms. A civil case seeking forfeiture of firearms was pending, according to the U.S. attorney's office in Ohio's Southern District. He also had been convicted of animal cruelty and was arrested several times for traffic violations. Lutz told reporters Thursday he could not speculate on what prompted Thompson to take his life. Sam Kopchak, Thompson's neighbor, said he saw lions and bears running free Tuesday evening, with one tiger chasing horses. Kopchak managed to get himself and his horse into his barn and telephoned his mother. ""It was like a war zone,"" Kopchak said when authorities descended on the property, set off the road named after Kopchak's family. Kopchak described Thompson as aloof. He loved animals. Kopchak saw him driving one time with a baby black bear on his chest . CNN's Moni Basu, Jordana Ossad, Andy Rose, Jason Carroll, Ninette Sosa, Ed Payne and Maggie Schneider contributed to this report.","NEW: Autopsy results confirm man shot himself after freeing animals .

"(PEOPLE.com) -- It's been more than two months since their beloved 13-year-old dog Darla passed away from cancer, but Brooke Shields and her family are still reeling from the loss. ""It's very sad, actually,"" she tells PEOPLE. ""We're all in that sort of trauma where we have her ashes and the girls (Rowan, 8, and Grier, 5) carry these little footprints of hers around. She was the only dog we've really ever had."" The American bulldog was given to Shields as a puppy, and was a member of the family, taking a central role in many memories over the years. ""She knew I was pregnant before I even knew I was pregnant,"" Shields says. ""She would circle me and not let me walk anywhere, I was going, 'God, what are you doing, get out from under my feet!' And that afternoon I found out."" The void that Darla has left is immense, and it won't be filled with a new pet anytime soon. ""We walk to school everyday and they see all these different dogs, we're kind of [thinking about] what way do we want to go,"" she says. ""We'll probably never get another bulldog. We would just constantly be going, 'That's not Darla.'"" For now, Shields and her family are content on seeing animals from afar -- like Mom's new furry costar: a horse called Odd Job Bob who stars opposite Shields in the new tween flick The Greening of Whitney Brown. In the comedy, Shields plays the mother of a snooty private school teen (played by Sammi Hanratty) who is forced to move to the country where she reluctantly befriends the gypsy vanner horse. ""He's smart and sweet,"" Shields says of the star stallion who performs all kinds of tricks for the film. ""He understands. There's something about him that is human."" A horse lover all of her life, Shields never got to ride Bob because trainers wanted Hanratty to bond completely with the animal, but she did slip him a treat or two on set. ""He wasn't demanding at all,"" she jokes. ""He loved [eating] all the carrots and jam."" Watching the sweet family movie with her daughters will definitely be a bright spot in what's been a difficult few months. ""They're going to love it,"" she says.

"(CNN) -- College football is in a real institutional identity crisis. The range of reactions to the Penn State scandal, from Penn State University itself to the NCAA to the American people, tells us that we don't know what college football is or what it should be. Penn State University is confused. Mostly, it has reacted strongly and rightly, but it has not cleaned house. Joe Paterno, Graham Spanier and others are gone, but should Mike McQueary stay, and were there others on the Penn State coaching staff who were aware of Jerry Sandusky's alleged actions? And many other questions remain: Why weren't police immediately involved? How did this stay covered up for so long? The NCAA's response has been little better. NCAA President Mark Emmert released a statement last week, saying, ""The NCAA will defer in the immediate term to law enforcement officials since this situation involved alleged crimes. ... To be clear, civil and criminal law will always take precedence over Association rules."" While perhaps technically correct, the victims, as well as the college football community, deserve more of a response than this. The American people are outraged, and rightfully so. It looks like the work of a monster (who still says he is not guilty) destroyed the lives of innocent children. He has forever tarnished the reputation of former and future Penn State students, athletes and coaches. This is the worst scandal in the history of college football. For it not to receive the worst punishment would be unjust. The college football ""death penalty"" (the NCAA's punishment that bans a school from participating in a sport for at least a year) has been given to only one football program, ever: Southern Methodist University in the 1987-88 season for numerous NCAA violations involving paying athletes under the table. SMU's actions pale in comparison with what occurred at Penn State. But under NCAA rules, the criminal actions of a few men are not necessarily NCAA rules violations. The NCAA decides where criminal laws overlap with its rules. And so, from a legal standpoint, it's possible that the Penn State football program will escape with less of a punishment than SMU. How the NCAA answers these questions may affect the future of college football. As is the case with so many recent college sports scandals, the events at Penn State call into question the effects of big money on the inside workings of college sports. Penn State football is a business -- an enormously profitable one, raking in more than $70 million a year. Joe Paterno's salary alone was about $1 million annually. Penn State profits immensely from the success of its football program on the backs of unpaid amateur athletes. In many of these scandals, the players, often innocent and unprotected, are hurt the most, while the insulated, tight-lipped higher-ups of college boards and athletic programs fall back on their salaries and pensions. I say this as a longtime fan and admirer of college football, not an opportunistic critic. There are many big-money programs that are scandal free, like the University of Texas, the largest college football revenue generator in the country. Many big programs can navigate ethically because of their moral compasses. Similarly, many coaches and players never have ethical issues, and they should be applauded. But I'm concerned about where the sport is headed. If college football is truly the amateur athletics wing of educational institutions, then these multimillion-dollar programs should be transparent and accountable. A student's athletic performance should be tied to his academic achievement; tighter age and eligibility restrictions should be implemented. In another fitting example, Yale quarterback Patrick Witt recently chose to play this Saturday in the Harvard-Yale game rather than attend his Rhodes scholarship interview, which happens to fall on the same day. Witt is free to choose of his liking, but he will forfeit the chance to win a Rhodes scholarship this year. The NCAA has remained silent about this, a clear opportunity to support or help a real student-athlete. Or college football can go the other way. If the NCAA manages college football like a professional, for-profit enterprise, the players should be treated likewise. While revenues to college football have skyrocketed, benefits to players have not. Players can't work jobs outside of football, but their school can sell their jersey for profits that they never see. Should these players accept gifts or contributions, the penalties can be more severe than what the NCAA could level on Penn State. Perhaps it's time for an open and honest debate about giving stipends, living expenses and even salaries to college football players. Incentives could be in place that encourage players to follow NCAA guidelines while rewarding them for their performance. The NCAA's shortcomings are not to blame for the alleged actions of Jerry Sandusky. However, the NCAA system sometimes fosters closed-door, insulated, big-money administrations whose best interest is at times to sweep scandals under the rug and protect its own. It's time for change. College football should decide what it really is. Is it an amateur undertaking, subordinate to and supportive of education? Or is it a farm system for the professional leagues? Maybe it's time it made up its mind. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William J. Bennett.","William Bennett: The NCAA is adopting a low profile in Penn State scandal .

"(CNN) -- A freak fall snow storm slammed the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast on Saturday, leaving three people dead, more than 2 million households without power and thousands of air travelers stranded. An 84-year-old man was napping in a recliner at his home in Temple, Pennsylvania, on Saturday afternoon when part of a large, snow-filled tree fell into his house and killed him ""instantly,"" according to a state police report. With numerous downed trees in the area, rescue crews took two hours to ""safely remove the victim."" Another person died while driving in Hebron, Connecticut, state emergency spokesman Scott Devico said. A third person was killed in Springfield, Massachusetts, when a man in his 20s ignored police barricades surrounding downed power lines and touched a metal guard rail, which was charged, said city fire department spokesman Dennis Legere. Predicting the system could dump as much as 18 inches of snow in some spots, Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy joined New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick in issuing emergency declarations for their respective states. ""It's like a blizzard, you can't see far at all,"" CNN iReporter Alban Ajro, 32, said Saturday night from Watertown, Connecticut. ""This is the first time that I can ever recall this kind of storm happening before Halloween."" All domestic flights out of New Jersey's Newark International Airport were canceled around 4 p.m. Saturday, according to an announcement made at the airport. Frustrated passengers filled an array of long lines, trying to change their tickets in light of the storm. Overheard: Storm sparks discussion about new grid . Another airport in the Garden State, Teterboro, closed just after 2 p.m. before reopening hours later, the Federal Aviation Administration reported on its website. The FAA also reported major delays of, at times, over 5 hours at New York's two airports, John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia. Richard Roth, a CNN correspondent, was among those affected when his Syracuse-to-Kennedy flight was diverted to Hartford because of the storm. He sat with his fellow passengers on the runway at Bradley International Airport for about four and a half hours, and -- roughly eight hours after arriving -- he was still stuck in the terminal. ""We're here in the dark now,"" Roth said Saturday evening. ""There's no hope, at the moment, in sight."" The Connecticut governor acknowledged that conditions ""are not very pleasant"" at Bradley, where 23 flights have been diverted. He added, ""They're trying to get people off their planes as rapidly as they can."" The early season snowstorm was the result of unseasonably cold air mixing with a storm system on the East Coast. iReport: Winter weather near you . As of 8 p.m., the storm had already dumped 10 inches of snow in places as far afield as Ridgefield, Connecticut; Ogletown, Pennsylvania; and Terra Alta, West Virginia, according to the National Weather Service. Parts of New York and New Jersey especially got buried, including 15.5 inches in West Milford, New Jersey, and 12 inches in Harriman, New York. Lesser, albeit still significant amounts were measured in other locales around the northeast, including 1.3 inches of snow in New York's Central Park as of 8 p.m. -- the most ever for this date since record-keeping began in 1869. Snow continued to fall Saturday night as the system moved over New England. The storm's timing made it unique and caught some off-guard. ""We're used to a lot of snow here, but not this early,"" CNN iReporter Michael Majosky, 34, said from Windber, Pennsylvania. ""We don't mind the snow -- it's pretty neat having it around Halloween."" Winter storm warnings were in effect Saturday evening for a swath of states, from Pennsylvania to eastern Maine. Along with heavy snow, high winds gusting up to 50 mph were possible. Forecasters' predictions of power outages and downed trees in some areas bore fruit, as hundreds of thousands were without electricity as of Saturday afternoon. The reason is that the moisture content -- thus density -- of the falling snow was particularly high given temperatures hovering around the freezing point. 'Occupy' demonstrators face bite of wintry storm . Malloy, the Connecticut governor, said early Saturday night that 50,000 to 70,000 customers were losing power every hour, with the leading utility Connecticut Light and Power reporting on its website about 550,000 without service at 9 p.m. Saturday. The governor cautioned that power crews are not out on the roads, and won't return until road conditions improve markedly. ""If you are without power, you should expect to be without power for a prolonged period of time,"" Malloy said. About 715,000 customers were without power late Saturday in New Jersey, in addition to 333,000 in neighboring New York, according to figures reported Saturday evening by power companies in those states. Another 360,000 didn't have electricity in Pennsylvania due to the storm. Other states were affected as well, including at least 7,000 households in Maryland, 6,300 in Virginia who get service from Dominion, and 1,400 Allegheny Power customers in West Virginia. The storm had wreaked havoc on the roads, with Malloy noting ""a large number of spin-outs and vehicles going off the road"" in his state. He noted that -- in addition to the fatality -- a state trooper was injured in a crash. And in Pennsylvania and elsewhere, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers warned that the wet snow would turn to ice in many spots overnight due to freezing temperatures, making road conditions even more perilous. One positive is that the wintry weather shouldn't last too much longer. By Sunday afternoon, the storm is expected to have passed the United States. Temperatures should warm by then -- including a high of 49 forecast for Sunday in New York, warming into the high-50s over the course of the week. CNN's Greg Botelho, Greg Morrison, Sara Weisfeldt, Elizabeth Cherneff and Sean Morris contributed to this report.","NEW: The number of those without power in New Jersey and New York rises .

"(CNN) -- Gabrielle Giffords, the Arizona congresswoman who was shot in the head during a shooting rampage in January, appeared in her first television interview late Monday night, clearly understanding the questions put to her but able to respond only in simple words. ""I cried,"" she told ABC's Diane Sawyer in response to a question about how she felt when her husband told her what had happened. ""Died,"" she said. ""Sad,"" said her husband, retired astronaut Mark Kelly. ""Sad,"" Giffords agreed. ""I cried. A lot of people died."" She said she has no memory of the incident. ""That day is gone?"" Sawyer asked. ""Gone,"" Giffords replied. Giffords also doesn't remember the next 13 days at a hospital in Tucson before she was flown to Houston. She said she remembers the flight ""a little bit."" ""She said she felt like a --"" Kelly said. ""A zombie,"" Giffords said, finishing the sentence. Giffords also said she never got angry about what happened. ""No,"" she said. ""No. No. No."" She paused. ""Life,"" she said, then shrugged. ""Life."" Jared Loughner, 23, is accused of wounding Giffords and 12 others and killing six people in the shooting at a meet-and-greet event for the congresswoman outside a Tucson, Arizona, shopping center. Giffords, a Democrat, posted an audio message to her constituents Tuesday on her Facebook page, saying she missed them and Tuscon: ""The mountains, the blue skies, even the heat. ""I'm getting stronger, I'm getting better,"" she says, adding that she wants to go back to work. She sat with her husband on a couch for the ABC interview, wearing a lime green jacket. She wore her hair short and smiled often. When Sawyer asked Giffords how she feels, the congresswoman responded, ""Pretty good."" Sawyer asked Giffords if it was painful to move her right arm. Giffords said it was not. ""Difficult,"" she said twice, then grinned and swung her left arm. ""Strong!"" she said, getting a laugh from Sawyer. ""Strong, strong!"" Giffords was shot in the head, with the bullet passing through the left side of her brain, which controls the right half of the body. Her right arm lay unused on her lap during the interview. But before the interview began, she leaned over to fix Sawyer's hair with her left hand. Giffords has made what doctors call a miraculous recovery since the shooting. Her neurosurgeon, Dr. Dong Kim, told CNN Tuesday that Giffords' thought process is normal -- a remarkable feat for someone with the kind of injuries she suffered. As a sign of her stunning recovery, Kim told CNN's Elizabeth Cohen that Giffords recently spoke two sentences in a row to him. ""Wow, you have a suit on today,"" she said to him when he walked in to see her. Then she added, ""What's with the necktie?"" The ABC report showed Giffords in therapy, struggling to come up with a word when asked what she would use to tell time. ""W....,"" the therapist prompts. ""Wwwwwwatch!"" Giffords says, to the delight of the therapist. She and Kelly told Sawyer she did two hours of therapy a day in their home. Giffords has clearly retained a sense of humor; her husband teases her when Sawyer asks what she loves by interjecting: ""Football! Gabby loves the NFL."" ""No, no, no,"" she giggles. ""Stinks!"" Loughner is in mental health treatment and will be re-evaluated early next year to determine his competency to stand trial.","NEW: Giffords doesn't remember the shooting, she says .

"(CNN) -- As I've written on various top 10 lists (and mentioned to anyone who will listen) Asghar Farhadi's ""A Separation"" is an exceptional film. It has been picking up awards since winning the Golden Bear at its world premiere at the 2011 Berlin International Film Festival and is one of the front-runners for best foreign language film at the upcoming Academy Awards. Nader (Peyman Moadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami) are a married couple in trouble. Simin wants to leave Iran with her husband and daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi), but Nader refuses to leave his ailing father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi). As a result, Simin sues Nader for divorce. But unless Nader either agrees to a divorce or permits Simin and Termeh to go without one, Simin cannot leave the country with her daughter. Nader refuses to give his permission and Simin moves out, choosing to live with her parents while continuing to try and get her husband to agree to either come with them or allow Termeh to go. However, it's not clear that their daughter even wants to leave and she chooses to stay with her father when Simin leaves. ""A Separation"" is a family drama, a mystery and an exploration of modern Iranian society. It's a deeply political film that hides its politics in every day occurrences. It's also a story that on some levels could be played out in any society and yet it reads as a very Iranian tale. This is a society about which Americans know very little yet one that is, on the surface, easy to relate to. Nader and Simin appear to be relatively secular. They are a modern, well-to-do, intellectual and cosmopolitan couple. So when Nader hires Razieh, a deeply religious, working class woman to care for his father who has advanced Alzheimer's, it sets in motion a rather unexpected whodunit of sorts. Razieh is repeatedly presented with dilemmas that challenge her faith and require her to call her spiritual adviser for guidance. For example, while her religion forbids her to touch a man who is not her husband, she is caring for an elderly and sick man. Surely she is allowed a dispensation for charitable or compassionate works? While her Imam assures her that this is indeed acceptable, the situation proves too much for Razieh who suggests to Nader that her unemployed husband Hodjat (Shahib Hosseini) might be a better fit. Unfortunately, Hodjat is arrested for being in debt before he can start work and Razieh must return. From day one she seems, for lack of a better word, squirrely. She's obviously hiding something from Nader and when he returns to the apartment one day to find his father non-responsive, on the floor and tied to the bed, he loses his temper and things go pear shaped. Here's where the mystery kicks in and things get complicated, but to reveal any more would deprive you of watching this film unfold. While the relationship between Nader and Simit is still front and center, so too is the story behind what happened to Nader's father and the aftermath. Who is lying and why? Who did what to whom? The answers to those questions lie in explorations of Iran's social, religious and political customs and serve to deepen the emotions that run through this film. I feel like a broken record, heaping praise on ""A Separation,"" but I really can't find anything wrong with it. My natural instinct is to try and bring some sort of balance to a review. Find a crack in the armor of a great film or some small bit of light in a dreadful one, but there is really nothing to criticize here and I get the feeling that upon a second viewing, it may rise even higher in my various top 10 lists. Moadi, Hatami and Bayat are all deeply convincing and moving actors. A true strength of an actor's performance is when the viewer doesn't understand a word of dialog and is still moved. Farhadi's direction and screenplay (the final 10 minutes of the film is among the best endings I've ever seen) combined with the brilliant work done by the performers, make this one of the truly great films of this year or any other. A Separation is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It contains some family dynamics of an emotional nature.","""A Separation"" is one of the front-runners for best foreign language film .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Members of the military may get expedited treatment at airport security checkpoints under a law signed Tuesday by President Obama. The law, authored by Rep. Chip Cravaack, R-Minnesota, requires the Transportation Security Administration to study ways to speed up screening of service members and, to the extent possible, their families, when the service members are in uniform and traveling on orders. Cravaack, a 24-year Navy veteran and former Northwest Airlines pilot, was inspired to introduce the bill after witnessing a soldier remove his boots while going through security at the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport. ""It seemed way too excessive for someone who was obviously a patriot serving his country,"" said the congressman's spokesman, Michael Bars. The new law was signed just days after two incidents involving the same soldier at airports in North Carolina and Texas. According to court records, Trey Scott Atwater, a 30-year-old Army Green Beret, had a military smoke grenade in his bag when he was leaving Fayetteville, North Carolina, on Christmas Eve headed for Texas. He was allowed to continue on his trip. On Saturday, he was arrested at Midland International Airport in Texas on his return trip when TSA screeners found an undisclosed amount of C-4 explosives in his bag. Authorities said Atwater did not have a detonator and initiator, that it would not have been possible to detonate the explosives, and that it did not appear he was up to anything nefarious. It was not immediately clear how any checkpoint changes would impact cases like Atwater's. Bars said the new law is intended to expedite screening, but not reduce security. Currently, the TSA expedites screening for trusted travelers by dedicating a special line for them, and by allowing them to keep their shoes on and keep laptops in their carry-on bags. The new law says the TSA should establish guidelines for screening travelers in military uniforms and combat boots, and consider incorporating military personnel into trusted traveler programs that give preference to passengers who undergo pre-screening. Nothing in the law prohibits additional screening of the service member if intelligence or law enforcement information indicates that additional screening is necessary. In November, TSA Administrator John Pistole told CNN that he was already working on ways to expedite screening for service members. The TSA was starting to tests its ability to scan military ID cards, known as ""Common Access Cards,"" at a regional airport in Monterey, CA. Pistole said the TSA test would not immediately result in quicker screening for service members. But if tests are successful, ""we hope to expand that to airports that would have a large number of military personnel traveling through them,"" he said. Supporters of the initiative said that by expediting the screening of military personnel, the TSA will have more time to focus on unknown travelers who could present a higher risk.""","A new law requires the TSA to study ways of speeding screening of military personnel .

"Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN) -- Tomas Escobar created a website in his bedroom in rural northwestern Argentina hoping to help people locate free movies online in a more efficient manner. From that small start in September 2009, EscobarÂ´s site, Cuevana.tv, has grown to one of the most popular entertainment sites in Latin America, attracting 15 million unique monthly users, according to Escobar. ""It was a hobby, a small thing. And it exploded in my hands,"" Escobar tells CNN. But it has also attracted the attention of international media companies armed with lawsuits. The success has transformed the unassuming and unkempt 22-year-old college dropout into something of a cult hero in the Spanish-speaking world. It took weeks of negotiations to get Escobar to agree to an interview with CNN, his first-ever with an international TV news organization. ""Cuevana has a lot of complications now that weren't thought of in the beginning, like servers and traffic. We are now trying to solve them in steps,"" Escobar says. Visitors to Cuevana can access thousands of titles -- the majority of them big-budget Hollywood productions with Spanish subtitles -- entirely for free. According to Escobar, Cuevana doesn't host the titles itself -- it simply serves as a content clearinghouse. ""It's the same concept as Google. You have a lot of links and indexes, and the user searches for these, and you give them the links,"" he says. ""So really, the legal compromise is on the other sites, not on Cuevana,"" Escobar says. But many companies and artists disagree. In November, HBO Latin America and Turner International Argentina - both, like CNN, part of Time Warner - took legal action against Cuevana in Argentina. HBO declined to provide CNN with details of its lawsuit against Cuevana, which alleged infringement of HBO's intellectual property rights. Turner Argentina asked a judge to block Cuevana from providing access to three of its original series, including the Steven Spielberg-produced ""Falling Skies."" The three shows are no longer on the site. ""It is one of the first judicial decisions in Argentina and Latin America, so we are proud to defend the intellectual property laws, we are proud to defend our own productions, and we are proud to defend the assets of our company,"" says Victor Roldan, director of legal affairs for Turner International Argentina. But it is not only deep-pocketed international studios taking Cuevana to task for providing free content without compensation. Local Latin American producers say they are feeling the pinch too. ""The problem is that all regulations were skipped, and all the control was given directly to the Cuevana users. This is damaging to producers, directors, and the entire film industry here,"" says Cristina AgÃ¼ero, president of the Argentina Association of Film Producers. Yet, Cuevana is still going strong and gaining more users every day. Escobar says many filmmakers are anxious to have their work available on the site, as it exposes them to a much-wider audience. ""They end up making more, not less, money,"" Escobar says. For millions of Cuevana users, the choice between watching a movie for free in the safety of their own home and leaving the house to spend money on a DVD rental is an easy one. ""I am not in favor of piracy, but I think sites like Cuevana should exist where you can access free movies. But the sites should pay the producers with money they get from advertisements,"" says . Federico Troilo, 38, a Cuevana user in Buenos Aires. Cuevana does make ""thousands"" of dollars in monthly advertising revenue, according to Escobar, but all the money goes to maintaining the site. Cuevana has no employees, only volunteers, but Escobar concedes that the website could one day make him very rich. ""Right now we are just working hard to improve and continue to be the number 1 option in Latin America,"" he says. The key concept that Escobar and many of Cuevana's users are trying to promote is that major studios need to accept that the paradigm is changing. Escobar points to the music industry as a cautionary tale, and says executives must realize that users will ultimately decide how content is consumed online, and how much they will pay for it. ""The music industry had the opportunity to legalize all music, and by not doing so, it just grew and then you had like 10 Napsters,"" says Escobar. Increasing access to technology, and overall lower salaries in the region have also contributed to the Latin American mindset that content should be free, and it may be too late to change that, according to Escobar. ""There has been a major change of mind -- and in Latin America probably most of all -- because services like Google, Facebook and Twitter are all free, and the user has started to expect those services for free,"" Escobar says. Some companies are betting that Latin Americans will start paying for movies and TV shows online. Netflix entered the Latin American market in September offering streaming content for about $9 dollars a month. Like Netflix, Escobar says he wants to strike legitimate distribution deals, so that both Cuevana's users and the studios will be happy, but he says it needs to be done with Latin American tastes in mind. ""People in Latin America are already complaining that Netflix doesn't have enough content specifically for them. Until they do, I don't think they will be successful,"" Escobar says. ""Consumers here just want to be treated as equals to U.S. consumers.""","A website created in a bedroom is attracting lawsuits from international companies .

"(CNN) -- In the lead up to every New Year's Eve the inevitable question of how to celebrate arises. For most, waterfronts become the focal point of the celebrations. It's hard not to see why with the amazing firework displays looking even more dazzling reflected in the water. So jump in a boat or head to the foreshore for our the top 10 places to countdown to 2012. River Seine, Paris .

"(CNN) -- It's happened. The build-up and anxiety over whether folks like Chris Christie and Sarah Palin are going to throw their hats in the ring for the GOP presidential primary has reached critical mass. And now, the will-they-or-won't-they game has flipped from fun and energizing to damaging to the party. Christie and Palin now do conservatives more harm than good. With the question marks still lingering in the ether, and pundits on both sides of the aisle still performing their daily trapeze act -- swinging back and forth between ""yes, he's running"" and ""no, she isn't"" -- the focus on Christie and Palin has taken valuable resources and attention away from the rest of the field. Because of those question marks, conservatives haven't been able to invest fully in the candidates who are running. They haven't been able to imagine one of them as president. They've held back support, money and endorsements, because they still don't know that the field is settled. And Christie and Palin are not entirely without fault. Though the bombastic New Jersey governor had been emphatic in his promise not to run for months, despite our continued speculation that he was fibbing, now his friends are saying otherwise. And he's certainly been acting like a candidate, traveling the country for big-ticket fundraisers, speaking at the exalted Reagan Library, and telling his supporters that he's ""hearing"" and ""feeling"" their pleas. If he really wanted to convince us he wasn't considering it, all he has to do is endorse someone else. It's really very simple. As for Palin, she's been forthright about her contemplation, admitting that she's thinking about it but hasn't yet decided. As formidable and admirable as both Christie and Palin are, it's reached the point where they've both become more than just a distraction. They're now a detriment. How sincere will it look, after all, in two months when the field is set and both are absent from it, and conservatives suddenly try to pretend that they are satisfied and enthusiastic about Rick Perry, Mitt Romney or Michele Bachmann? Sure, we begged Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Paul Ryan, Chris Christie, Sarah Palin and everyone else to run before, but now we're totally behind one of these guys. If there were ever a gift to present to President Obama, it's the gift of obvious apathy. Time's up, governors. If Chris Christie and Sarah Palin want to run, get in there. If not, definitively and convincingly take your names out of the running. Conservatives need to begin the arduous job of whittling down the field and picking their frontrunner. The fact that there have been five GOP straw polls in as many weeks with as many different winners is proof that these unanswered questions are creating a dangerous ambivalence among conservative voters. The breathless speculation has been fun, but now it's time to get to work. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of S.E. Cupp.","Are Chris Christie and Sarah Palin running for president, or aren't they?
Their refusal to answer definitively is damaging to the GOP, said S.E. Cupp .
Conservatives haven't been able to invest fully in the candidates who are running, Cupp said .

"(CNN) -- Two people died and 13 others were injured in four separate shootings in New Orleans early Tuesday, including one on Bourbon Street where costumed revelers were celebrating Halloween. The first shooting, just after midnight outside a Bourbon Street nightclub, sent people running for cover, CNN affiliate WWL reported. A 25-year-old man was shot several times and died at a hospital, police said. Seven other people, ranging in age from 19 to 50, were also injured. ""Apparently one or two people were shooting or shooting at each other for reasons unknown when eight people were struck by the gunfire,"" New Orleans police said in a statement. The injuries to those wounded in that incident appeared to be non-life-threatening, authorities said. Police were still searching for a suspect or suspects Tuesday. Video from the scene showed evidence markers lying next to Mardi Gras beads on the street and the area cordoned off with crime scene tape as music continued to spill from nearby Bourbon Street bars. ""I've never seen so many people on Bourbon Street scatter to the sides,"" one woman, who was not identified, told WWL. ""I've never seen that in my life."" She said she saw the shooting, but was ""traumatized"" and unable to run. ""I was so scared,"" she said. A second shooting took place about 1:45 a.m. on Canal Street, police said. A 19-year-old man was killed and three other people injured. Officers heard gunshots while on patrol and saw three males running from the scene, police spokesman Garry Flot said in a statement. After a foot pursuit, two men were apprehended. One of the men was questioned and released, but a 24-year-old faces charges of first-degree murder and three counts of attempted first-degree murder, police said. Two other shootings took place in different locations later in the morning, Flot said, and a total of three people were injured. WWL said the two other shootings took place about 4 and 5:30 a.m. CNN's Karan Olson Meilhan, Scott Thompson and Samuel Gardner III contributed to this report.","NEW: A total of four separate shootings took place overnight .

"(CNN) -- Cuban President Raul Castro's daughter joined Twitter to set the record straight about an interview she did abroad, but ended up arguing with one of the communist island's prominent dissidents online. Mariela Castro Espin wrote on her Twitter account, @CastroEspinM, that she recently made a trip to Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and toured the city's infamous red light district in her role as director for Cuba's National Center for Sexual Education. An interview with Radio Netherlands characterized Castro Espin as ""impressed"" with the way the Dutch organize their prostitution. But on Twitter, Castro Espin said the conversation was taken out of context and that she would use social media to clarify her position. ""Without a doubt, there have been misunderstandings, manipulations, as always. At least there is the Web... and WikiLeaks,"" she wrote on Twitter. Shortly afterward, Castro Espin was ""welcomed"" to the social networking site by Cuban dissident Yoani Sanchez, an outspoken critic of the Castro regime and avid Twitter user. ""Welcome to the plurality of Twitter,"" Sanchez tweeted to Castro Espin. ""Here no one can shut me up, or deny me permission to travel or block my entry."" Castro Espin shot back: ""Your focus on tolerance reproduces the old mechanisms of power. To improve your 'services' you need to study."" While there is long-running animosity between dissidents and the government, it is not common for the two sides to exchange barbs in such a public forum. A bevy of critical replies to Castro Espin must have followed, for then she wrote on Twitter: ""Despicable parasites: Did you receive the order from your employers to respond in unison and with the same predetermined script? Be creative."" In Cuba, where Internet access is limited or prohibitively expensive, many citizens use Twitter as a form of communicating, as Tweets can be posted from a simple text message. Castro Espin is the niece of Fidel Castro. Her father, Raul Castro, assumed presidential duties from Fidel in 2006, and became president in 2008. Castro Espin's organization promotes gay rights in Cuba. That fight for equal rights in Cuba led Sanchez to ask another question of Castro Espin on Twitter: ""How can you ask for acceptance just for one issue? Is tolerance universal or not?"" Castro Espin did not answer.","Raul Castro's daughter joined Twitter to discuss a recent trip .

""Obviously, it's been a very difficult day for the family today,"" said spokeswoman Emma Fedor. ""In some ways, it was a bit of a relief for the family."" Joseph's family had refused to accept a recommendation by a Canadian hospital to remove the boy's breathing tube and allow him to die. In March, the infant received a tracheotomy at a children's hospital in St. Louis, Missouri. He was able to go home April 21. ""By providing him with this common palliative procedure, we've given Joseph the chance to go home and be with his family after spending so much of his young life in the hospital,"" said Dr. Robert Wilmott, chief of pediatrics for SSM Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center in St. Louis. A London, Ontario, hospital where Joseph was receiving care for a progressive neurological disease refused to perform a tracheotomy, a surgical procedure in which an opening is made into the airway through an incision in the neck to allow for suction of fluid out of the lungs. In court papers, doctors in Canada said there was no hope for recovery. They would not perform a tracheotomy because they considered it to be invasive and not recommended for patients who require a long-term breathing machine. Parents Moe and Sana Maraachli refused to accept the recommendation. The Maraachlis' daughter, Zeina, had died at home in 2002 after a tracheotomy after suffering similar complications, and the family wanted to offer the same care to their son. ""To go through it once is enough for a lifetime, to go through it twice, it's just ... unbelievable,"" Fedor said. Joseph was ""very peaceful, in no pain whatsoever, no distress,"" when he died, Fedor said. He was buried Wednesday next to his sister. The family was thankful for those who helped and prayed for Joseph, she added. ""The heart of the issue would come down to the mix between respecting the parents' rights ... to be in comfort of (their) own home, to die on God's time,"" said Fedor. The family countered assertions that Joseph was nonresponsive, blind and deaf, she said. Instead, the boy could hear the parents' voices and look for them, Fedor told CNN. The family believed that, after a tracheotomy, Joseph could be freed from machinery. The parents said that they, rather than physicians, should make a judgment on quality of life, Fedor said. The Maraachli case caught the attention of the group Priests for Life, which funded Joseph's transfer and treatment at the SSM Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center. That hospital deemed the procedure medically appropriate and Baby Joseph underwent a tracheotomy there on March 21. In April, Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, said he considered this a ""victory over the culture of death."" He says ""(Joseph) has gained benefit from his tracheotomy, is breathing on his own, and is going home to live with his parents."" Priests for Life is a Catholic pro-life organization that functions as a network to prevent abortion and euthanasia. The group often is noted for the graphic images depicting abortion its members and supporters use to make their case. The London Health Sciences Centre -- the hospital where Joseph was initially treated -- in March said that ""there are clearly differences in the approach of these centres to the management of end-of-life care in this tragic situation"" and that ""the medical judgments made by LHSC physicians remain unchallenged by any credible medical source."" Nurses helped the family provide 24-hour care for Joseph in his final months. ""There was always somebody by his side,"" Fedor said. The child was on almost no medication and apparently was in no pain, Fedor said. ""When he was in the arms of his parents, you could tell,"" she said. ""He was settled when he was in their arms.""","Joseph Maraachli suffered from a progressive neurological disease .

"Seattle, Washington (CNN) -- Instead of the traditional bad guys, it was the costumed, self-styled superhero that ended up behind bars after an altercation Sunday in Seattle. Phoenix Jones, the moniker used by a man who dons a skintight black-and-gold rubber suit and mask, was arrested on four counts of assault after allegedly trying to break up a fight with pepper spray, the Seattle Police Department said. According to the statement, a group of men and women were leaving a downtown Seattle club at 2:32 a.m. Sunday and ""were dancing and having a good time"" when an ""unknown adult male suspect came up from behind and pepper sprayed the group,"" the statement said. ""He inserted himself and sprayed them with pepper spray,"" Seattle Police spokesman Mark Jamieson told CNN. Jones was arrested and charged with four counts of assault, Jamieson said. But Jones claimed he used the pepper spray only to break up a fight and to protect himself. ""I would never hurt or harm another person if they were not causing harm to another human being,"" read a message from Jones on his Facebook page. For about a year, the masked Jones has patrolled the streets of Seattle, often with a film crew in tow, looking for crime and generating international headlines. Jamieson said it is unclear how many -- if any -- crimes Jones has assisted police with. Police urge people to call 911 rather than take the law into their own hands, he added. On a video released by Jones of the incident that led to his arrest, Jones is heard telling the film crew to call 911, then rushes into a crowd of people who appear to be engaged in an altercation. A spokesman for Jones said he had no recourse but to get involved. ""The fight was a huge group of people against a smaller group,"" said Peter Tangen. ""It was an unfair fight, he went there to break it up."" A chaotic scene unfolds on the 13-minute video after Jones runs toward a man and woman who appear to be fighting. The man walks away and the woman then tries to hit Jones with her purse but instead falls onto the street. ""What is this, Halloween?"" another woman calls out to rubber-suited Jones. Eventually Jones is seen spraying several of the individuals with what appears to be a can of pepper spray. Police spokesman Jamieson said Jones' actions were overkill. ""If you see something that warrants calling 911, call 911. You don't need to dress up in a costume to do that."" Tangen asked CNN and other media not publish Jones' real name, which is listed in his police booking. ""His family is at risk of retaliation from criminals,"" he said. Many, but not all, news outlets were going along with the request. After he was arrested Sunday and before he was released without bond, Tangen said, Jones was roughed up by two men in the cell he was being held in. The spokesman said Jones was wearing his costume but police had taken away his mask. Tangen said Jones was shoved but was not seriously hurt and plans to keep fighting crime despite his run-in with police. ""He will always be an activist,"" Tangen said.","Phoenix Jones, as he calls himself, says he jumped in to stop a fight .

"(CNN) -- The attorney representing the 22-year-old Kentucky soldier charged with attempted espionage and communicating military information said Tuesday that his client told him he is innocent. ""Generally speaking, yes -- that he is not guilty of attempted espionage or spying against the United States,"" Stephen Karns said of what the solider told him. Spc. William Colton Millay of Owensboro, Kentucky, was charged this week with attempted espionage and communicating military information, allegations that have shocked friends who have described him as a patriotic country boy. The formal charges were issued 10 days after Millay was arrested at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, said Col. Bill Coppernoll, the public affairs officer at the base. According to a statement from the base, issued Monday, Millay ""communicated and transmitted unclassified national defense information to an individual whom he believed was a foreign intelligence agent."" The Army specialist ""believed (this information) could be used to the advantage of a foreign nation."" A charge of failure to obey general regulations stems from an assertion that Millay did not ""report multiple contacts with someone he believed to be a foreign intelligence agent."" He is also accused of ""wrongfully concealing and storing two firearms and ammunition in his assigned barracks room."" The military further alleges that Millay ""wrongfully solicited a fellow-service member to obtain classified information and tangible items"" so that they could be given to a foreign intelligence agent, leading to a charge of solicitation. He is also charged with making false statements, having allegedly not been forthright in telling Army counterintelligence officials ""the full scope"" of his attempted contacts with other governments and ""the full nature"" of what he'd disclosed to the believed-to-be foreign agent. Military authorities did not disclose what information specifically Millay allegedly obtained and disclosed, but they described it as not classified. Nor did they state which country he believed that information was going to, via a ""foreign intelligence agent."" He is currently being held at the Anchorage Correctional Complex, according to the military statement. Karns, Millay's attorney, said that it may be important that the material allegedly involved in the case was not classified. ""It is very serious charges. My hope is it is not going to amount to what they are claiming,"" he said. Having enlisted in the Army in November 2007, Millay was based in South Korea and Fort Stewart, Georgia, and spent one tour of combat duty in Iraq before being assigned to the Alaska base in May, according to the military statement. He was assigned to the 164th Military Police Company, 793rd Military Police Battalion, 2nd Engineer Brigade, known as the ""Arctic Enforcers."" Longtime friend Drew Bramschreiber of Owensboro has said Millay hardly fit the spy persona. ""He's just a simple country boy,"" he said. ""He was never the kind of guy who would get into trouble."" Another friend, Janssen Payne, said last week that Millay idolized his brother, who is also in the Army, and that he had been in the ROTC program in high school. He was a supporter of President George W. Bush and the U.S. war effort in Iraq and Afghanistan, his friend said. ""You've got the wrong guy,"" Payne said. ""That's just not who he is.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Protesters rallied in Washington on Saturday to raise awareness of violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo following contested elections there in November. They said they traveled from 25 states to deliver an urgent message to U.S. President Barack Obama. ""We need President Obama to help restore the leadership the Congo needs,"" said George Alula, president of the Movement of the Congolese Unity. He urged the international community to recognize opposition candidate Etienne Tshisekedi as the election's legitimate winner. Congo's highest court struck down a lawsuit challenging the election results in December, declaring incumbent Joseph Kabila the winner. ""We are frustrated because the Congolese people gave their voice in the November elections ... We know that the election organized in Congo was fraudulent,"" said Alula. International and national election observers have strongly questioned the veracity of the results, citing a lack of credibility and transparency. Late last month, Human Rights Watch said security forces have killed more than 24 people and arbitrarily detained dozens more since Kabila was declared the winner. Ben Kalala, who returned from Kinshasa just a few days ago and is president of the Congolese Foundation of America, accused the Congolese president of intimidating citizens and denying them their political voice. ""You see the military in cities ready to kill -- like the country is at war,"" he said. The November elections were only the second democratic vote in the country since the end of its civil war in 2003. The 2006 election, which brought Kabila to power, was declared largely free and fair by international observers.","Protesters want President Obama to ""help restore the leadership the Congo needs""

"New York (CNN) -- A New York man is suing two airlines for $10 million, saying he was injured when he tackled the ""underwear bomber"" during a Detroit-bound flight on Christmas Day in 2009. Theophilus Maranga filed the lawsuit Wednesday in U.S. District Court in New York, alleging that he sustained physical and psychological injuries during the incident. He is suing Delta Airlines and Air France-KLM for neglecting to prevent Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab from boarding Flight 253 on Northwest Airlines, which merged with Delta Airlines. Both airlines declined to comment on the lawsuit. It is unclear how federal agencies partner with authorities abroad to screen for potentially dangerous passengers aboard U.S.-bound flights and what responsibilities airlines bear in that process. The 2009 incident -- referenced in the lawsuit -- started when passengers heard a loud noise aboard the plane, sounding much like a firecracker, according to Jonathan Tukel, chief of the National Security Unit for the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of Michigan. AbdulMutallab became enveloped in a fireball that then spread to the wall and carpeting of the plane, yet he remained in his seat ""expressionless, completely blank,"" Tukel said. Four passengers restrained him and helped put out the fire, he added, and AbdulMutallab was escorted up to the first-class section of the plane. Georgia resident Dimitrios Bessis said he was among the passengers who put out the fire. Michael Zantow, a 20-year Army veteran, was another of those who tried to restrain the suspected bomber. Within a minute of the loud sound on the plane, a passenger said to AbdulMutallab, ""Hey man, your pants are on fire!"" Zantow later testified. The Nigerian native, who in October pleaded guilty to trying to blow up the airplane, is facing the prospect of life behind bars. U.S. officials say the terror group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was behind the bombing attempt. Earlier this week, AbdulMutallab -- who has been acting as his own court representative -- asked U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds to replace attorney Anthony Chambers, who had been advising him. In a handwritten letter to Edmunds, he said wants a different adviser, preferably a Muslim male attorney, citing that his relationship with Chambers had been strained.","A man is suing two airlines for $10 million .

"(CNN) -- Former top Pakistani military officers Sunday called for Pakistan's former strongman to be allowed back without facing arrest and condemned what they called the ""bashing"" of the country's armed forces. More than 100 former officers, most of them generals and admirals, signed their names to a letter calling for Pervez Musharraf to be allowed to return to Pakistan ""and contest elections according to democratic norms."" The retired brass included the retired Gen. Muhammad Aziz Khan, once the head of Pakistan's joint chiefs of staff during part of Musharraf's rule, and Adm. Shahid Karimullah, who served as head of the navy under Musharraf. ""We feel that Gen. (R) Pervez Musharraf should be provided with a level playing field in the political arena and also provided protocol and security as befits any ex-president of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,"" wrote the officers, who have formed a group they called ""Pakistan First."" Musharraf, who seized power in a 1999 coup, has been living in London and Dubai since resigning in 2008. He had announced plans to return from exile in late January and run in upcoming elections -- but his party said he was reassessing those plans when Pakistan's elected government warned that if he returned, he faced arrest in connection with the 2007 assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. A U.N. report in 2010 accused Musharraf's government of failing to protect Bhutto, who had returned to Pakistan from her own exile to run for office. Musharraf has denied the allegations, arguing that Bhutto had police protection and took unnecessary risks, but a Pakistani court issued a warrant for his arrest. Bhutto's widower, Asif Ali Zardari, is now Pakistan's president. If Musharraf were to return, he would be walking into the middle of a public squabble between Pakistan's civilian and uniformed leadership that was sparked by a memo that allegedly asked for U.S. help to rein in the military. In Sunday's letter, the ex-generals said they opposed the ""bashing"" of Pakistan's army and its powerful Inter-Services Intelligence agency. ""We feel that erosion of these institutions can only lead to weakening of Pakistan's position as a sovereign and proud nation,"" they wrote. ""This forum feels that while all state institutions must be allowed to function within the purview of their respective roles, the demands of national dignity and state security dictate that all organs of the state as well as the media persistently raise and maintain the prestige and morale of the nation and its armed forces, both at home and abroad."" Zardari faces his own legal problems. His prime minister, Yousuf Raza Gilani, appeared before Pakistan's supreme court Thursday in a battle over corruption cases facing the president and other officials, telling reporters the president has ""full immunity"" from prosecution under an amnesty granted by Musharraf before Zardari and Bhutto returned in 2007. In 2009, the justices ruled that amnesty was unconstitutional and called on the government to reopen the cases. The government has not done so, and the court has cited Gilani for contempt.","Musharraf has been living in exile in London and Dubai since resigning in 2008 .

"(CNN) -- Lewis Hamilton won his first Formula One grand prix in almost four months as world champion Sebastian Vettel spun out of the race in Abu Dhabi during the opening lap. McLaren's British driver took full advantage of Vettel's slip up -- the first time the 2010 and 2011 title holder has retired from a race since the Korean Grand Prix last year. Hamilton fended off the challenge of Fernando Alonso's Ferrari while Jenson Button clung onto third in the face of fierce competition initially from Red Bull's Mark Webber and then from Alonso's teammate Felipe Massa. Vettel, who secured the 2011 crown last month, had his lead at the top of the drivers' championship cut to 119 points by Button, who sits on 255. Hamilton stays fifth on 227 points but closed on Alonso in third (245) and Webber (233). Latest F1 standings after Abu Dhabi GP . It marked Hamilton's third victory in what has been a difficult season for the 2008 world champion, who admitted before the race that personal problems had contributed to his below-par campaign. ""I feel fantastic,"" Hamilton said in a post-race press conference. ""It was one of my best races. To hold off one of the best drivers in the world is very tough to do. ""I'm just happy. This is great. It's early days but this is definitely the start of something. We've got another great race ahead of us in Brazil. I've just got to keep my mind on the game."" Starting second on the grid, Hamilton watched Vettel beat him into the first corner but at the second a puncture to the German's back right tire sent him spinning off the track. Vettel trundled round the circuit and made it back to the pit lane but Red Bull's mechanics decreed the damage too severe for him to rejoin the battle. After the race he told reporters: ""I don't know what happened. We lost pressure all of a sudden out of the exit of turn one. I don't why. There is nothing that I did differently to any of the other laps. ""We need to find out why, maybe I cut the kerb at a funny angle. It is tough, but I used the opportunity to learn a bit on the pit wall."" In his absence Hamilton maintained a two-second gap over Alonso for most of the race, while Webber and Button's battle saw them swap third and fourth place regularly. Alonso did hold the lead for four laps after Hamilton's second pit stop but he couldn't build up enough of a cushion to rejoin the race ahead of his former McLaren teammate. The Spaniard said: ""It was a fantastic race for me as well. We fight most of the race three-five seconds distance to Lewis. ""We were close but we had some traffic in the pit entry behind a HRT and in the last stint they had a little bit more pace so it would have been difficult to win the race even if we had got into the lead. ""I'm happy with second.""","Lewis Hamilton wins only his third grand prix of the Formula One season in Abu Dhabi .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- It's 6:30 a.m., and Paul Barlow is chatting with his friends over a breakfast buffet of eggs, bacon and fresh fruit. Dressed in a dark gray blazer, Barlow waits to take his seat in the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Center's auditorium for a special concert by the Dekalb Symphony Orchestra. But the musicians aren't playing for Barlow and his friends. They're playing for Billy Crystal, Bette Midler and the rest of the ""Parental Guidance"" cast. Once the violins sound and the cameras start rolling, Barlow will merely fade into the background, along with the other 300 movie extras on set. The 55-year-old first started working as an extra in November 2010 to provide for his family amid the downturn of his ad sales career. Since losing his job in April, he's become a staple on movie and TV sets around Georgia -- and he's not the only one. Many of the ""concertgoers"" present at the shoot for ""Parental Guidance,"" due out in November 2012, were between jobs, or looking for a fun way to make extra (pun intended) cash. The recession definitely pushed some people into extra work, said Linda Burns, a commercial and independent film producer who leads a workshop called ""How To Be an Extra and On Set Protocol."" Burns said half the class is usually made up of recent graduates with a passion for acting, while the other 50% are ""people who lost their jobs and love movies and TV."" ""If you're not working at all,"" she said, ""and if you don't qualify for unemployment ... you're going to make more money on set than you are in your house filling out job applications. There's so much downtime on set. It allows you time to read or look for those jobs online with your smartphone."" And while extra work makes a great supplemental income, Burns said treating it like a full time job -- as Barlow has for the past year -- might be financially challenging. Movie extras in Georgia typically make between $58 and $101.50 for an 8- to 12-hour day. Compare that to the $140 an extra makes in Los Angeles or New York for the same 8 hours. Screen Actors Guild rates are higher than the non-union wages extras are entitled to in Georgia, casting director Bill Marinella said. ""If you're hiring somebody at minimum wage ... they might not show,"" he added. Extras are asked to drive to set, bring different outfits, and then pay to have those outfits dry-cleaned -- it would end up costing them money to be there, he said. But beyond the commitment, Marinella said there's ""little skill involved in being a movie extra. ... It's all based on a look, and then whatever skills you may have."" And Barlow certainly has a look. Like the extra says, ""My eyebrows are what's making me the money."" ""He's just a character,"" Marinella said. ""You can't help but look at him. He has an interesting face."" Marinella originally planned to use Barlow as a stand-in for Eugene Levy on ""American Reunion,"" but despite the men's equally bushy brows, they weren't close enough in height. Instead, Barlow plays a caterer in the film, which will hit theaters in April 2012. In addition to height, skin tone, hair color and, in some cases, eyebrows, movie extras need an appropriate wardrobe. The orchestra scene for the Crystal- and Midler-starrer called for conservative, upscale dress -- hence Barlow's gray blazer and button-down shirt. ""I probably have about seven suits from being a salesman,"" Barlow said. ""That's the number one thing you need as a guy my age. A guy in his 50s is always playing a businessman."" But a fancy suit isn't always a good thing. ""Extras run the risk of being seen in front of the camera when their wardrobe is so damn glamorous,"" Marinella said. And though it seems like a close-up would be welcomed by movie extras, to be invited back to set, which means another paycheck, extras need to remain hidden in the background. ""You can't make a movie with the same extras,"" Marinella explained. Viewers would notice if the person playing a bartender showed up in the next scene as a lawyer. That's why Burns teaches her extras to lay low on set. Don't be so dramatic that you become a distraction, she warns. The other rule? Avoid wearing clothes that don't translate well on film. That means any small pattern, and colors like red, black and white. Since Barlow has been on the extra scene, he's appeared in more than 20 productions. Some of which are ""The Three Stooges,"" ""American Reunion,"" ""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"" and Lifetime's ""Drop Dead Diva."" And he had a speaking role in August's ""The Change-Up"" -- he played an ""amalgamated attorney."" A speaking role is the extra Holy Grail. It means a significant pay increase, too. Despite such opportunities, Barlow says it's not a glamorous job. He once heard a crew member say, 'Here comes the furniture,' when the extras walked on set. ""I need the money so bad, I can't miss a day on set,"" Barlow said, calling extra work the lowest paying job he'll ever love. But the work doesn't dictate every extra's livelihood. Barbara Derketsch, an usher at the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Center, is someone Marinella refers to as a specialty extra. No stranger to the role, Derketsch was asked to play an usher in ""Parental Guidance."" ""We used the real ushers ... because they know how to walk. We don't have to teach them how to walk. ... They gesture with their hands a certain way,"" Marinella said. And the same goes for basketball players, nurses, ballerinas, waiters and so on. ""[Waiters] are used to standing on their feet. ... They carry a tray a certain way. ... To me, that's a skill,"" Marinella said. ""I'll give you an extra $20, $50 because you're a real waiter. ... The director won't have to say 'cut' to some knucklehead who doesn't even know how to carry a tray."" Derketsch, who filmed a scene with Crystal that could make it to the big screen, said the ushers were given film-friendly uniforms to wear for the shoot. Usually dressed in white shirts, red vests and black bow ties -- the three most distracting colors to shoot -- the ushers in the film were provided with blue shirts and black vests and ties for the scene. Another first-time extra, Cameron Gaines, took time off from teaching preschool to appear as a concertgoer in the film. Gaines, who acted in high school and college, said she was curious to see how movies are made, and what being an extra was all about. But at the end of the shoot, when Gaines heads back to the classroom, extras like Barlow, who are hoping to make it in the biz, will move on to the next set. There are so many possible ways to earn money in the film industry, Burns says, . ""[Extra work] is the easiest way to get in the door when you don't have experience,"" she added. ""It has helped [people] move into better paying positions and find a whole new career."" ""There's no doubt I love being in front of the camera,"" Barlow said. ""But I'm starting to discover ... that I could probably write a script. ... Down the line I could see it."" For now, he says, his goal is to make a decent living and support his family doing this.","The recession pushed some people into extra work, producer says .

"(CNN) -- Terry Thompson, the Ohio man who authorities say set his exotic animals free just before killing himself, once supplied a lion cub for a photo shoot with supermodel Heidi Klum. ""I wrote a letter to Heidi Klum's people,"" said Larry Hostetler, the executive director of the Animal Shelter Society of Muskingum County. ""I strongly voiced my opinion that if they're going to hire animals for entertainment, they might want to check handlers' backgrounds -- that Terry Thompson had been convicted of animal cruelty. ""Of course, I never heard anything back."" Thompson and his wild animal farm had long been on authorities' radar. Thompson had been kicked out of the local pet fair for bringing exotic animals that snarled at children. He had been convicted in November 2005 of animal cruelty, allowing an animal to roam freely and rendering animal waste without a license. He had even threatened to let all his animals go when investigators visited after repeated calls of animal abuse or neglect. But while investigators kept a close eye on him, Thompson professed his love for his animals to most anyone. He would often be seen driving down the road with a wild animal. ""My cats are happier than most people,"" Thompson once told the Zanesville Times-Recorder. ""I feed them every day, and they have a great place to live. How many people can say they have all they can eat and don't have to worry about a place to live?"" In a 2008 video in New York, Thompson is seen smiling, holding a cub and handing it over to model Klum. ""We heard about Terry Thompson from all of his work in movies and commercials and felt he had a great track record. The day of our shoot, he was very kind, loving and protective towards his animals,"" said Christoph KÃ¶rfer, the head of the German TV-station ProSieben in charge of the shoot. ""This is definitely a tragic situation."" Yet on Tuesday, a strained marriage collided with the stress and the expense of caring for so many animals, people close to the investigation told CNN. ""He was so depressed he said, 'That's it. I'm going to let them go,' "" said Columbus Zoo director emeritus Jack Hanna, who helped authorities in the search for the wild animals. The 62-year-old Thompson had been released from prison in recent weeks after serving a year behind bars on an illegal firearms conviction. Authorities say Thompson unlocked his animal cages, opened the farm's gates and shot himself to death. Thompson freed dozens of exotic animals -- from Bengal tigers to grizzly bears to baboons -- setting off a frightening scenario outside Zanesville, a town of 25,000 in central Ohio. Authorities killed at least 49 animals, including 18 rare tigers. ""What happened here was one of the largest animal escapes in our country's history,"" said Hanna. Sheriff Matt Lutz defended his officers, saying they had no choice but to kill the roaming animals. ""I had deputies that had to shoot animals with sidearms at close range. That's how volatile this situation was."" Thompson was known as a flamboyant, volatile man. The sheriff's department had been to the property on dozens of occasions over the last decade to check into reports of animal cruelty or animals on the loose. Thompson would stare down those who entered his property with his steely blue eyes. He'd cuss and scream. ""I'll be damned,"" Thompson would shout, according to county Humane Officer David Durst. ""I'll let them animals go!"" ""He was definitely a different breed,"" said Durst, who investigates every case of animal cruelty in the county. ""We were just afraid that this was going to happen. It wasn't a matter of if it was going to happen, it was a matter of when."" Durst said Thompson would often buy his exotic animals from people in other states and offer to host them on his property for vacation. ""They'd visit and see the situation and they'd freak out and they'd call me,"" he said. ""They'd say, 'I was horrified.'"" In the last year, even while Thompson was imprisoned on the weapons charges, Durst said he got at least one call a month about animals roaming loose. Every time he visited Thompson's farm, Durst was escorted by at least three sheriff's deputies because he feared for his safety. He said local authorities had alerted the U.S. Department of Agriculture, state representatives and other power players about their fears concerning Thompson and his wild animals. ""And now we're dealing with this."" Hostetler with the Animal Shelter Society said Thompson was an animal collector who had a horrible reputation for the treatment of his animals. Opinion: Wild animals should be left in the wild . ""It's been a nightmare out there for a decade,"" Hostetler said. ""I never thought he'd do something like he's done. But I knew eventually something bad would happen out there."" Hostetler said Thompson would bring his wild animals to the shelter's annual pet fair, where people bring their dogs and cats. Thompson showed up once with bear cubs, once with tiger cubs and another time with a baby ape. Children would rush toward the exotic animals. ""The animals were growling and snarling back at the children,"" Hostetler said. Every year, officials would ask Thompson to leave the fair. He'd argue it was his right to bring his animals. It got so testy that officials eventually changed the rules just to keep Thompson and his animals away. Now, only domestic house pets are welcome. Durst and Hostetler said officials had tried to get state and federal authorities to take control of the animals while Thompson was imprisoned in the last year. ""We were trying and trying to get help,"" Durst said. ""Hopefully a tragedy like this will get the ball rolling with the state of Ohio and the ownership of exotic animals. ""The laws are so weak in Ohio, it's ridiculous. You can have one permit and pretty much have all the exotic animals you want."" Added Hostetler: ""For me the sad part of this is that the court system could've removed those animals, and it's really sad it reached this point."" The Humane Society of the United States urged Ohio officials Wednesday to issue an emergency rule to crack down on exotic animal ownership. A previous emergency order issued by then-Gov. Ted Strickland that prohibited people convicted of animal cruelty from owning exotic animals expired in April. The Humane Society said Thompson ""would almost certainly have had his animals removed by May 1, 2011, if the emergency order had not expired."" When he was first sentenced to animal cruelty charges in 2005, Thompson told the judge: ""I've learned a lot from this case, and I do love my animals."" Investigators have learned a lot from Thompson too, and must now contemplate what could have been done to stop Tuesday's tragedy. CNN's Ann O'Neill contributed to this report.","Terry Thompson had been convicted of animal cruelty charges in 2005 .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Poppy production in Afghanistan is at record levels and is threatening the government and security there, the U.S. State Department said in a report on worldwide drug sales and production. In a photo from last year, villagers tend to opium poppies in southern Afghanistan. ""Although President [Hamid] Karzai has strongly attacked narco-trafficking as the greatest threat to Afghanistan, one-third of the Afghan economy remains opium-based,"" the International Narcotics Control Strategy Report says. ""The government at all levels must be held accountable to deter and eradicate poppy cultivation, remove and prosecute corrupt officials."" Poppy production soared last year in southern provinces controlled by insurgents, Assistant Secretary of State David Johnson told reporters. ""There is incontrovertible evidence that the Taliban use drug trafficking proceeds to fund insurgent activities,"" he said. He said the United Nations is predicting that opium production in Afghanistan will fall slightly this year, after recent years of double-digit growth. The two-volume report contains more than 1,100 pages with details of drug sales and production. Twenty nations, including some major U.S. allies, were designated as major drug-producing or drug-transit countries. Burma (also known as Myanmar) and Venezuela were singled out as having ""failed demonstrably"" to live up to their obligations under anti-drug agreements. Also on the list are Afghanistan, the Bahamas, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay and Peru. Canada was criticized in the report for an increasingly sophisticated marijuana industry. ""We remain concerned that the production of high-potency indoor grown marijuana for export to the United States continues to thrive in Canada in part because growers do not consistently face strict legal punishment,"" the report said. Journalists were briefed on the report by Johnson, assistant secretary of state for international narcotics and law enforcement affairs.

"(CNN) -- Narain Karthikeyan says India is brimming with excitement on the eve of the country's first ever Formula One grand prix. The Buddh International Circuit, 50km outside the capital New Delhi, is set to welcome the world's fastest drivers at the weekend as it makes its Formula One debut and Karthikeyan thinks the event could spark a huge boom in the sport's popularity. As the only native driver in the race, Karthikeyan believes Sunday's Grand Prix is an important landmark both for himself and his country.

""With the circuit, again like everybody else, it is wide in some places, I am sure lots of different lines you are going to see, lots of overtaking,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Spaniard Jorge Lorenzo will miss the final race of 2011 MotoGP season in Valencia this weekend as he continues to recover from a finger injury. The Yamaha rider required plastic surgery to repair a damaged ring finger on his left hand after a crash in Australia three weeks ago. Lorenzo, 24, is guaranteed second place in the world championship due to the 48-point lead he holds over third-place Honda rider Andrea Dovizioso. Australian Casey Stoner has already secured this year's world championship. Japanese test rider Katsuyuki Nakasuga will replace the 2010 world champion for Sunday's race in the Spanish port city.

"(CNN) -- Formula One's big-name drivers have spoken of their desire to put on a sporting spectacle which Japan's motorsport fans can enjoy, as the country continues to recover from their devastating earthquake earlier this year. Japan was hit by a catastrophic quake and tsunami in March which left 27,000 people dead or missing, and F1's drivers have been telling of their continued support for the nation ahead of Sunday's race at Suzuka. Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel will seal a second consecutive world championship if he finishes higher than 10th in the race and the German expressed his admiration for the Japanese people. ""The fans in Japan are special,"" Vettel, who has won the last two grands prix in Japan, told Formula One's official website. ""What they have been through in recent times is something I cannot begin to imagine, but they are so impressive. F1 title race: Vettel on the brink . ""They are extremely patient and always polite and friendly and their stamina is amazing. I hope we can put on a good show for them this weekend."" McLaren's Jenson Button is the only other driver who can still mathematically overhaul Vettel and the 2009 title winner spoke of his fondness for Japan, saying the Asian country is a home away from home. ""I consider Japan my second home,"" Button, 31, said. ""It's a place that's very close to my heart, and, obviously, it's going to be a very emotional experience for me to be racing in Japan for the first time since the events of last March. ""I'm very proud that the Formula One world championship will put Japan on the world's sporting stage this weekend: while the country is still collectively rebuilding itself.

But that's when the thrill of driving a Formula One car is at its highest."" Kamui Kobayashi will be the sole Japanese racer on the grid this weekend, with the Sauber driver excited by the prospect of competing in front of his home crowd.

"State College, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Penn State students and alumni held a candlelight vigil late Sunday to honor and remember Joe Paterno, the iconic former football coach. Paterno, 85, died Sunday at a State College, Pennsylvania, hospital, according to his family. He had been suffering from lung cancer and had recently broken his pelvis. ""It is with great sadness that we announce that Joe Paterno passed away earlier today,"" said the statement. ""His loss leaves a void in our lives that will never be filled."" Students braved freezing temperatures to attend the vigil on the lawn of the Old Main building on Penn State's campus. They held candles, locked arms, and sung the school's alma mater to say goodbye. Later, they walked over to a statue of Paterno outside Beaver Stadium, which has become a sort of makeshift memorial. ""He's more than a coach; his family's more than a family,"" said Bethanna Edmiston, a local resident and alumna who met her husband at Penn State. ""It's extremely difficult for the whole Nittany nation,"" she said. ""Unless you're part of Penn State, you just don't understand what it means."" Share your thoughts on Paterno's death . Earlier on Sunday, many fans were seen crying as they stood at the statue. It features Paterno with his index finger outstretched in the ""No. 1"" gesture. A quote from Paterno, who spent 61 years at Penn State, is on the wall behind the statue. ""They ask me what I'd like written about me when I'm gone,"" the quote says. ""I hope they write I made Penn State a better place, not just that I was a good football coach."" Edmiston said she moved to State College at age 8, as Paterno took the reins at Penn State. ""Our family thanks Penn Staters, students & all people for prayers & support for my Dad,"" Paterno's son, Jay Paterno, tweeted Sunday, ""He felt your support in his fight."" Family statement: ""He fought hard until the end"" The gathering at the statue has been ongoing since Saturday night, after a family spokesman said Paterno's condition had worsened. Some shoveled snow so others could walk up and touch Paterno's outstretched hand on his statue. Signs, flowers and candles surrounded the statue, along with photographs of Paterno. ""You're our hero,"" one said. Another one, flanked by candles, simply said: ""Coach."" Jay Paterno tweeted Saturday night that he drove by the statue, and that the love and support inspired his father. ""He died as he lived,"" the family statement said. ""He fought hard until the end, stayed positive, thought only of others and constantly reminded everyone of how blessed his life had been."" Media falsely report Paterno's death . Several websites that reported Saturday night that Paterno had died later apologized for the error, including the Penn State student news website Onward State, the first to report the erroneous information. Paterno was fired in November amid outrage over the handling of accusations against former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky, who faces more than 50 counts involving sexual acts with 10 boys since 1994. Sandusky has pleaded not guilty. But several of those gathered at the statue Sunday remembered Paterno as a unifying presence both at the university and in State College. ""I want everyone in our whole country to know that Joe united us,"" said Diane Farley, a Penn State alumna and current university employee. ""And I don't want anyone to point fingers at anyone anymore, and I want them to know that State College is a place that cares, because Joe cared, and there's just been a lot of confusion in the past six weeks ... We're all on this Earth together. We're all going to go out eventually, like Joe, and we need to be a little bit more loving and caring with each other."" ""They're just ordinary people,"" Edmiston said of the Paterno family. ""They lived in the same house since they moved there, not a fancy house, just everyday people. They gave everything they had to Penn State -- not only money, but their time, their efforts. It's just an amazing legacy that he's left behind."" Another man said he doesn't believe the scandal will tarnish Paterno's memory. ""It won't define him,"" said the man, who did not give his name. ""It wasn't who he was."" The family previously said Paterno had a treatable form of cancer. In December, he was admitted to a hospital after fracturing his pelvis when he slipped and fell at his home in State College. Under Paterno's 46-year leadership, the Nittany Lions won two national championships, went undefeated five times and finished in the top 25 national rankings 35 times, according to his official Penn State biography. Sports Illustrated: Paterno's legacy was more than the final chapter . At the time of Paterno's dismissal, Vice Chairman of Trustees John P. Surma said he hoped the school's 95,000 students and hundreds of thousands of alumni would believe the decision ""is in the best long-term interest of the university, which is much larger than athletic programs."" Paterno told the Washington Post this month he felt inadequate to deal with the initial allegation of abuse against Sandusky. ""I didn't know exactly how to handle it and I was afraid to do something that might jeopardize what the university procedure was,"" Paterno told the Post. ""So I backed away and turned it over to some other people, people I thought would have a little more expertise than I did. It didn't work out that way."" The former coach spoke with a raspy voice during the interview -- Paterno's first extensive comments since being fired. A Penn State graduate assistant, Mike McQueary, told the grand jury late last year that he had seen Sandusky ""with a boy in the shower and that it was severe sexual acts going on and that it was wrong and over the line."" He said he had gone to Paterno with what he saw. Paterno said he'd never been told the graphic details revealed in a grand jury report, but that he nevertheless reported the allegations to his boss, then-Athletic Director Tim Curley. Curley and Gary Schultz, a former university vice president, have been charged with perjury and failure to report the abuse allegations, which law enforcement did not learn about for several years. They have pleaded not guilty. ""You know, he didn't want to get specific,"" Paterno said about McQueary. ""And to be frank with you I don't know that it would have done any good, because I never heard of, of, rape and a man. So I just did what I thought was best. I talked to people that I thought would be, if there was a problem, that would be following up on it,"" he told The Washington Post. ""I called my superiors and I said, 'Hey, we got a problem, I think. Would you guys look into it?' Because I didn't know, you know ... I had never had to deal with something like that. And I didn't feel adequate,"" Paterno said. ""Joe was Penn State,"" Edmiston said. ""He made Penn State. And it's really a very sad, sad day for all of us.""

"(CNN) -- Lotus Renault driver Robert Kubica has confirmed that he will not be fit in time for the start of the 2012 Formula One season. The 26-year-old Pole, winner of the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix, missed the whole of this season after suffering serious injuries following a rallying crash in February. There had been some hope that Kubica would be fit enough to start the new campaign, but he released a statement on the team's official website confirming this would not be the case. Kubica said: ""I have come to the conclusion that I am not yet certain to be ready for the 2012 season. This was a difficult decision to make, but it is the most reasonable one. ""I know that Lotus Renault need to prepare for next year, and further extending deadlines would not have been the right thing to do. On a personal level, my recovery is very encouraging and my doctors keep being impressed."" Kubica added: ""I just need more time, as I want to be 100% ready before I commit to anything driving related."" Team principal Eric Boullier also released a statement, saying: ""Everybody in the team is, of course, very disappointed. Robert not driving in Australia at the start of next season is not what we were all hoping for. ""However, he has taken a very mature decision, acting in the best interests of Lotus Renault GP. As a team and as a family, we remain 100% behind him and we'll help as much as we can."" Kubica suffered a partial amputation of his forearm and compound fractures to his right elbow, shoulder and leg in the accident in Andorra last February. He subsequently had three operations and has undergone a lengthy period of rehabilitation but has so far not driven a car. Kubica's decision leaves the team with a choice of three drivers to fill its two seats, Vitaly Petrov, Bruno Senna and Romain Grosjean, unless they look outside their current line-up.","Robert Kubica's Formula One return with Renault has been delayed .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- Facing intense government pressure, Indian oil workers agreed to call off a three-day strike and go back to work, the Oil and Petroleum Ministry announced. Long queues at gas stations have become a common sight across India in recent days. The workers ended the strike Friday, after the government threatened to suspend, fire or arrest workers who did not return to their jobs. The impact of the strike had been felt across all major cities in India, including Mumbai and New Delhi, where motorists waited in long lines to purchase fuel. Police had been called in to maintain order at many stations. Power plants that rely on gas ran out, causing power cuts, and airlines were forced to delay flights. Some 45,000 workers walked off the job at the government-controlled oil companies Wednesday after the government refused their demands for higher pay. India's Home Minister P. Chidambaram had called on workers to end the strike immediately, saying it was ""placing an intolerable burden on the people."" He had said the army could be called in if the crisis deepened. Meanwhile, a separate nationwide strike by truck operators entered its sixth day, with some truck operators saying arrested strikers had to be released before talks could take place, the Press Trust of India reported. Five All India Motor Transport Congress leaders were arrested Friday on charges of disrupting the supply of commodities, the Indo-Asian News Service reported. ""We will not give up our agitation and will not hold any talks with the government until we are released unconditionally,"" AIMTC Secretary-General S. Venugopal told the news service.

"(CNN) -- Fernando Alonso is determined to banish his demons in Abu Dhabi as he returns to the track where his 2010 Formula One world championship chances disintegrated. The Ferrari driver was in pole position to grab his third career title last year, needing to finish in the top four to claim the crown. But the Italian team took the decision to bring Alonso into the pits at an early stage and he spent the rest of the race stuck behind Renault's Vitaly Petrov, finishing seventh, and handing Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel his first ever world championship. A dominant Vettel hasn't looked back, retaining his title with four races of the 2011 season to go and Alonso admits returning to the Yas Marina circuit will be a painful experience for him. ""It would not be honest if I told you I won't be a bit uncomfortable thinking about it when I see the paddock for the first time,"" Alonso wrote in his blog on Ferrari's official website. ""But then the feeling will vanish and it will leave room for the present, which is about aiming to do well this weekend and in the future: to learn as much as possible with next season in mind. ""It's right that it should be like that because in sport, as in the rest of life, you must always look ahead.

""I completely appreciate that winning will be very difficult,"" he said. ""In this closing part of the season the relative positions are very clear but we have also seen there are some conditions in which we can fight for victory: as happened in Suzuka, for example. ""We know if we all get everything right we can fight for the top three but our natural qualifying position is on the third row. Then in the race things can go differently but that is the realistic situation. ""So our target is the podium.

"(CNN) -- Double world champion Sebastian Vettel suffered a disrupted second practice session ahead of Sunday's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, with McLaren's Lewis Hamilton setting the pace on Friday. Red Bull driver Vettel was back at the track where he claimed the first of his two world championships 12 months ago -- the youngest driver to achieve the feat -- but the German spun out on the first corner of the Yas Marina Circuit.

Button, the 2009 world champion and running second this year, admitted to experimenting during his practice run on a track where passing has traditionally been difficult. ""I was playing around with overtaking on my long run,"" the 31-year-old said. ""But I still reckon it'll be difficult to overtake people in the DRS zones. ""So I think it's going to be a bit of a struggle to make moves stick in the race -- which means it's going to be important to qualify up at the front. It's tricky around here, but we made some good progress here this afternoon and evening."" Ferrari's Fernando Alonso also slid off having spent a short period leading the field. The double world champion eventually came home third ahead of Brazilian teammate Felipe Massa. Vettel's fellow Red Bull driver Mark Webber was fifth fastest, with seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher seventh for Mercedes. The 2011 campaign will finish at the Brazilian Grand Prix in Sao Paulo on November 27.","McLaren's Lewis Hamilton heads practice ahead of Sunday's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix .

"(CNN)  -- Soccer fans should not ""dwell"" on the hand ball committed by French player Thierry Henry, former teammate Zinedine Zidane said in his defense Saturday. French forward Henry admitted to using his hand illegally to set up the goal that gave his team a 2-1 aggregate victory Wednesday against Ireland. France's victory pushed Ireland out of a spot at the 2010 World Cup. ""What I just want to say is that Thierry Henry is not a cheater, even if it is a big foul and he committed it, let's not dwell on it,"" former teammate and captain for the French team, Zidane said to CNN affiliate BFMTV. ""I don't think he should take more blame. It's a fact of the game that's certainly difficult to accept for the Irish but something that happens very often on the football field. I just want to say that's a lot for Henry to take."" And Zidane knows what it's like to be in the spotlight -- for the good and bad. Zidane won every major honor in the game, including the 1998 World Cup. But during the last game of his 18-year professional career, he head-butted Italy's Marco Materazzi during the 2006 World Cup final game. France lost that match. France won Wednesday's match that has some Ireland fans feeling cheated. Video replays from the game shows Henry used his hand to stop the ball going out of play in extra time before he passed to William Gallas, who then scored the goal that secured France's place in the World Cup. The Football Association of Ireland (FAI) requested a replay of Wednesday's controversial game, but the governing body of world football, FIFA, declined Friday. The Irish association also called on the French Football Federation to replay the game. ""We regret that despite our best efforts for a replay, which would have restored the integrity of the game in front of a world-wide audience, our calls appear to have fallen on deaf ears at the French Football Federation,"" FAI chief John Delaney said in a statement. ""Without doubt, the credibility of fair-play has been damaged by this incident in front of a world-wide audience."" In its bid for a do-over, the FAI pointed to precedent set in 2005 when a World Cup qualifier between Uzbekistan and Bahrain was replayed after the referee was found to have committed a technical error. But a FIFA spokesman said the precedent did not apply to Wednesday's game because the referee in the 2005 match ""saw the incident in question and simply failed to apply the proper rules."" The FAI plans to ""continue to call on FIFA to take action to ensure that such damaging examples of cheating are not allowed to recur,"" Delaney said.","Former teammate Zinedine Zidane comes to defense of Thierry Henry .

"(CNN) -- World champion Casey Stoner won the Valencia MotoGP, the final race of the season, after a thrilling battle with American Ben Spies all the way to the line. Stoner led for most of the 30-lap race before Spies overtook him with three laps remaining. However, the Australian regained the lead to win by just one hundredth of a second and secure his 10th victory of a dominant season. Spies, who won his first ever MotoGP at Assen in June, had to settle for second place with Italian Andrea Dovizioso third. Briton Cal Crutchlow, Spain's Dani Pedrosa and Katsuyuki Nakasuga of Japan completed the top six. Spies told reporters: ""We tried to just be careful on the last lap as it had started to rain quite heavily. ""Casey took a couple more risks in the last couple of corners and had a bit more motor than me down the straight,"" he added. Stoner, who had already sealed his second world championship triumph prior to Sunday's race, said: ""It was the last lap of the last race of the year so I thought, 'Let's just go for it' -- and I got it. It was one of the hairiest races of my career."" The win ensured the Honda rider finished on 350 points, 90 points ahead of 2010 world champion Jorge Lorenzo, who was forced to miss the final race because of a finger injury. Dovizioso's third place ensured he claimed third in the overall standings with 228 points, ahead of Pedrosa on 219 points and Spies on 176. The race was the first since the tragic death of Marco Simoncelli in a crash in Malaysia a fortnight ago and, prior to racing, riders from the MotoGP, Moto2 and 125cc categories united to perform a lap of honor to remember the late Italian.","World champion Casey Stoner claims a thrilling Valencia MotoGP victory .

"Washington (CNN) -- An Idaho man accused of trying to assassinate President Barack Obama by shooting at the White House pleaded not guilty, as expected, in federal court Tuesday. Oscar Ortega-Hernandez will remain in custody until his trial, a date for which has not yet been scheduled. He appeared in a dark blue prison jumpsuit at his brief arraignment hearing before Magistrate Judge Deborah Robinson. He was indicted last week on 17 criminal counts. Prosecutors say Ortega-Hernandez fired a Romanian-made assault rifle out of the window of his car the evening of November 11. After allegedly sending a number of rounds toward the White House, he sped away toward a bridge leading to the Virginia suburbs, but crashed his vehicle and fled on foot, officials say. A court document says Ortega-Hernandez's fingerprints were found on ammunition magazines left in a 1998 Honda, but not on the weapon itself, which also was left in the car. Neither the president nor his family was at home at the time of the incident. Ortega-Hernandez said nothing at Tuesday's hearing, but appeared alert, nodding and smiling at the judge as the hearing concluded. He wore a heavy beard and was not in restraints. An FBI agent had testified at an earlier hearing that bullets found embedded in the White House residence came from Ortega-Hernandez's assault weapon. The 21-year-old man claimed after his arrest that he had been car-jacked by a man with a gun on the day of the crime, and said his assailant must have been responsible for the shooting, according to court filings. He also allegedly told the officers he never owned a gun, but the government cited two witnesses from Idaho confirming the rifle left in the car belonged to Ortega-Hernandez. A federal public defender representing Ortega-Hernandez had previously claimed inconsistent witness statements raised doubts about whether he was the shooter. Attorney David Bos cited one witness who said the shooter was driving a yellow van. Police had said Ortega-Hernandez was driving a dark-colored sedan. Bos did not object Tuesday when the magistrate ruled the defendant would continue to be held behind bars. Another hearing is scheduled for next month. Ortega-Hernandez was captured at a Pennsylvania motel days after the incident. He told police he hitchhiked and walked from the District of Columbia. Another federal judge previously ruled him competent to stand trial. Ortega-Hernandez has been interviewed at least once by a psychologist, and the doctor said he is able to understand the allegations against him and to aid in his defense. In court documents, prosecutors argue Ortega-Hernandez is dangerous and planned out his alleged crime over a period of months. If convicted of attempting to assassinate the president, Ortega-Hernandez would face a maximum sentence of life in prison.","Oscar Ortega-Hernandez will remain in custody until his trial .

"(EW.com) -- Oof. The Miami and Dallas audition rounds of ""The X Factor"" brought us a few solid acts -- and one stunning one -- and an utterly ridiculous amount of screentime dedicated to losers and fools. Have I been suckered into recapping ""America's Got Talent?"" Thankfully, Simon and company redeemed themselves by sticking a grey-sweatered dagger into that festering zit of a human being Xander Alexander (stage name) at the very end of the show. If you look up ""the worst"" in a dictionary, you will find this tattered seafoam creature, standing all alone with only his terrible attitude and a trash-basket Pepsi to keep him company. FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE. Books are timeless. I'd love to have seen more footage of promising ""yeses"" like Jeremiah Pagan (one of ""only like seven"" male sopranos in the world -- as if), or blink-and-you'd-miss-her Ma'at Bingham Shango. 31-year-old blonde-banged Hannah Jackson, I know you've just become able to fly out of your birdcage, but come back to me! Hog farmer Kyle Corr, sing to me some more! I almost always feel like a pig, so I promise it won't be weird. Stick with me, people! No dice. In lieu of more quality time spent with promising acts like girl group 2Squar'd, country singer/teacher Kendra Williams, and music instructor Brandon O'Hara, we got entire segments devoted to the likes of a defective Justin Bieber doll (if Justin Bieber dolls had been around in the '80s) and motormouth yawns like Ashley Nothing At All Like Pink and Ashley Ghost Hunter. (The ensuing inter-judge antics re: ghosts was pretty much the dumbest thing I've ever seen, and I've been watching ""Dancing With the Stars"" for 13 seasons.) The airtime devoted to yellow-bloused high school junior Caitlynne Curtis was a little easier to swallow, because it's been a while since we've seen Pauler put on her thinking cap and concoct a delicious scheme to trot up and hug someone. That poor girl's life would have been a lot worse from that moment forward if Paula hadn't done that. And she was sweet, you know? I would have hugged her myself. I cannot say the same about Dreamcatcher Crotch. But Nicole might. Despite an inspirational visit from local hero Gloria Estefan and a giant rainbow-colored beach ball, the talent in Miami was dreadful. ""Honest to God, nothing,"" complained Simon. ""I hope this is the worst session. I'm beginning to wonder why we came here."" Way to inspire people to keep watching, boss. And.... cue music! Meet Vanilla Ice Nick Voss, 21, who got fired from a job at the airport because all he wanted to do was dance. Silly airport. Those planes don't need to know where they're going! What Nick lacks in vocal talent and fully-grown-in eyebrows, he makes up for with fancy footwork and enthusiastic family members. Stevecrest Jones even did an overhead clap during Nick's rendition of Elvis Presley's ""Trouble."" A beaten-down L.A. Reid immediately gave in, ""because this is really the entertainment business."" Wise Paula suggested Nick lose the Michael Jackson choreography and focus on his vocals, and Simon declared ""Nick, I absolutely love you."" He had to. The episode was getting that bad. But Melanie Amaro, 18, redeemed it completely. FINALLY! We heard her entire amazing performance of Beyonce's ""Listen"" -- cutting her off would have seemed illegal. I got total Whitney Houston/Leona Lewis vibes from Melanie's voice alone. The fact that she has such a real, unassuming personality on top of the voice makes me want to go buy her entire album right now. It was so refreshing to see such a good-natured reaction to the crowd's overwhelming reception. There's nothing worse than an 18-year-old who knows she's the s---. The judges were nearly passing out with excitement. ""This is why I do this. People like you inspire me,"" said Nicole, who will never come close to singing as well as Melanie in her life. She's the best contestant we've seen by far. Dexter Haygood, 49, used to tour with Hall and Oates as part of a band called Xavion. I took the liberty of googling this up and now I'm kind of obsessed with him: . Here's where I finally felt the potential magic of ""The X Factor."" I mean, seriously? This guy? ""Why NOT this guy?"" seems to be the whole point of the show. It'll take some getting used to -- especially when I'm not instantly sold on a contestant's performance quality in present-day -- but I can legitimately see myself becoming invested in real people with real, living-out-of-their-car problems (who aren't, like, 17). First Dexter broke out a rote James Brown tribute act with ""Sexy Machine."" Ladies loved it; girls adored it, but Simon could see right through it and asked him to sing 15 seconds a cappella. During that entire commercial break I honestly wondered if maybe this guy would freeze up and either refuse for some creepy reason or not be able to think of just the right song. But he did! Nicole, who'd been switching up her dialects according to the occasion, called Dexter ""one of the funkiest cats I've seen up here."" Ooh. Two hours of actual funky cats auditioning for The X Factor probably would have flown by. Along with Melanie, Caitlyn Koch, 21, gave the most American Idol-esque audition. She was un-jaded, pretty, intrigued Simon before even singing (rugby coach!), and I loved the way she rearranged the Supremes. Nicole once again adjusted her critique to the personality in question and tossed Caitlyn a ""tough jock girl"" bone by awarding her ""a big ol' fat juicy delicious YES."" You guys, I have no idea why I'm only spotlighting Nicole's lines. I know they're the worst! See the full article at EW.com .

"(CNN) -- For years, all Hannah Pool knew was that her biological parents had died shortly after her birth. An Eritrean-born girl adopted as an infant by a British academic, Pool found herself spending her first years in Norway before landing in the UK at the age of seven. At times, she remembers, growing up in the northwest English city of Manchester as a Norwegian-speaking black girl with a white father was a source of confusion for people around her. ""When I was walking down the street holding my dad's hand, people would sometimes check that he wasn't sort of taking me, that he wasn't kidnapping me,"" says Pool, who today is a writer and journalist in the UK. ""There were lots of incidents like that which actually are just part of my upbringing, part of my DNA almost -- I'm used to having to explain myself, explain what I'm doing in the room, explain my relationship, whether it's with my dad or my brother or my sister,"" she adds. But a few years later, Pool's already unconventional life took an even more astonishing twist. Almost two decades after she left the Eritrean orphanage where she was adopted, Pool received a letter from the east African country informing her that her father was alive and well, living back home with her brothers and sister. The news left the then 19-year-old Pool reeling. ""It was a complete shock,"" she recalls. ""And it wasn't a creeping thing like 'maybe you have a cousin' or 'maybe you have an aunt' -- it was like BAM! 'you have a father,' BAM! 'here are your brothers and here's your sister,'"" she says. ""My head went into a spin, I didn't know what to do or how I was supposed to respond to this -- was I supposed to get on a plane and go to Eritrea, was I supposed to go back to all the people who I told my story to and tell them 'actually that story is not right, this story is right' and the whole sense of the story of me was just pulled from beneath me like a rug."" Shocked by the revelation, Pool initially decided to ignore it and continue her university studies in Physiology. But the thought she had a large family living in Eritrea was always with her ""as a kind of an itch."" So about 10 years later Pool felt that she had to get on a plane and travel to her birthplace. Meeting her father and the rest of her family for the first time face-to-face was ""incredibly emotional,"" says Pool. At the same time however, it was completely different to what she had expected. ""It was almost like an outer-body experience -- I watched myself go in the room, I was quite detached, I was surprised."" ""The thing that hit me the most was the language and I hadn't prepared for that -- I had prepared for this beautiful reunion where everybody looked the same as me and we all kind of connect immediately. ""And it wasn't like that and the main barrier at the time was the language."" Pool quickly understood that her European upbringing was marking her as different in her birthplace, in a similar way that her Eritrean background was singling her out in the UK. ""I thought I'm going to feel at home with everyone and initially that's how I felt -- I stepped off the plane and thought 'wow, I'm at home, this is where I belong,' but I realized very quickly that actually I do stand out from everyone."" Since then, Pool has visited Eritrea three times. She describes her relationship with her family there as a ""work in progress"" and has started learning Tigrinya -- the local language -- in order to help her have a ""normal family relationship."" A talented writer, Pool documented her journey to trace her family in a book entitled ""My Father's Daughter,"" a project that took about a year to complete. ""I wrote the book that I wish had been around when I was tracing myself,"" she says. ""There are a lot of books about adoption but usually it's from the point of view of the parents, there's very little from the point of view of the adoptees ... and I think it's important to get the debate they're in from their perspective."" An emotional memoir, Pool says the hardest part was not writing the book but going through the whole experience -- initially, she was afraid of how her fathers would respond to the book but in the end they were both very proud and supportive, she says. ""Both reactions were the best reactions I could possibly hope for,"" she says. An extract of the book was also published in Tigrinya in an Eritrean newspaper. ""That was amazing to see,"" says Pool. ""To see that my family were able to read an extract of my book on their own language -- that was a really proud moment for me, that was incredibly important for me, and they were really amazing about it."" Today, Pool proudly describes herself as British-Eritrean and says she would love to make the African country her home one day. ""I'm proud to be Eritrean and that's something that has come with time, with tracing and knowing where I'm from.""","Writer Hannah Pool was adopted as an infant from an orphanage in Eritrea and grew up in England .

"Yasuf, West Bank (CNN) -- Vandals burned a mosque in the West Bank on Friday in an attack a Palestinian official said reflected Israeli settler rage over a government moratorium on settlement construction. No one knows who set ablaze and vandalized the mosque -- located in the West Bank village of Yasuf. But the governor of Salfit district, Munir al-Abboushi, told CNN he believes Jewish settlers were responsible for the attack. ""The mosque was completely burned,"" al-Abboushi said. ""They burned the praying carpets and Quran holy books, and set the mosque completely on fire, they even burned the loudspeakers where the Imam preaches inside the mosque."" Al-Abboushi said the culprits had scrawled Hebrew graffiti at the entrance of the mosque that read ""price tag -- with regards from Effi."" ""Price tag"" is the expression radical Israeli settlers have used to denote reprisal attacks against Palestinians in response to moves by the Israeli government to evacuate illegal West Bank outposts. Israel's Defense Minister Ehud Barak called on the Israeli military, which occupies the West Bank, to find those responsible for the attack. ""This is an extremist action that is meant to harm any effort by the government to advance political processes for Israel's future,"" Barak said in a statement released by his office. Settler leader Dany Dayan -- chairman of the Yesha Council, a group of Jewish municipal councils from the West Bank -- told CNN, ""I hope that Israeli police will uncover the perpetrators whoever they are and will bring them to trial. This act is wrong and foolish. If this act was carried out by a Jew it fills me with great shame."" Al-Abboushi said later Friday morning, after word of the mosque attack had spread, residents of the village were prevented by the Israeli army from approaching the area which resulted in minor clashes with exchanges of rocks and tear gas between the residents and Israeli soldiers. Al-Abboushi expressed doubt that the attack would be investigated properly. ""What do the police and Israeli army do when they attack our holy mosques and houses? What do they do to the settlers? But when they attack us they do nothing."" Last month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a 10-month freeze on new settlement construction in the occupied West Bank. The move has been met with fierce opposition by the politically powerful settler movement and confrontations have erupted almost daily in the West Bank, with groups of settlers forcibly attempting to keep away government inspectors enforcing the ban.","Mosque in West Bank village of Yasuf set ablaze and vandalized .

"(CNN) -- BlackBerry customers slammed by last week's global outage are being offered free apps, not cash, as payback for their troubles. At least a dozen apps, which would cost about $100 on the BlackBerry App World site, will be made available in the next few weeks, according to a statement released Monday by BlackBerry maker Research In Motion. ""We truly appreciate and value our relationship with our customers,"" RIM Co-CEO Mike Lazaridis said in the statement. ""We've worked hard to earn their trust over the past 12 years, and we're committed to providing the high standard of reliability they expect, today and in the future."" An October 10 failure at a data center caused outages in Europe and elsewhere, RIm said. RIM throttled service to help address the outage, which spread over the next few days to Europe, the Middle East, India, Africa, Latin America and North America. Full service was restored on Thursday, according to the company. The free apps include: . * SIMS 3 . * Bejeweled . * N.O.V.A. * Texas Hold'em Poker 2 . * Bubble Bash 2 . * Photo Editor Ultimate - Ice Cold Apps . * DriveSafe.ly Pro . * Drive Safe.ly Enterprise . * Nobex Radioâ„¢ Premium . * Shazam Encore . * Vlingo Plus: Virtual Assistant . More apps will be added later, according to the statement. The first ones will become available on Wednesday and they'll stay free for the rest of the year. Business customers also will be offered a free month of technical support. The offer seemed to please at least some of BlackBerry's roughly 70 million customers. ""Only 1 simple word for this... AMAZING!!!"" wrote one visitor to a post on the BlackBery fan site, Crackberry. ""I wasn't expecting this at all, but it is welcome."" ""Trust restored RIM! ... ,"" wrote another. ""This also tells you RIM is very, very serious with surviving. No giving up for them."" But response was more measured among less-enthusiastic customers. ""What a useless 'compensation',"" wrote one commenter on the website for London's Guardian newspaper. ""What [if] somebody uses their device for communications (e.g. e-mail) rather than using loads of apps? The value in apps is totally worthless."" Many had been hoping to at least be reimbursed for the amount of time their service was out. By comparison, after Sony's PlayStation Network went down this spring, the company offered players free games, a weekend of free video rentals and a free month of PlayStation Plus, a premium subscription service offering exclusive titles, discounts and other perks.

"(CNN) -- Despite complaints by some owners about underwhelming battery life, the iPhone 4S scored ""very well"" in tests of its battery performance by Consumer Reports, which gave the device its official blessing Tuesday. Consumer Reports' laboratory tests also determined that Apple's new phone doesn't suffer the ""death grip"" reception problem that was found in its predecessor, the nearly identical-looking iPhone 4. That antenna flaw, which depleted signal strength when the user held the phone a certain way, led Consumer Reports to not recommend the iPhone 4. ""Overall, the new iPhone 4S scores higher in the ratings than the iPhone 4, thanks to such enhancements as an upgraded camera, a faster ""dual-core"" processor, and the addition of the intriguing Siri voice-activated feature ..."" wrote Mike Gikas in a post on Consumer Reports' site. Those upgrades were not enough, however, to let the iPhone 4S outscore the best new Android-based phones in Consumer Reports' ratings. Those top-rated models included the Samsung Galaxy S II phones, the Motorola Droid Bionic and several other phones that boast larger displays than the iPhone 4S and run on faster networks. Battery life has been an issue for the iPhone 4S since it went on sale October 14. According to Apple's official specs, the phone should have enough juice in its battery for up to eight hours of talk time, six hours of Internet surfing, 10 hours of video viewing and 200 hours on standby. (All of these activities are on a 3G connection; 2G and Wi-Fi produce different figures). But online forums soon filled with complaints from users saying their new iPhones weren't lasting even close to that long.

"(CNN) -- There is no reason to believe that Norway mass murder suspect Anders Behring Breivik is insane, District Court Judge Torkjel Nesheim said Monday. There is also no evidence he had accomplices in the bomb and gun rampage in which he is accused of killing 77 people this summer, the judge said. The judge ordered him held in custody for a further 12 weeks, with visits and correspondence controlled by the authorities for the first eight, and a ban on media for the first four. More than 500 people packed into a court in Oslo, Norway, to see the suspect's first public appearance, said Irene Ramm, head of press for the Oslo court. A woman whose daughter was killed in the massacre said she could not understand ""how a human being could do something like that."" ""That's why I had to be here today. I don't understand, so I had to see, had to be here,"" said the woman, who was identified only as ""Carina"" on Norway's TV2. ""He looked cold, completely cold,"" she said. He was not allowed to deliver a speech he had prepared, the station reported. Breivik said he did not recognize the authority of the court on the grounds that he opposes the multi-cultural society it is part of, TV2 said. He was stopped on several occasions when he started referring to himself as Commander of the Knights Templar, a title he used in his 1,500-page manifesto, the station reported. ""I interrupted Breivik during today's hearing because I only wanted to hear him about matters relating to today's hearing,"" Judge Nesheim said. ""This was not the main trial where he gets to explain himself. I did not want to give him the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for him to express his views."" Until now, the proceedings for Breivik have been held behind closed doors. The hearing was to determine whether to keep Breivik in jail until his trial in the spring. Prosecutors expect it to begin in March or April, the judge said. Survivors return to scene of island rampage . He is accused of killing dozens of people in a bomb attack in Oslo followed by a shooting rampage on nearby Utoya island. Eight people were killed in a bombing in Oslo; 69 young people were killed on Utoya island, in the deadliest attack in Norway since World War II. The young people were attending a Labour Party youth camp. Most of the 700 campers ranged in age from 16-22, with some as young as 13. Breivik has pleaded not guilty but admits carrying out the attacks, the judge said. ""The accused is still suspected on probable cause of criminal acts, as described in the charges. He has admitted the bombing in central Oslo and also the shooting on Utoya. The investigation has also confirmed this,"" Nesheim said. He is described by authorities as a right-wing Christian extremist. The 1,500-page manifesto attributed to Breivik was posted on the Internet and is critical of Muslim immigration and European liberalism.","NEW: The judge cut him off because this was not the time to justify his actions, he says .

"(CNN) -- Muggles will have another opportunity to slip into Harry Potter's magical world at a new Wizarding World of Harry Potter theme park at Universal Studios Hollywood. Universal Parks CEO Tom Williams promises the planned Southern California attraction will be ""every bit as spectacular"" as the first Harry Potter park, which opened in 2010 at Universal Orlando in Florida. That successful Harry Potter theme park will be significantly expanded, Williams also announced Tuesday. Hogwarts Castle, which houses the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry featured in the ""Harry Potter"" series, will be the Hollywood park's centerpiece, as it is in Orlando. Details on the timing of the new park and expansion have not been released. The new California park is likely to bring millions of tourist dollars. ""It's a huge win for the Los Angeles tourism industry,"" said Mark Liberman, CEO of the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau, in a statement. The Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp. estimates the Harry Potter park will produce $147 million in spending in the county for every one million additional visitors to Universal Studios Hollywood.

"(CNN) -- A Grammy-nominated classical pianist who wears personalized trainers, Lang Lang is one-of-a-kind in the world of classical music. His expressive and flamboyant style has so far brought him more fans than critics. The 26-year-old has become a sensation in the music world, with a prodigious talent that catapulted him from a childhood in northeastern China to playing to a packed Carnegie Hall by the age of 21. His flamboyant playing style and bold image has divided critics, but also attracted millions -- who might normally be more into MTV than Mozart -- to classical music. Lang Lang's parents were instrumental in pushing him to be a world-famous artist. At the age of 9, Lang Lang gained a place at the Central Music Conservatory, moving with his father to Beijing, where he faced some of the toughest moments in his young life. ""The biggest challenge for me is that I was not living with my mom. This is really awful because... I've been always very close with my mom when I was a kid. Even till today, you know, we're still very close,"" he told CNN. Tough times were compounded when his teacher took a dislike to him. Far from encouraging the young pianist, she consistently told him he had no talent, and after six months kicked him out of the school. Being so far from his mother, he found little support at the time from his father, with whom Lang Lang admits to having a difficult relationship as a child. ""When I was a kid I didn't talk to my father so much. I didn't know who to talk to when I'm facing very challenging situations. And that was really driving me crazy,"" he said. He experienced a harrowing moment when, in a violent outburst, his father accused him of ruining his dream of Lang Lang becoming a great pianist, saying he was no good and should throw himself out of their tenement building. ""I don't want to become a pianist at that moment, I hate piano, I hate my father, I hate everything that brings me to being a pianist,"" he said. ""I never forgive [my father] for a long time, but it is like now I understand, you know he quit his job and he went to Beijing with me."" He also managed to forgive his former piano teacher, and had the satisfaction of performing a master class at his former school and collecting an honorary professorship in 2006. It took Lang Lang a long time to play the piano again in front of his father, but his love for playing returned. His talent and competitive spirit won him the International Tchaikovsky Competition for young musicians at just 13. ""I only knew that competition is the only way to become famous as a Chinese person growing up in China. That's the education you get, competitions,"" he said. It brought him wider attention and, at the age of 14, a move to Philadelphia to study at the Curtis Institute of Music. His big break came when he was 17, appearing with the Chicago Symphony as a last-minute replacement. Just four years later, his solo recital at Carnegie Hall was sold out. Since then, the 26-year-old has played with some of the world's most esteemed orchestras and conductors -- Daniel Barenboim described his playing style as ""like a cat with 11 fingers"" -- and his youth, rich talent and flamboyant style has attracted a new audience to classical music. Appearing at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympic Games was a highlight among notable achievements. ""It was really incredible when you're playing in the middle of the stage; it feels like you're playing in the middle of the universe. You do the Olympic Games in the city which has most of the feeling for you, everything: disappointment, victory, tragic moments, really sad moment, but happy moment, and satisfied. It's a city that for me has everything and that what made me extremely emotional,"" he said. Wearing his heart on his sleeve, Lang Lang's performances also reflect his expressive nature. However, not all the reviewers and critics have warmed to his style or image. Some have nicknamed him ""Bang Bang,"" while American pianist Earl Wild dismissed Lang Lang as the ""J.Lo of the piano"" in an article in the New Yorker. While admitting he has created something of a brand of himself, Lang Lang is happy that he gains more plaudits from his contemporaries than negative reviews, and that he's able to help inspire others to take up music. An estimated 40 million children in China are learning the piano because of the ""Lang Lang effect."" While performing around 130 concerts a year, he also manages to find time in his packed schedule to be a UNICEF ambassador and work with the Montblanc Cultural Foundation. ""You need to be putting all the efforts into something you think is a priority. What I believe, this charity work is my priority... I would like to give back to the world something that I get from other people,"" he said.","The 26-year-old Chinese pianist has brought a new audience to classical music .

"(CNN) -- Need more evidence that Facebook's real-name-only policy has its flaws? Well, here you go: . A few days ago, Facebook allegedly kicked famous author Salman Rushdie off of its social network, and then asked him to change his posted name to Ahmed if he wanted to return. Rushdie -- known for his outspokenness -- went on a rant about the incident on Twitter, where he has more than 100,000 followers. Facebook eventually ""buckled,"" he wrote Monday. Here's a play-by-play of what happened, according to Rushdie's Twitter feed, which I condensed: . ""Amazing. 2 days ago FB deactivated my page saying they didn't believe I was me. I had to send a photo of my passport page,"" he wrote. ""Then they said yes, I was me, but insisted I use the name Ahmed which appears before Salman on my passport and which I have never used. ""Now they have reactivated my FB page as 'Ahmed Rushdie,' in spite of the world knowing me as Salman. Morons. @MarkZuckerbergF? Are you listening?"" Facebook did not respond to CNN's request for comment on the incident. On Tuesday, his Facebook page, with ""Salman"" as his first name, appeared to have been reactivated by the social network. Rushdie rose to international notoriety in the 1980s after his novel, ""The Satanic Verses,"" stirred protests throughout the Muslim world. The Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran issued a fatwa against Rushdie because of the book. His recent tussle raises issues with Facebook's policy of requiring people to use their real names when registering with the social network. People who don't use their real names are found to be out of compliance with Facebook's rules and can have their accounts deactivated. ""Facebook users provide their real names and information, and we need your help to keep it that way,"" Facebook's terms of service document says. Rushdie's situation shows how difficult it can be for people to prove who they are. He submitted his passport to Facebook, he wrote, and still had problems. Supporters of democratic protests in the Middle East and elsewhere have criticized Facebook and other social networks like Google+ for their real-name policies, saying they prevent people from organizing against authoritarian governments that could use a network like Facebook to crack down. If they could use pseudonyms, they would be safer, some say. ""There are myriad reasons why individuals may wish to use a name other than the one they were born with,"" Jillian York wrote on the Electronic Frontier Foundation's blog in July. ""They may be concerned about threats to their lives or livelihoods, or they may risk political or economic retribution. They may wish to prevent discrimination or they may use a name that's easier to pronounce or spell in a given culture."" Facebook always has maintained its position as an ""identity network."" A core philosophy of the site is that people should be themselves -- and should be accountable for their posts with their real names. Rushdie's case shows how tricky enforcement can be, though. ""This is the sort of thing that makes you wonder what real names policy is all about,"" Alexis Madrigal wrote on The Atlantic's website. He added: ""Seriously, what is the point of forcing Salman Rushdie to go by Ahmed Rushdie? How does this benefit the social Web?"" Rushdie taunted Facebook on Twitter before the site relented and reposted his page. ""Dear #Facebook, forcing me to change my FB name from Salman to Ahmed Rushdie is like forcing J. Edgar to become John Hoover,"" he wrote. ""Or, if F. Scott Fitzgerald was on #Facebook, would they force him to be Francis Fitzgerald? What about F. Murray Abraham?"" He later declared his win over the social network: . ""Victory! #Facebook has buckled! I'm Salman Rushdie again. I feel SO much better. An identity crisis at my age is no fun. Thank you Twitter!""","Author Salman Rushdie takes to Twitter to protest Facebook .

"London (CNN) -- There are few historical figures that can compete with Leonardo da Vinci's celebrity. This, despite what little we actually know about him. Other than the complex and often mysterious works of art and writings that are his legacy, what's left today amounts to a few basic facts, and anecdotes told by 16th-century art historian Giorgio Vasari. And yet, nearly 500 years after his death, da Vinci continues to fascinate, standing in popular culture as a totem of the supernaturally gifted individual. An exhibition, which opened in London this week, includes nine of da Vinci's 15 surviving paintings -- the first time so many of his paintings have been shown off together -- with an estimated insurance value of $2 billion. ""The big cultural figures like Dante and Shakespeare and Goethe and Einstein, they all have their cults and their 'loonies' as I call them -- but Leonardo is in a league of his own,"" he said. The quintessential Renaissance man who was brilliant in the fields of both science and art, da Vinci is widely regarded as a genius. ""He really was a polymath,"" said art historian Richard Stemp. ""He worked on everything -- he studied anatomy, he studied the natural world, he saw himself as a painter-philosopher really,"" he continued. Da Vinci was born in 1452, the illegitimate son of a Florentine landlord and notary, on his father's estate in Vinci. He was apprenticed at the workshop of Florentine artist Andrea del Verrocchio when he was just a teenager. In 1482, he entered into service of the Duke of Milan as an official painter and engineer and remained there for 17 years, during which time he created such masterpieces as the first version of ""The Virgin of the Rocks"" and the ""Last Supper."" It was also in this period that he turned to scientific studies. ""In his mid-30s, he starts to diversify and towards the end of his life he would have seen himself essentially as a scientist who also did a bit of painting on the side,"" said Martin Clayton, Senior Curator of Prints and Drawings at the Royal Collection in the UK, which contains an extensive collection of drawings by da Vinci. Da Vinci's mechanical drawings included prototype designs for such modern contraptions as helicopters and tanks. But it was during his second stint in Florence, from 1500 to 1506, that he painted his masterwork, the ""Mona Lisa."" Though we are now so used to this image of the smiling noblewoman, the painting's ""startling originality,"" according to Clayton, is still visible today. ""There's simply nothing out there like it before, this sense of looking at an individual and yet taking the individual out of the context of her own life and presenting her as this mystical, idealized figure who stands outside of time,"" he said. Da Vinci spent his last years in France, serving as a painter, architect and engineer to the King of France, and died there in 1519. The ""Mona Lisa,"" which he brought with him to France, stayed. Today, the portrait -- with its notoriously enigmatic smile -- remains the star attraction at the Louvre Museum in Paris. The aura of mystery around the ""Mona Lisa"" and, indeed, the artist himself could be what draws people into the cult of Leonardo, according to Italian art historian Mina Gregori. ""Even he could not explain himself completely,"" she said, referring to the unfinished nature of many of his works. ""He continued to create question marks, he always created problems, he created the curiosity to know more,"" she continued. Perhaps our best clues to who da Vinci really was are to be found in his paintings, writings and drawings. But as with all art, his works are open to interpretation. ""On a religious level, I think he was a probing person -- he questions (things) a lot,"" said Monsignor Renato Bellini, a priest in Vinci, where Leonardo was born and baptized. However, according to art historian Pietro Marani, the idea that Leonardo was either a divine talent or a supernatural being detracts from what we are able to read in the works themselves. ""(We) no longer (have) an image of Leonardo that is all one piece -- a semi-God, a magician -- but a multi-faceted Leonardo, a contradictory Leonardo, who changes (his) ideas,"" he said. Many of the drawings featured in the ""Leonardo -- The Lost Painting"" are held in the Royal Collection: royalcollection.org.uk .","Few historical figures continue to enchant like Leonardo da Vinci .
Renaissance man considered mysterious and inscrutable .
Intitally a painter, towards end of life he became a scientist .
Works show a questing, never satisfied mind, according to art historians ."
"New York (CNN) -- A mother abducted her eight biological children from a New York foster care agency during an authorized visit, authorities announced Tuesday. Shanel Nadal, 28, fled with her seven sons and one daughter from the Queens facility on Monday afternoon, police said. The abducted boys are all apparently named after their biological father, Nephra Payne, 34. They are Nephra Payne, 11; Nephra Ceo Payne, 10; Nephra John Payne, 9; Nephra Shalee Payne, 6; Nephra Rahsul Payne, 6; Nephra Umeek Payne, 5; and Nephra Yahmen Payne, 4. The lone girl was identified as Nefertiti Payne, 11 months. The New York Police Department said Nadal may be traveling with the children's biological father in a black 1996 Chevrolet Suburban with license plate number EXZ5896. Despite the one-day lag between the abduction and the announcement, New York City's Administration for Children's Services assured the public it had been investigating the incident since it occurred. ""ACS and our foster care agency began working with the NYPD immediately after the mother absconded with the children from a visit at the foster care agency yesterday,"" the ACS said in a statement. The statement made no mention of how Nadal escaped or why the children had been placed in foster care.

"(CNN) -- A small plane headed from New Jersey to suburban Atlanta crashed onto an interstate shortly after takeoff Tuesday, killing five people, authorities said. Two men, one woman, two children and a dog aboard the plane died in the crash in Morristown, New Jersey, just after 10 a.m. ET, said Robert Gretz, a senior air safety investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board. The plane, a six-seater Socata TBM700, was headed from Teterboro, New Jersey, to DeKalb-Peachtree Airport in suburban Atlanta when it crashed onto Interstate 287 about 14 minutes into the flight, Gretz said. The plane was at about 17,500 feet when ""there was some discussion between the pilot and the controller of locations of icing conditions,"" he said. He told reporters Monday night the conversation seemed ""routine"" and was ""not a distress call."" Gretz said he did not know whether the conversation concerned a cloud that might contain ice; actual icing on the airplane; or whether the pilot was inquiring where ice might be or reporting it. ""I've heard this thirdhand. ... That's something I need to listen to the tapes to know,"" he said. Gretz said he was not aware of any icing conditions on the ground at Teterboro that would have required the plane to be deiced. However, he stressed that the investigation is in its infancy and it is too soon to speculate what might have caused the crash. ""It's too early to tell whether it was something mechanical or something the pilot did -- we just don't know,"" he said. Preliminary information is that the five were headed to Atlanta for a combination business-leisure trip, Gretz said. Authorities did not release the names of those who died, pending positive identification by the medical examiner and notification of relatives. But New York investment banking firm Greenhill & Co. reported that those on board were two of the firm's managing directors, Jeffrey Buckalew, 45, and Rakesh Chawla, 36; Buckalew's wife, Corinne, and their two children, Jackson and Meriwether. Ages for the children were not given. ""The plane belonged to Mr. Buckalew, an experienced pilot whose passion was flying,"" the company said in a statement. ""The firm is in deep mourning over the tragic and untimely death of two of its esteemed colleagues and members of Jeff's family."" No one on the ground was injured, although a pickup truck narrowly missed the plane, Gretz said. The debris field from the crash was spread over about a half-mile, with part of a wing and the plane's tail found in a tree in a residential area, he said. Witnesses reported the plane was in an ""uncontrolled spin"" before it crashed. A Federal Aviation Administration radar facility in New York lost radio contact with the plane, and also lost it on radar, FAA spokesman Jim Peters said. The crash site was about 30 miles southwest of the Teterboro airport, Peters said. Gretz said Monday evening he was not sure how long after the conversation regarding icing that the plane dropped off radar, saying investigators will be determining that. The plane struck the southbound lanes of I-287, continued through a wooded median and came to rest on the northbound lanes, New Jersey State Police Lt. Stephen Jones said. Most of the interstate was shut down after the crash, Jones said. One northbound lane and two southbound lanes were open as of Tuesday afternoon, but officials were ""still trying to recover both the pieces of the plane and the remains of the victims."" Gretz said Monday night the wreckage recovery was halted about 6 p.m. because of darkness and would resume after Tuesday's morning rush hour, at 9:30 a.m. The New Jersey Department of Transportation said motorists had two of three travel lanes in each direction available for Monday evening's rush hour.

"(CNN) -- Stratfor, a global intelligence company, has been hacked but it was unclear Monday whether the breach and apparent release of credit card information was the work of the activist hacking group Anonymous. A posting on the website Pastebin said that Stratfor subscriber data, including information on 4,000 credit cards and the company's ""private client"" list, had been released. The posting cited AntiSec, a Web-based collaboration with the activist hacking groups Anonymous and LulzSec. U.S.-based Stratfor, which provides independent analysis of international affairs and security threats and describes itself as a publisher of geopolitical analysis, sent an e-mail Sunday to subscribers. ""On December 24th an unauthorized party disclosed personally identifiable information and related credit card data of some of our members,"" it said. ""We have reason to believe that your personal and credit card data could have been included in the information that was illegally obtained and disclosed."" Allen Barr of Austin, Texas, told CNN he was victimized by the misuse of his private information that was hacked from the website before it was posted on websites on the 24th. A week ago, unauthorized charges totaling $700 were billed to his Visa debit card, he said. The total was charged in increments to a number of charities over the course of about 30 minutes, he said. But the company quickly identified the transactions as suspicious and called Barr's house, he said. In short order, he had canceled the card, but not before his credit union checking account had been debited, he said. Rectifying that required half a day spent filing police reports and affidavits, he said. ""Two days later, they said that they would credit back my funds, pending completion of the investigation,"" he added. Stratfor said the claim that the data included the firm's ""private clients"" was wrong. ""Contrary to this assertion the disclosure was merely a list of some of the members that have purchased our publications and does not comprise a list of individuals or entities that have a relationship with Stratfor beyond their purchase of our subscription-based publications,"" CEO George Friedman said in an e-mail to members. The firm provides intelligence reports to subscribers. A recent e-mail discussed political prospects for Iraq. The information-sharing website Pastebin posted a news release it said was from Anonymous that said the group had nothing to do with the cyberattack on Stratfor. ""Stratfor is an open-source intelligence agency, publishing daily reports on data collected from the open Internet,"" the posting said. ""Hackers claiming to be Anonymous have distorted this truth in order to further their hidden agenda, and some Anons have taken the bait."" ""The leaked client list represents subscribers to a daily publication which is the primary service of Stratfor,"" it continued. ""Stratfor analysts are widely considered to be extremely unbiased. Anonymous does not attack media sources."" Stratfor's Friedman said the company is working closely with law enforcement. ""Stratfor's relationship with its members and, in particular, the confidentiality of their subscriber information, are very important to Stratfor and me,"" he wrote on the firm's Facebook page. ""We have reason to believe that the names of our corporate subscribers have been posted on other web sites,"" the Austin, Texas, company said. ""We are diligently investigating the extent to which subscriber information may have been obtained."" Asked about the hacking, Pentagon spokesman George Little said Sunday that ""Initial indications suggest that there has been no impact"" to the Department of Defense grid. Stratfor's website was not functioning Monday. A banner read, ""Site is currently undergoing maintenance. Please check back soon."" Weekend online postings regarding the Stratfor situation mentioned Army Pfc. Bradley Manning, who served as an intelligence analyst in Iraq. He faces 22 charges related to the leak of nearly 750,000 U.S. military and State Department documents. Most of them ended up on the WikiLeaks website. ""While the rich and powerful are enjoying themselves with all their bourgeois gifts and lavish meals, our comrade Bradley Manning is not having that great of a time in federal custody,"" said a Pastebin posting. ""Instead of being heralded as a fighter for free information and government transparency, he is criminalized, marginalized, and incarcerated, threatened with life imprisonment.""

"(CNN) -- I was in Atlanta when I first learned of a controversy over an inscription marking the new Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial in Washington. The quote on one side of the granite ""Stone of Hope"" reads, ""I was a drum major for justice, peace and righteousness."" In an interview with The Washington Post, poet Maya Angelou argued that these were not King's exact words and that, out of context, they made a humble preacher look like ""an arrogant twit."" Angelou expressed no concern with 14 other quotations from King that appear on a 450-foot-long memorial behind his statue. By coincidence, this news found me as I began research for a book on the power of short writing. I've learned that we often use the shortest texts to express the most important messages, especially to honor and enshrine. Twitter did not invent short writing. From tattoos to gravestones to the base of monuments, we choose words with special care because we want them to last forever. In a short text, every word counts. But with concision can come the loss of context. The overwhelming impression of the new memorial derives, not from language, but from sculpture. Even small photos of the new statue make King look monumental. He stands 30 feet tall, strong and determined, arms folded, looking as if he just marched out of the huge block of stone behind him. Memorial to be dedicated Sunday . In the presence of such powerful imagery, why the argument over a single sentence? Angelou's concerns were echoed by other African-American scholars and leaders, who argued the 10 words on the monument base have been ripped from their original context and meaning. In a sermon at Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, just months before his death in 1968, King preached, ""Yes, if you want to say that I was a drum major, say that I was a drum major for justice. Say that I was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And all the other shallow things will not matter."" In context, the word ""if"" makes all the difference. Without that opening conditional clause, it does seem that King is embracing the role of drum major rather than acquiescing to it. I did not understand, until I visited Florida A&M University and other historically black colleges and universities, the importance of the drum major in African-American culture. The drum major is a white American icon, too, of course, flamboyant even by the strait-laced Midwestern standards of Meredith Wilson's ""The Music Man."" Translated by famous black college marching bands, as pictured in the 2002 film ""Drumline,"" flamboyance transforms itself into soulful spectacle. To get a feel for the presence and status of drum majors, check out YouTube videos of auditions for that honored position. In addition to musical and leadership skills, the drum major must be able to strut, dance, spin, prance and perform backbreaking bends and splits -- without missing a beat. At the Poynter Institute where I work, marble plaques in a central garden offer students inspirational sayings. Famous writing teacher Donald Murray quotes the Roman poet Horace: ""Nulla Dies Sine Linea,"" Latin for ""Never a Day Without a Line"" of writing. The engraver, not schooled in Latin, left out the word ""Sine"" (without), leaving us with dead-language gibberish that could be taken to mean the opposite of the original. ""Oh well,"" I said when I saw the mistake, ""at least it's not carved in stone."" When we use the phrase ""carved in stone,"" we denote something permanent, irreversible, unchangeable. But it ain't necessarily so. Ignoring my suggestion that we copy-edit the marble text with a magic marker, my boss ordered a corrected version of Murray's quote. Everything I've learned about the language of enshrinement suggests that the inscription on the King monument should be revised. It need not be changed right away or in a way that would embarrass those who chose the original. Any revision should grow from a desire to perfect for posterity a magisterial work that springs from the noblest intentions. I know of no written standards for historical inscriptions, but the unwritten ones could come down to these two: 1) Quotes from the dead should never be taken out of context; 2) Quotations should reveal the honored character in the proper light -- or a better light. The drum major quote fulfills neither of these standards. To restore most of the original context would require the addition of 12 short words: ""If you want to say that I was a drum major, say that. ..."" A tighter compromise could be ""If you say I was a drum major, say. ..."" At the very least, a single word added to the existing quote would restore a bit of King's intended meaning: ""Say I was a drum major for peace. ..."" Every writer I know has had an editor who, to save space, has cut a passage to the bone. Done well, the meaning can ring clearer with fewer words. Done poorly, something critical to the reader's understanding is left behind. The problem is serious enough when it occurs on paper or in pixels, even more serious when it's carved in stone. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roy Peter Clark.","Maya Angelou reportedly has objected to a quote inscribed on King momument .

"(CNN) -- The Catholic Church in Ireland is going high-tech in a bid to reverse a dramatic decline in the number of priests. An establishment viewed as a bastion of tradition is turning to a new app to encourage more ""applications."" The app, says the church, is ""designed to promote vocations to the priesthood."" It is being hailed as a ""world first"" by the church in Ireland. ""The app is an original approach to assist current and future generations seeking to investigate and find information on vocations to the diocesan priesthood in Ireland,"" a statement issued ahead of the launch said. The number of new recruits to the priesthood has fallen sharply in the recent decades -- and as Ireland has become engulfed in a series of child sex abuse scandals over the past few years. The situation led to a respected former Catholic bishop in Ireland to call for an end to clerical celibacy. Edward Daly, the retired bishop of Derry, said allowing clergymen to marry would ease many of the church's problems. Daly told CNN he was worried about the decreasing number of priests and the number of older priests. The issue ""needs to be addressed and addressed urgently,"" Daly said, adding he found it ""heartbreaking"" priests were forced to resign or prospective priests were unable to join the priesthood because of the celibacy rule. The new 'Vocations' app was designed by Father Paddy Rushe and developed by the company Magic Time Apps, based in Dublin. It is available to download for free from the Apple iPhone App Store, said the church. Some of the features of the app, according to the church, are: Connection to Twitter and Facebook; Social networking at the service of vocations; Contact details and statistics on the 26 dioceses of Ireland; Frequently asked questions to assist a person to discern his vocation; News feed running from the national vocations website; Novel and cursory 'tests' to enable the user to reflect on vocation potential. ""Future updates will include a ""prayer counter"" to allow people pledge a period of prayer for vocations and a picture gallery which will include some images from the life of a seminarian,"" the church statement said. The launch of the new app marks the official handover from Rushe as the National Coordinator for Diocesan Vocations to Father Willie Purcell and his team, said the church. The app is part of a campaign promoted on the church website -- http://www.vocations.ie -- and follows 'Priesthood Sunday,' which was on September 25. The website called it ""an opportunity to highlight and promote particularly the vocation to the priesthood."" A statement on the website stressed more priests are needed: ""The number of priests per Catholic has declined over the past 40 years. This makes it more difficult for individual parishioners to establish a close relationship with any one particular priest."" ""Also, priests are no longer the only ones who offer pastoral care to our people,"" the statement continued. ""Yet without a priest, no parish is able to be a Eucharistic community. It is important to reaffirm the importance of the priesthood of Jesus Christ and its central place in the life of our church.""","The app is a first by the Catholic Church in Ireland .
It's being billed as a 'world first""

"(CNN) -- Pop star David Cassidy filed suit on Wednesday against Sony, claiming he was not paid for his image on merchandise from the hit television show, ""The Partridge Family,"" in which he starred. ""For nearly 40 years, defendants have swindled Mr. Cassidy out of his rightful share of the profits from The Partridge Family, and when Mr. Cassidy has inquired as to the matter, have lied to him so as to continue to conceal their deception,"" said the lawsuit, filed on Wednesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court. ""Mr. Cassidy has reason to believe, and does reasonably believe, that defendants have been perpetrating a scam"" and ""will continue to go to any and all lengths necessary, no matter how despicable, to avoid upholding"" his contract, the suit said. Named as defendants are Sony Pictures Entertainment, and subsidiaries Screen Gems Inc. and CPT Holdings Inc. The suit, which alleges fraud and breach of contract, demands ""in excess of millions of dollars, in amount to be determined at trial."" A Sony spokeswoman said the company does not comment on matters involving litigation. In an interview with CNN, Cassidy, 61, said he simply wants what's owed to him. ""It's just a matter of being fair, and doing the right thing,"" Cassidy said. ""I have no other alternative if Sony is not going to be reasonable."" He told CNN that his former manager told him he has only been paid about $5,000 for merchandise. ""I'm going to let a jury decide if David Cassidy is entitled to his fair share,"" he told CNN. Under his 1971 contract with Screen Gems, Cassidy was supposed to get 15 percent of net merchandising revenues for the use of his image, voice or likeness, and no more than half of that for items in which that if other cast members appeared. ""Mr. Cassidy quickly became a teen idol,"" the suit, filed by attorneys Kenneth Linzer, Rachael Shinoskie and Elisha Weiner, states. ""At the height of the show's success, he received an average of 30,000 letters from fans a week; having the largest fan club in the world in its day, surpassing even Elvis Presley and The Beatles."" The suit said the show, which aired from 1970 to 1974, was one of the first -- if not the first -- to be merchandized on a worldwide scale with board games, magazines, coloring books, paperbacks, posters, pillow cases, toy guitars, dollars, lunch boxes, beach towels, pencil cases, comic books, children's' clothing, and music sales. ""All of which, it has been reported by knowledgeable news sources, generated nearly $500 million for defendants,"" the suit said. Despite promises in his 1971 contract to provide financial statements for merchandising, Sony has ""either never provided such accountings and reports, or provided such accountings and reports only begrudgingly, inconsistently, inaccurately and fraudulently."" In a letter sent to Sony in May, Cassidy's attorney Craig Marshall, requested a full accounting of the merchandise. ""We are formally requesting an accounting and payment for any and all sale, exploitation, or other use of Cassidy's name, likeness, voice or other exercise of such merchandising rights,"" states the letter to Gregory Boone, executive vice president of legal affairs for Sony Pictures Television. ""In that regard, we also request a prompt and full accounting and payment of proceeds for any merchandise that was sold, exploited or otherwise used subsequent to the rights period set forth in the agreement."" Boone responded in a letter that Sony ""could not (and so far as we know did not) enter into any new merchandising licenses"" using Cassidy's ""name, voice and likeness rights"" after the show went off the air. ""We have searched for copies of the merchandising net proceeds rendered to Mr. Cassidy in the 1970s, but have been unable to locate them,"" the letter said. ""However, we did find some correspondence...showing that Mr. Cassidy's representatives audited such statements. Therefore, they must have been rendered to him."" Any potential claims, the letter said, are invalid because the ""statutes of limitation"" had expired decades ago. Asked why he waited so long to raise the merchandising issue, Cassidy said he didn't have a copy of his contract until, after a string of moves and business managers, he found it in a box that he hadn't opened since the 1970s. Besides his claims that he was cheated out of merchandising revenues, he said new merchandise from the show has continued to be produced in the last 10 years. He said, since the merchandising rights reverted to him one year after the show went off the air and he was entitled to profits from the show, he was supposed to also get paid for any new merchandise. For example, Cassidy showed CNN a ""The Partridge Family"" toy bus and model kit with a 2001 copyright. The company that manufactured the toy, Playing Mantis Inc., has since been sold. But a spokeswoman for the new company confirmed that the toy was produced in 1998 and again in 2001 with Sony's permission. A toy hamster that sings ""I Think I Love You"" also has a 2001 copyright from Gemmy Industries Corp. Lio Chang, a company vice president, told CNN that Gemmy got permission to use music from a Sony subsidiary. Still another ""Partridge Family"" toy bus has a 2003 copyright from CPT Holdings, which is Columbia Pictures Television, a Sony subsidiary. A Sony spokeswoman had no comment when CNN asked about these recent copyrights. The only other cast member reached by CNN from ""The Partridge Family"" who said he received money from merchandising is Brian Forster, who replaced Jeremy Gelbwaks as Chris Partridge is the second season. Forster said he received about $1,100, after his mother demanded payment from the studio. The other cast members contacted by CNN said they either didn't have a merchandising clause in their contracts or do not remember getting paid. Cassidy's comments to CNN follow interviews earlier this year with cast members of ""Happy Days,"" who are suing CBS over the same issue. Actors Don Most, Anson Williams, Marion Ross and Erin Moran, as well as the widow of actor Tom Bosley, filed a $10 million suit in April, claiming CBS, which owns the show, failed to pay them for ""Happy Days"" merchandise, which is still being sold around the world. After the lawsuit was filed, CBS Corp. sent checks to the actors totaling $43,403. But Jon Pfeiffer, the actors' attorney, said he would not cash the checks while the case is pending because that would imply his clients agree with CBS that is all they are owed."" In a statement, CBS said it agreed the actors are owed money for the merchandise, but dispute the amount. In a court filing, the company said the actors are ""attempting to generate a lucrative litigation windfall by riddling their complaint with unsupported and overreaching causes of action"" for fraud and breach of good faith. CBS said this was ""all done in a transparent attempt to introduce the specter of punitive damages"" in the case. But the actors fired back in court papers, saying ""although defendants routinely rebrand their corporate images, they should not be permitted to rebrand the truth."" For Cassidy, he said the issue with ""The Partridge Family"" is the same -- where did all the merchandising money go? ""I'm asking for fairness, I'm asking to be treated with respect as opposed to, 'we don't owe you anything,'"" Cassidy said.","1970s pop icon David Cassidy filed a lawsuit Wednesday against Sony .

"(CNN) -- The NBA has canceled its preseason, and the first two weeks of the regular season are in jeopardy as team owners and players remain at odds over a new labor deal. ""By Monday, we will have no choice but to cancel the first two weeks of the season,"" NBA Commissioner David Stern said Tuesday. The cancellation of all 114 preseason games will mean a loss of about $200 million in revenue, he said. The NBA already had announced the cancellation of some preseason games. ""And we're looking down the barrel of losing regular-season games. There's an extraordinary hit coming to the owners and to the players,"" Stern said. The sometimes bitter labor struggle and lockout has stretched to three months. ""We can only say we are running out of time so many times,"" NBA Deputy Commissioner Adam Silver has said. NBA Players Association President Derek Fisher has acknowledged the stakes. ""We are aware of the calendar,"" he said this week. ""We know our backs are against the wall in terms of regular season games and what those consequences will be."" Last week, the NBA announced that it had postponed player training camps for the upcoming season and canceled some preseason games. Training camps were scheduled to open on October 3. Representatives from both sides have been meeting in hopes of hammering out a collective bargaining deal, but no significant progress has been announced. The NBA began a lockout of its players in early July. Stern has said that last season was not profitable for most of the league's 30 owners, who want cost-cutting help from players. The league lost as much as $300 million in the 2010-11 season, Stern has said. One of the battles has focused on the owners' rejection of the players union's call for an average $7 million player salary in the sixth year of a new labor deal. The current average salary is about $5 million. Other big issues include a fight over whether the NBA will strengthen its salary cap and a move by owners to get a bigger share of revenues. The last work stoppage occurred in 1998.","NEW: The first 2 weeks of the regular season are in jeopardy .

Investigators arrested his 22-year-old brother, she said. Halman played center field for the Seattle Mariners. Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig issued a statement expressing his condolences to the team. ""The loss of a talented 24-year-old young man like Greg, amid such tragic circumstances, is painful for all of us throughout the game,"" Selig said. Betra Dorrestijn, a spokeswoman for the Royal Baseball and Softball Union of the Netherlands, said Halman's family confirmed his death to the federation. ""We are shocked to hear that Gregory Halman has passed away,"" she said. ""It is tragic that he should die at such a young age."" Halman was a federation member when he played baseball as a teenager for an amateur team in his hometown of Haarlem, just outside Amsterdam, before going to the United States to play, Dorrestijn said. Halman made his Major League debut on September 23, 2010, and went on to play 44 games with the Seattle Mariners, Major League Baseball said. He finished the 2011 season with 20 hits, including two home runs, in 87 plate appearances, according to figures from Major League Baseball. ""I only knew Greg for a brief time, but I feel lucky that I had the chance to get to know him,"" Mariners Manager Eric Wedge said in a statement. ""He was a fine young man with a bright future.

"(PEOPLE.com) -- Giuliana Rancic said Monday that she has breast cancer, having discovered a tumor during a mammogram while undergoing another round of in-vitro fertilization in an effort to get pregnant. The E! News and Style Network host, 36, made the emotional announcement on NBC's ""Today"" show. She will undergo surgery this week and then have six weeks of radiation therapy. The cancer has been detected early, and the prognosis is good, she said. Rancic was going to wait until 40 to have a mammogram, but her IVF doctor suggested she have one now. She says she will still push to have a baby, following one IVF attempt that ended in a miscarriage and a second that didn't work. ""I still want this baby ... because this baby has saved my life,"" she said. ""I truly feel God was looking out after me ... If I had gotten pregnant later down the line, I could have been a lot sicker."" She also says her husband, Bill Rancic, has been ""unbelievable. The best thing about Bill is, he lets me cry when I want to cry.""

"(CNN) -- The Higher Security Council, in charge of ""organizing and securing Tripoli,"" announced Thursday that courts in the city will start operating next week. ""People must realize that the country's system has been destroyed and is being rebuilt now,"" said Lt. Colonel Mustapha Nooh, head of the council. He said detained prisoners will be directed toward the general prosecutor for ""clearer"" due process. The change was announced the same day a report from Amnesty International detailed claims of abuse against prisoners by anti-Gadhafi forces. For example, last August, fighters in a house in Abu Salim tied the hands of two brothers from the southern city of Sabha and beat them while taking them into custody, according to the report. ""They beat us several times using their rifles,"" the elder brother told the human rights group. ""They also whipped us. When they transferred us to Mitiga (the airport detention facility), they forced us to walk on our knees to the vehicles while they insulted and beat us. They accused us of being mercenaries."" The report says that militia members detained as many as 2,500 suspected Gadhafi loyalists in the Tripoli area and that, in nearly every case, people were arrested without warrants and far from the oversight of the Ministry of Justice. Diana Eltahawy, Amnesty's North Africa researcher, told CNN on Thursday that the arrests were more like abductions -- people taken from their homes by unidentified captors carrying out raids on suspected Gadhafi loyalists. ""We spoke to several guards,"" said Eltahawy, who added she heard screams from detainees being whipped as she waited in one of the facilities. ""They didn't see a problem to beat detainees to extract information. To them it was normal."" It was the way things had been done for the four decades of Gadhafi's iron-fisted rule. After visiting 11 facilities and interviewing 300 detainees, some of them women and children, the Amnesty team found that culture very much in place as Tripoli was falling. A 17-year-old boy from Chad, accused of rape and of being a mercenary, told Amnesty that he was taken from his home in August by armed men who held him in a school where they punched him and beat him with sticks, belts, rifles and rubber cables. ""The beatings were so severe that I ended up telling them what they wanted to hear,"" he said. ""I told them I raped women and killed Libyans."" In issuing the report, Amnesty International called on Libya's National Transitional Council to put end such human rights violations. Many of the militias are working outside the law, Eltahawy said. ""What the national council needs to do from the very beginning is to send a strong signal that this behavior will not be tolerated,"" she said. Nooh acknowledged incidents of abuse but said they were isolated. He said members of his security staff were present during the Amnesty International interviews and that they have nothing to hide. He denied the scope and gravity of the abuses depicted in the Amnesty International report. ""Yes, there have been infringements related to beating detainees under arrest, but I would not call it torture,"" Nooh said. ""These are isolated incidents caused by rebels who were emotional due to the fighting and losing friends or relatives in the war, but it's no organized beatings or designed to extract confessions."" Human Rights Watch has also documented accounts of detainee abuse that amounts to torture. The global monitor issued a report earlier this month that urged Libya to ensure that the rule of law prevails as it forges ahead in building a new nation. Those interviewed told Human Rights Watch that they were beaten and given electric shocks. Some showed their scars as proof of their claims. One man wept openly in telling his story of abuse. A detainee identified as Ahmed said this: . ""They took an electric cable and started hitting me with it. They didn't use electricity, but they said that if I didn't talk, they would. ... They hit me with a butt of the Kalashnikov. They kicked me in the face and in the chest. One scratched me with the knife (bayonet) of the Kalashnikov."" Human Rights Watch said none of the detainees has ever faced a judge. ""After all that Libyans suffered in Moammar Gadhafi's jails, it's disheartening that some of the new authorities are subjecting detainees to arbitrary arrest and beatings today,"" said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. As a state party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the U.N. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Libya has an obligation to prevent torture and abuse, Amnesty International said. Libyan authorities, the group said, cannot allow such abuses to go on simply because the nation is in a transitional phase. If they do, said the human rights activists, Libya's new leadership will be no better than the old. Nooh also spoke Thursday against foreign security companies coming into Libya. Noting that ""there is no clear visa system for entry and the borders are not fully organized,"" he said that nine foreign security companies, some of them American, have established bases in Libya without permission. ""We have compiled data on them and informed the United Nations,"" Nooh said. ""The Libyan people (do) not want foreign security companies.""

"London (CNN) -- Violence has returned to the streets of Cairo -- this time in fresh confrontations between army forces and pro-Coptic Christian protesters. Accounts of the casualties vary but an Egyptian health ministry spokesman told CNN that 25 people had been killed and more than 272 injured during the weekend protests that were sparked by the burning of a Coptic Christian church in southern Egypt. There has been long-standing tension between Egypt's Coptic Christians and Muslims but CNN's Ben Wedeman in Cairo says that since this year's revolution that removed the former President Hosni Mubarak there have been more of these clashes. In the aftermath of the latest violence, Egypt's Prime Minister Essam Sharaf has vowed to ban all discrimination based on religion, language, gender or ethnicity. But why has the violence erupted after a revolution which promises to deliver fresh democratic elections, who are the Coptic Christians and what will the new measures achieve? CNN examines the background. After a revolution that brought change, do people have renewed confidence in being able to protest? Are they seeing an opportunity to make their voices heard ahead of elections? Ben Wedeman reports that at least among activists, there is a growing concern that any form of political activity, particularly demonstrations, that target the regime will be met by the kind of force used Sunday evening . One Coptic man told our correspondent that the military is more than happy to allow ""millions of Muslim fundamentalists to occupy Tahrir Square every Friday, and cooperate with them in doing so, but when it comes to people who criticize -- Copts, Muslims, secular people -- the military, they use their guns."" He says it's also important to keep in mind that one thing that occupies the minds of many Egyptians is that since the revolution the economy has gone from bad to worse. Tourists are scarce, foreign investment is drying up. One Egyptian told him: ""If people don't get back to work within the next five months, there could be famine and chaos."" Why did the military react with such a heavy hand, given its experiences in the revolution? Wedeman says it is a good question to which no one really has an answer, but offers this analysis: . During the revolution the army stood on the sidelines, and were cheered by the masses . The military, however, adds Wedeman, is not an organization which by its nature is well adapted to dealing with civil disturbances, and that has been clear for some time. They often stand by when the situation goes out of control -- something they did during the revolution when regime thugs tried to attack the protesters in Tahrir Square. There are concerns among some that with the spread of Islamic fundamentalism within Egyptian society as a whole that religious hardliners have gained a foothold in the officer corps, and that is reflected in the way they dealt with the Coptic protesters. One sometimes hears Muslims describe Christians as ""kufar"" -- infidel -- even though the traditional interpretation of Islam was that Christians and Jews are not ""kufar"" but rather ""Ahl al-Kitab"" -- the people of the book -- meaning that they are followers of books holy in the Abrahamic tradition. Who are the Coptic Christians? The Coptic Christians make up somewhere between 8 and 11 % of the 80 million Egyptians, most of whom are Sunni Muslims. They are not ethnically distinct. They base their theology on the teachings of the Apostle Mark, who introduced Christianity to Egypt, according to St. Takla Church in Alexandria, the capital of Coptic Christianity. Copts split from other Christians in the 5th century over the definition of the divinity of Jesus Christ. The Copts have been a target of violence in the past but there have been dozens of casualties this year. The New Year's Day bombing of a Coptic church in Alexandria left 23 people dead, and during sectarian clashes in Cairo on May 7 at least 12 people were killed. The most recent protests follow the September 30 burning of the Mar Girgis church in Edfu, a city in Aswan governorate in southern Egypt. Sectarian violence in Egypt is nothing new. Maha Azzam, Associate Fellow of the Middle East and North African Program at the Chatham House think tank in London, says the sources of tension have focused on religious conversions, attacks on places of worship and Coptic resentment that they are not being given licenses to build new churches . The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, an independent bipartisan federal agency, earlier this year added Egypt to a list of countries named as the worst violators of religious freedom. The Coptic church . Egypt's Coptic Christians and the crisis . Why have we seen an upsurge in sectarian violence this year? The reasons are not clear but Azzam points to two possibilities . 1) Attempts by those opposed to democratic changes put in place by the revolution earlier this year to stir up trouble. 2) Efforts by extreme Islamist groups to resist attempts by the Copts to establish more churches in the new democratic era. However, CNN's Ben Wedeman reports that the Muslim community has sent condolences to the Copts in response to the weekend deaths - and there are similar sentiments being expressed on Twitter with many calling for greater religious tolerance. So what are the concerns now? Copts are increasingly worried about their future in Egypt. Wedeman says many are worried that the de-facto rulers of Egypt, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), have concluded an under-the-table alliance with the Muslim Brotherhood and the hard-line conservative Salafi movement as a means to cement their hold on power. ""And this perceived alliance shuts out not just Christians, but also secular activists, liberals and others who are worried about the excessive power of those who use religion as a cover for their political ambitions,"" he said. Will the new measures to ban intolerance make a difference? Again, our correspondent says there is a lot of skepticism about the willingness of the military or the government to make good on these promises. He said similar promises were made in May when there was an outbreak of sectarian violence in Cairo that left more than 10 people dead. The government formed a National Justice Committee, composed of Muslim, Coptic representatives and military and government officials. Several members of the National Justice Committee have resigned or suspended their membership in protest after Sunday's violence and the army's actions. Wedeman says there have been growing calls from prominent politicians for the resignation of the prime minister who is seen as weak and ineffectual at addressing sectarian issues. What does this mean for the Egyptian government? Azzam says the weekend violence presents a serious challenge for Egypt in this transitional period. But she says the reaction of the armed forces and overwhelming use of force reflects a military that is unable to deal with dissent. ""Questions have to be asked about who gave the orders and the clumsy way they dealt with protesters,"" she said. Both Azzam and Wedeman say the government reaction looked similar to that of the old regime, while the military response has also attracted criticism from Muslims. In May this year, Michael Wahid Hanna, a fellow and program officer at The Century Foundation, wrote on the CNN website that much should be expected of Egypt's newly-empowered Muslim Brotherhood. ""Repressed and officially banned under Mubarak, the Brotherhood is now the most coherent opposition force in the country and is calling for the emphasis of Islam in Egypt's politics,"" he said. So will the process of change be affected? Moves towards a democratically-elected Egyptian government have been difficult. The U.S. has been trying to encourage the government to lift the state of emergency, and a coalition of 60 political groups previously threatened to boycott parliamentary elections set to start in November unless their demands were met. An agreement reached Saturday included a promise to consider abolishing military tribunals and plans to draft a document to guide the creation of a new constitution. But some activists said the agreement fails to meet all the demands of the popular uprising. ""There are very serious challenges - both sectarian and economic - but I think we are heading for greater democratization,"" said Azzam. ""It's very hard to reverse that. I think it's going to be very hard to delay elections.""","Coptic Christians make up between 8 -11% of the population, most of whom are Sunni Muslims .

"(EW.com) -- Although it didn't set a franchise record, ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn -- Part 1"" had one of the best openings in box-office history by debuting to $139.5 million, according to studio estimates. That's the fifth-best opening weekend ever, behind ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 2,"" ""The Dark Knight,"" ""Spider-Man 3,"" and ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon,"" which held on to the franchise record. ""New Moon"" debuted to a slightly better $142.8 million on the same November weekend two years ago. What's interesting is how closely ""Breaking Dawn"" followed ""New Moon's"" trajectory. ""New Moon"" grossed $72.7 million its first day, and then dropped 42 percent on Saturday and 34 percent on Sunday. By comparison, ""Breaking Dawn"" earned $72 million on Friday (the third-best opening day ever), and then fell 44 percent on Saturday and a projected 34 percent today. ""New Moon"" ultimately finished its domestic run with $296.6 million, and it's too early to tell whether ""Breaking Dawn"" will wind up a bit short of that final figure. Even if it does, Summit Entertainment won't be complaining about grossing nearly $300 million from the fourth movie of its franchise. And, of course, the domestic box office is only a part of the equation here. ""Breaking Dawn"" took in $144 million from 54 foreign territories this week, pushing its worldwide debut to a staggering $283.5 million. Summit reports that ""Breaking Dawn"" attracted a crowd that was, unsurprisingly, 80 percent female. What is surprising is that the PG-13 movie's audience wasn't as young as you'd think, with 60 percent over the age of 21. According to CinemaScore, 30 percent of the film's audience was under 18, but an even larger 42 percent was between the ages of 18 and 34. The popular conception is that The ""Twilight Saga"" is merely a teenage phenomenon, but these figures seem to prove otherwise. The $110 million movie received a good-but-not-great B+ rating from CinemaScore graders. In second place was Warner Bros.' 3-D animated sequel ""Happy Feet Two,"" which fell far short of expectations by dancing to only $22 million. The 2006 original, an Oscar winner for best animated feature, opened to $41.5 million -- and that was without the benefit of 3-D surcharges. ""Happy Feet Two"" was saddled with mediocre reviews, which might have discouraged some parents. Furthermore, five years could have been too long of a wait, especially for a sequel that appeared very similar to its predecessor. The original ""Happy Feet"" was released a year after March of the Penguins, when the Antarctic birds were having a moment in the cultural zeitgeist. That moment has clearly passed. The $135 million sequel earned a B+ rating from CinemaScore moviegoers, and 3-D theaters accounted for 50 percent of its weekend tally. The rest of the top five consisted of holdovers. The 3-D action flick ""Immortals"" dropped a harsh 62 percent for $12.3 million -- a second-weekend decline that was larger than both ""300"" (54 percent) and ""Clash of the Titans"" (57 percent). ""Jack and Jill"" witnessed a typical Adam Sandler fall of 52 percent for $12 million. And even though ""Happy Feet Two"" underperformed, ""Puss in Boots"" lost much of its family audience. The animated adventure dropped 57 percent for $10.7 million in its fourth weekend. In limited release, Alexander Payne's ""The Descendants,"" starring George Clooney, debuted to $1.2 million from 29 theaters -- enough for a tenth-place finish. The Oscar hopeful raked in an impressive $42,150 per location. Only ""Midnight in Paris,"" ""The Tree of Life,"" and ""Jane Eyre"" opened to stronger per-theater averages this year, and those movies started out on far fewer screens than ""The Descendants."" 1.

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- Robert Sanabria thought he would never see his big brother again. Robert was 15 when his brother, Edwin, left home at age 18. Born prematurely with only one functioning lung, Edwin spent his school years in special education classes, Robert said. He remembered his brother as soft-spoken, humble and kindhearted. ""When he left, he just took off,"" Robert told CNN by phone last Saturday. ""He was in love and ran away."" He last saw his brother in 1999. Neighbors and friends would tell Robert they thought they spotted Edwin around the city. ""It was like a bigfoot sighting,"" he said. ""Every time they said they saw him it went nowhere. The information led to a dead end."" Robert, 29, is a sergeant in the U.S. Army who lives with his wife outside Fort Bragg, North Carolina. All his years of military training and combat experience couldn't prepare him for what happened a few weeks ago. In mid-October, Robert received a call from his father, who told him police might have found Edwin locked in a dank Philadelphia basement with three other people. The pitch-black, 15-by-6-foot space discovered by the owner of the apartment building houses what police described as an abandoned boiler room, where the overwhelming stench of urine and feces still hung in the chamber two days after the discovery. Hours after his father's phone call, Robert made the nine-hour drive north to see if his long-lost brother was among the four victims. ""It made me nauseous. I was anxious. It was eating me up. I was crying on the way up there. If that gut feeling wasn't there, I wouldn't have gone,"" he said. ""We still didn't know if it was him, but there was only one way to find out."" Media reports identified Edwin Sanabria and Tamara Breeden as two of the victims. ""When I saw their names together, I knew it was my brother and his girlfriend. I couldn't believe it,"" Robert said. When Edwin left his Philadelphia home at 18, he told Robert he was staying with his girlfriend, Tamara, and her family, Robert said. ""They were in love. We were hoping that they were being taken care of,"" Robert said. After Edwin lost contact with his family, the Sanabrias asked for help in tracking him down from Philadelphia police and the local Social Security Administration office, which distributed disability benefits checks to Edwin. Their efforts were in vain. Edwin was an adult who left home on his own, so the police couldn't intervene. Access to Edwin's personal information from the Social Security Administration wasn't possible because it was considered a violation of his privacy, Robert said. It would take more than a decade for the Sanabrias to discover Edwin's fate. Robert said it was Breeden who introduced Edwin to one of his alleged captors, and he believes his brother's abuse could have started soon after Edwin left home. Police have not said how long Edwin may have been captive. Last month in Philadelphia, Robert and his father met with police and were sent to a health care facility where the captives were being evaluated. Expecting a hug and ceremonious reunion, Robert was greeted with a nonchalant head nod. Exhausted and feeling defeated, he began to cry, fearing his brother no longer even recognized him, he said. But as if on cue, Edwin stood up and walked over to the stunned men and said, ""Pop,"" to his father. Robert, a self-described tough guy who completed two tours in Iraq, wept uncontrollably. ""I am bawling. I realized how much I missed him, how much I loved him,"" he said. ""He looked really, really skinny and really malnourished."" Then Edwin started looking closer at his crying brother and said, ""Robert?"" He quickly flashed Edwin his military ID. Edwin held it inches from his face, almost straining to read it, Robert said. Edwin started talking, and then wrapped his lanky arms around his baby brother. ""He gave me a long hug,"" Robert said. ""Then he said, 'You know what I want? I want a cheesesteak.' So I went and got him one as fast as I could."" Police arrested Linda Ann Weston, 51, Gregory Thomas, 47, Eddie Wright, 49, and Weston's daughter, Jean McIntosh, 32, for allegedly imprisoning four mentally disabled adults in the basement boiler room. They face a host of charges including criminal conspiracy, aggravated assault, kidnapping, criminal trespass, unlawful restraint and false imprisonment. Weston, Wright and McIntosh face additional charges -- including aggravated assault, simple assault, kidnapping and reckless endangerment -- in connection with the alleged abuse of Weston's niece, Beatrice Weston, authorities said. A hearing for the new charges is set for November 15. All four suspects in the case are scheduled to appear in court on December 19. Weston had identification documents for about 50 people with her when she was arrested, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said. Those documents included Social Security cards and court documents giving power of attorney. Police said they were investigating whether the victims' Social Security checks had been stolen, as well as several other leads. In addition to the four captives found in the basement, authorities have located 10 other potential victims, including six children, Ramsey said. Police believe two of the six children placed in protective custody -- ages 2 and 5 -- are the children of Tamara Breeden. DNA testing is being conducted to confirm paternity, but the Sanabrias believe Edwin is the father. Edwin is slowly opening up about his ordeal, Robert said. Edwin never fled because he loved Breeden and he was never left alone, he said. He also said he was mistreated by Weston's teenage sons. Edwin said he would often fight back and share his food with the others while he was with Weston, Robert said. Edwin said he would also intercept blows intended for Breeden. Edwin also recalled separate incidents in which he was sliced with a knife and shot with a BB gun, Robert said. Edwin told his brother that one of the captives, Herbert Knowles, had seizures in the basement, so he gave him water and placed a cold rag on his head, Robert said. He said the water came from the same bucket they used as a toilet and to bathe. Worried about the physical and emotional abuse his brother endured, Robert said he plans to have Edwin come live with him, and vows to protect him to the end. ""The first thing I wanted to tell him was that this was not his fault, that everybody gets tricked,"" he said. ""It's disturbing. It still messes with me. They (the defendants) all deserve life in prison.""","U.S. Army Sgt. Robert Sanabria hadn't seen his brother, Edwin, since 1999 .

"(CNN) -- A fire at a house in Connecticut early Christmas morning killed two adults and three children, fire officials said. Two other people made it out alive. ""It is a terrible, terrible day for the city of Stamford,"" said Mayor Michael Pavia, briefing reporters about the ""horrible tragedy."" ""There probably has not been a worse Christmas Day in the city of Stamford,"" he said. Multiple calls came in shortly before 5 a.m., fire officials said. The first firefighters on the scene attempted rescues within the home, but ""were pushed back by intense flame and heat,"" said Acting Fire Chief Antonio Conte. The cause remains under investigation. Due to the condition of the building, it will be days before investigators can determine what happened, Conte said. Seven people lived in the house, Conte said. He had no immediate information on their identities or the conditions of the two who came out alive and were taken to the hospital. The home is in Stamford's Shippan Point neighborhood, just in from the Long Island Sound, fire officials said. CNN's Josh Levs contributed to this report.","NEW: 2 people made it out alive, officials say .

"(CNN) -- Hey, big spender. New Year's Eve is coming up fast, but there's still time to think about an unforgettable getaway to usher in 2012. Maybe this is the year for the trip of a lifetime or perhaps you're looking to be somewhere out of the ordinary when the clock strikes midnight. If so, here are six luxurious itineraries that require deep pockets, but will set the tone for an amazing New Year. Can't make it this time around? Use the list as inspiration for New Year's Eves to come. Secluded Hawaii . Celebrate in your own (almost) private paradise, far away from any crowd. It takes a 45-minute ferry ride from Maui to get to tiny Lana'i, a former pineapple plantation that has earned the nickname ""Hawaii's Most Enticing Island."" You might not be able to rent the whole place for yourself, like Microsoft founder Bill Gates did for his wedding, but you can sip champagne at midnight at the Four Seasons Lana'i at Manele Bay resort. ""It would be a very exclusive, quiet New Year's celebration,"" said Janice Hough, an agent with All Horizons Travel in Los Altos, California. ""The service is incredible. It's very much a get-away-from-it-all trip, although you're still in the U.S."" Rooms start at about $775 a night. The resort is offering a New Year's Eve prix fixe dinner for $125 per person and will treat guests to a special fireworks show over Hulopo`e Bay. Luminous Santa Fe . This adobe wonderland at the foot of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in New Mexico draws art lovers, foodies and outdoor enthusiasts all year round. But Hough noted the destination is especially beautiful during the holidays with ""farolitos"" -- or lanterns -- placed along the Santa Fe Plaza and the city's art gallery district. ""It's very pretty and very easy to get to. ... You're also not that far from skiing,"" she said. There are plenty of posh accommodations to ring in the New Year in style. Hough recommended staying at the Encantado for a ""resorty, out-of-town experience"" or the Rosewood Inn of the Anasazi in the heart of the city near the Plaza. Rates for both start at several hundred dollars a night around New Year's Eve. Mega-yacht in St. Barts . Join celebrities and billionaires who spend New Year's Eve partying aboard yachts moored in St. Barts' famed Gustavia Harbor. Stars like Demi Moore, Beyonce and Salma Hayek have been spotted celebrating on the Caribbean island in recent years, taking in the fireworks at midnight and staying to get a suntan on New Year's Day. Don't have your own ship? No worries. SeaDream, which offers cruises on luxury ""mega-yachts"" that carry up to 112 passengers, is sending both of its ships to the picturesque harbor on the big night as part of itineraries that also take you to other parts of the Caribbean. ""You feel like you're on a yacht yourself rather than a big cruise ship,"" said Sue Bryant, a contributing editor for CruiseCritic.com, who has sailed on the SeaDream II. She praised the ship's ""foodie"" cuisine and attentive service. ""The first day we were sunbathing on deck, somebody tapped me on the shoulder and said, 'Ms. Bryant, may I polish your sun glasses?' I've never had anyone say that before."" The voyages start at about $5,000 per person. Romantic Vienna . There is something magical about Vienna during the holidays, but the city on the Danube really goes all out for New Year's, with elegant galas and an imperial ball to mark the occasion. For a classic experience, stay at the famous Hotel Sacher, located next to the Vienna State Opera. You can start your night there with a 6-course New Year's Eve gala dinner, which features dishes such as beef consommÃ© with truffle-celery ravioli and turbot with lobster jelly. For 364 euros per person (about $486), the hotel also offers a package that will take you from the festive meal right to the Kaiserball -- a grand ball in the Hofburg Palace, the former residence of Austria's monarchs. On New Year's Day, music lovers who have been lucky enough to score a ticket can attend the elegant ""Neujahrskonzert"" -- the New Year's Concert at the Vienna Philharmonic, where Strauss waltzes rule the program. African desert adventure . New Year's Eve celebrations usually involve crowds, but this getaway to Morocco will have you and a select group of adventurers marking the occasion in the Sahara, away from most signs of civilization. The journey begins in Fez and continues to the oasis city of Erfoud, said Mary Ann Ramsey, president of Betty Maclean Travel in Naples, Florida, who arranges the trips through Abercrombie & Kent. Traveling by four-wheel drive and by camel, you go out into the desert and the huge Erg Chebbi sand dunes. Guests spend the night in a luxury tented desert camp -- an experience Ramsey described as ""incredible"" and ""spectacular."" ""To me, that would be the coolest place to be for New Year's Eve,"" Ramsey said. ""I've had people go out there to propose. ... It is the most romantic and fabulous [experience] -- the stars are their own fireworks. There are so many stars because there's nothing nearby."" The full itinerary costs about $13,460 per person, an Abercrombie & Kent spokeswoman said. Caribbean fantasy . Ready to be whisked off for an over-the-top experience? This ""Fully Loaded"" New Year's Eve package at the Gansevoort Turks and Caicos resort starts at $100,000. That price includes private jet service to and from the island of Providenciales, accommodations in the oceanfront penthouse suite and your own on-call spa therapist for massages, yoga and other treatments. On the big night, you take a luxury catamaran excursion to a secluded cove, where a personal chef prepares your meal, a personal conch diving instructor takes you out for an underwater adventure, and a personal videographer films your journey. You'll usher in 2012 while ""glamping"" (that's camping with a glamorous twist) in a luxury tent. The Gansevoort Turks and Caicos resort was among the winners of TripAdvisor's 2011 Travelers' Choice awards -- chosen by the site's members as one of the top 10 trendiest and most relaxing hotels and in the world.","These itineraries require deep pockets, but will set the tone for an amazing New Year .

"(CNN) -- The New Hampshire primary will tell us a good deal more than the Iowa caucuses did about where the Republican candidates stand and how they might do in the general election against President Barack Obama. While the unpredictable nature of the Iowa caucuses offered Rick Santorum an opportunity to shine, Tuesday's vote will tell us where the party is really headed, in what has been a Wild West of a presidential selection process, one with more ups and downs than the Colorado Rockies. The New Hampshire primary, established in 1916, has a long and treasured history in American politics. It has often been the site where new voices have been able to upset the status quo and take on establishment figures. In 1952, the military hero Dwight Eisenhower successfully challenged ""Mr. Republican"" Robert Taft, the senator from Ohio, who was thought to be one of the strongest figures in the party. That same year, Tennessee Sen. Estes Kefauver shook up the Democratic Party by winning a stunning victory against President Harry Truman, fueling his decision not to run for re-election. In 1968, Minnesota Sen. Eugene McCarthy's strong second-place showing similarly upset President Lyndon Johnson, forcing him to think twice about how strong his support was within the Democratic Party. The results, Sen. Ted Kennedy recalled, demonstrated that ""overnight, Johnson had become beatable."" A few weeks later Johnson told the nation that he would not run for re-election. In 1976, the little-known Jimmy Carter built on his surprise victory in the Iowa caucuses by winning in New Hampshire and cementing his status as a front-runner. Republican Patrick Buchanan revealed the soft support among conservatives in 1992 for President George H.W. Bush, whom Buchanan derided as ""King George,"" when he did better than expected against the president (though Bush won). To be sure, the outcome of the primary is not always a measure of who will win the party's nomination. There is a substantial list of New Hampshire losers -- including Barack Obama in 2008, George W. Bush in 2000, Bill Clinton in 1992, and Walter Mondale in 1984 -- who went on to receive party nominations. Most important, New Hampshire is a state where independents matter very much and turn out in large numbers. The primary allows unaffiliated voters to participate, thus boosting the number of participants from the middle of the political spectrum. With the base of each party relatively deflated about the choices in 2012 (liberal Democrats are disappointed in Obama's record, while conservatives are not overly enthused about any of the front-runners), the 2012 election will likely come down to the person who can capture the center. With Obama's approval ratings at a low ebb, Republicans have a major opportunity if they can win the hearts and minds of independents and centrist Democrats. One of Mitt Romney's biggest selling points is that he offers the GOP the only candidate who can run as a moderate who is not beholden to the party's base. During one of the weekend debates he brushed back talk about making contraception illegal and tried to focus on his economic policy rather than social and cultural issues. He left the others to fight it out as to who was a ""big-government conservative"" and who was not. In New Hampshire, Romney will have the first chance to show that his appeal to centrists is a strength. Republicans in New Hampshire tend to fit the profile of the kind of conservative candidate who will have the greatest national appeal. While Republican party activists are often attracted to the candidate who can speak the language of the religious right, the Republican with the best chance of taking Obama in this election will be the fiscal conservative who pushes for lowering the deficit, lowering spending, and containing taxes, while avoiding the cultural issues that turn off moderates. In 2008, according to ABC News, only 23% of the New Hampshire electorate said they were evangelicals, compared with 58% in Iowa this year. Finally, New Hampshire looks more like a national election than does Iowa. While Americans like to think our political process works by retail politics, with candidates shaking hands and enjoying a meal at the local diner, the reality is that elections are won or lost on major media -- television, radio and the Internet. The candidate who has the best ability to mount a national campaign is the person who can master the media, handling reporters and the 24-hour news cycle, and can amass the kind of money that is needed to buy TV ads In New Hampshire. It is simply not possible to win the state only by shaking hands. A candidate has to be able to do well on the screen. This is a year when New Hampshire's verdict will be key in evaluating the Republican field. The test is not completely fair in that Romney comes from this region and even has a home in this state. That said, being local is not a guarantee of victory. While a close victory in Iowa was certainly something that Romney can live with, he needs to have a very strong showing in New Hampshire to demonstrate that he is as electable a candidate as he has promised to be. He has to answer the kind of challenge posed in Sunday's debate, when Newt Gingrich said Romney would ""have a very hard time getting elected"" in a race against Obama. At the same time, this is a major opportunity for Romney's opponents (especially Jon Huntsman) to show that they fit the bill as well, and that the prospect of Romney winning the nomination is not inevitable. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: Iowa gave Santorum prominence but N.H. vote is likely to be more revealing .
He says the primary will test whether Romney is strong with centrist voters .
The primary has been a place to challenge establishment figures, Zelizer says .

"(PEOPLE.com) -- Katy Perry's parents, who are evangelical ministers, mentioned their famous daughter a number of times at religious services in Ohio on Wednesday, but sidestepped the issue of her divorce from Russell Brand. Keith and Mary Hudson, who arrived at Church on the Rise in Westlake, outside Cleveland, to host two nights of ""prophetic services,"" said they attend Perry's concerts even though they don't love the idea of people worshiping pop idols. ""I only go for one reason and one reason only ... because I love my daughter and I will always love her,"" Keith Hudson said. ""It was almost like church,"" he added of the concert experience, adding that Perry's fans ""want to worship and they want to love, they are just worshiping and loving the wrong person."" The Hudsons billed themselves as ""Katy Perry's parents"" on marketing materials for the event, but then told the crowd of about 300 that they don't need help from anyone famous -- or their relatives -- to find God. ""I'm sure that Katy's trending on the Internet was to get you here to church tonight,"" Mary Hudson said in her opening remarks. ""You don't need a verse or a scripture. You don't need Katy Perry's father,"" Keith said later. ""In the news they call us, 'Katy Perry's parents are religious.' Do I look religious?"" Keith, who did most of the speaking, said he converted from a drug user to a Christian when he was 24 years old. He touched on the evolution of church, developing a relationship with Jesus, and keeping a relationship with one's children. ""What has taken place in my daughter's life has opened many opportunities to go in and be with guarded and gated people,"" he said. ""They like us because we're cool. We are not threatening."" He added: ""The most important people on this Earth are your family. What would heaven be like without your children?"" At the end, the Hudsons signed books, sold jewelry to fund a women's mission, and gave away samples of Katy's perfume, Purr. See the full article at PEOPLE.com. © 2011 People and Time Inc.

"(CNN) -- North Korea, whose leader Kim Jong Il died over the weekend, is the least democratic nation on Earth, according to a newly released report by a British analysis and intelligence firm. The Democracy Index 2011, compiled by the Economist Intelligence Unit, listed Norway as the most democratic nation in the world. The top 10 spots in this year's index were occupied mostly by European countries. Following Norway were: Iceland, Denmark, Sweden, New Zealand, Australia, Switzerland, Canada, Finland and the Netherlands. Read the full report . The United States ranked 19th, down two spots from the 2010 listing. The United States' 2011 ranking is below Canada (8th) and the United Kingdom (18th). The United States also ranked below the Czech Republic (16th), a former Soviet communist satellite that did not become a democracy until 1989, and the South American nation of Uruguay (17th), a former right-wing dictatorship that did not return to democracy until 1984. The Economist Intelligence Unit analysis, released this month, concluded that democracy deteriorated in 48 countries, improved in 41 and stayed the same in 78. In most regions, the report said, the level of democracy was lower in 2011 than the previous year. ""2011 was an exceptionally turbulent year, characterized by sovereign debt crises and weak political leadership in the developed world, dramatic political change and conflict in the Middle East and North Africa and rising social unrest,"" said Laza Kekic, the report's lead author. The Democracy Index is based on five categories: electoral process and pluralism, civil liberties, how government functions, political participation by the public, and political culture. The analysts measured the level of democracy in 165 nations and two territories, ""which account for almost the entire population of the world,"" the Economist Intelligence Unit said in a release. Using a scale of 0 to 10, countries were placed in one of four categories: full democracies (8-10), flawed democracies (6 to 7.9), hybrid regimes (4 to 5.9) and authoritarian regimes (0 to 3.9). Norway, the top-ranked nation, had a score of 9.8. The Scandinavian nation also ranked No. 1 in 2010 with an identical score. North Korea, ranked No. 167, had a score of 1.08. The Asian nation also ranked last in 2010, with the same score. The United States had a score of 8.11, slightly lower than last year's 8.18. ""U.S. democracy has been adversely affected by a deepening of the polarization of the political scene and political brinkmanship and paralysis,"" the Economist Intelligence Unit concluded. The analysts noted that the United States and the United Kingdom lag behind many other full democracies for some of the same reasons. ""There has been a rise in protest movements,"" the report states. ""Problems in the functioning of government have become more prominent."" Among other findings in the report: . -- Slightly more than half the world's population lives in some type of democracy, although only 11% enjoy a ""full democracy."" -- More than one-third of the globe's population lives under authoritarian rule. -- Nearly half the nations on the planet are considered democracies: 25 ""full"" and 53 ""flawed."" -- There were 37 ""hybrid regimes"" and 52 ""authoritarian regimes."" -- Violence, drug trafficking and other crime in Latin America continue to hinder democracy. -- Eastern Europe continued to suffer a decline in democracy, with 12 nations worse than the previous year. -- Western Europe also had a decline in democracy, with seven nations deteriorating and none improving. Some of that deterioration was due to financial problems plaguing the eurozone. Five of the countries that lost points in the rankings belong to the eurozone: Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ireland. -- Eight countries had a listing change from one type of government to another in 2011. Four were upgraded and four were downgraded. -- Countries that deteriorated were: Portugal (fell from full to flawed democracy), Ukraine and Guatemala (flawed democracy to hybrid regime) and Russia (hybrid to authoritarian regime). -- Zambia improved from a hybrid to a flawed democracy. Tunisia, Mauritania and Niger moved up from authoritarian to hybrid. In the Western Hemisphere, Costa Rica is ranked 20th, up five spots from last year. That nation's score was 8.10, nearly the same as the United States. Costa Rica is listed as a full democracy. Western Hemisphere flawed democracies are: Chile (35th, 7.54); Trinidad and Tobago (43rd, 7.16); Brazil (45th; 7.12); Panama (47th, 7.08); Mexico (50th, 6.93); Argentina (51st, 6.84); Colombia (55th, 6.63); Peru (56th, 6.59); El Salvador (61st, 6.47); Paraguay (62nd, 6.40); Dominican Republic (70th, 6.20) and Guyana (77th, 6.05). Western Hemisphere nations listed as hybrid regimes are: Guatemala (82nd, 5.88); Bolivia (84th, 5.84); Honduras (84th, 5.84); Ecuador (89th, 5.72); Nicaragua (91st, 5.56); Venezuela (97th, 5.08) and Haiti (114th, 4.00). Cuba (126th, 3.52) is the only Western Hemisphere nation categorized as authoritarian. Full democracies worldwide include: Luxembourg, Ireland, Austria, Germany, Malta, Japan, South Korea, Belgium, Mauritius and Spain. Some nations categorized as flawed democracies include: South Africa, France, Italy, India, Indonesia and Philippines. Hybrid regimes include: Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangladesh, Turkey, Palestine, Cambodia, Pakistan and Iraq. Authoritarian nations include: Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, China, Vietnam, United Arab Emirates, Afghanistan and Laos. In addition to North Korea, the other nine least-democratic nations are: Chad, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Myanmar, Equatorial Guinea, Saudi Arabia, Central African Republic, Iran and Syria. The Economist Intelligence Unit, which performed the analysis, is based in London and reports having offices in more than 40 cities worldwide. The company says it has about 650 country experts and analysts worldwide. The Democracy Index 2011 was released December 15. The latest Democracy Index closely mirrors a Corruption Perceptions Index released by the German watchdog organization Transparency International in late November. In that analysis, New Zealand was perceived as the least corrupt nation on earth, and Somalia and North Korea were seen as the most corrupt. The United States ranked 24th least corrupt on a ""corruption perceptions index,"" the fourth-best in the Western Hemisphere. Canada ranked 10th, the Bahamas was 21st and Chile was 22nd. Overall, the top spots were occupied mostly by European countries, with the exception of New Zealand, Singapore at No. 5 and Australia, which was tied for eighth with Switzerland. Other nations with top rankings were Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands. In addition to Somalia and North Korea, which were tied for last at No. 182, the bottom of the list included Myanmar, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Sudan, Iraq, Haiti and Venezuela. The report was prepared by the independent, nonpartisan Transparency International organization, which said it drew its conclusions based ""on different assessments and business opinion surveys carried out by independent and reputable institutions."" The information used to compile the index included ""questions relating to the bribery of public officials, kickbacks in public procurement, embezzlement of public funds and questions that probe the strength and effectiveness of public-sector and anti-corruption efforts,"" Transparency International said. Perceptions are used, the organization said, because corruption is a hidden activity that is difficult to measure. ""Over time,"" the organization said in its report, ""perceptions have proved to be a reliable estimate of corruption."" The rankings for other Western Hemisphere countries were: Uruguay (25), Puerto Rico (39), Costa Rica (50), Cuba (61), Brazil (73), Colombia, El Salvador and Peru (tied for 80), Panama (86), Argentina and Mexico (tied for 100), Bolivia (118), Ecuador and Guatemala (tied for 120), the Dominican Republic and Honduras (tied for 129), Nicaragua (134), Paraguay (154), Venezuela (172) and Haiti (175). The index used a scale of 0-10 to measure perceived corruption, with zero representing highly corrupt and 10 being very clean. New Zealand, the highest-ranked nation, has a 9.5 score. Somalia and North Korea, the lowest-ranked, had 1.0. The United States scored 7.1, while Canada was 8.7 and Chile was 7.2. Haiti, the lowest-ranked nation in the Western Hemisphere, scored 1.8. Next-worst was Venezuela with 1.9. Transparency International, headquartered in Berlin, reports having 90 chapters worldwide. The organization says it works with partners in government, business and civil society to develop and implement effective measures to combat corruption.","Norway is listed as the most democratic nation in the British report .

"(PEOPLE.com) -- Three and a half weeks since having a double mastectomy, Giuliana Rancic says she's ""doing better than I anticipated in recovery.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Almost all British troops in Iraq are being pulled out because the agreement that allows them to be there expires on Friday, the British Ministry of Defence said Tuesday. Nearly all of Britain's troops in Iraq will have left by the week's end. The withdrawal marks the first time since the invasion of Iraq more than six years ago that there will be almost no British troops in the country. The only British troops there will be a group of about a dozen helping to train Iraqi police as part of a NATO mission, the ministry said. The United Kingdom's remaining contingent of 100 to 150 troops is leaving Iraq for neighboring Kuwait, a Ministry of Defence spokesman told CNN. He declined to be named in line with policy. ""The small handful of British military personnel operating in Iraq will be withdrawn to Kuwait after Iraq's parliament adjourned without passing a deal that would let them stay,"" the spokesman said. Iraq must give its permission for foreign troops to be on its soil. It was a group of Iraqi lawmakers loyal to anti-American Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr that prevented parliament from approving a new agreement on British troops. They walked out of parliament as a group on July 11, depriving the legislature of the minimum number of lawmakers necessary for votes to take place. Parliament is now on summer recess until September 8. Fawzi Akram, a lawmaker from the Sadr bloc, confirmed that the bloc reject the Iraqi-British security agreement. He said that Iraq does not need the British troops and that Iraqi security forces are ready to handle security on their own. Britain hopes the Iraqi parliament will eventually approve the security agreement. ""While this delay is unfortunate, we are continuing to seek a solution with the Iraqi Government that will provide our forces with the sound legal basis they need,"" the ministry said in a written statement. The British troops who are being pulled out include Royal Navy servicemen who have been helping the Iraqis to protect oil fields around the port town of Umm Qasr, according to the Ministry of Defence spokesman. All British combat troops have already left the country, another ministry spokesman told CNN. There were about 46,000 British troops in and around Iraq at the peak of major combat operations in March and April 2003, according to the Ministry of Defence. CNN's Jonathan Wald in London and Youssif Basil in Baghdad, Iraq, contributed to this report.","Almost all British troops in Iraq are being pulled out .

"(CNN) -- Petra Kvitova will face Victoria Azarenka in the final of the WTA Championships in Istanbul on Sunday. The reigning Wimbledon champion recovered from a set down against Australia's Samantha Stosur to eventually win 5-7 6-3 6-3. Belarussian, Azarenka enjoyed a more comfortable 6-2 6-3 win over Russia's Vera Zvonareva. Kvitova started brightly enough against Stosur taking a 4-2 lead in the opening set, but then a series of unforced errors let the increasingly confident Australian back into the contest. It wasn't long though before the left-handed Czech soon found her rhythm grinding down the spirited Stosur with a series of forehand winners to take the second set and level the match. Kvitova then raced into a 4-0 lead in the deciding set before Stosur pulled one break back but it was too late to save the match. The 22-year-old Azarenka, meanwhile, enjoyed much the better of a series of baseline rallies with her Russian opponent, and despite her serve not being in the best order ran out an easy winner. The victor on Sunday will rise to number two in the world rankings. Kvitova will start as favourite as she has won the two previous meetings between the pair this year.","Reigning Wimbledon champion will face Belarussian in WTA Championship final .

"(CNN) -- Veteran striker Raul Gonzalez scored his 71st Champions League goal to help Schalke beat holders Inter Milan 2-1 on the night and 7-3 on aggregate to reach the semifinals of the competition on Wednesday. Already in the driving seat after their stunning 5-2 first leg win at the San Siro, the German Bundesliga side never looked likely to relinquish their advantage and eased through to the last four, where they will now face Manchester United. Raul opened the scoring on the stroke of half-time, controlling an inch-perfect pass from compatriot Jose Manuel Jurado, before rounding goalkeeper Julio Cesar to slip the ball home. However, the Italian side levelled the scores just four minutes later when Thiago Motta was left unmarked from a corner to head home. Benedikt Hoewedes then had a header ruled out for offside, but the Schalke defender was not to be denied and he hit the winner with nine minutes remaining, firing home after latching onto Raul's pass. Schalke coach Ralf Rangnick told reporters: ""We have produced two great performances against Inter. ""If you only allow the Champions League winners a couple of chances, you know you have played well. ""Each player worked hard for each other and that was the key to our success,"" he added.

""I got to be physical with some of the hottest guys in Hollywood,"" Carano, who tussles with Channing Tatum, Ewan McGregor and Michael Fassbender in the film, told PEOPLE at the BlackBerry-sponsored Cinema Society screening this week. Fassbender, in particular, was the recipient of a vase to the face when the two were filming a fight scene and he accidentally KO'd Carano. ""When Fassbender slammed my head into the wall, that's the only time I went black,"" Carano, 29, said about the shoot, during which she also reportedly knocked out a stuntman. ""And then I slammed a vase right into his face when he wasn't expecting it."" ""He didn't get cut,"" Carano clarified, before adding, ""maybe a little bit."" McGregor, for his part, said he also emerged ""sore"" from his scenes with Carano but called the fight scenes ""good fun."" But Tatum, whom she describes as ""like a bro,"" is one actor Carano says she wouldn't want to fight in real life. ""I'd probably want to choke him out real quick,"" she said. ""Because he's actually very athletic."" Return to MMA? Carano has officially retired from MMA but says she hasn't ruled out a return. To prepare for the role as a Black Ops agent in ""Haywire,"" she worked with a Hollywood stunt crew and attended a two-month training camp with a former Israeli intelligence operative. According to Soderbergh, it was his intention to have Carano -- who is a 5-feet 8-inches tall and 143 pounds. -- rather than one of her male costars, be the toughest character in the film. ""There was something transgressive about having the woman being the one who is attacked first,"" Soderbergh recently told Sports Illustrated. ""There's sort of, in movie terms, a popular conception that women are weaker than men and that the only way that they can triumph in a hand-to-hand situation is if they somehow have an advantage from the beginning. ...

"(CNN) -- The name of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie surfaced once again in the national news this week, floated by some as a possible new entrant in the ever-widening, fickle field of Republican presidential contenders. But Christie got even more attention on his own by heading straight to the ""Jersey Shore"" -- the TV show. On Monday, Christie vetoed a $420,000 tax break previously granted to MTV's most popular program -- the highly viewed and just as highly derided reality series featuring Snooki, The Situation and other often inebriated free-range narcissists. In denying the show's producers the New Jersey Economic Development Authority's 20% tax credit on TV shows filmed or produced in the state, Christie said it was unjustifiable ""for a project which does nothing more than perpetuate misconceptions about the state and its citizens."" Like a rain-slicked Atlantic City boardwalk as it snakes its way to the shore, that's some slippery ground on which Christie is treading. It's difficult, maybe even impossible, to disagree with him on the position of being anti-""Jersey Shore"": Anything that slows the spread of that video virus is, almost by definition, a good thing. But what if the same logic and political tactics had been used on, say, HBO's ""The Sopranos""? Even if that sort of concern amounts to fiscal responsibility, it also amounts to artistic irresponsibility. Politicians have attacked TV before, but the attention they draw rarely has them getting the last word, or being awarded the final victory. Dan Quayle vs. ""Murphy Brown""? The CBS sitcom won that one, handily; the single mother about whom Quayle was so upset was, after all, a fictional TV character. George H.W. Bush, in 1992, campaigned by promising to make American families ""a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons."" Bart, one of the animated characters on ""The Simpsons,"" retaliated almost instantly in a quickly dubbed opening credits sequence, replying, ""We're just like the Waltons. We're praying for an end to the Depression, too."" Christie, by pulling the state purse strings tighter and refusing to hand over rebate tax credit money to TV productions that make New Jersey look bad, is wielding a heavy club. Where else, after all, could ""Jersey Shore"" film its reality-show escapades? Italy? (Actually, yes. They've done just that. But MTV and ""Jersey Shore"" haven't yet gone to the original Jersey shore, nestled in the English Channel and part of the United Kingdom. Maybe next year.) Or maybe, if CW's ""H8R"" lasts another season (which is doubtful), Christie could come on as a Snooki ""hater,"" as a nonfan did to confront the ""Jersey Shore"" standout star in this month's season premiere, and take away her show's tax credits on camera. But really, the biggest media storm he could generate here, and the one that would score him even stronger political points, would be to make the tax credits, or the denial of them, qualitative as well as quantitative, and thus support the arts in the most measurable way possible. Bear with me here: Christie could make it a policy to give tax rebates for the quality shows, and levy fines -- tackiness taxes, if you will -- for those that besmirch New Jersey in particular and the lively arts in general. Make good TV and movies, you get money back. Make bad TV and movies, you pay a surcharge. Under such a system, the better the TV show or movie, the higher the tax incentives. (This works for the other arts as well: Bruce Springsteen could do whatever he wants in Jersey, which is kind of the way things are now anyway.) Conversely, the lower a visiting TV or film production sets the crassness bar, the higher the state should set the additional taxes for filming in Jersey. That way, when something as outstanding and artistic as ""The Sopranos"" shoots on location in the Garden State, it gets a break. The ""Real Housewives of New Jersey,"" on the other hand, gets broken. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Bianculli.","David Bianculli notes Gov. Chris Christie is in news for ""Jersey Shore"" decision .

"New York (CNN) -- A mix of protesters gathered again Friday in cities across the country, decrying a loosely defined list of financial problems and mixing in places with others marking the 10-year anniversary of the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan. Demonstrators in New York and Washington appeared to congregate over both the Afghan conflict, arguably America's longest war, and in protest against the widening disparities between rich and poor and corporate greed, among other grievances. New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said an investigation is under way after protesters claimed officers used excessive force when corralling demonstrators earlier this week. He also noted that demonstrations had cost tax payers $1.9 million in overtime costs for the city's law enforcement. CNN affiliate stations also broadcast images of crowds that gathered in Austin, Texas, as well as Minneapolis, Minnesota; Seattle, Washington and Atlanta, Georgia. The activity came a day after President Barack Obama discussed the growing movement, saying demonstrators ""are giving voice to a more broad-based frustration about how our financial system works."" Speaking at a White House news conference, Obama also defended the country's financial sector, which has taken the brunt of protesters' criticism, focusing on Wall Street and its regulators' purported role in expanding economic disparities. ""We have to have a strong, effective financial sector in order for us to grow,"" the president said. Still, Obama discussed a need to pursue action aimed at improving government oversight and blamed Republican lawmakers for obstructing financial reforms. Friday marked the 21st day of the grass-roots Wall Street protests. Demonstrations have erupted in more than a dozen cities throughout the week, ranging from thousands who marched in lower Manhattan Wednesday after receiving support from local unions, to the dozens of college students who staged walkouts at various college campuses. Open Story: See iReports from the protests. The movement started in New York and some of the protests there have been marred by scuffles with police. New York authorities set up at least one vehicle checkpoint as police appeared in larger numbers throughout the financial district Thursday and established a perimeter around Zuccotti Park, which is considered a rallying point for the largely leaderless movement in that city. ""We hope that our message continues to resonate with everyone who has felt disenfranchised by the current state of our country,"" said Tyler Combelic, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street group. He said they plan to ""continue the protest until the message reaches every house in the United States."" The specifics of that message remains largely unclear.

"(CNN) -- Facebook is ramping up the fight against those annoying and potentially harmful scam attacks. The site is teaming up with Websense, a San Diego, California-based Internet security firm, to warn users when they're about to leave Facebook for a site that might be trying to steal their personal data. Starting today, any link users click on Facebook will be checked against Websense's database of sites that might contain malware or be used for ""phishing"" of the user's credit card or other personal information. If a site shows up on the list, a page will pop up warning users and asking them whether they'd like to go back, get more information or proceed at their own risk. ""A platform as popular as Facebook is naturally a target for attackers,"" Websense wrote on its blog. ""We have been working with Facebook and their security teams for a number of years in order to keep their users safe, but now we have integrated directly into the platform for an unprecedented security combination."" In a recent survey by Websense of 4,640 technology and security professionals, 52 percent said their businesses have experienced an increase in viruses and malware attacks because of employees' use of social-media sites like Facebook and Twitter. Twenty-three percent said they hadn't seen an increase, and 25 percent said they weren't sure. With a user base of some 800 million users, Facebook is fertile hunting ground for scammers and hackers. Often, users who click bad links will be infected with malware that causes them to, in turn, share the bad link with their friends. A common scammer technique is to post what appears to be an outrageous or racy link. When someone clicks the link, they are asked to enter their Facebook log-in information again to see the video or other post -- thus giving that info to the hackers. ""By providing real-time protection from malware, spyware, inappropriate content, data leaks, and spam, we make it safe for people and businesses to use the web,"" said Websense chief technology officer Dan Hubbard.

"Perugia, Italy (CNN) -- A lawyer for Amanda Knox said Thursday the only option for the jury considering her murder appeal in Italy is to clear her of guilt. Knox's lawyers gave their final arguments in Perugia Thursday in an effort to counter prosecutors' portrayal of her as a cunning ""femme fatale."" Lawyer Carlo Dalla Vedova told the jury 'that the only possible decision to take is that of absolving Amanda Knox,"" as he wrapped up his closing argument. He said the court had already seen ""there is not trace of Amanda Knox in the room where murder took place."" Knox and her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito are fighting to overturn their 2009 convictions for the murder of Meredith Kercher, Knox's British housemate who was found with her throat slashed two years earlier. The judge said there will be no ruling in the case until after defendant statements on Monday. The second of Knox's lawyers to speak, Luciano Ghirga, said Knox was ""very afraid but her heart is full of hope and she hopes to return to freedom."" Her ""image was massacred"" by the media and the attacks on her character started before the trial, he said, adding that he considered her as a daughter. Concluding an emotional appearance, he appealed to the jury to put themselves in the shoes of Knox's family -- a counterpoise to the words of appeals court prosecutor Giancarlo Costagliola, who asked the jury to put themselves in the shoes of Kercher's family at the start of the closing arguments a week ago. The ""clan Knox"" -- as Knox's family have been referred to -- are not part of some rumored U.S. conspiracy to put pressure on the Italian courts to release her, Ghirga said. Rather, ""they are parents and they deserve respect."" The lawyer also praised the court's work, saying he felt Knox's rights had finally been respected. Urging the jury not to let innocent people stay in jail, Vedova earlier detailed what he called many ""mistakes"" made in the investigation into Kercher's death. When Knox was arrested and interrogated, she was not allowed a translator and was discouraged from getting a lawyer, Vedova said. ""'That night Amanda Knox's right to defend herself was denied,"" he said. ""She was just a young girl, first time out of the country. She didn't speak Italian."" Vedova argued that some of the DNA evidence presented by the prosecution should be thrown out. He said some material was contaminated as a result of poor practice by police, including supposed traces of mixed blood in the bathroom sink shared by the two girls. The prosecution's use of alleged bloody footprints in their case was also wrong, he said. As for the knife used to kill Kercher, a key piece of evidence, Vedova told the court there was a ""concentration of nothingness, a fantasy"" in the prosecution's arguments. He ridiculed a theory that Sollecito had not disposed of the knife because he was concerned his landlady would notice it was missing, asking: ""What kind of a killer would think about this after committing a murder?"" Vedova claimed forensics experts who examined computers belonging to Knox and Sollecito had destroyed the machines and with them evidence that was certain to be favorable to the defendants. This included photographs of Knox and Kercher together that demonstrated they were friends, he said. Showing the court panoramic pictures of the villa Knox shared with Kercher, Vedova rejected the prosecution claim that a fake robbery had been staged by someone inside the house to try to cover up what had happened. He also suggested the original court had taken sides over some of the evidence, choosing to accept as credible some witnesses whose testimony went against Knox and rejecting others who were in her favor. Knox's attorneys' statements follow arguments presented this week by the lawyer of her co-defendant. Lawyer Giulia Bongiorno said Tuesday that Knox is not the character the media has painted her to be, and urged a jury to acquit Knox and Sollecito of murdering Kercher. Bongiorno compared Knox to the voluptuous cartoon character Jessica Rabbit, who protests, ""I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way,"" in the movie ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" Bongiorno said the whole trial was based on DNA evidence ""on which mistakes were made,"" and urged the jury to ""abandon imagined fantasies"" and acquit the pair. Knox and Sollecito were convicted in 2009. Knox was sentenced to 26 years in prison, while Sollecito got 25. In her closing arguments, Bongiorno said there was no physical trace of Knox or Sollecito in the room where Kercher was found murdered. ""The room speaks only of Rudy"" Guede, the other man convicted separately of killing Kercher, Bongiorno told the jury. Knox and Sollecito's defense teams have suggested Guede, who is already serving a 16-year sentence for the murder, could have been the sole killer. Evidence that Guede was in the room shows that ""no one could enter that room and not leave any trace,"" Bongiorno said. And she hammered home attacks on DNA evidence that has been a key part of the appeal. She, too, said police could have contaminated the crime scene or the evidence, playing video from the police investigation to make her point. Knox and Sollecito are appealing the convictions together, having been convicted in a joint trial.

"(CNN) -- The 2012 presidential race has been dominated by one issue: the economy. Americans are desperately looking for a leader who can steer the country into full recovery; anything else is peripheral at this point. This past weekend, however, the presidential race was harmfully thrown off course. I'm referring to the words of Pastor Robert Jeffress of the First Baptist Church of Dallas, Texas. Jeffress introduced Texas Gov. Rick Perry at the Values Voters Summit in Washington D.C. on Friday and strongly endorsed him, primarily because of his evangelical Christian beliefs. Shortly after the introduction, Jeffress said to reporters: ""Every true, born-again follower of Christ ought to embrace a Christian over a non-Christian."" Jeffress called Mormonism a ""cult,"" and asked by a reporter if he believed Gov. Mitt Romney is a Christian, answered, ""No."" Romney, of course, is Mormon. Jeffress' words echoed what he said in 2008 about Romney, when he told the Religion Newswriters Association at its annual meeting: ""The value of electing a Christian goes beyond public policies ... It is worse to legitimize a faith that would lead people to a separation from God."" In essence, Jeffress implied that voting for Mitt Romney would give credibility to a cult. After hearing Jeffress' remarks, I decided to respond when I spoke at the same summit on Saturday. The Romney campaign contacted me before my speech about another speaker, Bryan Fischer, who has a history of controversial remarks concerning Mormonism. But Romney's campaign had no say in my words to Jeffress. I said to Jeffress, along with everyone else, ""Do not give voice to bigotry. Remember George Washington, his manly advice to us, to despise all forms of racial and religious bigotry. He who was first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen, counseled, 'We should give to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance.' ""Let's follow him. And I would say to Pastor Jeffress, you stepped on and obscured the words of Perry and Santorum and Cain and Bachmann and everyone else who has spoken here. You did Rick Perry no good, sir, in what you had to say."" I agree that there are serious theological differences between evangelical Christianity and Mormonism. But those should be settled in churches, in homes, and in religious gatherings, not in front of a national political event. Pastor Jeffress says his words were merely theological. He, pastor of a successful mega-church, should know full well the fine line between religion and politics. His words were clearly political, as evidenced by the damaging effect it had on the Republican presidential candidates and the national debate. Gov. Perry immediately had to distance himself from Jeffress' words. Gov. Romney quickly went on the defensive. And the other candidates, instantly grilled by the national media about their view of Mormonism, were thrown into a controversy they wanted no part of. Jeffress' words were an inappropriate and deleterious distraction. Article Six of the Constitution states that ""no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States."" The purpose of a political gathering like the Values Voters Summit is to build consensus around a candidate by examining positions and records. Yes, religion plays an essential role in those decisions, but one person's faith should never be a disqualifying factor, whether that person is Jewish, Christian, Catholic, Muslim, Mormon, or of any other faith. To the right and left alike, we are in the middle of a grueling presidential campaign season. It behooves us to despise and reject all forms of religious, and racial, bigotry. Politics are about policy and deciding whether a candidate shares your views of the founding principles of this country -- life, liberty, and the rule of law -- which men and women of all different faiths can agree upon. When Abraham Lincoln spoke in 1838 to the Young Men's Lyceum of Springfield, Illinois, concerning the ""perpetuation of our political institutions,"" he admonished participants: ""Let reverence for the laws ... become the political religion of the nation."" We do not need, nor should we have, a religious test for public office. Should we choose to hold someone's faith against him or her, we hurt only ourselves. Our chances of winning the 2012 presidential election depend on building the broadest coalition we can, not breaking it down. I do not question the theological knowledge of Pastor Jeffress, and, to his credit, he has said that he would vote for Romney should he win the nomination. Nevertheless, his comments were ill-timed and of poor taste. Again, the timeless wisdom of George Washington comes to mind. In a letter to the Hebrew Congregation of Newport, Rhode Island, Washington wrote, ""May the Children of the Stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other inhabitants, while every one shall sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree, and there shall be none to make him afraid."" The opinions in this commentary are solely those of William Bennett.","William Bennett: Jeffress' comments about Romney's faith hurt presidential race .
Jeffress, a Perry supporter, said Romney is not a Christian and Mormonism is a cult .
Bennett says we must reject religious, and racial, bigotry; politics are about policy .
There is no religious test for public office and it's a matter of political principles, he says ."
"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- NATO and U.S. forces are seeing a marked increase in infiltration into Afghanistan from Pakistan by the militant Haqqani network, a senior NATO official said Tuesday. There has been a significant increase in the Haqqani network's activity in Khost, Paktia, Logar and Wardak provinces which are used in that order as an infiltration route from Pakistan, to launch attacks on the capital, the official said. The senior NATO official spoke to reporters in Kabul on the condition no name was used. Whether or not NATO and the United States will have to provide more assistance to the Afghan security forces, particularly along the border with Pakistan, will depend on ""the level of threat coming out of Miramshah"" in North Waziristan, the official said. Miramshah is believed to be where the Haqqani network leaders are based. Haqqani fighters are blamed for killing more than 1,000 coalition and Afghan forces. The official said Haqqani militants were behind a series of ""spectacular attacks,"" this summer, including a 20-hour attack on the American Embassy, last month, and an assault on Kabul's InterContinental Hotel, in June, which left at least a dozen people dead. NATO officials said there had also been a marked increase in the number of cross border attacks from Pakistan, but the insisted reports of artillery bombardments and heavy casualties were often exaggerated. International Security Assistance Force troops respond to all reports by deploying surveillance assets, usually helicopters and drones, but they often cannot find evidence of structural damage or the craters consistent with the villagers' accounts of sustained artillery and rocket bombardments, the official explained. The official said ISAF's primary objective is sharing this information with Afghan and Pakistani officials as quickly as possible to diffuse cross-border tensions. Both sides have agreed, within the last ten days, to set up a working group for investigating future allegations. Part of the problem is that insurgents have reoccupied safe havens inside Afghanistan, which became much more attractive following the U.S. withdrawal from remote bases in Kunar and Nuristan provinces, coupled with increased pressure on the Pakistani side of the border, said the official. While most of the cross-border attacks are launched by insurgents, he said there is legitimate confusion as to where the border lies. ""We'll get the maps out and there will be differences of multiples of kilometers of where they think the border is,"" the official said. Gen. John Allen, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, has completed a compressed 90-day assessment and revision of the campaign plan and, contrary to earlier suggestions that there would be an abrupt shift of focus to the east of the country, he concluded that he wants to continue building on progress in the south, while keeping Kabul and its environs secure, eventually linking the two areas via Afghanistan's ring road, the official told reporters. ""As things improve in the south we will focus more on the east,"" the official said. ""Our progress is incremental, but it is progress,"" the official said. ""We have physically taken away their safe havens [in the south], and they won't get them back."" In the east, the focus will be on Kabul and the surrounding provinces, particularly Wardak and Logar, which are being used to launch attacks on the capital, the official said. ""The other issue is the harder one, that's the sense of security in the minds of the Afghan people.... Do the Afghan people feel any more secure? No, not yet."" The military is proving the space for the Afghan government, but the government remains deeply unpopular and corrupt, the official said. Areas likely to be slated for transition in the upcoming second tranche include the Ghazni municipality (capital of Ghazni province Maidan Shah (the capital of Wardak), and Nawa, in Helmand. Kunar is likely to be at least a year away.","Official: Haqqani network has increased infiltration into Afghanistan from Pakistan .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- She's traveled more than 35,000 kilometers hugging the equator, powered entirely by the sun. PlanetSolar, the world's largest solar powered boat, recently stopped off in Hong Kong's Victoria Harbor as part of its 18-month journey around the world. Measuring 31 meters (102 feet) long and 15 meters (49 feet) wide, the catamaran is powered by 537-square meters of photovoltaic solar panels. On a sunny day they produce on average 94 kilowatts of power -- the equivalent to 127 horsepower. Seventy-five percent of the energy propels the boat that travels between 5 and 10 knots an hour. The remainder is used for everything else from flushing toilets to operating the boat's navigational systems. PlanetSolar is the brainchild of 39-year-old Swiss Raphael Domjan. While hiking in Iceland, the former ambulance driver was alarmed to see how quickly the glaciers were melting and decided to find a novel way to raise awareness of global warming. ""If we can go out on the road with this boat, it's a huge boat, only on solar energy, and we live on this boat, everything is working the computer, the telephone, everything is on solar energy. It means everyone can use solar and renewable energy at home everyday,"" Domjan said. Built in Germany at the cost of $26 million dollars, this vessel tracks the sun thanks to state-of-the-art solar technology. ""We can travel around three days with no light,"" explains Christian Ochsenbein, chief engineer aboard the boat. ""But usually there is light everyday even if it's raining. So when we come in a bad weather situation we can expand this time, we reduce this speed and we sail for about 5 days before we run out of battery,"" he added. Planet Solar set sail from Monaco in September 2010 crossing the Atlantic, the Panama Canal and is currently in the Pacific. Next stop is Singapore. It will then travel across the Indian Ocean and the Suez Canal before finally returning to the Mediterranean where it plans to dock back in Monaco in May next year. French captain, Erwann Le Rouzic (one of six crew members on board), says that while the technology has been faultless, Mother Nature has proven to be a challenge. ""When you cross to the south of the planet you always find rain, strong winds and big waves, so we passed all this with lots of patience and humility, because you are always humble against bad weather,"" Le Rouzic explains. In every port, the catamaran and its message has been warmly received. It's hoped the shipping industry -- responsible for 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the United Nations -- embraces this technology the same way the public has. ""One day we won't have any more oil anywhere. Maybe it's in 50,100, 200 years but one day we will have no more oil and we'll have to find another way to live,"" Domjan said. And if Planet Solar completes its mission, the crew says that will be proof that the sun, and solar power, is the answer.","PlanetSolar, the world's largest solar-powered boat stops off in Hong Kong to promote green energy .

"Jackson, Georgia (CNN) -- Troy Davis, whose case drew international attention, was put to death by lethal injection for the 1989 killing of an off-duty police officer in Savannah, Georgia, prison officials announced Wednesday night. Until the very end, Davis maintained his innocence. After he was strapped to the death gurney, he lifted his head to address the family of the slain officer. He told the family of Mark MacPhail that he was not responsible for the officer's death and did not have a gun at the time, according to execution witnesses. Davis said the case merited further investigation, talking fast as officials prepared to give him the lethal cocktail. The execution followed the U.S. Supreme Court's rejection of a stay, allowing the state to proceed. Davis was declared dead at 11:08 p.m. ET. Throughout the day, Davis' lawyers and high-profile supporters had asked the state and various courts to intervene, arguing he did not murder MacPhail in 1989. Davis initially had been scheduled to die by lethal injection at 7 p.m. ET. But the proceeding was delayed more than three hours as the justices pondered a plea filed by his attorney. Several hundred people, most of them opposing the proceeding, gathered outside the state prison in Jackson where Davis, 42, awaited his fate. Others held a vigil in a nearby church. The inmate's sister, Martina Davis-Correia, was among those who held a vigil outside the prison. Before the U.S. Supreme Court's decision, she said officials needed to take more time to examine the case. ""When you are looking at someone's life, you can't press rewind,"" she said. More than 100 officers, many in riot gear, stood guard over the largely-quiet gathering, which featured candles, occasional prayers and songs. ""Tonight the state of Georgia legally lynched an innocent man,"" Davis' lawyer Thomas Ruffin Jr. said. ""Tonight I witnessed something tragic."" Amnesty International condemned the execution in a statement. ""The U.S. justice system was shaken to its core as Georgia executed a person who may well be innocent. Killing a man under this enormous cloud of doubt is horrific and amounts to a catastrophic failure of the justice system,"" Amnesty said. Anneliese MacPhail, the slain officer's mother, said she was relieved and that justice was served. Davis' supporters, who also rallied outside the U.S. Supreme Court building, argued that his conviction was based on the testimony of numerous witnesses who had recanted, including a jailhouse informer who claimed Davis had confessed. ""There's a genuine feeling among people here and across the nation that we're about to do the unthinkable,"" said Isaac Newton Farris Jr., president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. But prosecutors have stood by the conviction and every appeal -- including the last-minute petitions filed Wednesday -- has failed. Davis' supporters cheered and hugged each other when news of the earlier delay reached them. Davis' attorneys started the day by asking a judge in Jackson, where Georgia's death row is located, to halt the proceeding, citing a new analysis they say shows ballistics testimony at his trial was ""inaccurate and misleading."" They also note that a federal judge found in 2010 that a jailhouse informer's testimony that Davis confessed to killing MacPhail was ""patently false"" and that prosecutors knew a key eyewitness account was wrong. ""Clearly, the fact that Mr. Davis' death sentence rests in part on 'patently false' and egregiously inaccurate and misleading testimony, evidence and argument renders the death sentence fundamentally unfair, unreliable and therefore violative of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments,"" his attorneys argued in a motion filed Wednesday morning. That appeal was denied Wednesday afternoon. The state Supreme Court followed suit a short time later, leading his attorneys to turn to the U.S. Supreme Court in the final hour before the execution. Davis has been scheduled to die three times before, most recently in October 2008. That time, the U.S. Supreme Court halted the execution two hours before it was scheduled to take place. This time, Davis declined to request the special last meal offered inmates prior to execution and was offered a standard meal tray: Grilled cheeseburgers, oven-browned potatoes, baked beans, coleslaw, cookies and a grape drink. ""He has continued to insist this is not his last meal,"" said the Rev. Raphael Warnock, the senior pastor at Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church. Pope Benedict, South African anti-apartheid leader Desmond Tutu and former President Jimmy Carter said the execution should have been called off. Amnesty International and the NAACP led efforts to exonerate Davis, and U.N. human rights officials joined those calls Wednesday. ""Not only do we urgently appeal to the government of the United States and the state of Georgia to find a way to stop the scheduled execution, but we believe that serious consideration should be given to commuting the sentence,"" read a joint statement from the U.N. special rapporteurs on arbitrary executions, judicial independence and torture. But the man who originally prosecuted the case, Spencer Lawton, said those who do not believe there is physical evidence in the case are wrong. ""There are two Troy Davis cases,"" Lawton said Tuesday. ""There is the legal case and the public relations case. We have consistently won in court, and consistently lost in the public relations battle."" Since Davis' 1991 trial, seven of the nine witnesses against him have recanted or contradicted their testimony. The U.S. Supreme Court ordered a district court in Savannah to review his claims of innocence in 2009, but District Judge William Moore ruled the following year that the evidence did ""not require the reversal of the jury's judgment."" The parole board rejected a plea for clemency on Tuesday. In Georgia, only the board -- not the governor -- has the right to grant clemency. And a request that Davis be allowed to sit for a polygraph by his attorneys was also rejected by the state Department of Corrections. Davis' supporters argue he was the victim of a rush to judgment by police seeking justice for the death of one of their own, as well as widespread racial prejudice in the criminal justice system. Warnock said several other inmates have been proven innocent in recent years. Supporters argued that the original witnesses who testified against Davis were fearful of police and spoke under duress. Other witnesses also have since come forward with accounts that call Davis' conviction into question, according to his supporters. According to prosecutors, Davis was at a pool party in Savannah when he shot a man, Michael Cooper, wounding him in the face. He then went to a nearby convenience store, where he pistol-whipped a homeless man, Larry Young, who'd just bought a beer, according to accounts of the case. Prosecutors said MacPhail rushed to the scene to help, but Davis shot him three times. They said Davis shot the officer once in the face as he stood over him. A jury convicted Davis on two counts of aggravated assault and one count each of possessing a firearm during a crime, obstructing a law enforcement officer and murder. The murder charge led to the death sentence. Anneliese MacPhail said earlier this week that she didn't begrudge protesters their opinions. But she said they don't understand the facts of the case. ""To them the point is the death penalty. Ninety-nine percent have absolutely no idea who Troy Davis is or who Mark MacPhail was,"" she said. ""They're just following their belief."" CNN's David Mattingly, Vivian Kuo, Bill Mears, Gustavo Valdes and John Murgatroyd contributed to this report.","Inmate tells victim's family he is not guilty .

"(CNN) -- Apple fans -- including co-founder Steve Wozniak -- lined up on Friday morning for a chance to buy the iPhone 4S, the latest in the company's line of ""Jesus Phones,"" which includes many under-the-hood improvements. The lines, which drew thousands, were part exercises in tech commercialism and part homages to Steve Jobs, Apple's other co-founder, who died last week following a battle with pancreatic cancer. In New York, Apple fans created a makeshift memorial to Jobs that included flowers, photos, iPad boxes and apples (as in the fruit). And in Atlanta, some people said they were lining up for the phone in part because of Jobs. ""I wanted it anyway, but (Jobs' death) made me sort of want it more because this is the last one I know he worked on,"" Dwight Hill, from an Atlanta suburb, said of his decision to buy the phone. ""I just hope the company keeps going in the same direction."" About 200 people had lined up in the wee hours of the morning in New York to buy the new phone, which has a faster processor and a ""digital assistant"" that responds to voice commands and talks back to phone owners, answering their questions. Long lines also formed in Asia and Europe as people waited for the phone. In Silicon Valley, California, Wozniak, the Apple co-founder who, along with Jobs, helped create the world's first truly personal computer, sat in an armchair at the front of a line that began forming Thursday afternoon. He tapped on his iPad, sipped Diet Dr. Pepper and took photos with fans while he awaited the phone's release. ""I want to get mine along with the millions of other fans,"" Wozniak said. ""I just want to be able to talk to my phone."" The iPhone 4S initially was panned by critics, who said it was more of a facelift to the iPhone 4 than a new product. The phone's exterior looks the same as its predecessor, but the guts are new. Inside there's a faster A5 dual-core processor, an improved 8 megapixel camera and a voice assistant named Siri, who will respond to voice commands and answer questions. When Brian X. Chen, a tech writer at Wired, tested the phone, he found Siri to be quite the helpful -- and hilarious -- assistant. He published a series of his conversations with Siri. ""Me: 'I'm drunk,' "" he wrote. ""Siri: 'I found a number of cabs fairly close to you.' (Perfect; it didn't dial my ex-girlfriend.)"" Aside from Jobs, Siri seemed to be one of the main draws for people waiting in line for the iPhone 4S. ""I just want the personal assistant,"" said Teresa Sparks, 41, an Atlanta nurse who had been waiting in line for the phone since 4:45 a.m. Scott England, who also waited in an Atlanta line for the phone, teased a friend of his who said he was buying the iPhone 4S because of the camera. Clearly, he said, ""Siri is a big deal,"" not the camera. ""He's got a secretary -- I don't,"" he joked. Becky Waddell, a 33-year-old real-estate agent, also praised Apple's new digital assistant, which is only available on the iPhone 4S, and which has been compared to HAL 9000, Skynet and other fictional computer overlords. ""I love Siri,"" she said. ""We played with it in the store. I know for sure it will make me a safer driver. I don't have to scramble through my phone while I'm driving. If I can talk to it and get answers, it's going to cut out so much time for me."" Plenty of excitement seemed to surround the phone's release. In true Apple-head fashion, two Apple fans in New York said they arrived at the flagship Apple Store 18 days before Friday, and blogged about the experience on a site called iPhoneWhatever, CNNMoney reports. Another person arrived at that store on crutches. ""I got hit by a car and had surgery a few weeks ago. There's tons of metal plates in my foot -- it shattered,"" David Betz, a 26-year-old bartender, told CNNMoney. ""Is it worth it? We'll find out."" Apple CEO Tim Cook helped unveil the 4S last week a day before Jobs' death. Pre-orders of the phone started on October 7 and beat expectations. Apple sold 1 million of the phones in the first 24 hours via its website and carriers AT&T, Verizon and -- for the first time -- Sprint. By comparison, Apple reported 600,000 iPhone 4 pre-orders last year in 24 hours, but that included orders placed with overseas carriers. The iPhone 4S went on sale Friday at all 245 Apple stores in the U.S., in addition to the following countries: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom. The new iPhone will be available in 22 additional countries by the end of October, Apple says. Apple stores and other retailers opened at 8 a.m. Friday. Online orders can be made at Apple's online store as well as on AT&T, Verizon and Sprint's websites. If you were hoping to pre-order now and pick up the phone Friday, you're out of luck. Pre-orders at AT&T, Sprint and Verizon are sold out, and phones ordered through Apple's website may not be delivered for several weeks. All of those brick-and-mortar retail stores also will carry the phone, along with select Apple-approved retailers: Radio Shack, Best Buy, Target and Sam's Club. (Word of warning: Check availability before lining up at one of those third-party sellers. Inventory is limited, and some will be filling pre-orders before selling whatever stock may remain.) Customers who buy the phone at an Apple retail store will be offered free in-store setup service, personalized instruction on how to set up e-mail and download apps. The phone sells for $199 for 16GB of storage, $299 for 32GB and $399 for 64GB, marking the first time an iPhone has had that much memory. It also seems impossible to separate interest in the iPhone 4S with news of Jobs' death last week. Among the legions of Apple's diehard fans, some have taken saying the ""4S"" in the phone's name represents the words ""For Steve."" Although it's virtually impossible that the company would have done that on purpose (the phone's development happened largely when Jobs was still CEO) it speaks both to the long reach of Jobs' legacy and the cult-like devotion that some Apple loyalists feel toward the company and its products. CNN's Mark Milian and Umika Pidaparthy and CNNMoney contributed to this report.","Apple's iPhone 4S goes on sale at 8 a.m. Friday in each time zone .

"(CNN) -- A 22-year-old Kentucky soldier was charged Monday with attempted espionage and communicating military information, allegations that have shocked friends who have described him as a patriotic country boy. The formal charges were issued 10 days after Spc. William Colton Millay of Owensboro, Kentucky, was arrested at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, according to Col. Bill Coppernoll, the public affairs officer at the base. According to news release from the base, issued Monday, Millay ""communicated and transmitted unclassified national defense information to an individual whom he believed was a foreign intelligence agent."" The Army specialist ""believed (this information) could be used to the advantage of a foreign nation."" A charge of failure to obey general regulations stems from an assertion Millay did not ""report multiple contacts with someone he believed to be a foreign intelligence agent."" He is also accused of ""wrongfully concealing and storing two firearms and ammunition in his assigned barracks room."" The military further alleges that Millay ""wrongfully solicited a fellow-service member to obtain classified information and tangible items"" so that they could be given to a foreign intelligence agent, leading to a charge of solicitation. He is also charged with making false statements, having allegedly not been forthright in telling Army counterintelligence officials ""the full scope"" of his attempted contacts with other governments and ""the full nature"" of what he'd disclosed to the believed-to-be foreign agent. Military authorities did not disclose what information specifically Millay allegedly obtained and disclosed, but they described it as not classified. Nor did they state which country he believed that information was going to, via a ""foreign intelligence agent."" Yet last week, FBI spokesman Eric Gonzalez said that it did not involve any actual transfer of information, via the Internet or otherwise. ""Millay was being observed well before any damage could have occurred,"" Gonzalez said. He denied that Millay's case had any connection to that of Bradley Manning, the Army private suspected of leaking classified information to the website WikiLeaks. Having enlisted in the Army in November 2007, Millay was based in South Korea and Fort Stewart, Georgia, and spent one tour of combat duty in Iraq before being assigned to the Alaska base in May, according to the military release. He was assigned to the 164th Military Police Company, 793rd Military Police Battalion, 2nd Engineer Brigade, known as the ""Arctic Enforcers."" Millay is currently being held at the Anchorage Correctional Complex, according to Monday's military statement. Earlier attempts by CNN to reach the Kentucky native's family have been unsuccessful. Longtime friend Drew Bramschreiber of Owensboro has said that Millay hardly fit the spy persona. ""He's just a simple country boy,"" he said. ""He was never the kind of guy who would get into trouble."" Another friend, Janssen Payne, said last week that Millay idolized his brother, who is also in the Army, and that he had been in the ROTC program in high school. He was a supporter of President George W. Bush and the U.S. war effort in Iraq and Afghanistan, his friend said. ""You've got the wrong guy,"" said Janssen Payne. ""That's just not who he is.""

"(CNN) -- As an 11-year-old boy, Hedi Slimane sought refuge in the school darkroom. Shortly after starting photography classes, the former Dior Homme designer had a key to the lab and would go there to develop photos whenever he could. He may be one of the most influential designers of this century, but it is the camera that continues to fascinate Slimane. Born to a an Italian mother who worked as a seamstress and a Tunisian father, Slimane is credited with transforming the male silhouette when he introduced skinny jeans with a rock 'n' roll edge at the turn of the century. In 2002, he was declared International Designer of the Year by the Council of Fashion Designers of America, previously won by Karl Lagerfeld and Jean-Paul Gaultier. In 2007, Slimane turned his back on fashion, leaving Dior, and returning to photography to take melancholic androgynous images heavily influenced by the British music scene. Today, he shoots for fashion magazines and his subjects have included Lady Gaga, Lindsay Lohan and Robert Pattinson. Now based in Los Angeles, he is photographing California youth culture and has an exhibition opening in November. In an exclusive interview with CNN, Slimane talks about falling in love with photography; his book, ""Anthology of a Decade,"" which follows his journey through fashion, music and the art world; and how the attacks of 9/11 are forever imprinted on to his mind. CNN: What is your first memory of photography? Hedi Slimane: My parents offered me my first camera, a vintage Nikon F and a 50mm lens for my birthday and I developed an exclusive passion for it over the years. Since I was not the most social kid on the block, the camera helped me to express myself, invent my own language -- something like a secret garden. I decided early on I would not write in a diary but take silent photographs instead. This is, of course, what I still had in mind when, in 2007, I started to develop online this idea of a photographic ""diary,"" which later became a format, or definition for some emerging photography blogs. CNN: How would you describe your style? HS: It has not evolved much over the decades. I started as a black-and-white teenage photographer, and I'm still there decades after. In some ways, the genre is almost gone. I am thinking of true, stubborn, lifetime black-and-white photographers, as opposed to black-and-white as a photographic commodity. I presume my work has also always been about reduction -- the subject alone -- without any distraction or after effects, outside emotions, or intimacy or complicity with the subject ... The grace of it all and the fragility of it all are the main subject. CNN: Who or what inspires you? HS: Mostly the subject of the photograph, which can be anyone really, coming down the street -- someone that has no idea. ""Heroism"" in photography, just like in a novel, is for everyone. Choosing it, or finding it, is the most difficult thing, really. It is mostly a mere coincidence, or some sort of luck. Besides, I like it to stay very organic, and to remember a personal story behind all my subjects. CNN: What are some of your favorite images from 'Anthology of a Decade?' HS: I'm so personally attached to all the characters I met and photographed over the years ... the anthology is like a photographic reliquary that could potentially preserve their grace, fierce joy, and restlessness. Some of them, like Amy Winehouse, are so sadly already gone. CNN: Your photography documents the European music scene, the New York art scene and global street fashion. How are music, art and fashion interconnected in your eyes? HS: Music, since the 1950s and the birth of the concept of the ""youth"" as a social group, has always been a laboratory for new ideas and sub-cultures. Music defines decades, and quite clearly shapes the rhythm, vitality of fashion, attitude and social behaviors. The anthology, just like most of my work, from photography to fashion design, is about and around music. CNN: Your book is a reflection of the past decade. What have the last 10 years been like for you? HS: This decade is certainly the most significant and singular decade ... a decade which has transformed us completely. Tragically, this decade started in 2001, rather than 2000. Together with the rise of the internet, September 11 and its aftermath has changed most of our lives. The anthology and most of its subjects are somehow representative of this decade. The new indie generation in music was born in 2001 and the internet and newborn social networks ended up as an experimental channel for most of the musicians involved in the anthology project. CNN: What is the most enduring image of the last decade for you? HS: September 11, unfortunately. It is interesting to foresee the awakening of the Arab world, and hopefully growing democracy, as the beginning of the new one.

"(CNN) -- The son of a former Iranian Revolutionary Guard commander was found dead in a Dubai hotel room -- with his father's website calling the death ""suspicious,"" though police insisted it was not. Numerous Iranian media on Sunday reported the death of Ahmad Rezaie inside Hotel Gloria, a four-star hotel in the coastal United Arab Emirates city. Khalil Ebrahim Al Mansouri, head of the Dubai police's criminal investigations department, said there is no criminal suspicion surrounding the man's death. Al Mansouri, quoting the dead man's brother, added that Ahmad suffered from epilepsy. Yet Tabnak, a website owned by the dead man's father, Mohsen Rezaie, claimed that Ahmad ""was killed under suspicious circumstances."" The same site noted that the death was ""concurrent with the martyrdom of Mohsen Rezaie's comrades in arms"" on Saturday, referring to an explosion at a military base near Tehran. At least 17 people were killed in that incident, after a munitions depot accidentally caught fire, lawmaker Hossein Garousi told state media. Lt. Gen. Ramezan Sharif reiterated Sunday that the blaze was accidental and dismissed the possibility of sabotage. The Tabnak report did not elaborate on what connection, if any, existed between Ahmad Rezaie's death and the deadly explosion. Shahram Gilabadi -- a spokesman for Iran's Expediency Council, of which Mohsen Rezaie is secretary -- told Tabnak, ""The death is currently being investigated."" The semi-official Mehrs News Agency reported that Ahmad Rezaie died from an electric shock. Mohsen Rezaie served for years as head of Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard. In 2009, he ran -- unsuccessfully -- as a conservative candidate along with others against incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. He continues to play a leading role with the Expediency Council, which mediates between the parliament and the non-elected Guardian Council led by Ayatollah Khamenei.","Ahmad Rezaie was found dead inside his Hotel Gloria hotel room .

"(CNN) -- Name: Kevin Evans . Weight in January 1994: 315 pounds . Current weight: 215 pounds . Size change: Size 40 to size 32 pants. History: Evans never took his weight into consideration growing up. He said it wasn't really a problem until he reached college. ""I've always had my baby fat, but as I got to college I started gaining more,"" he said. ""After college, it continued. After graduate school, it continued."" Evans said he was unaware of the toll the additional weight was taking on his body. His mom, Helen, said she noticed he would become breathless while completing simple tasks, but she said she was too nervous to speak up. ""I was going to say something to him about it, but I didn't want to hurt his feelings,"" she said. ""Aha!"" moment: One foot stepped on a scale. Then the other. Evans, a program specialist at Cook Children's Medical Center in Fort Worth, Texas, waited in anticipation as the number beneath him rose higher. And higher. And higher. It was 315 pounds -- a weight Evans had never dreamed of reaching, but he was forced to accept the indisputable reality that flashed before him. He never wanted to reach 400 pounds. It was time for a change, he said. Have you lost weight? Tell us about your ''Aha!'' moment on iReport . How he did it: Evans purchased a treadmill to ensure he had access to workout equipment at all times without limiting himself to going to the gym or facing days of bad weather. He started doing cardio for 45 minutes, five days a week. The treadmill came with an eight-week plan for low-calorie meals that he could prepare. He stayed focused on the program by keeping the price of the treadmill in mind: $1,200. ""I would focus on how much I paid for the treadmill and for that not to be wasted,"" he said. ""I was giving myself one chance to prove myself to myself."" Biggest obstacle: Evans said his biggest obstacle was managing his time. When he changed his diet, he included several items that he didn't usually eat, and working them into his daily routine initially was a challenge. He decided to sit down on Sundays and plan his workouts and meals for the week, including when he would prepare food. Maintaining diet: While dieting, Evan aimed to eat 1,800 calories a day. Now Evans eats five meals a day, with calorie counts totaling 2,500. Some of the items on his regimen include protein shakes, eggs, turkey, almonds, baked chicken breast and steamed veggies. Maintaining workouts: Evans does 20 minutes of cardio five days a week. He runs intervals for 10 minutes and then does 10 minutes of another aerobic activity such as the StairMaster or a rowing machine. Notes of success: His mother said she has seen a distinct change in him, and she said she is proud of her youngest son's accomplishments. ""I think he takes more pride in himself,"" she said. ""I'm proud that Kevin is taking charge of his health."" Final thoughts: ""You can't just go on a diet for a few months and lose weight and then go back to exactly how you were living before and expect everything to be the same,"" Evans said. ""Ironically, it seems like the older I get, the better I get. I am also more self-confident and proud that I have been able to accomplish this."" Doctor's take: Talking to loved ones about their weight can be hard. Dr. Jan McBarron, who is certified by the American Board of Bariatric Medicine, suggests approaching a friend or family member from a nonaccusatory standpoint by asking questions such as, ""How do you feel about your weight?"" Then, if he or she seems ready to change, offer to help find credible sources for weight loss information.","Kevin Evans bought a treadmill and started working out 45 minutes a day .

"(CNN) -- Over the course of two days, 10.5 million people spent four hours watching Kim Kardashian and NBA player Kris Humphries tie the knot. Since the couple's E! special, ""Kim's Fairytale Wedding,"" which aired on October 9 and 10, the pair has honeymooned in Europe, celebrated Kardashian's 31st birthday in Las Vegas, filmed a new season of ""Kourtney & Kim Take New York"" and filed for divorce. Citing irreconcilable differences, according to court documents from Los Angeles Superior Court, Kardashian filed for divorce from her husband of 72 days on Monday. Please take this time to pick your jaws up off the floor. Wait, you're not surprised? Most people probably saw this coming, said Jared Shapiro, executive editor at Life & Style Weekly. ""Anyone that saw the wedding and the time leading up to it ... there was an 'Oh boy, what's she getting herself into?' "" Shapiro said. ""I don't think people are surprised that there was trouble and that it ended. But I don't think people expected it to end this fast."" ""Kim's Fairytale Wedding"" -- an appropriate title, as ""Kim's Fairytale Marriage"" would miss something in syndication -- certainly didn't skimp on the drama. If the couple was trying to display how in love they were to the world, they fell a little short. CNN.com readers react to the divorce news . The special showed the couple arguing over everything from seating charts and desserts to who would perform at their wedding (singer Robin Thicke beat out Christina Aguilera.) Not to mention the blowout that ensued when Kardashian told Humphries she wasn't taking his name. They probably didn't go through every detail that should be discussed before a wedding, Shapiro said, noting that some media outlets are reporting the couple couldn't agree on a place to live. ""I have to be in L.A. for work and (Humphries) loves to go to Minnesota and he also has a place in Miami,"" Kardashian told People in September. ""I think we'll kind of figure it out as we go along."" ""That's why you have a relationship, then an engagement, then a marriage,"" Shapiro added. ""Celebrities often call their engagements off, too. That didn't happen. The fact that it was being filmed for TV might have accelerated all their problems."" Face it: If a couple can't compromise on what desserts to have at their wedding, how are they supposed to settle on a place to live? And let's not forget about the mustache Humphries grew before the big day to prove he still had control over his life. (He ended up shaving it before walking down the aisle.) Of course, it's impossible to discount the role editing plays in reality shows like this one. However, why would E! be hell-bent on making sure Kardashian and her future hubby looked completely discontented with one another? So what does it come down to? ""Kim wanted to get married and be a wife and a bride,"" said Mike Walters, a news manager at TMZ. ""But did that trump, 'I want to marry Kris and be his wife?' "" ""After all the wedding hoopla ended,"" Walters added, ""they realized they're not good for each other."" Read Narcissists want weddings, not marriage . But, Walters and Life & Style's Shapiro agree, sham isn't the right word to describe the pair's short-lived union. ""Guess what, she really got married and she really got divorced,"" Shapiro said. ""This part wasn't scripted. ... She didn't want to get divorced in front of the whole world. What about the people who gave them wedding gifts? ... This isn't a game she played. She tried to make it work. It didn't. She pulled the trigger."" On the flip side, when Khloe Kardashian wed Lamar Odom after one month, some people assumed their marriage was just a publicity stunt. Now, two years later, the couple is still together. Ironically, or not, their relationship was even questioned by Humphries during ""Kim's Fairytale Wedding"" special. Seventy-two days of marriage might yield a one-hour divorce special, Walters said, but, ""How much great TV would they have gotten if Kim and Kris had moved to Minnesota, not liked it, moved back to L.A.? ... This could have been something they played out for months."" Walters, who said Kardashian and Humphries were ""100% genuine,"" joked, ""If this was made up for the show, they could have done it a lot better.""","Kardashian files for divorce from her husband of 72 days on Monday .

"(CNN) -- Former captain Ricky Ponting insists he can still be a key player for Australia after becoming the third cricketer to score 13,000 Test runs on the opening day of the fourth and final match against India. Doubts were raised about Ponting's international future when he stood down as skipper early last year, but the 37-year-old has now scored two centuries in this series after a barren run with the bat. With Australia holding a 3-0 lead going into the Adelaide match, the tourists are facing a whitewash after Ponting and his successor Michael Clarke put on a record-breaking 252 runs on Tuesday. Ponting was on 137 and Clarke 140 at stumps as Australia reached 335-3 in hot conditions, breaking their own record for the fourth wicket against India at the venue. Ponting joined Indian opponents Sachin Tendulkar (15,432) and Rahul Dravid (13,262) as the only players to have passed the 13,000 milestone, ending the day 56 runs past that mark. It was his 41st Test century, putting him level with South Africa's second-placed Jacques Kallis and 10 behind Tendulkar. ""Am I still the player I was? I'm not sure,"" Ponting told reporters. ""You guys can answer that, you've seen me over a long period of time, but at the end of the day I think if I can keep making Test match hundreds or having an impact on winning games for Australia, then that's what I'm all about at the moment. ""It is interesting to ask the same question about Sachin or Dravid or Kallis, the guys the same sort of age as me that are still out there playing Test cricket. ""We've probably all realized that we can't play the same way forever, right through our careers, and I don't think there's been anybody that has been able to do that through 160 Test matches. ""But I'm giving it my best shot to be the best player I can be, and to win games for Australia, and if I can keep playing like I did today then hopefully there's more runs around the corner."" Ponting scored 134 in Australia's innings victory in the second Test in Sydney, where Clarke posted an unbeaten 329 as they added 288 together. ""I felt I played better today than I did in Sydney as well, probably a better wicket to bat on than Sydney was -- there wasn't much in it for the Indian bowlers, no sideways movement for the quicks, not a lot of spin, a little bit of reverse swing during the middle of the day,"" Ponting said. He revealed he has adapted to his new role at No. 4, having dropped down a spot in the order. ""I know my place in the team, Michael's the leader now and I've stepped back from all that responsibility I once had,"" Ponting said. ""The last couple of years being the captain and batting at three was getting more and more difficult for me. Not being the captain now and having that little bit of extra time between change of innings to sit back and relax and take it all in has probably been good for me.""","Australia batsman Ricky Ponting scores his 41st Test century and passes 13,000 runs .

"(CNN) -- A manhunt is under way in New Jersey as multiple law enforcement agencies search for Arthur E. Morgan III, who is wanted for questioning in the death of a two-year-old girl, authorities said. The girl is believed to be Morgan's biological daughter. A group of boys discovered the child's body partially submerged in a stream in Shark River Park in Monmouth County on Tuesday afternoon, officials said. She was still strapped in her car seat, CNN afffiliate WABC reported. The stream runs directly beneath an overpass, suggesting the child and car seat were thrown from the overpass, said county prosecutor Christopher Gramiccioni. Morgan was supposed to return the child to her mother Monday night following a custody visit, Gramiccioni. When he failed to return the child, prosecutors in Ocean County charged him with endangering the welfare of a child and interfering with child custody Tuesday morning. The child was found dead some 20 hours later, WABC reported. A number of federal and state agencies, including the FBI, are involved in the search, suggesting Morgan may try to leave New Jersey where he and the child's mother live separately, Gramiccioni said.","Arthur E.

"(CNN) -- The Philippine government said Tuesday that fresh rain in Visayas and Mindanao could set off flash floods and landslides, bringing the potential for more misery in places already struggling to recover from a deadly tropical storm. Eastern Luzon will experience cloudy skies with scattered rain, while the rest of the island will have mostly cloudy skies with light rain, the Philippine National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) predicted. On Tuesday, the national government offered a new death toll -- 1,453 -- then revised it again based on a count by Regional Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. The lower count means the death toll from the storm that lashed the southern Philippines more than a week remained unchanged from Monday: 1,249. The bodies of people swept out to sea by flash floods from the storm have washed up on nearby beaches and islands, Maj. Reynaldo Balido, the military assistant for operations at the Office of Civil Defense, said Monday. The authorities have enlisted the help of local fishermen to help the continuing search and rescue efforts for the scores of people who remain missing, Balido said by telephone from the island of Mindanao, the scene of the worst devastation. He added that the fishermen volunteered, since many of them had lost friends and relatives in the disaster. The unusually heavy rains of Tropical Storm Washi, which churned across the southern Philippines between December 16 and 18, resulted in landslides and flash floods that swept away whole villages. The authorities have had to carry out mass burials in order to deal with the large numbers of dead. ""I've gone through many disasters but this one is the worst as some of the survivors have lost so many family members,"" said Richard Gordon, chairman of the Philippine Red Cross. ""Some have lost as many as 30 relatives,"" he said in comments posted recently on the organization's website. The number of people injured as a result of the storm has more than doubled to 4,594 from 1,979 at the weekend, according to the NDRRMC putting more pressure on already stretched relief agencies . The United Nations said last week that the storm has created ""huge"" humanitarian needs in the region. It has made an appeal to raise $28 million to deal with the immediate problems, with tens of thousands of people displaced in and around the port cities of Iligan and Cagayan de Oro. Many people are lacking food, shelter and clean drinking water, the United Nations said. ""We have also established make-shift camps and relief centers for victims in local schools in the area, but because schools are opening on January 3, we are looking to find them more permanent shelter,"" Benito Ramos, head of the NDRRMC, said. The storm, known locally as Sendong, has affected more than 700,000 people in the region, the NDRRMC estimated Tuesday. President Benigno Aquino of the Philippines has declared a state of national calamity following the storm. CNN's Jethro Mullen and Aliza Kassim contributed to this report.","NEW: The government revises the death toll, based on a regional count .

"(CNN) -- An armed airman who allegedly barricaded himself inside a building on a Colorado air base is awaiting sentencing on unrelated charges and will likely face additional charges, the base said Tuesday. Airman 1st Class Nico Cruz Santos, 21, surrendered to authorities late Monday night after an hours-long standoff with authorities at Schriever Air Force Base. No one was injured. ""While there are lessons to be learned from every situation, by and large yesterday's incident was resolved with the best possible outcome,"" said Col. James Ross, 50th Space Wing commander, in a Tuesday statement. ""Our law enforcement and community partners worked together to ensure the security of our mission and people while helping this airman through a troubling situation."" The airman -- who belongs to the base's 50th Security Forces Squadron -- locked himself around 10 a.m. inside a building where personnel get paperwork and equipment before being deployed, said Lt. Marie Denson, a spokeswoman at the Colorado Springs base. Soon thereafter, that building and the surrounding area was evacuated. Law enforcement units and other first responders from the Schriever base, nearby Peterson Air Force Base and the El Paso County, Colorado, Sheriff's Office SWAT team rushed to the scene, Lt. Col. Harold Hoang said. The man was armed with a personal handgun, authorities said. He also had his cell phone, which he had been using -- along with a land-line phone -- to communicate with military officials outside. Mental health professionals were also on site, Denson said. The airman ""is currently facing legal action in a civilian court as well as disciplinary action and possible discharge from the Air Force,"" Hoang said. The base said in a statement Tuesday that Santos is awaiting sentencing in Gilpin County on unrelated charges earlier this year. ""It is expected that once the investigation of yesterday's incident is complete that additional charges may be filed in either the military or civilian court systems,"" the statement said. The incident remained under investigation Tuesday. Santos was being held in a Teller County detention facility, the base said. Schriever Air Force Base is also home to the Space Innovation and Development Center, the Missile Defense Agency, 310th Space Wing and other units and groups, according to its website. CNN's Larry Shaughnessy, Greg Botelho and Ashley Hayes contributed to this report.","NEW: Charges are expected against Airman 1st Class Nico Cruz Santos .

"(CNN) -- Occupy activists and law enforcement authorities found themselves at odds in several U.S. cities over the weekend, including yet another tense showdown late Sunday afternoon in Portland, Oregon. Police in riot gear and holding batons lined up for hours along a city street, face-to-face with activists who refused to clear the road and go onto the sidewalk. This confrontation came hours after Portland police Sgt. Pete Simpson said more than a dozen people were arrested as authorities cleared Chapman Square, the last city park where protesters had gathered. Simpson said the officers were in riot gear as a precaution, and were joined by other assisting agencies. ""We needed the manpower because we used up a lot of resources yesterday (Saturday),"" he said. Mayor Sam Adams said late Sunday afternoon that ""a series of increased drug overdoses... an arsonist that used the camp as camouflage and almost a 20% increase in crime surrounding the encampment"" prompted the move. ""All of us are working really hard at keeping the peace and protecting freedom of expression,"" Adams told CNN. ""I support a lot of what the encampment stands for ... (But) it shouldn't be focused on port-a-potties and tents and encampments attracting criminal elements. I think this movement needs to evolve."" Kari Koch, one of the activists, told CNN that she was ""extremely disappointed that the mayor chose to crack down on these parks when the outpouring of support (among area residents) has been so strong."" ""Homeless people exist, drug addicts exist, mentally ill people exist. We were a safe place they could go, and that created some problems,"" she said. ""And we were working to deal with those problems, and the mayor cut us off."" Video from earlier showed authorities dismantling tents at the camp. Once the parks -- which Simpson said are ""pretty beat up"" -- are cleared, temporary fencing will be erected so repairs can be made. One officer was struck in the leg earlier Sunday by a projectile thrown from a crowd, and was taken to a hospital, but the injuries were not life-threatening, authorities said. One protester was arrested in a separate incident overnight, Simpson said. Video from that scene showed masses of protesters -- about 7,000, according to Koch -- on downtown streets. In the early-morning hours Sunday, police told demonstrators to leave the streets or face arrest. All but two of the demonstrators followed that order, many retreating to several parks, CNN affiliate KGW reported. Yet hundreds returned by early Sunday morning -- some of whom have not been affiliated with the Occupy movement until now -- apparently hoping to witness a police confrontation, police Lt. Robert King said. On Sunday, Mayor Sam Adams praised police for showing professionalism and restraint, noting the lack of serious injuries incurred over several police actions and stressing a calm, well-communicated approach. ""I'm prioritizing patience,"" he said earlier in the day. ""In order for us to do this peacefully, we need the time and folks on the ground need the time to do their work right."" In Denver, meanwhile, two police officers were injured and two Occupy activists were arrested late Sunday afternoon, according to a statement from that Colorado city's police department. Protesters became upset when police began removing a food table from a park, some of them surrounding a police car. One woman then pushed a Denver police officer, according to the police statement. She and a male who came to her aid were arrested. One officer twisted his knee, while another was treated and released from an area hospital after being hit in the head, police said. This scuffle took place after, on Saturday night, police in riot gear arrested 17 people as they cleared furniture and tents from an Occupy encampment near the city's civic center, police spokesman Sonny Jackson told CNN. The main issue, he said, was that the items were blocking a right of way. ""People are welcome to come back and protest, but we don't want them to do it in a way that's not safe,"" Jackson said. What started as the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York in September has spread across major cities worldwide as a call to action against unequal distribution of wealth. In Philadelphia, Mayor Michael Nutter said Sunday he was increasing police presence near the Occupy Philly camp and asking the city's police commissioner to ""establish structures and strategic positioning and deployment of officers on a regular basis in that location."" What began as a peaceful protest 39 days ago has given way to increasing public safety and public health concerns, Nutter told reporters. ""Occupy Philly has changed,"" he said at a noon press conference. ""We're seeing serious health and safety issues playing out on an almost daily basis... The people of Occupy Philly have also changed and their intentions have changed. And all of this is not good for Philadelphia."" A woman reported she was sexually assaulted Saturday night in a tent at the encampment, Nutter said. CNN affiliate WPVI reported a suspect was arrested in the alleged assault. In addition, there is the threat of fire near historic City Hall and concerns about litter, public urination, defecation and graffiti, according to the mayor. Numerous reports of thefts and assaults in the encampment have been made, and 15 emergency medical runs were made between October 6 and November 11, he said. Also, a maintenance project is set to begin soon on City Hall, one of several, he said. A $50 million renovation is planned for Dilworth Plaza, where protesters have camped. Occupy Philly's general assembly voted Friday night not to move from the plaza, and members have not responded in recent weeks to expressions of concern from the city, which has repeatedly tried to work with the protesters, he said. ""Many of the people that we talked to in the beginning of this event and activity are now gone,"" he said. ""We have things we need to do,"" Nutter said. ""I understand that they have things on their mind as Americans and wish to express their free speech. I understand that, I get that, I've defended that. The things we're talking about, the activities that are going on, are not about free speech. They're public health and public safety concerns that have nothing to do with Wall Street and corporations."" The protesters are ""purposely standing in the way of nearly 1,000 jobs for Philadelphians at a time of high unemployment,"" Nutter said. ""They are blocking Philadelphians from taking care of their families."" ""Misconduct is not about free speech,"" the mayor said, ""and the behavior we're now seeing is running squarely into the needs of our city government that also represents the 99%. As mayor of the city of Philadelphia, I represent the 99% also."" Meanwhile, in Salt Lake City, police said on Twitter 19 people were arrested Saturday night as authorities moved in to clear an Occupy Salt Lake encampment at a downtown park. Police had ordered protesters to leave the park after a man was found dead late Thursday night. The cause of death was thought to be carbon monoxide poisoning and a drug overdose, CNN affiliate KSTU reported. ""We can no longer tolerate individuals camping on our streets,"" Salt Lake City Police Chief Chris Burbank told reporters. However, ""only camping is over,"" Salt Lake City Mayor Ralph Becker's office said on Twitter -- protests can continue at the park. KSTU reported authorities said protesters would be allowed to have a 24-hour presence and one building, but the tents had to go. Since camping began at the park, Becker's office said in the statement, ""local law enforcement has responded to a dramatically increased amount of criminal activity in the park, and has made over 90 arrests in the area since early October."" A melee involving 30 people on Wednesday night led to four arrests, Becker's office said, and public safety ""has become increasingly questionable. Additionally, the amount of human and animal waste, as well as drug paraphernalia, is an escalating public concern."" As police moved in Saturday evening, according to video from the scene, protesters chanted, ""This is what a police state looks like."" ""Our rights to assembly, which are embodied in the First Amendment, are still being violated,"" protester Jesse Fruhwirth told KSTU. ""Our forefathers are speaking to us, telling us that this is what assembly looks like. Not being able to camp here severely limits the ability of us to keep our coalition together."" ""Many thanks to all for a peaceful resolution,"" Salt Lake City police tweeted late Saturday. In Oakland, California, police issued a third notice for demonstrators to vacate city parks on Saturday, police spokeswoman Officer Johnna Watson told CNN. The protesters had not complied with that order, Watson said. A second notice was issued Saturday morning after a fatal shooting near the camp, according to CNN affiliate KCBS. A man in his early 20s was shot Friday. Authorities said one of the suspects has been ""a frequent resident at the encampment over the past several days,"" KCBS said. Also Saturday, 27 protesters were arrested in St. Louis after defying an existing park curfew, authorities said.","NEW: 2 Denver police injured, 2 activists arrested Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Nearly a year ago, a big-budget film crew found itself in a most unlikely setting for a movie shoot. Filming on location in Tunisia at the outbreak of the Arab Spring, the international cast of actors and crew wound up at the center of an uprising that would eventually sweep through the region, toppling governments in its wake. Almost 12 months on from those tumultuous events, Tunisia has had its elections, and the movie -- billed as an Arab epic -- is hitting cinema screens. ""Black Gold"" is an ambitious production that unites Hollywood and Bollywood stars with Arab talent. The story of two tribes fighting over a stretch of desert during the oil boom of the 1930s, it's being billed as the biggest Arab movie since ""Lawrence of Arabia."" Its producers no doubt hope that what's captured on film will live up to the off-screen drama surrounding its creation -- and appeal to Western audiences as well as those in the Middle East. Indian actress Freida Pinto, best known for her role in smash hit ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" plays Princess Lallah. She say she decided to stay in Tunisia when the revolution broke out shortly after filming began, partly as a gesture of solidarity with Tunisians. ""I just felt that if I can just give my support to my Tunisian friends, the ones who I had spent a lot of time with for almost a month, in any possible way, this would be it,"" said the 27-year-old. ""Just stay back and support them and tell them that, you know, things are going to be fine eventually and they just have to fight it out. ""So, I stayed back and it felt great."" French-Algerian actor Tahar Rahim plays a prince at the center of a family battle, forced to choose between traditional values and the new world of opportunity offered by oil. Rahim says he could see a parallel between the film's theme -- the youth fighting against a repressive older order -- and the recent political upheaval. ""This is destiny,"" he said. ""We began the movie weeks before the revolution ... that's strange, the parallel between the movie and the news."" Perhaps best known for his role in 2009's ""A Prophet,"" Rahim rejects his billing as the first Arab actor to lead a Hollywood film, saying that honor belongs to ""Lawrence of Arabia"" star Omar Sharif, who appeared at the film's premiere. Sharif had been offered the role of the Emir Nassib, played in the film by Spanish actor Antonio Banderas, when the idea for ""Black Gold"" was initially floated by Tunisian film-maker Tarek Ben Amar 35 years ago. Ben Amar, the man who persuaded Hollywood directors Steven Spielberg and George Lucas to shoot ""Star Wars"" and ""Indiana Jones"" in his country, said key plot points in the film mirrored political events during the uprising.

""There was some interesting parallels."" French director Jean-Jacques Annaud said he felt in a ""cocoon"" from the drama of the revolution during filming. ""I remember being on the set in Hammamet and being interviewed by CNN and they said 'So, what about the revolution?' I said 'It's strange, I feel here I'm in the '30s, and outside I'm not really sure what's happening.'"" Despite this, he said, the film-makers ""knew that the story in the contemporary world was reflecting the problems we were talking about in the movie. ""So it was very fascinating, and having all my crew, who were Tunisian, being so involved in what was happening in the cities around us, made our movie even more thoughtful and timeless."" Annaud said he had wanted to make the film since he first visited the region 20 years ago and discovered a very different society from what he had been led to expect. ""People didn't really understand this part of the world. They didn't understand the generosity, the hospitality,"" he said. ""I felt very happy and I wanted to make a movie about this part of the world. And I was impatient to do it because I felt something was needed urgently."" English actor Mark Strong said the role of Amar was the second or third Arab character he had played, and he hoped Arab actors would get the same opportunity to play characters from a different background. ""Why shouldn't Arabs get the chance to play whoever they want, whether they are from Algeria, Qatar, whoever (wherever)?"" he said.

"(CNN) -- A 13-year-old Pennsylvania boy is suing a private residential school for discrimination after it refused to admit him because he has HIV, his attorneys said. The eighth grader, whose name wasn't disclosed in a federal lawsuit filed in Philadelphia, alleges that the Milton Hershey School in Hershey, Pennsylvania, ""violated multiple anti-discrimination laws that protect the rights of people with HIV to remain free from unwarranted discrimination."" Chocolate maker Milton S. Hershey and his wife, Catherine, founded the school in 1909. The school provides a cost-free education and coeducational home for pre-kindergarten through 12th grade students who come from a low-income family, the lawsuit said. The youngster sought enrollment last February for this school year, the lawsuit said. The boy is an honor roll student and a student athlete, and his medication of five pills per day and one vitamin wouldn't impact his school schedule, the suit says. Executive director Ronda B. Goldfein of the AIDS Law Project of Pennsylvania, which is representing the boy and his mother, likened the case to Ryan White, who died at age 18 in 1990 and had been expelled from middle school when his HIV diagnosis became widely known. ""Like Ryan White, this young man is a motivated, intelligent kid who poses no health risk to other students, but is being denied an educational opportunity because of ignorance and fear about HIV and AIDS,"" said Goldfein, an attorney for the boy and mother. The suit, filed Wednesday, was timed to coincide with Thursday's World AIDS Day, the law project said. Goldfein told CNN that she was ""stunned that in the third decade of AIDS (Milton Hershey School) still thinks it is too dangerous to admit a student who is HIV positive. It really shows how far we haven't come."" In response, the school said it had been intending to seek a federal court review of its decision denying enrollment to the boy, but the law project ""took the adversarial action of filing a lawsuit against the school,"" said spokeswoman Connie McNamara. ""We believe we made the right, legal decision under the law,"" McNamara told CNN. ""The decision to deny enrollment was a challenging one for us to make. Like all our enrollment decisions, we need to balance our desire to serve the needs of an individual child seeking admission with our obligation to protect the health and safety of all 1,850 children already in our care,"" McNamara added in a statement. McNamara said the case is nothing like Ryan White's. ""Milton Hershey School is not a day school, where students go home to their family at the end of the day. Instead, this is a unique home-like environment, a pre-K -12 residential school where children live in homes with 10-12 other students on our campus 24 hours a day, seven days a week,"" McNamara said. ""In order to protect our children in this unique environment, we cannot accommodate the needs of students with chronic communicable diseases that pose a direct threat to the health and safety of others. The reason is simple. We are serving children, and no child can be assumed to always make responsible decisions which protect the well being of others,"" McNamara said. CNN's Khara Lewin contributed to this report.","Eighth grader with HIV was denied enrollment at Milton Hershey School .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Three of Michael Jackson's brothers settled a lawsuit Monday that they filed last week against a company they alleged ""duped"" them in a deal to sell replicas of jackets worn by the pop icon. The endorsement of the ""Thriller"" and ""Beat It"" jackets was the first involving Michael Jackson's oldest son, Prince, who posed for pictures with his uncles as they autographed the limited-edition jackets last month. ""Marlon, Tito and I created this project as a tribute to our brother Michael and his fans worldwide, and we are very happy that there has been a resolution,"" Jackie Jackson said Monday. The brothers' announcement didn't specify the terms of the settlement. The brothers filed a lawsuit Tuesday alleging the jacket's marketer bounced a check to them for travel expenses and had failed to pay each of the three brothers the $100,000 each for signing the 1,000 leather jackets. ""We spent the last week making sure that everyone is in agreement with this settlement,"" Eric Farber, the attorney for the Jackson brothers, said in announcing the settlement. The Jacksons are looking forward to ""a successful partnership"" in the future with the company, he said. Steeve Bohbot, owner of Connected Internationals Sales, said he was ""relieved to clear up this misunderstanding."" ""We have such an immense respect for the Jackson brothers and Michael's legacy and are pleased to have resolved this situation,"" he said. The Jackson brothers, who recently reunited onstage for a series of concerts, gathered at West Hollywood's Bar Marmont on October 29 to sign the jackets. Prince Jackson, who has previously stayed away from commercial endorsements, joined them at the event, but he did not autograph the jackets. Prince Jackson was not involved in the lawsuit since he was not part of the marketing agreement. It was not disclosed how much he was to be paid to attend and pose with the jackets. Michael Jackson debuted the red ""Beat It"" and red and black ""Thriller"" jackets, designed by Marc Laurent, in 1983. The Jackson brothers signed 500 of each jacket, which are still on sale for $2,350.","Marlon, Tito, Jackie Jackson resolve their dispute with jacket marketer, attorney says .

"(CNN) -- Hip-hop and rap artist Petey Pablo is facing nearly three years in prison after sentencing on a guilty plea of possessing a stolen firearm, according to federal prosecutors. Pablo, whose real name is Moses Barrett, was sentenced Monday in U.S. District Court in New Bern, North Carolina, to 35 months in prison. The sentencing came following a March guilty plea from the 38-year-old performer, who lives in Wake Forest, North Carolina. According to a statement from Thomas G. Walker, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina, Pablo was going through security at Raleigh-Durham International Airport on September 11, 2010, when a loaded semi-automatic 9 mm pistol was found in his bag. Pablo was attempting to board a flight to Los Angeles, the statement said. Federal authorities determined that the pistol had been stolen during a residential burglary in California in 2005. Pablo, who is best known for his songs ""Raise Up"" and ""Freek-a-Leek"" is scheduled to begin serving his sentence in December.","Petey Pablo was stopped at a North Carolina airport last September .

"(CNN) -- Severe turbulence contributed to injuries aboard two flights that landed in Boston, authorities said Sunday. In the first incident, seven people were hurt aboard a JetBlue Airways flight from Puerto Rico to Boston, authorities said. Six of those hurt suffered back or neck injuries, said Boston's Logan Airport spokesman Phil Orlandella. The other suffered from a severe coffee burn. Three of those injured refused medical attention, he added. The aircraft was an Airbus 320 model, flying from San Juan with 130 passengers and five crew members on board. Flight 852 landed in its intended destination of Boston around 10 p.m., about 20 minutes ahead of schedule, according to the airline's website. In the second incident, Lufthansa flight 429 headed from Charlotte, North Carolina, to Munich, Germany, was diverted to Boston with 11 reported injuries due to turbulence. Orlandella did not know the extent of the injuries. There were 245 passengers and 18 crew members on board.

"New York (CNN) -- The American Automobile Association is suing the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey over toll increases that recently went into effect at New York City bridges. AAA of New York and North Jersey filed a complaint in federal court in Manhattan Tuesday, alleging that toll hikes that began on September 18 breach a federal law that requires interstate tolls be set at ""just and reasonable"" rates, according to a statement released by the agency. ""Clearly, drivers are already paying more than their fair share -- and they are doing so at a time when federal, state and local authorities are hard pressed to meet routine road and bridge maintenance needs,"" said Marta Genovese, AAA New York's vice president and counsel in a statement. The lawsuit seeks to stop the toll increases, which affect commuters using the Lincoln and Holland tunnels, the George Washington, Bayonne and Goethals bridges, as well as the Outerbridge Crossing. Port Authority officials responded to the lawsuit in a statement, saying the complaint ""is without merit."" The lawsuit alleges that commuters are footing the bill for the rebuilding of the World Trade Center site, according to AAA's statement. ""The Authority is attempting to burden commuters and travelers with public expenditures that are in no way related to transportation,"" Genovese said in the statement. A Port Authority press release from August attributes the toll increases to ""multiple unprecedented challenges,"" including declining revenues, increased security costs in the wake of September 11 as well as the cost of the World Trade Center rebuilding project. Drivers crossing into Manhattan must now pay $12. E-ZPass holders pay $7.50 during off-peak hours and $9.50 during peak hours. E-ZPass tolls increased $1.50, and all other cars were subject to a $3 uptick. The tolls will continue to increase every December for four years. The AAA suit comes in the wake of another lawsuit aimed at the Port Authority's newly implemented tolls -- this one by New Jersey resident Yoel Weisshaus. Weisshaus, whose income falls below poverty level, filed a civil complaint with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York last week alleging that the toll hikes constitute an abuse of power that violate his rights by unfairly targeting poor commuters.","Complaint says tolls are not ""just and reasonable""

"London (CNN) -- British Foreign Secretary William Hague met a range of Syrian opposition figures Monday, saying London was ""seeking to step up the international pressure on the Assad regime, a regime that has long since lost its legitimacy in the eyes of the wider world."" Syrian President Bashar al-Assad needed to know that ""the rest of the world is talking to the Syrian opposition and we are looking for a different future for Syria,"" Britain's top diplomat said. ""I think the Assad regime will find that more and more governments around the world are willing to work with the opposition,"" Hague said. Hague told the opposition leaders that they needed a ""unified platform and a unified body,"" indicating Britain may hope the various Syrian opposition groups could replicate the Libyan National Transitional Council that brought down Moammar Gadhafi. The Syrians came from two different groups, the Syrian National Council and the National Coordination Body, Hague said. He met with Syrians including SNC chairman Burhan Ghalioum, Ausama Monajed, Nibras al-Fadel, Haytham Manna, Khalaf Dahowd and Rami Abdel Rahman, a source familiar with the meeting said. The source asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation. Syria has faced months of unrest from opponents of al-Assad, and security forces have responded forcefully. The United Nations says more than 3,500 people have died since the uprising began in March. The Arab League has demanded that Syria stop the violence.

"(CNN) -- A big landslide has ripped through a village in a remote area of Papua New Guinea, killing at least 40 people and leaving 20 others missing, authorities said Wednesday.

Bill Yomba, an official at the National Disaster Office said that the agency thought that excavations carried out by Esso Highlands, a division of the oil company ExxonMobil, for a natural gas project could have set off the landslide. ""This is a very huge landslide that covered a 1 kilometer area,"" said Yomba. ""We are still trying to find out the cause but at this stage we believe the gas project run by Esso Highlands Limited was a contributor because they had been digging for limestone in the area.""

"(CNN) -- I've spent the bulk of my career climbing the so-called corporate ladder. As chairman and CEO of Ogilvy and Mather, chairman of J. Walter Thompson, and later as Undersecretary of State to Colin Powell, I've been witness to how power is exercised and how people are chosen for leadership roles in the halls of both corporations and governments. There are now many more talented women to choose from, and yet we women still hold relatively few positions of influence. Even though I was a pioneering woman among a world of men, I think it's harder for women today than it was for me to enter these circles of authority and influence. The men at the top don't know how to appraise women's potential. They do know leadership positions call for a competitive spirit, a fierce resolve and an endless ability to motivate others. These qualities, you'll notice, are not about the work itself; they reflect a person's intrinsic way of approaching the work. The decision makers know how to size up other men on such characteristics but they don't know the inner strengths of women well enough to judge, so they choose the known, the familiar - in other words, another man - to fill the top spots. This is due partly to the politically correct practices, which have done a lot of good, but have also inadvertently created a sense of distance. It has created a scenario where male leaders don't know or recognize these more intangible skills in the women who are moving up, since these relationships can be quite formal - well, more politically correct. It is also because women today, so very articulate, poised, and educated, are not trained to enter the fray. Work can turn personal, raw, aggressive, and unfair, with little promise of applause or proof of performance for the tasks ahead. But handling all of this is synonymous with leadership. These are the terms of engagement, of relationships that go beyond great work skills and flawless logic. Great work skills, by the way, are something at which women excel, but they are too often tempted to hide behind their great work, rather than step out and be counted when situations turn messy and difficult and leadership is needed. Women, of course, do have such potent leadership qualities but they're not sure how to communicate their unique way of being tough and resilient. There is a resistance, almost an air of punishment when women overtly move to persuade or seek to influence or press firmly for unpopular decisions. It is harder for us to show our leadership qualities over our far more approved of ""womanly ways,"" such as being modest and communal. There is a solution. Women have to learn to be leaders on their own terms. Don't misunderstand - I am not talking about expecting companies to become kinder and gentler, or preparing special cushions for women to reign from. We don't need exceptions made for us. Our way is no less fierce or brave or urgent but we do have to learn to unleash all these passions from the true center of who we are. Women must figure out their own unique qualities and let them loose. This is, in my opinion, the most crucial skill missing in working women today. Only when a woman begins to understand who she is from the inside out can she see where her mastery lies. It is a matter of letting everyone know what you believe in and all that you can offer. Though we are acknowledged to be the more verbal sex, we still need to acquire communications skills that include the ability to confront hostile actions, to motivate the disenfranchised, to reveal intensity of purpose and even to express anger. I teach women such things in workshops I call ""The X Factor"" -- the ""X"" being women's potential. We always finish with presentations because life at work is really just one presentation after another. These can come in the form of emails, phone calls, meetings and even speaking from the podium, but they are all opportunities to present yourself. We have found it is very easy for the presenter to disappear behind the charts or within the team. After our sessions, the mantra of the women becomes ""Step out in front of the work."" After watching groups of these talented women refine their presentations in every forum, it is incredibly rewarding to see women who had once deferred to their power points, step out in front, exposed and vulnerable but willing to say ""I believe."" This is how a leader presents. When a woman dares to communicate all her unique qualities of leadership to those in charge, she will be tapped to take the lead. I am using the next chapter in my life to help women access this untapped power and to achieve their highest potential. I feel compelled to do it because this kind of handbook isn't one that I've found on the bookshelves or in training courses. And it's a book that I wish I'd had when I first donned my business suit and walked into the big, bad world of marketing. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Charlotte Beers.","Advertising high flyer Charlotte Beers says it has become harder for women to enter circles of influence .

"London (CNN) -- As English has cemented its position as the default language of global business, Anglophone interest in foreign languages has steadily waned. ""We have taken a perverse pride in the fact that we do not speak foreign languages, and we just need to speak louder in English,"" British education secretary Michael Gove lamented to a newspaper last week. His government hopes to reverse a decline in the number of British students sitting a language GCSE - a drop from 444,700 to 273,000 over 12 years - by teaching foreign languages from the age of five. But how much do measures like this stand to benefit English speakers, given the dominance of their language? To an aspiring executive from an English speaking background, does it make sense to spend time acquiring another language when the world is learning yours? Or would you be wiser investing that time in other areas of your career instead? Stephan Chambers, director of the MBA degree at Oxford University's SaÑ—d Business School, said while speaking English was ""almost a precondition for success"" for non-native speakers, a second language was not essential to English speakers. ""But if the question is: 'Is learning a second language an advantage, and is that advantage going to increase?' The answer's got to be yes,"" he said. ""Almost certainly, as the balance of economic power shifts, and as supply chains, sales and deals start happening outside of traditionally the most influential markets."" Which languages? Jocelyn Wyburd, director of the University of Cambridge's Language Centre, said the opportunities presented by emerging BRICS economies and Latin America were making their languages particularly attractive to businesses and students - especially as Europe and North America struggle. In particular, Mandarin (the world's most spoken language) and Spanish (by varying accounts the second- or third-most spoken) are ""beginning to be more important for all of business."" Employees with a portfolio of languages were valued for their ability to build partnerships, and had an advantage in the job market for relationship-focused roles, from deal-making to supply chain development. ""But that's a difficult message to get across, because of the perception that English is the global language, and therefore enough,"" says Wyburd. She frequently sees multilingual Europeans edging out similarly qualified but monolingual Britons for jobs in the United Kingdom. Recent trends in the ever-expanding language tuition market reflect English's strengthening position as the default language of international business. ""The key growing markets for language training are Brazil, China and Mexico, and people in these markets are learning English,"" said Rita Pauls, director of global marketing for language tuition company Berlitz, which has roughly doubled its number of students to 300,000 in 70 countries over the past decade. During that time, English rose from 64% to 72% of their business, while German and French remained stable at 6.5% each, and Spanish at 4%. The only other language to have increased significantly was Mandarin, doubling to 2%. While the Chinese economic success story has propelled interest in Mandarin in schools around the world, the language can appear forbidding - even impenetrable - for those who encounter it in adulthood. Not so, says Dr Eric Thun, lecturer in Chinese business studies at SaÑ—d Business School, who picked up the language from scratch during 18 months of intensive immersion study in his mid-20s. ""Most people thought I was crazy,"" he said, adding that devoting yourself exclusively to language acquisition was the only real way to make inroads. ""It's hard to do as a side pursuit."" But while you might have to temporarily put your career on hold to pick up a language, the trade-off was likely to be worth it in the long run. A language could be an invaluable asset by allowing you to better understand your market and access broader sources of information, said Thun. Mandarin was now as imperative to business success in China as English was in the United States. And, as China had developed into ""a more normal labor market"", language skill was no longer a key to success in itself - a functional specialty was generally needed also. ""Fifteen years ago a foreigner going to China would have a fairly strong advantage just because there wasn't a particularly deep talent pool,"" he said. ""That's completely different now. The bar is much higher."" Finally, though, it's important to remember that attempting to pick up a language for business purposes alone may prove a shortsighted approach. The usefulness of a language in a business sense would rise and fall with unpredictable shifts in the global economy, said Wyburd. ""When I was growing up it never occurred to us to learn Chinese. We were focusing on the languages of Europe, because Europe was our reality. During anybody's lifetime those contexts will change."" Beyond its business applications, however, language acquisition would always have a deeper benefit in enabling the learner to grasp another worldview, and become a more effective communicator in any tongue. ""The more respectful you are of the subtleties of language, the more effective you are as a negotiator or as a manager,"" said Chambers. ""And the more likely you are to be able to take people with you in your projects.""","English is cementing its position as the language of business .
A second language, however, will assist in furthering your career .
Putting your career on hold to learn a language is likely to pay off in the long run ."
"(CNN) -- French Open champion Francesca Schiavone crashed out of Wimbledon in the first round after losing in three sets to unseeded Russian Vera Dushevina. Schiavone of Italy, seeded fifth at the All England Club, went down 6-7 7-5 6-1 to a player who has never been beyond the second round at Wimbledon. It was Schiavone's second straight first round exit since the capture of her first grand slam title at Roland Garros earlier in June. Dushevina, ranked 56, lost the first set but grew in confidence as the match went on, racing into a 5-0 lead in the decider and clinching the victory in two hours, 54 minutes. ""It was a tough match on a different surface with a different feeling,"" Schiavone told reporters. ""But she played very well and I didn't take my chance in the second set."" Who can stop Williams sisters? Elsewhere, Kim Clijsters thrashed unseeded Italian Maria Elena Camerin 6-0 6-3 in her first appearance at Wimbledon since 2006. Clijsters of Belgium, who came out of retirement in 2009, wrapped up the first set in just 24 minutes on Court Two.

Clijsters will next face Croatia's Karolina Sprem, who beat American qualifier Bethanie Mattek-Sands 6-3 6-4. Meanwhile, five-time champion Venus Williams cruised into the second round with a 6-3 6-2 win over Paraguay's Rossana De Los Rios. ""It's good to be back.

"(PEOPLE.com) -- The pivotal sex scene in the new ""Twilight"" film, ""Breaking Dawn -- Part 1"" is so steamy that the MPAA originally gave the film an R rating, according to its star Kristen Stewart, who says even she was shocked by what her character does between the sheets. ""There are two big sex scenes in the two [final] films, and we did them fairly early,"" Stewart, 21, tells the U.K. edition of Glamour. ""It was so weird, it didn't even feel like we were doing a scene within a 'Twilight' film. I was like, 'Bella! What are you doing? Wow! What is happening here?!' It was very surreal."" Off-screen, Stewart's sex life is also of interest, particularly her relationship with ""Twilight"" costar Robert Pattinson, which Glamour describes as ""likely-but-never confirmed-nor-denied."" Though the actress -- who's currently shooting ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" -- certainly isn't a fan of such attention, she seems to take it in stride. ""People can say whatever they want,"" she says, calling the interest ""totally understandable. But when it's personal to you, it's like your life becomes a product, and I'm repelled by that. I don't like to give away gems that people are gonna be like, 'Oh my God!' So I'll always just shrug it off. In fact, I always find it kind of funny, and not just with Rob."" Only 17 when she was first cast as Bella Swan in the ""Twilight"" saga, Stewart says she's finally starting to feel comfortable doing interviews, but that it's ""a fair assessment"" to say she often comes off as shy and nervous in public. ""I was young, not expecting it and trying way too hard to be 'not fake,' "" she says. And as far as the devotion from her fans, Stewart says it's something she can relate to. ""There are definitely people that kind of lose it and get very emotional,"" she says. ""But recently, I met [musician] Jenny Lewis, and I had the most ridiculous experience. I was so embarrassing, I couldn't speak. It was eye-opening, actually."" See the full article at PEOPLE.com. © 2011 People and Time Inc.

"(CNN) -- If you gave most folks the choice between their smartphone and their nondominant hand, many of us would wave a one-palmed goodbye to Mr. Lefty/Righty, weld our iPhones to our wrists and grimly welcome an existence of Terminator-like efficiency. Yup, we're addicted to those little bleating beasts, so much so that we fold them wholly into our workaday lives, blindly committing a cornucopia of social indignities with zero cognizance. Conversely, we look down our noses at those who commit the very same phone faux pas, hypocritically musing over their every social slight. Well, my friends, it's time to stand up and take notice. We're not asking you to wholly throw out the litany of bad habits below (that is entirely impossible, and we will have executed at least four of 10 before the week is out). We merely ask you to be more aware of when you're about to do something that, if done to you, would send you into a frothy fit of rage. The iPhone 4S may be sailing toward us on the wings of fall, but the aforementioned bionic scenario is still a ways off (we hope). Let's all try not to do these: . 1). Walking while texting . We know that Harold totally needs to know that you'll be 15 minutes late to his '70s-themed fondue party (because you had a polyester-induced wardrobe crisis), but we're pretty sure that the owner of that baby carriage that you upended in your fervor to alert H. doesn't give a fig about your sartorial issues. And that kid's later-life bed-wetting will be completely your fault. 2). Pulling out the phone at the dinner table . Or pulling out the phone (for any extended period of time) during any social situation, really. Yeah, we know that the notion of beating your brother-in-law at Words With Friends has been haunting your very dreams, but your friend/family member/other of varying degrees of significance is probably much more interesting. If that is not, in fact, the case, consider hanging with your brother-in-law instead. 3). Returning a call with a text . Unless you're in a movie theater, at work or in the middle of an important life moment, said action makes you appear socially awkward. 4). Crop-dusting . It's Friday night and you want to RAGE! Systematically, you scroll through all of your contacts, shooting them nearly identical messages: ""What R U up 2 2nite???"" Whoever answers first -- or whoever answers with the best, most exciting plans (jello shots and football and girls!!!) -- is the winner. And you have won, too! You won the role of ""Flaky Tool"" among your disgruntled friend group. 5). Messenger-pigeoning . You're watching that brand new show starring the unmatchably quirky Zooey Deschanel on Hulu when a pal texts you, asking what time you want to have dinner later. You see the text. You think to yourself, ""7:30..."" You commence watching Zooey dance and twirl. Three hours later, you text back, ""7:30."" And thusly, you have transported humankind from a time of instantaneous communication to an era when we had to wait for rats with wings to deliver fecal-stained parchments across the sea. 6). Drunk dialing/texting . You already lost most of your dignity when you entered that dance contest after slamming five tequila shots. Retain the remainder and give your phone to a friend. 7). Lifecasting in lieu of living . You may have a problem if: your first thought when gazing up at a sun-splashed sky, rippling and luminescent like a melting watercolor, is ""I have to Instagram that"" instead of, ""Oh, pretty sunset."" Similarly: When any semi-intelligent musing becomes worthy of a tweet. 8). Digital dallying . You stopped physically seeing this dude/chick about three weeks ago, but you still text him/her every once in a while (""Whoooaaa, it's like unseasonably warm today!""), you still comment on all of his/her stuff on Facebook and you're currently engaged in a vigorous game of Chess With Friends. You have, in essence, become a DigiPet -- a presence on his/her phone that s/he keeps just barely alive by typing and texting. Very soon, however, your keeper will likely let you die, because you, like a DigiPet, are annoying and useless. 9). Conversations in public . ""Yeah, I do think you should dump him. Cheating is just really, really unforgivable. Also, I mean, you don't want to get crabs, right? Oh... I'm sorry, I thought you were looking for my input, seeing as how you've been sitting next to me at this coffee shop for the last 30 minutes, babbling into your earpiece about STDs. On that note, yeah, I think there's a cream for that."" 10). Taking your phone into the bathroom . We're sad that we even need to include this one.","There are lots of ways to commit social faux pas with you're phone .
Unless you're at work, don't reply to a phone call with a text .

"(CNN) -- International leaders in politics and business are paying tribute Thursday to Apple visionary Steve Jobs, whose death at age 56 has saddened many around the world. ""Steve Jobs transformed the way we work and play; a creative genius who will be sorely missed. Our thoughts are with his family,"" British Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted. French President Nicolas Sarkozy wrote on his Facebook page that Jobs was a great entrepreneur, innovator and major player in the world's technological revolution. ""As inspired as he was inspiring, Steve Jobs will remain one of the great figures of our time,"" Sarkozy said, as he paid tribute to the American's courage in both his work and personal life. Ireland's Prime Minister, or Taoiseach, Enda Kenny also gave his condolences in a statement paying tribute to the man who brought the world the iPod portable music player, the iPhone and the iPad tablet. ""Steve Jobs was a creative genius who broke down walls in business and opened doors in people's minds,"" Kenny said. ""His innovative prowess in the area of technology has brought about a level of access to information for millions that few would have ever foreseen. His legacy will be not just his products and business achievements, but also the way in which he altered mindsets in the business world and in everyday life."" Apple has a large factory in Cork, in the Irish Republic, which opened in 1980 to manufacture the Mac computer. It employs about 1,400 people and has expanded into various aspects of the company's business. In Russia, President Dmitry Medvedev wrote in his Twitter microblog: ""People like Steve Jobs change our world. My sincere condolences to his relatives and all those who appreciated his intelligence and talent."" Medvedev met Jobs during a visit to California's Silicon Valley in June 2010, during which the Apple co-founder told Medvedev about his company and some of its future plans. At the end of their meeting, Jobs presented Medvedev with an iPhone4. Medvedev's chief economic aide, Arkady Dvorkovich, tweeted: ""Applause to Steve Jobs for everything that he did in his not so long life."" German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said Jobs had ""changed our life and work with his ideas and sense for business like few others."" In Egypt, Wael Ghonim -- a former Google executive who used social media to jump-start social change in Egypt -- also honored Jobs via Twitter, saying: ""He was truly inspiring. His company helped change the world. Good bye Steve Jobs."" Masayoshi Son, a Japanese technology entrepreneur and CEO of Softbank, the main Japanese iPhone carrier, said he was saddened by the news of Jobs' death. ""Steve was truly a genius of our time, a man with a rare ability to fuse art and technology,"" he said in a statement. ""In centuries from now, he will be remembered alongside Leonardo da Vinci. His achievements will continue to shine forever."" Dr. Jong-seok Park, president and CEO of LG Electronics Mobile Communications Company in South Korea, offered his thoughts and prayers for Jobs' family. ""Steven Jobs was, and still is, an inspiration to many individuals and companies all over the world,"" he said. ""His passing is a loss to innovators and visionaries everywhere, even here in Korea, and the culture he fostered will be a benchmark for decades to come."" Taiwanese self-made billionaire Terry Gou, founder and chairman of Foxconn Technology Group, which makes many Apple products, said the world had lost a ""true hero"" and he had lost a friend whose dedication to his craft had been shown by his determination to continue working despite being seriously ill. ""True business leaders grow their companies by committing their innovation, creativity, and passion and, while Steve exemplified all of these qualities, he also committed his heart to building a company and products that enriched people's lives,"" Gou said in a statement. ""Steve's spirit will live on forever with those who, like me, had the honor to know and work with him. However, everyone has been touched by his genius and, because of this, he has left the world a better place. He will be missed, but never forgotten."" Foxconn said in a statement that it had lost ""an industry visionary, a true partner to our company, and a great friend."" Jobs ""had an immeasurable and positive impact on the lives of people around the world and the global electronics industry is all the better for the many contributions he made to ensuring that technology is understandable, beautiful, and, most importantly, accessible to people from all walks of life,"" the company said. Working conditions at Foxconn came under scrutiny last year after a rash of suicides at a Foxconn factory in China that makes iPhones. News of Jobs' death prompted immediate tributes from business leaders in China, and Apple fans staged a vigil outside the Apple store in Hong Kong. Yang Yuanqing, the CEO of China's computer powerhouse Lenovo, said: ""As a competitor, he helped ensure all of us pushed even harder. I am confident his legacy will continue to energize the industry for many years to come."" ""Jobs said, 'Remember that you will be dead soon',"" said Lee Kaifu, venture capitalist and founding president of Google China, referring to Jobs' famous 2005 Stanford University commencement speech. ""It helped me through making the most important choices in my life. Because all the glory and pride, embarrassment and fear will all vanish when confronting death."" South Korean electronics maker Samsung also paid tribute to Jobs as a ""great entrepreneur"" in a statement sending condolences to the Jobs family and his colleagues at Apple. ""His innovative spirit and remarkable accomplishments will forever be remembered by people around the world,"" it said. CNN's Maxim Tkachenko, Per Nyberg, Paula Hancocks, Sarita Harilela, Junko Ogura, Zarifmo Aslamshoyeva, Samira Said, Kevin Voigt, Jaime FlorCruz, Xiaoni Chen, Kristie LuStout, Alexis Lai, and journalist Peter Taggart contributed to this report.","NEW: ""A man with a rare ability to fuse art and technology,"" says Masayoshi Son .

"(CNN) -- A New Zealand court denied bail Wednesday to the founder of the shuttered file-sharing site Megaupload, whose extradition is being sought by the U.S. Department of Justice. Kim Dotcom, who is also known as Kim Schmitz, will remain in custody until at least February 22, when an extradition hearing is to be held, the court said. U.S. authorities shut down Megaupload last week and announced indictments against Dotcom and six other people connected to the site, accusing them of operating an ""international organized criminal enterprise responsible for massive worldwide online piracy of copyrighted works."" Four of those charged, including Dotcom, were arrested in New Zealand at the request of the U.S. government. The New Zealand police detained Dotcom, a German citizen, on Friday after a raid on his mansion in the North Shore area of Auckland, the country's largest city. In a packed court on Monday, Dotcom's lawyer, Paul Davison, said that his client is innocent and should be granted bail. ""Mr. Dotcom emphatically denies any criminal misconduct or wrongdoing and denies the existence of any 'mega-conspiracy,'"" Davison told the court. But New Zealand government prosecutors, acting on behalf of U.S. authorities, argued that Dotcom's bail request should be denied because he presented an ""extreme"" flight risk. Dotcom is a resident of New Zealand and Hong Kong. Users of Megaupload -- ranked by the traffic-tracking service Alexa as the world's 72nd-most-visited website before it was taken down -- could share and download files, many of which were copyrighted works made available for download without permission, according to U.S. authorities. They said the operation had generated more than $175 million in illegal profits through advertising revenue and the sale of premium memberships. Authorities have seized the company's servers and domain names and frozen $50 million in assets. Davison said this week that, without access to his assets or travel documents, Dotcom did not present a flight risk. He added that his client wanted to stay in New Zealand with his pregnant wife and children. He criticized the ""aggressive"" approach taken by the police and prosecutors in accusing and detaining Dotcom, saying it had ""amplified the nature and gravity of this alleged offending beyond any reality."" He suggested it had created ""a real misunderstanding and misconception of the business of Megaupload.""

"(CNN) -- Authorities blocked U.S. Sen. Rand Paul at Nashville International Airport on Monday after the Kentucky Republican refused a pat-down at a security checkpoint, his spokeswoman said. Paul told CNN that he went through a scanner at the airport and set off an alarm. He wanted to go through the body scan again instead of getting a pat-down -- claiming that he showed Transportation Security Administration officers his knee and under his socks -- but the agents refused his request, according to the Kentucky senator. ""When an irregularity is found during the TSA screening process, it must be resolved prior to allowing a passenger to proceed to the secure area of the airport,"" TSA spokesman Greg Soule said. ""Passengers who refuse to complete the screening process cannot be granted access to the secure area in order to ensure the safety of others traveling."" The senator said that he didn't think it was ""appropriate"" for him to have a pat-down, adding he should have been able to go through the scanner again. ""Is it too much to ask to have a little dignity when you travel? And shouldn't an adult be able to get back in line and go through the scanner?"" he told CNN. ""I don't think that's too much to ask."" A TSA official said Paul was ""not detained at any point"" and left the checkpoint willingly. The official was not authorized to speak for attribution. Paul said he was ""ejected"" from the screening area and told he may be subject to a ""full body search"" after he began talking on his phone. He was eventually rebooked on another Washington-bound flight, saying that time the screener did not go off when he went through it. ""It tells me that either the machines are inadequate, or they are not telling us the whole story,"" said Paul, insisting that two TSA agents told him that the screeners go off randomly -- an assertion the federal agency denies. One of the most conservative members of the Senate, Paul is an outspoken critic of what he characterizes as an overly obtrusive federal government threatening to strip citizens of various rights and civil liberties. During a Senate hearing with TSA Administrator John Pistole in November, Paul argued that the TSA policy of letting children go through the full-body scanners twice -- rather then be subjected to a pat-down -- should apply to adults as well. He predicted that with such a policy, ""you'll get rid of a lot of the anger and animosity towards the TSA."" On Monday, the senator said he also supported some sort of ""frequent traveler"" program -- so that people who travel often aren't as likely to be subject to pat-downs -- and ""selective risk assessments done on people are international travelers (and) people who have ties to groups that may be terrorists."" He added that someone in the screening area should have ""discretion"" to decide, on a case-by-case basis, if a pat-down is necessary. ""I think we've gone overboard ... I feel that our dignity is compromised, but I don't feel more safe,"" said Paul, noting he spoke with Pistole after the incident Monday. ""Regular, ordinary citizens don't need to be put through this, particularly the frequent travelers."" Rand Paul is the son of libertarian Texas Rep. Ron Paul, a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination. Ron Paul weighed in on the controversy Monday afternoon, calling it an example of a ""police state in this country"" that ""is growing out of control."" ""One of the ultimate embodiments of this (police state) is the TSA that gropes and grabs our children, our seniors, and our loved ones and neighbors with disabilities,"" the congressman said in a written statement. ""The TSA does all of this while doing nothing to keep us safe."" CNN's Alan Silverleib, Aaron Cooper and Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.","NEW: Sen.

"Washington (CNN) -- As portions of the Arab world struggle to extinguish decades of oppression and dictorial rule, the rights and opportunities for women in these societies stand at a delicate precipice, U.S. State Department officials told a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee Wednesday. ""This is not a favor to women, it is not simply a nice thing to do,"" Melanne Verveer, Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues, said at a hearing called to examine the role of women in the aftermath of the Arab Spring. ""No country can get ahead when it leaves half of its people behind,"" and does not allow women an opportunity to participate in the economic development of their societies, she said. Verveer said Tunisia, with its long history of women's rights enshrined in its constitution, and strong middle class shows great promise. With its first election recently since the revolution in which close to a quarter of the seats in Parliament were won by women, Verveer said it would be interesting to see the role women play in pushing the Tunisia forward. On the other hand, Egypt is ""extremely complicated and worrisome,"" Verveer said, with no women included on the committee that drafted Egypt's transitional constitutional declaration, and only one female member serving in the cabinet. Verveer also pointed out that the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces has not appointed any female governors, and said some conservative and political forces are calling for a rollback on women's rights in the more open political environment. Sen. Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, expressed concern for the rights of religious minorities in predominantly Muslim societies. ""Certainly, if women cannot freely worship and are being threatened with murder their human rights are not being duly respected,"" he said, and questioned the role of women in Libya in light of recent calls by Libya's National Transitional Council to enact Islamic law in the country. While Verveer noted the NTC has said they have no intention of establishing an Islamic theocracy, ""vigilance is critical, speaking out against violations is critical"" in ensuring the rights of women and minorities are respected in this time of transition she said. ""This moment of change presents a great strategic opportunity for the United States,"" Deputy Assistant Secretary Tamara Wittes told the committee. With the implementation of democracy and universal rights, Wittes said the rising Arab population of young men and women can push back against the narrative of extremists in their societies. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, R-New Hampshire inquired about but what kind of ""buy in"" the men in Arab Spring countries are giving to equal rights for women? ""It's checkered,"" Verveer said. ""No good cause for women happens without the good men,"" and working with those who understand that unless women are part of the political and economic process, their countries will be set back she said. The United States, which along with states like Iran and Somalia, has yet to ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, should do so, said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California. She said repressive governments could use that fact as a pretext to not live up to their own obligations under it. The U.N.-sponsored treaty has languished in the U.S. Senate since its adoption in 1979.","Senate panel holds hearing on role of women in Arab Spring nations .

"(CNN) -- An outbreak of illness linked to consumption of tainted cantaloupes has been linked to 13 deaths and 72 illnesses in 18 states, a federal disease agency reported Wednesday. The outbreak -- blamed on the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes -- was first reported September 12, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 15 people in four states had been infected. The illnesses were traced to consumption of Rocky Ford cantaloupes grown at Jensen Farms' fields in Granada, Colorado. The deaths reported as of Tuesday morning occurred in Colorado (two), Kansas (one), Maryland (one), Missouri (one), Nebraska (one), New Mexico (four), Oklahoma (one), and Texas (two). The illnesses occurred in those states as well as in California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, North Dakota, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Listeriosis primarily affects older adults, pregnant women, newborns and adults with weakened immune systems, according to the CDC website. Learn more about various types of food poisoning .

"(CNN) -- The Afghan Taliban has rejected U.S. allegations that the Haqqani terrorist network is supported by Pakistan, in an email CNN obtained Wednesday. ""Our bases are not in Pakistan nor do we reside outside of our country in insecure conditions,"" the email sent to Afghan and Pakistani journalists said. ""All military and civilian activities in (Afghanistan) are our own initiatives and our own actions."" The response came less than a week after Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen said that the Haqqani network, which has carried out a number of high-profile terror attacks in the Afghan capital Kabul and elsewhere, acted ""as a veritable arm of Pakistan's intelligence."" Jalaluddin Haqqani, the founder of the militant group, ""only receives orders from their leader, Mullah Omar,"" according to the Taliban email that also said the U.S. allegations are ""baseless."" Meanwhile, Pakistan continued to deny Mullen's charges. ""Very few countries have been ravaged by the monster of terrorism as brutally as Pakistan,"" Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar said in an address this week to the U.N. General Assembly in New York. ""It is Pakistan's firm determination not to allow any space on its territory for militants and terrorists."" Washington's allegations have strained ties between the two countries, which have been in an uneasy alliance in the war against terror since 2001. The relationship between Pakistani intelligence and the Haqqanis goes back to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan when Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United States supported the mujahedeen resistance. Intelligence officials believe Pakistan still regards the Haqqanis as an important tool in countering Indian influence in Afghanistan and helping shape any future peace process in line with Islamabad's priorities. With an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 fighters, the Haqqanis' close relationship with both the Afghan and Pakistan Taliban makes them an important player in the region. Major General Athar Abbas, a spokesman for the Directorate of Inter-Services Intelligence, acknowledged the service has had contacts with the Haqqanis. ""Any intelligence agency would like to maintain contact with whatever opposition group, whatever terrorist organization ... for some positive outcome,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview this month. However, those contacts do not mean that the ISI supports or endorses the organization, he added. Western counterterrorism officials believe that contrary to Pakistan's assertions, the Haqqanis rely on Pakistani territory -- specifically North Waziristan and the Khurram agency -- to organize, resupply and raise funds. The Haqqanis are widely regarded as one of the most effective militant groups in Afghanistan. Western intelligence officials believe the Haqqanis were involved in the assassination this month of the Chairman of Afghanistan's High Peace Council, Burhanuddin Rabbani, and an attack on the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul in June. Rabbani himself alleged that the group that attacked the hotel had been in phone contact with people in the town of Miranshah in the Pakistani territory of North Waziristan, long regarded as a stronghold of the Haqqani network.","The United States says Pakistani intelligence supports the Haqqani terror network .

"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was in Tucson Monday to finish what she started -- a ""Congress on Your Corner"" meeting that was interrupted by gunfire, a shooting rampage that left six people dead and Giffords with a gunshot wound to her head just over a year ago. The meeting came one day after Giffords, 41, announced that she would resign from Congress this week. ""We were invited to finish what we started a year ago. I know that every person amongst us has been waiting for that moment. I told her what I wanted to tell her a year ago, and then I told her how sorry I was that I couldn't really introduce her to Christina,"" said Suzi Hileman, one of the roughly two dozen people invited to attend the private event. Hileman was referring to Christina Green -- her neighbor and the youngest victim of that fateful day. Hileman herself was shot three times in the rampage. ""When I said that Christina would have grown up to be her, she took my hand,"" Hileman said about Giffords. ""She's my hero ... She'll be back and I'll be voting for her."" Two pictures of Giffords' arrival were sent out to the public, one showing her being greeted by supporters at the event. Another, more emotional picture was later tweeted out: It showed Giffords hugging Daniel Hernandez, the staffer credited with saving her life. After the ""Congress on Your Corner"" meeting, the congresswoman toured an area food bank, where she was met with enthusiastic applause. ""A lot has happened over the past year. We cannot change that,"" Giffords says in a video on her website, speaking in a halting manner. She said she will resign to continue her recuperation from the brain injury she suffered when she was shot. ""I don't remember much from that horrible day, but I will never forget the trust you placed in me to be your voice,"" Giffords continues. ""Thank you for your prayers and for giving me time to recover. I have more work to do on my recovery. So to do what is best for Arizona, I will step down this week."" Giffords, a Democrat, will submit a letter of resignation during the week to House Speaker John Boehner and Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer. A senior House GOP leadership aide told CNN that on Wednesday the House will vote on a bill that was one of Giffords' legislative priorities -- a bill to crack down on drug smuggling at the U.S. border that is conducted by smugglers using ultra-light aircraft. The decision to schedule a vote on the measure comes after Giffords' husband, Mark Kelly, spoke to House Majority Leader Eric Cantor over the weekend, the aide said. Kelly called Cantor to say he was ""very appreciative"" of his support over the last year, and mentioned that the border security bill was one of the issues Giffords wanted to address before she resigned. The aide said leaders are now working with Giffords' office on the details, but they are planning to bring the bill up on Wednesday morning before House Democrats head off for their annual legislative retreat. A Senate version of the bill passed last year, but the House has not voted on the issue yet. Gov. Brewer told reporters Sunday that within 72 hours of receiving Giffords' resignation, she expects to call a primary election sometime in April for political parties to pick their candidates for the state's 8th Congressional District seat. That would be followed by a general election -- likely in June, according to the governor. The winner will head to Congress for the rest of Giffords' term, which ends in January 2013. ""Her recovery has been nothing less than a miracle,"" said Brewer. ""Who knows what's going to happen in the next two years? I don't believe we've seen the last of Gabby Giffords."" Before she steps down, Giffords will attend the State of the Union address Tuesday in Washington, her office said. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the Democratic National Committee chair, told CNN that Giffords -- a close friend -- came to the conclusion that she couldn't devote her full energies to both her job and her recovery. The congresswoman's recent return to Tucson for the one-year anniversary of the January 8 shooting showed her ""how challenging it would be. It came into focus then,"" Wasserman Schultz said. ""This decision is really quintessential Gabby Giffords,"" she added. ""She needed to step aside for herself, so that her constituents could get full-time representation. She cares about them so much, that was her No. 1 priority -- taking care of them."" President Barack Obama was effusive in his praise for Giffords, saying she ""embodies the very best of what public service should be."" He added that her ""cheerful presence will be missed in Washington (and) she will remain an inspiration to all whose lives she touched -- myself included."" ""Over the last year, Gabby and her husband Mark have taught us the true meaning of hope in the face of despair, determination in the face of terrible odds, and now -- even after she's come so far -- Gabby shows us what it means to be selfless as well,"" Obama said in a written statement. In her website video posted Sunday, Giffords says her public service career has not ended. ""I will return, and we will work together for Arizona and this great country,"" she says. Earlier this month, Giffords joined thousands for a vigil in Tucson, one of several emotional events to mark one year since the shootings. In addition to those killed, 13 people were wounded in the attack. Giffords' right side remains weak. She has made few public appearances since the incident, with some rare exceptions, such as casting a vote in Congress to raise the federal debt ceiling and conducting an interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer. She has been undergoing intensive rehabilitation in Houston, but returned to Tucson several times, according to her office. Prosecutors accuse Jared Lee Loughner, 23, of carrying out the attack, which purportedly targeted Giffords. Loughner could face the death penalty if convicted on charges of killing six people -- including the chief federal judge of Arizona, John Roll. Loughner has been diagnosed as schizophrenic and has spent time on suicide watch while in custody. He is undergoing treatment in Springfield, Missouri. A federal appeals court in May cleared the way for him to be forcibly medicated, over the objections of Loughner and his attorney. Giffords worked at PricewaterhouseCoopers and as CEO of El Campo Tire, her family's business, before being elected to the Arizona House of Representatives in 2000. Two years later, she became the youngest woman elected to the Arizona State Senate. She won a November 2006 election to Congress, and has won two terms since. Kelly, her husband, is a retired Navy captain and astronaut. CNN's Paul Vercammen, Deirdre Walsh, Tom Cohen and Dana Bash contributed to this report.","NEW: Rep.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Civil rights lawyers demanded the death penalty for former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on Monday, joining prosecutor's calls for him to be executed. ""We merged our voice with the prosecutor's closing arguments from last week's hearing and demanded the death sentence to Mubarak, his former interior minister Habib El Adly, and four of his aides for killing hundreds of protesters and injuring thousands more,"" attorney Khalid Abu Bakr told CNN. ""We have proof Mubarak is directly responsible for the killings along with El Adly and his aides."" Abu Bakr said Mubarak deserved to die for violating Egypt's criminal law 77. ""His negligence and actions led to endangering the national security of the country,"" he said. The attorney also provided the court with a list of alleged suspects he wants indicted, including police officers he said where caught on camera firing their weapons on protesters. Another lawyer, Sameh Ashour, said he provided evidence to the court ""of communication between security forces that prove the presence of snipers on rooftop buildings during the revolution."" The judge, Ahmed Refaat, has set aside Monday and Tuesday to hear from at least 10 civil rights lawyers. The defense is expected to make its closing arguments later in the week. ""The judge will then decide on a day to announce the final verdict,"" said Adel Saeed, the official spokesman of the General Prosecutor's office. ""If he is fast, we may see a verdict before January 25th"" -- the day the Egyptian uprising began last year. Last week, the Russian foreign ministry issued a statement, expressing its ""deep concern"" over the prosecutor's request for a death sentence to Mubarak and calling on Egypt to consider Mubarak's old age and poor health. Germany and France also issued statements of ""concern."" Mubarak is accused of corruption and ordering protesters killed during the country's uprising last year. He has denied the charges. Two of Mubarak's sons are also on trial on a variety of charges. The sons, Gamal and Alaa, have pleaded not guilty. Lawyers familiar with the case said it is unlikely Mubarak and his fellow defendants will receive the death penalty. This is in part because of the difficulty in proving the president ordered the killings, the lawyers said. Analysts agreed that while some Egyptians might welcome a death sentence for Mubarak, particularly at a time of heightened tension as the anniversary of the uprising approaches, he is more likely to receive a prison term. Many Egyptians have criticized the court proceedings and some worry that Mubarak may be acquitted of the murder charges. Five police officers accused of killing protesters already have been acquitted. Amnesty International had estimated more than 840 protesters were killed and 6,000 injured. Saeed, the prosecutor's spokesman, said the prosecutor's estimate of 225 deaths and more than 1,300 injured is lower ""because there has been a differentiation between those killed outside police stations while attacking the precinct and those shot while protesting.""","NEW: ""His negligence and actions"" endangered national security, Bakr says .

"Giglio, Italy (CNN) -- Two more bodies have been recovered from the wreck of the cruise ship Costa Concordia, Italian officials announced Monday, bringing the number of confirmed victims of the accident to 15. The two women were found on Bridge 4, near the ship's Internet cafe, said Franco Gabrielli, the official in charge of the operation. About 17 people remain missing after the ship collided with rocks January 13 off the coast of Tuscany, according to a CNN count. Salvage workers are to begin pumping fuel out of the liner Monday, Gabrielli said. ""Salvage will start any minute,"" Adm. Ilarione Dell'Anna said Monday afternoon. It will take 28 working days to remove all the fuel from the ship, the admiral said. The search for survivors and victims will continue alongside the salvage, said Gabrielli, the head of Italy's civil protection agency. The man in charge of the rescue operation said the divers faced a grim task. ""Imagine that you left for holidays and that the power went off in your house. What would you find in your fridge? The divers are in there,"" Ennio Aquilino said. Two more bodies were found over the weekend -- one woman on Saturday and one on Sunday, both wearing life jackets. Divers used explosives Monday morning to blow more holes in the side of the ship to allow easier access. The parties involved in the rescue told reporters and residents on the island Sunday that search and rescue efforts will continue -- but that the environmental risk is also becoming urgent. Officials said they cannot predict how long it will take to clear the wreckage, since that depends on maritime conditions and technical difficulties, but all legal, environmental and human factors will be taken into account. ""It's time for Italy to show it can do something right and do it well,"" said Gabrielli. Gabrielli warned that the task ahead was complicated and daunting, not least because it takes about 45 minutes to search each cabin, using special cameras and divers. The giant Costa Concordia had 1,500 cabins on board. A class-action lawsuit will be filed in Miami against Costa and its parent company, Carnival Corp., the Italian consumer group Codacons said on Saturday. The suit, in collaboration with two U.S. law firms, is ""aimed specifically at getting compensation for all damages to the boat passengers,"" Codacons said in a statement. The class-action suit is open to passengers of any nationality, it said. ""We've been contacted by hundreds of victims and the numbers are growing moment by moment,"" said Mitchell Proner, senior partner at Proner & Proner, one of two firms involved. He said crew members have also contacted the firm, ""and their stories that are coming in are horrific -- from lifeboats that were stuck halfway, passengers debating whether to jump or not, this was not an orderly evacuation."" The suit, he said, will request at least 125,000 euros (about $160,000) per passenger. The suit has not yet been filed, said Marc Bern, senior partner at the other firm, Napoli Bern Ripka Shkolnik, but ""it will probably be in the billions of euros and dollars."" ""The sheer terror of being on a ship of that magnitude going down, you can imagine the psychological damage,"" Bern said. Gabrielli said no fuel oil had yet leaked from the ship -- only kitchen and engine oil -- and that he did not see an immediate risk of the 2,400 tons on board escaping. Booms have been put in place around the ship to stop the spread of oil and other pollutants such as detergents and sewage chemicals. With more than 4,000 people aboard, the ship was the size of a small town, Gabrielli said. Fuel will be replaced with water as it is removed from the ship's tanks, keeping the ship balanced, said Dell'Anna, head of coastal authorities for the port city of Livorno. Gabrielli said Costa Cruises, the company that owns the cruise ship, is cooperative and was proving responsible, despite past errors. Both Costa Cruises and authorities have criticized Capt. Francesco Schettino, who is under house arrest and faces possible charges of manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning ship. Prosecutors said they planned to appeal the judge's decision to grant Schettino house arrest, arguing that Schettino should remain in jail because he is a flight risk and because of the gravity of his alleged crimes. Alessandro Antichi, partner of Schettino defense attorney Bruno Leporatti, said the defense plans to file its appeal Wednesday on the judge's ruling. The defense maintains Schettino should not be in custody. An audio recording obtained by Italy's Repubblica newspaper and published Saturday shows that the captain, at least at the outset of the incident, assured authorities he would do the right thing. Prosecutors have accused the captain of piloting the ship too fast to allow him to react to dangers, causing the shipwreck, according to legal papers. There were roughly 4,200 people on the Costa Concordia when it ran aground -- about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members. The vast majority fled the ship safely. CNN's Dan Rivers, Livia Borghese, Hada Messia, Marilia Brocchetto, Vivian Kuo and journalist Barbie Nadeau contributed to this report.","NEW: A class-action suit will be filed against the cruise line and its parent company, group says .

"(CNN) -- Millions of BlackBerry users in Europe, the Middle East and Africa were reportedly without Web and texting service Monday because of an outage that BlackBerry maker Research in Motion said it was investigating. ""We apologize to any of our customers in Europe, Middle East & Africa still experiencing issues. We'll bring you an update as soon as we can,"" read the message from @blackberryhelp on Twitter. A statement provided by Research in Motion basically said the same thing. The company did not respond to CNN's questions about the cause of the outage, the number of users affected or an estimate of when service would be restored. London's The Telegraph was reporting that all of the affected areas are served by a data server in Slough in southern England. On its support Twitter feed, T-Mobile UK told customers the outage had knocked out service to ""everyone"" in the affected area and that BlackBerry Messenger and Web service were ""having issues on all networks."" The network told customers it had not been given details about the cause of the outage, but that Research In Motion was looking in to it. Other carriers were telling customers much the same, saying the problem is on BlackBerry's end. ""RIM has advised us that they're working to resolve the issue as a matter of urgency,"" a UK-based Vodafone spokesman told Dow Jones Newswires. The BlackBerry remains hugely popular throughout Europe and the Middle East, where many international business users prize the phones for their vaunted security features. British and European media were counting the number of people affected by Monday's outage in the millions. In July, BlackBerry reported it had added 1 million customers in the Europe, Middle East and Africa market in less than three weeks.","BlackBerry customers in Europe, Africa, Middle East without service .

"(CNN) -- A man matching the description of the suspect in a fatal workplace shooting in Cupertino, California, was killed Thursday morning when he brandished a weapon, authorities said. Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith said positive identification of the man killed in Sunnyvale, a Bay Area city that borders Cupertino, must come through the coroner. But he is believed to be Shareff Allman, who is about 45 years old. CNN affiliate KGO reported the man's first name was spelled Shareef. After SWAT teams canvassed neighborhoods, three deputies on routine patrol found a man crouched beside a vehicle at a residence, Smith said. ""The deputies identified him as the suspect. He did display in a threatening manner a firearm,"" Smith said. All three deputies opened fire, killing him. The suspect died within the perimeter of Wednesday's manhunt, but it was not clear if he spent any time in a home before he was spotted, Smith told reporters. The workplace shooting occurred Wednesday about 4:15 a.m. at the Permanente Quarry, which produces cement products, Smith said. Authorities believe Allman, armed with a handgun and an assault rifle, entered a meeting and opened fire. Two people died at the scene, Smith said, and a third was pronounced dead later at a hospital. Six others were wounded. The motive was still not clear Thursday. Smith described Allman as a ""disgruntled employee."" According to Santa Clara County sheriff's Sgt. Jose Cardoza, witnesses reported the incident lasted ""no more than two minutes."" Allman also was believed to be involved in an attempted carjacking that occurred around 7 a.m. Wednesday on the Hewlett-Packard campus in Cupertino, about five miles away from the quarry, Smith said. A woman was shot and sustained non-life-threatening injuries. The suspect did not obtain the woman's car, the sheriff said. He is believed to have fled on foot. Cardoza said the weapon used in the attempted carjacking was a handgun similar to that used in the workplace shooting. Authorities found Allman's vehicle at a service station close to the site of the attempted carjacking, Smith said. Police recovered two assault rifles, she said. Allman has a ""minor criminal record,"" the sheriff said, with the latest incident in 1996. KGO reported that Allman is a community television host who regularly preaches about nonviolence.","California deputies shoot man believed to be the suspect .

"Cambridge, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Steve Jobs died Wednesday at the age of 56. Within minutes of the announcement, Twitter and other digital channels were flooded with outpourings of grief for a very private man who leaves a very big mark on the world. It is the footprint, not of a manager or philanthropist, but of an entrepreneur. His legacy is that of an individual who used his drive, vision, curiosity and keen intelligence to follow new possibilities relentlessly without being deterred by the obstacles on his path. From the introduction of the first Apple computer in the late 1970s to his ""wilderness years"" at NeXT and Pixar in the late 1980s and early 1990s to his leadership in developing the iPod, iPhone and iPad during the last 10 years at Apple, Jobs turned his energy to creating new offerings that change people's lives. From the get-go, he understood he was living in a moment of far-reaching transformation that we now call the Digital Revolution and that in such a moment, a lot is at stake. Invested with a sense of his importance on a stage where everything from telephony to publishing to music distribution was up for grabs, he knew there was no time to lose in developing powerful, beautiful, engaging products and services. This understanding fueled the relentless pace of innovation at Apple during the last 13 years. (It may also have fed his often severe, controlling and still-inspiring managerial style.) Undoubtedly, the breadth of Jobs' vision steered Apple toward market leadership and a long series of financial home runs. But throughout Jobs' journey, we never thought it was solely -- or even primarily -- about the money. More than 15 years ago, Jobs realized that (what we then called) the Information Revolution was bigger and bolder than groovy products and the convergence of technologies. It was about democratizing all kinds of activity by breaking down barriers in how information is distributed. As he explained to Rolling Stone, this development meant ""individuals can now do things that only large groups of people with lots of money could do before. ... (W)e have much more opportunity for people to get to the marketplace -- not just the marketplace of commerce but the marketplace of ideas. The marketplace of publications, the marketplace of public policy. You name it."" If we think about the role of smartphones in the Arab Spring or the Occupy Wall Street protests, we see just how right Jobs was. This is impact, measured in a deep, lasting way. And this is how ultimately Jobs will be remembered. As an entrepreneur -- like Henry Ford or perhaps Alexander Graham Bell -- whose vision expanded both our sense of individual freedom and connection with each one another. In an uncharacteristically candid speech at Stanford University in 2005, Jobs advised young people to follow their passion and stay foolish and hungry. He did this all his life, and the world will never be the same. Small wonder we grieve today. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nancy F. Koehn.","Nancy Koehn: Steve Jobs is rightly celebrated for products he introduced .

"(CNN) -- It was inevitable that the fiery politics of the death penalty would punctuate Saturday's remembrance of Troy Anthony Davis. His 20 years of claims of innocence on Georgia's death row earned him millions of supporters who believe the state wrongfully executed him on the night of September 21. Saturday, Davis' family and closest friends gathered inside the Jonesville Baptist Church to celebrate his life. A mass of flowers covered Davis' closed casket. Two photos flanked it -- one a color portrait of a young boy who grew up on the streets of Savannah's Cloverdale neighborhood and the other a black and white photo of a young man in a suit attending his murder trial. Those in attendance repeatedly chanted: ""I am Troy Davis,"" the slogan adopted in the campaign to spare his life and one that went viral on social media networks. ""Look at those last two lines of your program today,"" said Benjamin Jealous, president of the NAACP. ""I am Troy Davis. And I am free."" Jealous and other friends and advocates for Davis, including his lawyer, Jason Ewart, voiced Davis' last words before he was put to death by lethal injection. That he was sorry for the family of police Officer Mark MacPhail, but that he was innocent. ""We're going to keep on fighting until his name is finally cleared and Georgia admits what it has done,"" Jealous said. ""We're going to keep on fighting until the death penalty is abolished and this can never be done to anyone else."" MacPhail was shot in the early morning hours of August 19, 1989, in the parking lot of a Burger King just a few miles north of the church where Davis was memorialized. Davis was tried and convicted for MacPhail's murder and sent to death row in 1991. But he and his family had always maintained that the jury convicted the wrong man. The MacPhails said they lived in agony as legal proceedings dragged on year after year. The case became controversial after several of the witnesses who testified against him at trial later said they were coerced to speak against Davis. It was battled in many courtrooms before his execution. But in the end, Davis lost all his appeals. ""We are gathered here in a place of the most unjust execution of mankind,"" Ewart said. ""Jesus was killed on the cross, not because he was guilty, but because we are. ""Many have spoken of Troy as a symbol,"" Ewart said. ""He was the soul of something profound."" Ewart, a young antitrust lawyer signed onto defending Davis shortly after graduating from Emory University's law school in Atlanta. ""I met him seven years ago. When I met him I was young. I was green,"" he said. ""From the very first conversation I had with Troy I knew he could be my older brother, my friend, and eventually, he became just that."" Raphael Warnock, pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, invoked the 1994 book that made Savannah famous. ""It's midnight in the garden of good and evil,"" he said. ""But I am so glad God does his best work at midnight. When the adversary has our backs against the wall, that's when God does his best work. ""Strange things happen in Savannah, Georgia,"" he said. ""This city of cobblestone streets and verdant town squares ... you have become the ground zero for the struggle to abolish the death penalty once and for all. Savannah, Georgia, the world is watching you."" Davis' mother, Virginia, died in April. She was not around to see the execution of her son, an act that would have surely been wretchedly painful to bear. Davis' sisters, Martina Correia and Kimberly Davis, attended the funeral Saturday, as did Correia's son De'Jaun Davis-Correia. Davis-Correia, born prematurely, said his uncle Troy was afraid to hold him when he was first born. He weighed only 3 pounds, 8 ounces. ""He thought he would break me,"" Davis-Correia said. But he grew into a strong young man, he said, through his uncle's guidance. He spoke of how Davis, from death row, used to help his nephew with homework, even put his tests and exams on his calendar. People tell him now that he's a little version of his uncle. And that makes Davis-Correia, the nephew of an executed man, very proud. For all his life, his uncle lived 300 miles away, behind brick walls. But, he said, ""It was always like he was home with us."" The funeral was open to the public, but Davis was to be buried Saturday with only his family at his graveside. And then, just before people began streaming out of the church well into Saturday afternoon, a message recorded by Davis thanked his supporters all over the world for their efforts on his behalf. ""Everything we do today will clear the way for a better tomorrow,"" Davis said. ""We can correct all the wrongs if we band together. Don't give up the fight."" The voice of the dead had filled the sanctuary.","""I am Troy Davis,"" chant those at the funeral .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN)  -- A suspected missile strike from a U.S. Predator drone killed at least four people in a house in Pakistan's North Waziristan region early Saturday. Marchers protest recent U.S. missile strikes on the Pakistani tribal areas. The attack, which occurred in the Mir Ali subdivision in the village of Ali Khel, was one of several to hit the country Saturday. Six people were injured in Saturday's attack, the fourth suspected U.S. strike on Pakistani soil in November. The names of the victims have not been released. It is also not known why the house was targeted. Elsewhere, three people were killed and 11 were injured in an explosion inside a mosque in northwest Pakistan's tribal region, a government official said. The explosion happened just after 4 p.m. (6 a.m. ET), leaving the Hangu district mosque inside Pakistan's North-West Frontier Province in ruins, said Omer Faraz Khan, deputy superintendent of Hangu. He said rescuers were trying to save people trapped under the debris. It was not immediately clear how many people were inside the mosque at the time of the blast. Police were investigating the explosion, which was detonated using a homemade timer, Khan said. Hours later, three bombs exploded about 10 p.m. (noon ET) outside a stadium in Lahore where a music festival was being held, police Inspector Muntzir Kazmi said. A 13-year-old was injured, but it was unknown whether the victim was a boy or girl. This week, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry summoned U.S. Ambassador Anne Patterson to lodge a formal protest against another suspected U.S. missile strike on its territory, an act Pakistan Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani called a violation of his nation's sovereignty.  Watch Gilani say his country has had enough of U.S. attacks » . Wednesday's strike in the Bannu region of Pakistan's North-West Frontier Province left five dead and seven wounded. That attack was farther inside Pakistani territory than previous attacks. The attack targeted a home outside the tribal areas that U.S. intelligence says have become a haven for Taliban and al Qaeda fighters battling U.S. and NATO troops in neighboring Afghanistan. The U.S. government has not acknowledged hitting targets within Pakistan, an ally in the war on al Qaeda launched after the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington. However, Pakistan's government has repeatedly complained about the strikes. Gilani took to the floor of the parliament and renewed his condemnation of the attacks Thursday but added that he thinks they will be controlled when President-elect Barack Obama takes office. In October, the foreign ministry summoned Patterson to lodge a ""strong"" protest on continuing missile attacks and said they should be stopped immediately. At the time, a missile strike from a suspected U.S. drone on a compound in South Waziristan killed 20 people. Pakistan's government said the attacks cost lives and undermine public support for its counterterrorism efforts. The U.S.-led coalition and NATO, based in Afghanistan, have been seeking a way to effectively battle militants who are launching attacks from Pakistan's swath of tribal areas along the border. They have become frustrated with Islamabad over the years, saying it is not being active enough against militants, a claim Pakistan denies. The United States is the only country operating in the region known to have the capability to launch missiles from drones, which are controlled remotely.","NEW: Teen killed when three bombs explode outside music festival .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- Sony plans to release the PlayStation Vita, a portable video game player, on February 22, 2012, in the United States, Canada and Europe, the company announced at a technology conference on Tuesday. The Vita will succeed the PlayStation Portable, or PSP, and PlayStation Go, a smaller version of the hand-held device. The Vita has a touchscreen and a touch-sensitive pad on the back of the device, along with the buttons and control sticks gamers expect to see on controllers. Sony Computer Entertainment CEO Jack Tretton and a Sony spokesman demonstrated a sequel to a popular PlayStation 3 game called ""Uncharted: Golden Abyss."" Players can use the standard controller or manipulate the character using touch controls, as the spokesman showed onstage at the Web 2.0 Summit. The game looks very attractive -- but when shown on the big screen, not as sharp as a console game. Sony previously announced pricing for the Vita, with a version that connects to the Web via Wi-Fi costing $250 and another that has 3G wireless data connectivity for $300. Nintendo made deep price cuts to its portable 3DS system just five months after a strong launch when sales began to slow. Analysts expect Sony will struggle to sell consumers a dedicated hand-held game machine now that smartphones and tablets have become powerful enough to handle powerful games. ""The advent of smartphone gaming is quite additive to what we're trying to accomplish,"" Tretton said. People may look to the Vita when they want to graduate from more simplistic games sold on phones, he said. The Vita will first hit stores on December 17 in Japan, where Sony's portable systems have fared better.","Sony announces a February 22, 2012, release for the PlayStation Vita .

"(CNN) -- It is no secret that President Obama is in a tough fight for re-election. He is correct in describing himself as the underdog at the present time. In an atmosphere of high unemployment, declining incomes, and worldwide financial angst you would be correct in thinking that the Republicans are on the verge of having another big year. In order for the president to win this go-round it is essential that he faces a weak Republican opponent. This opponent would undoubtedly emerge from an equally weak Republican field. Thus far the Republican field of 2012 is a Democratic dream come true. This crop of candidates is not just weak, it is a joke. Now you are saying, ""There goes that crazy Cajun again calling the opposition a joke."" I can hear the men in wool sport coats with suede elbow patches scratching their chins. There is a collective harrumph from the ""it's time to tone down the rhetoric"" crowd of people. Before you condemn my rather provocative adjective in describing the Republican field, please consider the following: . 1. It is undeniably the duty of the opposition party to field a credible slate of candidates for the nation's highest office. It is particularly important that they do so in times of national distress (and this certainly qualifies as such). 2. This situation in modern times is most analogous to the presidential primaries of 1980. To justify my deeming the Republican field an absolute joke I have compiled a list of comparable candidates for your reading pleasure. This battle of rÃ©sumÃ©s proves incredibly entertaining -- feel free to indulge. Lets start at the top by matching up the front-runners: . Mitt Romney vs. Ronald Reagan  -- please hold your laughter because it's only getting funnier from here on out. Reagan stepped up as two-time governor of California who came within an inch of the nomination in 1976. He gave the keynote address at the Republican convention of 1964 and was a longtime consistent conservative for years prior to his running for president for the second time in 1980. Romney is an accomodationist technocrat who is an ideological pretzel of a man. In his four years as governor, Massachusetts ranked 49th in job creation and Katrina saved him from coming in at 50. But hey -- Romney has recently released a 59-point economic plan for recovery. Go ahead and name three of those 59 points -- see, told ya so. I have no idea why that right-wing clown in Dallas is attacking his Mormon faith -- it may be the only thing he really believes in. This one is delicious -- Rick Perry vs. George H. W. Bush. I'm sorry, but Perry is Fred Thompson on steroids. To be clear, Thompson was actually a pretty damn good lawyer who has some intellectual heft to him -- although he hid it rather well in his 2008 race. On the contrary, Perry literally can't string two sentences together. His performance before the Values Voters Summit was universally panned. Perry couldn't give a good speech with all the time in the world to prepare. We are now told the problem is that he doesn't get enough sleep. Break out the Lunesta -- Rick Perry is coming storming back! Note to the Perry campaign: You are supposed to give him the Lunesta after the debate, not before. I know Perry speaks some Spanish but I don't believe ""debate"" translates to ""siesta."" Bush was a war hero, a successful entrepreneur, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, ambassador to the United Nations, U.S. envoy to China, and chairman of the Republican National Committee. George H. W. Bush went on to serve as vice president and president of the United States. Sorry, Rick, I don't see you filling those shoes anytime soon. Let's match up Herman Cain vs Bob Dole. Like George H.W. Bush, Dole was a war hero, a member of the Kansas House of Representatives, elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, became a senator, was selected as a vice-presidential running mate, and chaired the Republican National Committee. He later went on to serve as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senate majority leader, and Senate minority leader. Herman can't even make an edible pizza. Republican or not -- you have to admit, that stuff was pretty bad. Moving on to Michele Bachmann vs. Howard Baker (I'm sorry I couldn't help myself.) Baker served in the U.S. Navy, was elected to the U.S. Senate, was asked to serve on the Supreme Court by Nixon, and served two terms as Senate minority leader. He later received the Presidential Medal of Freedom and inspired the formation of the Howard H. Baker, Jr. Center for Public Policy at the University of Tennessee. Could you see Michele Bachmann being nominated for a Presidential Medal in the near future?! Of course, some people might say, to be fair to Bachmann, Baker has never claimed to cure anyone of homosexuality. I haven't even spoken of former governor of Texas John Connally who, unlike Perry, served as a competent governor, served as both secretary of the Navy and secretary of the Treasury. Even I am getting tired of beating this piÃ±ata of a field. The other Republicans of the presidential primaries of 1980 consisted of Sen. Lowell Weicker of Connecticut, who was a liberal Republican and a rather influential member of the Senate Watergate committee (for those of you over 45 you can remember such a species.) John Anderson, selected as a third-party candidate, went on to gain a significant number of votes in the general election. Phil Crane, a well-respected Republican, was thought to be an articulate promoter of conservative ideology. Harold Stassen would fit in nicely with the current crop of underwhelming candidates sure to disappoint. Ben Fernandez, the former ambassador to Paraguay, was said to be the first Hispanic to run for president. He has escaped my memory much like I'm sure Thaddeus McCotter has escaped your memory by now as well (let the Googling ensue). The two most qualified candidates, Newt Gingrich and Jon Huntsman, can't even get their own party to take them seriously. Jon Huntsman's career can be compared to Lowell Weicker's unsuccessful quest for a presidential nomination. Gingrich's public ethical issues have made him a presidential outcast. Regardless, these three are notoriously marked by their inability to get votes (in their favor that is.) I'll conclude by saying that it may not be appropriate to refer to the Republican slate as a joke. I'm sorry I take it back -- they are, more fittingly, pathetic. In times like this there is nothing wrong with the nation having a good laugh, just as long as it's not at the expense of a major political party. The 1980 field in comparison to 2012 reminds me of the recent LSU vs. Florida game. Not to rub it in but the score was LSU 41- Florida 11.

"Okavango Delta, Northern Botswana (CNN) -- The hot African sun is turning cool and big and a deep soft orange, and the impala are getting mighty jumpy. They ought to be. A half-kilometer across the grassy bush, we're watching a pack of eight African wild dogs, downwind and sniffing a scent, planning their evening hunt. We have a plan, too. We're going to follow them. Not far away, a large herd of zebra also knows this is the most dangerous time. They've pastured all day in a broad, open field, nibbling vegetation. As long as these prey remain in an open area, they are safe, because they can see the predators coming. They can outrun all but the cheetah, and in a large group, the likelihood of any particular individual being caught is lessened. A herd of wildebeest is mingling with the zebra and following them through the tall grass. ""The zebra and the wildebeest, they are friends,"" our guide, 46-year old, bush-born Botswanan Kgotla ""Balepi"" Mokwami of Kwara Camp, tells me. ""The zebra have short necks, but the wildebeest, they have long necks. So the zebras' heads are high and they can see above the grass and they tramp it down low enough so the wildebeest, whose heads are low, can see too."" If you go: Visiting the Okavango Delta . It's like the baboons and the impala, Mokwami explains. Earlier, we watched impala graze near a family of baboons, with one baboon sitting on a stump, keeping watch for lion, cheetah and leopard. If the baboon detects danger, the impala will know, too. But now the night approaches, and the darkness will neutralize the prey's advantage. They must head for the shrubs and trees to hide. But they know that is where the predators sit in wait. This just might be their time to die. We have come here to Kwara Concession, a 170,000-hectare private reserve deep in the world's largest inland delta, Botswana's famed Okavango. Thousands of tourists visit the delta every year, willing to put up with inconvenience and discomfort and considerable expense, to witness nature work its astonishing wiles. Every darkening evening, for millennia now, a great game has been afoot here. In the Southern Hemisphere's autumn months of March through June, the delta floods with water from Angola's highlands, inundating 1.5 million hectares of flat land and attracting one of the world's greatest concentrations of wildlife. Safari experts on 'trip of a lifetime' Many of the animals, the vegetarians such as impala, elephant, giraffe, zebra and hippopotamus, come for the rich grasses and trees. The carnivores come for them. So tonight we are watching the dogs from a short distance. We whisper to each other in our open-air, Jeep-style vehicle that seems able to drive through anything. Mokwami is at the wheel and his tracker, Gomos Kgaogano, is perched on a mounted seat above a front headlight. This is a rare moment, and even Mokwami, who was born in the Delta, is thrilled to see the dogs. African wild dogs, also called Cape hunting dogs, are officially endangered. Conservationists say shrinking habitat and farmers, hunters and rangers who poison and shoot them to protect livestock are eroding their number. The dogs roam small swaths of forest, desert and savanna in southern Africa. They hunt whatever they can catch: antelope, small wildebeest, warthogs, rodents and even birds. Tonight, they are after impala. Suddenly, they are on the move, first as an unorganized group, then in a line, first walking, now trotting. We haven't seen the impala, but Mokwami knows the dogs have their scent. ""The impala are that way (he points to the right), but the dogs will go that way, then up there (he points to about 11 o'clock), they will turn right. They always follow the line of the bush. Then they will run."" He turns his outstretched arm to 2 o'clock. ""We need to be there to see the chase."" ""How do you know that?"" I ask incredulously. ""These are dogs,"" he says. ""I know these dogs. I have seen dogs before."" The dogs pick up the pace. We start bushwhack-driving toward 2 o'clock, pacing the dogs along the track. We reach a point, and now see the impala through the bush to the right, maybe 600 meters off. The dogs slow, they turn to the right and accelerating, leap into the bushes just behind us. We have a difficult time seeing them, but Mokwami knows where they are heading and we turn right, directly toward the impala along the outside of the bushes that are giving the dogs cover. Suddenly we see a dog through the bushes, then another, then another. They are sprinting. They are making their move. We accelerate, blasting and bouncing through the uneven grass. The impala are on high alert, watching the bush, watching us, perceiving a threat but not yet knowing what it is. Suddenly, the dogs streak out of the bush straight for the impala, and the chase is on. On level, unobstructed ground, Mokwami explains as we dash in pursuit, a dog can catch an impala. An impala's high step can kick up dirt, and if it can gain ground, the flying dirt will confuse the dog's scent. But there they are! From behind a bush, an impala flies in full sprint, and at most two seconds behind, the dogs are ripping after it like a stiff evening wind. The speed and focus of the predator and the prey are razor-sharp. We race along on a parallel track. The dogs are going to get him, I'm sure of it. Mokwami isn't so certain. ""Mayyyybe, mayyybe,"" he says. What I have yet to learn is that the impala isn't just running from something, it's running toward something. This isn't a chase. It's a race. I begin to understand the great game being played. The predators here are the best in the business, but the prey are thinkers, too. It's a balancing game for both. Natural selection has left the prey with innate understandings about how to survive in a predator-driven world. Those that don't know, die. For the predators, those that understand and counter, eat. Those that don't, die. ""It is a great balance,"" Mokwami explains. ""It is great drama every day. The impala, they know things the dogs do not know. It is the same with the zebra. They know the herd protects them, and they watch out for each other. The lions, they know they must sneak up quietly, and get as close as they can and surprise the zebra, or pounce on the zebra when the zebra tries to get through the bush. ""Each one reacts and counter-reacts to the other. It is not easy to win. But once now, one does. Once later, the other one does. It is not so uneven. It is the way they live."" And this time, the impala will win, because it knows, just ahead, there is a small lake, and it knows dogs cannot run fast through water. The dogs are close on the impala's heels, but it reaches the pond maybe one second ahead, charges in, and the dogs stop at the shore. They know following is pointless, and besides, there are hippopotamus in the lake, and that is a danger. The dogs don't look happy. In fact, they look stunned. Later, from far off, we see the dogs again in ravenous pursuit of several other impala. The race is on again. We scream over the bumpy grass, trying to catch up, but the pack loses us. Mokwami explains that this time, the dogs will eat. There is no water around, and it is the dog's last chance before darkness. The impala will not escape. Every evening it is like this, every year, forever. If one makes the journey here, the great game is easy to see. It plays out under the darkening African sky. Over time, the prey get better at escaping, because the ones that don't, die and don't reproduce. The predators get better too, because the ones that don't adapt to the prey's improving skills also die off. It's natural selection: All the species improve by hunting or fleeing from each other. On the way back to camp, tracker Kgaogano catches a hyena in his spotlight. It is heading toward where the dogs last chased the impala. It will see if the dogs left anything for it to eat, Mokwami explains. Maybe the hyena will try to chase the dogs from their catch. Maybe it will win tonight. Maybe not.","A rare sighting of African wild dogs leads to an exciting game drive .

"(CNN) -- My commitment to the cause of stopping the exploitation of children was born from a humbling experience. In 2002, I witnessed the horrors of human trafficking as we rescued three trembling girls living on the impoverished streets of India. Preventing these girls from falling prey to this horrendous crime was a personal awakening. I thank CNN's Heroes initiative for allowing the Ricky Martin Foundation to share and engage others in our commitment to end the exploitation of children by human trafficking and modern-day slavery. That was more than a decade ago. Since then, I knew my foundation must shed a light on this taboo subject. Education has been our pillar from the outset. In 2004, we launched People for Children, our principal project, to provide education and solutions for international efforts to eliminate child trafficking. This unscrupulous market -- which consists of 27 million victims worldwide, according to the 2011 Trafficking in Persons Report -- generates up to $32 billion annually, an amount rivaling that of the trafficking of arms and drugs. Of the 27 million, UNICEF estimates that 1.2 million are children who are trafficked every year to work as forced labor, in the commercial sex industry, in prostitution and in other forms of slavery. The statistics are staggering. Many contest them because the crimes are hidden. But numbers don't matter: Preventing one or 200 children from traffickers validates our mission. No one should be exploited and deprived of his or her freedom. We believe every child has the right to be a child. As a young public charity, we have discovered we are not alone in this fight. We have been privileged to partner with groups such as UNICEF, Habitat for Humanity, The Protection Project at Johns Hopkins University, the University of Puerto Rico, Save the Children, RTL Foundation, The InterAmerican Development Bank, The Trafficking In Persons Office, SAP, Doral Bank and Microsoft. We joined forces with the InterAmerican Development Bank and the International Organization for Migration to launch Call and Live, the first regional campaign to combat human trafficking in the Americas. Lives were saved. We received thousands of phone calls through our hot line and were able to help launch hundreds of investigations in five countries. Unfortunately, atrocities committed against children have reached epidemic proportions on the Internet. To prevent these crimes, we launched Navega Protegido.org, an online bilingual child safety website, that provides tools to protect children from pornography and sexual exploitation. More recently, we published ""Human Trafficking in Puerto Rico: An Invisible Challenge"" in alliance with the University of Puerto Rico and The Protection Project. The pioneering investigation documents that too many minors in Puerto Rico are at risk of becoming exploited as sex slaves, as slave labor or used in pornography. Such findings led us to focus on the development of creative solutions. We are developing our first Child Development and Prevention Center in Puerto Rico to serve as a safe haven for children and young people. We aim to transform their lives through a holistic approach. Children and young people do not have a sufficiently loud voice in our society. To help change this, we continue to strengthen People for Children by redoubling our investigation and awareness campaigns. Our objective is to galvanize a movement to prevent this scourge. Addressing such an abominable crime on a global scale is a daunting challenge. We need to tackle it one life at a time. I am convinced that small triumphs over a long period of time will eventually result in the type of social justice we must all strive for. Human trafficking has no place in our world today. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Ricky Martin.","1.2 million children are trafficked each year for forced labor, sex industry .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama got help from his wife and his vice president Wednesday in continuing a public pressure campaign on Republicans to join Democrats in passing his $447 billion jobs plan. First lady Michelle Obama announced that 270 private companies have pledged to hire 25,000 veterans and their spouses by the end of 2013. The companies are part of a trade group called the American Logistics Association. Their commitment, she said, would fulfill 25% of the president's call for private-sector companies to hire or train 100,000 veterans and military spouses in the next two years. The first lady's announcement preceded a speech by Obama at a joint military base in Virginia on the third and last day of his bus tour through North Carolina and Virginia aimed at pressuring Congress to pass his jobs package. Obama discussed the importance of hiring American veterans during a stop at the Joint Base Langley-Eustis, calling the initiative a top priority. ""There are far too many veterans who are coming home and having to struggle to find a good job,"" Obama said. ""It doesn't make any sense."" The president said, ""We ask our men and women in uniform to leave their families. ""The last thing you should have to do is fight for a job when you come home,"" he said. He also called on Congress to pass his jobs bill, saying the need to focus on jobs was ""an American responsibility."" Later in the day, Obama used a speech to firefighters in North Chesterfield, Virginia, to urge Republicans to stop opposing his jobs plan. Republican counter-proposals to cut regulations and roll back health care and Wall Street reforms failed to address the need to reduce unemployment, Obama argued. ""Dirtier air, dirtier water, fewer people on health care, no accountability on Wall Street -- that is not a jobs plan,"" Obama said. ""I'm happy to have a debate, but in the meantime, let's focus on putting people back to work."" In particular, Obama called for Congress to pass one component of his plan that would provide funding for state and local governments to hire police officers, firefighters and teachers. The measure would be paid for by increasing the tax rate on millionaires by 0.5%. ""My taxes will go up a little bit, but I can afford it,"" Obama said. Vice President Joe Biden also pushed for the measure, telling a Senate Democratic rally in support of the jobs plan that the specific provision meant someone earning $1.1 million a year would pay an extra $500 in taxes. ""And you know the really sad thing about it is? The millionaires know we should do this. They don't oppose this,"" Biden said. ""They know it is the equitable thing to do."" Republicans have blocked debate on the Obama jobs plan in the Senate. They argue that any tax increase would harm economic growth and job creation, while Obama and Democrats contend that the president's package ensures immediate job growth. Asked by CNN why Obama kept pushing a tax hike that Republicans continually reject, Biden said the debate exposed GOP reluctance to work with the White House and Democrats on an agreement. ""There's not a single thing they are for,"" Biden said. ""How can they argue against a half-percent surtax on people whose average income is a million bucks?"" Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky accused Obama of using his bus trip for political campaigning instead of working with Republicans on jobs legislation that can pass with support from both parties. ""Everyone knows the last thing you want to do in a jobs crisis is raise taxes,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor. ""But for some reason, he's determined to keep trying anyway, and Republicans aren't about to go along with it."" Calling Obama ""completely out of touch,"" McConnell said the White House and Congress should ""forget about the tax hikes, let's drop the talking points about millionaires and billionaires, and let's work together on bipartisan jobs legislation that's designed to pass, not designed to fail."" Obama, however, continued to push for a public campaign to pressure Republicans to pass his plan. ""We'll see if they fight just as hard for your job as they do for their own job,"" he told the Virginia firefighters. Democrats are promising to force votes on individual components of the Obama plan, starting with $35 billion for states and localities to hire more teachers and first responders while preventing current ones from being laid off. That part of the plan could come up for a vote before the end of this week. Republicans have accused the president of engaging in ""class warfare,"" while Democrats say wealthier Americans need to share in the cost of fiscal responsibility. Among other things, Obama's overall blueprint includes an extension and expansion of the current payroll tax cut, an extension of jobless benefits, new tax credits for businesses that hire the long-term unemployed and additional money to help save and create jobs for teachers and first responders such as firefighters. CNN's Ted Barrett and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama and his vice president push for jobs legislation .

"(CNN) -- The Pakistani actress featured in a racy cover shot in the December edition of a men's magazine in India told CNN she posed topless but not completely naked. Veena Malik appeared on the cover of the Indian edition of FHM wearing only one thing: a tattoo on her arm bearing the initials ISI, the acronym for Pakistan's infamous Inter-Services Intelligence agency -- causing a stir in her conservative homeland. Malik said FHM doctored the photographs to show her without clothes and has now revealed plans to sue the publication. ""I admit that I have done a bold shoot,"" she said, ""but I was not nude. There is a big difference between topless and being nude. ""You will see various shoots here in the Bollywood industry where the actresses actually went topless but they were covered like the way I was."" In a telephone call with CNN, Malik said she had declined an offer a couple of months ago by an ""international (media) agency"" to pose nude for a fee but agreed to do a shoot for FHM India instead -- and without charges -- because it was a ""personality"" shoot. ""What I have lost is priceless,"" she said. But FHM India says Malik knew the terms all along and approved the photos. The publication is even demanding a public apology and has threatened to counter-sue Malik for defamation. ""She was completely aware of the cover,"" said FHM editor Kabeer Sharma. ""She was completely aware of the concept. She loved the concept."" Malik denies this. Lawyer Ayaz Bilawala told CNN that Malik is seeking $1.9 million in damages, saying the magazine ""cheated"" his client and doctored the nude pictures. In a legal notice served to the magazine, Malik contends that it was Sharma's idea for her to wear the painted on ISI tattoo; she was told it would be good for her image. In another photo, which was originally slated for the cover, she is shown holding a grenade in her right hand. FHM published the grenade photo inside, with a line plastered across it: ""The cover we didn't use."" Malik said the shoot was supposed to create positive feelings, not negative ones. She added that the controversy has affected her family, particularly her father. ""He did not speak to me. He spoke to one of the media groups and like he was (crying), I mean he was too upset ... Okay I mean I don't blame him for that."" But the actress and model is no stranger to controversy. She triggered uproar two years ago when she claimed that her former boyfriend, Pakistani cricketer Mohammed Asif, was involved in spot-fixing international matches. Asif was found guilty last month in an English court. A year later, the actress came under fire from Pakistani clerics who decried her behavior in the Indian reality TV show ""Big Boss,"" as ""un-Islamic."" ""I am not a perfect Muslim or a perfect person, but I haven't committed a crime, and unfortunately things like this are part and parcel of the industry I work in,"" Malik said. Still, she downplayed her criticism back home. ""I am not bothered about what they think,"" she said. ""My fans and many Pakistanis support me and believe (in) me."" Harmeet Shah Singh reported from New Delhi and Shaan Khan reported from Islamabad, Pakistan.","Veena Malik appeared in FHM wearing only one thing: a tattoo on her arm bearing the initials ISI .

"(CNN) -- Most of us have dreamed of telling our bosses what they can do with this stupid job, perhaps with the help of a marching band, if your fantasies skew grandiose. So what happens to the guy who actually does it and lives to post a video of the stunt on YouTube? The numbers don't lie: Twenty-four-year-old Joey DeFrancesco has become a veritable Internet celebrity, a hero and a viral video sensation. The original YouTube video of ""Joey Quits"" earned more than 2 million views a week, which includes 18,092 likes and 438 dislikes and counting. ""I'm goingï»¿ to quit like that if I'm going to quit,"" one commenter said, echoing the wishful thinking of many. ""Joey is the hero of all downtrodden workers because he is the embodiment of 'take this job and shove it.' He's living out the fantasies of countless workers who also hate their bosses,"" said Allison Hemming, CEO of the Hired Guns, a digital marketing and talent agency. Beyond resonating with millions of people, the video says a few things about how social media are changing the way businesses interact not just with customers but with employees, she said. ""Managers should remember that if you're terrible to your people while they are working for you, your formerly silent former employees will have a platform to out you in a potentially very public way. And that sentiment can effect your business too."" It also demonstrates how social media are allowing employees to control the circumstances of their departure for a change, said Anne Kreamer, a former Nickelodeon executive and author of ""It's Always Personal: Emotions in the New Workplace."" She cited ousted Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz's e-mail to Yahoo employees saying ""I've just been fired over the phone"" as another example of someone getting in front of their former bosses to control the message. ""Rather than having the situation defined for them, people are trying to shape the conversation on their own. For all we know, Joey was going to get fired the next day, but he turned it around."" The video's release couldn't be more timely, although DeFrancesco made the video when he quit his job at the Renaissance Providence Downtown Hotel in August. The unemployment rate has remained at 9.1%, since July and new claims for unemployment benefits have lingered above 400,000 since April. Those factors, taken with the Occupy Wall Street movement, create the ideal cultural climate for the birth of an Internet folk hero who embodies the anger and malaise felt by many, Kreamer said. ""There's a kind of confluence of events that's forcing people's anger and dissatisfaction to the surface. Everyone's been taking it on the chin for years because of the recession but now they're exhausted and want change,"" Kreamer said. ""Joey's approach is unique in saying, 'I'm going to have some fun with this.' "" DeFrancesco is not the first, and he's probably not the last, to publicly stage his flame-out. If anything, his video is the latest example of how the Internet age has created a broader platform for behavior that used to be contained to smaller circles, Oregon-based career coach Dorothy Tannahill Moran said. ""People have been flaming out publicly forever. Now, with social media, we have a bigger stage for our flame-outs, and there's ever so many more places for it to be done,"" Moran said. A YouTube video posted in 2007 shows a Moe's Southwest Grill manager tearing off his work shirt to reveal a white T-shirt with the words ""I QUIT"" while ""Ice, Ice Baby"" plays. The worker launches into a respectable imitation of Vanilla Ice's original dance routine, complete with backup dancers. Another take on the ""I QUIT"" chest proclamation appeared in a 2008 YouTube video of a man who tears off his shirt and has the phrase written on his bare skin. He giddily skips around the office, boom box on shoulder, with ""just gotta get right outta here"" from Queen's ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" on a loop. The last disgruntled employee to strike a chord in the public consciousness was former JetBlue flight attendant Steven Slater, who famously deployed an emergency evacuation slide to dramatically exit an airplane after announcing to the flight that he was fed up. Slater was back in the news Thursday when he was sentenced to a year of probation after completing a mental health treatment program. His departure will cost him $10,000 in restitution to JetBlue, the price of repairing or replacing the emergency evacuation chute. Slater told CNN the past year had been ""long"" and ""challenging."" He spent much of it commuting to a New York treatment facility from Los Angeles, where took care of his ill mother, who died this year. But just imagine if someone had captured the incident on camera, Moran said. Each departure reflects how the person felt about his job. ""The question becomes what's the genesis of what prompted them to not just quit but to engage others in their departure,"" she said. ""It's usually a combination of frustrations, usually oriented toward management, but it can also include other stressors from the job."" DeFrancesco said problems with management led to his departure. He said he worked at the hotel for more than three years, during which time he participated in a push for employees to join a union. The employees prevailed, but the struggle damaged relations between management and employees, he said. ""They treat us like s***,"" DeFrancesco said at the start of the YouTube video. ""I'm going to go and quit right now with the help of my bandmates."" On the video, he leads members of the What Cheer? Brigade into the hotel through a side entrance. His boss encounters them and tells them to leave, DeFrancesco responds by handing him a letter and saying ""I quit."" Cue the band as DeFrancesco walks away, smiling broadly, hands raised in triumph. DeFrancesco said he has a new job that allows him to use his history degree, but he wouldn't say where. But it's hard to say what the stunt will cost him in the long run, Hemming said. ""If Joey wants to work in a creative industry, he may get to keep his hero status and use it to his advantage,"" she said. ""I'd say to him, get an agent, use this moment to your advantage."" Finding a job in corporate America, where potential employers do extensive background checks, could be more challenging, she said. ""He can expect to definitely be Googled by hiring and recruiting managers who might take a pass on him because they'll think, 'do I want to be the butt of a Joey joke when he quits on me in a few years? This guy seems like a disgruntled employee before I've even met him. I think I'll pass.' "" Or, maybe it won't matter in a few years, as we grow even more accustomed to living our lives online. ""My guess is he's not going to want to work in the hotel industry, but he's super-young, so don't think it'll irreparably ruin his chances. Depending on the job, it might endear him to a potential employer.""","YouTube video of man resigning with a marching band earns more than 2 million hits in a week .

"(CNN) -- The week-old redesign of quick-messaging service Twitter was meant to simplify its tools and make it more accessible to newbies. But it has had some unintended consequences. Independent developers of applications that tie into Twitter's network say they have experienced significant accelerations in downloads and revenue since Twitter 4.0 launched last week. When addicts of the social network got their hands on the new version, many recoiled upon seeing the changes. They were especially vocal about the loss of some features in Twitter's mobile apps and about the private-message tab being hidden within another menu. So thousands flocked to the various app stores to get third-party apps that look more like the previous version of Twitter. Some of the most popular apps cost a few dollars, unlike the free app made by Twitter. Tweetbot, an anime-themed app for the iPhone, more than doubled its usual revenue just after Twitter's major redesign, said Paul Haddad, a co-founder for app maker Tapbot. When the small developer cut the price of Tweetbot in half on Friday, to 99 cents, revenue increased more than tenfold, Haddad said. Independent trackers of app downloads verify that Tweetbot and others experienced big gains. ""Word of mouth really goes a long way on Twitter,"" Haddad wrote in an e-mail. The maker of another popular app, Twitterrific, saw a ""bump"" after the Twitter changes, which carried through to this week, said Craig Hockenberry, the head of app maker Iconfactory. This effect is common, but short-lived, after a major change to Twitter, he said. Twitterrific, which offers a free version with ads or a full version for $4.99, experienced a similar boost in March after Twitter updated its iPhone app with a much-maligned feature called the Quick Bar, Hockenberry said. The Quick Bar, which critics dubbed Dick Bar after Twitter CEO Dick Costolo, added an ever-present ticker showing trending topics and ads. Within a month, Twitter had removed the feature. ""Please stop complaining about the new Twitter app,"" Haddad wrote on his Tapbot Twitter account last week. ""They might revert back, and I'm really enjoying the increase in sales."" For a relatively new Twitter app, like Twittelator Neue, the backlash provided some much-needed attention. That app, which costs $1.99, has seen about three times as many downloads in the week since Twitter 4.0. ""We've definitely seen a spike since Twitter updated their official client,"" Ollie Wagner, the Twittelator developer, wrote in an e-mail. ""Changes like the ones they've made tend to be quite polarizing, oftentimes magnetizing audiences towards newer third party clients."" In March, during the Quick Bar fiasco, Twitter began discouraging makers of these types of apps from pursuing development. Ryan Sarver, a leader on Twitter's developer relations team, wrote then in a memo to partners that they should not be building software that reproduces the functions of a standard Twitter app. ""We need to move to a less fragmented world, where every user can experience Twitter in a consistent way,"" Sarver wrote. ""This is already happening organically -- the number and market share of consumer client apps that are not owned or operated by Twitter has been shrinking."" As that number seems to grow slightly, it's unclear whether Twitter's stance has changed. A Twitter spokeswoman declined to comment, and Sarver didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.","Twitter's redesign last week spurred more downloads for third-party apps .
Many Twitter users were unhappy with the overhaul to Twitter .
Some were willing to pay a premium for apps that look familiar ."
"Washington (CNN) -- It used to be said that if the American economy sneezed, Latin America and the Caribbean would catch a cold. Not so anymore. Despite the great recession of 2008, the region has kept growing and avoided, largely unscathed, the troubles that still ail the United States. The 20 nations that informally make up Latin America boast a booming economy with a combined GDP of more than $6 trillion, according to 2010 estimates by the International Monetary Fund. Latin America and the Caribbean, with a population of over 591 million people in 2011, are a potent market in a region where the U.S. already has free trade agreements with Mexico, Chile, Peru, Colombia and Panama. But with 2,000 miles of a common border between the U.S. and Mexico (its third-largest trading partner after Canada and China), a complicated communist presence still in Cuba, simmering anti-American sentiments in Venezuela, and Brazil -- the largest economy in Latin America and the U.S.'s eighth-largest trading partner -- already a formidable economic powerhouse, the region is anything but a stable, sedate space in the Western Hemisphere. As the U.S. is actively engaged in a deadly drug war in Mexico, Colombia and most of Central America and the Caribbean, and an arms deal gone bad is threatening to consume a sitting U.S. attorney general, the region could easily be seen as a very real security threat for the next occupant of the White House. So will Latin America be one of the issues that the eight major Republican candidates confront during Tuesday's CNN National Security Debate in Washington? You might not think so. A Google search of news stories on ""national security"" and ""foreign policy"" resulted in articles related to Syria, the Middle East, terrorism and who is advising the Republican candidates. Latin America or the Caribbean don't show up on the first 10 screens. Still, candidates ignore the region at their peril. New president in Guatemala . Hugo Chávez, the ailing president of Venezuela, has in the past reached out to Russia, Iran and Syria for arms support and strategic alliances. In Cuba, Raúl Castro, who took over as president of the country from his older brother Fidel in 2008, is only now starting to loosen restrictions on property ownership and instituting other reforms on the socialist island just 90 miles south of Florida. A fence along the border . And then there's immigration. In recent debates, it has been considered more of a domestic issue, with proposals from the major candidates for a single fence, a double fence, an electrified fence and other fence variants along the border with Mexico. Herman Cain, who had been surging in polls but is starting to slip, said that he supported a fence along the Mexican border. ""When I'm in charge of the fence, we going to have a fence. It's going to be 20 feet high. It's going to have barbed wire on the top. It's going to be electrocuted, electrified,"" Cain told a rally in Tennessee. ""And there's going to be a sign on the other side that says it will kill you."" He apologized for the comment, saying ""it was just a joke,"" but a day later said he still supported some sort of electrified fence that could kill people trying to cross the border illegally. Rep. Michelle Bachmann, who was popular early in the GOP race but has since fallen back to single digits in some polls, said she supports a two-part fence. ""I was the very first candidate that signed a pledge that said that, by a date certain, I will build a double-walled fence with -- with an area of security neutrality in between."" Most GOP candidates have opposed most proposals for immigration reform until the border is ""sealed,"" although the Obama administration states that border security is tighter that it has ever been. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement reported last month that the Obama administration deported nearly 400,000 illegal immigrants in the last year, a record number for the third straight year. Staying out of their business . If Latin America and the Caribbean do come up in the discussions Tuesday, Rep. Ron Paul probably will be applauded by the region for his proposal not to meddle in other countries' affairs. He may not get the same applause in Latin America, however, for an idea -- shared by his some of his rivals -- to eliminate much of U.S. foreign aid to the region, which worldwide accounts for less than 1% of the federal budget. Gov. Mitt Romney presented a formal proposal for Latin America focusing on trade and singling out Venezuela and Cuba. Cain says he will follow guidance from Cubans in South Florida on what to do about Cuba and the embargo. Romney: I won't let Iran get nukes . Meanwhile, Gov. Rick Perry would send U.S. troops to help fight the war on drugs in Mexico, although that country most likely wouldn't accept them. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who appears to be the most informed of the candidates on the region by far, says he's learning Spanish and follows issues beyond the standard talking points on Cuba, Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil. The current crop of Republican candidates would be wise to pay attention to the looming security presence posed by Latin America, whether it is drugs in Mexico, cartels in Colombia, Castros in Cuba, or a Chávez in Venezuela.","Latin America has a booming economy with more than $6 trillion in GDP .

"London, England (CNN) -- Police say they arrested a total of 153 people when students protested against planned hikes in university tuition. Police said that after the protest was scheduled to end Tuesday at 2 p.m., a large group of protesters still congregated at Trafalgar Square. ""As a result a group of around 150-200 people who still refused to leave were contained by police in Trafalgar Square. Despite repeated requests to disperse, this group remained,"" London's Metropolitan Police said in a statement late Tuesday. Authorities said 139 of the 153 were arrested for breach of the peace. Others were charged with violent disorder, common assault, obstructing police and criminal damage. iReport: Student protestors demonstrate in London . The protesters say they are angry at government plans to remove the current annual cap of 3,000 pounds (about $4,700) on university tuition and allow schools to charge as much as 9,000 pounds (about $14,200). The change is part of the government's plan to cut its massive budget deficit. Defenders of the plan say universities will not necessarily charge the maximum they're allowed to, and the government has said students will not need to pay back the fees until they earn at least 21,000 pounds (about $32,600) a year. That threshold is currently 15,000 pounds (about $23,300) a year. CNN's Carol Jordan contributed to this report.","Some arrested after being asked to leave Trafalgar Square .

"(CNN) -- There once was a time -- like, oh, the late 1990s -- when the box set loomed over the music world like a just reward. With dazzling presentations -- 3-D brains! Lucite cubes! portable faux-phonographs! -- and equally unrestrained liner notes, these CD collections were the ultimate capstone to an artist's career or the last word in genre compilations. And then, they faded away. Not entirely, of course. But in an iTunes-dominated MP3 world faced with declining CD sales -- and fewer artists and genres left to mine -- the box set (or boxed set, if you prefer) now takes a back seat to iPods and singles. Who has time to get immersed in a 6-CD collection of greatest hits, choice cuts and outtakes? It's almost as quaint as reading a book, for Pete's sake. But the box set isn't dead yet, and each year brings a number that are as lovingly prepared and painstakingly presented as the classics of yore. Here are seven that are worth your while this season. ""The Smile Sessions,"" The Beach Boys (Capitol, 5 CDs, 2 LPs, 2 45s) It was 1966 and Brian Wilson was going to outdo ""Pet Sounds,"" the Beach Boys classic released in May of that year. He had a vision of an album that would summarize the American journey. With lyrics provided by Van Dyke Parks, Wilson worked over his songs endlessly, trying to harness the sounds running through his head. He almost went mad. In the end, it was too much; around May 1967, he pulled the plug. The end of ""Smile"" was the end of a chapter for Wilson and the Beach Boys: They would never attempt to scale such musical heights again. But the album refused to go away. Bootleggers put out versions, and Capitol released about 30 minutes on the Beach Boys' 1993 box set. Wilson himself revisited it for a 2004 solo album. Now comes the original recordings, showcasing song progressions, studio chatter and those gorgeous Beach Boys harmonies on such songs as ""Heroes and Villains,"" ""Cabinessence"" and ""Surf's Up."" The deluxe box includes vinyl, archival photographs and other ""Smile""-related material. The greatest unreleased album of all time? You be the judge. ""Phil Spector Presents the Philles Album Collection,"" Various Artists (Sony/Legacy, 7 CDs) What sound was Brian Wilson pursuing? It was Phil Spector's Wall of Sound, that echo-y, mighty mass of music that spilled through AM radios like the voice of heaven itself. Undergirding it all was the Wrecking Crew, the band of L.A. session kings (including drummer Hal Blaine, guitarist Glen Campbell and saxophonist Steve Douglas) who never let up on the beat. This set presents the original albums from the Crystals, the Ronettes and Bob B. Soxx and the Blue Jeans, with an extra disc of label sides for good measure. ""Nevermind"" Super Deluxe edition, Nirvana (Geffen, 4 CDs, 1 DVD) Sometimes the changing of the guard is as obvious as the progressions of No. 1 singles on the Billboard charts. In early 1964, Bobby Vinton's ""There! I Said It Again"" gave way to the Beatles' ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on the singles chart and, just like that, the British Invasion dawned. Similarly, on January 11, 1992, Michael Jackson's ""Dangerous"" was knocked out of the top spot on the album chart by three scruffy lads from Washington state, and the indie-grunge gold rush was on. The Super Deluxe edition of Nirvana's 1991 classic includes the original album as well as studio outtakes, live cuts and -- most interesting of all -- Butch Vig's original mix. ""Smiths Complete,"" The Smiths (Rhino, 8 CDs) Stop me if you think you've heard this one before: An amusingly morose lyricist/singer joins forces with a jangly, riff-minded guitarist and a crack rhythm section. The four produce several singles with titles such as ""Girlfriend in a Coma,"" ""William, It Was Really Nothing,"" and ""Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now,"" top the British charts for a few years, and then go their separate ways. That was the story of the Smiths, and their four studio albums -- along with three compilations and a live album -- have been remastered by the guitarist, Johnny Marr, for this box set. For the true diehards, Rhino Records also has a limited-edition version with CDs, LPs, singles, posters and wallpaper, yours for $499.98. ""The Armstrong Box,"" Louis Armstrong (Storyville, 7 CDs, 1 DVD) The man who helped create jazz with his Hot Five and Hot Seven groups has been the subject of several box sets, but considering his career spanned five decades, there's always more to uncover. Storyville Records has compiled live performances from 1947 to 1967, including "" 'S Wonderful,"" ""Basin Street Blues"" and several versions of ""When It's Sleepy Time Down South."" (For those who want an Armstrong primer, Elvis Costello recommends the import ""Ambassador of Jazz,"" a 10-disc collection packaged in a miniature suitcase.) ""Smokestack Lightning: The Complete Chess Masters 1951-1960,"" Howlin' Wolf (Hip-O, 4 CDs) If you want to know where rock 'n' roll starts, you could easily find yourself at 2120 S. Michigan Avenue in Chicago, the longtime home of Chess Records. (It's now the site of Willie Dixon's Blues Heaven Foundation.) Among Chess' stars was bluesman Chester Burnett, better known as Howlin' Wolf, who set the place afire with the songs ""Back Door Man,"" ""Spoonful"" and, of course, ""Smokestack Lightning,"" many written and/or produced by Dixon -- and cornerstones for any self-respecting blues or rock band. He was 41 when he first started recording for Chess, and he helped make the label the legend it is. ""This May Be My Last Time Singing: Raw African-American Gospel on 45 RPM 1957-1982,"" Various Artists (Tompkins Square, 3 CDs) So much of the most interesting American music was done for small labels on the fly; after all, it's not as though every artist could afford endless hours of studio time, paid for with big major-label advances. Some of this material has come in for a ribbing in the CD/Internet age -- think about those sites devoted to ugly album covers, never mind the music within -- but several labels have devoted themselves to searching out and mastering these long-lost recordings. ""This May Be My Last Time Singing"" is a follow-up to ""Fire in My Bones,"" a 2009 collection also put together by Mike McGonigal, featuring music straight from the soul.","Several notable box sets available this year .
One of the biggest: ""The Smile Sessions,"" Beach Boys classic finally released .

"(CNN) -- Seven people were killed when a car careered into a crowd of people watching the Dutch royal family riding past in an open-top bus Thursday. Queen Beatrix began her reign in 1980 after her mother abdicated the throne. The incident occurred during Queen's Day, a national holiday celebrated every April 30 to mark the queen's birthday. The birthday of Queen Beatrix -- the current monarch -- is actually January 31. The celebrations are a reflection of how widely popular members of the royal family remain in the country as national figureheads. They have no political power, but hold a large number of ceremonial duties. The Netherlands only became a kingdom with its own monarch in the early 19th century. However, Queen Beatrix descends from the Nassau and Orange dynasties which ruled the area as stewards for six centuries. The House of Nassau's role dates back to 1403, when Count Engelbrecht I of Nassau married Johanna van Polanen, the lady of Breda. As they acquired more land, they entered the ranks of the highest nobility and a series of deaths and inheritances saw the German-born Prince William I  found the House of Orange Nassau in the mid 16th century. In 1688 England invited the then Dutch stadtholder (steward), the above William's grandson, William of Orange, whose wife Mary was a Stuart, to rule England. In 1795 the last Dutch stadtholder, Prince Willem V, was forced to flee to England when the French invaded. The area remained part of the French Republic, and later Napoleonic Empire, until 1815, when Prince Willem V's son established the Netherlands, becoming King Willem I. His grandson, William III, was the kingdom's last male ruler. When he died in 1890, his wife, Emma, became regent for nine years, until their daughter Wilhelmina was old enough to accede to the throne. Wilhelmina's 50-year rule took in both world wars. However, as has become the norm with Dutch monarchs, she abdicated in 1948 to allow her daughter, Juliana, to take the throne. Queen Juliana would famously dress in casual clothes and ride her bike to visit friends. She reigned until 1980, when she abdicated to allow Beatrix to begin her reign. Queen Beatrix, now 71, married the German diplomat Claus von Amsberg, a source of protests at the time as he had served in the German Wehrmacht during World War II, in 1966 and they had three sons: Willem-Alexander (born 1967), Friso (born 1968) and Constantijn (born 1969). Prince Claus became a very popular figure before passing away on October 6 in 2002. Queen Beatrix has indicated that she won't be abdicating in the near future, as she wants Crown Prince Willem-Alexander and his wife, Princess Maxima, to spend time with their family.","Netherlands only became kingdom with its own monarch in early 19th century .

"(CNN) -- The government of China announced Friday that it plans to increase its defense budget by 12.7%, according to Xinhua news agency. Li Zhaoxing, a former foreign minister for the Chinese government, made the announcement at the Fourth Session of the 11th National People's Congress, the news service reported. Li is the spokesman for the session, according to Xinhua. The planned increase in China's defense budget would mark the second hike in military spending in as many years, according to the government. In 2010, China increased its defense budget by 7.5% from the previous year, Li said. In 2011, China plans to increase defense spending by 67.6 billion yuan to a total of 601 billion yuan, according to Li. The sum is the equivalent of $91 billion U.S., he said. The planned budget increase does not reflect a change in the nation's military aspirations, Li said. ""The limited military strength of China is solely for safeguarding its national sovereignty and territorial integrity and would not pose a threat to any country,"" Li said, according to Xinhua. ""The government has always tried to limit military spending and it has set the defense spending at a reasonable level."" The government plans to use more of its defense budget to improve its armament, training and human resource development as well as raise living standards for China's armed forces, he said. The government is not under-reporting the amount of money it plans to spend on defense, he said . ""There is no such thing as a so-called hidden military expenditure in China. And the budget is subject to auditing from the government and military."" China's ratio of defense spending to gross domestic product is less than many countries, Li said. That includes the United States, which Li said, is spending $725 billion in 2011, the news service reported.","China announces 12.7% hike in defense budget, according to Xinhua news agency .

"(CNN) -- What does $40 per paycheck mean for you and your family? That's what the White House is asking Americans as part of a public campaign to put pressure on the Republican-controlled House of Representatives to pass a payroll tax cut extension. The payroll tax cut is worth roughly $1,000 a year -- or $40 a paycheck -- for an average family. It affects about 160 million Americans. Responses, which ranged from the serious to the inane, began pouring in Tuesday after the White House posted the question on its Twitter and Facebook accounts: . ""It would be easier to make my student loan payments,"" tweeted Matthew Nocella. David Paul Hluchy posted on Facebook that $40 means ""40 Hot Wheels mainline cars."" iReport: What could you do with $40? The price of a tank of gas, grocery bills and prescription costs, though, appeared to be the most popular topics on the White House social media sites. ""#40dollars is a tank of gas to get me to and from work for the week. That means two less tanks of gas a month,"" tweeted Jim Schmidt. Barb B tweeted: ""It means getting a new winter jacket for my toddler son (he lost his last week) & the rest for groceries."" tweeted Barb B . Gloria Attar took it one step further, breaking it down in a tweet how she can spend the money: ""#40dollars is school lunches for 1 mo or water bill for 2 mos; or meat budget for 1mo w/coupons, loyalty card & store specials."" Leslie T tweeted that $40 was two months worth of bowling outings with her autistic son. The payroll tax cut debate on the White House Facebook page, though, resembled the congressional logjam with people throwing barbs at Republicans and Democrats as well as at one another. ""If I have $1,000 less, I'll spend $1,000 less. Is Congress prepared to do the same to extend the tax cuts?"" Tara Eudy asked in her post. Republican and Democrats in the House and Senate have taken to the airwaves over the issue, with Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona saying the tax cut must be extended to help out Americans still struggling in the economic recovery. It was a response echoed, albeit a bit differently, by Karen Tanner who posted a two word answer on the White House Facebook page: . ""What paycheck?""","White House asks public what $40 a paycheck means .

"London (CNN) -- A newly discovered painting by Renaissance master Leonardo da Vinci has sent shock waves through the art world, prompting speculation that more of his paintings could be as yet undiscovered. The ""Salvator Mundi"" was, for years, thought to be a painting by one of da Vinci's pupils or associates. But after a lengthy period of study and conservation, it has been authenticated as a da Vinci. The painting was sold in 1958 for Â£45 -- about $125 in today's currency -- by descendants of British collector Sir Frederick Cook, who bought the painting in 1900. Today, the painting is estimated to be worth $200 million, according to some scholars. Though the conservator who helped to reveal the painting's true identity called it ""the rarest thing imaginable,"" speculation is rife that there are other Leonardo da Vinci paintings still at large, possibly lying unknown in private collections. There are currently some 15 authenticated Leonardo da Vinci paintings in the world. But they are difficult to attribute, because da Vinci often left his works unfinished and some are thought to have been worked on by other artists in his workshops. Martin Kemp, Emeritus Research Professor in the History of Art at Oxford University and a leading expert on Leonardo da Vinci, gives the careful estimate that there are probably no more than 20 paintings by the master in the world, which suggests there could be five more to be discovered. Dianne Dwyer Modestini, who conserved and restored ""Salvator Mundi"" said: ""It's very mysterious, the things that happen to pictures. ""Somehow (""Salvator Mundi"") leaked out of the Royal Collection, was put on the market in the late 18th century and disappeared until 1900,"" she said. The painting sustained several over-paint jobs over the years that obscured its true identity. ""People forget or they begin to doubt the opinion of the person who originally said it was by Leonardo, particularly if it's been badly repaired ... It happens to pictures all the time,"" she said. The last painting by Leonardo da Vinci to be discovered was the ""Benois Madonna"" in 1909. Other major finds in the last 100 years include the discovery of two bound manuscripts by da Vinci in a public library in Madrid in the 1960s. And more recently, a chalk drawing called ""The Beautiful Princess,"" was discovered. It first appeared at Christie's auction house in New York in 1998 and was initially thought to be a 19th-century German imitation of a Renaissance painting. Art historian and Professor Emerita of the Florence University Mina Gregori was one of a number of scholars who authenticated the drawing as a da Vinci, though its provenance remains contested. ""I think that there are works that we do not know,"" said Gregori and that ""there are always surprises up to a certain point."" And given that two Leonardo da Vinci works have been discovered in the space of five years, she is confident there may be more. Works that could be out there include a wooden shield with the face of Medusa painted on it, mentioned in 16th-century art historian Giorgio Vasari's biography of da Vinci; the clay molds of a statue of a horse da Vinci was working on when he was living in Milan; and a mural called ""The Battle of Anghiari,"" which a forensic expert named Maurizio Seracini believes is hidden behind a Vasari fresco in Florence's Palazzo Vecchio. When it comes to paintings and drawings, Gregori believes that a strong market is an important factor in locating them. ""They were special years in the antiquaries (world), when many people were selling art from their homes,"" Gregori said, referring to the period when the ""Beautiful Princess"" and ""Salvator Mundi"" were sold. ""Now, fewer people buy and so fewer people sell, so in these times you find less,"" she continued. But that won't stop people believing there are lost works out there. ""I hope always that we will find new things,"" said Gregori.","Recent disocvery of lost Leonardo da Vinci painting prompts speculation .

"Washington (CNN) -- Former presidential assailant John Hinckley Jr. should not be allowed to spend any unsupervised time during visits to his mother's home in Virginia, according to a psychiatrist who first met Hinckley in the 1980s and interviewed him several times in recent months. Dr. Raymond Patterson testified in a federal court hearing on Wednesday he was concerned to learn that Hinckley sometimes did not follow the hospital-approved itinerary for how he would spend his few hours of unattended time while in Williamsburg, Virginia. In several instances, Hinckley was supposed to go to movies, skipped them and then later told doctors back at his mental hospital in Washington that he had attended the movies. ""He has gone out of his way to lie about it and then embellished the lie,"" said Patterson. The psychiatrist said he questioned Hinckley in November about being dishonest about his activities, and that Hinckley minimized it and called it ""nitpicking."" Hinckley, now 56, was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the March 1981 shooting of President Ronald Reagan, his press secretary James Brady, Secret Service Agent Timothy McCarthy and Washington police Officer Thomas Delahanty. All four men survived, though Brady was permanently disabled and Delahanty's wounds forced him to retire shortly afterward. Patterson said he had asked Hinckley about Secret Service reports Hinckley had gone into book stores and looked at shelves of history books which included volumes about presidential assassination. He said Hinckley maintained he never looked at those books. Patterson said he didn't know whether to believe him. Hinckley currently spends 10 days a month at his elderly mother's home at a gated community. During those visits, he is allowed three hours of unsupervised time twice during his stay, although sometimes Secret Service agents are watching Hinckley without his knowledge. A federal judge is hearing testimony on St. Elizabeths' plan to increase his time in Virginia to two visits of 17 days followed by six stays of 24 days. The hospital is seeking authority to decide after that whether Hinckley should then be released as a permanent outpatient. Dr. Patterson, the former director of forensic psychiatry at St. Elizabeths, told the court he opposes allowing any expansion of Hinckley's trip beyond 17 days and said the unaccompanied time should end. Patterson said Hinckley engages in deception and has what he termed ""distorted relationships"" with women. He said those are risk factors in analyzing whether he could become a danger to himself or others. Patterson said Hinckley lied to his parents and psychiatrists prior to the 1981 Reagan shooting. The doctor made a rare reference to actress Jodie Foster during these proceedings. It was Hinckley's fixation on the actress that led him to shoot Reagan in an attempt to impress her. Patterson said that relationship was a delusion and noted that years after the assassination attempt -- in 1995 -- Hinckley said he was over his feelings for Foster. However, pictures of her were found in his room at St. Elizabeths at that time. Barry Levine, a lawyer for Hinckley, has said the main issue is whether Hinckley is dangerous and that no evidence has been presented to show that he is. Whenever the subject has come up about Hinckley looking at books on assassination, Levine has said there were many books in the history section and agents don't know if Hinckley was looking at any books in particular. The hearing on whether Hinckley should get increased freedoms will resume on Monday.","Dr. Raymond Patterson testifies in federal court about John Hinckley Jr.'s behavior .

"(CNN) -- As fast as Charlie Sheen fell from Hollywood's good graces at the start of 2011, he made his comeback even faster. Thanks in large part to his public apology at the 63rd Emmy Awards, Sheen will welcome the new year with a clean slate -- and a new TV show slated to premiere next summer. But it wasn't tiger blood that allowed the self-proclaimed warlock to turn his life around so quickly. It was the magic of celebrity. The entertainment industry is always quick to forgive celebrities, said Eileen Koch, owner of Eileen Koch and Co. public relations firm in Los Angeles. Once celebrities own up to their wrongdoings and apologize, Koch said, it's easy for them to get back on track -- often with help from a skilled team of handlers and image consultants. Fellow comeback kid David Arquette can attest. After separating from Courteney Cox in October 2010, and sharing TMI on Howard Stern's Sirius radio show, Arquette checked himself into a live-in rehab facility at the beginning of the year. In April, the same month ""Scream 4"" hit theaters, the actor appeared on ""The Tonight Show"" to celebrate 100 days of sobriety. And with a spot on the 13th season of ""Dancing With the Stars,"" Arquette was back in business. One reason it's so easy for celebrities to bounce back from scandal or personal issues is because when they hit rock bottom, they're doing it with money and connections to boot, Hollywood image consultant Michael Sands said. And as nice as disposable income can be during a crisis, their connections shouldn't be discounted. Arquette wouldn't have rebounded so quickly if he hadn't been in the public eye each week on ""Dancing With the Stars,"" Koch said. With Cox and their daughter, Coco, in the audience supporting him, viewers saw a wonderful family image. ""Even I fell in love with him through that show,"" she added. But without a willing client, Koch said, such connections are irrelevant. Stan Rosenfield, Sheen's ex-publicist, might agree. Rosenfield resigned in February after representing Sheen for about seven years -- through the actor's dismissal from ""Two and a Half Men."" Sheen obviously wasn't cooperative for a while, Koch said, referring to the actor's media outbursts, including a ""no-holds-barred"" live interview with TMZ in which Sheen ripped into his ""Two and a Half Men"" bosses and talked about one day sharing his ""epic"" drug stories with his children. But once celebrities apologize and man up to what they've done, Koch said, the industry is usually quick to forgive. And when that happens, the fans will follow suit. Chris Brown has certainly benefited from this cycle as well. The singer, who pleaded guilty to assaulting then-girlfriend Rihanna in 2009, surprised viewers with a high-energy performance at the MTV Music Video Awards in August. Koch said it's much easier for a self-destructive celebrity to rebound than it is for someone such as Brown, but ""the music industry has forgiven him now. So (his fans) are starting to."" Of course, this year hasn't been all steps in the right direction for Brown. He raised his voice and stormed off the ""Good Morning America"" set in March after being asked about the Rihanna assault. By being respectful, apologizing and focusing on his work, Brown has slowly started to rise above his problems, publicists agree. Brown did what celebrities should do when plagued by scandal -- focus on the work, said Samantha von Sperling, director at Polished Social Image Consultants. Brown's album ""Graffiti,"" released in 2009, received mostly negative reviews from critics. ""F.A.M.E.,"" however, was met with praise -- debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart in March. Britney Spears was also due for a turnabout this year -- having been on the mend since her public meltdown in 2007. The pop princess released ""Femme Fatale,"" her sixth chart-topping album, in March. She received the MTV Video Vanguard Award at the VMAs in August. And she confirmed her engagement to her former manager, Jason Trawick, on December 16. The media was quick to acknowledge Spears' comeback. In a post about her March appearance on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live,"" the Los Angeles Times said, ""Whoever's managing Britney Spears these days is doing a pretty great job."" Koch said, ""I love Britney. She didn't do anything wrong. She got sick. People were very mean to her and they shouldn't have been. ... I don't worry about her anymore. She got it together, and she has a strong team behind her."" At that level of celebrity, Koch added, a star's team is everything. ""They can block a lot of stress for you. Tell you why you shouldn't pay attention to this or that. ... The average person doesn't have that kind of support."" Now at 30, Spears finally seems to have her life back on track, which von Sperling said makes her a good example for one of 2011's most notorious celebrities: Lindsay Lohan. But things may be looking up for the tabloid-prone Lohan. Already on probation for two 2007 drunken-driving convictions, Lohan is required to complete community service after being sentenced in May in the theft of a necklace. On December 14, a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge praised the 25-year-old for complying with her probation requirements. Moreover, Lohan's Playboy pictorial ""is breaking sales records,"" Hugh Hefner tweeted on December 18. ""(Lohan is) not a diplomat,"" von Sperling said. ""She's a blond bombshell movie star, so a Playboy cover makes sense. ... But she needs to do another film. And for her sake, it better be a good one ... not some bubblegum crap."" Like Spears, von Sperling said Lohan has time on her side. The industry is less likely to forgive older celebrities, Koch agreed, adding that celebrities should be able to pull it together by their late 20s. And then there's Sheen, she joked. ""Instead of doing a one-man rant directed by nobody,"" von Sperling said, ""(Sheen) should assemble a team of brilliant comedy writers ... pay them their weight in gold and produce a film."" But his FX comedy, ""Anger Management,"" to air in the summer, may be close enough for now. And while some people call Sheen's ""Violent Torpedo of Truth"" tour and public outbursts a fiasco, others are dubbing it a genius marketing ploy. ""(Sheen has) had his problems,"" image consultant Sands said. ""But I think he got it right this whole year. He created a great persona and a great character, and I think this was a great act on his part."" Regardless of how people choose to read into Sheen's tumultuous year, it would appear he's on his way back to the top. ""We're all rooting for Charlie,"" von Sperling said. ""Every time we turn on 'Two and a Half Men' I think we miss him. Because, as charming as Ashton Kutcher is, he's not Charlie Sheen.""","After an apology at the Emmys, Charlie Sheen welcomes 2012 with a clean slate .

"Santa Ana, California (CNN) -- A Fullerton police officer pleaded not guilty Wednesday to charges of involuntary manslaughter and felony use of excessive force in the beating death of a mentally ill homeless man who died after a police arrest. Cpl. Jay Patrick Cicinelli was released Wednesday on $25,000 bail, according to his attorney and a spokeswoman for the prosecutor. Meanwhile, the arraignment of the officer facing more serious charges, Manuel Anthony Ramos, was continued to September 26 at the request of his attorneys. Ramos was being held Wednesday after Orange County Superior Court Judge Erick L. Larsh set his bail at $1 million. Ramos, who is 37 and a 10-year veteran of the Fullerton police, is charged with second degree murder and involuntary manslaughter in the July beating death of Kelly Thomas, who was unarmed. Thomas' father, Ron, urged the judge not to reduce Ramos' bail from $1 million because of ""the horrible manner in which my son was murdered."" The September 26 court hearing, however, will also review Ramos' bail. The judge ordered both officers to surrender their guns within 24 hours. He also set a pretrial hearing for Cicinelli on November 4. The charges were announced Wednesday by the Orange County prosecutor. The actions of Ramos ""were reckless and created a high risk of death and great bodily injury,"" District Attorney Tony Rackauckas told reporters. Ramos faces a maximum sentence of 15 years to life if convicted, authorities said. Cicinelli, who is 39 years old and a 12-year Fullerton police veteran, faces a maximum of four years in prison if convicted. Kelly Thomas, a 37-year-old homeless man with schizophrenia, was beaten by police during an altercation and died five days later. The FBI is also investigating civil rights violations in the case. Six Fullerton officers, including Ramos and Cicinelli, were put on paid leave after Thomas' death. The case drew widespread attention to the police department of Fullerton, located about 25 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles. Since then, two other brutality allegations have been made by men who were allegedly injured by Fullerton police last year, and Officer Kenton Hampton has been placed on paid leave in connection with one of those two complaints, a department spokesman said. Hampton, 41, is a five-year veteran of the Fullerton police, prosecutors said. The other four officers involved in the Thomas incident -- Hampton, Officer Joseph Wolfe, Sgt. Kevin Craig and Cpl. James Blatney -- were not charged because ""the evidence does not show knowing participation in an unlawful act on the part of these officers,"" the prosecutor said in a statement. Thomas suffered brain injuries, facial fractures, rib fractures, and extensive bruising and abrasions, the prosecutor's office said. The Orange County coroner listed the manner of death as a homicide and the cause of death to be ""anoxic encephalopathy with acute bronchopneumonia,"" asphyxia caused by ""mechanical chest compression with blunt cranial-facial injuries during physical altercation with law enforcement,"" prosecutors said. The toxicology report showed no illegal drugs or alcohol in Thomas' system, prosecutors said. ""The cause of death in this case is mechanical compression of the thorax, making it impossible for Kelly Thomas to breathe normal. In other words, with the chest being compressed, Kelly Thomas was unable to inhale,"" Rackauckas told reporters. ""Over time his brain was deprived of oxygen."" Ramos, who is accused of setting into motion the events that led to Thomas' death, made initial contact with Thomas on July 5 after police received a call about a homeless man looking in car windows and pulling on handles of parked cars, Rackauckas said. Cicinelli, who arrived at the scene later, is accused of using excessive force when he allegedly assaulted and beat Thomas, ""acting recklessly, under the color of authority without lawful necessity,"" the prosecutor's office said. Cicinelli is accused of using the front end of his Taser to hit Thomas on the head and face eight times while Thomas was pinned to the ground by other officers and was making no audible sounds, indicating that Thomas was ""down and seriously injured,"" the prosecutor's office said. Ramos made ""a deliberate showing of putting on Latex gloves"" in his detention of Thomas, Rackauckas said. Ramos is accused of making two fists with his gloves still on in front of Thomas, the prosecutor said. ""He lifted his fists to Kelly Thomas and he said, 'You see my fist? Now they're getting to ready to F you up,'"" Rackauckas told reporters, using ""F"" instead of the full profanity. Rackauckas said Ramos' conduct was unacceptable and ""not protecting and serving"" the public. ""Ramos had to know that he was creating a situation where Kelly Thomas feared for his life and was struggling to get away from an armed officer who was going to 'F' him up,"" Rackauckas said. The district attorney said he viewed a bus depot surveillance video of the beating. The video shows 16 minutes passed from the initial contact by police to the start of the beating and alleged unlawful police conduct, the prosecutor said. ""It's heartrending. It's hard to watch and listen to. It's a person saying he's sorry, calling for his dad and asking for help. He seems to know that it's over just before it is,"" Rackauckas said of the video. ""Officer Ramos had prior contact with Kelly Thomas and he knew Kelly Thomas and who he was. He was a homeless drifter who frequented that area,"" Rackauckas said. In all, prosecutors also reviewed video from two cell phones and bus camera videos, statements by 151 witnesses, police reports written by all six officers, the coroner's report, medical reports, and the batons and Tasers of the officers, Rackauckas said. Asked about the charged officers' motive, the prosecutor responded: ""That's a pretty good question. It just appears from watching the video that the officer became increasingly angered with Kelly Thomas as this goes on."" ""Ramos is accused of instructing Thomas to put his legs out straight and place his hands on his knees, but Thomas had difficulty following Ramos' instructions,"" Rackauckas said in his statement. ""Thomas appeared to have cognitive issues."" The physical altercation began at 8:52 p.m. and lasted nine minutes and 40 seconds until Thomas was handcuffed and no longer moving, the prosecutor said. ""Throughout the physical altercation, Thomas struggled, yelled and pleaded, 'I can't breathe,' 'I'm sorry, dude,' 'Please,' 'OK, OK,' 'Dad, dad,' and 'Dad, help me.' Thomas was severely bleeding but the officers did not reduce their level of force. Throughout the struggle, Thomas' actions were defensive in nature and motivated by pain and fear,"" the prosecutor added in a written summary of the incident. Cicinelli is accused of kneeing Thomas twice in the head and using his Taser four times on him, including three times as a ""drive stun,"" or direct application on the skin, for about five seconds each, the prosecutor said. The fourth time was a dart deployment, in which two darts connected to wires are ejected and stick to the skin or clothing, for about 12 seconds. ""Thomas screamed and yelled in pain while being Tased,"" the prosecutor's summary said. Cicinelli is accused of using the stun device ""unreasonably and unnecessarily"" because Thomas was pinned to the ground by several officers and was vulnerable with his head and face exposed, the prosecutors said. ""The biggest shame about this case is the fact that it could have been avoided,"" Rackauckas said in his statement. ""This never had to happen, and it never should have happened."" After announcing the charges during a news conference, Rackauckas held a private meeting with Ron Thomas and his attorney. After that meeting, Ron Thomas told reporters that he was ""very, very happy"" with the outcome of the prosecutors' investigation. ""Tony Rackauckas made it very clear that this murder charge will not be reduced,"" Thomas told reporters. ""We came in here expecting the worse and got the best. He's extremely serious about prosecuting to the fullest extent."" CNN's Sandra Endo contributed to this report.","A Fullerton police officer pleads not guilty to involuntary manslaughter .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A German-born man known for masquerading as a Rockefeller has been ordered to stand trial for murder, the prosecutor's office said Wednesday. Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter is accused of killing a man who disappeared in the mid-1980s and whose bones were discovered in his mother's Southern California backyard nine years later . After a five-day preliminary hearing, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Jared Moses ruled Tuesday there was sufficient probable cause to bind Gerhartsreiter over for trial, said Jane Robison, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. Gerhartsreiter, 50, is scheduled to be arraigned on February 9, Robison said. The dismembered remains of John Sohus, who was 27 at the time of his 1985 disappearance, were found in 1994 by workers installing a backyard pool at a home his mother once owned in San Marino, California. At the time of Sohus' disappearance, Gerhartsreiter had been renting a guesthouse from Sohus' mother, Robison said. During the preliminary hearing, a pool builder described how he discovered a skull buried in the yard, and investigators eventually found nearly an entire skeleton. The remains were not identified until 2010. Evidence showed that the bones belonged to Sohus, Robison said. During the preliminary hearing, Moses rejected a defense request that Gerhartsreiter be referred to as ""Mr. Rockefeller"" in court. The defense attorney said he and other attorneys on the team knew Gerhartsreiter as ""Mr. Rockefeller."" Gerhartsreiter, who has led a life of multiple identities, has denied involvement in the Sohus case. At one point in his life, Gerhartsreiter assumed the identity of ""Clark Rockefeller,"" a cultured poseur who never seemed to have a job. A Boston tabloid dubbed him ""Crockefeller."" There has even been a Lifetime movie, ""Who Is Clark Rockefeller?"" starring Eric McCormack as Gerhartsreiter. Gerhartsreiter has been serving a four- to five-year sentence in Massachusetts for kidnapping his then-7-year-old daughter from his ex-wife in 2008. He was transferred from a prison in that state to California in July, authorities said. Gerhartsreiter's bail in California was set at $10 million, but that bail is moot because he is being held on the Massachusetts sentence, Robison said. The whereabouts of the dead man's wife, Linda Sohus, are unknown. Except for a few postcards that appeared to have been mailed by the couple from Paris in 1985, her friends and family have not heard from her. A spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office has said her disappearance is still under investigation. Gerhartsreiter's Massachusetts prison term will end in mid-2012, authorities said. He will receive credit for that Massachusetts sentence while being held in California, authorities said. Gerhartsreiter came to the United States from Germany in 1978, according to testimony at his trial for kidnapping. After spending a few years in Connecticut, he moved to Wisconsin, where he married in a green card arrangement using his true name. Gerhartsreiter then relocated to California. He settled in San Marino, a wealthy community near Pasadena, where he lived under the name Christopher Chichester from 1983 to 1985. He posed as a film student and boasted that he was of English royalty, according to Vanity Fair magazine, which profiled him in January 2009 and quoted several people who knew ""Chichester"" at the time. As Chichester, he rented a guest house from Ruth ""Didi"" Sohus. Her son John and his wife, Linda, came to live with Didi Sohus during the time Gerhartsreiter lived in the guest quarters. His relationship with the couple is unclear. Didi Sohus told investigators she believed that her son and daughter-in-law were in Europe after she and one of Linda Sohus' friends received Paris-postmarked cards in mid-1985, purportedly from the couple. Investigators were suspicious of the cards' authenticity. Sohus sold the house in late 1985 after suffering a stroke. She died three years later. Through luminol testing of the guest quarters where Chichester lived, investigators found what appeared to be a large amount of blood. (Luminol causes a glow when it comes in contact with blood.) It is not clear when the luminol testing took place, but police thoroughly searched the house when the remains were found and again after Gerhartsreiter's arrest in the kidnapping case. A former neighbor quoted by Vanity Fair reported that Chichester borrowed a chainsaw from him around the time the couple went missing. An acquaintance, Dana Farrar, said she ""saw an area of dirt that had obviously been dug up and filled in"" at the time, according to the Pasadena Star-News. When she asked him why, Chichester told her he was having plumbing problems. Sheriff's detectives from Los Angeles County sought Chichester for questioning in early May 1985, but he had disappeared in a pickup registered to John Sohus. He resurfaced under yet another identity, that of Christopher Crowe, in Connecticut in the late 1980s. In late 1988, Crowe tried to sell Sohus' pickup to a man in Connecticut. When he couldn't produce the proper paperwork for the truck, the prospective buyer reported him to police. Connecticut police soon learned that Chichester and Crowe were the same person, although at that time, no one knew that his true name was Gerhartsreiter. Crowe disappeared before police could question him. He resurfaced in Manhattan in 1993 as Clark Rockefeller. Authorities learned shortly after the 2008 kidnapping of his daughter that Gerhartsreiter was not Clark Rockefeller. He was arrested in Baltimore, where he was hiding out with the daughter. He had already assumed a new identity: a ship's captain named Chip Smith who, with his daughter, Muffy, was relocating to Chile. His second wife, Harvard-educated financial executive Sandra Boss, testified that she spent more than a dozen years with him before growing suspicious that ""Rockefeller"" was not who he said he was. They met in New York and were married in Nantucket, Massachusetts. Their daughter, Reigh, was born on May 24, 2001, and her father nicknamed her ""Snooks."" The couple divorced in 2007 after Boss hired a private investigator to conduct a background check, according to testimony at the kidnapping trial.","Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter went by the name Clark Rockefeller .

"Quito, Ecuador (CNN) -- Paola Concha is openly homosexual and is not afraid to speak about her sexual orientation publicly. But the 28-year-old Ecuadorian woman says her family didn't feel the same way. Five years ago, when she was 23, she says, her family contacted a center that promised to cure Concha of her homosexuality. That, she says, is when her nightmare started. ""On December 8 of 2006, they stormed into my house, overpowered me, they put me inside a van and took me to a so-called 'therapeutic' center. By the time I got there, I was already handcuffed and beat up,"" Concha said. The clinic was called Puente a la Vida, or Bridge to Life. In December, CNN was granted limited access to the clinic. It looked like a mid-level tourist resort with buildings, houses and meeting rooms where patients were treated. The facility is located on the outskirts of Quito, Ecuador's capital. Concha says she endured all kinds of demeaning and abusive treatment during the 18 months she was held there. ""I was kept in handcuffs for more than three months. I would be left without food for more than three or four days. They would handcuff me in a bathroom to a toilet bowl facing a toilet that was used by 60 people at the center,"" Concha said. While we were there in December, one of the clinic's directors by the name of Luis Zavala declined to speak specifically about Concha's allegations. But he did deny that their goal was to change the sexual orientation of their patients. Their objective, Zavala said, was ""to modify all inadequate behaviors that are causing a particular individual to take inadequate attitudes."" Government officials say this case is not isolated. In fact, they have found dozens of clinics that illegally offer treatments to ""cure"" homosexuality. Some of these clinics operate as addiction treatment centers, but they offer homosexuality cures in a clandestine way. Some are located in urban settings, officials say, but many others are set up in ranches or houses in remote areas and attract clients by word of mouth. After the first allegations were made, Bridge to Life was targeted for an investigation last year. But officials could get only enough evidence to cite the clinic on a technicality. ""They say they found expired products. I would venture to say that the government has an ulterior motive,"" Zavala said. Juan Moreira, Ecuador's undersecretary of health, says expired products were indeed found in the women's area of the clinic, so they closed that section. But that was only the beginning. ""That was really not the most serious violation,"" Moreira said. ""What concerns us is that we have reports about their methods to change a person's sexual orientation and treatments that include torture and human rights violations."" Since CNN visited Bridge to Life, the Ecuadorian government says, two raids were conducted at the clinic. More than 40 people were freed and the clinic was finally shut down for alleged human rights violations. Moreira says people being held there were reluctant to speak at first, apparently afraid of being punished by clinic personnel if they spoke about the treatment center in a negative way. But then, one by one, patients started telling investigators horror stories. Their testimonies, Moreira says, mirror Paola Concha's story. After the clinic was shut down, CNN's efforts to reach its director, Zavala, for a comment have been unsuccessful. Meanwhile, Concha has become a spokeswoman for the movement against clinics that claim to cure homosexuality and is working with organizations that aim to raise awareness on this issue. One such organization is Artikulacion Esporadika, a gay rights group in Quito. Cayetana Salao, the organization's director, says that thanks in part to their efforts on this issue, the government has investigated and shut down 30 such clinics since July. ""These are all private clinics. They reflect our society's biases and misconception about homosexuality. We still have a lot of homophobia and misogyny,"" Salao said. ""Many people still consider lesbianism a disease and a psychiatric disorder."" A change in leadership at the Health Ministry is also good news for gay rights organizations. Carina Vance, a former executive director of Fundacion Causana, a gay rights group, and a respected gay rights activist in Ecuador, was named health minister earlier this month. Under her leadership, three raids have already taken place in the Quito area, and dozens of women have been rescued. Moreira, the health undersecretary, says new regulations for addiction treatment centers were implemented last year. Out of 302 centers they have investigated, 208, or 69 percent, were found to be in violation of one or more of the new regulations. The government, Moreira says, is aggressively investigating reports of clinics supposedly offering to cure homosexuality. As a matter of policy, the undersecretary says, Ecuador does not recognize it as a disease and therefore anybody offering to ""cure"" it is in violation of the law.","Paola Concha says she was beaten at clinic trying to ""cure"" her homosexuality .

"(CNN) -- A man suspected of kidnapping and sexually assaulting an 18-year-old woman was shot by his captive, police in Mount Juliet, Tennessee, said Friday after the man's body was discovered in neighboring Mississippi. The incident began Wednesday afternoon when police say suspect Stephen Cronk, 58, asked the woman to meet at a Mount Juliet gas station after she got off work. The man told her he was moving away and wanted to meet with the woman, a prior acquaintance, one last time, police said. The woman agreed to the meeting. The woman willingly got into Cronk's truck before he pulled out a handgun, according to police. Cronk proceeded to restrain the woman to the seat using duct tape, police said, then drove to a hotel in Aberdeen, Mississippi, about 250 miles away. At the hotel, the woman was forced to perform sexual acts on Cronk, according to police. At one point, the woman asked Cronk to get her a drink. While he was doing so, she managed to get control of the gun and shot him in the stomach, according to Aberdeen Police Chief Henry Randle. After the shooting, the woman locked herself in the bathroom until she heard Cronk leave the hotel, Randle said. Cronk's body was discovered Friday in his 2004 Nissan pickup by a gas station clerk at a local truck stop about 15 miles from the hotel. He was pronounced dead at the scene. An autopsy is being performed to determine the cause of death. The woman has been returned to her family in Gallatin, Tennessee, Mount Juliet police said.","The woman managed to get control of the suspect's gun and shot him, police say .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Five Israeli right-wing extremists have been indicted by an Israeli court which accused them of attempting to prevent the demolition of illegal settlements in the West Bank, organizing a break-in at a military base and planning riots. The extremists are also suspected of masterminding an attack on an Israel Defense Forces base in the West Bank on December 13. In that incident, about 50 extremists infiltrated and attacked the Ephraim Regional Division Headquarters. The activists entered the base, damaged property, set tires on fire, threw stones and damaged vehicles, according to an IDF statement at the time. A commander's car was attacked, and he sustained minor injuries. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the incident ""crossed all lines."" And Matan Vilnai, deputy defense minister, called the perpetrators ""Jewish terrorists"" in an interview on army radio. Israeli media reported in December that the attack came in response to rumors that Israeli security forces were about to demolish two illegal outposts in the West Bank. The indictment alleges the extremists operated from an apartment in Jerusalem, where they gathered intelligence information through surveillance, lookouts and patrols of Israeli troops. The intelligence was aimed at preventing ""the evacuation of outposts by illegal means"" and to prevent IDF operations, said the indictment, which was presented in court Sunday. ""The indictment exposes the true and ugly face of the prosecution that proves once again the blatant discrimination against the settlers,"" said Adi Keidar, an attorney representing three of the five. The suspects are also being questioned about ""price tag"" attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank and Jerusalem, according to Israeli police. ""Price tag"" is a term used to describe attacks by Israeli extremists against Palestinians and Israeli security forces in retaliation for any action taken against settlers.","The extremists are accused of collecting military information .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- An American woman who was trampled to death by an elephant in Kenya, where she lived with her family, was a librarian who was determined to see that schools and libraries be built in poor villages, a former boss said Wednesday. Before moving with her husband to the Kenyan capital of Nairobi in 2006, Sharon Brown was a reference librarian at Antioch University New England in Keene, New Hampshire, said library director Marcy Leversee, who hired Brown in 2005. Brown and her toddler daughter, who also died in the incident, were on a guided forest hike Monday near the Castle Forest Lodge, about 65 miles north of Nairobi, when the incident occurred, said lodge spokeswoman Melia Van Leer. Van Leer speculated the elephant was in a herd of about 20 that were spotted later in the day with their calves. Elephants can be particularly defensive when they are sheltering their young, she said. In Nairobi, Brown was a librarian at the International School of Kenya, according to a security guard at the school. Her husband, Jeff, worked there as a fifth-grade teacher, according to the school's Web site. Sharon Brown only spent a year at Antioch, Leversee said, because when she got the opportunity to work in Kenya, she felt it was a chance that was too good to pass up. At Antioch, she worked with graduate students in environmental sciences and clinical psychology. ""Sharon was a quiet, open person. Very present,"" Leversee said. ""She believed that every exchange was a mutual learning. She opened the exchange by listening. ""She was a cherished colleague,"" Leversee said. ""To me, she was a citizen of the world in the finest sense."" The Browns became passionate about Africa after serving in the Peace Corps, Leversee said. That was where Sharon Brown became committed to promoting education. Leversee said she didn't know where they served, but Sharon Brown ""had an affinity for Africa."" Brown had said that while in the Peace Corps, she totally immersed herself in the culture of the villagers, even asking the women to teach her how they washed clothes. A Peace Corps supervisor told Leversee that Brown provided the women and children with their very first books. Leversee said she didn't know the name of the village. According to Van Leer, the property around the lodge is full of elephants, but encounters with humans ""don't normally end in tragedy."" There have been no tragic incidents with elephants in the area since 2001, she said. ""This area has wild animals, and I always warn my clients and everyone else to be aware of the danger,"" she said. ""But from now we won't allow children out anymore. The young child could have been saved."" The U.S. Embassy in Nairobi refused comment Wednesday. CNN's David McKenzie, Melissa Gray and Deb Krajnak contributed to this report.","Sharon Brown worked in the library of the International School of Kenya .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Senate has moved quickly, in Washington terms, to confirm a replacement for slain federal Judge John Roll, killed in the mass shooting at a Tucson shopping center in January. Jennifer Guerin Zipps was elevated from a magistrate to a seat on the U.S. District Court in Arizona. She works in the same Tucson courthouse as her predecessor. As a former federal prosecutor Zipps, 47, had appeared often in Roll's courtroom. President Barack Obama nominated Zipps in June, and she was confirmed late Monday by a Senate voice vote. The seat was declared a ""judicial emergency"" because of Roll's death, other bench vacancies, and a rapidly growing caseload fueled by illegal immigration cases. Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, praised the bipartisan cooperation that led to the relatively swift action on Zipps, saying it ""sets the benchmark for how judicial nominations should be being treated."" Senate Democrats have been pushing for similar action on another pending District Court nominee in Arizona, Rosemary Marquez. Five other judicial nominees also were confirmed by the Senate this week. Democrats and Republicans have been at odds over the pace of confirming judges for lifetime positions on the federal bench. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, ranking GOP member on the Judiciary Committee criticized the president for not moving faster to fill the Roll vacancy. ""It was deemed to be a judicial emergency instantly. However, it took over five months for the administration to nominate"" Zipps, Grassley said. Roll, 63, was among five killed by gunfire outside a Safeway store January 8. Thirteen others were wounded, including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona. The suspect, Jared Lee Loughner, is being forcibly medicated to determine whether he will someday be competent to stand trail on capital murder charges.","Judge Jennifer Guerin Zipps, nominated in June, wins approval .

"(CNN) -- The stern of a cargo ship that ran aground last year on a reef off the coast of New Zealand has slipped further underwater, officials said Tuesday, spewing nearly 10 more tons of oil into the sea. Some 21 containers holding a hazardous metal called cryolite -- a by-product of aluminum smelting -- have also slipped off the vessel as it plunged downward, said Maritime New Zealand spokeswoman Michele Poole. ""We had significant storms last weekend and the seas really have not subsided,"" added Poole. ""So it's very rough out there."" Authorities say they do not consider the metals dangerous because they are wrapped in plastic within the container. Should the containers break apart, Poole noted, the metals' toxicity levels would likely be diluted by the surrounding sea water. The metals are not thought to pose an environmental risk, she said. Still, emergency management teams were again placed on alert after monitoring devices aboard the ship -- named the MV Rena -- indicated Tuesday morning that the vessel had further slipped off the Astrolabe Reef, located about 12 nautical miles off the city of Tauranga. Authorities said six little blue, or korora, penguins have since been recovered after new pockets of oil surfaced later Tuesday, but added that they do not expect a need for a major recovery effort. The Liberian-flagged vessel struck the reef in October and has split in two. About 300 tonnes of oil have since leaked from the ship's hull, prompting the country's environment minister to call the spill New Zealand's most significant maritime environmental disaster. Between 200 and 300 containers, comprised mostly of wood and milk products, were also lost overboard when the ship broke apart . ""There is inevitably going to be a lot of mess and disturbance for the next few days while this is cleaned up and we would like people to use common sense and stay well away from the debris -- in some cases this will mean staying out of the water as well as away from material washed up on the beach,"" National On Scene Commander Alex van Wijngaarden said in a statement. Debris from the vessel washed up on a local beach Monday, and a sheen of oil remains visible around the vessel. But officials say they remain wary of committing personnel, particularly underwater crews, to the crash site. ""The wreck is highly unstable,"" noted Poole. ""So it's not worth us risking sending divers down there."" A barge equipped with special cranes, shipped from Singapore, has since taken part in recovery effort, she added.","Some 21 containers holding a hazardous metal called cryolite also fall into the water .

"(CNN) -- The city of Cleveland, Ohio, on Tuesday morning will demolish the house where serial killer Anthony Sowell hid the bodies of his victims, officials said. A jury convicted him in July for kidnapping, abuse of corpses and the aggravated murder of 11 women around Cleveland from 2007 to 2009. In August, he was sentenced to death. The convictions ended a saga that began in October 2009 with the discovery of the first two victims' remains in Sowell's home in Cleveland. He eventually was accused of killing at least 11 women ranging in age from 25 to 52. Sowell's inconspicuous two-story home sat in a dilapidated Cleveland neighborhood known as Mount Pleasant. A stench hovered around the area, but no one initially realized it was the smell of decaying human flesh, instead assuming that it was a byproduct of a nearby sausage factory. In a letter to the families of Sowell's victims, Blaine Griffin, executive director of the Cleveland Community Relations Board, said the demolition ""is an important step in helping our community heal and move forward."" ""In order to prevent actions that would be disrespectful to the memory of your loved one, your family and our community, the demolition will be performed in such a way that no piece of the property will remain,"" Griffin wrote in the letter.

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- Spanish police Tuesday arrested a Spanish soldier and his Russian girlfriend for allegedly posting videos on the Internet promoting Islamic extremist views and calling for attacks in Spain, a Ministry of Interior statement said. Spanish police released these images of Christian Peso Ruiz Coello, left, and Maria Choubina. The suspects, both 23 years old and practicing Muslims, were arrested in the southern Spanish city of Granada. They were identified as Christian Peso Ruiz Coello, born in Granada, and Maria Choubina, born in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) in 1985. The investigation began last June when police detected videos on the Internet that called for Islamic attacks in Spain, and specifically in Granada, the last outpost of the Muslim Moors in medieval Spain, with its fabled Alhambra palace that still stands. The suspects posted 11 radical videos seen 2,007 times on the Internet and had online contact with 200 people in Europe and the Middle East who were favorable to a so-called ""international jihad,"" the ministry said. Their videos allegedly aimed to inspire Islamic extremists to carry out attacks, using messages such as a call to liberate ""Al Andalus,"" the vast portion of Spain under Muslim rule for centuries during the Middle Ages until the Catholic monarchs conquered the last bastion of Granada, in 1492. The videos also allegedly portrayed offenses against Muslims who live in modern Spain, including many in Granada. ""This activity aimed to increase the threat in our country by terrorist groups and elements linked to the 'global jihad,'"" the ministry statement said. Police searched the homes of the suspects, in the operation supervised by Spain's anti-terrorism National Court in Madrid.","Spanish soldier, Russian girlfriend held for allegedly promoting Islamic extremism .

"RIVERDALE, Georgia (CNN)  -- In his darkest moment, Kenneth Brown lost it all. His wife and kids, the housebroken dog, the vacation home on Cape Cod all vanished when he was sent to prison for an arson in 1996. Kenneth Brown, a former inmate, learned to meditate during his nine years in prison. Trapped in his gloomy cell and serving a 20-year sentence that felt like an eternity, Brown, then 49, found himself stretched out on the floor. He was silent. His eyes were shut. His body did not move. Brown, a man raised as a Baptist and taught to praise the Lord and fear the devil, was meditating. ""I try to focus on the space between two thoughts, because it prevents me from getting lost,"" said Brown, who discovered meditation, yoga and Buddhist teachings three months into his sentence. ""This helped me stay on track and get me through prison,"" he said. Eastern religions encompassing meditation techniques have captivated hippies, 20-somethings and celebrities like actor Richard Gere. But since the 1960s, the art of meditation also has found a growing number of unlikely followers behind prison bars. The inmates say meditation -- an ancient practice that develops mental awareness and fosters relaxation -- is teaching them how to cope in prison. ""Mostly, the people in Buddhist community are going into the prisons, providing programs, and word of mouth gets from one inmate to another,"" explained Gary Friedman, communications chairman for the American Correctional Chaplains Association. ""It's a break from all the hustle and noise of the prison environment."" There is no group tracking the number of inmates converting to Buddhism or engaging in meditation practices. But programs and workshops educating inmates about meditation and yoga are sprouting up across the country. Meditation can help the convicts find calmness in a prison culture ripe with violence and chaos. The practice provides them a chance to reflect on their crimes, wrestle through feelings of guilt and transform themselves during their rehabilitative journey, Buddhist experts say. In the past five years, books like the ""Prison Chaplaincy Guidelines for Zen Buddhism"" and ""Razor-Wire Dharma: A Buddhist Life in Prison"" have emerged. ""This is transformative justice, as opposed to punitive,"" said Fleet Maull, founder of the Prison Dharma Network, one of the largest support networks helping inmates learn meditation and Buddhist teachings. Since its inception in 1989, Prison Dharma Network has grown from one person -- Maull -- teaching Buddhist principles to more than 75 member organizations corresponding with 2,500 individuals, many of them inmates. For the past seven years, Maull's group has taught a weekly meditation class in Boulder County Jail in Colorado. Some inmates follow Zen Buddhism, a practice that originated in China, and meet weekly to focus their minds. Others practice Vipassana, a Buddhist practice founded in India, which consists of completing hundreds of hours of meditation in a short period of time. Buddhism has gained momentum in the United States over the past 25 years, becoming the third most popular religion in America behind Christianity and Judaism, according to the 2008 report from the the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life. About 1.7 million Americans call themselves Buddhists, and many of them are converts, the study said. According to the American Religious Identification Survey in 2008, there were 1.2 million self-identified Buddhists. Some inmates, like Brown, may not label themselves official Buddhists, but they meditate, practice yoga and follow Buddhist principles on truth, responsibility and suffering. The practice of meditation seeped into the heart of the Bible Belt in 2002. The Donaldson Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison in Alabama, was notorious for violence. But a group of male inmates, including several murderers, completed a Vipassana meditation retreat that required more than 100 hours of meditation in 10 days. One inmate, who was featured in the 2007 documentary ""The Dhamma Brothers,"" said Vipassana was harder than the 8½ years he had spent on death row. More than 120 men in Donaldson have gone through Vipassana at least once.  Watch a clip of ""The Dhamma Brothers"" » . ""They don't feel so close to exploding,"" said Jenny Phillips, director of the film. ""They aren't afraid to have conversations with people and to express themselves. They aren't always on edge."" Critics, including some prison officials, doubt that meditation works. They worry that it may be a tactic to convince parole boards to lighten a sentence. In areas that are heavily Christian, some wardens are uncomfortable with introducing Eastern religions. Alabama prison authorities were initially skeptical about meditation but next year will designate an open dormitory for inmates going through Vipassana, said Ron Cavanaugh, director of treatment for the Alabama Department of Corrections. He said corrections officers have seen lower levels of violence among Donaldson inmates who meditate. In California, a state where the swollen prison population has resulted in dangerously overcrowded prisons, teaching conflict management is critical, said Anne Seisen Saunders, a Zen Buddhist instructor who was raised Christian. Her Prison Meditation Project, based near San Diego, began a decade ago in one prison yard. Today, the program has expanded to five prisons, with an average of 20 inmates participating in each location. Last week, the autumn sky transformed from a deep purple to light blue outside Kenneth Brown's meager studio apartment. Inside, Brown sat on his bed, barefoot and deep in concentration, in front of a makeshift altar holding books a photo of the Buddha. Traces of incense billowed in the air. Brown, now 62, resides in Georgia to be near his family. He says he was wrongfully convicted of arson. In 2005, a Massachusetts appeals judge reduced his sentence from 20 years to nine. His body was motionless, his eyes closed and the palms of his hands facing upward. These days, Brown's practice of mediation helps him tackle the challenges of being unemployed with a felony record. The college graduate has been rejected from jobs catching stray dogs and cleaning hotel rooms. But he's got a lot to be thankful for: His daughters, his grandchildren -- and meditation, he said. ""I finally feel at peace.""","Programs across the country educate inmates about meditation and yoga .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- For actress Jane Alexander, the criticism of a $50 million boost in funding for the National Endowment for the Arts is a sequel. Tony-award winning actress Jane Alexander says giving money to the arts will save and create jobs. She was chairman of the agency from 1993 through 1997 when arts funding was cut sharply by the Republican-led Congress, which questioned whether it was an appropriate way to use government money. Now the issue is whether giving money to the arts should have been part of the economic stimulus program. Among those who have criticized the new spending this year is Lousiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who delivered the Republican response to President Barack Obama's message to Congress Tuesday. On Monday's ""Larry King Live,"" Jindal said, ""Fundamentally, I don't think $30 million for the federal government to buy new cars, $1 billion for the Census, $50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts is going to get the economy moving again as quickly as allowing the private sector to create jobs."" It's no surprise that Alexander disagrees and argues that arts spending can give a vital boost to the economy. The actress, who will appear later this month in a new comedy at the New York theater company Primary Stages called ""Chasing Manet,"" won a Tony Award for her role in the ""The Great White Hope."" She has been nominated eight times for an Emmy and four times for an Oscar for films including, ""All the President's Men"" and ""Kramer vs. Kramer."" Alexander spoke to CNN.com last week. CNN: What do you think of the controversy over the $50 million in increased government spending for the arts? Alexander: I think it's long overdue and I was very, very happy to see it. Since 1995-96 we had an incredibly decreased budget for the NEA. Finally we're getting back to where it was when I came in [as chairman]. It's all vitally needed. In fact, the endowment has not kept pace with inflation as other agencies have. ... This $50 million will certainly help a great deal. What people forget is that there are over 2 million people in the United States of America who are professional artists. Those are jobs like any other jobs. The artists have families, they have people for whom they're responsible and they give to their communities. We all have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The life part would be health and housing. The liberty part would be our civil rights. And the pursuit of happiness, the arts would come under that. And it's as vital a part of well-being in the United States as anything else. CNN: When you say 2 million artists, could you define artist? Alexander: Well they include everything from writers, painters, all the visual arts spectrum and that's pretty large, including graphic arts. Theater and so on, music, ceramicists, costume designers, makeup artists, filmmakers, it's a huge panoply. CNN: How far can $50 million go? Alexander: Well for the endowment which has had a budget of around $144 million currently, it can go quite a way. When I came in it was about $175 million and then it was cut under my aegis by Congress down to $99 million. CNN: Some people will say that while the NEA may consider this a victory, it's really a pittance, a drop in the bucket, so little money given the challenges many arts organizations are facing today. Alexander. It will help, it will help enormously, because every single NEA grant that goes out is a challenge to the community to come up with the same amount of money, or a 3 to 1. ... By the way, the public should know that within this coming year, we're going to see an awful lot of arts organizations closing. I just came from working at a theater in Pittsburgh, [Pennsylvania] and the International Poetry Forum, which has been going for 43 years, will close its doors this year. The Milwaukee Shakespeare Festival has already closed. The LA [Los Angeles] Opera has laid off 17 percent of its staff. CNN: So this isn't going to be enough to reverse those kinds of things? Alexander: No, but it will challenge the community to understand what the imperiled status of their arts organizations are. It will only help. It will help an enormous amount, and for some organizations, it will make all the difference in their staying alive. Now the NEA this fall gave out 884 grants, totaling $20 million and that was 38 percent of the project cost of the applicants. So 38 percent is a nice healthy piece of change for the cost of a project. CNN: How did you personally get involved in this cause? Alexander: As an actress who spent most of my career in nonprofit theaters, They began with the seed of an NEA grant back in the late 60s, most of them. Today we have about 450 nonprofit theaters across the United States. Back in 1965, when the NEA was founded, there were only about 23 of them. CNN: Your forthcoming play -- is that being done for a nonprofit theater? Alexander: Yes. It's another nonprofit called Primary Stages in New York City, a small theater. What people don't quite understand about theaters is that they never increase their size. They're bound by the number of seats within a given theater, and meanwhile there's inflation and the costs rise. So currently most theaters can never make more than 50 percent of their income from ticket sales. The rest has to be raised. CNN: How's the company doing? Alexander: It had a good play last year, ""Dividing the Estate,"" by Horton Foote, which got a lot of attention but I don't think it made back its nut on Broadway. It transferred from the nonprofit to a commercial venue on Broadway. ... In the film business, independent films are considered nonprofit in many instances. It's interesting to see that an independent won the Academy Award. Of course it was distributed by a major studio. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" started off as an independent. It did extraordinarily well. ... Many of the commercial arts are fed by the nonprofit arts. And that's another thing most people don't fully understand. Where do you think the Tom Hanks, the Cate Blanchetts of the world come from? They come from small venues that are independent and are nonprofit usually and then they move into the mainstream. CNN: What's your attitude about the future, under the Obama administration. Do you think there's reason for hope about the arts, or despair? Alexander: I think there's reason for great hope. President Obama has said repeatedly and he's said it for a couple of years now, that he thinks arts education is vital for children of all ages, starting right away. We have the arts in nursery school anyway, but he believes in institutionalizing the arts so it's part of the curriculum for every child in America. ... Everybody in all walks of life know people who are out of work presently or are about to be out of work. And the same is true for artists. I know so many artists -- for example visual artists, the gallery has closed or it's cut back. Theaters that are no longer going to do productions with more than five actors. And so on. So I know a lot of people out of work: costume designers, makeup people. And let's not forget all the ancillary jobs from having an arts organization in your neighborhood. That includes restaurants, taxicabs, whatever. CNN: Gov. Jindal said he didn't think the arts money should be part of the economic stimulus plan. Alexander: Well what he doesn't understand is that $50 million goes directly ... as a grant to organizations which employ people. It's quick and it's a system that works beautifully and it's done within a year.","Jane Alexander: Increasing funds for the arts is a good way to boost economy .

"(CNN) -- Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova out-fought Victoria Azarenka in three tough sets to win the season-ending WTA Tour Championships in Istanbul. The third seed completed a remarkable year with a 7-5 4-6 6-3 success over nearly two-and-a-half hours, becoming only the third woman to win the tournament on her first visit. The 21-year-old Czech has been totally dominant this week, winning all three of her group games before recovering from a set down to beat U.S. Open champion Sam Stosur in the semifinals. And this success means she now moves up to second place behind Caroline Wozniaki in the world rankings, after starting 2011 down in 30th position. The never ending women's world tennis tour . Kvitova told the official WTA Tour website: ""It was unbelievable tennis. We were both really fighting. ""Every game and every set was very close. Maybe I played better on the important points in the match but we both played some of our best here in Istanbul -- it was a final, so why not!"" And asked how this victory compared to her Wimbledon success, Kvitova told reporters: ""Winning a grand slam was a very big step. I don't know how it will be going home this time, but I think it will be similar. ""I will be world number two now and next season will be different. I may be the favorite all the time, and we will have to see how I cope with that."" Third seed Azarenka of Belarus was gracious in defeat, adding: ""It's hard to lose, but I'm glad I lost to such a champion who deserved to win this week. ""Petra was amazing today. She really did a great job because I gave it my all. The crowd kept me fighting all the way through -- they have been amazing all week. The match turned in the opening game of the final set when Azarenka squandered two break points on the Kvitova serve. She then took advantage of Azarenka's disappointment by making the crucial break of serve in the next game, taking the first chance she had to achieve it. It was Kvitova's sixth WTA Tour title of the season and in securing victory she became the first Czech to lift the coveted trophy since Jana Novotna in 1997. Meanwhile, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga has moved up to seventh place in the race to reach the climax to the men's tennis season with a hard-fought victory over Juan Martin Del Potro in the final of the Austrian Open in Vienna. The top-seeded Frenchman beat the Argentine second seed 6-7 6-3 6-4 to put himself in line for a place in the ATP Tour finals in London next month. Del Potro is up to 11th place in the points chase and also still has a chance of reaching London, with more points to be had at next week's Valencia Open.","Petra Kvitova defeats Victoria Azarenka in the final of the WTA Tour Championships .

"Tunis, Tunisia (CNN) -- Welcome to Tunis. It may have been the last flight into Tunisia. Tunis Air Flight 848 from Beirut, Lebanon. Throughout the flight I watched as the passenger in the seat behind me, an older Tunisian gentleman, got steadily more intoxicated on his bottle of Johnny Walker Black Label. Toward the end of the three-hour flight, he was asking fellow passengers in a loud voice if they wanted to join him in establishing a new party to promote democracy in Tunisia. When we took off from Beirut, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali was still president of Tunisia, and had ruled the nation since 1987. When we landed, cell phones started going off, my BlackBerry was buzzing like an angry hornet. Ben Ali had left. Further coverage on CNN Arabic.com . The stewardess informed us over the plane intercom that because of the general strike, we would not be able to retrieve our luggage, and because of the curfew we would not be able to leave the airport. This didn't seem to faze most of the passengers, who were busy discussing Ben Ali's departure. ""I'm glad he's gone,"" a businessman told me with a smile of quiet satisfaction. ""Things will be better now. The problems are over."" For the CNN crew, it seemed like our problems were just beginning. What can you do sitting in an airport? How do you cover the story from a plastic chair in the arrival hall? Camerawoman Mary Rogers of Cairo, Egypt, and I pondered our options, and they weren't good. There's only so much ""atmosphere"" you can get at an airport. A crew from Tunisian TV was videotaping soldiers next to the arrival hall. A large army truck pulled up, disgorging more soldiers. Our prospects were looking worse by the minute, until a large man approached me and asked if I needed a taxi. ""A taxi?"" I asked, taken aback. ""But there's a curfew, there are checkpoints and I can hear gunfire. How can you take us to the city?"" ""Everything is fine,"" he responded. ""I'll take you."" After some bargaining we settled on €40, a stiff surcharge, but I agreed. Better €40 than a night sleeping on a cold and gritty airport floor. We put our hand luggage in the boot, got in and started to leave the airport. ""The road is closed,"" someone shouted to us. I told Mary we had probably a less than 50% chance of making it to the hotel. The driver seemed to think I was optimistic. ""You realize I'm gambling my life to do this,"" he told me. But then added quickly ""Everything will be fine."" So fine, in fact, all the while he was smoking one cigarette after another, taking phone calls from relatives, some as far away as France, asking how he was. The highway from the airport was utterly deserted. Not a car, not a person. All the stores were closed. After about 10 minutes we arrived in the city proper, where we encountered our first checkpoint, a tank and an armored personnel carrier. We stopped, the driver told them we were going to the hotel. They responded that the main road was closed; we would have to take a detour. A few minutes later, another checkpoint. More soldiers, who ordered the driver out. They checked his papers, looked in the car, saw we were foreigners and let us proceed. A minute later, another checkpoint. The soldiers made us all get out. I showed them my passport, explained I had made the mistake of choosing Tunisia as a vacation destination. They didn't think that was funny. Nearby there were two young men on their knees, hands tied behind their backs. Unlike the previous checkpoints, this one was tense. The soldiers didn't like our presence, but eventually waved us on. The streets were strewn with trash, in some areas broken glass. It was by no means a scene of destruction, but it was clear that earlier in the day thousands of people had been there. The closer we got to the center of the city, the more soldiers we saw, as well as plain-clothes policemen carrying revolvers or automatic weapons. Where there were groups of soldiers, there were more young men on their knees with their hands bound. I looked down one street and saw three young men peering anxiously around a corner. Although it was quiet, something was afoot. ""Rawah!"" a soldier shouted at us as we drove by. ""Go home!"" ""We're almost at the hotel. Pay me now,"" the driver said. ""But where is the hotel?"" I asked. ""I see nothing."" ""There it is,"" he said, pointing to a large white siding in front of a building. ""Now hurry up and pay me. I need to get out of here and go home."" The main door was covered. A man stuck his head out from behind the siding and looked at us quizzically. ""Is this the hotel?"" I asked him. ""Yes, yes,"" he responded, motioning urgently. ""Come in quickly."" My ""less than 50% chance of success"" prediction was wrong. Welcome to Tunis.","CNN reporter, camerawoman have harrowing trip into Tunis .

"(CNN) -- The head of the Papua New Guinea military has been freed from detention by rebel soldiers, the Australian government said Thursday, as an attempted mutiny appeared to unravel. Yaura Sasa, a rebel commander, had earlier claimed that he had seized control of the Papua New Guinea Defense Force, confining its leader, Brig. Gen. Francis Agwi, and another senior officer to their residences. The Australian government -- which has a significant presence in Papua New Guinea, a country it used to administer -- said that Agwi had subsequently been released. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in a statement that it was important that ""order is fully restored"" in the Papua New Guinea armed forces. The unrest in the military came amid controversy in Papua New Guinea over who the rightful prime minister is. Sasa claimed he had taken control of the defense force in order ""to restore the integrity and respect for the constitution and judiciary."" He called for the immediate implementation of ""the supreme court decision relating to Sir Michael Somare's position as the prime minister of Papua New Guinea."" Somare has been a key figure in the Papua New Guinea political scene over the past four decades, helping to lead the country to independence in the 1970s. After being in and out of office over the years, he was elected prime minister in 2007. But he lost his position last year while recovering from heart surgery in Singapore. He now apparently contests the legitimacy of the current prime minister, Peter O'Neill. In a news briefing, O'Neill described the events at the military barracks as ""completely unnecessary."" He blamed Somare for the disturbances. ""We condemn the actions of particularly the Somare faction of our Parliament for creating such an environment where instability within the country and within the disciplined forces are being created,"" he said. The Australian government said O'Neill had told Ian Kemish, the Australian high commissioner in the capital Port Moresby, that the authorities ""were taking steps to manage the situation"" in the military barracks.

"Vicksburg, Mississippi (CNN) -- The overflowing Mississippi River dealt anguish to its namesake state Thursday, reaching a historic height at Vicksburg, sending backwater up the Yazoo River, which has swallowed a home owned by the governor, and claiming the life of a 69-year-old man. As the flood's trail of destruction worked its way south, Vicksburg saw the river crest at the expected peak of 57.1 feet early Thursday, hours ahead of the original forecast. The National Weather Service predicts the crest will hold through at least Saturday morning. ""Residents who live along the river need to keep an eye out and be vigilant,"" said Marty Pope, a senior hydrologist with the weather service's Jackson, Mississippi, office. ""We're not going to fall to the kind of levels we got to during the large 2008 flood until early June, and won't fall below flood stage until mid-to-late June."" Warren County Sheriff Martin Pace said the county, which includes Vicksburg, has ""several hundred homes that have water."" About 2,000 residents have been displaced, including nearly 1,000 who were evacuated from Eagle Lake 10 days ago. So far, a critical levee near the lake is holding. Many Warren County residents are accustomed to flooding and know what to do, but none have experienced it at this magnitude, Pace added Thursday. Also of concern is a traffic ""nightmare"" on the principal north-south highway, said Pace. ""We've never seen water that has closed U.S. 61,"" he said. Vicksburg motorists cannot take U.S. 61 to reach Redwood to the north or Port Gibson to the south because of flooded roadway. Instead, commuters are using two-lane roads that weren't designed for the volume, the sheriff told CNN. The river began cresting ahead of schedule Wednesday night, probably because an old levee system in Greenville, Mississippi, was breached last Friday and spread the flood's flow, Pope said. The Mississippi is more than 14 feet above flood stage at Vicksburg and more than a foot over the record set in the city in 1927. Water levels in Natchez, a city about 70 miles south, are already nearly 4 feet beyond the record, with the river at 61.9 feet Thursday night -- and the crest isn't expected to arrive until Saturday. A Vicksburg resident, Walter Cook, died after being pulled from floodwater in Warren County, Mississippi, the county coroner said Thursday. It is the first reported death linked to the flooding in the state. Emergency workers with the fire department pulled him from the water at 9:35 a.m. Tuesday and took him to River Regional Medical Center, where Cook was put on life support, Coroner Doug Huskey said. He died early Thursday. Officials do not know how Cook ended up in the floodwater, the coroner said. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was keeping a watchful eye on the Yazoo Backwater Levee, which residents near Vicksburg were counting on for protection. It is designed to keep water from backing into parts of the Yazoo River delta. The backwater levee was being ""armored"" by a heavy plastic coating to prevent it from washing out, said Charlie Tindall, attorney for the Board of Mississippi Levee Commissioners. But the Yazoo River backwaters were already claiming territory and property. Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour was among residents who watched rising waters swallow their houses and lands Wednesday. Barbour's spokeswoman confirmed that a house owned by the governor in his native Yazoo County was flooded. The house is on a lake in central Mississippi near the backwater-flooded Yazoo River. A slide was detected on the mainline Mississippi levee at Albemarle Lake, the Corps of Engineers said Thursday. A slide occurs when the integrity of a levee is undermined because dirt and sand are being eroded, said Corps spokeswoman Eileen Williamson. The slide was detected Wednesday and work began immediately to repair it.  ""It will take about a full week to repair,"" she said. Farther south, where the Mississippi River has not yet crested, residents were working to clear out their homes and find ways to get by. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has asked for federal assistance in grappling with flooding resulting from the Morganza Spillway, where 17 bays have been opened in hopes of sparing New Orleans further downstream. ""As water from the Morganza Spillway is released into the Atchafalaya Basin, the impact to our rural communities and the industries upon which they rely will be dramatic and long-lasting,"" Jindal wrote the U.S. Department of Interior, his office announced Thursday.  ""I am requesting your immediate consideration of available assistance and recovery programs for our recreational and commercial fishing, hunting, and eco-tourism industries."" Mandatory evacuations will be in effect Saturday -- beginning at midnight Friday -- in Butte LaRose, Happy Town and the Sherburne Wildlife Management Area, the St. Martin Parish Sheriff's Office said. By 8 a.m. Saturday, ""the area will be secured and no one will be allowed to enter,"" the parish said in a news release. Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Craig Fugate praised the efforts under way along the Mississippi.  ""Fortunately, the system is working as designed between the Army Corps of Engineers and the design structures and where they are having to open the spillways,  they've been able to take pressure off the mainline levee,"" he said at an event in Maryland. Officials said spillway gates are likely to be open for weeks, and it will be weeks before the river falls below flood stage, allowing those who have evacuated to return. The flood is the most significant to hit the lower Mississippi River valley since at least 1937. It has affected nine states so far: Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. Although recovery is a while off for areas that have already seen the worst of the floods, Tunica, Mississippi -- about 180 miles north of Vicksburg -- saw another step forward Thursday, with the return of a key economic driver for the region. The Tunica Roadhouse Casino reopened 4 p.m. Thursday, the second to return to business in two days with signs reading, ""We're back y'all."" Casino officials said the reopening celebration included a $50,000 donation to the American Red Cross. ""I didn't know if this day would come or not,"" said R. Scott Barber, the president for the mid-South region for the Caesars Entertainment group. ""It's hard to believe that, just a few short days ago, we had about 4 and a half feet of water in these parking lots."" CNN's Phil Gast and Ed Payne contributed to this report.","NEW: Tunica casino reopens, days after over parking lot was under 4 feet of water .

"(CNN) -- The winner of the Nobel prize in economics will be announced Monday in Stockholm, Sweden.

The three received the prize for research on how economic policy affects the job market. Their theories ""help us understand the ways in which unemployment, job vacancies and wages are affected by regulation and economic policy,"" the academy said. The three economists' research focused on so-called ""frictions,"" or impediments to trade, such as misinformation, cost of transportation or the disparity between companies' and employees' needs. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said that Diamond, Mortensen and Pissarides focused on how these frictions apply to unemployment, by focusing on the disconnect between employers and the unemployed. Part of the study examines why unemployment remains high when there are workers available to fill the job openings. Nobel prizes for peace, literature, chemistry, physics and physiology or medicine were awarded last week. The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to three women, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and Leymah Gbowee of Liberia and Tawakkul Karman of Yemen, on Friday ""for their nonviolent struggle for the safety of women and for women's rights to full participation in peace-building work,"" the committee said. Swedish poet Tomas Transtromer won the Nobel Prize in literature on Thursday. The Swedish academy said it gave the award to Transtromer ""because, through his condensed, translucent images, he gives us fresh access to reality."" On Wednesday, the prize in chemistry was awarded to Israeli scientist Daniel Shechtman. Shechtman is a professor at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and is known for his discovery of quasicrystals. On Tuesday, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences named Saul Perlmutter from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California, Berkeley; Brian P. Schmidt of Australian National University and Adam G. Riess of Johns Hopkins University and the Space Telescope Science Institute, the winners of the 2011 Nobel Prize in physics. They made the discovery that our universe apparently is expanding at an accelerating rate some 14 billion years after the Big Bang. On October 3, the Nobel committee named Ralph Steinman, a biologist with Rockefeller University, and scientists Bruce A. Beutler and Jules A. Hoffmann, the winners of the 2011 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine. The Nobel Prize for economic sciences has been awarded every year since 1969, when it was established by Sweden's central bank. The youngest laureate in economic sciences is Kenneth J. Arrow, who was 51 years old when he was awarded in 1972. The oldest winner is Leonid Hurwicz, who was 90 years old when he was awarded in 2007. He is also the oldest Laureate to be awarded the Nobel Prize in all areas.","The Nobel Prize for economic sciences has been awarded every year since 1969 .

"Lima, Peru (CNN) -- Thousands of Peruvians continued protests Wednesday that began in October, targeting as environmentally hazardous the continued construction of a $4.8 billion gold mining project called Conga. Eighteen people were hurt, several by gunshots, the department's director of health said. The protests continued despite Tuesday night's announcement by the U.S.-based firm Newmont Mining Corp. that work on the project in the northeastern department of Cajamarca would be suspended. Newmont, which is based in Denver, Colorado, and describes itself as one of the world's largest oil companies, said it had suspended construction on the project ""for the safety of employees and community members."" It noted that operations there and at the nearby Yanacocha mine ""have experienced intermittent work stoppages as a result of ongoing protests in the region."" The protests began when anti-mining activists expressed concern about the possible impact of the project on the local water supply, the company said in a statement on its website. ""The Conga Environmental Impact Assessment was approved in 2010 after extensive review by the Peruvian government which included significant engagement and consultation with local communities,"" it said. Gregorio Santos, regional president of Cajamarca, said that the central government announced the suspension of the project that critics say would adversely affect the area's ecosystem and would leave cattle in the zone without access to water. But Daniel Abugatas, president of the Congress of the Republic and a member of the Gana Peru Party to which President Ollanta Humala belongs, said such an outcome is improbable. As a candidate and now as president, Humala has pledged to respect contracts signed by previous governments. Although government functionaries say the controversy over the mine is a problem that Humala inherited from a former government, some analysts say that he handled the conflict poorly. One of them is Edwin Gonzales, an anthropologist who said that Humala told reporters on the first day of the protests that the mining project would go forward anyway. ""The terms of the handling have not been the most adequate on the part of the current government, because the affirmation that the Conga project is going forward does not allow the minimum conditions needed for dialogue,"" Gonzales said.","18 people are wounded in the protests in northeastern Peru .

"(CNN) -- Four-time African footballer of the year Samuel Eto'o has been banned for 15 games for his part in a players' strike, the Cameroon Football Federation has reported. Cameroon's national team captain was accused of inciting teammates not to play in a friendly against Algeria last month amid a row over bonus payments. The match in Algiers was eventually canceled. Cameroon's players claimed they had not received money promised for playing in a four-nation tournament in Morocco the weekend before. Eto'o, who joined Russian club Anzhi Makhachkala from Inter Milan in August in a multi-million dollar deal, was handed the toughest penalty, while vice captain Enoh Eyong, who plays for Ajax, received a two-match ban. Tottenham Hotspur defender Benoit Assou-Ekotto was also fined $1,980 for not appearing at the tournament in Morocco despite being called up. The players have 10 days to appeal the decision, the federation said. Cameroon will now have to embark on their qualification campaigns for the 2013 African Nations Cup and the World Cup in 2014 without their captain and talisman. The team also known as the ""Indomitable Lions"" failed to qualify for the African Cup in 2012, and were the first country to be knocked out of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.","Cameroon captain Eto'o accused of inciting teammates not to play in Algeria friendly .

"Washington (CNN) -- Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the gates of Quantico Marine Base in Virginia Sunday to protest the treatment of Bradley Manning, who is being held at the base prison on charges that he released classified government documents to WikiLeaks. Daniel Ellsberg, the 1971 Pentagon Papers leaker and Retired U.S. Army Col. Ann Wright who is known for being one of three State Department officials to publicly resign in 2003 as a way to protest the U.S. invasion of Iraq. See a CNN.com exclusive interview with Ellsberg as he talks about his kinship with Manning, and Ellsberg's experiences as an infamous war-time leaker. Manning, a 23-year-old Army private, is accused of giving WikiLeaks hundreds of thousands of classified military and State Department documents. He is awaiting a decision on whether he will face a court martial. The protesters marched near the base carrying placards, shouting slogans and chanting ""Free Bradley Manning."" They left flowers in front of an Iwo Jima monument at the entrance of the Quantico. Supporters of Manning and WikiLeaks also made speeches deploring Manning's alleged mistreatment in prison and asserted that the dissemination of secret military documents is vital for democracy. Later police arrested dozens of protesters for apparently blocking an intersection leading to the base. Prince William County police did not provide CNN information about the arrested protesters Sunday night, including what possible charges they might face. Reports that Manning has been held in near-total isolation and forced to sleep without clothing during his nearly eight-month detention has sparked outrage from human rights and peace activists. The controversy even played a hand in the resignation of former State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley, who reportedly suggested that the Defense Department is mistreating Manning. Ellsberg told CNN that Crowley ""acted honorably and boldly"" for remarking to a small group at MIT that Manning's treatment had been ""ridiculous, counterproductive and stupid."" Crowley resigned days after his statement. Ellsberg said Manning's imprisonment is illegal. ""The president could change this treatment of him. Apparently, (President Barack Obama) has been told by the Defense Department that this is appropriate,"" Ellsberg said. ""That's a terrible commentary on our standards, which means that they feel free to use illegal measures against someone in their custody."" Obama told reporters a week ago that he had been assured by the State Department that Manning is being treated humanely. Ellsberg said the Marines holding Manning should not wait for an order from Obama ""to stop disobeying the law."" Ellsberg said his opinion is shared by legal experts across the country. ""As a Marine I am ashamed that the corps is doing this,"" he said. Sunday evening, the protesters wrote their grievances in a open letter addressed to Obama and Defense Secretary Robert Gates. In addition to Ellsberg and Wright, the letter is signed by a number of musicians and actors, including Rosanne Cash, Michael Stipe of R.E.M. and actors Danny Glover and Viggo Mortensen. David House, a friend of Manning's, disputes that. House told CNN that he has visited Manning nine times since the soldier was taken into custody. House said that his friend recently appeared to be in ""decline mentally and physically."" House said Manning also has been reluctant during recent visits to discuss his treatment. Manning's attorney David Coombs has said that his client has been put on suicide watch and forced to stand at attention while naked. Military officials have said Manning has been forced to sleep naked to prevent him from committing suicide. ""There can be no conceivable justification for this type of degrading treatment,"" the letter from the activists says. ""It brings back memories of the abuses committed in Abu Ghraib, which blackened the reputation of America's armed forces,"" said the letter, referring to an Iraqi prison that was the center of a prisoner abuse scandal. The letter demands an immediate investigation into the conditions of Manning's detention. On Sunday, many of the 400 supporters, peace activists and veterans tried to enter an administrative building to deliver a letter to Base Commander Daniel Choike, but were stopped by police. It was the second straight day of rallies -- and arrests -- for many of the protesters, including those from antiwar groups Veterans For Peace, Iraq Veterans Against War and Code Pink, who attended a demonstration in front of the White House on Saturday to mark the eighth anniversary of the war in Iraq. For Ellsberg, Sunday marked his second arrest for the weekend. In 1971, Ellsberg who had worked as a top Pentagon official, leaked thousands of classified documents that revealed that top American officials had for years deceived the American public about the Vietnam War. Since the Pentagon Papers, Ellsberg has become an outspoken antiwar activist. CNN's Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.","Hundreds of demonstrators protest the treatment of Army private .

"(CNN) -- In an online confession to fans, reality TV celebrity Kim Kardashian on Tuesday addressed the public reaction to her pending divorce. The divorce paperwork was filed Monday, 72 days after her ""Fairytale Wedding"" to NBA player Kris Humphries, which was documented for an E! television special. ""First and foremost, I married for love. I can't believe I even have to defend this,"" she blogged on her website. In the posting, Kardashian talked about the pressures of reality television, saying she had a difficult time making the decision to film her wedding. ""I got caught up with the hoopla and the filming of the TV show that when I probably should have ended my relationship, I didn't know how to and didn't want to disappoint a lot of people,"" the post said. Though Kardashian says she accepts full responsibility for her actions, many have tried her in the court of public opinion. Blogs and social media posts have called for a boycott of shows featuring Kardashian and her family. The Kardashian family brand was built on openness, she wrote in her note. ""These were all real moments. That's what makes us who we are,"" she wrote.

"Kansas City, Missouri (CNN) -- Kansas City police said Saturday that they are glad the parents of a missing 10-month-old Missouri girl have resumed conversations with them. ""We couldn't be happier about it,"" police Capt. Steve Young said. ""Their involvement in this investigation is critical."" A meeting was held Saturday evening. Investigators have searched about 300 homes and apartments in the area around the home. Lisa Irwin hasn't been seen since Monday night. Federal authorities joined police in the search effort this week -- which included an inspection of a landfill and a nearby creek -- speaking with neighbors and sweeping the area with metal detectors. Police said they have no suspects or solid leads. Michael Lerette, a family spokesman for the parents of the missing infant, said police collected what could be forensic evidence in the case, but authorities have declined to comment on that claim. On Thursday, Young said the parents stopped cooperating with detectives. But a woman who identified herself as the sister of Jeremy Irwin read a statement late Thursday on behalf of her brother and Deborah Bradley, parents of missing the girl. ""We have never stopped cooperating with the police. We've been cooperative from day one and we continue to assist the police with the investigation,"" the statement by Ashley Irwin said. ""The main goal has always been to find Lisa and bring her home. That remains the sole focus of the parents."" Lerette said that the parents had been exhausted from questioning at the police station. ""I think it's just a lot of miscommunication, to be honest."" Lisa was last seen around 10:30 p.m. Monday, asleep in her crib, police said. Authorities were called to the home at about 4 a.m. Tuesday. ""It appears the suspect entered/exited through a bedroom window,"" authorities said in a statement. ""Evidence at the scene leads police to believe the child has been abducted."" Jeremy Irwin told reporters that he found Lisa missing when he got home from work. ""The front door was unlocked,"" he said Thursday. ""Most of the lights were on in the house, and the window in front was open -- all very unusual."" The couple also said three cell phones were missing at their home, according to Young. Lisa is described as 30 inches tall with blue eyes and blond hair, police said. She weighs between 26 and 30 pounds and was last seen wearing purple shorts and a purple shirt with white kittens on it. The missing girl has two bottom teeth, a small bug bite under her left ear and a ""beauty mark"" on her right outer thigh. She had a cold with a cough, police said.

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich will take a three-point lead into Germany's winter break after Bundesliga champions Borussia Dortmund and Schalke both won on Saturday to stay in contention. Bayern had moved six points clear with Friday's 3-0 win over Cologne, despite Franck Ribery's red card, but Dortmund followed suit by crushing lowly Freiburg 4-1 and third-placed Schalke dented Werder Bremen's title bid with a 5-0 triumph in the late match thanks to Raul's hat-trick. Fourth-placed Borussia Monchengladbach will seek to stay a point behind those two clubs with victory at home to Mainz on Sunday. Freiburg will end the year in bottom place after Dortmund's unbeaten run extended to 10 league matches, with Robert Lewandowski scoring twice to take his season's tally to 13. Ribery sees red but Bayern beat Cologne . The Poland striker opened the scoring in the seventh minute after being set up by young Japan international Shinji Kagawa, but Jan Rosenthal leveled on 34. Ilkay Gundogan put Dortmund back in front just before the break despite being initially flagged for offside as Jakub Blaszczykowski pounced on an error by Rosenthal, while Kevin Grosskreutz made it 3-1 before the hour after Kagawa combined with Lewandowski. Kagawa and Grosskreutz then helped Lewandowski to wrap it up with 20 minutes to play as Freiburg dropped below Augsburg on goal difference. Schalke joined Dortmund on 34 points after veteran striker Raul netted the opening three goals against fifth-placed Werder Bremen. The 34-year-old Spaniard put the home side 2-0 up after 20 minutes, with Dutch strike partner Klaas-Jan Huntelaar involved in both goals. He completed his third treble for the club since joining from Real Madrid in mid-2010 with a header just after the hour from Christian Fuchs' cross, taking his Bundesliga tally this season to double figures. Greek defender Kyriakos Papadopoulos added the fourth on 67 from Jose Manuel Jurado's cross, and Huntelaar scored his 15th league goal of 2011-12 with 20 minutes to play with a lob over goalkeeper Tim Wiese. Sixth-placed Bayer Leverkusen lost ground on the top teams after a 3-0 home defeat by Nuremberg, who joined 14th-placed Mainz on 18 points -- three above the relegation zone. Daniel Didavi and Jan Hegler put Nuremberg 2-0 up inside 22 minutes, while Tomas Pekhart's 73rd-minute header killed off a Leverkusen team who will face Barcelona in the last 16 of the European Champions League. Hamburg moved above Mainz despite being held 1-1 by Augsburg, meaning coach Thorsten Fink has yet to taste defeat in nine games in charge. Striker Torsten Oehrl put the visitors ahead just after the hour, but Paolo Guerrero bundled in an equalizer for Hamburg just five minutes later. Wolfsburg moved up to 12th with a 1-0 win over mid-table Stuttgart, as 20-year-old striker Sebastian Polter marked his second league outing with the only goal in the 74th minute. Hoffenheim and Hertha Berlin drew 1-1 in a mid-table clash that saw both teams reduced to 10 men. Sejad Salihovic put Hoffenheim ahead in the 21st minute then Raffael was sent off for lashing out at the Bosnian on the half-hour. Hoffenheim's Ghana center-back Isaac Vorsah was also dismissed for bringing down Adrian Ramos just after the hour, and Roman Hubnik netted a last-minute equalizer for the visitors.","Borussia Dortmund and Schalke keep pressure on Bayern Munich with victories .

"(CNN) -- A Baltimore man pleaded guilty Thursday in connection with a plot to bomb a military recruiting station in retaliation for U.S. forces killing Muslims overseas, authorities said. Antonio Benjamin Martinez, 22, a Muslim convert who also goes by the name Muhammad Hussain, pleaded guilty to use of a weapon of mass destruction against federal property in connection with the plot involving an Armed Forces Career Center in Catonsville, Maryland, the Justice Department said. The guilty plea was part of a plea agreement with prosecutors, authorities said. If the court accepts the plea, Martinez will be sentenced to 25 years in prison. Sentencing is set for April 6. Martinez was arrested in December 2010 after attempting to detonate an inert device supplied to him by an undercover FBI agent, authorities said. According to the plea agreement, Martinez first raised the subject of attacking military targets with an FBI confidential source in October 2010. During recorded conversations that followed with the source and later an undercover FBI agent, Martinez identified the recruiting station as a target and ""spoke about his anger toward America, his belief that Muslims were being unjustly targeted and killed by the American military, and his desire to commit jihad to send a message that American soldiers would be killed unless the country stopped its 'war' against Islam,"" federal prosecutors said. He also articulated his beliefs in postings on his Facebook page and in two Facebook chats with the source, the Justice Department said. He attempted to recruit people to join in the plot, authorities said. All of them declined, and one attempted to dissuade him from it. But Martinez agreed to meet the confidential source's ""Afghani brother"" -- the undercover FBI agent -- after the source told him the ""brother"" would be interested in helping. He told the agent that he wanted jihadist activities to be his ""profession,"" authorities said. On December 8, he met the source to drive to a public parking lot near the recruiting center and attempted to detonate the device. On the way, he had the source videotape him saying he would continue to fight ""against the oppressors until those who waged war with Islam stopped their actions,"" the Justice Department said. ""Martinez admitted that the bomb was intended to kill military service members who worked in the building,"" authorities said. ""This is an example of another successful prosecution that resulted from outstanding partnerships between the Muslim community and law enforcement,"" said Richard McFeely, FBI special agent in charge, in a Justice Department statement. ""As the threat from homegrown violent extremists remains high, the FBI and our police partners rely on a two-way flow of information with the Muslim community at large. Together we are working to stop those that have perverted the Islamic faith into something it is not."" Martinez's attorney argued in a December 2010 hearing that federal authorities set his client up in a sting operation. But Rod Rosenstein, the U.S. attorney in Baltimore, said at the time federal authorities ""don't initiate these investigations unless there is a credible allegation that the defendant himself (has) already expressed an intent to cause harm. And secondly, throughout the investigation, the FBI seeks to clarify the defendant's intent, challenging him, making certain that he's expressly told that he doesn't need to go forward with this.""","Man pleads guilty to use of a weapon of mass destruction against federal property .

"(CNN) -- AC Milan returned to the top of Italy's Serie A with a 2-0 victory at home to Siena on Saturday that put the defending champions a point clear of their main rivals. The win lifted Massimiliano Allegri's team above unbeaten Juventus and Udinese, who face Novara and fourth-placed Lazio respectively on Sunday. Milan could only draw with Bologna last weekend, and struggled to break down a Siena side hovering just above the relegation zone. But midfielder Antonio Nocerino broke the deadlock with a low shot 10 minutes after halftime for his sixth league goal this season, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic sealed victory with his fifth penalty in the last six Serie A matches. The Sweden striker stepped up in the 64th minute after Siena's on-loan Serbian goalkeeper Zeljko Brkic was ruled to have brought down midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng despite minimal contact. Milan, now unbeaten at home in 18 matches this calendar year, travel to Cagliari on Tuesday before the winter break begins. It was Ibrahimovic's 10th league goal this season, putting him level with Udinese forward Antonio Di Natale in second place in the scoring charts. They are one behind Atalanta's on-loan Argentine striker German Denis, who netted again in Saturday's pulsating 2-2 draw at Fiorentina. Former Italy striker Alberto Gilardino put the home side ahead in the ninth minute, but defender Andrea Masiello leveled for Atalanta with nine minutes to play. Denis, whose parent club is Udinese, put the visitors ahead in the 86th minute but 22-year-old Montenegro forward Stevan Jovetic replied soon after to leave both teams on 17 points after 15 games -- three above Siena. Chievo moved up to eighth place with a 2-0 win at home to Cagliari, as French striker Cyril Thereau scored 10 minutes before halftime and substitute Gennaro Sardo netted on 57. Thereau was on target for the second time this season, and also provided the assist for Sardo. The defeat left the Sardinians a point below their opponents in 11th.","Zlatan Ibrahimovic scores penalty in fourth successive Serie A match for AC Milan .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN)  -- How do you count six days when you can see neither sun nor stars? Buried under a crumbled building, Falone Maxi marked time by the roar of tractors and bulldozers, by the sound of voices. ""There's nobody alive in there,"" she heard them say. When there was silence, she believed it to be night. But Maxi, a deeply spiritual young woman, chanted the Lord's Prayer until she was discovered by Peruvian and Nicaraguan rescuers and pulled out of the rubble of Port-au-Prince's GOC University on January 18. ""I always knew I would keep breathing. I knew I would live,"" she said. But the miracle of rescue was only the first hurdle. Sixteen days later, she is struggling to navigate life anew. She bears physical scars as proof of her ordeal. A bandage on her left shoulder. A fractured hipbone. Cuts and scrapes cover her head and arms. It's harder to detect the inner damage of a young woman who gave her all to endure. Full coverage of Haiti earthquake, aftermath . That fateful day . In early January, Maxi was busy studying for final exams. She hadn't exactly wanted to pursue business administration. Since childhood, her dream was to become a nurse. But somehow, nursing school deadlines passed her by, and Maxi enrolled in a business program at the Groupe Olivier and Collaborateur University, known as GOC. The private college wasn't cheap -- $1,000 a year. But her brother took her under his wing, paid her tuition, even gave her a place to stay at his house. On that Tuesday, the house was empty by midmorning. Everyone had somewhere else to be. The normally bookish Maxi just wasn't in the mood for class. She might have even skipped except that her tuition was due. She reluctantly showered and put on the gray collared shirt she always wore to school with a pair of black jeans and sandals. She didn't wear much makeup -- just some powder and eyeliner, though she fussed over her hair and nails. She liked to get a manicure every five days with a fresh coat of baby pink on her toes. She wasn't hungry, but the housekeeper forced food on her plate. Rice, bean sauce, vegetables. She despised vegetables. She walked down to the bus stop and waited almost an hour before one carried her to Nazon in central Port-au-Prince. By the time, she reached the university, it was almost 3 p.m. She ran her errands and settled into class on the sixth floor with 20 other students. On this day, she took a seat by the door, though usually, she sat farther inside. The earthquake struck just minutes into the class. The building began to rumble and sway. Maxi thought shoddy construction was causing it to fall. A school in Port-au-Prince had collapsed that way recently. Everyone fled out the door. Maxi raced toward the stairwell, one sandal flying off her foot. A storm of dust rose before her. A block of cement struck her neck, and she fell on her back. Someone fell on top of her. It was Mica, a fellow GOC student. Mica's leg was broken, her foot crushed. Maxi felt blood on her own head. The two women lay conjoined like Siamese twins, unable to move, trapped under layers of pancaked concrete, mortar and metal. 'We're alive' There was no signal on Maxi's cell phone, but with the LCD light, she could see the cuts and bruises on Mica's face. She knew she probably looked the same. Above her, she could see the feet of the dead. Soon the rats would come to gnaw on fresh human flesh. The two women maneuvered themselves so they were not smothered by concrete. They curled up together, Maxi's legs bent over her chest to allow for breathing room. They took turns sleeping to keep their energy up. The other would stay awake and call out to the outside world. ""We're alive."" She could see the levels of the building underneath her. Occasionally, the earth trembled again, and more chunks came crashing down. When the phone finally gave out, Maxi's world went dark. She tore a page from a notebook and stuffed it up her nostrils. It wasn't enough to cover the wretched smell of human decay. As the days passed, Maxi thirsted for water. She used her hand to collect her urine and wetted her cracked lips. Search for the missing, found . Sister keeps vigil . Outside, Maxi's half sister, Carline Joaceus, kept vigil. The former model and waitress was fond of her. The two had talked about Maxi also pursuing modeling as a career. Nearly 5-foot-7, Maxi was tall enough but too shy, too reserved to display herself in public. It was to Joaceus that Maxi came with boyfriend tales and all the tribulations of a 23-year-old. The day after the quake, Joaceus had frantically run from one makeshift hospital to another in Port-au-Prince, searching for her sister. When she did not find her, she stood every day before the mound of the university building, watching rescue teams dig deeper. She watched students and teachers come out alive. Joaceus knew her sister's spirit. She knew Maxi was not dead. Nothing would convince her otherwise. 'I'm not dying today' When she was 14, Maxi's father, a gardener at El Rancho Hotel, was shot dead by fleeing burglars. The man who gave her everything was gone. She learned to jump-start life. Under the rubble, Maxi thought of her father. ""Give me strength,"" she said. She pointed a finger at God and made a pact. ""I'm not dying today."" Maxi wasn't much of a churchgoer -- she often skipped Sunday Mass. But she prayed twice a day, once in the afternoon and once before going to sleep. ""Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name,"" Maxi recited with Mica. ""We're going to die,"" Mica said. ""Don't do this to me. Where is your faith?"" Maxi replied. Maxi held Mica's hand tightly. She rubbed her back to soothe her. She believed God had put them there together for a reason. They were going to be one another's salvation. There were so many things Maxi wanted to do still. To gaze upon the pristine waters of the Caribbean at Wahoo Beach. The hues of turquoise and blue had mesmerized her when she went there a year ago with her brothers and sisters. She wanted to dance again, play tennis on her Wii. And hear Celine Dion's mellifluous voice. Saved . On Monday, rescuers finally reached Maxi and her friend. She doesn't remember details of how they were pulled out. Just that she could breathe again and savor the coolness of water trickling down her throat. And she could see her sister, waiting in the distance. Doctors said she was severely dehydrated and suffered a few fractures. Her blood pressure had dropped to 60/20. CNN staffers on the scene rushed Maxi to a field hospital. She was treated at three different locations before Joaceus was able to take her home four days later. On that ride, Maxi saw for the first time what the quake had done to her beloved city. Entire blocks collapsed, tens of thousands of people sleeping on the streets. ""Why? Why? Why?"" she asked God. She learned she could not go back to her mother's house. There were deep fissures and cracks in the walls. Her family was sleeping under sheets outside a neighbor's house. There, on the rocky dirt, among the chickens, Maxi's mother, Dieusana Joaceus, made her daughter a bed. Maxi cannot walk or bathe herself, though a doctor who came to see her recently said she might be able to stand within a few weeks. She eats only puréed food. The vegetable soup she disliked before is her favorite. Her sister massages Vaseline on her cracked skin. And fixes her hair with a pink and blue headband. On the bed is a Harlequin romance novel, though she prefers Nora Roberts or Danielle Steele, and a French-English pocket dictionary. Maxi said she plans to become a nurse now, as she had always wanted, so she can give to others the same second chance at life. Her mother and sister said their makeshift living quarters have been a saving grace. Maxi cannot bear to be inside anymore. She wants to leave Haiti because she knows she will never feel safe here. She cannot erase the smell of rotting flesh. She still feels the crush of concrete on her back. She knows there is video footage of her rescue but never wants to see it. ""Everything here reminds me of the earthquake,"" she said, managing to smile. ""I don't need reminders."" She constantly thinks about her time under the rubble and wonders how many of her friends have died. Who survived? She tried to call Mica, but believes she has gone to stay with family in New York. Maxi plans to find her. She is the only one who can understand.","Falone Maxi survives six days buried under fallen university in Port-au-Prince .

"(CNN) -- More then three years after a suspected cop killer died while in solitary confinement at a Maryland jail, a federal grand jury Thursday indicted a former jail guard in connection with the case. Anthony McIntosh, 48, a former corporal at the Prince George's County Detention Center outside of Washington, is charged with deprivation of civil rights and falsifying records in the June 29, 2008, death of Ronnie White. Prosecutors allege McIntosh failed to call for medical attention when he found White unresponsive in his cell. They also accuse him of attempting to cover up his involvement in the matter. White, 19, had been arrested two days earlier, charged with first-degree murder for allegedly running down Prince George's County Police Cpl. Richard Findley with a stolen truck. White passed a physical examination when he was admitted to the jail, was checked regularly in his solitary confinement cell, and was fine at 10:15 a.m. the day of his death, authorities said at the time. But when guards brought him his lunch 20 minutes later, he had no pulse. Initially, authorities said there was no sign of visible trauma to White, but an autopsy later revealed he died of asphyxiation and had two broken bones in his neck. Experts said it is virtually impossible for a person to strangle himself with his own hands. Seven corrections officials and an unspecified number of supervisors were the only ones authorized to be in White's cell, authorities said. Community leaders at the time decried White's death as ""vigilante justice,"" and many voiced suspicions that jailers had killed him. The indictment sidesteps the question of who, if anyone, killed White. But it says that McIntosh discovered White in his cell unresponsive, but ""walked away without providing medical care"" or notifying anyone. McIntosh thereby acted ""with deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of harm to (White), and resulting in bodily injury to, and the death of (White),"" the indictment reads. That inaction deprived (White) of his constitutional rights, which includes an inmate's right ""to be free from a correctional officer's deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs,"" the indictment said. McIntosh later concealed material facts when he wrote up incident reports, the indictment says. Specifically, McIntosh stated in his report that a corporal informed him White was unresponsive in his cell, but omitted that McIntosh had previously discovered him unresponsive and had left without notifying anyone. McIntosh was arrested Thursday in New York City by the FBI, the Department of Justice said. McIntosh faces a maximum penalty of life in prison for the civil rights offense. He faces up to 20 years in prison on each of two counts of falsification of records. The maximum fine for each count is $250,000. CNN was unable to identify and contact an attorney representing McIntosh. The case is being investigated by the Baltimore Division of the FBI and is being prosecuted by the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice.","Anthony McIntosh, 48, charged with depriving inmate of his civil rights, falsifying records .
